            <title>A concise natural history of East and West Florida; containing an account of the natural produce of all the southern part of British America, in the three kingdoms of nature, particularly the animal and vegetable. : Likewise, the artificial produce now raised, or possible to be raised, and manufactured there, with some commercial and political observations in that part of the world; and a chorographical account of the same. : To which is added, by way of appendix, plain and easy directions to navigators over the bank of Bahama, the coast of the two Floridas, the north of Cuba, and the dangerous Gulph Passage. Noting also, the hitherto unknown watering places in that part of America, intended principally for the use of such vessels as may be so unfortunate as to be distressed by weather in that difficult part of the world. / By Captain Bernard Romans. ; Illustrated with twelve copper plates, and two whole sheet maps. ; Vol. I.</title>

            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>PREFACES, at this preſent day, become ſuch impertinent things, that it is almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to offer one without an apology.</p>
            <p>The many different reports, which have prevailed in America, ſince the ceſſion af the Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, concerning their ſtate, ſituation and ſoil, joined to the natural deſire of thoſe concerned, to ſee a good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of thoſe ſo celebrated countries, i hope will be apology enough in the preſent caſe.</p>
            <p>Conſcious of being, from experience, ſufficiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to give a juſt account of them, i have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken the following ſketch, or out-lines of a future natural hiſtory of thoſe countries, in hopes that ſome abler hand may be thereby induced to take up the pen, and furniſh the world with a complete work of that kind for theſe provinces; being well aſſured, that no part of Britiſh America will furniſh the naturaliſt with more variety.</p>
            <p>I offer this humble attempt without any recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, or praiſes, of my own; only i beg to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure my reader, that i have, through the whole, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered ſo ſtrictly to truth, as to make no one devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therefrom willingly, or knowingly; guarding on the one hand againſt the miſrepreſentations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the authors of the numerous and noted puffs, concerning theſe provinces, have ſo plentifully inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larded
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:014440_0006_0F92654B4A69DCF0"/>
their labours; and on the other, againſt the prejudices of thoſe, who have taken ſo much pains to render this country undeſervedly deſpiſed.</p>
            <p>No elegance of ſtyle, nor flowers of rhetoric, muſt be expected from a perſon, who is conſcious that he is not ſufficiently acquainted with the language, to write in ſuch a manner as will pleaſe a <hi>critical</hi> reader, and if he has wrote ſo as to be intelligible, he hopes the candid will excuſe ſuch inaccuracies in compoſition as it is difficult for a foreigner to avoid.</p>

               <p>A DESCRIBER of countries, ought in a great meaſure, to imitate a building Engineer, in firſt laying before thoſe, whom he will employ, accurate and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct plans of his intended work, thereby enabling them to judge more diſtinctly of the execution thereof. I think that in a work of this nature, i could not do this better that by directing my readers to the charts or plans accompanying it, in which they will undoubtedly find materials to form juſt ideas of the places herein deſcribed.</p>
               <p>To reduce my work to ſome regularity, i ſhall proceed from the Eaſt, Weſtward, and begin with the Peninſula, dividing it into two parts, which i will call climates, the one beginning at Amelia or St. Mary's inlet, in latitude 31: and extending Southward to the latitude of 27:40: this will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the rivers St. Mary, Naſſau, St. John's or Ylacco, and the Muſketo Lagoon (for ſurely no one can call this laſt a river) beſides ſeveral ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler ones, which will be mentioned in their places;

theſe all empty themſelves on the Eaſtern ſide of the Apalachicola (the boundary between the two Floridas) the Oſkaùlaſkna the Apalachian, St. Juan de Guacaro, vulgarly called little Seguana, the river Amaxura, and the Manatee, which laſt falls into the bay of Tampe, or harbour of Spirito Santo, and which i have firſt diſcovered.</p>
               <p>The other, or Southern climate, beginning at the latitude 27:40: and extending Southward to the latitude of 25, on the main, or to 24:17: including the keys; this contains a large river, which empties itſelf into the new harbour, of which i am the firſt explorer, we have given it the name of Charlotte harbour, but neither harbour nor river have been deſcribed by the Spaniards in their maps, and the Spaniſh fiſhermen diſtinguiſh the place by the names of its inlets, which are five, and will hereafter be deſcribed; next is Carlos bay and Carlos harbour, into which the river Colooſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hatcha empties itſelf; further South are not any more deſerving the name of rivers, but ſuch as they are, i ſhall give them a place alſo; on the Eaſt ſide is only the river St. Lucia, with its Southern branch, the river Ratones, and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goon, known by the name of Aïſa Hatcha, Rio d'ais, or Indian river, ſome others can ſcarcely be ranked among rivers, but will likewiſe be more particularly mentioned hereafter.</p>

winter wet and ſtormy, but the latter part very dry and ſerene; from the end of September to the end of June, there is perhaps not any where a more delightful climate to be found, but all July, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, and moſt of September are exceſſively hot, yet the changes from hot to cold are not ſo ſudden, as in Carolina, and froſt is not frequently known, the noon day's ſun is always warm, the ſevereſt cold ever known there affects not the tender china orange trees, which grow here to a very great perfection, i ſcruple not to ſay, that this fruit here exceeds in goodneſs every other of the kind i have yet ſeen, however the change from the middle of this climate, to the Northern part of it is much more perceptible from heat to cold, than it was to the ſouthward from cold to heat, in the year 1770 and 1771. I felt very ſevere wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about the river Naſſau, and to the ſouthward of the town of St. Auguſtine, the climate changes ſo gradually, that it is not perceivable to the above named lat. of 27:40: where there is no froſt at all, and which I have always ſet down as the line of no froſt. From this line to the ſouthern extent is a moſt charming climate, the air almoſt always ſerene; on the eaſt ſide the common trade wind, and on the weſt ſide the Apalachian ſea breeze from the weſt to the north-weſt, refreſh this deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Peninſula during the ſummer; here we find all the produce of more northern climes mixed with the inhabitants of the Tropics, and this as well in the water as on the land, nor is there ever ſo great a cold as to deſtroy the fruits of the ſouth, nor ſo great a heat as to parch the produce of the north; in all this Peninſula it is remarkable, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

it falls, and this by either an immoderate dew or no dew at all, ſo that if a very heavy dew falls, it is a certain ſign of rain, and the ſame if on a calm fine night, there be no dew, but i cannot account for this phenomenon.</p>
               <p>The winds are not ſo very changeable here as they are further to the northward, but are during the greateſt part of ſpring, the whole ſummer, and beginning of autumn, generally between the eaſt and ſouth eaſt, and during the laſt of autumn, and firſt part of winter, they are commonly in the north eaſt quarter; the latter part of the winter, and firſt of ſpring they are more generally weſt and north weſt, the autumnal equinox is to be dreaded here, as well two or three weeks before, as two or three months after it, great ſtorms will then happen, and many veſſels are drove on ſhore, or otherwiſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled: I have never heard of much miſchief in the vernal equinox, and if a hurricane was ever known in this Peninſula, it was on the 29th of October 1769, when there was a terrible guſt between the lat. 25:10, and 25:50, which blew many trees down, and drove the Snow Led<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury a ſhore, where ſhe remained dry on a key, now diſtinguiſhed by her name, but heretofore conſidered as a part of what was improperly called by the name of Key Largo.</p>

terrible; at Mobile every thing was in confuſion, veſſels, boats, and loggs were drove up into the ſtreets a great diſtance, the gullies and hollows as well as all the lower grounds of this town were ſo filled with loggs, that many of the inhabitants got the greateſt part of their yearly proviſion of firewood there; all the vegitables were burned up by the ſalt water, which was by the violence of the wind, carried over the town, ſo as at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of half a mile, it was ſeen to fall like rain; all the lower floors of the houſes were covered with water, but no houſes were hurt except one, which ſtood at the water ſide, in which lived a joiner, a ſchooner drove upon it, and they alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately deſtroyed each other; but the greateſt fury of it was ſpent on the neighbourhood of the Paſca Oocolo river; the plantation of Mr. Krebs there was almoſt totally deſtroyed, of a fine crop of rice, and a large one of corn were ſcarcely left any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, the houſes were left uncovered, his ſmith's ſhop was almoſt all waſhed away, all his works and out houſes blown down; and for thirty miles up a branch of this river which (on account of the abundance of that ſpecies of cypreſs<note n="*" place="bottom">Cupreſſus Thyoides.</note> vulgarly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led white cedar) is called cedar river, there was ſcarce a tree left ſtanding, the pines were blown down or broke, and thoſe which had not intirely yielded to this violence, were ſo twiſted, that they might be compared to ropes; at Botereaux's cow pen, the people were above ſix weeks conſulting on a method of finding and bringing home their cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; twelve miles up the river, live ſome Germans who, ſeeing the water riſe with ſo incredible a rapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, were almoſt embarked, fearing an univerſal flood, but the water not riſing over their land,

they did not proceed on their intended journey to the Chactaw nation. At Yoani, in this nation, i am told the effects were perceivable; in all this tract of coaſt and country the wind had ranged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſouth ſouth eaſt and eaſt, but farther weſt its fury was between the north north eaſt and eaſt, a ſchooner belonging to the government having a detachment of the ſixteenth regiment on board, was drove by accident to the weſtward as far as Cat Iſland, where ſhe lay at an anchor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the weſt point, the water roſe ſo high, that when ſhe parted her cables, ſhe floated over the iſland, the wind north by eaſt, or thereabout ſhe was forced upon the Free maſons iſlands, and lay about 6 weeks before ſhe was got off, and if they had not accidentally been diſcovered by a hunting boat, the people might have remained there and died for want, particularly as water failed them already when diſcovered; the effect of this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent direction of the current of air or wind was here ſurpriſing, the ſouth eaſterly wind having drove the water in immenſe quantities up all the rivers, bays, and ſounds to the weſtward, being here counteracted by the northerly wind, this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of water was violently forced into the bay of Spirito Santo at the back of the Chandeleurs, grand Gozier, and Breton Iſles, and not finding ſufficient vent up the rigolets, nor down the outlets of the bay, it forced a number of very deep chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels through theſe iſlands, cutting them into a great number of ſmall iſlands. The high iſland of the Chandeleur had all the ſurface of its ground waſhed off, and i really think, had not the clay been held faſt by the roots of the black man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grove, and in ſome places the myrtle (Myrica)
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:014440_0021_0F92655BE38A1178"/>
there would have been ſcarce a veſtige of the iſland left; at the mouth of Miſſiſippi all the ſhipping was drove into the marſhes; a Spaniſh brig foundered and parted, and a large crew was loſt, ſome of the people were taken from a piece of her at ſea, by a ſloop from Penſacola a few days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; in the lakes at Chef Menteur, and in the paſſes of the rigolets, the water roſe prodigiouſly and covered the low iſlands there two feet; at St. John's Creek, and New Orleans, the tide was thought extraordinary high, but at all theſe laſt places there was no wind felt, being a fine ſerene day with a ſmall air from the eaſtward.</p>
               <p>The moſt extraordinary effect of this hurricane was the production of a ſecond crop of leaves and fruit on all the mulberry trees in this country, a circumſtance into which i very carefully enquired, but could not learn from the oldeſt and moſt curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous obſervers that this had ever happened before; this tardy tree budded, foliated, bloſſomed, and bore ripe fruit with the amazing rapidity of only four weeks time immediately after the guſt, and no other trees were thus affected.</p>
               <p>The ſouth and ſouth weſt winds make a thick heavy air, and are in my opinion hurtful to the lungs; they alſo occaſion the ſultry weather, ſo much complained of in July and Auguſt. The winds from the eaſtern quarter every where be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tween the ſouth eaſt and the north eaſt, are cool and moiſt, and they cauſe the frequent ſhowers, by which the very ſand of this climate is endued with ſo prodigious a vegetative power that it amazes every one. The winds from the eaſt to the north are agreeably cool, and from the north to the north weſt, occaſion what is here called cold weather; i

have frequently kept thermometrical journals, but have none left now for inſpection.</p>
               <p>I remember the general height of the mercury on Fahrenheit's ſcale, to have been, in the ſhade where the air was not prevented circulating freely about it, between 84° and 88° and on ſome ſultry hot days in July and Auguſt, i have known it to riſe up to 94°, when at the ſame time by carrying it out and expoſing it to the ſun, it will riſe in a very ſhort time up to 114°, nor can i remember ever to have ſeen it above one or two degrees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the freezing point; it is impoſſible for one to imagine how inexpreſſibly temperate the weather is here from the latter end of September to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of June; the weſtern part of this northern diviſion is not ſo very hot in ſummer, as the whole eaſtern ſhore of the Peninſula is, but its ſea ſhore is much more expoſed to the bleak winter winds.</p>
               <p>In the ſouthern diviſion i have never ſeen the mercury in Fahrenheit's thermometer below the temperate point, and i cannot remember ever to have ſeen it higher than in the northern diviſion.</p>
               <p>This ſouthern part of the Peninſula is in the months of May, June, July, and Auguſt very ſubject, on its weſt ſide, to dreadful ſqualls, and there is a certainty of one or more of theſe tornadoes every day, when during that ſeaſon, the wind comes any where between the ſouth ſouth eaſt, and ſouth weſt, but they are of very ſhort duration; then alſo thunder and lightning is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, but nothing near ſo violent as in Caroli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na and Georgia, nor do i remember any more than one inſtance of damage occaſioned by it, when it made a large hole in a ſtone wall of a houſe at St. Auguſtine; yet very few electrical conductors are made uſe of there.</p>

               <p>Haloes, or as they are vulgarly called circles round the ſun and moon, are very often ſeen, and are ſure forerunners of rain if not wind ſtorms; thoſe of the ſun are leſs frequent, but they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways followed by very violent gales of wind; it is remarkable, that if in thoſe haloes a break is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that break is always towards the quarter, from whence the wind begins; water ſpouts are often ſeen along this coaſt, but i cannot learn that

they ever occaſioned any miſchief, nor could i learn, that earthquakes have ever been experienced in this part of the world.</p>
               <p>Of Weſt Florida, there needs ſcarce any thing more to be ſaid, with regad to the article of climate, or air, than what i have ſaid of my northern diviſion of Eaſt Florida, it agreeing in every reſpect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, except that the winter is ſomething more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, it often killing tender fruit trees; <note n="*" place="bottom">In 1771-2, it killed apple and pear trees.</note> however, as the ſickneſs of 1765 at Mobile, has been a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of much diſcourſe, and as it has been ſet up (by people who would if poſſible prevent the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation of ſo fine a country) as a ſcarecrow to ſuch, as are eaſily deceived by appearances, and never enquire deeper than external ſhews; this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal diſorder has been followed by the entire ruin of Mobile, and had nearly ſpoiled the reputation of Penſacola, which though ſituate in as fine, airy, dry and healthy a ſite as any on the continent, and at leaſt at a diſtance of ſixty miles from Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile, had yet the misfortune to be confounded with it, and to be thought liable to the ſame miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes; i will give as faithful an account of that illneſs, as has come within the verge of my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>Mobile was originally built by the French, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had left their old Fort Condè, thirty miles higher up the Tombecbé, having found that ſituation very inconvenient; they now made at leaſt as injudicious a choice in another reſpect, by placing themſelves at a diſtance from good water, on low ground, and directly oppoſite to ſome marſhy iſlands, at the diviſion between the ſalt and freſh water, a ſituation well known in America not to be eligible for the ſake of health, but the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:014440_0025_0F92655F72640258"/>
convenience of the navigation up to it being the beſt in their poſſeſſion at that time, its being a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier againſt the Spaniards, and the eaſy communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with the Chactaw and Upper Creek nations, as well as with the Miſſiſſippi, made people forget the evils attending it, and it ſoon became, from a fort, a pretty town, with ſome very good houſes built in no inelegant taſte, yet the French inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants duly obſerving the inconveniencies of this unhealthy ſpot, adapted their conſtitutions to it, by a regular ſober life, being uncommonly care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to get their drinking water from a rivulet at the diſtance of three miles, where it is very good, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they give into exceſs of drinking ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liquors and wine, and at the ſeaſon, when the continued heat cauſed a putrefaction of the water in pools, and exhaled the moiſture of this low ground, thereby filling the air with noxious vapours, and thus occaſioning the acute epidemical diſorders (that proved ſo fatal in the year 1765) thoſe pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent inhabitants retired to their plantations up or down the river, ſome even at a ſmall diſtance, there to enjoy a freer circulation of a leſs putrified air, thus alſo by the depopulation of the town, the remaining inhabitants ſuffered leſs by being leſs crowded together, and there were ſuch inſtances of longevity here as are not to be outdone in any part of America. Let me beg leave to mention among many others, one more commonly known, it is the Chevalier de Lucere's family, who are now all very old, and whoſe mother not many years ſince died by breaking one of her legs, that had been ſo much calcarizated by the gout, that it ſnapped by ſtepping into bed, ſhe died aged far above one hundred years.

more familiar to me, which is that of one Mr. François, who lives now about five miles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the river Poule: In September 1771, i cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led there, the old man told me he was then paſt eighty three years of age, that the old woman, whom i ſaw putting bread into the oven, was his mother; and that ſhe was one of the firſt women that came from France to this country; i ſaw her about her domeſtick buſineſs in many ways; in a very cheerful manner, ſinging and running from place to place as briſkly as a girl of twenty; Mr. François told me, that at the age of ſixty he fell out of a pine tree, above fifty feet high, with his loins over a fallen one, that he with difficulty recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that had it not been for that accident, he would not, as he thinks, yet have been ſenſible of the heavy hand of time; that he was ſtill a hearty cheerful old man, was evidently to be ſeen; when i came to the river Poule in October 1772, i met the ſame old gentleman fiſhing at the mouth of the river, on my aſking him whether this diverſion was agreeable to him, he told me; that his mother had an inclination to eat fiſh, and he was come to get her a meſs; he was then on foot and had five miles to come to this place, and as much back with his prey, after catching it; a very dutiful ſon this at eighty five! He lives comfortably at an agreeable place, and on the produce of a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling large ſtock of cattle.</p>
               <p>Many more of this kind might be mentioned, but theſe two being more univerſally known, i choſe to relate them only.

               <p>It is an almoſt invariable rule for people, who intend going to a different climate, to conſult ſome friend or acquaintance on the manner of life, he would adviſe him to lead, i have never yet heard of one going to Florida, who was not told by his friend, that a free glaſs was neceſſary; how true this is, i ſhall not pretend to ſay, but certain it is, that the advice is almoſt always too freely followed, the free glaſs generally degenerating in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a glaſs of exceſs.</p>

               <p>The night air is not ſo much to be dreaded here, as in countries where the ſun is vertical, or nearly ſo, and conſequently, by its long abſence, makes a chilling penetrating night follow a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day, but here it is not long enough abſent to cool the atmoſphere ſufficiently to hurt the unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſleeper, who during the firſt heat of a ſultry night perhaps has expoſed his open pores to the mercy of the air.</p>
               <p>The atmoſphere is, during this ſeaſon, ſo burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hot, that undoubtedly very ſudden rarefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the humours are often experienced, which cauſe ſuch abundant perſpiration, that water, as ſoon as drank, penetrates the open pores, ſo that the human ſkin ſeems to be comparable to a wet ſpunge when ſqueezed; yet although the water is here very cool (and if it has not this quality natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, it is artificially made to acquire it) we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hear of the fatal effects of water drinking, ſo often experienced in the cities of New York and Philadelphia, the reaſon perhaps is, that it is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom if ever drank unmixed.</p>
               <p>I will however venture to foretell, that on open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the woods of this country for cultivation, which will naturally drain ponds, gullies, &amp;c. the air will be here very little affected by thoſe perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious vapours, which have ſo uncommon an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence over the humours and fibrous parts of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man frame, as to deſtroy their harmonious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordance

               <p>If we conſider the effects of heat and humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on the hardeſt ſubſtances, ſuch as wood, and even metals, which are thereby expanded, and have the union of their ſolid parts relaxed, it may give us an idea, how much more their effects muſt be felt in the animal oeconomy at times, when fire and water unite their diſſolving powers to act on all nature.</p>
               <p>A very dry hot air, though leſs dangerous to the body, than a hot moiſt one, has yet very near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſame effects, as it partially dries the Ponds, Marſhes, Swamps, &amp;c. leaving the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining water and mud to exhale, and ſpread their noxious vapours through the atmoſphere.</p>
               <p>Every inhabitant of any part of America knows, that the ſudden tranſitions from cold to heat ſo prevalent on that continent, are much more to be dreaded, than any of the above named cauſes of immoderate heat, cold, moiſture, and drought.</p>
               <p>I am now to conſider the nature and appearance of the earth, which in this part of America, may be divided into ſix different ſorts, much the ſame as in Carolina, with this diſtinction, that it is much more unequally divided.</p>
               <p>I ſhall treat of them by the names of pine land, Hammock land, ſavannahs, ſwamps, marſhes, and bay, or cypreſs galls.</p>
               <p>Firſt the pine land, commonly called pine bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, which makes up the largeſt body by far, the Peninſula being ſcarce any thing elſe; but about an hundred miles towards the north weſt from St.

Auguſtine, and about two hundred from the ſea in Weſt Florida, carry us intirely out of it. This land conſiſts of a grey, or white ſand, and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places of a red or yellow gravel; it produces a great variety of ſhrubs or plants, of which i ſhall hereafter deſcribe ſome, the principal produce from whence it derives its name is the <hi>pinus foliis longiſſimis ex una theca ternis,</hi> or yellow pine and pitch pine tree, which i take to be a variety of the ſame ſpecies, both excellent and good timber.</p>
               <p>Alſo the <hi>chamoerops frondibus palmatis plicatis ſtipitibus ſerratis,</hi> of whoſe fruit all animals are very fond.</p>

In wet weather the roads leading through them are almoſt impaſſable.

The other ſavannahs differ very widely from theſe, and are chiefly to be found in Weſt Florida, they conſiſt of a high ground often with ſmall gentle riſings in them, ſome are of a vaſt extent, and on the weſt of Miſſiſſippi, they are ſaid to be many days jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney over, the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="24" facs="unknown:014440_0038_0F92656C358DD6C0"/>
they might more luxuriously feed. In theſe ſavan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nahs if a well or pond is dug, the water has a very ſtrong nitrous taſte. I have ſeen ſome very curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous plants in this kind of ground, but there was no time for my examining any of them, except a nondeſcript of the genus <hi>Tagetes</hi> of a fine crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon colour. I ſhall in ſome meaſure deſcribe and give the figure of this plant. The only high growth i have ſeen in theſe ſavannahs are ſome willows and other aquatic plants, by the ſide of rivulets, in or near them; ſome of the ſmaller kind of oaks and a few ſmall <hi>junipers</hi> are alſo to be ſeen in thoſe places, the <hi>fragaria</hi> or ſtrawberry is very common in them.</p>
               <p>Swamps are alſo found of two kinds, river and inland ſwamps, thoſe on the rivers are juſtly eſteemed the moſt valuable, and the more ſo, if they are in the tide way, becauſe then the river water may be at pleaſure let on or kept out, with much leſs labour and expence than in the other kinds; theſe lands are the ſources of riches in theſe provinces, becauſe where they lay between the ſandy pine barrens, they produce that valuable ſtaple Rice, and on the Miſſiſſippi (where much of this river land is ſituated a great deal higher, than the common run of it in Carolina, and other ſimilar countries) this ſoil is the beſt adapted for corn and indigo, yet known; ſome of theſe grounds are clay, others ſand, and others again partake of both; when uſed for rice, it matters not which of theſe ſoils they are made up of, but I believe, were the ſandy ones to be quite drained, they would prove barren enough; the uſe of water on rice is more to ſuppreſs the growth of noxious weeds and graſs, which would otherwiſe ſtifle the grain, than for promoting the growth of the rice itſelf, for none
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:014440_0039_0F92656CF2090D30"/>
of the graſſes can ſtand the water, but rice does, as long as it is not totally immerſed, therefore it is, that after weeding, the planter (if he has it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient) lets on water to about half the height of his grain; by ſwamps then in general is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood any low ground ſubject to inundations, diſtinguiſhed from marſhes, in having a large growth of timber, and much underwood, canes, reeds, wythes, vines, briars and ſuch like, ſo matted together, that they are in a great meaſure impenetrable to man or beaſt; the produce of theſe ſwamps if ſandy is more generally the cypreſs tree, which is here of three ſpecies; two of theſe grow in this kind of land; the common ſort grows to an enormous ſize, but none ſo large, as what is ſeen on or near the banks of the Miſſiſſippi, the other kind vulgarly miſcalled white cedar, is in great quantities near Penſacola, particularly in the ſwamps of Cheſter River; this likewiſe grows to a tree which may be ranked among thoſe of the firſt magnitude: If theſe ſwamps are not altogether ſand, but mixed with clay, and other earth, their produce is in general.</p>

               <p>The back or inland ſwamps anſwer in ſituation to what are called the meadows or ſavannahs (among the pine lands) their ſoil being rich, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions them to bear trees. The true back ſwamps, that are in wet ſeaſons full of ſtanding water, bear ſcarcely any other tree, than a variety of that ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Nyſſa diſtinguiſhed by Botaniſts by the name of <hi>Nyſſa foliis latis acuminatis non dentatis fruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu aeleagni minore, pedunculis multiflore,</hi> vulgarly called bottle arſed tupelo; the continuance of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on this kind of ground, is the reaſon why ſcarce any undergrowth is found here. There are ſwamps alſo called back ſwamps, but they are either at the head of ſome ſtream, or have more or leſs wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter running through them; theſe are generally eaſy to drain. I would have confined my deſcription of back ſwamps to the firſt or ſtanding ones, and rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the laſt (which i think might properly be done) among the river ſwamps, but i was apprehenſive, that it might have diſpleaſed ſome perſon, who entertains the more eſtabliſhed opinion; theſe laſt deſcribed often are found meer cypreſs ſwamps, in that caſe, they are almoſt impaſſable, by reaſon
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:014440_0044_0F926575717C0B88"/>
of the cypreſs ſpurs, even when dry, and for horſes, they are extremely dangerous, as they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten get ſtaked on thoſe ſpurs. This vegetable monſter i ſhall hereafter deſcribe; i do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to have ever ſeen it mentioned any where; when this kind of ſwamp is not over grown with cypreſs alone, its product is the ſame as that of the river ſwamps above mentioned, and in that caſe the ſoil is certainly good; theſe laſt when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly drained, are the beſt land for the cultivation of hemp.</p>
               <p>The marſhes are next to be conſidered, they are of four kinds, two in the ſalt, and two in the freſh water; they are either ſoft or hard, the ſoft marſhes conſiſting of a very wet clay or mud, are as yet of no uſe, without a very great expence to drain them; the hard ones are made up of a kind of marly clay, which in dry ſeaſons is almoſt burned up, true it is they afford a paſture ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to keep any gramenivorous animals in good order; but the milk and fleſh of them in ſeaſons, when the cattle near the ſea ſide cannot find any other food, and conſequently feed on this alone, are of ſo horrible a taſte, that no ſtranger to the country can make uſe of them. Hard marſhes in general are ſuch, whoſe ſoil has too much ſolidity, for the water to diſunite its particles by penetrating them; the ſoft marſhes are thoſe, whoſe ſpungy nature allows the water eaſily to penetrate them; i have ſeen of both kinds on Turtle River, about twenty miles up, in which, at about eight or ten feet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſurface, there are numbers of cypreſs and other ſtumps remaining, but chiefly cypreſs, and many of the fallen trees croſſing each other; this is only to be ſeen at low water, and to the height

above named; theſe trees are covered with a rich nitrous muddy ſoil; but i beg leave to expect, that better Naturaliſts may explain this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary appearance; i believe them ruins of ancient foreſts on which the ſea has encroached. <note n="*" place="bottom">The whole appearance of this river ſeems to indicate ſuch an ancient and unrecorded hurricane on this part of the coaſt.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The marſhes on freſh water are in every reſpect ſimilar to thoſe on the ſalt, except, that they are not impregnated with the ſaline particles, of which the firſt are very replete; therefore the hard ones, with little trouble, are adapted to cultivatïon; the ſoft ones coſt a conſiderable deal more of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, to render them fit to anſwer this purpoſe, but when ſo drained as to anſwer this end, they certainly are by no means inferior to any land in this country; in the lower part of theſe marſhes grows a kind of hitherto undeſcribed grain, of which the weſtern Indians make a great uſe for bread, i never could ſee it in bloſſom, therefore, cannot deſcribe it, but joined to this is a figure of it, nearly equal in ſize to one eighth of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon growth of the plant when in perfection, it is known by the name of wild oats.</p>
               <p>This kind of land produces rice very willingly, but if ſufficiently made dry, always proves the beſt for corn, indigo and hemp; i have ſeen at Mr. Brewington's plantation, about three miles below ſavannah in Georgia, very good corn and rice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, with the two kinds of melons, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbers in great perfection on this ſpecies of ſoil.</p>
               <p>I ſhall next deſcribe the bay and cypreſs galls; theſe interſect the pine lands, and are ſeldom of any breadth; the bay galls are properly water courſes, covered with a ſpungy earth mixed with
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:014440_0047_0F92657916BEA990"/>
a kind of matted vegetable fibres; they are ſo very unſtable, as to ſhake for a great extent round a perſon, who, ſtanding on ſome part thereof, moves himſelf ſlightly up and down; they often prove fatal to cattle, and ſometimes i have been detained for above an hour at the narroweſt paſſes of them, they being ſo dangerous to croſs, that frequently a horſe plunges in, ſo as to leave only his head in ſight; their natural produce is a ſtately tree called loblolly bay, <note n="*" place="bottom">Hyperium, ſeu G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The cypreſs galls differ from theſe, in being a firm ſandy ſoil, in having no vitriolic taſte in the

water, and very ſeldom vent; i never knew theſe made uſe of for the purpoſe of planting, and the cypreſs they produce, is a dwarf kind, not fit for uſe, being very much twiſted and often hollow, there is no undergrowth here, but in dry ſeaſons ſome tolerable graſs. Through all the above ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of land we find a diſtribution of very fine clay, fit for manufacturing; the fineſt i ever ſaw is at the village on Mobile Bay, where i have ſeen the inhabitants, in imitation of the Savages, have ſeveral rough made veſſels thereof; there is alſo a great variety of nitrous and bituminous earths, foſſills, marles, boles, magnetic and other iron ore, lead, coal, chalk, ſlate, free ſtone, chryſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and white topazes, theſe laſt in the beds of rivers; ambergris is ſometimes found; one Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup a few years ago found a piece of a very enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſize on one of the keys; there is alſo much of a natural pitch or <hi>aſphalthus,</hi> vulgarly called <hi>mungiac,</hi> thrown up by the ſea: The uplands alſo afford a metallic ſubſtance appearing like muſket bullets, which on being thrown into the fire go off in ſmoak with a very ſulphureous ſtench.</p>
               <p>The water in this country is very various as to taſte, quality and uſe, there are ſalt, brackiſh, ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, ſulphureous, and good freſh ſprings in moſt parts of this country, as well as ſalt and freſh lakes, lagoons and rivers, the rivers alſo vary in many reſpects, and ſo does the ſea as well in the colour, and clearneſs of the water as in its degree of ſaltneſs; the water of St. Mary's and Naſſau, and all the brooks that run into them is very good, wholeſome, and well taſted, the colour in the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers is dark, as in all the American rivers of the
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:014440_0049_0F92657A6ACE38B0"/>
ſouthern diſtrict; St. John's is a curioſity among ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers indeed, this riſes at a ſmall diſtance from the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goon called Indian river, ſomewhere in or near the latitude of 27, perhaps out of the lake Mayacco, which i have reaſon to believe really exiſts, and is the head of the river St. Lucia, as i am told by a credible Spaniſh hunter, who had been carried there by way of this laſt river; from its origin it runs through wide extended plains and marſhes, till near the latitude 28, where it approaches the lagoon much, it then continues its courſe with a conſiderable current northward, and glides thro' five great lakes, of which the laſt, called Lake George, is by much the moſt conſiderable; in this laſt lake is about eight feet water, it is twenty miles long and about eleven or twelve wide; all theſe lakes and the river in general is very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant; endleſs orange groves are found here, and indeed on every part of the river; below theſe the river grows wider, loſes it current, and has in ſome places none, in others a retrograde one, when yet lower down it is again in its true direction; the banks of this river are very poor land. and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit in a number of places ſad monuments of the folly and extravagant ideas of the firſt European adventurers and ſchemers, and the villany of their managers; the tide does not effect this river very far up. In many places high up this river are found ſome extraordinary ſprings, which at a ſmall diſtance from the river on both ſides, ruſh or boil out of the earth, at once becoming navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable for boats, and from twenty five to forty yards wide, their courſe is ſeldom half a mile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they meet the river; their water is (contrary to that of the river) clear, ſo as to admit of the

ſeeing a ſmall piece of money at the depth of ten feet or more; they ſmell ſtrong of ſulphur, and whatever is thrown in them becomes ſoon incruſted with a white fungous matter; their taſte is bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous, very diſagreeable, and they in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion cauſe the green cloudings we ſee on the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the water of this river, and make it putrid, and ſo unwholeſome as experience has taught us it is. I have no ſufficient ground to decide upon another circumſtance, which i am told, viz: That when rice is overflown with this river water, it kills it; above theſe ſprings the water of the river is good: This river is from one and a half to three miles wide, except at the houſe of Mr. Rolle, who has here made an odd attempt towards ſettling and making an eſtate in as complete a ſandy deſart as can be found; juſt above this, it is full of iſlands, exhibiting every where a very romantic appearance; there is a fine piece of water, called Dun's Lake, this is about nine miles from the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, eaſtward from this place, this empties itſelf by a ſtream into the river; another called the Doctor's Lake, is on the weſt ſide, about ſixty miles from the mouth, we ſee a variety of aquatic plants floating thereon. In my journey by land from the Bay of Tampe acroſs the Peninſula to St. Auguſtine, i croſſed twenty three miles from eaſt to weſt of miſerable barren ſand hills, the grain of the ſand is very ſmall and ferrugineous; theſe hills riſe a conſiderable height; on them is ſome growth of very ſmall pines, and a very humble kind of oak grows ſo thick, that with the addition of ſome wythes and other plants, to me ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unknown, they render it abſolutely impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrable. in this Ridge, which, as far as i can

learn, extends from North to South, between the rivers St. John and <hi>Ocklaw-wawhaw,</hi> for about an hundred and fifty miles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> having no where any water in its whole extent, and i am told, that where we croſſed it, is its narroweſt place; my Indian guide had the precaution to carry water for ourſelves and horſes, which proved very ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable as it was a verv hot day, no growth of trees to ſhade us, and ſuch a burning ſand for the ſun to reflect on; i leave the reader to judge what we ſuffered, though it was but a ſhort diſtance over, both ourſelves and beaſts often experienced the neceſſity of carrying water; what muſt travelling over this place be in a hot day, where it is forty or more miles wide?</p>
               <p>Before i leave St. John's River, i muſt not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the river running from ſouth to north, called Pablo: This originates at a ſmall diſtance from St. Marks or North River, and empties into St. Johns at a ſmall diſtance from the mouth. The water of this river is good, ſo is the land on it; and it is thought that a communication with St. Mark's or the North River might be effected without much difficulty: this would open an inland navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation by canoes or boats, all the way from Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolina to near the Muſketo.</p>
               <p>The river St. Mary although it is ſaid to origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in the <hi>Aehanphanaekin</hi> ſwamp has a current of fine clear and wholeſome water ſupplied from the pine lands through which it flows, with many fine ſprings, runs, and rivulets of very clear water, Naſſau has alſo the ſame bleſſings, but doth not ſpring far diſtant from the ſea. On Amelia Iſland near the ſea, is a very good ſpring, which makes a fine ſtream for ſome miles, dividing the iſland al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:014440_0052_0F92657CAB2931C0"/>
into two; but below the ſpring its water is not commendable. On the beach betwen St. John's and St. Auguſtine, at or near a place called the Horſeguards, there are three good ſprings running into the ſea, and in every part where the beach is clear ſand, water is obtained by digging. About four miles north of St. Auguſtine riſes St. Sebaſtian's Creek, being a good freſh ſpring, it ſoon joins a creek in ſalt marſhes, and at a ſmall diſtance from town it becomes very large and deep; it empties into St. Anaſtaſia's Sound two miles ſouth of St. Auguſtine, making a Peninſula of this territory nearly in form of a creſcent; three miles farther ſouth is the mouth of the river St. Nicholas not very conſiderable; St. Cecilia in the ſame ſound, the North weſt, ſouth of the Matanca and Penon; the Tomoke and Spruce Creek in the Muſketo Lagoon, and in ſhort every river and creek in the country except thoſe above named, are excellent wholeſome water; thus much i ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe will ſuffice as to the nature and quality of the water. All the rivers and ſprings in Weſt Florida are good.</p>
               <p>The aborigines of the country come moſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally under our next conſideration, no one is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that the epithet of indians is given to thoſe people, though no doubt, the French name of ſavage is a much more proper one, as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the red men are in every reſpect ſuch as betray that diſpoſition, and ſhew the ſavage thro' the beſt wrought veil of civilization; we might call them Americans, as the inhabitants of the old world are each diſtinguiſhed by a name expreſſive of, or relative to the quarters, from which they reſpectively originate, but this would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding

               <p>Oldmixon with all his failings is undoubtedly the only writer, who ſpeaks with truth and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence on this ſubject; all other Engliſh, French, and Spaniſh authors, which have fallen in my way (and they are not a few) have made of this ſtory a confuſed heap of nonſenſe and falſhood; i ſhall relate what i know and have found from real ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience among four or five nations, and as i can vouch for the ſimilarity, that will be found among them, i believe my reader will be of my opinion, that from one end of America to the other, the red people are the ſame nation and draw their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin from a different ſource, than either Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Chineſe, Negroes, Moors, Indians, or any other different ſpecies of the human genus, of which i think there are many ſpecies, as well as among moſt other animals, and that they are not a variety occaſioned by a commixture of any of the above ſpecies muſt alſo appear.</p>
               <p>The above account will perhaps raiſe a conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that i believe the red men are not come from the weſtward out of the eaſt of Aſia; i do not believe it, i am firmly of opinion, that God cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated an original man and woman in this part of the globe, of different ſpecies from any in the other parts, and if per chance in the Ruſſian do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, there are a people of ſimilar make and manners, is it not more natural to think they were colonies from the numerous nations on the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent of America, than to imagine, that from the ſmall comparative number of thoſe Ruſſian ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, ſuch a vaſt country ſhould have been ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merouſly
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:014440_0054_0F92658196F03910"/>
peopled, and by what we know from the geographical diſcoveries that have been made within this century, it was undoubtedly eaſier for theſe people to have croſſed out of America into Aſia, than it was for the white people we find in Labrador to come from Lapland, yet who will deny that a Laplander and <hi>Eſkimaux</hi> are of the ſame original ſtock; add to this, that i have both ſacred and prophane hiſtory, beſides daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience on my ſide to prove, that population, as well as all other things we find in nature, have always moved from the eaſtward, and ſtill continue ſo to do, why then ſhould we inſiſt on one part of this ſyſtem to move in a retrograde way, when for a further proof we find, by what we learn from the ſavages that have been far to the northweſt, that ſome white people anſwering to the Japoneſe, ſometimes come on that coaſt, but do not ſtay, nor have ever attempted colonization.</p>
               <p>But alas! what a people do we find them, a people not only rude and uncultivated, but inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of civilization: a people that would think themſelves degraded in the loweſt degree, were they to imitate us in any reſpect whatever, and that look down on us and all our manners with the higheſt contempt: and of whom experience has taught us, that on the leaſt opportunity they will return like the dog to his vomit. See there the boaſted, the admired ſtate of nature, in which theſe brutes enjoy and paſs their time here! How juſtly did the above named author exclaim:— <q>Let the learned ſay all the fine things that wit, eloquence, and art can inſpire them with, of the ſimplicity of pure nature, and its beauty and innocence, the ſavage wretches of America
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:014440_0055_0F926583241D1248"/>
are an inſtance, that this innocence is a downright ſtupidity, and this pretended beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a deformity, which puts man, the Lord of the creation, on an equal foot (yea below) the brute beaſts of the fields and foreſts.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In deſcribing a people an hiſtorian is obliged to ſpeak as they generally are; Dr. Blackwell, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſequences from what he imagined a ſtate of nature to be (and what i believe it may have been) among moſt of the nations on the old con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, ſays:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>In the infancy of ſtates, men generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the publick conſtitution, they have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that turn, which the rough culture of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, perhaps diſmal enough, through which they have paſſed, could give them, they are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and undeſigning, governed by fear, and ſuperſtition its companion; there is a vaſt void in their minds, they know not what will happen, nor according to what tenor things will take their courſe, every new object finds them unprepared, and they gaze and ſtare like infants taking in their firſt ideas of light.</q>
               </p>
               <p>How oppoſite is the ſavage, he is cunning and deſigning, knows no fear, nor has he any idea of religion to make him ſuperſtitious, on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the pretended conjurer who lives with him, runs a perpetual riſque of his life, he has no void in his mind, but is very deliberate and careful in his miſchief and cruelty; the ſtudy of what may occur in the next war or hunting ſeaſon always employs him, he can ever ſo plan his ſchemes, as to be certain of his future ſafety, and ſucceſs; without this laſt he neither undertakes nor riſks any thing; new objects are but a momentary ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:014440_0056_0F9265839C7B13A0"/>
to him, and his gazing and ſtaring always end in ſovereign contempt.</p>
               <p>But to demonſtrate more clearly the contraſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a ſavage and the people of the old conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, i beg leave to obſerve a few things, which have fallen under my inſpection and conſideration, which i apprehend will be thought pertinent to this purpoſe: A ſavage comes into this world with all the poſſibility of oppoſition to us; his mother on her approaching labour, retires from all company, aid, or aſſiſtance, into ſome lone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome wood, and there without perceptible pain or inconvenience, diſburthens herſelf, goes into cold water to cleanſe herſelf and her offspring, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to her daily vocation.</p>
               <p>A ſavage has the moſt determined reſolution againſt labouring or tilling the ground, the ſlave his wife muſt do that, and a boy of ſeven or eight years old is aſhamed to be ſeen in his mother's company. No greater diſtance can be thrown on a man than calling him by the odious epithet of Woman; what other nation do we find ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neglecting agriculture? What people are aſhamed to be ſeen eating or drinking in company with the fairer ſex?</p>
               <p>Our women carry their children with their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces towards their own, a ſhe ſavage puts the back of hers towards her own back. When we make fire, we pile the fuel parrallel to each other; the ſavage puts his wood in a circular form, lights the central ends, and by the help of one of the ſticks, which he ſhoves always to the center, he keeps it in.</p>
               <p>We make war in an open brave way, a ſavage by hiding himſelf ſurprizes; our priſoners are ſure
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:014440_0057_0F92658433769F20"/>
of life, the priſoner of a ſavage is ſure to die by cruel tortures. When we take a ſweat, we keep ourſelves warm with the utmoſt care; a ſavage with his open pores, plunges head long into the almoſt frozen river, or into a hole in the ice if quite frozen.</p>
               <p>A ſavage man diſcharges his urine in a ſitting poſture, and a ſavage woman ſtanding, i need not tell how oppoſite this is to our common prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</p>
               <p>A ſavage never eats ſalted meats, nor boils any thing in ſalted water, though he has ſalt in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, but when he has been a long while from ſalt and then gets it, he will frequently eat a pound of it without any thing elſe. A ſavage ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther buries none of his dead, or if he does he puts the body in a ſitting or ſtanding poſture; in a word, if they had always ſtudied to be in contraſt with us, they could not be more ſo, than nature has made them.</p>
               <q>O Deus! homines et homines creaviſti.</q>
               <p>All ſavages, with whom i have been acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are, generally ſpeaking, well made, of a good ſtature, and neatly limbed; crooked, lame, or otherwiſe deformed perſons are ſeldom or never ſeen among theſe people; and if per chance we find a ſavage labouring under theſe misfortunes, we always find them accidental, never natural. Their colour reſembles that of cinnamon, with a copperiſh caſt; they are born white, but retain that hue a very ſhort time; their hair is lank, ſtrong, black, and long; they prevent the growth of what little beard nature has given them, by plucking it out by the roots; they never ſuffer any hair to grow on any part of the body except
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:014440_0058_0F926584F2EFC3B0"/>
the head, their eyes are black, lively and pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and they are bleſſed with an amazing faculty of diſcovering objects at a vaſt diſtance; their teeth are very good, and to the laſt they retain them, being never ſubject to the tooth ach; they are ſtrong and active, patient in hunger and the fatigue of hunting and journeying, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient and incapable of bearing labour, they are incredibly ſwift of foot; their diſcourſe is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of war, hunting, or indecency; their wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are handſome, well made, only wanting the colour and cleanlineſs of our ladies, to make them appear lovely in every eye; their ſtrength is great, and they labour hard, carrying very heavy burdens a great diſtance; they are laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and have no idea of chaſtity in a girl, but in married women, incontinence is ſeverely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; a ſavage never forgives that crime. They are capable of an attachment, rather than a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; addicted to lying in a high degree; their ſeeming candour and ſimplicity is an effect of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation; they know how to ſave appearances, and will always find ways to cover their knaviſh, thieving tricks; their notions of faith and honour are ſuch as make them violate their word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, even when they are in treaty, unleſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to be true by fear or force. They are bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and have not the moſt diſtant idea of decorum; without taſte they are terrible drunkards, in which laſt ſtate, there is no villany new crime, they will not commit, and when they recover their ſenſes, throw the blame on the liquor, holding themſelves entirely excuſed; no religion of any kind can we trace among them. Poſſeſſed of indifference and want of ſentiment, they drag themſelves through
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:014440_0059_0F926585AC6B2B88"/>
a kind of life, which would make us paſs our days very irkſomely, and tire us in a ſhort time with the diſagreeable ſimilitude of our hours; in a word, they have nothing in their way of life to tempt a man of the leaſt reflection, to envy them their miſerable ſtate of nature.</p>
               <p>But with all theſe bad qualities, they have one virtue, which is hoſpitality, and this they carry to exceſs; a ſavage will ſhare his laſt ounce of meat with a viſitant ſtranger. What travellers have related of their giving their daughters to tranſient perſons, is not true, and it is not till after ſome acquaintance, that they will give a white man, what they call a wife, unleſs he chooſes an aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned proſtitute, which are here to be found as well as elſewhere. Among the nations, which i have frequented, a young ſtranger (led away by the notion of this traveller's ſtory) that would attempt, on his firſt acquaintance, to aſk a man for his daughter, might pay dear for it. The Chactaws, who have a greater idea of a <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum</hi> than any of their neighbours, are not ſo hoſpitable as they; but although they will on this principle require pay for even the leaſt morſel, they ſet before one, yet the ſame idea of proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty has taken off much of their ſavage diſpoſitions in many other caſes.</p>
               <p>I cannot think it foreign to my ſubject to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, before i proceed to the particular deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of each nation, ſomething farther about the origin of the native Americans: Great pains have been taken to prove theſe people deſcended from the <hi>Phaenicians;</hi> among others i find an ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous Gentleman, who gravely tells us, that <hi>Phaenicians</hi> or <hi>Erythreans</hi> in Greek, carry the ſame
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:014440_0060_0F92658684E47100"/>
ſenſe as <hi>Eſau</hi> or <hi>Edom</hi> in Hebrew, both meaning red, hence that nation was red, ſo are the ſava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ergo, they are the ſame people; as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous as this argument is, the pains taken to ſhew that the extenſive navigation of the <hi>Phaenicians</hi> amounts to a proof of their having croſſed rhe Atlantic to America, is no leſs void of ſenſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though far fetched annotations are made uſe of to prove their naval power, by <hi>Cambyſes</hi> being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to renounce his deſign on <hi>Carthage,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the <hi>Phaenicians</hi> refuſing to put to ſea, yet neither that, nor the proof of their having built <hi>Leptis, Utica, Hippo, Adrumetum,</hi> on the African continent, nor <hi>Calis,</hi> and <hi>Tarteſſus</hi> in Europe, or their colonizations in <hi>Iberia,</hi> and <hi>Lybia,</hi> nor all the power aſcribed to them by <hi>Curtius,</hi> ſeems in the leaſt to indicate any tranſit to this weſtern world.</p>
               <p>Equally abſurd are the reveries of <hi>Comtaeus,</hi> of thoſe who conſtrue the iſland diſcovered by the Phaenicians (which <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> mentions L. 6 C. 7, and the paſſages of <hi>Pliny</hi> L. 5 C. 1 and <hi>Pomponius Mela</hi> L. 1 C. 4) likewiſe the common wealth of the alegorical dialogue between <hi>Midas</hi> and <hi>Silenus</hi> by <hi>Theopompus,</hi> and the quotation of <hi>Pauſanias</hi> concerning the diſcovery of the <hi>Satyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> by <hi>Euphemius</hi> of <hi>Caria</hi>) into America; alſo <hi>Boſſu</hi> father <hi>Laffiteau, du Pratz,</hi> and others, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of theſe would be unintereſting and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tedious, i ſhall content myſelf with having only mentioned them, and proceed to take ſome notice of the more general hypotheſis; <hi>that the ſavages are the diſperſions of the ten loſt tribes of Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are told, that the Americans agree in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their cuſtoms with the Jews; but in which?
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:014440_0061_0F926588833B7420"/>
We ſee not the ſmalleſt ſimilarity in any of their ways, unleſs the ſeperation of women among the Chicaſaws, at the time of their <hi>Catamenia;</hi> but not to urge how naturally this faſhion might point itſelf out, and its being confined to one ſmall tribe only, let us argue a little on the jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh grand and characteriſtic ceremony of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, of which the boldeſt genealogiſt in this way, cannot find any the leaſt mark, nor traces among thoſe people. How have the jews ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected to introduce this ſign of the covenant here, when they have made it obtain among ſo many of the Eaſterns where they lived even as ſlaves and exiles; and they always thought their ſalvation dependent thereon? How many tribes in Africa ſtill retain that cuſtom, though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other of the Iſralitiſh rites, which they have forgot? but where can we diſcover even the moſt diſtant appearance of this ceremony in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica?</p>
               <p>Juſt ſo is it with that pretended migration to <hi>Aſſareth,</hi> as mentioned in the fourth book of <hi>Eſdras,</hi> in the thirteenth chapter; but without inſiſting on the apocryphal quality of this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, i would only aſk, why this <hi>Aſſareth</hi> ſhould be more America, than any other far diſtant country? And how they found their way by the <hi>Euphrates</hi> to this continent? Further it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that <hi>St. Jerome</hi> (who flouriſhed under <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoſius</hi> in the latter end of the fourth century, lived in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and held a cloſe correſpondence with the Jews, for the ſake of learning their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage) plainly tells us in his <hi>Ezech:</hi> L. 5, and <hi>Jerem:</hi> L. 6, that thoſe very ten tribes, were then groaning under the ſevere yoke of ſlavery, in the
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:014440_0062_0F926588C348E588"/>
cities of <hi>Media</hi> and <hi>Perſia;</hi> this i judge to be proof enough to invalidate this journey to <hi>Aſſareth,</hi> and rank it along with the fables of the loſs of the whole law, the confinement of ſouls in ſubterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous apartments, and with the childiſh tales of <hi>Behemoth</hi> and <hi>Leviathan</hi> in the ſame fourth book of <hi>Eſdras.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet, as a farther proof of the falſhood of this American expedition, by the ten tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> i would beg leave to aſk my readers, whether they can imagine, that ſo prodigious a migration could poſſibly happen at a time of the moſt deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate wars, and deſolations in the very countries through which they muſt neceſſarily paſs, for it is evident, that ſince <hi>St. Jerome</hi>'s time, although the <hi>Perſians</hi> had again regained their empire, yet for ſeveral centuries together, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly warring with the <hi>Romans, Indians,</hi> and other Eaſtern nations, and laſtly with the <hi>Saracens.</hi> 'Till the famous Tartarian expedition under <hi>Zen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis Chan,</hi> this whole country ſwam in the blood of its natives, and before this period, the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an wars, the conqueſts of <hi>Alexander,</hi> with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of his captains at his death, furniſhed as little opportunity for this journey, which alſo muſt have been ſtrangely overlooked, by ſuch a number of hiſtorians of credit, as flouriſhed dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the above ſpace of time. I could with as much force of argument invalidate <hi>Emanuel de Moras</hi> (a Spaniard;) who, to prove that Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca is peopled from <hi>Carthage,</hi> and by the Jews, makes numerous far fetched compariſons, of the manners of theſe nations and the <hi>Brazilians;</hi> nor can i think, that after this, any of the favourers of this Jewiſh anceſtry will inſiſt, that the natives
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:014440_0063_0F92658990B972C8"/>
of America are deſcended from the other two tribes, ſince they were not only not allowed to ſee the land of their fathers, even in quality of travellers, but on pain of death, were they forbid to aſſemble in large companies, which it was however ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary they ſhould do for ſuch a migration; but i am afraid my reader, as well as myſelf, is by this time tired of ſo much argumentation againſt ſo ſilly an Hypotheſis.</p>
               <p>No leſs idle is the argument uſed by Grotius concerning the Mexicans telling the Spaniards, that they came out of the North, where he thinks to find the Norwegian deſcent in the city <hi>Norum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bega,</hi> but who can find in North America, traces of any ancient city at all? That the Americans divide their time by nights (or ſleeps, as they ſtile them) is true, alſo their dipping new born infants in cold water, their going naked, and their eating ſeparate from the women, with many other cuſtoms of the ſavages, ſimilar to the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent manners of the Germans, but this only proves to me, that in the times of <hi>Tacitus</hi> and the other <hi>Roman</hi> hiſtorians, the <hi>Teutonick</hi> nations were in as ſavage a ſtate of nature, as we now ſee the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans; a ſameneſs in colour, and ſtature, as well as, or rather than ſimilarity of Languages is to me a requiſite proof, and for that reaſon i believe, that the <hi>Eſkimaux</hi> came from <hi>Lapland,</hi> but by what accident, we are ignorant of, and ſo we might gueſs at ſome eventual paſſage of the red ſavages, were we able to trace any ſimilarity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and any nation of the old world, but we ſee none; yet all the iſlands of America, even <hi>New Zealand,</hi> are peopled by the ſame race as this vaſt continent; therefore i will rather ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:014440_0064_0F92658AA30ABBD0"/>
that the ſavages, have ſent out colonies, than that they are a colony from any other part of the earth. The ſame Gentleman endeavours to fetch the <hi>Peruvians</hi> from <hi>China,</hi> but with as little foundation in truth. Mr. Powell's ſtory of Maddock the Welſhman's voyage, cannot be thought fit, to aſcribe a Welſh origin to the ſava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, becauſe they could by no means either grow to ſuch numbers, nor degenerate ſo much in colour, as they muſt have done, in two centuries; yet even this has been made uſe of by a certain Dutch writer, whoſe name i do not now recollect; and how unluckily does <hi>Boſſu</hi> here bring forth the black headed <hi>Pinguin,</hi> to prove that the Welſh word <hi>Pen-gwin,</hi> was given to this bird for a name, by Maddock's followers, becauſe <hi>Pen</hi> is head, and <hi>gwyn</hi> is white, and Mr. Foſter in his note on that paſſage, is as unlucky in ſaying <hi>Penguin</hi> is Spaniſh for a fat bird.</p>
               <p>I find a more powerful argument uſed by thoſe who bring the ſavages from <hi>Tartary;</hi> becauſe i do not at all doubt, from my judgment of geography, that <hi>America</hi> joins <hi>Aſia;</hi> but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition of <hi>Hoccota,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Canguiſta,</hi> firſt King of the Tartars, as mentioned by <hi>Michalon Lituanus,</hi> in his <hi>Ennead</hi> 9, L. 6, which has like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe been conſtrued to have reached America, is alſo too late to allow them time to become ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous a people; becauſe this man lived about the year 1240; but although i believe a poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the paſſage by land, yet i cannot find, that there is any ſimilarity in the perſons of the North Eaſtern Tarters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the American ſavages, and much leſs in their manners; and if there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe of <hi>Kamſchatka</hi> and America, i ſtill
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:014440_0065_0F92658AEDDE9D60"/>
think, that the firſt are more naturally to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a ſmall colony from the latter, than that the latter prodigious numerous people are ſprung from ſo ſmall a tribe as the <hi>Kamſchatkans;</hi> every one of the red men over the whole continent, and thoſe who ſtill remain in a few of the iſlands, is exactly ſimilar in perſon to his neighbour, and their numbers are to this day vaſtly great, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the cruel depredations of the ſeveral European nations,</p>
               <p>The contemptible light, in which <hi>Boſſu</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to place the number of the ſavages, is well confuted by Mr. Hutchin's account of the nations near our ſettlements, who having mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally deſtroyed each other, and been deſtroyed by the ſword, and liquid fire of the Europeans, at a ſhocking rate, yet amount by that Gentleman's moderate calculation, even at this day, to near three hundred thouſand ſouls; therefore it is not their ſmall number, but the vaſt extent of this continent, that cauſes their nomadic life.</p>
               <p>But to treat more particularly againſt this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of the American deſcent from the Tartars, who can ſuppoſe that their darling animal, as well for food, labour, and war, as other uſes, i mean the horſe, ſhould not have been brought along with the colony? Who knows not, that the Tartars uſe moſt, and can leaſt ſpare this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creature? Does not all their martial power conſiſt in horſemen? Does not their very main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance depend on horſes? Have we not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent proof, that many Tartarian Lords keep hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of horſes, and even ſtable them? None are ſo poor as not to have two or three; when they ſhift their abode, do not horſes carry
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:014440_0066_0F92658BB3A93C28"/>
their tents and proviſions? When all other food fails them, garlick and mare's milk is their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource; the very blood out of the veins of theſe animals ſupplies the place of an agreeable drink; what ſtream ſo rapid which they do not croſs on their horſes backs, or by holding their manes, and guiding them with a twig, while they ſwim at their ſide? making a ſmall raft of their bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, they tie it to the tail, and thus croſs every river in their way; a horſe's ſkin makes a boat to croſs a very wide river, lake, or even an arm of the ſea; the ſuppoſed narrow diviſion between Aſia and America, near Cape <hi>Tchukſhi,</hi> could then by no means, be an obſtacle to the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of theſe animals the diviſion of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places, named by <hi>Boſſu,</hi> through earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, is abſurdly introduced, to prove that this migration happened before ſuch a convulſion of nature, which prevented the return of any of theſe emigrants. A Tartarian army ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears larger than it is, on account of each man having two or three horſes; and notwithſtanding their horſes die by the ſword, or are killed for food, yet many thouſands are yearly delivered to <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> by the European Tartars only; this much premiſed, how had the ſavages no horſes on the arrival of the Spaniards? Had the Tartars in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited a country near America, the very horſes would have increaſed ſo as to come over to this continent; how many inſtances do we find even among the ſettled provinces of America, of horſes going wild! but the greateſt proof, that this muſt have infallibly happened, is to be found in South America, where now many millions are found wild, in the great plains ſouth of Brazil,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:014440_0067_0F92658CA1CB94B0"/>
eſpecially near <hi>Rio de la Plata;</hi> yet theſe take their origin from the Northern America, and have croſſed vaſt mountains; how came it then, that a dozen or two of horſemen routed myriads of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans? only one objection remains to be confuted; there may be an arm of the ſea between Aſia and America, and this colony came by water; but can it even then be ſuppoſed, that theſe people would have forgot their favourite horſes? or will any ſay that if the horſes could come by land, yet every climate does not maintain them; one ſummer would ſuffice for the journey: A horſe when traveling alone, is experienced to go very faſt forward on his journey, and we learn alſo from the ſame great teacher (experience) that thouſands of horſes in North America, even breeding mares, live in the woods in deep ſnows, through hard winters, without human aſſiſtance; but no, theſe Tartars could not bring horſes, nor other uſeful animals, and yet a colony of Panthers, Lynxes, Wolves, Foxes, Otters, and other deſtructive animals muſt be ſuppoſed to have found their way as well as theſe emigrants. Here language is tortured into a proof; a certain <hi>Abraham a Mylis</hi> has found out, that in the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of <hi>Cathay,</hi> which lays neareſt America, they ſpeak the <hi>Teutonic</hi> dialect, and this ſame empire being divided, into ſeven provinces, the Eaſtermoſt is called <hi>Tendhuk,</hi> very like to <hi>het eynde des hoeks,</hi> or the end of the point, and <hi>Anyan</hi> is very like, <hi>Aangang,</hi> or paſſage (a paſſage to be ſure out of Tartary, to America;) again beyond <hi>Anyan,</hi> is the vaſt country of <hi>Bergo,</hi> this certainly is very much like <hi>Bergen,</hi> or ſheltering, becauſe the <hi>Scythians</hi> leaving their native country, ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered

themſelves here; fine Etymology! noble Geography! <hi>(riſum teneatis amici!)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The paſſage from Aſia to America, is by no means proved by the pretended Elephants bones found in the ſwamp near Ohio, ſince by later ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, and examinations of the bones, by men of more knowledge than the meer vulgar, they appear never to have belonged to elephants, but more probably are the remains of ſome <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>popotami,</hi> eſpecially as near that river, the Indians, often at this day, diſcover large foot ſteps, and hear great bellowings, both proceeding from ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals they never ſee themſelves.</p>
               <p>I think if Mr. <hi>Boſſu</hi> had obliged us with the knowledge of the particular nation that calls the <hi>Ginſeng,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Panax Quinquefolium</note> 
                  <hi>Gareloguen,</hi> he would have thrown more light on his far fetched notion of the parallel between the Tartars and Savages; and ſince he has himſelf invalidated the pretended etymology, i would beg leave to deal with his ſimilar ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations in the ſame manner, for why ſhould not the ſame idea ſtrike <hi>Boſſus's</hi> nation and the <hi>Mant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheoux</hi> Tartars upon ſight of the <hi>Ginſeng,</hi> and make both compare it to men's thighs? But as but one nation among ſo many has accepted this idea, it cannot be allowed, even as the moſt diſtant proof; the fable of the <hi>Eſcaaniba</hi> by Boſſu alſo, is too ridiculous and abſurd to merit confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>Nothing now remains, but a few words about the migration of the <hi>Chineſe</hi> into <hi>Peru,</hi> from whence ſome ſuppoſe America is peopled, but how different the colour and figure of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple! and where do we find any <hi>Chineſe</hi> fineſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſavages? beſides, what Geographer
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:014440_0069_0F92658FA8A2D8E8"/>
does not know that the <hi>Chineſe</hi> might more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily, have come over to the eaſtern ſhore of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, acroſs the Atlantic, than over the wilder, wider, and more ſtormy South Sea, to land on <hi>Perus's</hi> or <hi>Chilis's</hi> unhoſpitable ſhore, where our large European veſſels can ſcarcely live, much leſs a <hi>Chineſe</hi> junk; nor did the <hi>Peruvians</hi> know any thing of large Veſſels till the arrival of the Spaniards; ſtrange indeed, that their naval knowledge, and mother country, ſhould be thus forgotten! the more ſo, as it is much eaſier, to go from America to <hi>China,</hi> than the contrary, by reaſon of the conſtant eaſterly winds reigning here, which alſo make it more improbable that the <hi>Chineſe</hi> veſſels came here by chance, or ſtreſs of weather; nor could they in that caſe, but by chance, be provided with the proviſions neceſſary for ſo long a voyage.</p>
               <p>Methinks i hear ſome critical perſon ſay, whence then came the ſavages? That indeed, is a difficult queſtion to anſwer; it is eaſier to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the different opinions, than to ſay any thing with certainty on this head, more eſpecially as theſe people want all manner of record; yet a tolerable gueſs may be made to extricate us out of this difficult labyrinth.</p>
               <p>Without doubt <hi>Moſes</hi>'s account of the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is true, but why ſhould this Hiſtorian's books, in this one thing, be taken ſo univerſally, when he evidently has confined himſelf to a kind of chronicle concerning one ſmall part of the earth, and in this to one nation only; this account therefore muſt be underſtood with the ſame limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation as many others in holy writ are generally allowed to be; i think therefore that (as menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:014440_0070_0F9265902A1E0F08"/>
before) we do not at all derogate from God's greatneſs, nor in any ways diſhonour the ſacred evidence given us by his ſervants, when we think, that there were as many <hi>Adams</hi> and <hi>Eves</hi> (every body knows theſe names to have an alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorical ſenſe) as we find different ſpecies of the human genus; is this not a more natural way, agreeing more with the proceedings of a God of order, than the ſilly ſuppoſitions that the variety is an effect of chance, much leſs a conſequence of curſes? the more ſo, as neither has any foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in God's holy word; why muſt we think that the curſes of a head of a family, ſhould ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect each race with a peculiar ſet of features, and ſhape of body? Or one tribe with a red, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond with a ſallow, a third with a yellow, and a fourth with a black colour, &amp;c? Beſides we read of but one curſe of this kind; they are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſpecies then. Anatomy has taught us, that the bone of a Negroe's ſkull, is always black, that beſides the <hi>Tunies</hi> of which our ſkins are compoſed, they have an additional one, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of numerous veſicles, filled wish a black ink-like humour; ſee here then two character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſticks, beſides the blackneſs of the ſkin, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by this ſable race is diſtinguiſhed; may not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teach us, that when the other ſpecies are more carefully examined, they will all be found to have ſome ſuch peculiar character of diſtinction? Why then ſhall we involve our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into numberleſs, needleſs difficulties about the origin of theſe ſo ſingular people, ſo very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from all other tribes on the globe, yet ſo very ſimilar to each other: Throughout their own continent their wild manners are univerſally
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:014440_0071_0F926590F04A1B38"/>
alike; their languages only differ; why then can we not take the more eaſy way in ſaying, God has created an original pair here as well as elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: Is not this opinion ſupported by our finding numberleſs other kinds of the animal kingdom on this continent peculiar to itſelf; where (beſides in America) do we find the <hi>Bos Americanus?</hi> Where the <hi>Paca,</hi> and <hi>Vecunha</hi> (both American ſheep?) where the <hi>Urſus Luſcus</hi> or racoon, the <hi>Armadillo,</hi> the <hi>Agouti,</hi> the <hi>Lacerta Americana,</hi> called <hi>Leguana?</hi> the <hi>Ignavo</hi> (an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal called the American Sloth?) where the ſame kind of <hi>Simiae,</hi> and the <hi>Veſpertilio Cynoce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalus?</hi> where the <hi>Warri</hi> or the <hi>Pecaire</hi> (two ſpecies of the <hi>Sus?</hi>) The many kinds of <hi>Myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mecophaga,</hi> the <hi>Mus Marſupialis, Mus Scalopes, Mus Paluſtris hiſpidus,</hi> of the ſame kind, as thoſe in America? Where again the <hi>Struthio Americanus,</hi> or the immenſe variety of the <hi>Pſittacus,</hi> peculiar to America? Where the <hi>Toucan,</hi> the <hi>Phaenicop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teros</hi> and <hi>Arquato,</hi> with the red <hi>Platea?</hi> Where the beautiful wood duck, and the kinds of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſianus</hi> called <hi>Quama</hi> and <hi>Curaſoa?</hi> Where the little <hi>Melliſuga,</hi> or the beautiful, and remarkable aquatic <hi>Muſcophagus,</hi> called a ſun bird? and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more of the quadruped and winged tribes, large and ſmall, too tedious to enumerate? Where again the rattle Snake, and others of the reptile kind? Even among Fiſhes, the ſame obſervation holds; has <hi>Pliny</hi> among all his fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous animals, deſcribed any like theſe really ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting ones?</p>
               <p>Again, whence was America ſtocked with men in our likeneſs? Where were the oxen, the horſes, the ſwine, dogs, cats, or even rats? or
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:014440_0072_0F926591ED24A400"/>
where were our poultry to be found on this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent? Yet we ſee how immenſely they have multiplied ſince their firſt importation, ſo that the air and food are certainly well adapted to them; a wiſe effect of providence, which knew this quarter muſt one day become inhabited by animals not originally created in it.</p>
               <p>What can now be ſaid againſt this my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a ſeparate origin of the ſavages? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that will amount to an abſolute proof of the contrary. But a difficulty ariſes as to the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the deluge; to remove which i muſt obſerve, that America, even in its mountains, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains very few if any of the ſo often quoted marks of this inundation; on the contrary, it is a ſmooth regularly riſing country; and i think, that to believe the flood ſo far partial, as to have reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the only lands of <hi>Egypt, Paleſtine, Armenia,</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> is by no means an abſurd opinion, nor inconſiſtent with the deſtruction of the race of men of which <hi>Moſes</hi> treats, nor with the water being fifteen cubits above the higheſt hill then known, ſuppoſed to be <hi>Arrarat;</hi> and had it been abſolutely univerſal, yet the <hi>Andes, Cordileras, Aceytas,</hi> and <hi>Santa Martha,</hi> are many hundred cubits higher and conſequently, might remain a vaſt way dry; but grant the deluge univerſal, who will diſpute with me, that the omnipotent Lord of the univerſe could create a red man after his own image, ſuffer him to fall as well as a white man, deſtroy his poſterity except a few, and find a way to ſave a remnant of man and beaſt, and then for reaſons, into which we have no right to enter, any more than the clay has to contend with the potter, leave this race without
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:014440_0073_0F9265929398BD28"/>
extending his tender mercies to them, as he did to us, not even ſending his apoſtles into this quarter of the world; and when the chriſtians, ſo called, arrived here firſt, to ſuffer the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Miſſionaries to preach a falſe, abſurd doctrine to thoſe wretches, nay, even to this day to harden their hearts againſt the light drawn from under a buſhel, and placed conſpicuouſly on a candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick.</p>
               <p>However among none of the ſavages do we find any tradition of ſuch a flood, except among ſome ſouthern nations, who tell of ſix perſons creeping out of a hole, whereby the earth was peopled; theſe have been conſtrued into <hi>Noah</hi>'s ſons and their wives.</p>
               <p>The Chactaws have told me of a hole between their nation and the Chicaſaws, out of which their whole very numerous nation walked forth at once, without ſo much as warning any neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; i cannot find any relation between this and a deluge: On the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> of <hi>Darien</hi> i have indeed been warned by the ſavages of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching flood on a certain day, and when i had ſtayed till then and ſaw the event to be nothing, i ridiculed them about it; and they told me that a great while ago they had ſuch an inundation, and that their <hi>Sukies</hi> or conjurors, had foretold a ſimilar one now, but had proved themſelves ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars; this is the only hint i could ever trace of any notion of a great flood; and i leave my reader to judge of the weakneſs or force of this evidence, and of the juſtneſs of the opinion advanced, which i offer only becauſe i think that truth ſhould be the object of man's enquiries, and that God has given us the only advantage we

have over brutes, in order to ſpur us on to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries into the myſteries of nature.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now treat of the four moſt noted nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons connected with Florida in particular, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with the Chicaſaws, they being (although a ſmall tribe) accounted the mother nation on this part of the continent, and their language, univerſally adopted by moſt, if not all the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern nations. This is the moſt fierce, cruel, inſolent, and haughty people, among the ſouthern nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; they are very intrepid in the wars with their Meridional neighbours, and the French under Meſſrs. <hi>Artaguette</hi> and <hi>Bienville,</hi> in 1736 expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced their valour (when aided by a few En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhmen of tried courage) and in 1752, and 1753, Meſſrs. <hi>Benoiſt</hi> and <hi>Reggio</hi> likewiſe found them ſucceſsful to their coſt; but with the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern nations it ſtands otherways; the <hi>Kikapoos, Piancashas</hi> and others are their terror; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their boaſt of ſcalps from the northward, it has appeared that, except ſome private murders among nations, who think the inſult to come from ſome other quarter, and ſome ſlaves and ſcalps obtained from the daſtardly <hi>Chigtagiks,</hi> they have really not been able ſo much as to find the <hi>Kika<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poos, Piancasha, Wyogtani, Shogteys, Muſquakey, Otogami</hi> towns; this appeared clearly while i was in the Chicaſaw nation in the winter of 1771 and 1772, when one Mr. James (who had been a priſoner with the <hi>Kikapoos,</hi> for the ſpace of three years, and had found means to eſcape from them) arrived there, and told, that in all that time ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver one of the Chicaſaws appeared, or did miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief among theſe nations, nor could he learn they ever did; yet it is evident that theſe come
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:014440_0076_0F9265977A94EAF0"/>
to the very Chicaſaw towns to commit depredati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as well as in their hunting grounds, where the Chicaſaws always take care to fortify them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>It is alſo obſervable, that to the north of their towns they never venture any plantations, and to the ſouthward they have many; nay they ſcarcely venture to get fire wood north of their habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; in ſhort they have never ſhewn their brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry but againſt the Chactaws and Creeks, with the French their allies; the Northerns have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been their maſters, and the <hi>Arkanſas</hi> and <hi>Catawbas</hi> their match; the <hi>Cherokees</hi> have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally had the worſt of the wars between them; they have always been ſtaunch allies to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, but i think there is no very great dependance to be had on them now, for i can (not without reaſon) affirm, that that alliance was all owing to the French being their irreconcilable, and mortal enemies; now theſe are out of the way, little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance is to be had on them; and in the winter of 1771 and 1772, the traders were under daily apprehenſions of a quarrel. It is true that thoſe monſters in human form, the very ſcum and out caſt of the earth, are always more prone to ſavage barbarity than the ſavages themſelves; but it is no leſs true, that the traders were of as diſſolute a life, and of as profligate manners, with as great an inclination for deceit and over reaching during the French time, as they are now; but then the policy of theſe ſavages curbed their thoughts of revenge; whereas now they frequently dare to vent threats of a diſagreeable nature, which are the more dangerous becauſe thoſe ſavage politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are always very much upon their guard when
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:014440_0077_0F926597AEF69928"/>
they are treating with our men in office, how they behave themſelves in this reſpect, well knowing that the ancient fame of their faithful alliance is ſufficiently rooted in the hearts of the open minded Engliſh, to enable them to impoſe on their credulity.</p>
               <p>As an inſtance of Chicaſaw honour or faith, which is indeed equal to that of any nation of American ſavages whatever; i would mention the tryal that has been made for concluding an union between the <hi>Arkanſas, Quappas,</hi> or <hi>Kappas,</hi> and the Chicaſaws; the firſt attempted at leaſt an alliance with the latter ſo long ago as 1764, but no kind of ſolemn embaſſy, or deputation was employed for the effecting this before the ſummer 1771, and then at this meeting the inſolence of the Chicaſaws run ſo high, as to inſult one of the <hi>Quapa</hi> deputies by calling him a woman, and ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting rum in his face, which was put up with; but the <hi>Arkanſas</hi> never have made an attempt to finiſh the treaty ſince, and i dare venture to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, that ſuch an union would by no means be for our good, let it happen when it may.</p>
               <p>The morals of this nation are more corrupt than thoſe of any of their neighbours; the Chac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taws are ſaid to be thieves, but i can aſſure the reader that the Chicaſaws are a thouſand times more ſo; i have had ample proof of it by loſing incomparably more in one day at the Chicaſaw town than i did in two months going through ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty four Chactaw towns, notwithſtanding i had been warned, and was on my guard againſt the Chicaſaws; my razors and a caſe of inſtruments, and other trifles of no real uſe to them, beſides every horſe i had with me, vaniſhed in one day
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:014440_0078_0F9265990D3A1008"/>
among theſe deceitful people. Their diſcourſe is really intolerable, nothing but filth is heard from them; the vanity of being accounted great hunters and warriors has the better of every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and rather than condeſcend to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the earth (which they think beneath them) they will ſit and toy with their women; or if they ſend them to labour, they play on an auk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward kind of flute made of a cane, lolling thus their time away with great indifference, which obliges them yearly to apply for corn and pulſe to the Chactaws.</p>
               <p>They live nearly in the center of a very large and ſomewhat uneven ſavannah, of a diameter of above three miles; this ſavannah at all times has but a barren look, the earth is very Nitrous, and the ſavages get their water out of holes or wells dug near the town; in any drought the ground will gape infiſſures of about ſix or ſeven inches wide, and again, two or three days rain will cauſe an inundation; the water is always ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, and this field abounds, with flint, marl, and thoſe kinds of anomilous foſſils miſtaken for oyſter ſhells, which cannot be burnt into lime; yet this produces a graſs of which cattle are ſo fond as to leave the richeſt cane brakes for it; and notwithſtanding the ſoil appears barren and burnt up, they thrive to admiration; it alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords a vaſt, or even immenſe ſtore of the ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious <hi>Fragaria,</hi> vulgarly known by the name of wood ſtrawberry.</p>
               <p>They have in this field what might be called one town, or rather an aſſemblage of hutts, of the length of about one mile and a half, and very narrow and irregular; this however they
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:014440_0079_0F926599433D8F30"/>
divide into ſeven, by the names of <hi>Melattaw</hi> (i. e.) hat and feather, <hi>Chatelaw</hi> (i. e.) copper town, <hi>Chukafalaya</hi> (i. e.) long town, <hi>Hikihaw</hi> (i. e.) ſtand ſtill, <hi>Chucaliſſa</hi> (i. e.) great town, <hi>Tuckahaw</hi> (i. e.) a certain weed, and <hi>Aſhuck hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> (i. e.) red graſs; this was formerly incloſed in paliſadoes, and thus well fortified againſt the attacks of ſmall arms, but now it lays open; a ſecond <hi>Artaguette,</hi> a little more prudent than the firſt, would now find them an eaſy prey.</p>
               <p>The neareſt running water, is about one mile and a half off, to the ſouth of the town, in the edge of the field, but it is of no note; the next is four miles off; and at high times, canoes might come up here out of the river <hi>Tombechbé;</hi> this place is a ford, which often proves difficult, and on this account is called <hi>Nahoola Inalchubba</hi> (i. e.) the white mens hard labour.</p>
               <p>Horſes and cattle thrive well in this nation, their breed of the former was once famous, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from ſome Arabian horſes brought from Spain to Mexico, but of late they have ſo mixed them with meaner kinds, as to cauſe them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate much.</p>
               <p>The traders who for fear of cauſing jealouſy by their diſcourſe have formed nick names for all the ſavage nations, have called theſe by the whimſical name of the breed; as cunningly ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious as the ſavages are, yet i never found that any of them ever took notice of this diſtinction.</p>
               <p>One remarkable thing i cannot omit of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: There were in 1771, only two real origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Chicaſaws left; one of them, who goes by the name of <hi>North Weſt,</hi> ſcruples not to tell them all very often, that they are of a ſlave race.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="unknown:014440_0080_0F92659A012EB430"/>Their grand Chief is called <hi>Opaya Mataha,</hi> and it is ſaid he has killed his man upwards of forty times, for which great feats he has been raiſed to this nominal dignity, which by all ſavages is as much regarded, as among us a titular nobleman would be if he ſhould be obliged to be a journey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man taylor for his maintenance.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſavages are the only ones i ever heard of who make their females obſerve a ſeparation at the time of their <hi>Menſes</hi> (ſome ancient almoſt extirpated tribes to the northward only excepted, and theſe uſed to avoid their own dwelling houſes) the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men then retire into a ſmall hut ſet apart for that purpoſe, of which there are from two to ſix round each habitation, and by them called moon houſes.</p>
               <p>The whole tribe are remarkably ſtrong made fellows, but few of their women have regular features, or deſerve to be called handſome; theſe labour vaſtly hard, either in the field for culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of corn, or fetching nuts, fire wood and water, which they chiefly carry on their backs; the two firſt articles generally two or three miles, and the laſt often a mile, their burthens would amaze a ſtranger, being rather fit for aſſes than women to carry.</p>
               <p>This nation is the moſt imperious in their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage towards their women, of any i have met with; they are very jealous of their wives, and adultery in them is puniſhed by the loſs of the tip of the noſe, which they ſometimes cut, but more generally bite off, but this does not deter them, for they are a very ſalacious race, and the mark is pretty general. They are all good ſwimmers, notwithſtanding they live ſo far from waters, but
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:014440_0081_0F92659AFA2C70D8"/>
they learn their children to ſwim in clay holes, that are filled in wet ſeaſons by rain.</p>
               <p>They are the moſt expert of any perhaps in America in tracking what they are in purſuit of, and they will follow their flying enemy, on a long gallop, over any kind of ground without miſtaking.</p>
               <p>Since i am on this ſubject, i cannot forbear taking notice of one thing related by many wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters on America; which is the knowledge the ſavages have by the track of what kind of people they purſue; this is very true, and this ſagaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous particular deſerved admiration, but the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der muſt ceaſe when i tell my reader, that i have found in it much of a juggle, for inſtead of knowing it by the foot ſteps (which they pretend to meaſure very ceremoniouſly with their hands) they know it by the ſtrokes of the hatchets in the trees and branches as they go along, which no two ſavage nations agree in, be it in the height from the ground, or in the ſlope of the cut; they can alſo diſtinguiſh the different ways of making camps and fires; for inſtance; a Chactaw war camp is circular, with a fire in the center, and each man has a crutched branch at his head to hang his powder and ſhot upon, and to ſet his gun againſt, and the feet of all to the fire; a Cherokee war camp is a long line of fire, againſt which they alſo lay their feet; a Chactaw makes his camp in travelling in form of a ſugar loaf; a Chicaſaw makes it in form of our arbours; a Creek like to our ſheds, or piazzas, to a timber houſe; in this manner every nation has ſome diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way.</p>
               <p>The Chicaſaws are eſteemed good hunters, they
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:014440_0082_0F92659B8E6082F0"/>
have extenſive hunting grounds and make excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent uſe of them; they extend them to the branch of the <hi>Ohio,</hi> called <hi>Tanaſſé, Hogoheechee</hi> or <hi>Cherokee</hi> ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and claim to the mouth of the <hi>Ohio,</hi> but this ground they frequent with great caution, only in the depth of winter when their northern enemies are cloſe at home; they are often ſurpriſed on the rivers <hi>Margot</hi> and <hi>Yaſoo,</hi> but below the <hi>Yaſoo</hi> as far eaſt as the eaſtern branches of <hi>Tombechbè,</hi> and as low as <hi>Oka Tibehaw,</hi> they hunt ſafely; this laſt they regard as their boundary with the Chactaws, but theſe two nations are by no means jealous of each other in this reſpect, and hunt in each others grounds without lett or hindrance from either ſide; although their country abounds in beaver, they kill none, leaving that to the white men; they think this kind of hunting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath them, ſaying any body can kill beaver, but men only deer; this is exactly the reverſe of a northern Indian; they hunt like all their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours with the ſkin and frontal bone of a deer's head, dried and ſtretched on elaſtic chips; the horns they ſcoup out very curiouſly, employing ſo much patience on this, that ſuch a head and antlers often do not exceed ten or twelve ounces; they fix this on the left hand, and imitating the motions of the deer in ſight, they decoy them within ſure ſhot. I cannot forbear to mention a merry accident on this occaſion; a Chactaw In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, who was hunting with one of theſe decoys on his fiſt, ſaw a deer, and thinking to bring it to him, imitated the deer's motions of feeding and looking round in a very natural way, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſavage within ſhot, miſtaking the head for a real one, ſhot the ball through it, ſcarcely miſſing
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:014440_0083_0F92659C30133870"/>
the fingers of the firſt; the affair ended in fifty cuffs, but was no farther reſented.</p>
               <p>Their habitations at home conſiſt of three buildings, a ſummer houſe, a corn houſe, and a winter houſe, called a hot houſe; the two firſt are oblong ſquares, the latter is circular, they have no chimnies but let the ſmoke find its way out through a hole at the top in their dwelling houſes, but in the hot houſes, where it can; in theſe they make large wood fires, on the middle of the floor, which being by evening all coals, they enter in, and ſleep on benches made round the inſide of the building; this would ſtifle any one not uſed to it, and be it never ſo ſharp a morning, they come out ſweating and naked as ſoon as it is day; i believe this proceeding kills numbers of them, as in lattitude 35 00, where they live, it is often very cold; they alſo uſe for an univerſal cure of all diſeaſes, exceſſive ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in theſe hot houſes, and then with their pores open jump into a hole of cold water, this treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe that had the ſmall pox killed num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; theſe hot houſes of a morning emitting ſmoke through every crevice, ſeem to a ſtranger to be all on fire on the inſide.</p>
               <p>Their common food is the <hi>zea</hi> or the Indian corn, of which they make meal, and boil it; they alſo parch it, and then pound it; thus tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it on their journey, they mix it with cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and will travel a great way without any other food; they begin to have the knowledge of keeping cattle; but at preſent they enjoy little or no freſh meats while at home, but in the hunting ſeaſon in the woods, it is almoſt the only food they make uſe of; they have alſo a way of dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:014440_0084_0F92659D1AF9A7A8"/>
and pounding their corn, before it comes to maturity; this they call <hi>Boota Copaſſa</hi> (i. e.) cold flour; this, in ſmall quantities, thrown into cold water, boils and ſwells as much as common meal boiled over a fire; it is hearty food, and being ſweet, they are fond of it; but as the proceſs for making it is troubleſome, their lazineſs ſeldom allows them to have it; they likewiſe uſe hickory nuts in plenty, and make a milkey liquor of them, which they call milk of nuts; the proceſs is at bottom the ſame as what we uſe to make milk of almonds; this milk they are very fond of, and eat it with ſweet potatoes in it; they alſo make a great uſe of Bears fat as oil; the fleſh the traders have learned them to make into ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, exactly reſembling that of a hog; but all theſe diſhes ſuit but ill the palate of an European, and when they have any deer or buffalo fleſh at home, it is ſo dried as to have no taſte in it.</p>
               <p>The knowledge they have of cattle keeping is borrowed from the traders among them, who, notwithſtanding the ordinance againſt ſettling on Indian grounds, have many of them plantations, and raiſe cattle and hogs; one Caldwell has the greateſt ſtock; and <hi>Opaya Mingo Luxi</hi> went in 1771 to complain of it, but Caldwell, knowing that no ſavage can withſtand the words of a white man, took advantage thereof, and ſo intimidated the ſavage, by his meer preſence at Penſacola, when in the ſuperintendant's hall, in order to lodge his information, and make his complaint that <hi>Opaya Mingo Luxi</hi> himſelf ſaid he had nothing againſt him; but as the very Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary has a plantation and cattle, and keeps negroes &amp;c. for the cultivation thereof (though
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:014440_0085_0F92659DB2738318"/>
he keeps his cattle under the name of <hi>Opaya Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taha</hi>) i think very little will be done to hinder it; and upon the whole, i think the affair of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the ſavages, who muſt ſoon ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally give into this way of life for their own preſervation, or elſe remove further from us.</p>
               <p>This office of Commiſſary ſeems to me the moſt needleſs expence the crown is at, as it only ſerves for a ſubject of ridicule both to the traders and ſavages, which laſt ſcruple not often to give the officer in this nation the (among them) ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous epithet of old woman; and he can do but little towards preventing diſorders among them, or in regulating the ſtandard of the trade; beſides, i am ſure that whatever Commiſſiary dared to pretend to be any thing more than a cypher, would run an imminent riſque of his life.</p>
               <p>Their numbers have been very large, and they themſelves have a tradition that they were a colony from another nation in the Weſt, and that they firſt ſet themſelves down near the <hi>Ohio,</hi> but ſoon removed to their preſent Site; the greateſt number that their gunmen can now be reckoned at, does not exceed too hundred and fifty; it is really amazing, to think, that ſuch a handfull keeps about ten thouſand of the men of the other tribes from deſtroying them; but their ferocity and the way of making war among the ſavages which gives no advantage to numbers, becauſe the war parties of a ſmall nation are as numerous as thoſe of a larger one) has long ſaved them from deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Strong liquors make a ſad havock among theſe as among all other nations of the ſavages in the North.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="unknown:014440_0086_0F92659E6A3177C8"/>They are ſtrong, and ſwift of foot, and their exerciſe at home is chiefly their ball play, a very laborious diverſion.</p>
               <p>They are horridly given to ſodomy, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that crime even on the dead bodies of their enemies, thereby (as they ſay) degrading them into women.</p>
               <p>In their war parties, they have generally one who has done moſt miſchief to the enemy for their leader; but he is ſo far from having a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that an attempt, to do more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing whether ſuch or ſuch an undertaking would not be moſt adviſeable, or at moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading them to it, would at leaſt be followed by a total deſertion.</p>
               <p>They are very ceremonious in their preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for war, and their fondneſs for witchcraft makes them look for omens of futurity.</p>
               <p>They and all other ſavages have the greateſt ſhare of patience imaginable; when a ſcalp or priſoner is in queſtion, they will travel hundreds of miles in the deſarts, with amazing precaution, enduring hunger, and often thirſt, at a great rate; nay if their proviſions fail before they ſtrike the blow, they have been known to return to hunt for more in ſome ſafe place, and without going home, to make a ſecond or third attempt.</p>
               <p>They make war by ſtratagem, ſurpriſe or am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh, deſpiſing us as fools for expoſing ourſelves to be ſhot at like marks. A man's valour with them conſiſts in their cunning, and he is deemed the greateſt hero who employs moſt art in ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing his enemy; they never ſtrike a blow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they think themſelves ſure of a retreat, and the loſs of many men is an infamous crime laid to the charge of the party,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="unknown:014440_0087_0F92659F401D1D20"/>They bury their dead almoſt the moment the breath is out of the body, in the very ſpot under the couch on which the deceaſed died, and the neareſt relations mourn over it with woeful la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations; the women are very vociferous in it, but the men do it in ſilence, taking great care not to be ſeen any more than heard at this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the mourning continues about a year, which they know by counting the moons, they are eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry morning and evening, and at firſt throughout the day at different times, employed in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of this laſt duty.</p>
               <p>A people who by many peculiar cuſtoms, are very different from the other red men on the continent, will next amuſe us: They are the Chactaws, more commonly known by the name of the Flatheads. Theſe people are the only na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from whom i could learn any idea of a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional account of a firſt origin; and that is their coming out of a hole in the ground, which they ſhew between their nation and the Chica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaws; they tell us alſo that their neighbours were ſurpriſed at ſeeing a people riſe at once out of the earth; dark as this account of a firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of theſe people is to us, we diſcover in it a higher idea of an origin than among their neighbours, who never pretend to tell from whence they came, and have only looſe ideas of a migration from the north weſt; which prevail among the Chicaſaws and all other ſouthern nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>The Chactaws may more properly be called a nation of farmers than any ſavages i have met with; they are the moſt conſiderable people in Florida, and their ſituation may be known by
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:014440_0088_0F92659FE9E816A0"/>
the annexed plan of their country: Their hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grounds are in proportion leſs conſiderable than any of their neighbours; but as they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little jealous of their territories, nay with eaſe part with them, the Chicaſaws and they never interrupt each other in their hunting; as i menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned before.</p>
               <p>They are in their warlike temper far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch cowards as people in general will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, but it is true they are not ſo fond of wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering abroad to do miſchief as the other ſavages are; few of ſuch expeditions are undertaken by them, and they g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ve for a reaſon, that in going abroad they may chance to be obliged to content themſelves with a woman's or child's ſcalp, but in ſtaying at home and waiting the attack of the enemy, they by purſuing them, are ſure to take men, which is a greater mark of valour: be this as it will, it is certain they are carefully, cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly, and bravely watchfull at home, and on ſeveral occaſions they have, after many inſults, boldly offered to meet their enemies in equal numbers on a plain, which has always been by the other ſavages treated with ſcorn, as cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice; however when it has happened by chance that they meet ſo, we have ſeen them brave and victorious. Even in the very town of Mobile, an action of this kind happened deſerving a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, when they drove their enemies (the Creeks) through the river, and but for their inability to ſwim, they would have totally deſtroyed them; the Captain <hi>Hooma</hi> or red Captain fighting with forty Men againſt three hundred Creeks, and with his own hand deſtroying thirteen of their Chiefs, even when fighting on his knees, and
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:014440_0089_0F9265A5765A5650"/>
when he fell, bravely telling who he was, and his being flead alive for his heroiſm, is ſo freſh in every one's memory (being not above ſix Years ago) that many living evidences can teſtify it; I thought the action worthy of this attempt, to ſave it from oblivion. They have deſerted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their eaſtern frontier towns ſince their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent war with the Creeks, but during my ſtay in their nation, i ſaw four or five inſtances of their not ſuffering their enemy to eſcape unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, when he dared to commit depredations, and they valued themſelves on the event of the preſent war, when in 1771, news coming among the Traders, that the Creeks computed their loſs at near three hundred perſons, and they having gueſſed the number of their's, loſt much the ſame; they ſaid, we have loſt many women and children and even of them ſome Scalps have been retaken, but we like men, have killed men only, and got all the marks thereof; this war began in Auguſt 1765; the readers may judge at the greatneſs of their exploits, when i aſſure them, that that number was the total loſs during all that time.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſavages were the ſtaunch and firm friends of the French while they continued on the continent, until ſome Engliſh traders found means to draw the eaſt party, and the diſtrict of <hi>Cooſa</hi> (which together are called <hi>Oypat-oocooloo,</hi> or the ſmall nation) into a civil war with the weſtern diviſions called <hi>Oocooloo-Falaya, Oocooloo-Hanalé,</hi> and <hi>Chickaſawhays,</hi> which after many conflicts and the deſtruction of eaſt <hi>Congeeto,</hi> ended with the peace in 1763. I believe they are a nation whoſe word may be depended on
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:014440_0090_0F9265A76A418528"/>
when they give into the intereſt of any perſon, and that their faith is to be better relied on than that of the Chicaſaws or Creeks, which two laſt are really verſed in all the gallic tricks of deceit.</p>
               <p>At the congreſs of 1771, there were two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand three hundred of this nation nearly all men, at Mobile on the ſuperintendants books; in the nation i found at above ſeventy of their villages, about two thouſand men, and in the woods and hunting grounds, i was at and heard of as many camps as could make no leſs than ſix hundred men more. The French uſed to keep them very poor, but the yearly ſmall gifts they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to, were more proper to leave an idea of gratitude on the mind of a ſavage, than our ſeptennial great ones.</p>
               <p>Monſieur de Kerlerec and others made a fine juggle and kind of monopoly of this trade, which was very ill brooked by the French; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though i make no doubt of the Gentlemen's hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gone beyond the orders of their court, and notwithſtanding i am a bitter enemy to unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able regraters, yet i am certain that a monopoly of this trade under proper reſtrictions would prove an advantage and ſecurity to the colonies, ſince now the villainous over reachings, chica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery, and mutual calumniations of the abandoned wretches, who reſide among the ſavages, joined to their worſe than brutiſh or ſavage way of life, tend to the rendering the nation to which they belong infamous, deſpicable, and ſcandalous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſavages, as well as to turn the hopes of advantage into a real diſadvantage; and i dare venture to ſay, that unleſs ſuch reſtrictions take place, the different ſavages will always find
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:014440_0091_0F9265A79EA663C8"/>
reaſon to complain againſt the colonies, and join in cabals againſt the poor ſettlers in the remote counties, and at laſt oblige the colonies to take the diſagreable ſtep of realizing our mock au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, by extirpating all ſavages that dare to remain on the Eaſt of the Miſſiſſippi.</p>
               <p>But to return to the war-like inclinations of the Chactaws, and not to involve myſelf in poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; i take them to be a brave people, who can upon occaſion defend themſelves very coolly, for during my ſtay in the nation, a woman of that tribe made a bargain with me to give her ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition for ſome proviſions i bought of her; and when i expreſſed my ſurpriſe thereat, ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me that ſhe kept a gun to defend her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as well as her huſband did; and i have ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times ſeen armed women in motion with the parties going in purſuit of the invading enemy, who having completed their intended murder, were flying off.</p>
               <p>They never exerciſed ſo much cruelty upon their captive enemies as the other ſavages; they almoſt always brought them home to ſhew them, and then diſpatched them with a bullet or hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et; after which, the body being cut into many parts, and all the hairy pieces of ſkin converted into ſcalps, the remainder is buried and the above trophies carried home, where the women dance with them till tired; then they are expoſed on the tops of the hot houſes till they are annihiliated. The ſame treatment is exerciſed on thoſe who are killed near the nation, but he that falls in battle at a diſtance is barely ſcalped.</p>
               <p>Their addictedneſs to pretended witchcraft leads them into a very ſuperſtitious behavour
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:014440_0092_0F9265A92834FFD0"/>
when on an expedition which is remarkable, they carry with them a certain thing which they look on as the genius of the party; it is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the ſtuffed ſkin of an owl of a large kind; they are very careful of him, keep a guard over him, and offer him a part of their meat; ſhould he fall, or any other ways be diſordered in poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the expedition is fruſtrated; they always ſet him with his head towards the place of deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and if he ſhould prove to be turned di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary, they conſider this as portending ſome very bad omen, and an abſolute order to return; ſhould therefore any one's heart fail him, he needs only watch his opportunity to do this to ſave his character of a brave or true man. There is alſo a ſpecies of <hi>Motacilla</hi> (which i often endeavoured to catch, in vain) whoſe chirping near the camp, will occaſion their immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
               <p>Their war camps are already mentioned.</p>
               <p>They are given to pilfering, but not ſo much as the Chicaſaws.</p>
               <p>They are the ſwifteſt of foot of any ſavages in America, and very expert in tracking a flying enemy, who very ſeldom eſcapes.</p>
               <p>Their leader can not pretend to <hi>command</hi> on an expedition, the moſt he can do, is to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to <hi>perſuade,</hi> or at the extent, he can only pretend to a greater experience in order to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force his counſel; ſhould he pretend to order, deſertion would at leaſt be his puniſhment, if not death.</p>
               <p>Their exerciſes agree pretty much with what i have ſeen among other nations: from their infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy they learn the uſe of bows and arrows; they
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:014440_0093_0F9265A9B1B887E8"/>
are never beaten or otherways rudely chaſtiſed, and very ſeldom chid; this education renders them very willful and wayward, yet i think it preferable to the cruel and barbarous treatment indiſcriminately uſed by ſome European parents, who might with ſlight puniſhments by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of wholeſome chriſtian Admonitions, work in a very different manner on the tender inclinations of pliable infancy.</p>
               <p>The young ſavages alſo uſe a very ſtrait cane eight or nine feet long, cleared of its inward diviſions of the joints; in this they put a ſmall arrow, whoſe one end is covered one third of the whole length with cotton or ſomething ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to it: this they hold neareſt their mouth and blow it ſo expertly as ſeldom to miſs a mark fifteen or twenty yards off and that ſo violently as to kill ſquirrils and birds therewith; with this inſtrument they often plague dogs and other animals according to the innate diſpoſition to cruelty of all ſavages, being encouraged to take a delight in torturing any poor animal that has the misfortune to fall into their hands; thinking beſt of him, who can longeſt keep the victim in pain, and invent the greateſt variety of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. When growing up, they uſe wreſtling, running, heaving and lifting great weights, the playing with the ball two different ways, and their favourite game of <hi>chunké,</hi> all very violent exerciſes.</p>
               <p>The exceſs in ſpirituous liquors to which they uſe themſelves, is really incredible.</p>
               <p>Their meetings about ſerious matters are at night. Their belief in charms and exorciſms is firm and out of reaſon, and he that ſhould dare
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:014440_0094_0F9265AA80915708"/>
openly to boaſt of this gift is ſure to loſe his life on the firſt misfortune in the town where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides; but if it is only pretended to extend to the cure of wounds and diſeaſes it is overlooked; when they prepare for war, and when they return they uſe exorciſms, they call them all phyſic though only bare words or actions; and if they prove unſucceſsful, they ſay the phyſic was not ſtrong enough; it is no ſmall diverſion to ſee a Chactaw during this preparation act all his ſtrange geſtures, and the day before his departure paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſcarlet and black almoſt naked and with ſwan wings to his arms run like a bacchant up and down through the place of his abode; not drunk neither, as rum is by them avoided like poiſon during this preparation.</p>
               <p>While i was in this nation, i had the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to be afflicted with a violent fever which ended in a flux; my own ſkill being baffled, i applied to my guide, who had the reputation of being a knowing Phyſician well acquainted with the ſimples uſed among them. I ſubmitted to his preſcription; he got ſome herbs and roots, and made a decoction of them; i drank it; while the effect was expected, he alternately burnt ſome of the ſimples and ſat down by me blowing upon me to drive away the diſorder; i found no bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by it; and on my refuſing an other trial he ſaid i was a fool, the next time the phyſic would be ſtronger, but he was not affronted.</p>
               <p>The French have made great attempts to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this nation Chriſtians; at <hi>Chicaſawhay</hi> there reſided a miſſionary and a chapel was built, but they were abſolutely unſucceſsful; the ſavages always derided the Jeſuit, called him a woman,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:014440_0095_0F9265AB4015D9C0"/>
and would frequently deſire him to take away his phyſic, thereby meaning he would undo his ceremony of baptiſm; and when the Engliſh ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived there they would go up to the altar and imitate all the jeſuitical farce, telling them that they were not ſuch fools as to hear him; the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel was deſtroyed before i came there in 1771, but the croſs (being of lightwood <note n="*" place="bottom">The heart of yellow pine.</note>) ſtood yet.</p>
               <p>Their play at ball is either with a ſmall ball of deer ſkin or a large one of woollen rags; the firſt is thrown with battledores, the ſecond with the hand only; this is a trial of ſkill between village and village; after having appointed the day and field for meeting, they aſſemble at the time and place, fix two poles acroſs each other at about an hundred and fifty feet apart, they then at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to throw the ball through the lower part of them, and the oppoſite party trying to prevent it, throw it back among themſelves, which the firſt again try to prevent; thus they attempt to beat it about from one to the other with amazing violence, and not ſeldom broken limbs or diſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated joints are the conſequence; their being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt naked, painted and ornamented with fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, has a good effect on the eye of the by ſtander during this violent diverſion; a number is agreed on for the ſcore, and the party who firſt gets this number wins.</p>
               <p>The women play among themſelves (after the men have done) diſputing with as much eagerneſs as the men; the ſtakes or betts are generally high. There is no difference in the other game with the large ball, only the men and women play pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly, and they uſe no battledores.</p>
               <p>Their favourite game of <hi>chunké</hi> is a plain proof of the evil conſequences of a violent paſſion for
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:014440_0096_0F92641A1345CEB0"/>
gaming upon all kinds, claſſes and orders of men; at this they play from morning till night, with an unwearied application, and they bet high; here you may ſee a ſavage come and bring all his ſkins, ſtake them and loſe them; next his pipe, his beads, trinkets and ornaments; at laſt his blanket, and other garment, and even all their arms, and after all it is not uncommon for them to go home, borrow a gun and ſhoot them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; an inſtance of this happened in 1771 at <hi>Eaſt Yaſoo</hi> a ſhort time before my arrival. Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide has alſo been practiſed here on other occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and they regard the act as a crime, and bury the body as unworthy of their ordinary funeral rites.</p>
               <p>The mannner of playing this game is thus: They make an alley of about two hundred feet in length, where a very ſmooth caly ground is laid, which when dry is very hard; they play two to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether having each a ſtreight pole of about fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen feet long; one holds a ſtone, which is in ſhape of a truck, which he throws before him over this alley, and the inſtant of its departure, they ſet off and run; in running they caſt their poles after the ſtone, he that did not throw it endeavours to hit it, the other ſtrives to ſtrike the pole of his antagoniſt in its flight ſo as to prevent its hitting the ſtone; if the firſt ſhould ſtrike the ſtone he counts one for it, and if the other by the dexterity of his caſt ſhould prevent the pole of his opponent hitting the ſtone, he counts one, but ſhould both miſs their aim the throw is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed; and in caſe a ſcore is won the winner caſts the ſtone and eleven is up; they hurl this ſtone and pole with wonderful dexterity and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and fatigue themſelves much at it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="unknown:014440_0097_0F92641AB7BE4380"/>The women alſo have a game where they take a ſmall ſtick, or ſomething elſe off the ground after having thrown up a ſmall ball which they are to catch again, having picked up the other; they are fond of it, but aſhamed to be ſeen at it. I believe it is this propenſity to gaming which has given theſe ſavages an idea of a <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum</hi> above all other nations of America.</p>
               <p>They are extravagant in their debauches; when met for a drinking match ſome women at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them, when theſe find the men beginning to be heated with liquor they will take away all the weapons found near them and return with a callebaſh under their wrappers, then mixing with them, the men offer them their bottles, they take a draught and when not obſerved they empty it into the callebaſh, which when full they empty into bottles brought for that purpoſe, and thus they will accumulate two or three bottles full, and with the help of a little water, ſtill make them more; after a while rum fails among the men, and the women acquaint them, that they have got ſome; they are told to fetch it; they refuſe, ſaying it coſt them much and they cannot give it for nothing; a bargain enſues, they receive the conſideration firſt, and then bring it; in this way of trade they will often get all the effects the men can command for ſuch a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate nectar.</p>
               <p>I have a great opinion of a Chactaw's faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully performing his promiſes, i have ſeen ſeveral little inſtances thereof; they deteſt a liar, and ſhew gratitude to a man that keeps his word; my guide whoſe name was <hi>Pooſkoos Mingo</hi> gave

me an inſtance of this; when i left him he ſaid i had ſatisfied him for every thing like a true man, but if i would give him a ſpeaking paper to the great white man at Mobile (meaning John Stuart <abbr>Eſq</abbr>) then he would ſtill better know it; i gave him a note recommending him to that gentleman, and becauſe he had been of extraordinary ſervice on the journey, begged he would allow him ſomething more than common; it had the deſired effect, he got a good many things extraordinary; when i was afterwards miſſing, and it was thought the Creeks had deſtroyed us in coming from the Chicaſaw nation, this ſavage armed to avenge my death, and was actually taking the war phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick as they term it, when news was brought to the nation of my arrival at Mobile.</p>
               <p>They are well made both men and women; the women have agreeable features and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, but their naſty way of life in general diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figures them; thoſe that are cleanly are really at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive; the women disfigure the heads of their male children by means of bags of ſand, flattening them into different ſhapes, thinking it adds to their beauty; both men and women wear long hair, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſome young fellows who begin to imitate the Chicaſaw faſhion, and both ſexes mark their faces and bodies, particularly the women with indelible blue figures of fancy, among which is a great deal of voluted work of vaſt variety.</p>
               <p>Before the Engliſh traders came among them, there were ſcarcely any half breed, but now they abound among the younger ſort.</p>
               <p>Both ſexes are wanton to the higheſt degree, and a certain faſhionable diſorder is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among them. Sodom is alſo practiſed but

not to the ſame exceſs as among the Creeks and Chicaſaws, and the <hi>Cinaedi</hi> among the Chactaws are obliged to dreſs themſelves in woman's attire, and are highly deſpiſed eſpecially by the women.</p>
               <p>Their buildings are exactly ſimilar to thoſe of the Chicaſaws.</p>
               <p>Their way of life in general may be called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious, they will do what no uncompelled ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage will do, that is work in the field to raiſe grain; and one may among them hire not only a guide, or a man to build a houſe, or make a fence, but even to hoe his grounds; nay they will for payment be your menial ſervants to the meaneſt offices; no other unſubdued ſavage will do any more of all theſe than be your guide; they are very ingenious in making tools, utenſils and furniture; i have ſeen a narrow tooth comb made by one of theſe ſavages with a knife only out of a root of the <hi>Dioſpyros</hi> that was as well finiſhed as i ever ſaw one with all the neceſſary tools; this ſhews their patience.</p>
               <p>The Chactaws are very hoſpitable at their hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting camps, and there only they will entertain a ſtranger at free coſt.</p>
               <p>Here i muſt relate a particular cuſtom of theſe people: When a deer or bear is killed by them, they divide the liver into as many pieces as there are fires, and ſend a boy to each with a piece, that the men belonging to each fire may burn it, but the women's fires are excluded from this ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, and if each party kills one or more ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, the livers of them are all treated in the ſame manner.</p>
               <p>Horſes of a good kind are in ſuch plenty as to be ſold for a kegg of four gallons half water half
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:014440_0101_0F92641DB4810A40"/>
rum; they would be excellent were it not that they back them before the animals attain two years of age.</p>
               <p>They cultivate for bread all the ſpecies and varieties of the <hi>Zea,</hi> likewiſe two varieties of that ſpecies of <hi>Panicum</hi> vulgarly called guinea corn; a greater number of different <hi>Phaſeolus</hi> and <hi>Dolichos</hi> than any i have ſeen elſewhere; the eſculent <hi>Convolvulus</hi> (vulgo) ſweet potatoes, and the <hi>Helianthus Giganteus;</hi> with the ſeed of the laſt made into flour and mixed with flour of the <hi>Zea</hi> they make a very palatable bread; they have carried the ſpirit of huſbandry ſo far as to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate leeks, garlic, cabbage and ſome other gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den plants, of which they make no uſe, in order to make profit of them to the traders; they alſo uſed to carry poultry to market at Mobile, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it lays at the diſtance of an hundred and twenty miles from the neareſt town; dunghill fowls, and a very few ducks, with ſome hogs, are the only eſculent animals raiſed in the nation.</p>
               <p>They make many kinds of bread of the above grains with the help of water, Eggs, or hickory milk; they boil the eſculent convolvulus and eat it with the hickory milk; they boil green ears of corn, they boil corn and beans together, and make many other preparations of their vegetables, but freſh meat they have only at the hunting ſeaſon, and then they never fail to eat while it laſts; of their fowls and hogs they ſeldom eat any as they keep them for profit.</p>
               <p>In failure of their crops, they make bread of the different kinds of <hi>Fagus,</hi> of the <hi>Dioſpyros,</hi> of a ſpecies of <hi>Convolvulus</hi> with a tuberous root found in the low cane grounds, of the root of a
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:014440_0102_0F92641F841931C0"/>
ſpecies of <hi>Smilax,</hi> of live oak acorns, and of the young ſhoots of the <hi>Canna;</hi> in ſummer many wild plants chiefly of the <hi>Drupi</hi> and <hi>Bacciferous</hi> kind ſupply them.</p>
               <p>They raiſe ſome tobacco, and even ſell ſome to the traders, but when they uſe it for ſmoaking they mix it with the leaves of two ſpecies of the <hi>Cariaria</hi> or of the <hi>Liquidambar Styracifiua</hi> dried and rubbed to pieces.</p>
               <p>They prepare a kind of cloth out of the bark of a ſpecies of <hi>Morus,</hi> and with its root dye it yellow; i have all the reaſon in the world to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that this cloth might be manufactured into paper.</p>
               <p>Buffaloe's wool alſo furniſhes them a material for a uſeful manufacture.</p>
               <p>They likewiſe make blankets and other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings out of the feathers of the breaſts of wild turkies by a proceſs ſimilar to that of our wig makers, when they knit hair together for the purpoſe of making wigs.</p>
               <p>They have a root by means of which they dye moſt ſubſtances of a bright lading ſcarlet, but hitherto i have not been able to diſcover what it was.</p>
               <p>Many among them are well acquainted with plants of every kind, and apply them judicially both externally and internally; to others again they attribute ſupernatural virtues, for inſtance, there is one which they make uſe of to procure rain; for this purpoſe they have a number of people in their nation called rainmakers; theſe aſſemble in a deſerted field, and they boil this plant in a large pot, dancing and ſinging round it with numberleſs aukward geſtures; then if it
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:014440_0103_0F92642080E8BA20"/>
ſhould happen to rain ſoon after the jugglers boaſt the virtue of the plant; but ſhould no rain follow, they ſay the phyſick was not ſtrong enough; they take care however not to employ this rain compelling herb unleſs a cloudy day forebodes rain. The plant is very ſingular, and i believe a nondeſcript; i ſaw two ſpecies of it, but could not aſcertain the genius; the ſavages call it <hi>Eſta Hoola</hi> or the moſt beloved.</p>
               <p>The moſt remarkable thing of theſe ſavages is their inability to ſwim, occaſioned by their being remote from large waters; this art the people of <hi>Chicaſahay</hi> and <hi>Yoani</hi> who live on the banks of the <hi>Paſca Oocooloo</hi> enjoy alone, and incredible as it may appear, even moſt of their horſes partake of this inability, as many people and among others the Commiſſary for the nation have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me from their own experience.</p>
               <p>They help their wives in the labour of the fields and many other works; near one half of the men have never killed a deer or turkey dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their lives. Game is ſo ſcarce, that during my circuit through the nation we never ſaw any, and we had but two or three opportunities of eating veniſon in as many months; they take wives without much ceremony, and live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether during pleaſure, and after ſeparation which is not very frequent, they often leave the ſecond to retake the firſt wife.</p>
               <p>Fornication is among them thought to be a natural accident, therefore a girl is not the worſe looked on for ten or a dozen ſlips; but although they are not over jealous of their wives, they pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh adultery in the woman, unleſs ſhe happens to belong to a ſtronger or more noted and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

family than the huſband; in which caſe he ſcarce ventures even to put her away; but if ſhe is doomed to ſuffer, her puniſhment is to be at a publick place (for that purpoſe ſet apart at every town) carnally known by all who chooſe to be preſent, young and old; thus the poor wretch after defending herſelf and ſtruggling hard with the firſt three or four, at laſt ſuffers motion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the brutality of perhaps an hundred or an hundred and fifty of theſe barbarians; the ſame treatment is undergone by a girl or woman who belonging to another town or quarter of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, comes to a place where ſhe is a ſtranger and cannot give a very good account of herſelf and buſineſs, or the reaſon of her coming there; this they call running through the meadow, and if a white man happens to be in the town, they ſend him an offer or invitation to take the firſt heat; they plead in excuſe for ſo barbarous a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, that the only way to diſguſt lewd women is to give them at once what they ſo conſtantly and eagerly purſue.</p>
               <p>The education of their children i have already mentioned.</p>
               <p>The women ſuffer no more by child birth than any other ſavage women; they retire into a place of ſolitude at the time, and after delivery return to their daily labour; however while i ſtaid at <hi>Oka Altakkala</hi> in this nation one died in labour within about eighty yards of the houſe i reſided in.</p>
               <p>There are no laws or regulations obſervable among theſe people, except the <hi>Lex Talionis,</hi> and although they have a ſtrict notion of diſtinction in property, and even divide their lands, we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

hear them quarrel about boundaries; the above law is ſo ſtrictly followed, that i am fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with the following anecdote: It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that a young Chactaw having done ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing deſerving reproof, he was therefore chid by his mother, this he took ſo ill as in the fury of his ſhame to reſolve his own death, which he ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with a gun; his ſiſter as his neareſt rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thought herſelf bound to avenge his death, and knowing the circumſtance told her mother ſhe had cauſed her brother's death and muſt pay for his life; the old woman reſigned herſelf to her fate, and died by the hands of her daughter, who ſhot her with a gun which ſhe had provided for the cataſtrophe.</p>
               <p>In ſickneſs the juggling Quacks are conſulted, and as they are naturally good connoiſſeurs in ſimples, and judge pretty well of the nature of diſeaſes, they often ſucceed; but if a diſorder is obſtinate or incurable, the relations of the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent aſſemble in his houſe, bewail his misfortune, cry bitterly, take their leave of him, and he tells them how tired he is of life, that his misfortunes are unſufferable, and that it is good he ſhould die; upon this an univerſal howl is raiſed, the neareſt male relation jumps on him, and violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a moment breaks the neck of the patient, and then they rejoice that his miſery is over, but lamentations for his departure ſoon ſucceed.</p>

As ſoon as the deceaſed is departed, a ſtage is erected (as in the annexed plate is repreſented) and the corpſe is laid on it and covered with a bear ſkin; if he be a man of note, it is deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and the poles painted red with vermillion and bears oil; if a child, it is put upon ſtakes ſet acroſs; at this ſtage the relations come and weep, aſking many queſtions of the corpſe, ſuch as, why he left them? did not his wife ſerve him well? was he not contented with his children? had he not corn enough? did not his land pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſufficient of every thing? was he afraid of his enemies? &amp;c. and this accompanied by loud howlings; the women will be there conſtantly, and ſometimes with the corrupted air and heat of the ſun faint ſo as to oblige the by ſtanders to carry them home; the men will alſo come and mourn in the ſame manner, but in the night or at other unſeaſonable times, when they are leaſt likely to be diſcovered.</p>

               <p>They are the next moſt numerous nation after the <hi>Chactaws;</hi> but becauſe i have not been ſo univerſally through this nation as through the the others, i cannot ſo nearly calculate their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, but to all appearance, three thouſand five hundred gun men is all the extent; this confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of remnants is a race of very cunning fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and with regard to us, the moſt to be dreaded of any nation on the continent, as well for their indefatigable thirſt for blood (which makes them travel incredibly for a ſcalp or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner) as for their being truly politicians bred, and ſo very jealous of their lands, that they will not only not part with any, but endeavour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to enlarge their territories by conqueſt and claiming large tracts from the Cherokees and Chactaws.</p>
               <p>As an inſtance of their politicks, i beg leave to relate the following fact: When in 1764 and 1765, Meſſrs. Rea and Galphus of Georgia, had the contract of providing Penſacola with beef,
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:014440_0110_0F92642E4B710038"/>
they were of neceſſity obliged to have the cattle drove through this nation, who never ſuffered any but <hi>oxen</hi> to paſs, the tendency of this prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition muſt be obvious to every reader.</p>
               <p>They are all remarkably well ſhaped, they live in a level country full of rivers, are expert ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and in general a very hardy race; what deſerves notice here is that their <hi>Thorax</hi> is very ſhallow, ſo that a ſavage of this race may appear almoſt a giant by the breadth of his ſhoulders and yet not meaſure ſo much in circumference as an ordinary European; but whether this is the effect of art or nature, i cannot pretend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide; their women are handſome and many of them very cleanly, they are very hoſpitable and never fail of making a ſtranger heartily welcome, offering him the pipe as ſoon as he arrives, while the good women are employed to prepare a diſh of veniſon and homany,<note n="*" place="bottom">Maize coarſly pounded, ſifted and boiled in water.</note> with ſome bread made of maize and flour, and being wraped in maize leaves, baked under the aſhes; when it is ſerved up they accompany it with bears fat purified to a perfect chryſtalline oyl, and a bottle of honey with which laſt article the country abounds, and it is of ſo good a quality, as in my opinion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed that of <hi>Calabria</hi> and <hi>Minorca.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the lower nation and the allied tribes, there are many who keep rice by them and have plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of beef; of all which articles they are profuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly liberal, and i believe had they only a ſingle potatoe, they would ſhare it with a ſtranger. In the fruit ſeaſon they never fail to accompany theſe regales with melons, peaches, plumbs, grapes, or ſome other wild fruit.</p>

At this place he is entertained with tobacco and caſſine drink; this is alſo the common reſort of their old men and warriors to deliberate on mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of peace and war, to judge what ſteps are to be taken for the welfare of the nation, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the fate of their neighbours; ſo that this ſquare doth not ill anſwer to the deſcription we have of the Roman <hi>Forum</hi> or Athenian <hi>Areopage;</hi> the evening ends in a dance, which is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practice every night.</p>
               <p>To relate any thing concerning the wars of this nation, would be no more than repeating what has been ſaid of the Chicaſaws.</p>
               <p>Their way of life is in general very abundant; they have much more of veniſon, Bear, turkies; and ſmall game in their country than their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours have, and they raiſe abundance of ſmall cattle, hogs, turkeys, ducks and dunghill fowls (all which are very good in their kind) and of theſe they ſpare not; the labour of the field is all done by the women; no ſavages are more proud of being counted hunters, fiſhermen, and warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors: were they to cultivate their plentiful coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, they might raiſe amazing quantities of grain and pulſe, as it is they have enough for their home conſumption, they buy a good deal of rice, and they are the only ſavages that ever i ſaw that could bear to have ſome rum in ſtore; yet they drink to exceſs as well as others; there are few towns in this nation where there is not ſome ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage reſiding, who either trades of his own ſtock,
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:014440_0113_0F92643089711188"/>
or is employed as a factor. They have more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety in their diet than other ſavages: They make pancakes; they dry the tongues of their veniſon; they make a cauſtick ſalt out of a kind of moſs found at the bottom of creeks and rivers, which although a vegetable ſalt, does not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiate on expoſing to the air; this they diſſolve in water and pound their dried veniſon till it looks like oakum and then eat it dipped in the above ſauce; they eat much roaſted and boiled veniſon, a great deal of milk and eggs; they dry peaches and perſimmons, cheſnuts and the fruit of the <hi>chamaerops,</hi> they alſo prepare a cake of the pulp of the ſpecies of the <hi>paſſi flora,</hi> vulgarly called may apple; ſome kinds of acorns they alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare into good bread; the common eſculent <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volvulus</hi> and the ſort found in the low woods, both called potatoes, are eat in abundance among them; they have plenty of the various ſpecies of <hi>Zea</hi> or maize, or the <hi>Phaſcolis</hi> and <hi>Dolichos,</hi> and of different kinds of <hi>Panicum;</hi> bears oyl, honey and hickory milk are the boaſt of the country; they have alſo many kinds of ſalt and freſh water turtle, and their eggs, and plenty of fiſh; we like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe find among them ſalted meats, corned veniſon in particular, which is very fine; they cultivate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of melons; in a word, they have natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the greateſt plenty imaginable; were they to cultivate the earth they would have too much; vaſt numbers of horſes are bred here, but of an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent kind; and theſe ſavages are the greateſt horſe ſtealers yet known: it is impoſſible to be ſure of a horſe wherever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

decoction of them; the men only are permitted to drink this liquor to which they attribute many virtues, and it is made ſo ſtrong as to be black and raiſe a froth; when they drink it at their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies in the ſquare, they call it black drink.</p>
               <p>Every afternoon a young ſavage warns the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage to dance; as ſoon as it is duſky they make a a fire of dry pitch pine, and round this they dance in a circle with many ſtrange geſtures, poſtures, and cries; the women ſing regularly and ſome very prettily to the muſick of a kind of drum. I have heard them ſing, and ſeen them dance to no more than the words <hi>Yahoodela, Ya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoyahena</hi> for above two hours.</p>
               <p>On this occaſion i muſt not forget to mention an inſtance of female fondneſs for dreſs, which i ſaw at one of theſe dancing aſſemblies: I obſerved the women dreſſed their legs in a kind of leather ſtockings, hung full of the hoofs of the roe deer in form of bells, in ſo much as to make a ſound exactly like that of the Caſtagnettes; i was very deſirous of examining theſe ſtockings and had an opportunity of ſatisfying my curioſity on thoſe of my landlady at her return home. I counted in one of her ſtockings four hundred and ninety three of theſe claws; there were nine of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at the dance with this kind of ornament, ſo that allowing each of them to have had the ſame number of hoofs, and eight hoofs to a deer, there muſt have been killed eleven hundred and ten deer to furniſh this ſmall aſſembly of ladies with their ornaments, beſides which, earrings, bracelets, &amp;c. are by no means forgot; an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of luxury in dreſs ſcarcely to be paralleled by our European ladies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="unknown:014440_0115_0F926431FB16FBD0"/>The men are alſo very fond of dreſs; my guide acroſs the Peninſula, employed above two hours at his toilet, at Mr. Moultrie's houſe, four miles from St. Auguſtine, before he would venture to ſhew himſelf in town.</p>
               <p>Their principal exerciſes at home are ball play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the manner afore related, and the juſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned dances; the women are employed, beſides the cultivation of the earth, in dreſſing the victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, preparing, ſcraping, braining, rubbing and ſmoaking the Roe ſkins, making mackſens of them, ſpinning buffaloe wool, making ſalt, preparing caſſine drink, drying the <hi>chamaerops</hi> and <hi>poſſiflora,</hi> making cold flour for travelling, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering nuts and making their milk; likewiſe in making baſkets, brooms, pots, bowls and other earthen and wooden veſſels.</p>
               <p>They live nearly in the ſame kind of habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as the two other nations already mentioned, except that their hot houſes are not circular but oblong ſquares; they learn their boys from their youth to endure all manner of hardſhips particularly ſwimming in the coldeſt weather; they make them frequently undergo ſcratching from head to foot through the ſkin with broken glaſs or gar fiſh teeth, ſo as to make them all in a gore of blood, and then waſh them with cold water; this is with them the <hi>Arcanum</hi> againſt all diſeaſes, but when they deſign it as a puniſhment to the boys, they dry ſcratch them (i. e) they apply no water after the operation, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it very painful; they endeavour as much as poſſible to teach them all manner of cruelty, by making them exerciſe it on the poor brute creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in order to be the better verſed in it when
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:014440_0116_0F926432B8E08818"/>
they want to exerciſe it on their own ſpecies, and others of the human genus, when they unhappily become their enemies.</p>
               <p>As hoſpitable as this nation is to friends, as irreconcileably inhuman are they to their enemies; there is hardly an inſtance of one miſerable pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner's ever having eſcaped their barbarity; the torments they put the wretched victims to, are too horrid to relate, and the account thereof can only ſerve to make human nature ſhudder.</p>
               <p>No nation has ſo contemptible an opinion of us as theſe. They practice unnatural commerce with their own ſex to as high a degree as the Chicaſaws; they, like all other ſavages, are very fond of dogs, in ſo much as never to kill one out of a litter, and it is not uncommon in the nation to ſee a dog very lean, and ſo ſenſible of his misfortune as to ſeek a wall or poſt for his ſupport before he ventures to bark.</p>
               <p>With regard to the women, their girls are the moſt arrant prudes and coquets in the world, though they will never ſcruple to ſell the uſe of their bodies when they can do it in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate; a perſon who wiſhes to be accommodated here can generally be ſupplied for payment, and the ſavages think a young woman nothing the worſe for making uſe of her body, as they term it; but it is a great falſhood which has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated of theſe ſavages, that they exhort their young women to cohabitation with white men.</p>
               <p>Polygamy is here allowed, though not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally made uſe of; they marry without much ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, ſeldom any more than to make ſome preſents to the parents, and to have a feaſt or hearty regale at the hut of the wife's Father;
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:014440_0117_0F92643375A51FB0"/>
when once married the women are bound to the ſtricteſt obſervation of obedience and conjugal fidelity, ſaying that ſhe that has once ſold herſelf, can not any more diſpoſe of any thing whatever; and of their wives they are the moſt unreaſonably jealous of any nation under the ſun. Adultery is puniſhed by ſevere flagellations and loſs of hair, noſe, and ears, in both parties, if they are taken; ſometimes they ſpare the noſe of the man, and i have known ſome inſtances of white men having this misfortune and being obliged to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the Commiſſary, or the neareſt Governor for a certificate to ſecure them from the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the pillory.</p>
               <p>Phyſick, or the knowledge of it, is another thing in which they pride themſelves not a little, but they apply that name to all kinds of exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſms, juggling and legerdemain tricks, as well as to the knowledge of diſeaſes and the ſimples proper to cure them.</p>
               <p>Once a year, about July, theſe people put out all the fires throughout the nation; they faſt the two next days; then the fire is lighted again ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their old faſhion (i. e.) by drilling with a hard piece of wood on a ſoft one till it catches which ſoon happens, thus all the fires are again lighted and univerſal feaſting enſues.</p>
               <p>The women are juſt as eaſily delivered as thoſe of the other ſavages, and immediately after birth the infant is plunged into cold water.</p>
               <p>They revere old age to exceſs; in extreme ſickneſs they will out of compaſſion break the neck of the decrepid or lingering patient.</p>
               <p>The dead are buried in a ſitting poſture, and they are furniſhed with a muſket, powder and ball,
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:014440_0118_0F92643430D54C08"/>
a hatchet, pipe, ſome tobacco, a club, a bow and arrows, a looking glaſs, ſome vermillion and other trinkets, in order to come well provided in the world of ſpirits.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Arkanzas, Kanzas, Kappas,</hi> or <hi>Kwappas</hi> are the only nation of any note after the three above named, with whom Weſt Florida has any connection, notwithſtanding they live on the weſt ſide of the river; they are ſuppoſed to be about four hundred gun men.</p>
               <p>This nation is famous for the death of <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand Soto</hi> in the year 1543, after his immenſe journey from the Bay of <hi>Tampe</hi> through <hi>Apala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia, Penſacola, Mobile,</hi> and the Chicaſaw nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. to the Miſſiſſippi, by his hiſtorian called <hi>Rio Grande;</hi> alſo the arrival of Mr. <hi>de la Salle,</hi> who in 1682, coming down this river and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken formal poſſeſſion of this country, went further down to its mouth, obſerved it in Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude 29, went up again as far as <hi>Illinois,</hi> thence to <hi>Canada</hi> and France, from whence he returned with a ſmall ſquadron in 1684 to find the mouth of the river once more, but through obſtinacy paſſed it ſo far as to get into the Bay of <hi>St. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> and river <hi>Bravo,</hi> where loſing his veſſels he attempted to find the <hi>Arkanzas</hi> a ſecond time, but after a long and tedious journey of almoſt three years he ſhared if poſſible a worſe fate than <hi>Soto,</hi> being murdered by his own people near the nation of the <hi>Caeni</hi> on the 29th of May 1687; this we gather from the writings of Mr. <hi>Joutel</hi> who was preſent at all the ſcenes i have related, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this affair, and who purſued the journey to the <hi>Arkanzas</hi> and <hi>Canada;</hi> this nation were till lately the declared enemies of the Chicaſaws;
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:014440_0119_0F926434ED913CC8"/>
their country is ſaid to be exceeding fine, but as i have not ſeen it i can not judge of it, i never ſaw above ſix of this race, therefore i only treat of them on account of their connection with the country i am deſcribing.</p>
               <p>In general their manners are very like thoſe of all other ſavages, but among them i find a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom not known by the other ſouthern nations which is that of a feaſt of dogs fleſh at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of war, which is a common practiſe among all the northern tribes; we are alſo told that an <hi>Arkanza</hi> is counted a warrior in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for having killed his enemies dog.</p>
               <p>As many various accounts have been given of the manner of a declaration of war by different ſavages, i will here acquaint my reader of my having more or leſs perſonal knowledge or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with every tribe between the river St. Lawrence and the bottom of the gulph of Darien, and i think i can give the following as an account that will ſtand the univerſal teſt in all that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
               <p>When war has been reſolved on by the leading men of the nation, a feaſt is prepared and all the chief warriors are invited; after a great deal of ſwilling, the cauſe of the aſſembly is eloquently made knows by ſome Orator, and the intended ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition ſubmitted to the conſideration of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; as ſoon as it is approved of, they paint themſelves red or black, aſſume a very gaſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance and behaviour, adorning themſelves many uncouth ways; they dance their war dances under a continual roar of the death whoop, every one relates the great actions of his anceſtors, and ſings the praiſes of his own, as well paſt as fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</p>

               <p>The practice of ſcalping their ſlain enemy i believe is univerſal, but thoſe in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the Dutch colonies have laid it by for another, that of cutting off the hands, which was in conſequence of a reward the company gave them for the hands of ſuch runaway blacks as joined the rebel Negroes, becauſe there were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of perſons ſcalped who have recovered, but after the loſs of hands they cannot any more uſe arms.</p>
               <p>Juggling and pretence to witchcraft, as alſo conſulting of omens, is common to the <hi>Arkanzas</hi> as well as others, and paſſes by the name of phyſick.</p>
               <p>They have ſo far a veneration for the alligator as not to deſtroy him, nor have i ſeen a ſavage who would willingly kill a ſnake.</p>

               <p>To give an idea of Indian hieroglyphick painting, i have ſubjoined the two following cuts; the firſt is Chactaw, and means that an expedition by ſeventy men, led by ſeven princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal warriors, and eight of inferior rank, had in an action killed nine of their enemies, of which they brought the ſcalps, and that the place where it was marked was the firſt publick place in their territories where they arrived with the ſcalps.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is a painting in the Creek taſte, it means, that ten of that nation of the Stag family came in three canoes into their enemies country, that ſix of the party near this place, which was at <hi>Oopah Ullah,</hi> a brook ſo called on the road to the Chactaws, had met two men, and two wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with a dog, that they lay in ambuſh for them, killed them, and that they all went home with the four ſcalps; the ſcalp in the ſtag's foot implies the honour of the action to the whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>

               <p>The primum Mobile of the welfare of theſe countries and of the wealth of their inhabitants are the African ſlaves; the primary fine ſpun conſtitution of Georgia, is a recent and ſtriking proof of this; that country would not this day have been worth the notice of any, had not the importation and uſe of Negroes been allowed on the arrival of Governor Reynolds; when this Gentleman came to the Government it had lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed under the adminiſtration of General Oglethorpe and the other truſtees for about twenty years and then the land was worth leſs than at the firſt beginning, but no ſooner had Mr. Reynolds arrived, and, among other uſeful regulations, the free uſe of ſlaves taken place, the country flouriſhed; it is now about ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years ago that this happened: Hutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſon's iſland before Savannah was then ſold for twenty pounds ſterling, as yet there is a great deal of it unimproved and it cannot now be bought for ten thouſand pound ſterling, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements likewiſe are far more perfect; amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as this increaſe of value is, yet i believe that

more it will be vanity for them to hope for an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulation of wealth.</p>
               <p>Do we not ſee Solomon's words fully verified in Negroes? <hi>A ſervant will not anſwer though he underſtand.</hi> The very perverſe nature of this black race ſeems to require the harſh treatment they generally receive, but like all other things, this is carried into the extreme; far be it from me to approve or recommend the vile uſage to which this uſeful part of the creation is ſubjected by ſome of our weſtern nabobs, but againſt the Phyllis of Boſton (who is the <hi>Phaenix</hi> of her race) i could bring at leaſt twenty well known inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the contrary effect of education on this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble generation.</p>
               <p>Treachery, theft, ſtubbornneſs, and idleneſs, the firſt in the more northern Negroes, and the three laſt in the <hi>Ebo, Angola,</hi> and <hi>Benin</hi> ſlaves are ſuch conſequences of their manner of life at home as to put it out of all doubt that theſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities are natural to them and not originated by their ſtate of ſlavery.</p>
               <p>Had <hi>Monteſquieu</hi> been well acquainted with the American colonies, he would not have made uſe of any argument ſo much below ſo great a man as the one quoted in the above named enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical production, which ſeems calculated to procure a greater number of vagabonds than we are already peſtered with. I think no man ought to be allowed the manumiſſion of his ſlave except he be bound for his good behaviour and induſtry, and idle free blacks ought to be ſold for the good of the community.</p>
               <p>The anecdotes of the ſublimity of Negroes
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:014440_0127_0F926442C75FBDB8"/>
ſentiments in their own country are very ſimilar to my anecdote of a ſavage ſhooting himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his mother reprimanded him, or another doing the ſame becauſe he loſt his all at play.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Le Poivre</hi> has mentioned the making ſugar in <hi>Cochin China,</hi> by free men, but it has not been obſerved, that thoſe free men make ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities, and ſell it at the low rate they do, only becauſe others who employ ſlaves in the ſame or in the adjacent countries, ſell them at that price, which may be eaſily proved, and conſequently oblige the others to do the ſame; nor that theſe free men live on the ſame diet as our ſlaves, and who will ſay that <hi>Cochin</hi> Chineſe ſugar after ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation ſells at a more reaſonable rate than Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van, Martinique, Jamaica, or any eaſtern or weſtern ſugar does.</p>
               <p>Have not all the endeavours of the ſeveral Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlatures in the Weſt Indies to introduce more white or free people proved abortive, by reaſon of their general inability for labour in thoſe climates?</p>
               <p>Is it not therefore better to employ thoſe, who labour at a ſimilar work in their own ſultry coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and in a ſtate of ſlavery too, than to make victims of men who can by no means be qualified for the fatigue of a ſouthern plantation.</p>
               <p>We have known not long ago ſugars &amp;c. as cheap in the Weſt Indies as in the Eaſt; it is the increaſe of conſumption in Europe and North America that renders it dear: I affirm that in America, neither ſugar, rice nor indigo can be made by whites at three times the price it is made now by the blacks, and i alſo affirm that the Weſt India lands are diſtributed among all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:014440_0128_0F926446EEF37090"/>
with leſs reſervation, than they are on the continent of Britiſh North America.</p>
               <p>Can any one ſay that the favourites of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind (i mean liberty and property) are any where enjoyed in Africa?</p>
               <p>The rhapſodical opinion that the earth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces more when worked by free men than by ſlaves may do in theory but not in practice; the contrary is eaſily made to appear; and i am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from the nature of the climates, that the ſame colonies when cultivated by free men would not produce one tenth part of what they do now; as for an equal diſtribution of property it is like Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington's <hi>Oceana</hi> or Sir Thomas More's <hi>Utopia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An European will outlive a Creole by means of his more regular life, not otherwiſe, and who knows not that Negroes attain with all their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour a much higher age than the generality of idle Whites.</p>
               <p>The fooliſh argument of the ſhortneſs of the Jewiſh hiſtory, as well as lugging in the practice of Polygamy by the head and ſhoulders (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the text quoted is not to the purpoſe) is too mean to be refuted.</p>
               <p>Let not therefore the narrow ſyſtem of mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity adopted by ſome of our contemporary enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Philoſophers reſtrain us from properly uſing this naturally ſubjected ſpecies of mankind; the impoſſibility of an European's bearing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite labour in thoſe climes is now ſo well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained as not to require any elucidation, nor can any one pretend to ſay, that the poſterity of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans born in the torrid Zone ought to bear its inclemency; what labour can we expect from men brought up in eaſe and affluence? It is pretended
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:014440_0129_0F926447B17EEDD0"/>
that our employing ſlaves is contrary to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the founder of our moſt holy religion, when he ſays: <hi>"Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thyſelf;"</hi> i need not make uſe of the confined ideas of the antient Jews, who thought that the title of neighbour did not extend to any thing beyond their own nation.</p>
               <p>I will then affirm, that there is a fivefold ſtate of ſlavery, not only known or permitted; but commanded in God's holy word.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. Thoſe who are condemned to ſlavery for their crimes, which we but too often experience to be the caſe with the ſlaves imported to us from Africa.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. Thoſe that are taken in war, which is the moſt general way among the Negroes to furniſh us with ſlaves, and who would be murdered; did we not induce their conquerors by our manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures and money to ſhew them mercy.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. Thoſe who are ſold by their Parents, which cuſtom obtains among many people even the refined and civilized Chineſe, not to mention ſome chriſtians, but moſt among the Negroes.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly Thoſe who ſell themſelves or are ſold for debts, or other wants, which not only the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, but our own laws juſtify.</p>
               <p n="5">5ly Thoſe who are born in ſlavery.</p>
               <p>I need not ſeek aſſiſtance from the laws actually in force among us to prove the firſt; <hi>Noah</hi> in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> chap. 9, v. 25, 27, condemns <hi>Ham</hi> to ſlavery for the crime he had committed, and in <hi>Exodus,</hi> chap. 22, v. 3, God commands us that, <q>If the Sun be riſen upon a thief, it ſhall unto him be a crime of blood, for he ſhould make full reſtitution, if he have nothing, let him be
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:014440_0130_0F926448722C21A8"/>
ſold for his theft.</q> Here let me remind my reader, how much eaſier the ſlavery of our Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes is, than the cruel captivity of thoſe, who for their miſdemeanors are condemned to the chain, the wheelbarrow or the gallies.</p>
               <p>For the ſecond read <hi>Joſhua,</hi> chap. 9, v. 23.</p>
               <p>Does not <hi>Exodus,</hi> chap. 21, v. 7, ſhew, that a man might ſell his child as a ſervant, only giving the maid ſervant a privilege above men ſervants?</p>
               <p>In the fourth caſe i think that (without leaving the point in view) i may aſk, does not the ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſell his liberty to his ſovereign or other Prince for his pay be it for a time or for life?</p>
               <p>Proverbs, chap. 11, v. 29, tell us, <q>That the fool ſhall be ſervant to the wiſe of heart.</q> Chap. 22, v. 7, <q>The rich ruleth over the poor and the borrower ſhall be ſervant to the lender.</q> Does not Jeſus himſelf, Math. chap. 18. v. 25 make uſe of a parable fully to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? <q>when he ſays: But for as much as he had not to pay, his Lord commanded him to be ſold, and his wife and children and all that he had, and payment to be made.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Exodus</hi> chap. 21, v. 4, tells us that; <q>if the maſter have given his ſervant a wife, and ſhe have born him ſons or daughters, the wife and her children ſhall be her maſters.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For the perpetuity of ſlavery read <hi>Leviticus</hi> chap. 25, v. 39, to 47, how abſurdly is <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſquieu</hi> again quoted, when in his L. 10, C. 3, he ſpeaks of a conquered nation, who through neceſſity are made ſlaves in their own country: every one knows that ſuch conquered people, who are ſuffered to remain at home at firſt under oppreſſion, ought by degrees to be made free
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:014440_0131_0F926449311FED80"/>
ſubjects, their good behaviour being their ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom; but who, even among thoſe refined mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, would emancipate his ſlave without ſome reward either private or publick?</p>
               <p>How <hi>Tacitus</hi> comes to be ſo pat to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of this acute Philoſopher i have not been able to learn; nor is the quotation from the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal hiſtory, or Mr. Robertſon of any more force: Since we are able then to get ſlaves in a lawful manner, why ſhould we now be reſtrained from buying them to cultivate our grounds, when all nations at all times have enjoyed that privilege?</p>
               <p>Had not the well known Chriſtian Doctor of the Coloſſian Church a ſlave called <hi>Onefimus?</hi> did not this ſlave run away (after having, as uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al with ſlaves, robbed his maſter) come to Rome and go to ſee St. Paul? Paul treated him kindly, inſtructed, converted, and baptiſed him and ſent him back to his maſter with a letter full of godly eloquence to perſuade <hi>Philemon</hi> to forgive his ſlave and re-eſtabliſh him in his favour, but by no means an exhortation, much leſs an order to ſet him free.</p>
               <p>It is not religion then nor chriſtian charity that forbids us to have ſlaves, but it commands us the duties we are to fulfil towards them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing them to obey us, and us to uſe them as a part of the reaſonable creation.</p>
               <p>Who knows not, that the Spaniards are ſo much ſlaves that they can not well be more ſo, were they bought by their King: And who, that is acquainted in the Spaniſh dominions, knows not, that a modern Iberian does himſelf more honour by ſaying <hi>(Soi Blanco)</hi> i. e. I am a

white man, than if he exclaimed, i am Noble!</p>
               <p>Shall after what i have ſaid, this Rhapſodiſt with his confined ideas, ſend us to ſome modern ſyſtem of religion, or ſay, that i have offered any thing contrary to the ſublime doctrine of the author of chriſtianity? Had this anonymous writer inſtead of playing with the word ſlavery, told us, that the Northern colonies had no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for Negroes, he would have ſaid more, than all he has advanced in his futile publication.</p>
               <p>A Negroe at the Miſſiſſippi is reckoned to bring in his maſter an hundred dollars per annum, beſides his ſhare towards all the proviſion conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the family; Negroes in general are uſed with more lenity there than in Carolina.</p>
               <p>I have in my diſſertation on the origin of the ſavages, which has ſwelled beyond my intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, made mention of a peculiar characteriſtic of the Negroe ſpecies, here let me be allowed to mention that they, like all others of the different ſpecies, and varieties of the human genus are born white, which colour ſoon changes, but on the moment of birth in both ſexes the exterior parts of generation will ſhew, whether the perſon will be black, yellow, brown, red or any other colour known among mankind.</p>
               <p>There is among the Negroes a kind of anoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous beings with white ſkins, feeble eyes, &amp;c. which have been ſo often deſcribed by other au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors that i ſhall not trouble my reader with a particular account of them; yet one obſervation i cannot forbear to make, which i believe will be found no leſs curious than new:</p>
               <p>Through all the Northern America the red men are univerſally ſo, but as ſoon as we come
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:014440_0133_0F92644AD19294B8"/>
on the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> we find ſome of thoſe unhappy anomalous individuals among the ſavages; i have myſelf ſeen ſeveral of either ſex of this forlorn kind among the <hi>Sant Blaſs</hi> nation, who call themſelves <hi>Ayomalas;</hi> they inhabit the South Eaſtern part of the <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> and i underſtand from others converſant farther South, that in South America it is common; theſe people are of ſuch an exceeding tender texture of ſkin, that it is diſagreeably fair and very liable to become ſcurfy and freckled; their eyes are nearly as red as thoſe of a white rabbit and very weak, ſeeing objects plainly only after Sun ſet, before Sun riſe, or in a cloudy day: Their hair is ſtraight, long, lank, and red, not participating of the harſh ſtrong texture of the hair of common ſavages; their in ability for labour, for want of ſight, cauſes the others of the nation to ſupport them; the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of theſe poor creatures however is again red and in the general courſe of nature.</p>
               <p>The manners and way of life of the white peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Florida, differ very greatly from thoſe in other provinces of America, particularly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of cloathing; they are very plain, their dreſs conſiſts of a ſlight waiſtcoaſt of ſtriped cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and a pair of trowſers of the ſame, and often no coat; if any, it is a ſhort one of ſome light ſtuff; in winter a kind of ſurtout, made of a blanket, and a pair of Indian boots is all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; the women alſo dreſs light and are not very expenſive; happy frugality!

               <p>A tranſition to the agriculture of theſe colonies comes moſt naturally in courſe; this ſcience (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the moſt noble and moſt uſeful of all employments) has not only had the protection and countenance of Monarchs and other great men, but they have even practiſed it, our preſent gracious Sovereign has ſhewn inſtances of his care of the art, and many individuals of rank in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Holland and France now practiſe it and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy its improvement, and the annals of all nations tell us, that the flouriſhing ſtate of that art was the happy period of their grandeur; and it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly is and always will be an honourable, innocent, pleaſant, and uſefull purſuit.</p>
               <p>The amazing multiplication of mankind in America, which ſince eighteen years that i have been acquainted with the continent has proceeded nearly, if not wholly, in a triplicate proportion, is entirely owing to this great art, and to the room this wide waſte of new world affords for its improvement; this art is the ſource of our gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur,

               <p>In this noble country then (which will afford not only all the neceſſaries but even the ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities of life) it ought therefore to be the principal object of our moſt arduous purſuits; all the products of the torrid Zone as well as of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate are capable of being produced in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect climate, let us ſee which of them moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves our attention.</p>
               <p>Before i deſcend to particulars a thought claims my notice; Weſt Florida is beyond meaſure hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in having its fertile ſoil more equally divided than the barren ſands which were choſen by the <note n="*" place="bottom">No doubt this was a ſcheme of the enemies of American population who ſee themſelves every way bafiled.</note> monopolizers of Eaſt Florida; theſe even over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked the moſt uſefull places there, and planted their baronies in the pine barrens. There let the lords be lumber cutters! The fertile part of Weſt Florida is more equally divided, and there popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation through agriculture does and muſt continue to flouriſh, happy circumſtance! for which Dr. Stork and the ſelf taught Pennſylvanian Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher deſerve our perpetual thanks.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Wheat will always be produced in Weſt Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rida eſpecially in the higher latitudes on the river, ſo that all attempts to ſtarve that country by blockade would be vain and fruſtrated; barley, and oats grow well in all the lighter ſoils, and rye may be produced in the moſt barren ſands of the province.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="unknown:014440_0139_0F92644F33762DD8"/>The cultivation of theſe are ſo univerſally known, that to deſcribe them would be ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding paper in vain, but a remark in regard to wheat (which has fallen under my obſervation) muſt not be omitted; in the lower latitudes wheat will grow exceeding well till it comes almoſt to maturity; but then of a ſudden a diſeaſe called the blaſt will often take it, and this in one night re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the hopes of a fine crop into a certainty that the beſt thing to be done next morning is to burn the ſtraw to clear the ground for ſome thing elſe; to prevent this an obſervant farmer of my acquaintance in Georgia <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Iſaac Young,</note> having found that rye was never ſubject to this diſeaſe, mixed ſome rye among his wheat, and the field eſcaped the blaſt; he repeated the trial till he was convinced of its efficacy, and then ſowed a field of about five acres with wheat, ſurrounding it with a liſt of about twenty feet of rye; he ſucceeded in this experiment alſo, and his repeated trials have now ſhewn that it may be depended upon as efficacious, and thus wheat may be truly made an univerſal grain.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The <hi>Zea,</hi> Maize or Indian corn is a grain by no means to be neglected; the rich grounds in the N. W. parts of Eaſt Florida about <hi>Alachua</hi> &amp;c. and the lands in the N. E. of Weſt Florida are peculiarly adapted thereto and will yield fifty or ſixty buſhels per acre, the intervale on the <hi>Tembechbè</hi> and the land on the Miſſiſſippi is capable of producing eighty buſhels per acre; even the ſandy land, or that which is little better than ſand, will yield according to ſeaſons from fifteen to twenty five buſhels an acre.</p>
               <p>The vaſt conſumption of this grain in food for mankind is very well known, but its ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior

goodneſs for the feeding of ſwine, poultry, and indeed all animals, joined to its eaſy culture and prodigious increaſe, makes it deſerve a rank before all other grain after wheat: Its culture requires the ground to be thoroughly hoed <note n="*" place="bottom">The ſavages anciently performed this with the ſhoulder blade of animals fixed on ſtaves.</note> or plowed, ſo as to make it entirely mellow, and break every clod, then holes are made at equal diſtances in regular rows, and four or five grains dropped in each and covered; in this part of the huſbandry the greateſt miſtake is often made through over greedineſs of land, the holes ought to be at the regular diſtance of five feet, which will leave room for the horſe or hand hoeing it much better, than if it was placed at four feet; ſome people are ſo near minded as to plant them only three feet a part, but this prevents the free circulation of air through the rows, of which this grain ſtands very much in need; this is ſo evident, that on planting in the ſame field ſome corn at three, at four, or at five feet diſtance, (ſuppoſe the ſoil equally good) there will be a difference of ſix feet in the height of the plants, for the beſt land can not raiſe the crowded corn to above ten or twelve feet, whereas that through which the air has free acceſs, is frequently raiſed to ſixteen, eighteen, and even twenty feet; <note n="†" place="bottom">I write for Florida.</note> nor is this the only difference, the crowded corn will not produce grain in any thing like the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that which ſtands at proper diſtances; a ſtem of crowded corn will hardly ever furniſh above three ears, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

long, nor have they their extremities ever filled, neither are the rows ſo compact nor cloſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as that of corn that has enjoyed more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; a ſtem of which will produce generally from three to five well grown ears from nine to twelve inches long, compact, and to the end full grown and of a wholeſome look; when the young plants are grown about five or ſix inches out of the ground, a man ought to go through the field, and pull up thoſe plants that look leaſt promiſing leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only three plants in each hill and the ground muſt be kept weeded; when at the height of a foot or thereabouts, it muſt have the firſt hoeing, the earth is then to be drawn round upon the root in form of a cucumber hill; and now it may ſtand till it attains the height of three feet, when it muſt have a ſecond hoeing, and be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of ſuckers, which will appear in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; when the grain is got to the growth of about ſix or ſeven feet, or when the taſſel or fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male flower begins to appear, it muſt again be relieved from ſuckers, and have a third hoeing, throwing the ground well up round its foot; in a large field theſe hoeings are moſt commodiouſly performed by the hoe-plow drawn by one horſe, but in new fields the hand hoe muſt aſſiſt, if not do all the work; all the trouble with which this culture ſeems burthened is amply repaid by this grateful grain, the time of ripening depends on the climate; the northern climes bring it tardily but the ſouthern ones haſtily.</p>
               <p>After this third hoeing the ſpike or male flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er will appear in perfection; you may now ſtrip ſome ſuperfluous leaves from the lower part of the plant which will prove excellent hay for a horſe

and ſome cows that are neceſſary to keep near the houſe; the corn having attained nearly its growth and the ſpikes not ſhewing any more <hi>pollen,</hi> which is the impregnating yellow duſt, that is ſeen on it during its flowering ſtate, we find the female flower or ſilken taſſel change colour; the ears fill and ſome lower leaves begin to fade, it will not be bad huſbandry to cut off all the tops above the uppermoſt ear; this is left two or three days to dry on the ſummit of the plant, then tied in ſheaves, it is as fine a hay as any known for fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſuch animals as are intended to be kept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the farm yard, or in the ſtable, and every prudent planter will find it his intereſt to keep ſome milch cows (at leaſt) at home; this lopping of the tops is alſo ſaid to contribute to the filling of the ears and the ſooner ripening of them: the corn ripens in four or five months from the planting, in Florida; the gathering is done by pulling the ear from the ſtem, and carrying it in baſkets to a place where it is ſtript of all its huſk except the inner coat, and then it is kept in ſome airy loft or granary: and when wanted for uſe, it is laid in heaps and threſhed with flails, and afterwards winnowed like other grain.</p>
               <p>A report has been ſpread that on the Miſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſippi it was only neceſſary to burn the canes, make a hole in the ground and put the grain in, and it will grow without culture; it is true, but leſs wiſe men than Solomon will know ſuch a field at ſight to be that of the ſluggard, and know the owner by his ſhabby appearance.</p>
               <p>To enumerate the vaſt variety of ways in employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this noble grain for food ſuch as <hi>hommany,</hi> muſh, groats, parched flour, cold flour, pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,

                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Anagreeta is the corn gathered before maturity, and dried in an oven or the hot ſun by which means it retains its ſweetneſs and is eaſily dreſſed, making a fine mixture in pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings eſpecially with peaſe, but this is only practiſed in the provinces of New York and New Jerſey.</note> and a multitude of other diſhes, that vary in the difference of ripeneſs, grinding or other ways of dreſſing it, would be too tedious and unfit for this work; however the mixing its flour in equal parts with wheat flour after macerating the firſt in water till the liquor becomes ſlightly acidulated makes ſo fine a bread that i could by no means think it juſt to forget the mention of this proceſs, the meal coarſly ground and cleared of bran, then boiled with a little ſalt in water, and thus mixed with wheat flour, makes alſo a palata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bread of great uſe to the poor; i hope my reader will excuſe this prolixity, ſo great a ſtaff of life deſerves ſome notice.</p>

Peaſe, as they are here called but improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe ſpecies of the <hi>Phaſeolus</hi> and <hi>Dolichos</hi> are meant, follow the maize in utility: It is well known that moſt people uſe them like European peaſe either green or dry, and ſome kinds, ſuch as the ſmall white ſort, the bonaviſt, cuckolds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, the white black eyed pea, the white crowder, and many others, are undoubtedly at leaſt as good; add to this that while young, hull and all, they make a fine eſculent diſh for the table, and when hulled they are as good as green peaſe, and as much admired; the hulls after threſhing are eagerly ſought after by cattle, and increaſe milk, the hogs fattened with this pulſe are the next beſt pork to thoſe fed with maize; thus they infinitely increaſe the quantity of food; their culture is eaſy, they are

generally now planted between the corn at the ſecond time of hoeing; they want little or no at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance in that caſe, as the corn ſerves them for ſupport to climb up by, and the further attendance on the corn alſo ſerves the crop of peaſe; i can not but think this huſbandry a very good one as by the time that the <hi>Cirrhi</hi> take hold of the corn it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently filled to be out of all danger of hurt from this paraſitical nature of the peaſe. I alſo believe that the haulm left behind ſupplies the land with ſufficient manure to re-eſtabliſh its vegetative vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, which maize is but too apt to exhauſt.</p>

pork from hogs fed with them is indifferent, and requires to be hardened a conſiderable time with corn; it is remarkable that in pork fed with them the fat always ſeparates wholly from the lean, which is likewiſe the caſe with that fed on the common peruvian potatoe, vulgarly called the Iriſh.</p>
               <p>The 4th and 5th are excellent food and deſerve a place on every table, the 4th cut into longitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal ſlices and fryed is a very good diſh; plainly boiled they are a good <hi>ſuccedaneum</hi> for bread.</p>
               <p>The 5th being leſs ſweet and more dry than the others are beſt for ſtewing with meat, ſuch as fat pork or beef, or a fat gooſe or duck, to make what is called an <hi>Haricot;</hi> their very mealy texture renders them the moſt proper in room of bread, or to mix with flour and make bread of.</p>
               <p>They are a profitable crop, and require a light ſandy ſoil which muſt be made very clean and mellow; they are planted in beds or hills, being propagated from pieces that have what is called an <hi>eye</hi> in them; they require two or three hoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and with this management will produce from three hundred to five hundred buſhels per acre; even the laſt, if we reckon ten hills ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to make a buſhel.</p>
               <p>About July, in rainy weather, ſlips are taken from them, and planted in beds to procure a crop of ſmall ones for next years ſeed.</p>
               <p>The very ſame treatment is here neceſſary for the peruvian potatoe, but it wants oftener co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering becauſe the heat of the ſummer ſun would ſtrengthen the poiſonous juices (with which this genus of night ſhade abounds) in thoſe that might be expoſed to the air; therefore they are
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:014440_0146_0F926456AC774918"/>
unfit for the field in this climate, nor will they bear to be kept any time but in the garden; they will yield ſix or eight crops yearly, of a very good kind for the table.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Buckwheat juſtly deſerves the next rank, it being the moſt fattening grain to all animals, but eſpecially hogs and poultry; which laſt are always ſurpriſingly multiplied where this grain is raiſed; to man it is alſo an excellent food; it is well known that in <hi>Philadelphia</hi> buckwheat cakes are one of the articles of that city at their break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſts; it is alſo a noble crop near an apiary, and will multiply honey greatly; it requires a light loamy ſoil well broke, and to be ſowed very thin, it improves land where ever it is planted.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The <hi>panicum</hi> or Guinea corn is next in this ſcale of the produce of the earth; it differs from maize in being more difficult to be reduced into food, and being of too hot a nature for brutes, eſpecially poultry, who will become blind by eating it often; it impoveriſhes land, but when ſown at broad caſt will yield a fine and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable crop of hay for ſuch as are inclined to keep horſes or milch cows near home, nor has it in this caſe ſo bad an effect on the ſoil.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Rice though ſo lucrative a commodity did not deſerve an earlier place in this enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe it is not properly a neceſſary arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle in the human Oeconomy in this country but a ſtaple branch of trade, not likely to increaſe the number of profitable members of ſociety; howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver notwithſtanding it is (for our uſe) only fit for puddings, and to put in ſoops, or to make the wafer-like bread called journey cakes in Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina, yet it muſt be mentioned here on account

               <p>The grain in the rough is very noble food for all quadrupeds and poultry; to manufacture it there is a great deal of labour neceſſary; when manufactured a quart per <hi>diem</hi> will very plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully feed a working Negroe, and the duſt, beaten huſk &amp;c. that comes off will cauſe all ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals on the plantation to be very fat, eſpecially turkeys, which no place on earth furniſhes equal to thoſe on a rice plantation; it will require eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or twenty buſhels of rough grain to make a manufactured barrel of 500 pounds weight: The time of planting is from the end of the froſt

to the 10th of June, and the ſeaſon for reaping is generally in October; a ſecond crop will riſe fit for fodder. In the twelve mile ſwamp in <hi>Eaſt Florida</hi> i have ſeen a ſecond crop come to perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and no doubt in the grand marſh in latitude 25, 30, in that province it would always yield twice.</p>
               <p>An acre will produce from ſixteen to eighteen hundred pound weight, manufactured grain, and one Negroe will attend three acres in a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat manner.</p>
               <p>This grain cauſes a great conſumption of cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and pine wood to be made into caſks; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a great deal of coopers labour is neceſſary, in which the planter ought to be obliged to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy white men, it not being harder labour than is conſiſtent with our temperament and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The proceſs of manufacturing rice in a great meaſure reſembles that of peeling barley; the planter who has water at command manufactures by a water mill, conſequently cheaper than he who is obliged to do it by horſes or by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual labour of his ſlaves.</p>
               <p>This grain has one great article in its favour, that is the number of hands it employs in tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting and exporting it, who may be truly ſaid to live by it.</p>
               <p>The machines for manufacturing it have been ſo often deſcribed and figured, that they hardly ought to be introduced into a work that bears the name of conciſe.</p>

               <p>Seed of the beſt kind abounds on the Miſſiſſippi, about four buſhels of ſeed are requiſite for an acre, it muſt be ſown in drills about two feet apart; the time of approaching rain is always beſt; the ſeaſon for ſowing ſets in the beginning of March and may be continued down till May; if the ſeaſon is any thing favourable it will afford five cuttings between March and November; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven weeks being a long allowance between each two cuttings; we muſt be very cautious about cutting, for if that be done in dry weather it will infallibly deſtroy the plant; but in rainy weather there is no manner of riſque of this; by this treatment and care, the plant is continued for years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the warmer climates; it ought to be cut as ſoon as there is any appearance of bloſſom, ten weeks from planting will generally ripen the ſeed perfectly; when cut, it is tied in bundles and carried to the vats.</p>
               <p>The vats are three in number and ought to be, the firſt very large, the ſecond one third leſs, and the third yet leſs: At the head of the large vat ſtands a pump to fill it with water; theſe vats par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the firſt or ſteeping vat, ought to be made of very hard timber; in this ſteeping vat the weed is thrown together, and preſſed down with pieces of live oak or other ſolid and ponderous timber; it is then covered with water by means of the pump; here it remains to ferment; the <hi>criſis</hi> whereby to know the exact time it is to remain in this vat is when the liquor thickens, begins vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently to efferveſce and aſſumes a purpliſh blue colour; this will be effected in a greater or leſs

               <p>In this ſecond or beating vat as ſoon as the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor is in, it muſt be beat or ſtirred by a proceſs ſimilar to churning; this is a laborious work and uſed to be performed by Negroes, who draw up and down a lever that has either one or two bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs ſquare buckets at each end; but of late horſes have been employed in large works; this churning is continued till the dying particles are ſeparated from the liquor, or as it were ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly congealed to form a body or maſs; here lies the ſecret of the art, for if the beating is ceaſed too ſoon a part of the dying matter remains undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, and if beat too long ſome part will again diſſolve; only experience can teach this <hi>criterion,</hi> and there is only one method to try it which is by taking up ſome of the liquor in a phial or cup and obſerving whether the dying matter is inclined to depoſe itſelf or not; all farther theoretical leſſons are in vain, the young planter muſt have recourſe to practice.</p>

               <p>The natural hiſtory of the plant and its cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, ſpecies and varieties will be found in the botanical account.</p>
               <p>Cotton will grow in any ſoil, even the moſt meagre and barren ſand we can find.</p>
               <p>The ſort we muſt cultivate here is the <hi>Goſſypi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Anniverſarium</hi> or <hi>Xylon Herbaceum;</hi> alſo known by the name of green ſeeded cotton, which grows about four or five feet in height. Give this plant a dry ſoil and further it will coſt you little trouble or attention; it muſt be planted in rows at regular diſtances about ſix feet apart; plant the ſeed in rainy weather and in about five months time the fibres will be compleatly form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and the pods fit to gather, which will be known by their being compleatly expanded; it muſt now be carried to the mill of which take the following deſcription.</p>
               <p>It is a ſtrong frame of four ſtuds, each about four feet high and joined above and below by ſtrong tranſverſe pieces; acroſs this are placed two round well poliſhed iron ſpindles, having a ſmall groove through their whole length, and by means of treddles are by the workman's foot put in directly oppoſite motions to each other; the
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:014440_0162_0F92646C80DFC528"/>
workman ſits before the frame having a thin board, of ſeven or eight inches wide and the length of the frame, before him; this board is ſo fixed to the frame that it may be moved, over again, and near the ſpindle; he has the cotton in a baſket near him, and with his left hand ſpreads it on this board along the ſpindles which by their turning draw the cotton through them being wide enough to admit the cotton, but too near to permit the ſeed to go through, which being thus forced to leave the cotton in which it was contained, and by its rough coat entangled; falls on the ground between the workmans legs while the cotton drawn through falls on the other ſide into an open bag ſuſpended for that purpoſe under the ſpin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles.</p>
               <p>The French in Florida have much improved this machine by a large wheel, which turns two of theſe mills at once, and with ſo much velocity as by means of a boy, who turns it, to employ two negroes at hard labour to ſhovel the ſeed from under the mill: One of theſe machines i ſaw at Mr. <hi>Krebs</hi> at <hi>Paſca Oocooloo,</hi> but as it was partly taken down, he claiming the invention was very cautious in anſwering my queſtions, i cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to deſcribe it accurately; i am informed that one of thoſe improving mills will deliver ſeventy or eighty pounds of clean cotton <hi>per diem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The packing is done in large canvas bags, which muſt be wetted as the cotton is put in, that it may not hang to the cloth and may ſlide better down; the bag is ſuſpended between two trees, poſts or beams and a negro with his feet ſtamps it down; theſe bags are made to contain from three hundred and fifty to four hundred weight; with

               <p>Among my botanical articles the reader will find the deſcription of one of this claſs, which i have all the reaſon in the world to believe to be the <hi>Morus papyrifera</hi> and which i have on <hi>page</hi> 20 <hi>of this volume</hi> diſtinguiſhed by the name of <hi>Morus foliis palmatis, cortice filamentoſa, fructu ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro, radice tinctoria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This tree is found in abundance in the North Weſtern parts of Florida: The chactaws put its inner bark in hot water along with a quantity of aſhes and obtain filaments, with which they weave a kind of cloth not unlike a coarſe hempen cloth; i would propoſe to boil the bark in a ſtrong alkaline <hi>Lixivium,</hi> by which means i make no doubt but a very fine and durable thread of the nature of cotton, flax or hemp might be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the root of this ſame tree likewiſe yields an excellent yellow dye: But i ſhall here treat of the article, which is moſt commonly known to be produced by means of the mulberry tree, this is ſilk: A very ſhort time about ſix weeks in the year will ſuffice for all the labour requiſite to acquire this valuable article, and that labour is ſo light as only need children to attend it</p>
               <p>The gathering of the leaves being the moſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious part of the work i would adviſe the ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the ſeed as it were at broad caſt, ſo that it may ſpring up in form of wide hedges of about ten feet breadth leaving a lane of two feet between each pair, by this treatment the leaves may be gathered by means of a pair of ſheers or if the hedges are narrower the hand may do it, without the diſagreable neceſſity of climbing trees, which is always more or leſs attended with ſome danger, and as this is a female buſineſs, with indecency.</p>
               <p>I am convinced mulberry buſhes will grow thus and yield abundance of leaves and therefore this method is eligible before groves or orchards, which take up much room and have a dirty ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect during the fruit ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>All the ſpecies of mulberry trees grow kindly in Florida and ſome people pretend the white kind to be beſt, but on my ſtricteſt enquiries i could not find in what manner this affects the worms, but i would have the ſilk planter be very cautious if he has one kind in his nurſery, ſtrictly to baniſh the other, becauſe this change of leaves is certainly the reaſon of ſome of the diſeaſes attending the worms: The remainder of the ſilk culture is no more than to keep the worms well fed, and the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where they are kept thoroughly clean; when they begin to acquire a certain tranſparency, the period of their ſpinning or reſolving themſelves into a <hi>Chryſalis</hi> is at hand; then it is neceſſary to put up bundles of ſome ſlight thin twigs between the ſhelves. The <hi>wild</hi> or <hi>dogs fennel</hi> affords a ready and proper material for it; here the worms will naturally enough mount upon and pitch on a place where to metamorphoſe themſelves into a cocoon; in Georgia we have a filature, likewiſe at Puryſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg; but as there are none in Florida i will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join

the following account of its preparation for the manufactury.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. The cocoons are to be put into an oven juſt hot enough to deprive the <hi>Chryſalis</hi> it involves of life, without hurting, the fibres of the cocoon:</p>
               <p>A heat ſomething below <hi>Fahrenheits</hi> ſcale for boiling water will effect this: without this precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the inſect eats its way out and deſtroys the thread of ſilk.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. It muſt then be put into a copper with water juſt on the boil and kept ſo, this will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the glutinous matter from the cocoon and diſcover the end of the clew; then taking ſeveral of theſe ends together they are gently reeled off, and afterwards ſpun and prepared for the loom.</p>
               <p>This proceſs is hurtful to the elaſticity and ſtrength of the ſilk, though it does not deprive it of its gloſs: Therefore if we could attain the knowledge how the raw ſilk is managed in the <hi>Levant,</hi> it would be the moſt eligible way; all we know about this is, that it is performed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hot water: this is called raw ſilk and comes in bales to England and other manufacturing coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
               <p>The refuſe cocoons either damaged by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect or other ways, are carded in Europe, and are then improperly ſtiled raw ſilk; this ſhould not be confounded with the above named from the <hi>Levant,</hi> being by no means equal to it. After the ſilk is reeled off, we find ſome irregular coar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer kind on the inner diviſion of the cocoon; da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged cocoons are mixed with this, as alſo the inner diviſion next over the <hi>Chryſalis,</hi> after being ſteeped in warm water to diſſipate its gelatinous parts; this mixture is carded and called <hi>floretting.</hi>

which makes its value to the planter very inconſiderable, i would rather cultivate none; it is a rank luxuriant, impoveriſhing vegetable, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring a deep rich ſoil ſuch as the Miſſiſſippi alone affords here; therefore it will undoubtedly thrive; its culture is almoſt identically the ſame as that of the <hi>Zea,</hi> but i would adviſe the planting it further apart, ſuch as ſix feet at leaſt; the only material thing this culture differs in, is becauſe the ſeed being exceedingly diminutive in ſize it muſt be ſown in beds of rich new ground, which has been well manured, with the aſhes of the bruſh cut off from it; from hence it is tranſplanted in regular rows at the above named diſtances: In about three weeks time it will be advanced to the growth of a foot: Now the firſt hoeing takes place, and ſuckers and worms begin to appear; from both theſe the plants muſt be carefully cleared.</p>
               <p>The plants are at this period out of danger of being ſcratched out of the ground by a large flock of turkies which may now be turned into the field, who will not touch the plants but carefully look for the worms that infect them, of which thoſe birds are very fond; and thus they will ſave a great deal of labour, but the ſuckers muſt be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to by human labour, which is alſo requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to keep the ground clear from weeds; when the plant attains the heighth of eighteen inches it muſt be deprived of its head and ſtripped of its lowermoſt leaves, reſerving a few with their heads on for ſeed: In about eleven weeks after they are tranſplanted the plants ceaſe growing and the leaves aſſume a variegated colour of different green ſhades; this is an indication of their matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;

they are then cut and laid in heaps to ſweat for about ſixteen hours; next day they are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to a ſhed, ſo conſtructed as to admit a free circulation of air through every part thereof, but well covered againſt rain; this is the practice in Virginia; in ſome countries they keep all the light out except where the rays cannot immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately reflect on the tobacco; in this ſhed they are hung with their tops downwards for about ſix weeks; then taking advantage of a day when the atmoſphere is pretty much loaden with moiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they are laid on a kind of floor of poles, and left to ſweat for about ten or twelve days; now the leaves are ſtripped off and the tops kept ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the middle and the lower leaves; the uppermoſt leaves being the beſt tobacco and the lower the worſt; they are then made up into very cloſe packed bundles called in Florida <hi>Carrots,</hi> which are held together by a ſtring of bark; there are at preſent but two ſorts produced viz <hi>Nanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toche</hi> and <hi>Pointe coupée,</hi> the firſt infinitely ſuperior to the ſecond.</p>

Pitch, tar and turpentine being the produce of vegetables will not improperly come in here; the proceſs of making the common tar is by ſplitting the heart of the pitch pine, fallen down (with which the ground is covered in the eaſtern and ſouthern parts of Florida) into ſmall ſticks of the length of about three feet, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range them into a kiln of a circular form; but as this is a proceſs hardly to be learned by theory, i will recommend it to the inquiſitive reader to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form himſelf at a tar kiln great or ſmall, which are a very common occurrence thoughout this continent,</p>

               <p>This is made from trees that have been tapped for turpentine, and continued running for about three years, by chopping the bark off by degrees to twelve or fifteen feet high; they are then cut down and ſplit into ſmall ſticks; and the tar is made by the ſame operation as the common ſort.</p>

               <p>As pitch and tar are often uſed to pay roofs of houſes &amp;c. and the addition of red lead &amp;c. made uſe of, which has proved ineffectual, and as the ſame obſervation takes place with regard to ſhips bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, were water (as does air in the former caſe) corrodes the pitch, i think it not improper to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the following note of the ingenious Dr. Lewis on Neuman's chymiſtry: <q>An anonymous cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent of the Swediſh academy obſerves, that the tarred or pitched boards or ſhingles, with which houſes in many places are covered are ſoon damaged by the heat and moiſture, the ſun's heat melting off the tar ſo that the wood remains bare. Some have endevoured to

prevent this, by laying on the tar late in the year, that the winter's cold might fix it; an expedient of ſome uſe, but very far from being effectual, for however the tar may be hardned by the winter, the return of ſummer ſoon makes it ſoft again. Others have mixed ſmith's cinders with the tar, which inſtead of mending the matter makes it worſe, all pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous ſubſtances do the ſame. He ſays, he has never found any addition comparable to coal duſt (that of charcoal he ſeems to mean) which is to be ſtirred into tar made hot in ſuch a quantity as to make it thick: The mixture is to be laid on with wooden trowels in a hot day: tar thus prepared, he ſays, is fixed, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver runs, binds and hardens ſurpriſingly from heat and moiſture and ſhines better than oil varniſh.</q>

               <p>If it be objected to the culture of Madder in <hi>Florida,</hi> that theſe are in a very different climate from the ſouthern part of <hi>Britiſh America,</hi> let it be remembered that in the <hi>Levant</hi> it is cultivated with ſucceſs, and that what comes from thence is a more valuable dye.</p>

The greateſt labour, i think, i have ſeen the people at in <hi>Holland,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to this culture, is the covering the ſtalks, when they attain the height of about ſixteen inches, leaving only the tops bare, in order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the multiplication of roots, which is the part o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This cultivation by ſets or ſhoots being prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed in countries where the ſeed does not at all, or very difficultly come to maturity, i think the ſeed ought to be introduced into <hi>Florida,</hi> or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours made to obtain it, from plants to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried or tranſplanted there, which, if productive of ſeed, it ought to be ſown in drills, like rice; which i would think the moſt elegible in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate climates of thoſe provinces. I believe this plant to be a great impoveriſher of the ſoil, for in <hi>Zeeland</hi> they always allow ſome years between eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry two crops in the ſame ſpot.</p>
               <p>As it has lately been ſaid, that there was no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity for drying Madder, and that in uſing it green, there is even in the evaporation of dying matter a ſaving of one half, beſides the greater ſaving of the expences of a kiln, a mill, a drying houſe, &amp;c. I muſt inform my reader, that he will find all this true, but then it will be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for him to tranſport the dying houſes from <hi>Europe</hi> to our Madder fields, and not the Madder to the dyers, in order to enjoy the profits of all this great and oeconomical frugality; for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps there is not a plant on earth ſo ſoon inclining to fermentation and putrefaction, which is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by its ſucculency; yet for the planters pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent family-uſe it is certainly fit to uſe green; as ſoon as the roots have become ſpotted, or black, or loſt a ſtrong ſcent (ſimilar to that of liquorice) they are utterly unfit for any uſe; i ſhall therefore make a few remarks, neceſſary to be known for

the drying proceſs in <hi>Florida.</hi> A hot, ſun-ſhiny day may be uſed to advantage, to dry the roots partially; but if the weather be not favourable, when the roots are taken up, they muſt be ſpread within doors on a floor, taking care to ſpread them thinly, and ſtir them often; but this will never abſolutely preſerve them from changing, much leſs make them fit for tranſportation to any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; if the crop be ſmall, a baker's oven may ſuffice, but beware of raiſing the heat above 180 degrees of <hi>Farenheit</hi>'s thermometer in the place where the roots are put, which ſhould be over the oven; but for larger crops kilns, ſimilar to malt-kilns are neceſſary; take care to make them roomy, keep an equal and moderate heat, and by all means prevent any the leaſt acceſs of ſmoke to the roots; for which reaſon I would adviſe large ovens, ſuch as the biſcuit bakers in <hi>Holland</hi> uſe, as preferrable to every other method; a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be ſo contrived as to contain 13 ovens, viz. four on each ſide, three at one end, and two at the end where the door is, with one general brick floor over all; one or two windows may be ſo contrived as to give acceſs to a ſufficient light; let us ſuppoſe the oven ten feet long, by eight wide, and allow two feet for each partition, this will make an oblong apartment of forty-two feet by thirty-two in the clear below, and on the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per floor fifty-two, by forty-two, room enough for any crop; provide good brick funnels to your chimnies, and there can be no danger of fire, the reſt of the building may be of timber; in this proceſs Madder will looſe five ſixths of its weight.</p>
               <p>When the roots are ſufficiently dried, they muſt be pounded in wooden mortars; for this purpoſe
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:014440_0184_0F926484861407C0"/>
a mill conſtructed exactly like the old faſhioned rice mills is very proper, only varying in the ſhape of the lower end of the piſtil, or beetle; for in the rice mills their lower end is in form of an inverted cone; but here the lower end ought not only to terminate in a ſquare, but the but-end ought to be cut into ſmall ſquares, ſo as to render the peſtle toothed; for this reaſon alſo the mortar ought to be of a different form from the rice mortar, which laſt is likewſe an inverted cone, or ſhaped like the ſide of the top of a funnel, whereas this ought to be in form of a hollow globe, which has a neck like a decanter or bottle, in which neck the peſtle ought nearly to fit. To empty the mortars and ſupply them with freſh roots, is a neceſſary occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation during the pounding. The roots ought to be cleared of their outer bark.</p>
               <p>It will then be fit for packing into caſks and exporting.</p>
               <p>I remember to have heard it ſaid in <hi>Holland,</hi> that poor people, in order not to be obliged to ſell their ſmall crops to the manufacturer, at his own price, preſerve the roots from fermentation, by burying them between layers of earth in the ground, and that by this means it may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for any term of time, without perceptible alteration.</p>
               <p n="45">XLV. <hi>Coffee</hi> being an article to all appearance fit to be raiſed in the ſouthern parts of the penin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſula, and ſome of the iſlands, i ſhall give it a place here. This is an object worth our notice, as its conſumption is great already, and ſtill increaſing; there is little or none produced in the <hi>Engliſh Weſt-India</hi> iſlands, in compariſon of that which the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> colonies produce.</p>

Uſually in about 14 days time the plant appears; when the young plants have attained the height of eight or ten inches, a rainy day is watched to tranſplant them into a walk, as it is there called, which anſwers to our orchards; the ground is here carefully cleared of all manner of roots and plants, and turned up at leaſt a ſpit deep. About twelve feet is the diſtance which ought to be left between every two plants.</p>
               <p>The growth of coffee is quick, provided the ground be kept clean, but perhaps no plant is ſooner hurt than this by too luxuriant a growth of weeds or plants, round or near it. The ſecond year <hi>Eddos</hi>

               <p>If any of the young plants ſhould fail, they ought immediately to be replaced by others.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Dutch</hi> colonies, when a coffee walk de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays,

they root the trees out, and let the ground lay fallow for ten years, or upwards, during which time it affords paſture for cattle, and afterwards it is turned into a cocoa walk, or cotton plantation.</p>
               <p>The ordinary height of this tree is from twelve to ſixteen feet; in the <hi>Dutch</hi> colonies they are lopped, to reduce them to a kind of <hi>Eſpaliers,</hi> for the eaſier gathering of the fruit.</p>
               <p>When the coffee has attained to ripeneſs, it is carried to drying ſheds, which are conſtructed in the <hi>Dutch</hi> colonies on the following plan:</p>
               <p>The <hi>Area</hi> of the ground generally applied to this uſe is ſeventy feet by thirty; a brick founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of four, five or ſix feet high, is firſt laid to raiſe the building from the ground; on this the building is placed of timber, being of two ſtories; the upper floor is about twelve feet above the lower; in each ſide of the building are from twelve to ſixteen large windows likewiſe two at each end, on each ſide of large doors, all this is neceſſary to give a free acceſs to the air, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the coffee from heating or ſhooting. In the lower part of the building a kind of drawers, of about ſix feet ſquare are ſo contrived as to be drawn without ſide the building, where they reſt on wooden rollers or blocks, theſe drawers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the coffee after the drying floor, and in fine weather are drawn out, but puſhed back the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it begins to rain; by this contrivance a large quantity is, as it were, inſtantly ſheltered from ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; no other invention can be ſo expeditious.</p>
               <p>The building muſt be furniſhed with two pieces of ſquare timber, of the length of twenty-five or thirty feet, and about eighteen, or twenty-four inches thick, made of hard wood; in theſe a row
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:014440_0187_0F9262E6E03550C8"/>
of mortars is ſunk, to beat the coffee in, peſtles or beatles for the ſame, fanning mills to clean the coffee, ſhovels for turning it often while it lies on the upper floor; a competent number of baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, of different ſizes, and a pair of ſcales with weights. Before this building there are generally one or two platforms, from forty to fifty feet ſquare, called drying floors, intended to take all benefit of the fine drying weather during the cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee harveſt. Adjoining to the building is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſmaller one, containing a cooper's ſhop and a mill, called a breaking mill, through which the new gathered coffee paſſes, to deprive the grain of its pulp, or red outer ſkin; after coming from this mill it is ſoaked during one night in water, and next day ſpred upon the drying floors, where it remains till the air and wind have ſufficiently dried it; if rain ſhould happen it is quickly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered into heaps, and covered with ſear cloth.</p>
               <p>The coffee, being thus dried, is put into the drawers, where it is left till thoroughly dry; from hence it is carried into the loft (being now only ſurrounded with a thin, ſemi-tranſparent huſk over each pair of ſeeds) where it is left till the whole crop is gathered; the harveſt laſting often two months; while it remains in the loft it muſt be daily turned, to prevent its heating, and in good weather all the air poſſible muſt be admitted; after harveſt it is again returned into the drawers, and left there for three or four days, in order to become totally dry, it is then pounded or beat in the above mortars by hand, to deprive it of the thin, inner huſk, which involves every pair of ſeeds; after this it is fanned, and when fanned the broken grains are ſeparated from the whole,
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:014440_0188_0F9262E72E652AB0"/>
which laſt are put in bales, or caſks, for the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, with all this ſeeming trouble a coffee walk is eaſier attended than a ſugar plantation, and is ſaid to be full as profitable.</p>
               <p n="46">XLVI. <hi>Cacao</hi> is a plant which i make no doubt would ſucceed in ſome of the lands found in the ſouthern diviſion of <hi>Eaſt-Florida,</hi> but as it is tender, and requires a deal of attention i ſhall only hint at it, as an object worth trying, and we ought to do this out of regard for our lives and conſtitutions; chocalate being become ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon an aliment, and the vilainous adulterations of it in the northern colonies, make it an enemy to the ſtomach, whereas if good and genuine it proves a very agreeable, nouriſhing and balſamic food.</p>

I cannot think this advice contrary to the intereſt of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> for whatever is beneficial to the colonies, will in the end be at leaſt equally ſo to the mother country.</p>
               <p>In hopes of ſome well minded planter taking this into conſideration, i have thus hinted at it, and will write what i can, from hear-ſay, of its cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Firſt then let me caution the attempter againſt impoſition; be ſure that you get the ſeeds in good order, and in their capſules, for the friend you employ may be deceived more in the plants than the ſeeds, there being a plant called by <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus, Camellia,</hi> and by <hi>Kaempfer, Tſubakki,</hi> ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly like to Tea in its leaves, as not to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed therefrom; this has frequently been ſold to the <hi>Europeans</hi> for Tea, and is thus introduced into <hi>Europe.</hi> If the ſeed cannot be procured in <hi>Europe,</hi> nor the real plant from a truſty friend, apply to ſome well-meaning Captain of an Eaſt Indiaman, no matter of what nation, he can get the ſeed in <hi>China,</hi> and it may be brought to <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> without any danger of decay, in a manner which I ſhall hereafter mention for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <p>The curing is done on iron plates, over a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate artificial fire, and the leaves are conſtantly rolled by the hand. <hi>Neuman</hi> thinks the dark co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and the roſe flavour of Bohea tea, to be arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial; he ſeems to ſay that <hi>Kaempfer</hi> and Dr. <hi>Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningham</hi> (when they wrote that Bohea tea was the firſt gathering) meant it to be a crop of leaves col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected before the plant comes to maturity, which is perhaps the caſe in the provinces of <hi>China</hi> that are too far north, to bring it to perfection: He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo mentions the proceſs related by one <hi>Meiſter,</hi> to wit, that the leaves are put into a hot kettle, juſt emptied of boiling water, and that in this they are kept cloſe, till they are cold, afterwards committed to the hot plates this produces Bohea tea; he adds, that this at leaſt is certain, that by a ſimilar proceſs good Bohea tea may be made among ourſelves; a ſpecimen of which he himſelf exhibited to a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous audience. He further ſays, ſome dealers in tea, in <hi>England</hi> are not ignorant that certain <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean</hi> leaves, particularly thoſe of the <hi>Dog Roſe,</hi> and <hi>Cherry tree</hi> may be ſo coloured as to paſs for good Bohea.

               <p>There is a later writer on this ſubject, i think Dr. <hi>I. C. Letſom,</hi> who is perhaps better informed, but i have not been able to conſult him: be all this as it may, let us introduce the plant, and we will diſcover its culture and curation.</p>

               <p>The bounteous hand of nature has here given us an animal, which, by experience, we know may eaſily be domeſticated, whoſe fine wooll might yield good profit, and whoſe fleſh is equal at leaſt to our beef, and yields as much tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; i mean the buffaloe: if inſtead of wantonly deſtroying this excellent beaſt, <hi>(for the ſake of perhaps his tongue only)</hi> we were to endeavour its domiciliation, either by a pure breed, or by raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſpurious one with him and our common cattle, i think we would find our account in it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mooſe,</hi> or <hi>American</hi> Elk, found in the higher latitudes on the river, naturally leads a life ſo nearly approaching to a ſtate of domeſtication, that i am often ſurprized he has never yet been attempted to be incorporated among the claſs of uſeful tame animals on this continent. Theſe and
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:014440_0196_0F9262EE4DA31E90"/>
the like hints i think deſerve attention, and i hope they may be of uſe. In a country where horſes and cattle are in ſuch abundance, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cheap, and where human labour is ſo dear, more improvements in machinery ought to be introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: it has amazed me often to ſee people ſo blindly mad as to ruin themſelves, by obſtinately perſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in building ſaw-mills in improper places, which has been here too often the caſe. The <hi>Miſſiſſippi</hi> indeed affords the means for mills at a ſmall expence, but they are only of temporary uſe. In ſuch a timber country as the <hi>Floridas,</hi> introduce the <hi>Dutch</hi> windmills, it is eaſily done; i have frequently heard, that they are unfit for this climate, but in my ſtricteſt inquiry not one reaſon appears againſt them, but that people by infatuation will run on a ſand, where ſo many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them have ſuffered ruin by making dams in improper places.</p>
               <p>As much as poſſible difuſe the hand hoe, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly at turning up, and otherwiſe preparing the ground for ſeed; introduce the plough; the neweſt lands may be plouged, and the hand hoe is only neceſſary to aſſiſt a little round the edges of ſtumps, &amp;c. introduce likewiſe the horſe hoe with the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Suffolk</hi> foot ploughs, to do the laborious work of the hoe in hilling corn up; in well improved grounds for rice uſe the drill plough, eſpecially in countries where an ox of four years old may be had for forty ſhillings, and a ſerviceable horſe for four pounds; all theſe would ſave great ſums, and render it leſs neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the planter to depend on the labour of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes.</p>
               <p>In lieu of the aukward tool made uſe of to cut
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:014440_0197_0F9262EECA565CC0"/>
grain, i mean the ſicle, i would adviſe the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the ſhort ſcythe and hook, called in <hi>New-York</hi> government <hi>ſegt</hi> and <hi>mat hook;</hi> and in caſe of thin crops the ſcythe and cradle: by means of theſe; expedition and neatneſs will become com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, whereas now the crop ſtands ſometimes on the field till it is damaged, unleſs a great number of ſlaves can be employed.</p>
               <p>Threſhing is performed in the moſt aukward manner imaginable, in the Southern colonies; to many the common flail is entirely unknown, and long poles, or a crooked cudgel made uſe of, and where the flail is uſed it is ill managed; for the large crops of rice, &amp;c, i would recommend a machine which i remember to have ſeen uſed in <hi>Holland,</hi> as long as my memory can ſerve, and yet ſtrange to tell, even in <hi>England</hi> the people were breaking their heads for the invention of a threſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing machine no longer than four years ago; when the ſame machine had been known, and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed in <hi>New-York</hi> and <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> near fifty years: it conſiſts of a wooden cone, whoſe baſe is about two feet, or two and and a half foot diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and whoſe length is from nine to twelve feet, it ſhould be made of very hard wood, its ſurface is regularly fluted, toothed, ribbed or indented; the ribs are about fifteen in number, with as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny grooves alternately between them, of about three inches thickneſs and depth; the ſmall end of this kind of roller is furniſhed with a ſtrong ragged eye-bolt and ring, and iron hoops to prevent its cracking, or the bolts drawing, this ring ſhould be about ſix inches diameter in the clear, and be fixed on a poſt in the middle of the floor, which for twelve or fourteen inches up ought to be caſed
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:014440_0198_0F9262EF6CC29670"/>
with iron, to prevent the ring from cutting it off by the continual friction: the ſheaves being laid circularly round this poſt, the roller is by one or two horſes or oxen drawn round in a conſtant circular proceſs, one man attending to turn up the ſtraw continually; this is more expeditious and cleanly than the trampling of it out with horſes and cattle, becauſe the thing is ſo contrived as to let the cattle walk without all, and it makes incomparably more diſpatch than the flail can even with many hands.</p>
               <p>In the common way of ſhelling <hi>maize</hi> there is alſo great loſs of time. A man can hardly ſhell ſix buſhels per day, whereas with the flail he will ſhell twenty in an hour, and the fanning mill will ſoon clean it; many more improvements will in time be wanting, but the above are now abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Thus far i have given a detail of the agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture practiſed, or practicable in thoſe climates; during the courſe of my collecting materials for this narrative, i have ſometimes been beyond all meaſure vexed, and at others i have been obliged to laugh at the ſilly notions, whereby <hi>England</hi> is deceived in her ideas of <hi>America,</hi> occaſioned by ſome fooliſh writers, who have raiſed ſome abſurd hypotheſis in their own brain, from whence they deduce as crooked <hi>theories</hi> as ever entered the thoughts of mankind; thus writing without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, they lead a parcel of blind copiers, as it were, in a ſtring, as if intended on purpoſe to deceive mankind; and what is more ſtrange, ſome people ſo implicitly believe theſe ingenious writers, that i have ſeen them after coming here obſtinately follow the precepts of theſe guides,

though in direct oppoſition to what they ſee to be the practice of their neighbours, who have been taught by experience. How ſillily has one vented an opinion, that by clearing the woods of <hi>North-America,</hi> we would ruin our temperate co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, and turn them into cold uninhabitable deſarts, thereby beſtowing the climates of <hi>New-England,</hi> on <hi>Carolina;</hi>

Under the head of ſugar in this work ſee more of this.</p>
               <p>Juſt ſuch nonſenſe he vends, when he attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes the want of wood in the plains of the north weſtern parts of <hi>America</hi> to barrenneſs, when experience has taught every one that they are fertile; how well does it confirm this genius's opinion when we ſee without deception, that the nearer we approach thoſe plains to the weſt, the more temperate is the climate! At <hi>Ilionois,</hi> in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude 40, ſnow ſeldom lays three days, and cattle are out all winter; in the <hi>Nadoueſſin</hi>'s country, latitude 45 and 46, above two thouſand miles from the Atlantic, ſnow rarely exceeds three inches in depth, and the wild rice is found ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous in amazing tracts. Nor is his argument of the cold being more felt in a field than in a wood of any force; let him remember that ſnow
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:014440_0200_0F9262F230B5D558"/>
lies a month, or even ſix weeks longer in a wood than in a field. This man dares to tell us <q>we talk from experience.</q> So it ſeems, when he ſays the badneſs of paſturage in the ſouthern co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies renders it impracticable to maintain ſtocks of cattle: was it my buſineſs i might enumerate more ſuch ſhining authors; <note n="†" place="bottom">There is one ſo very cunning as to have diſcovered the labour of our ſlaves here to be dearer than that of hired people.

               <p>In the above account i have inſerted ſome ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles which might poſſibly have come more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly under the head of manufacturing, ſuch as <hi>indigo, pitch, tar, turpentine,</hi> &amp;c. and even <hi>rice,</hi> but their near connection with tillage has made me inſert them there, rather than in the following part of this work, where i have dedicated ſome pages to hints concerning manufactures.</p>
               <p>Reducing the rough timber into boards is now the moſt common branch of buſineſs in the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern colonies, that comes under the name of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures: a pair of negro ſawyers are taxed to cut an hundred feet per diem, this the induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious ones often perform by two o'clock, or ſooner, they are then ſuffered to cut lumber for their own uſe the reſt of the day, or do any other buſineſs, for which their maſters pay them; theſe hundred feet <hi>per diem,</hi> are ſix hundred per week, or thirty-one thouſand two hundred <hi>per annum,</hi> which, allowing them to be only inch boards, and to ſell at ſix ſhillings ſterling per hundred, is £. 93,

12 <hi>
                     <abbr>s.</abbr> per annum,</hi> a noble benefit! which in thicker board, ſcantling, and ranging timber is much greater; the owner of ſuch a pair of ſlaves lets them out at £. 60 <hi>per annum;</hi> from hence we may gather how neceſſary the introduction of ſaw mills is to lower the price of this article.</p>
               <p>Hogſhead ſtaves of white oak are made by what are called gangs of people; a ſtave making gang conſiſts of five perſons, a feller of the tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, who cuts down the trees, two to croſs-cut them in proper lengths, a river or ſplitter, who rives them with the fro, and the fifth is employed in ſhaving them; this gang makes five hundred ſtaves each day, which are ſuppoſed to be worth 30 <abbr>
                     <hi>ſ.</hi>
                  </abbr> is 6 <hi>
                     <abbr>ſ.</abbr> per diem</hi> for each man.</p>
               <p>Shingles of cypreſs and white cedar, which are made nearly in the manner of ſtaves, are ſold at about 10 <abbr>
                     <hi>ſ.</hi>
                  </abbr> per thouſand, and one gang may very well make three or four thouſand per day.</p>
               <p>But the grand manufacture to be made of tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber here, is SHIPPING, for this purpoſe no country affords more or better wood; live oak, cedar, cypreſs, yellow pine, are adapted by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to this. O! how juſt is every <hi>Engliſhman</hi>'s reaſon for curſing the late peace-makers, when he reflects upon the fatal miſtake of leaving the iſle of <hi>New-Orleans</hi> in the hands of the <hi>French</hi> and conſequently of the <hi>Spaniards!</hi> and when he ſees them building ſuch fine frigates as they did laſt year on that iſland; to add to the misfortune they leave their own timber and cut it off of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> land, about the lakes, for preſent uſe; might not <hi>England</hi> herſelf infinitely rather build ſhips of war, and ſell them to her enemies, and ſo make profits of them, than to be obliged to behold this

with ſupineneſs? When we recollect the amazing diſtance into the heart of the country to which the <hi>Miſſiſſippi</hi> and its branches gives us acceſs, and where we may build ſhips of two hundred tons at leaſt; when we ſee the iron mines diſperſed up and down the country; when we recollect the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of producing the moſt immenſe quantities of hemp and flax; when we behold the more than rapid increaſe of mankind there; and finally when we ſurvey the harbours, <hi>Charlotte, Tampe, St. Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, Penſacola,</hi> all proper for the admiſſion of ſhips of rank, beſides others we know not yet; what a field is open here! what a proſpect of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and grandeur ſeems to be already welcoming us! no country had ever ſuch inexhauſtible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources; no empire had ever half ſo many advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages combining in its behalf: methinks i ſee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready the <hi>American</hi> fleets inhabiting the ocean, like cities in vicinity!</p>
               <p>The manufactory of iron will undoubtedly be very great here; every part of the weſtern pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince at leaſt abounds with it; no doubt other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals are hidden in the bowels of the earth, but except lead and antimony they are not yet found.</p>
               <p>The article of <hi>Potaſhes</hi> of various kinds have been mentioned under the head of <hi>Mangroves</hi> and <hi>Salſola;</hi> i ſhall only repeat here that no country can make theſe commodities equal to <hi>Eaſt Florida;</hi> that province can underſell and ſupply all others of the earth, when we conſider that <hi>England</hi> takes £. 50,000 ſterling worth out of <hi>North America</hi> alone, where people can not make it either ſo good or ſo cheap, it is ſpur enough to encourage ſome perſon to begin this manufactory in that country,

               <p>When we conſider the vaſt increaſe of ſtocks here, and the eaſe of maintaining a ſtock of a thouſand or fifteen hundred cattle, and four or five hundred horſes, and the very great difficulty attending the northern coloniſts in keeping up a ſtock even of no more than twenty or thirty head of black cattle, it muſt be evident, that tanning of leather will be a great buſineſs here; even al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the number of <hi>American</hi> inhabitants to be no more than three millions (which number the late ſyſtematic writers ſeem determined to confine us to) and allowing two and an half millions of theſe to wear about ſix pair of ſhoes per annum, and that in <hi>America</hi> about ten millions of theſe are annually made of <hi>American</hi> leather, which is more than likely to be the ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When we conſider that the northern inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants clothe at leaſt ſeven eights of themſelves with cloth, that coſts them hardly any thing, but their induſtry, when we ponder well the indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable pains taken by the <hi>Acadians,</hi> ſettled on the <hi>Miſſiſſippi,</hi> to array themſelves in every reſpect with the produce of their own fields, and the work of their own hands, when we ſee the immenſe quantity and variety of raw materials afforded by this country, ſuch as wool, cotton, ſilk, &amp;c. here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore enumerated, muſt we not be inſpired by the genius of frugality, to make uſe of theſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the bounteous hand of nature, and to imitate theſe induſtrious people, whom Providence already ſuffered to be driven out of the land of their fore-fathers by the iron rod of arbitrary <hi>Mars,</hi> and cauſed to ſettle in our neighbourhood?

               <p>Pork and beef will ſhortly be worth attending to on the <hi>Miſſiſſippi,</hi> as is evident from the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of ſalted wild beef, already exported by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to the <hi>Havannah.</hi>

as well as winter to rarity the air round the camp; always lay with your feet towards the fire, and you are out of danger of catching cold; if you are in a country where warring ſavages reſort, keep up a large fire all night, and be ſure to put ſome hats on po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es near the fire, this will protect you from their attempts, unleſs they are at war with ourſelves. A bear ſkin on the ground to protect you from its dampneſs is very neceſſary; always chooſe an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated ſpot, and if you have horſes chuſe a ſituation near a cane branch, or where the woods have been lately burnt, this will effectually prevent your beaſts from ſtraying. As the diet is generally roaſted meat remember my former caution againſt <hi>ſpits</hi> got out of a low ground; ſmall reeds are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently adapted to this purpoſe: a ſmall hut co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with tna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If you are where the graſs is long, burn a ſpace of ground before you make your fire, this will ſave your baggage, which many have loſt by neglecting this; if in a part of the country where muſketoes are plenty, have a cloſe covering, called in this country a <hi>Bère,</hi> and made in form of a muſke to net, to put up over your bed, ſuſpending it by two ſtakes; and laſtly encamp not near any old trees, but as much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſhelter your camp againſt the wind; by care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſerving theſe hints, you will not find tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling

through the <hi>American</hi> deſarts ſo uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable a buſineſs as it may generally appear to be; as for the dreadful ſtories told of wild beaſts, believe me they are vain, no animal is yet found in the <hi>North American</hi> wilderneſs ferocious enough to come within ſight of a man, if the wind wafts the air of a human body towards the brute; if it does not, he will not venture nearer than in ſight; but ſhould you wound a bear, or the <hi>American</hi> panther, ſo as to diſable him from flight, he will prove dangerous, but remember, if you tread even on a worm, he will turn up his tail at you, as it were in his own defence.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now ſay ſomething about the moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable method to be taken by emigrants, who intend to tranſplant themſelves into this part of <hi>America,</hi> from the more northern regions; firſt i would obſerve that if deſtined for <hi>Eaſt Florida,</hi> it is abſolutely neceſſary to carry at leaſt one year's proviſions in flour, maize, pork and beef; if to the eaſtern part of <hi>Weſt Florida,</hi> the ſame ſtep is to be taken; but if to the <hi>Miſſiſſippi,</hi> proviſions barely for the voyage will be ſufficient, they being always to be had there in plenty, at or nearly at the prices beforementioned; if the perſon be able i would adviſe him to purchaſe negroes in the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern provinces, and to carry a few more than he intends for his own uſe, the profits on the ſale of four or five will nearly defray his expences; car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry no white ſervants, unleſs you have a mind to colonize a large tract of land, and this has never yet turned to account; i will ſuppoſe two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of what in my opinion is the moſt elegible method of ſettling people of different ſituations in life.</p>

<pb n="210" facs="unknown:014440_0229_0F926312F72D80E8"/>
proſpects now apparently already open to us.</p>
               <p>Our timber trade is certainly capable of being
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:014440_0230_0F926314DC280200"/>
made incomparably greater than that of other countries together, as well in quantity as in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety: but care ſhould be taken that this trade ſhould be put under ſuch regulations as would prevent a waſte of timber, (ſuch as has been too fatally practiſed in the north of America,)<note n="*" place="bottom">For a ſmall inſtance, dog-wood is uſed as fire-wood in New-York; it is a hard fine grained timber, fit for many uſe, to much better purpoſes.</note> and at the ſame time make our timber by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per mode of manufacturing, anſwer the European markets, equally with thoſe of the Weſt-India iſlands, where the ſuperior quality of Weſt-Florida timber ſtands acknowledged without a rival. Nothing is wanting to effect this, but the erecting a number of ſawing-mills on the Dutch model, and the procuring a regularity of demand for the manufactured boards, &amp;c. As a proof that large quantities of timber may be brought down to our ſea-ſide ſettlements, I beg leave to relate the following inſtance; <hi>Monſ. de la Gauterais,</hi> formerly an officer in the ſervice of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, but now reſiding as a planter on Pearl-river, ſome years ago had the command of the garriſon of <hi>Tombechbé,</hi> during this tedious ſequeſtration from chriſtian inhabitants he thought
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:014440_0231_0F92631511E4C3C8"/>
of a ſcheme to turn this ſolitude to advantage; to effect this he employed ſeveral ſavages of the Chactaw nation in the cutting of cedar trees, and made thoſe of his little garriſon who were able and willing for a reward to do it, ſquare the timber, and form ſome of it into a very ſtrong frame of a houſe of about ſixty foot by twenty-five, which frame was next ſpring erected on an iſland or gravel bank, about two miles below the fort, and during the ſummer ſeaſon, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the waters, this frame was filled with the ſquared timber, which as effectually ſecured againſt removing. When he had this raft com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated, he got leave of abſence, and watched the time of the riſing waters, which at length took the raft away and him with four people upon it; this raft drew about 12 feet of water, and came down the river without let or hindrance, carrying before it every obſtacle (even bending large trees under it) all the way down to Mobile, and by ſome neglect even as far down the bay as the preſent fort Croftown; when thus we ſee that an enormous raft containing upwards of five hundred tuns of ſolid timber may be with facility brought down the <hi>Tombechbe,</hi> above three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles, what have we not a right to expect in the <hi>Miſſiſſipi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Naval ſtores are likewiſe an article of immenſe ſpeculation in both provinces; Weſt-Florida already ſupplies Spain with conſiderable quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; no province can ſo profitably furniſh Madeira with corn and pipe-ſtaves than Weſt-Florida, and in return ſupply itſelf and other provinces with wines: the above named fiſheries likewiſe may yield a very profitable commercial
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:014440_0232_0F9263160E217E20"/>
benefit. The trade for furs is a fifth article of importance, and is already very great; to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>rice, indigo, tobacco,</hi> &amp;c. would be ſuperfluous. But i have one material point to mention, i have often wondered at the ſtupidity of people let looſe in a certain part of the field of commerce: i mean the trade with the Spaniards, the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful appearance of which has led many into ruin, and yet intoxicates every one who is ſo unfortunate as to ſtray within its bounds to a degree of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The generality of traders this way, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der only the price of things as they formerly ſtood, and not that theſe articles are much fallen in their price on the Spaniſh coaſts; the danger attending this trade they deſpiſe, though it too often proves fatal; the delays on the coaſt are not ſo much as thought of, and the perfidy of the Spaniſh traders forgot; the underſelling by Dutch and French traders, although very real, is thought chimerical, and ſo on; in ſhort, the proſpect is here ſo gilded over, that nothing but profits appear, where nothing but certain and inevitable loſs can be expected, the fatal miſtake of over-ſtocking every part of America with European manufactures, is a kind of obligation, or rather compulſion on us to ſtrike out into ſuch pernicious branches of trade to the ruin of thoſe who are intereſted, as well here as in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. Be then adviſed, and let no vain hopes intoxicate you, have patience, and if you import goods from Europe with views of profit, import them in moderate quantities, unleſs long credit or abundance of money enable you to wait pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently for the arrival of the Spaniards on our own coaſt; and let none of our veſſels frequent
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:014440_0233_0F926317E4ABF468"/>
their coaſts except it be for the purpoſe of cutting fine timber and dye-wood, (and even theſe not often) or when you are very well ſecured by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue left in your hands for the veſſel to fetch a previouſly engaged, (but by no means by you) yet paid for cargo. Believe me, an American Spaniard will give you more for your goods at your own houſe than he will on his coaſt, and by coming to us he ſeems to looſe all his cunning, which in fact is only owing to our eagerneſs of compleating a voyage when we arrive on their coaſts. More branches of trade are not at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to be mentioned, becauſe none have as yet appeared in this country to be worth purſuing, but an immenſe variety muſt and will in the courſe of nature make their apperance.</p>
               <p>Having now explained my meaning in reſpect of the commercial intereſt of the country, i will ſay a few words on the benefits ariſing from the population of theſe and other ſimilar provinces It is an undoubted fact, which has been long ago taken notice of,<note n="*" place="bottom">By Sir Joſiah Child, in his diſcourſe on trade, p. 149.</note> that one man tranſplanted into the colonies creates work for four or five in the mother country; a late writer <note n="§" place="bottom">Dr. Campbell's conſiderations on the ſugar trade.</note> agrees with this in ſaying, that numbers of people who would have migrated to foreign countries, or done worſe, are, by coming here preſerved, and when become rich, return home. I muſt, however, differ in opinion from a third,<note n="†" place="bottom">Political eſſays, p. 359.</note> who has quoted both theſe, and expreſſes his opinion, by ſaying, that emigrants ought to be made ſettle where
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:014440_0234_0F9263181BDDAEA8"/>
they may be beneficial to Great-Britain; his ſaying would be juſt if a migration to the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern colonies was pernicious, but this is ſo far from being the caſe, that people there love room as much as any where; the continual and of late exceſſive importation of ſettlers into theſe colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies is an evident proof of this, for by means of theſe, even the natives are obliged to look out for habitations where they are more at liberty to encreaſe, not only the neceſſaries of life to which they are at preſent confined, but alſo profitable ſtaples for the mother country. A very ſtriking proof of this appears at preſent in every one of the northern colonies, though in none ſo much as in Connecticut, whoſe very hill-tops are inhabited full; thoſe migrations ought therefore to be encouraged, becauſe they will na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally find their way to the more favourable climates and ſoil of the ſouthern colonies. It is alſo the intereſt of the ſouthern colonies to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the migrations from the northward, for fear theſe laſt might by being confined within their prolific regions be in time induced to think of forming bodies of modern Goths and Vandals to over-run and invade the territories of their more happily ſituated ſouthern neighbours. I am therefore induced to think, that (however ſtrange it may appear that a people in one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty years time ſhould increaſe ſo rapidly as theſe have done) there is a neceſſity even now to enlarge their territories; in this i agree with the laſt quoted writer, and if Britain wants to ſecure the dependency of theſe colonies, it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely incumbent on her to allow this, contrary to ſome late ill judged ſchemes as this may
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:014440_0235_0F926318AD7B5B38"/>
appear. Can ſhe ſuppoſe that thoſe countries will remain unſettled? No, the proſpect is too fine, numbers of families have through the natural courſe of the increaſe of mankind ſettled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the lands intended lately for a new pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince on the Ohio: if i am rightly informed, no leſs than fifteen hundred families already, and many others on places not yet ſo much as thought of in Britain. Theſe are the people who are moſt likely to form independencies, and not the known provinces; what ideas have theſe people of the paltry fear of a war with a few ſavages, (for in the northern America they are but few) not that i would be thought to imagine that theſe laſt mentioned provinces would not ſtrike in with them in caſe of favourable oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities; what if ſome enterprizing genius among thoſe diſperſed inhabitants ſhould form an idea of becoming a great man, and by inſinuating himſelf among the moſt: weſtern tribes of ſavages (who never having had intercourſe with us, nor any other white people, ſuch for inſtance are the <hi>Nadoueſſins,</hi> who are ſaid to be a people remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably tractable) would incorporate a body of whites with them, and form combinations with other neighbouring nations, and thus form them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a regular ſtate. Such a ſtate would undoubtedly ſoon become formidable, and be daily increaſed by ſuch men as for want of room would leave the crouded provinces. Theſe, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them at firſt vagabonds, or little better, when they ſhould find themſelves in a place where they might poſſeſs the ſweets of life at eaſe, would find it their intereſt to become united with the common weal; therefore, i ſay again, that ſince
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:014440_0236_0F92631CE402EAF8"/>
for want of room, people to the number of at leaſt five hundred thouſand men, brought up to farming, are now without employ through lack of land, and therefore they are obliged to migrate,) and ſettle without the limits of the eſtabliſhed governments, and thus it is highly incumbent on Britain to enlarge thoſe limits, or form new provinces; a few paltry tribes of ſavages who retain the ancient grudge againſt us are no obſtacle; the emigrants will ſoon bear down thoſe melting remains of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who having loſt their country, cannot fail to hate us, on that account, and in a kind of deſpair will rather chooſe to be deſtroyed than to incorporate with us. Such bodies as above de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed being once formed, can any man in his ſenſes ſuppoſe, that poſſeſſed with the ſpirit and ideas of freedom, for which the Americans are ſo remarkable, they would after a courſe of thirty or forty years enjoyment of ſuch an independency be brought to ſubmit themſelves to any impoſed government? By no means; for not to mention their inacceſſibility, men, who thus by a regular train of accidents become maſters of a country by honeſt means, and improve it by robuſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, are not ſo eaſily diſlodged as we may imagine; hiſtory furniſhes abundance of inſtances of ſuch combinations of men, in a ſhort time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming formidable; and even in General Ogle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorpe's time a German with conceptions ſimilar to thoſe above named was found among the Creek ſavages, who, had he not engaged in his ſcheme intirely alone, and therefore by the Creeks, (although reluctantly) through the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral's importunity and intrigues betrayed into
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:014440_0237_0F92631EC0DD4C58"/>
his enemies hands, it would have been no wonder if ſuch a man, with ſuch ideas, joined to the amazing preſence of mind and intrepidity he is ſaid to have been poſſeſſed of. would have ſo neſtled himſelf in the ſouthern part of America, that we might have had no occaſion to think of forming the two provinces of Florida in 1763; and we may venture to affirm, that had not the ſettlement of Georgia, juſt at that criſis become the object of Britain's attention, he would have gone on unnoticed till he had formed all the neighbouring nations into a regular governed body, too ſtrong to be cruſhed by any power from abroad. But laying aſide this reaſoning, which i ſtill inſiſt upon is not only apparently probable, but may be looked upon as certainly to happen, unleſs the preſent bounds of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral provinces are enlarged; there are other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent reaſons to induce Britain to change her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in reſpect to this branch of her politicks, ſhe ought to let the Americans ſpread themſelves under regular governments over the continent, that they may be planters of ſtaples, and thereby find the means of employing more hands in the mother country, by obtaining from her ſuch of the neceſſaries of life as they find themſelves obliged to have from Europe, at an eaſier rate than they could procure them among themſelves. By ſuffering the upper latitude of the Miſſiſſippi, and the banks of the Ohio to be cultivated under the influence of a regular and civil government, we ſhall increaſe ſuch plenty of neceſſaries in the mother country, that all connection with foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers who have the balance of trade againſt Britain will become needleſs, any further than in ſelling

In caſe of a rupture with any power who ſhould think proper to attack the ſouthern provinces, eſpecially Weſt-Florida, would they not moſt naturally be ſupplied with proviſions, ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſoldiers by way of the river from thoſe ſettlements in the higher latitudes? nor is it on account of hemp and flax, &amp;c. alone, which may be ſaid to be ſtill objects of ſpeculation, we ſee the tobacco culture which is a branch of vaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to the revenue as it were daily moulder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away into its primitive non-exiſtence, and therefore new lands for this culture ought to be found and improved; the want of this ſupply of the revenue will ſoon be felt in the treaſury, and Britain will find too late that ſhe would have done well to have gone not only to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the eſtabliſhment of theſe new pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, but even to the expence of that tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous <hi>bug-bear,</hi> a <hi>war,</hi> with the remains of the ancient inimical tribes of ſavages; unleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſhe intended the proclamation of October 7, 1763, as a meer matter of form, and wiſhed the back ſettlements quietly to ſpread themſelves without any expence to the mother-country; but ſhould this be the caſe, the miſtakes of ſuch po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy I think are fully refuted in the foregoing

pages: the ſpreading of people over the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent will make them produce great quantities of ſtaples, and Britain hereby would ſecure a period for the dependance of the colonies upon her, while ſhe would have nothing to do but provide markets for the produce of the labour of her ſons. All Europe is ſenſible of this; every writer i meet with is either of my opinion, or abſurdly and continually contradicts and confutes his own maintenance of the contrary in his own writings: i beg leave, to quote a very ſenſible Frenchman (whoſe name I know not) on this ſubject, "it is true," ſays he, "that the free and happy ſituation of North-America, may much diſorder our Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean ſyſtems, <note n="*" place="bottom">The French word is <hi>Comb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Vaſt, fertile, and new tracts, where neither cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, taxes, nor military troops, will take place, becauſe they need fear no invaſion, will deſerve the moſt ſerious attention from all our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and policy will be obliged more than ever to turn all her views on the ſide of benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. Thoſe ſtates which will be lateſt in uſing this reflection, will find themſelves utterly inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of mending the evil; for the greatneſs of puniſhments or weight of ſlavery only ſerve to increaſe ill-blood." This is not the way to mend the matter, and i think certainly that no remedy will poſſibly be found out againſt ſuch a number of evils, as muſt neceſſarily attend the
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:014440_0241_0F92632648FB3D78"/>
keeping the colonies confined to their preſent bounds, whereas, by only allowing people to ſpread over the country, they will all be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally prevented.</p>
               <p>To give my reader an idea of what room there is yet left for people to plant themſelves, i muſt tell him, that between the latitudes of 31 to 46, which i judge to be the moſt habitable country from the Atlantic to the Pacific ocean, and which cannot fail by the courſe of nature to become the country of thoſe Americans who were originally planted from England, Holland, and France, and emigrated from Germany, on, and to the ſhores which bound the Atlantic weſtward, and who now generally ſpeak Engliſh; within theſe limits I ſay are contained no leſs than two thouſand one hundred and thirty-five millions, and forty thouſand ſquare acres, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive of the known waters; at leaſt twice as much as the vaſt empire of <hi>China</hi> is ſaid to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and allowing each family to poſſeſs fifty acres of land, there is room for forty two millions, ſeven hundred and eight families to live here. To conclude this diſcourſe on the ſettling of new provinces, i will juſt obſerve that the daily emigrations of the people beyond the frontiers, even at the riſque of the dreadful ſituation of being expoſed to ſavage incurſions, is the moſt evident proof of the neceſſity of this meaſure to the at preſent crouded Americans, if not to Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Likewiſe it is a proof how little the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Americans who inhabit the frontier coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries value ſo inſignificant a foe as the remains of the ancient inimical tribes of ſavages, or even the proſecutions in law of ſuper-intendants, their

delegates, and other formerly uſeful officers.</p>
               <p>To ſay a word or two about the political hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of theſe provinces, may be thought incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on me, but little can be ſaid of moment on that ſubject as yet; except that Major Ogilvie in taking poſſeſſion of the eaſtern province, by his impolitick behaviour cauſed all the Spaniards to remove to Havanna, which was a deadly wound to the province, never to be cured again, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the inviting means uſed by Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Grant, who ſucceeded him, to retain the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder, and to make them all return;—that Governor Grant uſed all poſſible means to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage indigo and rice planting;—that the crown would not allow the transfer of Spaniſh landed intereſt to be good, although mentioned in the articles of peace;—that the ſaid governor reigned ſupreme without controul, and in peace, notwithſtanding the frequent murmurs of the people, and the preſentments of the grand juries, occaſioned by his not calling an aſſembly, which they thought was a duty incumbent on him;— there was alſo a complaint of the contingent money of five thouſand pounds per annum, for ſeven years, not being ſo very viſibly expended on highways, bridges, ferries, and ſuch other neceſſary things as the people could have wiſhed; finally, Governor Grant departed the province for Britain in 1772, on account of his bad ſtate of health, having a pompous addreſs preſented to him by his council, which was re-echoed by a few of the inhabitants;—that he was ſucceeded by Major Moultrie as lieutenant-governor, who was again ſucceeded by Patrick Tonyn, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> as governor in chief, who enjoys the command
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:014440_0243_0F926327AFE9C710"/>
there now;—that in the northern extremity of the province at the mouth of St. Mary's river, a place is now founded, which, to all appearance, by its ſituation and ſuperior entrance into its har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour compared with St. Auguſtine, will draw the feat of government away from the latter;— that the cultivation of many articles, eſpecially indigo, begins to wear a pleaſing and promiſing aſpect.</p>
               <p>Concerning Weſt-Florida, i can only ſay, that diſcord has early made her appearance in the counſels of this province;—that diſaffection to Governor Johnſon has been the occaſion of its being ſo late as it was in rearing its head;— that Montfort Brown, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> ſucceeded him as commander in chief in quality of lieutenant-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, who was ſucceeded by — Elliot, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who unhappily ended his days; when the lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-governor again ſucceeded him, and was a ſecond time replaced by Governor-Cheſter, who is univerſally eſteemed, and under whoſe auſpices the province is in a thriving condition.</p>
               <p>About March 1772, the freeholders being met for the purpoſe of electing their repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, but finding that the writs mentioned a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the aſſembly for three years, (whereas they had heretofore held annual elections) they now added this condition to their votes, that the new elected members were to continue only one year; the mode of return on the writ the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor took ill, and refuſed to accept it, inſiſting that the members ſhould be returned for three years, but all in vain, the freeholders remained inflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible, and rather than not have annual elections, they choſe to remain without repreſentatives,
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:014440_0244_0F926329A53085E8"/>
which has been the caſe ever ſince. The ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this province goes on very rapidly, and its different valuable products increaſe a-pace.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now treat of a ſubject in which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs myſelf not to have ſo much ſkill as I could wiſh; i ſpeak of it from ſuch experience as my temper, inquiſitive into the myſteries of nature, has furniſhed me with during my ſtay in this country; i mean the diſeaſes moſt frequent in thoſe provinces. But by way of prologue, i ſhall enquire a little into the univerſally dreaded, though chimerical unhealthineſs of this climate.

Sudden and great alterations in the air, from intolerable heat, and chilling cold; this is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as ſoon as the ſun is ſet, and for the moſt part is accompanied with a very heavy dew, and ſhews an unhealthy ſwampy ſoil; this is perfectly the caſe on St. John's river, and about Naſſau-river, in Eaſt-Florida, likewiſe at Mobille, and Campbellton, in Weſt-Florida. At Penſacola, and from thence Eaſt: there is little or none of this perceivable; at Orleans, and on the Miſſiſſippi i was not ſenſible of any ſudden alterations of this kind: and on enquiry found it not to be generally complained of. Neither of thoſe provinces are ſo ſubject to this unhealthy variability as Georgia and Carolina, eſpecially the laſt; however, i do not find that any perſon need be much under un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs about this any where, not even a newly arrived European; the chief care neceſſary to ſuch at ſeaſons when theſe ſudden alterations take

place, is to avoid being expoſed to the night air, and after ſun ſet, to add ſome more clothes to thoſe worn in the day time; and if on a journey in the woods, never forget keeping a very large fire at night in order to rarify this dangerous air. His ſecond ſign is, thick noiſome fogs, ariſing chiefly after ſun-ſet, from the vallies, and more particularly from the mud, ſlime, and other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities; this i never perceived to a great degree in any part of theſe provinces; St. John's alone is very ſubject to thick naſty fogs of all kinds, the ſea-ſide where ſoft ſalt marſhes are frequent, is often troubled with theſe, and theſe marſhes a little before rain emit a moſt horrid, and to me a ſuffocating ſtench; the northern part of Eaſt-Florida is very full of theſe kind or marſhes, in Georgia and Carolina they cover a prodigious ſurface; the marſhes in the ſouth eaſt of Eaſt-Florida are of a different nature, and in Weſt-Florida i remember very few of this kind; i have, however, never heard any thing ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to a prevailing opinion of great ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brity in dwelling near, the ſea ſide, even among the thickeſt of theſe marſhes; nor have i ever heard any notice taken of the above ſtench by the inhabitants, except as being a certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of rain; where this kind of marſhes are ſituate in brackiſh water, the ſituation is beyond doubt very unhealthy, the wan complexion and miſerable mien of the generality of the inhabitants of ſuch diſtricts too plainly evinces it- We know by experience, that all ſuch fenny countries on every part of the earth labour under the ſame unhealthy calamity, but the comfort is, their areas are every where very ſmall when compared

with the more ſalutary ſituations which abound almoſt univerſally in every province, and in every climate.</p>
               <p>The third is, uncommon ſwarms of flies, gnats, and other inſects, which attend putrid air, and unhealthy places covered with wood; the firſt of theſe is not common here, except at indigo works; and if theſe, according to my former caution <note n="*" place="bottom">Page 139.</note> be a little remote from the dwelling, I never ſaw nor heard of any bad conſequences with regard to health attending them. I have already mentioned the bad effects of theſe voracious vermin on cattle of all kind at an indigo work; gnats, here called muſquitos, are vaſtly numerous in ſome ſpots, but after we have paſſed ſome diſtance the brackiſh waters in every river, they diminiſh, and at laſt we find none; the Miſſiſſippi however is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, but on this river they are not in ſuch plenty at the freſhes as below, at the <hi>rigolets,</hi> on pearl river, and at the <hi>Riviere aux Boeuſs,</hi> and on Dolphin-iſland, likewiſe in <hi>Santa-Roſa</hi> bay, and in the bays of St. Andrews, St. Joſephs, and at St. George's ſound and iſlands, they are intollerable, and all the ſea coaſt of both provinces is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly peſtered with them. I travelled acroſs the peninſula in 1769, in the months of June, July, Auguſt, and September, but found none at all in the interior part; i never heard theſe being attended by any fatal diſeaſe except their troubleſome bites, which ſometimes cauſe inflammations, eſpecially in the legs; but the inhabitants of the weſtern province ſo effectualy fortify themſelves againſt thoſe vermin with muſqueto nets, tents, and

               <p>His fourth, is the quick corruption of butcher's meat &amp;c. this, if the caſe at all in any of theſe provinces, is not common, i remember indeed to have heard a complaint of this happening at Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacola in 1765, which was a ſickly ſeaſon, but in all my journies through theſe provinces I never experienced it, on the contrary I could always by ſome means or other preſerve my veniſon, or beef, when there was a neceſſity for doing it.</p>
               <p>The fifth reaſon, ſays the Doctor, is a ſort of ſandy ſoil, among others he ſays, ſuch as that at Penſacola; i beg leave to inform the Doctor, that the ſand about Penſacola, and throughout theſe

provinces, is a coarſe, gritty and gravelly ſand of various colours, though chiefly red and white, that on this ſandy ſoil many excellent ſalubrious herbs grow, which ſerve as food to innumerable herds of cattle, and when cleared they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provable by culture; this is not the caſe with the hot ſandy deſarts of South-America, Africa, and Aſia, over which the <hi>ſamiel</hi> wind paſſes, nor do i believe that the oldeſt perſon in Florida remembers any ſudden, hot and ſuffocating guſts, or blaſts, from which he has ever been obliged to turn his face in order to draw breath; there are no open plains of ſand in North-America, they are all covered with trees rooted in the lower ſtrata of theſe ſandy tracts; the only plain of ſand i know without trees, is at, or near the head of St. Lucia, in Eaſt-Florida, which however is not extenſive, and to it numerous herds of roe-deer reſort during night from the adjacent woods; i think, therefore, that neither of the Floridas have any ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences to dread from their land winds; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, if we conſider, that the land-winds come from the weſt and north-weſt; geography will tell us, that they range over innumerable acres of oak land, conſequently clay ground,<note n="*" place="bottom">Excepting the few hommocks near the ſea, which are oak land, but moſt of them ſand.</note> and that only the ſea coaſts, and from twenty to about an hundred miles off, are any ways ſandy; which being ſo conſtantly fanned by the wholeſome ſea-breezes, (ſo remarkable in theſe provinces) could not have any fatal effects, even if the ground was of the nature of the Lybian deſarts; thus we ſee again how men reaſoning from mere theory, are liable to commit miſtakes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="unknown:014440_0249_0F92632D119C02C8"/>To treat of the diſeaſes to which the human frame is moſt liable here, in the ſame regular manner, as i believe i have done of every pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding article, i will divide them into two claſſes, viz. acute and chronic, and the firſt again into two orders, viz. thoſe of the ſummer, and thoſe of the winter.</p>
               <p>Fevers are the firſt of the ſummer diſeaſes; the ancients have ages ago made an obſervation, that the ſeaſon of the reign of this terrible diſorder was always preceeded by an atmoſphere laden with great heats, and much rain, for ſome time; the modern writers ſeem to me to be generally of the ſame opinion; this is exactly the caſe in all the ſouthern provinces; for fevers begin to take place in ſome diſtricts more, in ſome leſs, about the latter end of July, and in Auguſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue throughout September, and part of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, juſt the ſeaſon immediately ſucceeding our greateſt rains; and moſt violent heats; here i will notice a <note n="*" place="bottom">Inquiry concerning the cauſe of the peſtilence, and the diſeaſes in fleets and armies.

Thoſe diſtricts which lay near to low rice fields, particularly in back ſwamps) and to ſuch indigo works, where the planter is obliged to make reſervoirs of water, are moſt liable to theſe diſorders, after, and during the latter part of an exceſſive drought; becauſe in thoſe neighbourhoods the air is at ſuch times moſt prodigiouſly loaden with corrupt moiſt
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:014440_0250_0F92632DBB186718"/>
effluvia; for this ſame reaſon, cool rainy ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers will make thoſe places more healthy than dryer ſpots, becauſe during ſuch a ſeaſon all the above mentioned noxious exhalations do not take place in ſo great a degree, and the air is kept cool by the frequency of the ſhowers; however ſuch ſituations will never be ſo common in the Floridas as in Carolina or Georgia, the quantity of good wholeſome freſh running water being infinitely greater, and conſequently little neceſſity of making ſtagnating ponds or dams.</p>
               <p>It muſt be allowed, that all fevers however diſſimilar in appearance, proceed from the ſame origin; nature only works with more or leſs violence to rid herſelf of what is detrimental to her.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ephemera,</hi> or day fever, occaſioned by a meer increaſe of the velocity of the blood, by means of a fit of drunkenneſs, or debauch, or originating from violent exerciſe during the heat of the day is too frequently ſeen here; but as it is ſeldom of a longer continuance than eighteen or twenty hours, it has not often dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, and may be avoided by every perſon; i ſhall content myſelf with barely obſerving, that ſome cooling acidulated liquid aliments will ſoon abate its violence, bleeding may likewiſe be of uſe to reſtrain its force.</p>
               <p>The continual fever, or inflammatory fever, is ſometimes, though rarely experienced in this cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, but ſeldom attended by thoſe dreadful ſymptoms and fatality, which accompany the ſame kind of fever, though of a more violent claſs in the countries immediately between the tropics: this, in its common form laſts about ten
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:014440_0251_0F92632E7459CB60"/>
or twelve days, beginning to abate its violence in general after the ſeventh; the fourth or fifth is often fatal. I am perſuaded, that whenever the yellow fever has made its appearance in the Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridas, it was imported from Jamaica or Havan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah, as was the caſe in 1765, which (by the way) was almoſt univerſally an unhealthy <hi>Aera,</hi> as well in Europe as elſewhere. This continual fever begins with an exceſſive heat of the whole body, continued, though not violent head ach, great drought of the tongue and palate, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a continual deſire to drink; thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who die of this diſorder, generally depart on the fourth day, and i am of opinion, that few are carried off by it, except ſuch as are kept too cloſe confined from the freſh air: i would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the keeping the ſun out of the room, but to admit as much air as will gently ventilate it; a cooling diet, ſuch as rice gruel, barley wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, infuſions of baum, or ſage, and lemonade, which is lime juice, water, and very little ſugar; lime juice, ſyrup of lemons, and currant jelly ſhould moderately enter into every part or the patient's diet; avoid all ſalt, ſpices, ſpirituous liquors or generous wines; a gentle purge of glauber ſalt, with a few grains of <hi>kermes mineral,</hi> and ſome drops of oil of mint is generally given on the firſt appearance of the diſeaſe; the effects of this are forwarded by frequent draughts of warm chicken broth. During the operation of this, avoid all acids: bleeding (eſpecially if the diſeaſe makes a violent attack, and the patient is of a plethoric habit) is indiſpenſably neceſſary, the patient ought by all means to avoid motion, and notwithſtanding the above caution of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

air in the room, keep himſelf covered, and be careful not to throw his bed cloths a-ſide. If the ſymptoms abate after the above mixture, emetics are commonly ſubſcribed; if it ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, particularly if attended with <hi>delirium,</hi> le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargic ſymptoms, or their reverſe, bliſters are applied; and in great watchfulneſs ſome <hi>laudanum</hi> is uſed; if worms are ſuſpected, an infuſion of <note n="†" place="bottom">Lonicoera.</note>Indian pink root, (a very common plant here) leaves, wood, and all, is made uſe of as tea; but this plant poſſeſſing a pretty ſtrong narcotic qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ought to be uſed with caution: in exceſſive heats ſome grains of <hi>ſal nitri</hi> are added to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors adminiſtered to the patient, and as ſoon as the fever begins to abate, ſome orange, lime or lemon juice, ſaturated with ſalt of wormwood, is given by a ſmall tea-cup full every two hours.</p>
               <p>The yellow fever being ſometimes imported here, it may be neceſſary to deſcribe this <hi>Proteus</hi> among diſeaſes, which I have frequently ſeen, and which i myſelf have ſuffered in Jamaica under one of its various forms. I chuſe to follow the deſcription of <hi>Dr. Rouppe,</hi> in his <hi>de morb. navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant.</hi> as quoted by <hi>Dr. Lind,</hi> becauſe I find no other author who has done it ſo exactly, and if i had not ſeen his account i ſhould not perhaps have recollected half the ſymtoms he mentions, altho' i now perfectly remember to have ſeen that dire diſtemper in every ſhape he paints it in. He ſeems to ſpeak of it as an illneſs to which ſeamen only are ſubject in that climate <hi>(Curacoa;)</hi> he may have been induced to think ſo by the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not raging on ſhore; the florid complexion of

moſt of the people in the iſland ſufficiently ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be a very healthy ſpot; but i find by his deſcription, that it was the real yellow fever contracted at <hi>St. Euſtatius;</hi> he calls it the putrid colliquative or ſpotted fever; it raged in the Dutch ſhip of war Princeſs Carolina, on board of which this phyſician arrived at <hi>St. Euſtatius</hi> on the 1ſt of Auguſt, 1760, on the 11th they ſailed from thence for <hi>Curacoa,</hi> which harbour they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered on the 19th, and then (whether he means on the paſſage, or the very day he arrived, ſeems doubtful) twenty people were ſick, ſome of theſe had head-aches without fevers, and ſome were afflicted with a true bilious cholic; but they were by an eaſy cure again reſtored to the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their former health: the ſenſe of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the diſorder, i take to be as follows, viz.</p>

                  <p>In the beginning of our ſtay in the iſle of <hi>Curacoa,</hi> as before mentioned, the diſeaſes which occurred moſt frequently were head-aches and bilious cholics, which were ſoon cured; this changed into true choleric com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, gradually increaſing with pain much more dangerous than the former, wonderfully tormenting the patients: the diſorder begun with a very great burning heat about the <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia,</hi> (ſides of the upper part of the belly) griping ſtools, great anxiety and uneaſineſs, theſe were followed by bilious ſtools and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitings, with great loſs of ſtrength, many of them being bedewed with abundance of cold ſweat; if this continued, eſpecially if a fever came on, (which was the manner in which it ſeized ſome with a high pulſe, which continued in moſt about ten hours,) then the lips began
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:014440_0254_0F926331D4B24378"/>
to ſwell, and a ghaſtly paleneſs ſeized the face; afterwards, the fever abating, they vomited abundance of dark coloured blood; at this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod they generally died, or within a few hours after the appearance of theſe ſymptoms. Thoſe who voided the above named and ſome blacker matter by ſtool, emitted a terrible offenſive ſmell; but ſome of theſe were with difficulty cured; in the ſame manner it happened to thoſe, who ſuffering of the fever, had, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever no evacuation; others were only ſeized with a common bilious fever, and as much as i could judge, the major part of thoſe were young men, or middle aged, robuſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſickneſs the briſkeſt and moſt cheerful; they had a heat about the <hi>praecordium,</hi> they vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited bile, or were making attempts to vomit and had an unquenchable thirſt; ſome of theſe frequently found themſelves cold, and by turns heats would ſeize them; then ſucceeded a hot itching of the whole body, with a high, full, and quick pulſe; the tongue was yellowiſh or whitiſh- often encompaſſed with a green border on the edges, and always wet or moiſt.</p>
                  <p>The diſeaſe continued in ſome to the ſecond, in others to the third day; then the heat would abate of itſelf, and the natural pulſe returned ſuddenly or unawares, which by little and little would ſink, and at length become ſmall and tremulous, in ſome there appeared <hi>petechioe</hi> about the breaſt, arms, and inſide of the thighs; in others, large livid ſpots appeared; the ſtrength of ſome was by all this ſo exceedingly exhauſted, that on the leaſt motion, the patient would ſwoon; beſides an abundant ſweat would
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:014440_0255_0F92633230EAB868"/>
ariſe on the whole body; the patient moreover would be anxious, fretful, uneaſy, ſlightly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirious, very inattentive, valuing nothing, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of nothing, eluding queſtions, and yet at the ſame time almoſt always anſwering per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently to them; in ſome, upon the declining of the pulſe, a fiery heat would ariſe about the ſtomach, the lips ſwelling a little, the face be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ghaſtly, ſhortly after they vomited diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured matter, and at length died; others would be conſumed by heat and griping ſtools, and diſcharged corrupt, ſtinking, and almoſt black blood by ſtool; ſome in the third, and others in the fourth day, would begin to acquire a yellow tinge in the white of the eye, and on the ſkin, which was an evil ſign; moreover, the tongue would from day to day become whiter, and at length tremulous; they would always lay on their backs, thus as the diſeaſe increaſed, ſometimes on the ſecond, third, or at lateſt on the fourth day, an eaſy, calm death would follow.</p>
                  <p>Blood drawn from the veins, in the heat of the fever; was bright red: it concreted and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated a yellow <hi>ſerum,</hi> juſt as in Europe. Thoſe, who by meer dint of ſtrength reſiſted the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and reached the fifth or ſeventh day, would have the whole body almoſt covered with ſmall boils, or little painful red pimples, very difficult to be brought to a ſuppuration, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling ſmall pox of the confluent kind.</p>
                  <p>At length, moſt of the diſeaſed, particularly thoſe who had reached beyond thirty years of age, and were of a bad habit of body, when they were ſeized with the diſorder were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:014440_0256_0F926332F331C238"/>
with pain and heat about the ſtomach, with a continual retching, but yet bringing up little or nothing; in ſome the pulſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed for ſome hours, and again appeared in a ſhort time to be in its natural ſtate; it became low, the ſkin poſſeſſed its natural heat, the tongue was moiſt and white; on the firſt day of the diſeaſe a copious ſweat would break out over the whole body, but no ſpots appeared, thoſe whoſe ſweat was little or none, had copious black and very foetid diſcharges, were troubled with gripings, and would often faint away ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly; when the evacuations were trifling, ceaſed, or otherways remarkably leſſened, and but little ſweat pervaded; then the patients ſuffered greatly and were very reſtleſs; on the contrary, if it broke forth plentifully, they found themſelves much better.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, in all its ſtages from beginning to end they were afflicted with conſtant watchings.</p>
                  <p>A worthy lad about eighteen years old, who found himſelf well in the morning early, was, about 10 o'clock of the ſame morning taken with a head ach, and other feveriſh ſymptoms, he had a high full and quick pulſe, he obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately refuſed being blooded: the ſecond day at evening he voided abundance of dark diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured blood by vomit, and the third he died. Another of about ſixteen was well in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but we found him next morning ill, and utterly deprived of all ſenſe, i examined his body, which was ſwelled and overſpread with livid ſpots, his pulſe almoſt entirely gone; ſome black blood of a ſweetiſh taſte flowed from his left ear and out of his noſtrils, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:014440_0257_0F926333C2AC9DB8"/>
to ooze out ſome hours after his diſeaſe, the corpſe in a ſhort time became wholly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured and livid, emitting a very diſagreeable ſmell.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The French call this diſorder <hi>mal de Siam,</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it originally imported from thence into the iſlands; the Spaniards <hi>vomito preto,</hi> or black vomit; the Dutch <hi>geele koorts,</hi> which laſt conveys the ſame idea as the Engliſh yellow fever.</p>
               <p>In general, when fevers are violent, the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice which prevails at preſent, is to have recourſe to antimonial medicines, and as ſoon as a remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is brought about: the bark is adminiſtered in large doſes.</p>
               <p>Intermittents are endemial in all low ſituations, thus we ſee in all the provinces to the ſouthward, particular places remarkable for a continuance of this diſorder in them, ſuch as more eſpecially Jackſonburg, in South-Carolina, Savannah, in Georgia, Rolles-Town, and moſt of the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on St. John's, in Eaſt-Florida, at Campbell-town, near the mouth of the Eſcambe and at Mobile in Weſt-Florida; this diſeaſe attacks people much in the ſame form as the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued fever, the firſt fit frequently laſting three days without intermiſſion; phyſicians treat it nearly in the ſame manner as the laſt, but i have obſerved, that they are very averſe to taking blood from a patient afflicted with this diſorder, ſaying, that bleeding is a ſure way to prolong the diſeaſe, although ſometimes a ſmall matter of blood is taken from people of a very groſs habit of body, when the returning fits ſeemed to continue longer in point of time than at the firſt, the ſame diet is obſerved as in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:014440_0258_0F92633481573360"/>
fever, except when the patient is very weak, when ſtrong broths well ſeparated from the fat are frequently given; if delirious, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matoſe ſymptoms with pains in the back, &amp;c, make their appearance, cooling medicines are uſed, during the paroxyſms, Doctor James's powder or other antimonials, and on intermiſſion the bark in copious doſes is adminiſtered with ſucceſs, and in obſtinate head-aches recourſe is had to bliſters.</p>
               <p>This is a very tedious diſeaſe, and whoever is afflicted with it ſhould not too ſoon judge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf cured, but continue taking a bitter infuſion, compoſed of the bark of the root of the <hi>magnolia major</hi> (which the French on the Miſſiſſippi ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute in lieu of Jeſuit's bark) with Virginia heart, ſnake-root, rue, <hi>ſal abſynth:</hi> and pink root, in good Madeira or Liſbon wine.</p>
               <p>People in general, ſuppoſe them even obliged to remain on the ſickly ſpot during the fatal ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which is autumn, may by care, in a great meaſure ſhun this tedious illneſs, ſuch as living on a more generous diet, eſpecially animal food high ſeaſoned, and a moderate glaſs of wine; avoiding a too great expoſure to the then fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſudden changes of air. They ought to uſe the cold bath often, wear garlic and cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire in the pockets, not expoſe themſelves to rain, and above all keep warm and dry feet, and if got wet by rain not to change their clothes too ſuddenly; never go out of a morning faſting, but before you go to work, buſineſs, &amp;c. eat a piece of bread, and drink a glaſs of the bitter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; avoid the night air, and keep ſome fire in the houſe, particularly in the mornings and
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:014440_0259_0F9263352DBBA058"/>
evenings to rarify the damp air in the rooms, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in the bed rooms which ought never to be on a lower floor, and ſhould be in the eaſtern parts of the building expoſed to the morning ſun: by obſerving theſe rules the conſtitution of the human body will be leſs diſpoſed to receive the impreſſions of a bad air.</p>
               <p>An excellent thing to be given the negroes on a plantation before they go to work, is a wine glaſs full of the above bitter ingredients, and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic infuſed in rum; and they ſhould be encouraged to chew and ſmoke tobacco.</p>
               <p>When a perſon is ſeized with a fit of the ague, he ought by no means to delay going to bed, and drink a draught of lime juice, and powder of chalk, while it is fermenting in the glaſs; this will bring on a ſweat, and ſhorten the fit, or in the hot fit uſe ſome opiate if the patient is not delirious, this ought to be done as often as the paroxyſms return.</p>
               <p>The nervous fever, likewiſe called the ſlow fever, is known by a ſmall, quick and low pulſe, and by not affecting the patient with ſuch violent heats as the others fevers, but with greater op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion about the <hi>praecordium;</hi> it does not make them ſo thirſty; the tongue is at firſt unuſually moiſt, and looks white, though at laſt it becomes dry, and looks brown or inflamed; continual heats are felt in the palms of the hands, heats and chills return alternately very quick, a copious clammy weakening ſweat, exceſſive lowneſs of ſpirits, reſtleſsneſs, being drowſy without power of ſleeping, pain and giddineſs of the head, ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ears, and if it laſts long, the tendons are often affected with a ſort of cramp; deafneſs,
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:014440_0260_0F9263360D610898"/>
deliriums, continual lethargic fits; inſenſibility and ſtupor are the conſtant attendants of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order when in its laſt ſtages.</p>
               <p>This is a moſt treacherous diſorder, and by affecting the ſufferer with only ſlight ſymptoms of wearineſs and weakneſs, attended with frequent yawnings and ſtretchings, a ſlight giddineſs and loſs of appetite, and a great heat in the forehead, makes people neglect an early application to the phyſican, and thus they endanger themſelves much, though in people of a robuſt conſtitution who are much expoſed to the ſun, it will often appear for the firſt day or two with violent ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms; this fever will laſt ſometimes for twenty days or more without any apparent abatement; it generally attacks people who have been expoſed to unuſual fatigue, or ſuch as are naturally of a weak conſtitution. Vomits are the remedy to which recourſe is moſt uſually had in this diſorder.</p>
               <p>Phyſicians ſteadily, and almoſt totally avoid bleeding and purging, till after a free uſe of the <hi>Ipecacuana,</hi> and even then their cathartic preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are rarely any other than manna and ſalts, and after the gentle purges obtained by this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, they order a free uſe of rich chicken broth, and the above deſcribed juice of lemons ſaturated with <hi>ſal abſynth:</hi> this they generally continue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the diſeaſe changes into an intermittent fever, and then treat it in the manner laſt mentioned; frequently alſo applying bliſters.</p>
               <p>This fever more particularly than any other diſorder, bears hardeſt on the patient towards ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet. The diet commonly preſcribed is ſago, chicken broth and panado, with ſome ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of wine and loaf ſugar in the firſt and laſt;
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:014440_0261_0F926336C7C570E0"/>
infuſions of ſage and baum, together with wine whey, are the drink moſtly thought proper during the continuance of this diſorder.</p>
               <p>The uſe of bark is generally blamed as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of dropſy; jaundice, the ague cake,<note n="*" place="bottom">A hardneſs in the region of the ſpleen, one of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of long continued fevers, and by the Dutch Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oles diſtinguiſhed by this name, they call it in their own lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage <hi>

               <p>The above mentioned fevers and unuſual hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips in travelling, &amp;c. as well as exceſſes at plentiful tables full of variety, often bring on a ſevere bloody flux eſpecially in autumn, and if this makes its appearance with hard dry and bloody ſtools, the diſeaſe is dangerous; briſk purges and clyſters of Caſtile ſoap, and ſome of the hot ſeeds are uſed to expell theſe; when the deſired end is obtained, gentle emetics are called in; i have known people find great relief from a decoction of logwood and pomgranate ſkins, others again it would not help in the leaſt; a new honey comb incloſed in an apple ſcooped out, and then roaſted before the fire, has often proved a ſpeedy and very effectual remedy;

calcined hartſhorn, a nauſeous medicine, is non-ſenſe; bark of <hi>ſumach</hi> is a good medicine, but there being a dangerous kind, it ought to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by a ſkilful hand; the bark of the <hi>liqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dambar ſtyraciflua; aceris folio</hi> mentioned in page 20, together with the gum exuding from the ſame tree, is generally found efficacious; a wine glaſs full of the juice of lemons mixed with ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſalt has often proved a moſt excellent, ſafe, and general ſpecific; the frequent chewing of cinnamon and camomile flowers, eſpecially when a weak ſtomach vexes the patient, has a noble effect; avoid all vegetable food except rice, eat roaſted rather than boiled fleſh; ſalted beef need not to be avoided; uſe often veal, jellies and ſalop; uſe a great deal of muſtard; i know by the experience of many as well as my own, that Dr. Barry's obſervation of vegetables not being ſo eaſily aſſimilated as animal food, is in the ſtricteſt ſenſe univerſally true, and in an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate continuance of this diſorder, vegetables even our common wheaten bread are not at all digeſted, but moſt generally paſs through the body unaltered. When this diſeaſe changes into a chronic habitual flux, it will be neceſſary to uſe pills of equal parts of rhubarb and <hi>ipecacuana,</hi> mixed with ſome liquid opiate, and uſe weak lime water for common drink: if this does not prove a ſpecific, let the patient be removed to ſome other clime, for no remedy will affect that diſorder in the ſame climate, where it was origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally contracted, claret or port ought to be their conſtant drink in this diſeaſe, and ſpirituous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors ought by all means to be avoided; rum, a curſed bane of health and of ſociety; is too often

and indiſcriminately applied to every diſeaſe as an univerſal <hi>arcaum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>cholera morbus</hi> is likewiſe a conſequence of intemperate meals, and when it is not occaſioned by any food peculiarly repugnant to the ſtomach it often proves fatal.</p>
               <p>Debauch of every kind, particularly unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſitting up, is moſt frequently productive of ſome of the moſt dreadful diſorders, and exceſſive paſſions of the mind ſometimes produce the ſame effects.</p>
               <p>Exceſs in venery is generally productive of the moſt violent and obſtinate diſorders, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally inflammatory fevers, and obſtinate fluxes.</p>
               <p>There is a diſeaſe which the French call <hi>La Tytanoſe,</hi> which affects people in the weſtern parts of Florida, and will attack them with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious violence upon being wounded even in the ſlighteſt manner: if during the hot months a ſplinter be run into the fleſh, the patients are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked with violent contorſive ſpaſms, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally die in about eighteen or twenty hours.</p>
               <p>I never ſaw any perſon afflicted with this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſorder, but from the ſimilarity of the name with the latin <hi>Tetanus,</hi> and from my being told, that opium and camphire are much uſed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure relief, I take it to be the locked jaw, with which I ſaw a young man die at Mobile, Mr. Lind<note n="*" place="bottom">Hot Climates, ſecond edition, page 285—286.</note> recommends copious external applications of opium, and the cold bath; and gives ſome imperfect account of mercurial ointment having lately proved an efficacious remedy; the hint was perhaps neceſſary to be inſerted here.</p>

                  <hi>Angina Suffocativa,</hi> or the putrid ſore-throat, ſometimes appears here, this is a contagious di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, and rages in America moſtly among the youth; it generally begins with a ſlow fever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with great laſſitude and a low pulſe; this is ſucceeded by a ſore throat with white ſpots near the <hi>uvula,</hi> and if it be not immediately taken notice of, the patient ſoon becomes paſt hopes, and generally dies within 24 hours after the firſt ſevere attack of the fever; the phyſicians in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolina and Georgia preſcribe firſt mercurial purges, and order a gargle of borax, dragon's blood and Armenian bole in vinegar and honey; and the throat is anointed frequently by help of a feather, with a mixture of balſam of ſulphur, tincture of myrh, honey, loaf ſugar, and yolk of eggs; the principal part of the cure is to attend the diſeaſe early, the leaſt neglect being dangerous.</p>
               <p>The dry belly-ach is a very painful and torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſorder, though rarely fatal; it is occaſioned by cold damp lodgings, and being expoſed to the night air; but moſt frequently in all climates by an exceſſive uſe of the vegetable acid juices, which are all extremely aſtringent in their nature: and when this diſorder proceeds from too liberal an uſe of punch, rheumatic pains and paralytic affections of the nerves are its conſtant conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences and attendants, with loſs of the proper uſe of limbs: (often for life) the moſt uſual ſymptoms are the vomiting of bile, with the moſt obſtinate coſtive habit imaginable; and when ſtools are procured, the excrements are exceſſive hard, and in round balls like horſe dung: all this is attended with the moſt excruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating pain in the bowels, and a clammy ſweat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the method of cure is by adminiſtering emetics of the antimonial kind, which often alſo procure a ſtool; this is the only thing that can relieve the poor ſufferers; the warm ſteam of hot herb baths, clyſters of the <hi>tinct.

This kept me in a lax habit of body, and in about fourteen days i was enabled to purſue my ordinary avoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; camphire and opium enter into all the purgative preſcriptions i have ſeen ordered in this diſeaſe, by the phyſicians of the ſouth.</p>
               <p>There is an inſtantaneous fatal diſorder which the French call <hi>un coup de Soleil,</hi> i. e. literally, a ſtroke of the ſun; of this i remember one inſtance during my ſtay in Weſt-Florida, when it killed a child of about twelve years old on the ſpot between the hours of eleven and twelve in the forenoon, the time, as i am informed, in which it always takes place; by inſtantly applying cold water to the crown of the head, i am told, its fatality is prevented; likewiſe by cupping the crown of the head: what its ſymptoms are, i have not ſeen, but by the deſcriptions, i take it to be a fever, which ſo violently attacks the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, that it cauſes inſtant death. This diſorder oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs very ſeldom, and as it is ſo very eaſily guarded againſt, perſons who are attacked by it, are in a great meaſure blameable for their own misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, particularly if they know the country; the French, one and all, put a ſingle piece of clean writing paper between their hat and head during the hot months, to ward off the attacks of the <hi>coup de Soleil.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="248" facs="unknown:014440_0267_0F92633C10A133C0"/>Theſe are the diſeaſes, which occur during the hot ſeaſons; there is likewiſe a fever, in which the patient is continually affected with defluxions of the head: this appears in the late winter months, and during a wet ſpring; it is called a Catarrhal Fever: this diſeaſe is not frequent, but when it appears, it is generally treated like other fevers, except that bleeding is more freely uſed.</p>
               <p>The pleuriſy alſo makes its appearance ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in winter. Moderate or copious bleedings from the arm according to the degrees of violence of its attacks are immediately uſed: if looſeneſs and gripes attend the pain, blood is taken away often, and in ſmall quantities; the patient is kept moderately warm, and on no account ſuffered to uncover; the firſt medecine is commonly a cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purge; gentle ſudorifics are likewiſe admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtered; frequent hot baths for the feet are alſo preſcribed, but very cautiouſly applied for fear of his catching cold. After the operation of purges and ſudorifics, gentle antimonials are uſed, and a light eaſy digeſted diet, with infuſions of hyſſop, ſage, or baum, follow in courſe; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſwallowing of living wood-lice: and in caſe of coſtive ſymptoms, clyſters are uſed; on a continuance of the pain in the ſide, a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate bliſter or drawing plaiſter is put to the part; —much coughing, which cauſes a watchfulneſs, is removed by opiates: in feveriſh ſymptoms the diſeaſe is treated as the other fevers; ſpirituous liquors are to be avoided by all means.</p>
               <p>During ſome winters, a <hi>Peripneumony</hi> alſo viſits a few people here; the method of cure is the ſame as for the pleuriſy: it is ſaid to be more dangerous than the pleuriſy, particularly if co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:014440_0268_0F92633DD480EE90"/>
bleeding is not made uſe of as ſoon as the patient is affected. In this diſorder there is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally a freer acceſs of air allowed than in the laſt, and the patient kept almoſt in a ſitting po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture; it is ſaid that the ſteams of warm water drawn into the lungs in this diſeaſe, is a powerful help.</p>
               <p>A compound of the two laſt diſorders, called the <hi>Pleuro-peripneumony,</hi> is likewiſe ſometimes heard of, and is treated as the laſt.</p>
               <p>In Georgia i ſaw one or two inſtances of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order among blacks, to which the people give the odd name of the pleuriſy of the temple, of the forehead, of the eye, and ſo on; i am told they have a pleuriſy for every part of the head. It is violently acute, and, as i am informed, proves ſometimes fatal in ten or twelve hours time; if immediately on its attack, a quantity of blood is not drawn from the arm, for the reſt this diſeaſe is treated like a pleuriſy.</p>
               <p>The chronic diſeaſes are dropſies, conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, hemorrhoidal and habitual fluxes, relaxed and bilious habits of body, ruptures, worm-fevers, and among blacks the leproſy, elephan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaſis and body yaws; which laſt in Carolina is called the lame diſtemper; the firſt five of theſe are often beſt removed by a change of air, as the moſt efficacious medicines often prove of no uſe againſt the obſtinacy of the diſorders in the climate where they firſt originated.</p>
               <p>The dropſy moſt frequently ſeizes a patient after an obſtinate intermitting fever, where the uſe of the bark has been too long delayed: in this diſorder the ordinary preſcriptions in theſe countries is ſyrup of ſquills, and the common

A conſumptive habit of body. particularly where the cough is very obſtinate and frequent, and when bilious ſtools, with a great hardneſs of the lower belly affect the patient, or when a continual fever emaciates the poor ſufferer, he is in a dangerous way, and a remove to colder climates is hardly adviſeable; i have known ſuch people relieved by making frequent ſhort voyages to ſea in moderate cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates; but unleſs proper remedies are alſo made uſe of during theſe voyages, the fever returns almoſt directly on relanding; frequently after one or two of theſe voyages the patient feels him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf better; if he then retires to a milk diet, and freely indulges himſelf in fruits, utterly avoiding all manner of drugs or medicines, he may find relief, and even a return of conſtitution; fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent doſes of flour of brimſtone, and cooling the water he drinks with ſal nitre, are of uſe during this courſe: likewiſe the patient ought with the greateſt care to avoid exerciſe; the ſtiller he keeps himſelf the more hopes of recovery there is. The fever which attends this diſorder is of ſuch a nature, that here the uſe of the bark muſt be carefully ſhunned, as it has been during long practice, and by frequent experiments of very able phyſicians, found to be a ſure poiſon in this diſorder. The Spaniards wear the neſt of

In hardneſs of the belly in this diſorder moſt of the Creoles uſe hard and frequent rubbing it with a warm hand dipt in oil or hogs-lard, <hi>Quere</hi> bears oil being ſo very ſubtil and penetrating, would it not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable in rubbing?</p>
               <p>The <hi>haemorrhoidal</hi> flux is very frequent here, and was it not ſo very troubleſome an attendant, it would be looked upon as a beneficial event. Perſons who are attacked by it are generally certain of not falling into the more dangerous diſeaſes occaſioned by obſtructions of the <hi>Viſcera</hi> in hot climates; the greateſt danger attending it is that of the patient's falling into an habitual flux, which is a moſt tedious and troubleſome diſeaſe, and that although the patient has no other complaint but the frequent neceſſity of going to ſtool and is but ſeldom troubled with an involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary expulſion of the <hi>faeces;</hi> this diſeaſe is almoſt always a ſlow though ſure harbinger of death by its continuance for years, draining to the very laſt drop of moiſture from the ſufferer, who being left a meer ſkeleton, is as it were carried off in the manner of an expiring candle-ſnuff; yet thoſe perſons, who have been opened after death have been found with all the inward parts perfectly

ſound, and thus the faculty is left in the dark without any way to account for this diſorder; i have heard of people of a very robuſt conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with whom it has continued above twenty years; no diſeaſe is ſo frequent; it almoſt always attacks people who have ſuffered much from frequent ſickneſs or ſevere fatigue; and its obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy is ſuch, that it will yield to no remedy whatever in the climate where it originated; i have myſelf been attacked by it firſt in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Georgia, in conſequence of the great fatigue i underwent in my frequent long and weariſome journies by land; no aſtringent of any kind, not even the long uſe of rhubarb and <hi>ipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacuanha</hi> was of any the leaſt ſervice to me; vain was every medicine againſt this obſtinate malady; opium was recommended to me as a ſpecific; this i took at length in incredible doſes but the relief was only momentary; after the ſhort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieve obtained hereby it returned with tenfold violence and obſtinacy: if then i was unhappy enough to uſe opium during this attack it was of no uſe whatever, but obliged me for the next time to ſeek reſpite from a double doſe, the cold bath i found of ſome ſlight benefit and when i was at the proper ſeaſon in any part of Florida, where the coco-plumb <note n="*" place="bottom">Chryſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>An entire relaxation of the ſolids, and a bilious habit of body is another common affliction of thoſe, who have ſuffered much by the diſeaſes of hot climates; the conſtitution is in ſuch people ſo decayed, that it ſeems as if every moment would be that of diſſolution: the ſtomach is weak, their complexion is nearly that of a ſufferer by the jaundice, and hardly any food eſpecially greens and ſalads are found digeſtible; if the dry belly-ach has been their frequent attendant a paralytic contraction of the limbs is the final conſequence of that malady: others again will frequently vomit clear bile and be very coſtive having the <hi>abdomen</hi> exceeding hard; for all theſe complaints there is no better cure than a change of climate, and when the patient begins to feel any benefit from the difference of air while at ſea, i would recommend a plentiful and conſtant uſe of chamoemile flowers, chewing them in the ſame manner as people do tobacco; this, however diſagreeable to moſt palates at firſt, becomes in time as agreeable to the mouth as it is grateful to the ſtomach.

The uſe of <hi>Elixir Vitrioli</hi> in the quantity of fifteen or twenty drops taken every morning faſting and again an hour before dinner; and the moderate uſe of a glaſs of generous wine is not amiſs to ſuch ſufferers: animal food, eſpecially mutton, is the moſt ſuitable diet, and in caſe of an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate coſtiveneſs uſe the <hi>Elixir Aloes</hi> often at night or in the morning; the cold bath, eſpecially of ſalt water, is very beneficial to ſuch ſufferers.</p>
               <p>Ruptures are pretty much complained of on the banks of Miſſiſſippi; i have obſerved likewiſe that they are a good deal frequent in Georgia and in Carolina: what can be the cauſe of a diſorder of this kind being frequent i know not, but i find in a pamphlet which gives a ſuperficial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of South-Carolina the following way to account for it, <q>the obſtructed <hi>viſcera</hi> being ſwelled beyond their natural ſize, the inteſtines are too much confined, and by nature of the aliment and bad digeſtion being frequently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with wind, it is not to be wondered at, that they often paſs through the rings of the abdominal muſcles.</q>

               <p>The Worm fever which is common through all America, eſpecially from Pennſylvania ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, is not ſo common here as in Carolina, Georgia, &amp;c. the reaſon i take to be becauſe the ſweet potatoe is not ſo univerſally uſed for food here as elſewhere; children ſuffer moſt with it; though it ſometimes affects people of all ages. When a fever obſtinately withſtands all medicines it may almoſt be depended upon, that this obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy proceeds from worms; the ſtincking weed which is known by the name of Jeruſalem Oak, and in thoſe provinces is the moſt efficacious ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mifuge,

               <p>A loathſome diſeaſe appears ſome times among the Negroes after ſevere acute diſorders, eſpecially if the patient has been obliged to keep his bed long, likewiſe after a violent exerciſe has brought on a ſurfeit: this is called the <hi>Elephantiaſis</hi> from the ſwelling of the feet and legs; it is moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſeen to affect one leg only; in the firſt ſtages of this diſorder the patient becomes wretched through exceſſive laſſitudes which bring on an emaciation of the body, then the corrupted juices ſubſide into the leg or legs and feet, theſe ſwell, the ſkin becoming diſtended, ſhines and ſhews the diſtended veins every where below the knee; now the ſkin by degrees loſes its gloſs and becomes unequal and ſomething ſcaly; after this chaps make their appearance, the glands are ſtretched and the ſcales are daily enlarged, appearing as hard and callous as the hide of an Alligator, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding

               <p>No manner of oure has yet been found for this cruel diſorder, but the patients often live to a very advanced age under the preſſure of its yoke, even when it has been contracted in early youth; it is ſaid that the amputation of the affected limbs is no cure, for the diſeaſe will immediately attack the ſound leg; this i find alſo aſſerted by <hi>Hughes</hi> in his Natural Hiſtory of Barbados.</p>

               <p>The river St. Mary is the northernmoſt boundary of Eaſt Florida and by the Spaniards called Rio <hi>Santa Cecilia,</hi> and by the ſavages <hi>Thlathla Tla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kuphka,</hi> and is deſcribed in page 36; the ſoil here is not very fertile, unleſs it be at its very head, which reaches up to near the head of flint river, which laſt runs into the river <hi>Apalachicola,</hi> and this being the weſtern bounds of this province, we may in the preſent undetermined ſtate of theſe matters regard as the moſt natural limits of the province on the land ſide; from St. Mary's river's mouth there is a diſtance of fourteen miles along the beach of <hi>Amelia</hi> iſland to the mouth of Naſſau

river; this iſland is in general ſandy and hilly, but has ſome fertile ſpots on it capable of fine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, it is about two miles through in its broadeſt parts, which is the north end, and tapers away till it's ſouth end is ſcarce half a mile acroſs; here near the ſouth end was formerly a convent of Nuns and a church dedicated to St. Mary, whoſe name the iſland bore in the time of the Spaniards, but where were ſcarce any traces left of the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in 1770; weſt of its north end lay the Tyger iſlands, between which and <hi>Amelia</hi> there is a tolerable broad paſſage forming a convenient harbour, theſe iſlands conſiſt chiefly of marſh and pine hammocks; this paſſage continues through <hi>Amelia</hi> narrows into Naſſau river, and is frequented by ſuch crafts as exceed not four feet draught of water. The land on Naſſau river is almoſt all very fertile; the river originates not above thirty miles from the ſea, where it begins in many ſmall rivulets, which all joining very ſoon, by their confluence form a conſiderable large ſtream navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable for veſſels of ten feet draught up to its forks, this river formerly called Rio <hi>Sta.

               <p>We are now at the mouth of the river St. John, already in part deſcribed in page 34 and 35; this river called by the indians <hi>Ylacco,</hi> and by the Spaniards Rio <hi>St. Matheo o Picolato,</hi> runs from its mouth ſomething above twenty-four miles up nearly eaſt and weſt; at this diſtance up the ferry is kept: (commonly called the cow-ford from the multitude of cattle drove through here at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ſettlement by the Engliſh:) juſt above this ferry the river takes a bend and the direction of its courſe becomes parallel to the ocean; the general run of its water being from ſouth to north riſing at or near the latitude 27: and this ferry laying nearly in 30:10; near the latitude 28: it approaches the ſea within a mile, in ſo much, that ſome marſh and broken pine-land only ſeparates them: thus it makes a peninſula from hence to the above latitude 30:10. which peninſula is for the moſt part between twenty-five and twenty miles in breadth. This part of the country is the chief ſeat of the preſent improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and is for the moſt part too barren for planting; but excellent for the keeping of cattle and horſes, as the land chiefly conſiſts of pine-land and ſavannahs of the kind deſcribed in page 22; the ſwamps along the river (although their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance from the river deceived the firſt advent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urers,) are for the moſt part no more than an edging along its banks, hardly any where extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a quarter of a mile deep; the journal of Mr <hi>Bartram</hi> as publiſhed by Dr. <hi>Stork,</hi> may give <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

harbour is a perpetual obſtruction to St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine's becoming a place of any great trade, and alone is ſecurity enough againſt enemies; ſo that i ſee but little occaſion for ſo much fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the Spaniards had here, eſpecially as a little look out called <hi>Moſſa</hi> at a ſmall diſtance north of the town, proved ſufficient to repel general Oglethorpe with the moſt formidable armament ever intended againſt Auguſtine; however there was much more propriety in the Spaniards having a fort in the modern taſte of military architecture of a regular quadrangular form, with four baſtions, a wide ditch, a cover'd way, a glacis, a ravelin to defend the gate, places of arms and bomb-proofs with a caſemating all round &amp;c. &amp;c. for a defence againſt the ſavages, than there was in raiſing ſuch ſtupendous piles of building as the new barracks by the Engliſh, which are large enough to contain five regiments, when it is a matter of great doubt whether there will ever be a neceſſity to keep one whole regiment here; to mend this matter the great barrack was built with materials brought to Auguſtine from New York, far inferior in value to thoſe found on the ſpot; yet the freight alone amounted to more than their value when landed; ſo that people can hardly help thinking that the contrivers of all this having a ſum of money to throw away, found a neceſſity to fill ſome paraſite pockets, and judged the beſt method for doing this was to make contractors of the folks in view, as fifty men beſides the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants would defend this fort againſt the united bands of all the ſavages here; as a conſtant ſupply of proviſions can come by water, and no formid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able foreign force can ever be reaſonably expected
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:014440_0281_0F92634E0166FA70"/>
to come here, it makes us almoſt believe that all this ſhew is in vain, or at moſt, that the Engliſh were ſo much in dread of muſketos, that they thought a large army requiſite to drive off theſe formidable foes. To be ſerious, this fort and barracks add not a little to the beauty of the proſpect, but moſt good men will think with me that the money ſpent on this uſeleſs parade would have been better laid out on roads and ferries through the province, or if it muſt be in forts, why not at Penſacola? where there is a neceſſity to have a powerful force, and where the bar will admit a ſixty gun-ſhip: but i had almoſt forgot that the acts of Aſſembly there would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated the ſanguine expectations of Meſſrs. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractors.</p>
               <p>The town has by all writers till Dr. Stork's time been ſaid to lay at the foot of a hill; ſo far from truth is this, that it is almoſt ſurrounded by water, and the remains of the line drawn from the harbour to St. Sebaſtian's creek, a quarter of a mile to the north of the fort <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m which line ſtands a fortified gate called the barrier gate, is the only riſing ground near it; this line had a ditch, and its fortification was pretty regular; about a mile and a half beyond this are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of another fortified line, which had a kind of look out or advanced guard of ſtoccadoes at its weſtern extremity on St. Sebaſtian's creek; and fort Moſſa at its eaſt end; beſides theſe the town has been fortified with a ſlight but regular line of circumvallation and a ditch. The town is half a mile in length and its ſouthern line had two baſtions of ſtone, one of which (if not both) are broken down, and the materials uſed for the
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:014440_0282_0F92634EAD278260"/>
building of the foundation of the barracks; the ditch and parapet are planted with a ſpecies of agave, which by its points is well fitted to keep cattle out, and with that intention was uſed by the Spaniards for fences. Dr. Stork has raiſed this fence into a fortification againſt the ſavages and magnified it into <hi>Chevaux de frize.</hi> The town is very ill built, the ſtreets being all except one crooked and narrow. The date on one of the houſes i remember to be 1571; theſe are of ſtone, moſtly flat roofed, heavy and look badly. Till the arrival of the Engliſh neither glaſs windows nor chimneys were known here, the lower windows had all a projecting frame of wooden rails before them. On the 3d of January 1766, a froſt deſtroyed all the tropical productions in the country except the oranges; the Spaniards called this a judgement on the place, for being become the property of Hereticks, as they never had experienced the like. The Governor's houſe is a heavy unſightly pile, but well contrived for the climate; at its north weſt ſide it has a kind of tower to the height of which Governor Grant has added ſeveral feet; this ſerves as a look out. There were three ſuburbs in the time of the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iards, but all deſtroyed before my acquaintance with the place, except the church of the indian town to the north now converted into an hoſpital; (Dr. Stork ſays the ſteeple of this church is of good workmanſhip though built by the indians, neither of which aſſertions is true,) and the ſteeple of the German chapel to the weſt of the town like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe remains. The pariſh church in the town is a wretched building and now almoſt a heap of ruins; the parade before the Governor's houſe is nearly
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:014440_0283_0F92634F71E4C808"/>
in the middle of the town and has a very fine effect; there are two rows of orange trees planted by order of Governor Grant, which make a fine walk on each ſide of it: the ſandy ſtreets are hardened by lime and oyſter-ſhells; Dr. Stork ſays there were nine hundred houſes at the time of the Spaniſh evacuation, and three thouſand two hundred inhabitants; in my time there were not three hundred houſes and at moſt a thouſand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants; theſe, a few excepted, i found to be a kind of outcaſt and ſcum of the earth; to keep them ſuch, their ill form of government does not a little contribute. A letter from a friend, who lately returned from England, directed to me, dated 2 th May 1774, ſays, <q>this town is now truly become a heap of ruins, a fit receptacle for the wretches of inhabitants.</q>
               </p>
               <p>About eight miles north of the town is a tract of a conſiderable ſize, called the twelve mile ſwamp; which i take to be equal in goodneſs to any in America; this began to be cultivated in the year 1770. Three miles weſt from the town is another ſmall tract of tolerable land, called the three mile ſwamp; all beſides this within many miles is really a miſerable ſand, a dreary ſcrub ground, and boggy ſalt marſh, a few acres at the head of St. Sebaſtian's only excepted.</p>
               <p>The iſland <hi>St. Anaſtatio</hi> is ſituate oppoſite the town and forms the harbour, its north end being oppoſite to the ſouth end of the narrow peninſula made by the north river: this is the only part of all the lands purchaſed by the worthy Mr. Fiſh, for the debts due to him by the Spaniards, which he was allowed to keep, notwithſtanding the treaty allowed it him; for no ſale was judged valid if
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:014440_0284_0F92635057D01D78"/>
made by him, unleſs the government afterwards gave a grant, but this was one of the many ways to make offices worthy of holding; the above named gentleman has a pretty retreat on this iſland, about four miles from town; but as the land is barren it is more pleaſant than profitable. The ſound which divides this iſland from the main, is called <hi>Matauca</hi> river, it is about twenty miles in length; the iſland affords paſturage for numerous herds of horſes and ſome cattle, the firſt in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular breed kindly here; about half a mile from the north end of the iſland is a heavy ſtone build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſerving for a look out; a ſmall detachment of troops is kept here, and by ſignals from hence, the inhabitants are given to underſtand what kind of, and how many veſſels are approaching the harbour, either from the north or from the ſouth; in the year 1770 fifty feet of timber frame work was added to its former height, as was likewiſe a maſt or flagſtaff forty ſeven feet long, but this laſt proving too weighty, endangered the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and was ſoon taken down. In this iſland are quarries of a kind of concreted petrified ſhells, or a ſtone bearing their reſemblance, this will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed hereafter.</p>
               <p>About two miles ſouth of the town is the mouth of St. Sebaſtian's river already mentioned, this is a ſmall creek riſing near ſix miles north of the town, but its ſtream ſoon becomes ſalt by the meeting of the waters from below; veſſels go two miles and a half up it to clean. A bridge was built over it to the weſt of the town, which ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened the road into the country near ſeven miles, but the great depth of the water joined to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtability of the bottom did not ſuffer it to remain
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:014440_0285_0F926350F24FE9D0"/>
long, and a ferry is now eſtabliſhed in its room; the keeper of the ferry has £ 50 ſterl. <hi>per annum</hi> allowed him, and the inhabitants pay nothing for croſſing except after dark.</p>
               <p>We next meet the mouth of St. Nicholas creek, on the point to the north of which the firſt town was built by the Spaniards, but they ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved it for conveniency's ſake to its preſent ſite: on the ſouth point is a plantation belonging to Mr. <hi>Moultrie</hi> the preſent Lieutenant Governor; this place is remarkable for a large oyſter bank being entirely eat out by this gentleman's negroes in a ſcarce ſeaſon. This river is ſhort originating about ten miles to the weſt of the ſound, and has no fertile land on or near it.</p>
               <p>Six miles further ſouth, or about ten miles from town is the mouth of <hi>Sta. Cecilia,</hi> another ſmall river of little note. Between nine and ten miles further is the look out or fort of <hi>Matanca,</hi> on a marſhy iſland, commanding the entrance of <hi>Matanca,</hi> which lays oppoſite to it; this fort is to be ſeen at the diſtance of about five leagues, it is of very little ſtrength, nor need it be otherwiſe, as there is ſcarce eight feet water at the beſt of times on this bar: the Spaniards kept a Lieuten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant's command here; the Engliſh a Serjeant's. Between two or three miles from this inlet or bar is another of ſtill leſs note, called <hi>el Penon;</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and ſouthward is the mouth of a river called <hi>North Weſt,</hi> i ſuppoſe from the direction of the courſe we go up it; it is ſomewhat more conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than the two or three laſt mentioned; ſome ſettlements are near its banks, but of ſmall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, the land being in general arid and poor. Three miles further ſouth is the upper end of the
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:014440_0286_0F926351B526F6D0"/>
water which by former Geographers has been ſtiled a river; the Spaniards called it <hi>Rio Muſketo,</hi> and the Engliſh the Muſketo river: <hi>Mr. de Brahm</hi> has changed the name of it into <hi>Halifax</hi> river. This pretended river is one of thoſe arms of the ſea commonly called a <hi>Lagoon;</hi> thus i believe the wonder of Dr. Stork's two rivers, lying parrallel to each other and the ocean, and yet running di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite courſes is well accounted for, ſuch <hi>Lagoons</hi> being not at all uncommon: the upper part of this piece of water is a kind of lake or pond, and is removed at ſo inconſiderable a diſtance from the ſea, that boats which were obliged to go outſide at <hi>Penon,</hi> where the inland navigation ceaſes, are here drawn out of the ſea into this <hi>lagoon.</hi> I believe the firſt rocks to be ſeen on the beach of the coaſt of America, from Long-Iſland to this place are to be ſeen here; they are of that kind which ſeems to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of ſhells; they are ſmall and do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend far into the water, but are as it were buried in the ſand at low water mark.</p>
               <p>About twenty miles ſouth is the mouth of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moco</hi> creek, falling into this <hi>lagoon</hi> from the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; the head of this is at a ſmall diſtance from St. John's river; it is ſaid that ſome good land lays along its banks.</p>
               <p>Thirty two miles further ſouth is the mouth of another river, called <hi>ſpruce creek;</hi> it is very rich in freſh marſh, the ground being greatly broken at its mouth; this is a more conſiderable ſtream than the laſt, and at a little diſtance from this mouth are the firſt ſettlements of <hi>Muſketo</hi> or <hi>New Smyrna,</hi> particularly <hi>Mr. Penman</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>Between three and four miles further ſouth is
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:014440_0287_0F9261C5D54C0E90"/>
the entrance, or bar of <hi>New Smyrna</hi> of ſtill leſs navigable convenience than St. Auguſtine, and is the outwatering of the above named <hi>lagoon</hi> as likewiſe of another coming from the ſouth ſtiled <hi>North Hillſborough river;</hi> here we begin to ſee a few of the tropical plants, ſuch as <hi>carica, boraſſus, capſicum, mangles</hi> and <hi>blackwood.</hi> At a few miles from the bar is the ſituation of the town or ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made by Dr. Turnbull for Sir William Duncan, himſelf, and perhaps more aſſociates; this town is called <hi>New Smyrna,</hi> from the place of the Doctor's lady's nativity. The ſettlements round this famous town extend conſiderably along the banks of this <hi>lagoon,</hi> and large quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of very good indigo have been made here. If my reader is inquiſitive to know why i call this <hi>famous,</hi> i anſwer on account of the cruel methods uſed in ſettling it, which made it the daily topic of converſation for a long time in this and the neighbouring provinces.</p>
               <p>About 1500 people, men, women and child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren were deluded away from their native country, where they lived at home in the plentiful corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields and vineyards of Greece and Italy, to this place, where inſtead of plenty they found want in its laſt degree, inſtead of promiſed fields, a dreary wilderneſs; inſtead of a grateful fertile ſoil, a barren arid ſand; and in addition to their miſery, were obliged to indent themſelves, their wives, and children for many years, to a man who had the moſt ſanguine expectations of tranſplanting <hi>Baſhawſhip</hi> from the Levant. The better to effect his purpoſe, he granted them a pitiful por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of land for ten years, upon the plan of the fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Many were denied even ſuch grants as theſe, and were obliged to work in the manner of negroes, a taſk in the field; their proviſions were at the beſt of times only a quart of maize per day, and two ounces of pork per week; this might have ſufficed with the help of fiſh which a bounds in this <hi>lagoon,</hi> but they were denied the liberty of fiſhing, and leſt they ſhould not labour enough, inhuman taſk-maſters were ſet over them, and inſtead of allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each family to do with their homely fare as they pleaſed, they were forced to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Maſters of veſſels were forewarned from giving any of them a piece of bread or meat. Imagine to yourſelf an African (an expert hunter) who had been long the favorite of his maſter, through the importunities of this petty tyrant ſold to him,—imagine to yourſelf one of a claſs of men, whoſe hearts are generally callous againſt the ſofter feelings, melted with the wants of ſome of theſe wretches, giving them a piece of his veniſon, of which he caught what he pleaſed, and for this charitable act diſgraced, whipped, and in courſe of time uſed ſo ſeverely that the unuſual ſervitude ſoon releaſed him to a happier ſtate; again, behold a man obliged to whip

his own wife in public, for pilfering bread to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve her helpleſs family; then think of a time when the above ſmall allowance was reduced to half, and ſee ſome brave generous ſeamen charit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſharing their own allowance with ſome of theſe wretches, the merciful tars ſuffering abuſe for their generoſity, and the miſerable objects of their ill-timed pity, undergoing bodily puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for ſatisfying the cravings of a long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed appetite, and you may form ſome judgement of the manner in which New Smyrna was ſettled. Mr. Joſeph Purcell, an excellent young man, who was draughtſman to our depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a Minorquin, who with his family came over at the ſame time with theſe people, but happily withdrew from the yoke, could never ſpeak of this without tears; he had been ſeveral times an eye witneſs to this diſtreſs, and told me, that he knew many among the unhappy ſufferers who were comfortably eſtabliſhed in Europe, but by great promiſes deluded away; and O Florida! were this the only inſtance of ſimilar barbarity which thou haſt ſeen, we might draw a veil over theſe ſcenes of horror; but Rolles Town, Mount Royal, and three or four others of leſs note have ſeen too many wretches fall victims to hunger and ill uſage, and that at a period of life when health and ſtrength generally maintain the human frame in its greateſt vigour, and ſeem to inſure longevity. Rolles-Town in particular has been the ſepulchre of above four hundred ſuch victims. Before i leave this ſubject, i will relate the inſurrection to which thoſe unhappy people at <hi>New Smyrna</hi> were obliged to have recourſe, and which the great ones ſtiled rebellion. In the year 1769, at
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:014440_0290_0F9261C92FD3FCF0"/>
a time when the unparalleled ſeverities of their taſk-maſters, particularly one <hi>Cutter</hi> (who had been made a juſtice of the peace, with no other view than to enable him to execute his bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barities in a large extent, and with the greater ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of authority) had drove theſe wretches to deſpair, they reſolved to eſcape to the <hi>Havan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah;</hi> to execute this, they broke into the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſtores, and ſeized on ſome craft lying in the harbour, but were prevented from taking others by the care of the maſters. Deſtitute of any man fit for the important poſt of a leader, their proceedings were all confuſion, and an Italian of very bad principles, who was accuſed of a rape on a very young girl, but of ſo much note, that he had formerly been admitted to the overſeer's table, aſſumed a kind of command; they thought themſelves ſecure where they were, and this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned a delay, 'till a detachment of the ninth regiment had time to arrive, to whom they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, except one boat full, which eſcaped to the Florida Keys; but was taken up by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence-man: many were the victims deſtined to puniſhment; as i was one of the grand jury which at fifteen days on this buſineſs, i had an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of canvaſſing it well, but the accuſations were of ſo ſmall account that we found only five bills; one of theſe was againſt a man for maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the above ſaid Cutter, whom, it ſeems, they had pitched upon as the principal object of their reſentment, and curtailed his ear, and two of his fingers;—another for ſhooting a cow, which being a capital crime in England, the law making it ſuch was here extended to this Province; the others were againſt the leader, and three more, for
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:014440_0291_0F9261C975E48240"/>
the burglary committed on the proviſion ſtore; the diſtreſſes of the ſufferers touched us ſo, that we almoſt unanimouſly wiſhed for ſome happy circumſtances that might juſtify our rejecting all the bills, except that againſt the chief, who was a villain. One man was brought before us three or four times, and at laſt was joined in one accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the perſon who maimed Cutter; yet no evidence of weight appearing againſt him, I had an opportunity to remark by the appearance of ſome faces in court, that he had been marked, and that the grand jury diſappointed the expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of more than one great man. Governor Grant pardoned two, and a third who was oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the executioner of the remaining two. On this occaſion I ſaw one of the moſt moving ſcenes I ever experienced; long and obſtinate was the ſtruggle of this man's mind, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly called out, that he choſe to die rather than be the executioner of his friends in diſtreſs: this not a little perplexed Mr. <hi>Woolridge,</hi> the ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff, till at length the entreaties of the victims themſelves, put an end to the conflict in his breaſt, by encouraging him to the act. Now we beheld a man thus compelled to mount the ladder, take leave of his friends in the moſt moving manner, kiſſing them the moment before he committed them to an ignominious death. I have dwelt the longer on this ſubject, becauſe the native preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of vulgar Engliſhmen, has repreſented the misfortunes of theſe wretches in too black a light. It is ſaid that Dr. Stork, who was near the ſpot when the inſurrection happened, died with the fright, and Cutter ſome time after died a lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering death, having experienced, beſides his
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:014440_0292_0F9261CA312A1710"/>
wounds, the terrors of a coward in power, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by vengeance.</p>
               <p>To return to our <hi>topographical</hi> account:—along this ſouthern lagoon, which extends itſelf for about forty miles to <hi>Cape Cannaveral,</hi> in the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of 28 degrees and a half, we find ſeveral ſettlements of good note, among which that of Captain Rogers is the moſt meridional habitation on the Britiſh continent. At <hi>Cape Cannaveral</hi> is ſome good plantable land, and here is the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern head of this lagoon; about two miles and an half to the weſtward thereof is the head or northern end of another branch, likewiſe called a river; a road is cut to draw boats out of the Muſketo Lagoon into this, which is called <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hillſborough,</hi> by <hi>De Braham,</hi> but commonly called <hi>Indian River;</hi> the ſavages call it <hi>Aiſa Hatcha,</hi> i.e. Deer River, although the ſame elegant <hi>Lexipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> has made it <hi>Hyſweeſlake;</hi> a word by him fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricated, as I ſuppoſe, from <hi>Ylacco,</hi> the name given by the ſavages to St. John's River; the Spaniards call it <hi>Reo d'aïs.</hi> No rivers of any no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A hired Frenchman, fortunately eſcaped, by hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſteered half a point more eaſt than the others. The people employed in the courſe of our ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey, while walking the ſtrand, after ſtrong eaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern gales, have repeatedly found piſtareens and
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:014440_0293_0F9261CAF7D267C0"/>
double piſtareens, which kinds of money pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably yet remaining in the wrecks, are ſometimes waſhed up by the ſurf in hard winds.

The banks of this lagoon are not fruitful.</p>
               <p>Having now exceeded the latitude 28, to the ſouthward, i ſhall here break off from the ſea-coaſt, and reſume the deſcription of the interior country from that latitude; being, as before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, the ſouth-end of the peninſula, made by St. John's River and the ſea. This ſouthern end a mere point of marſh, with ſome broken pine land in it, not much above three quarters of a mile wide, dividing the freſh water of St. John, from the ſalt of <hi>Aiſa hatcha:</hi> imagine then to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a country gradually riſing into a ridge of highland, very barren, ſandy and gravelly, a few places excepted, interſected with abundance of rivulets, and variegated with ponds and lakes, whoſe banks being in general lined with oak <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolia,</hi> and other trees, exhibit the moſt romantic ſcene imaginable, and you will have a juſt idea of this place. We frequently meet with ſpacious ſavannahs of the high kind; the country is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with roe deer and turkies, the lakes ſtocked with fiſh, and thus it continues in a due weſt line acroſs the Mexican gulph to the ſaid latitude 28, which ſtrikes ſaid gulph 15 m. northward of the bay of <hi>Spiritu Santo.</hi> As we go northerly the fertile ſpots become more frequent, till we come to that part of the province formerly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by the Spaniards: here we find along the

road from <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to <hi>Apalachia,</hi> the remains, or ruins of the following forts and towns, viz. on each ſide of <hi>St. John's;</hi> fort <hi>Picolata, Popa,</hi> and about ſeventy miles W. N. W. of <hi>Popa,</hi> we meet with <hi>Alachua, Puebla nova Navala, Santa Fe,</hi> in a very fertile region, <hi>Utoca, St. Pedro,</hi> and <hi>St. Matheo</hi> in a leſs favourable ſoil; then ſome ſmall remains of <hi>Ayovola;</hi> next the fort <hi>St. Mark's</hi> in pine barren, all which are ſtill marked (even in late maps) though not now inhabited; in this part of the country, eſpecially at <hi>Alachua,</hi> an hundred miles N. W. from <hi>Auguſtine;</hi> the ground is fertile in a high degree, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues northward, to the extent of the province. Near <hi>Santa Fé</hi> is a river of the ſame name, which, by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> is corruptly called <hi>St. Taffy</hi>'s; this river, after a conſiderable courſe, loſes itſelf under ground, and the geography is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently known to acquaint us whether it emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges again or not. This i reckon one of the chief curioſities of this province. We next met with very great holes, fifty or ſixty feet deep, and thirty or forty feet in diameter at the ſurface, in the higheſt part of the pine ridges, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford ſome good water to the thirſty traveller, there being no other water in thoſe ridges. I came acroſs the peninſula in a dry ſeaſon, and we were five days without water, becauſe we travelled over the ridge almoſt in its longitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal direction, and ſaw but few of theſe holes; (in the ſouthern latitude of 28 and 29, in which i was then) even theſe we found dry; but i did not know, at that time, their nature, which i afterwards found. My guide informed me, that in the road from <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to <hi>Apalachia,</hi> in a ſimilar
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:014440_0295_0F9261CEC6B577E0"/>
ſeaſon, he had been obliged to ſuffer a long thirſt, and at laſt came to one of theſe holes, in which he had always found water, though in others it failed; but this time he found his expectations fruſtrated; preſſed by drought, and animated by his companions, they, with ſome labour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved a flat ſtone, which lay at the bottom, with an intent to dig for water; but how were they ſurpriſed, when they ſaw a ſmall hole, and about ſix inches below its ſurface ſome very fine water; having ſatisfied the call of nature, their contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation led them to conſider whence this water ſprung; one of them imagined he ſaw it gently running, their ſtaves were put in to feel for bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, but none was found: inquſitive curioſity led them to ſound deeper, and lo! a ſapplin, of near thirty feet, found no bottom, and they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted with unſettled conjectures.</p>
               <p>On the 10th of June, 1771, i found myſelf in a diſagreeable ſituation, on the weſt courſe of Eaſt-Florida, through want of water; I ſaw fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently very ſtrong currents of diſcoloured water, indicating freſh ſtreams; ſuppoſing theſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from rivers, i coaſted along ſhore; but found nothing except innumerable iſlands and vaſt ſhoals; frequently taſting the water, found it always brackiſh: at length, on the 21ſt day of ſaid month, i found an opening, where I got an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chorage for my veſſel. I went perſonally on ſhore, to explore the ſmall iſland we were next to, taking with me a lad, and a thirty gallon caſk. Its aſpect was miſerable; oyſter ſhells and rocks were every where its ſuperficies; at laſt, however, I found a ſmall hole in the rock, and water in it; which, to my inexpreſſible joy proved
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:014440_0296_0F9261CFACE1AF60"/>
freſh, and of the cleareſt and fineſt kind; haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back on board, we were obliged to roll the caſk in the water, in order to get it into the boat, when, accidentally applying my hand to my mouth, i found to my ſurprize the water to be freſh; having proceeded on board, we taſted the water in which the veſſel ſwam, which alſo prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed freſh and good: thus i found, myſelf, as it were, in a ſea of freſh water; ſtimulated by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, i left the veſſel next day, with an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to penetrate to the main land, which, with difficulty was effected; but in a whole day's ſearch no river was found; yet a conſtant ſtrong current proceeded from the ſhore, and along it. The ſingularity of the circumſtance made me beat the ground, and ſtamp on it, which occaſioned a hollow ſound. I have ſince been informed by travellers, that between the town <hi>St. Mattheo,</hi> (now inhabited by ſavages, and ſituate on the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>St. Juan de Guacaro</hi>) and <hi>Apalachia,</hi> they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently meet with this hollow ſound under their horſes feet. Twenty miles eaſt from <hi>Apalachia,</hi> we croſs a place over a creek, called by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages, the natural bridge: all theſe circumſtances correſpond with an idea which I have formed of ſubterraneous rivers in this province. Another curioſity, though not a natural one, are the marks of former improvement of this country; particularly the veſtiges of the regular maize hills (even in woods where, ſince the aera of culture, trees of twelve to eighteen inches dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter have grown up) and the nails and ſpikes drove into ſome very large trees, apparently at ancient Spaniſh Cowpens; add to theſe, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of old fences, huts, houſes and churches,
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:014440_0297_0F9261D1A5389080"/>
particularly a church bell in the fields, at <hi>Santa Fé.</hi> Thus we have a melancholy inſtance, even in this new world, of the depredations of time, and a country once nobly and extenſively ſettled, through the inroads of the ſavages reduced again to a wilderneſs, yet all this muſt have happened ſome time later than Anno Domini 1543, the year when <hi>Soto</hi> compleated the firſt Chriſtian expedition to Florida, with his death.</p>
               <q>Tanta eſt terreſtrium viciſſitudo!</q>
               <p>The remaining natural curioſities are the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſprings, deſcribed in page 34 and 35, and the ridge of ſand hills between <hi>Oclawwawhaw,</hi> and <hi>St. John</hi>'s, likewiſe mentioned in page 35 and 36 of this volume. I alſo regard as a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity of the artificial kind, the immenſe orange groves, found in the woods between latitude 28½, and 30°, ſuppoſing them originally ſprung from the ſeeds of ſome oranges formerly dropt, by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling Spaniards, at their camps, but which are now gradually decaying, by reaſon of the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs of our traders and hunters, who, when in want of the fruit, cut down the tree; other ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable curioſities will more probably appear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the botanical heads. The many <hi>Tumuli,</hi> ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally intended for the peaceful repoſitory of the dead, tho' ſome of their tops now bear ſummer houſes for recreation to the living, are another cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity. Having mentioned hills, I could wiſh to know whence comes the idea of <hi>Apalachian Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> nothing above a moderate hill appearing in all this vaſt extent of country, till we meet (to the north of latitude 35) with the mountains of the <hi>Upper Cherokees,</hi> on the <hi>Tanaſſee</hi> river; and it is obſervable, that this ridge continuing back of
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:014440_0298_0F9261D1DB4199A0"/>
North-Carolina, Virginia and Maryland, through Pennſylvania, and back of New-Jerſey, into New-York, and terminating near Katſkill, about eight miles from Hudſon's River (where they bear the name of Blue Mountains) lie nearer to the ocean than to the Miſſiſſippi; all the country weſt of them is nearly a plain, there being no falls from <hi>Monongahela</hi> and <hi>Aligheny</hi> forks, down to the mouth of Miſſiſſippi, that are of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence enough to interrupt navigation; even the <hi>Ohio</hi> falls, ſo called, are not violently rapid; nor are there any falls from the place of embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kation on the <hi>Tanaſſee,</hi> down the <hi>Hogoheegee,</hi> to the <hi>Ohio;</hi> the <hi>Shawaneſe</hi> river, has none that ever I could learn; <hi>Tombechbe</hi> none in all its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;—whence then come the deſcriptions of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palachian Mountains?</hi> whence <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> at the foot of a hill, and many more ſuch dreams not worth repeating. Either the face of the country is more changed than any we read of elſewhere, or former writers having been abuſed, have again impoſed on us; for the face of Greece and other regions of the Eaſt, is yet reconcileable to <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>'s geography. <hi>Holland</hi> ſtill has nearly the ſame kind of ſuperficial appearance, as we are informed, it had eighteen hundred years ago; and we my ſtill trace <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> through theſe ancient habitations of the <hi>Catti, Kelti</hi> and <hi>Cheruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci;</hi> how then comes America ſo altered? Moſt of the deſcribers of this new world, even late ones muſt have impoſed upon us, either ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally, or by copying ſuch lying exaggerators and impoſtors, as the inventors of the conqueſt of <hi>Mexico,</hi> and others of his ſtamp; who, not content with giving us plain truth, and ſimple
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:014440_0299_0F9261D2955F5428"/>
facts in their native dreſs, have almoſt hid them from us by the thick clouds of fable.</p>
               <p>In this northern part of the province we find the following ſettlements of ſavages, about the middle of the land, nearly in latitude 28, in a village called New <hi>Yufala,</hi> being a colony from <hi>Yufala,</hi> in the upper Creek nation, planted in 1767, in a beautiful and fertile plain: about fifty miles N. E. from thence, and about thirty W. S. W. from the upper part of Lake George, in St. John's River, which is eighty miles nearly ſouth of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> is another town, ſituate on a very beautiful lake, about ſeven miles in length, and from one to one and an half in breadth; this town is acceſſible only on the N. W. ſide of the above lake, over a very narrow and high ridge: when i came to it from the ſouthward, though in a very dry ſeaſon, we had near a mile and a half, or two miles, to wade breaſt high, and ſometimes deeper, through a kind of marſh on the weſt bank. The town lies near the N. W. end of the lake, and from its ſituation is called <hi>Taloffa Ockhafé,</hi> i. e. the town of the lake; ſome iſlands in this lake, as well as ſome land near the town, are cultivated by the ſavages. Further north is <hi>Alacua, Santa Fé,</hi> and <hi>St. Mattheo,</hi> now inhabited by the ſavages; the fort at <hi>Apalache</hi> is now a trading houſe, chiefly in their poſſeſſion, and the weſtern extremity of the province is the great ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Apalachicola,</hi> on which the Lower Creek na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſettled, whoſe principal towns are called the <hi>Cowettas, Chatahoochas, Euchas, Citaſees, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goleegés, Oakmulgos, Tuſkeegies, Cuſſitos,</hi> and <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rokee Louſitſa,</hi> near the ruins of fort <hi>Apalachicola,</hi> at the junction of Flint River, and the river
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:014440_0300_0F9261D32FDF95B0"/>
in the ſouth weſtern extreme of this diviſion is the head of <hi>Manatee</hi> river, between which and the <hi>Amaxura,</hi> I ſaw a vaſt number of deer, and the marks of many of the hunting camps of the ſavages. We found the foot ſteps of ſix or eight buffaloes hereabouts, ſo plain as to be convinced of the track being made by thoſe animals, but ſaw none of the animals themſelves; the <hi>Amaxura</hi> or ſome of its branches is not far from the <hi>Mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee,</hi> and where we croſſed it, was an extenſive piece of excellent land.</p>
               <p>To compleat the <hi>Topography</hi> of this part, i ſhall maintain that <hi>Rio d'aïs</hi> abounds ſo much in fiſh of various kinds, that a perſon may ſit on the bank, and ſtick the fiſh with a knife, or ſharp ſtick, as they ſwim by; and i have frequently ſhot from four to twelve mullets at one ſhot, nay our boys uſed to go along ſide of the veſſel in the boat, and kill the cat-fiſh with a hatchet, or ſtick. This might well be ranked among the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities; but the whole country abounds ſo much in fiſh, that when <hi>St. Auguſtine</hi> flouriſhed moſt, the fiſhermen frequently uſed to allow people, who brought a <hi>Real,</hi> to take as much as they pleaſed, out of their boats.</p>
               <p>The reader will obſerve that the rules of geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy, with regard to natural limits, have cauſed me to vary a little in the preſent diviſion of the peninſula, from that adopted in page 1 and 2 in this work, which was founded in the climates; but the variation being ſmall, i hope it is excuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. I ſhall now proceed with the deſcription or topography of the ſouthern part of the peninſula.</p>
               <p>From the latitude 28, the lagoon of <hi>Aïſa,</hi> or Indian River, has not any thing very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:014440_0301_0F9261D3EFA41738"/>
until latitude 27: 20, where there is a mouth, or outwatering, into the ocean, with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſmall inlets within it. This mouth can ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom be entered by any veſſel that draws above five feet water; and before it, in the ſea, are two bars, the inner one having about ten, the outer one ſeventeen feet on it; and this outer one is near four miles from the land. The ſand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this entrance, is a fine white quickſand, of a particular nature. I have anchored ſeveral times within the diſtance of three or four leagues from this mouth, but not above once or twice without having the cable all eaten through, in the ring of the anchor; ſometimes i have purchaſed the anchor by a ſingle ſtrand, ſometimes by leſs, at other times by a little more; and i have loſt above ſix or ſeven anchors, and large grapnels at this place, yet there is nowhere any foul ground, or, in other words, no rocky bottom. At a mile, or more, from the ſhore, and within that diſtance, i think, i have found a few ſhell ſtones, I imagine that this fine quickſand, being very ſharp, by its continual motion chafes and frets the cable quite through, and this, it generally does, in leſs than four and twenty hours.</p>
               <p>From this mouth of the lagoon an iſland ſtretches to about the latitude 26, 55, where there is another mouth, or inlet, caled <hi>Hobé</hi> by the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards; this iſland is thirty-nine meaſured ſtatute miles long: at twenty-four miles from its north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end are ſeveral high cliffs of a blue ſtone; theſe are the firſt rocks that lie high out of the water, along the American beach; they are placed at about high water mark, and a ſmall ridge, or reef, runs ſloping off from the northernmoſt one:
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:014440_0302_0F9261D4AE26D1C0"/>
and about nine miles further, towards <hi>Hobé</hi> is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other parcel; as there is likewiſe at the entrance of <hi>Hobé,</hi> of very ſolid, hard rock; all which, particularly the northernmoſt ones, are excellent landmarks for the ſeamen, going ſouthwards. The remarkable things about this iſland are, that it is a narrow ſlip of beach, and mangrove land; on the beach are always great numbers of pieces of Spaniſh cedar; originally cut on the windward rivers of Cuba, for the uſe of the <hi>Catholic</hi> King's ſhip-yards; but by land floods drove into the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hama channel, and Gulph ſtream, whence the frequent eaſt-winds force them upon foundings, and ſo on this beach; very few pieces are found either north or ſouth of this iſland. The iſland on its weſt-ſide is indented, almoſt regularly into points and bays. Freſh water may be obtained by digging in almoſt every part of the beach. The chief growth here are <hi>mangroves, blackwood, c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A few ſpots of <hi>hammock,</hi> or upland, are found on this iſland; theſe produce the <hi>zanto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xylum, ficus citri folio, Coccoloba, Maſtick, Boraſſus,</hi> and a few trees of the live oak, and w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Tillandſia Lingulata.</note>, which, by its ſtructure naturally contains a conſiderable quantity of rain-water, preſerved in a freſh, ſweet taſte. So induſtrious are the bears at digging up the eggs, that the turtle ſeldom leaves her neſt above a quarter of an hour before they are eaten, inſomuch, that a traveller, if he choſes any of this proviſion, is obliged to watch the turtles coming. I have ſeen the bears approach within five or ſix yards of our camp, at times when we had ſome of theſe eggs, but this ſtretch of <hi>latronical</hi> boldneſs, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally coſt them their lives.</p>
               <p>Oppoſite this iſland the ſhore is ſandy and high, here are many rivulets, and the <hi>Beraſſus</hi> here ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be the maſter of the ſoil, ſcarce any other plant ſhewing itſelf; directly oppoſite the rocks before deſcribed is the mouth of <hi>St. Lucia</hi> river, which has a wide kind of bay, for eight miles up, ſtretching firſt N. E. 40 W. four miles, then W. four miles more, when it divides into two branches, one coming from the ſouth, the other from the N. W. by N. this laſt appearing the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, i went up it for twenty-four miles, reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing direct diſtance, and found no where leſs than ſeven feet water; here the river became narrow, and partly on account of the obſtructions by logs, partly on account of the rapidity of the ſtream, I left the veſſel; and going up by land, found the river at laſt to run through a vaſt plain, the bank of the ſtream only being fringed with a few trees.</p>
               <p>Here we ſhot what number of deer, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kies we pleaſed, and might have continued ſo to do, i dare ſay, two months longer; the reaſon
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:014440_0304_0F9261D8C5934EA0"/>
of this plenty is, in my opinion, that this tract is ſcarcely ever invaded by the hoſtile ſavages, or yet more deſtructive white hunter; this is the river, which, as i was told by a Spaniſh pilot and fiſherman of good credit, proceeds from the lake <hi>Mayacco,</hi> a lake of ſeventy-five miles in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference by his account. The man told me that he had formerly been taken by the ſavages, and by them carried a priſoner, in a canoe, by way of this river, to their ſettlements on the banks of the lake; he ſays, that at the diſemboguing of the river, out of the lake, lies a ſmall cedar iſland; he alſo told me that he ſaw the mouth of five or ſix rivers, but whether falling out of, or into the lake, i could not learn of him; probably ſome of the many rivers i croſſed in my journey acroſs this peninſula, fall into it, and it is not improbable that St. John's river originates in it. The large river in Charlotte harbour, by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of its courſe, meridian ſituation, and great width, i judge, might, perhaps, ſpring from the ſame fountain; however, the ſavages of <hi>Taloffo Ochaſé</hi> told me, that in going far ſouth, they go round a large water, emptying itſelf into the weſt ſea, i. e. gulph of <hi>Mexico.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much have i been able to learn of this water, the exploring of which i always intended; whether there is really this lake, or not, i will not be poſitive, but the above circumſtances, joined to a dark account, which the ſavages give of going up St. John's, and coming down an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other river, to go into ſome far ſouthern region of Eaſt Florida (on which account the name of <hi>Ylacco,</hi> and the name given to <hi>St. Lucia</hi> by the ſavages, both conveying indecent meanings, are
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:014440_0305_0F9261DAB3755ED0"/>
by them given to theſe rivers) ſeems to confirm it. That there is ſome ſuch great water, is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be gathered from the profuſion of freſh water which this river, <hi>St. Lucia,</hi> pours down. Such is the immenſe quantity that the whole ſound between the abovenamed iſland and the main, though an arm of the ſea, ſituate in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſalt region, and in general two miles wide, is very often rendered totally freſh thereby: in ſo much, that it has made the very ſpeculative Mr. <hi>De Brahm</hi> inſiſt upon having ſeen mangrove ſtumps in freſh water. This lake has given riſe to the interſected, and mangled condition in which we ſee the peninſula exhibited in old maps. But to return to the mouth of the river <hi>St. Lucia,</hi> it lays one mile, ſeventy four chains, and ſeventy links, S. W. by S. from the great rocks; the mouth is fifty-four chains, eighty-nine links wide: ſix miles and a quarter N. N. W. from the mouth on the edge of the ſound, lieth the hill by the Spaniards called <hi>Ropa Tendida,</hi> and by us the <hi>Bleach-Yard,</hi> on account of its appearance; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a high hill full of white ſpots, the firſt of any note from the <hi>Neverſinks</hi> in the Jerſeys, to this place, and is a remarkable land-mark. At the mouth of the river is a bay, into which runs a rivulet from the ſouth; Mr. <hi>De Brahm</hi> has ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured this with the name of <hi>Grenville River,</hi> on account of a tract of land here laid out for that gentleman, on one of the moſt unaccountable pieces of white ſand i ever ſaw; which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its being covered with a large growth of all ſorts of trees, indicating a fine ſoil, i have always looked upon in the light of a natural cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity.</p>

In ſhort, this part of the country is ſuch a curioſity, that i have many times lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the want of leiſure, and means to explore it thoroughly. My journal from the bay of <hi>Tampe,</hi> over land to <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> threw indeed a great light on this; but to my irretrievable loſs i have miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it theſe four or five years: I can, however remark upon the authority of that journal, that he fertile land is found in leſs proportion, in the interior part of the peninſula, in this ſouthern, than in the northern diviſion;—that the ground becomes more ſtony as we approach the meridio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal regions; that it is likewiſe interſperſed with the ſame kind of romantic ponds, or lakes, as deſcribed on page,—that in the river <hi>Manatee</hi> is a conſiderable fall of rocks fourteen miles from its mouth;—that above theſe falls the banks are very ſteep;—that this ſteepneſs cauſes the water
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:014440_0307_0F9261DC3B31EE40"/>
to riſe about fifty feet above its ordinary ſurface; a circumſtance which this ſhort river has in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with all torrents;—and that the bay of <hi>Tampe,</hi> into which this river falls, is the moſt proper place in all America, ſouth of Halifax, for the rendezvous of a large fleet of heavy ſhips; the country all around being plentifully timbered and watered; the ſoil is poor, ſome of the iſlands along the weſt coaſt excepted, and both this and Charlotte harbour are excellent ſituations for eſtabliſhing fiſheries.</p>
               <p>From Hobé to the latitude 25:44, the coaſt is all double land, or narrow necks between the ſea; there are ſome rivers and lagoons; on the banks of ſuch of them as are freſh we meet with great bodies of marſh land, which may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable. About fifty miles north, of the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern point of the main land the coaſt changes its courſe from S. S. E. to directly ſouth; and at the head land, occaſioned by this, is a large hard blue rock on the beach, out of which a large ſtream of very fine freſh water iſſues, guſhing directly into the ocean; there are four little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets between this rock and latitude 25:35; one of theſe not always open; the laſt is in the north end of the firſt iſland, whoſe ſouth end <hi>De Brahm</hi> has thought proper to call Cape Florida, although it is by no means a cape, or head land at all. Weſt from this is the river <hi>Rattones,</hi> being a fine ſtream, and pretty conſiderable, with a little good rich ſoil on its banks, where many tropical plants grow; at its mouth are the remains of a ſavage ſettlement. To the ſouthward of this ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is a large body of marſh, through which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral rivulets of fine water empty themſelves into
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:014440_0308_0F9261DCEE48C528"/>
the ſound, back of the keys, which begin here, that a man may here ſtand with one foot in freſh, and the other in ſalt water; nay when the tide is out freſh water boils up through the ſand. From this river and marſh the remainder of the land is a heap of ſtones and rocks, very ſharp, and little water to be found, there being only a few ponds, and theſe dry in a dry ſeaſon. The only growth here is ſhrubby pine. At Sandy point, the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern extremity of the peninſula, are large old fields, being the lands formerly planted by the <hi>Colooſa</hi> ſavages; in latitude 25:20, is a ſalt lake, and a remarkable <hi>iſthmus,</hi> joining what was formerly called <hi>Cayo largo,</hi> or long key to the main: our reſearches for a paſſage, weſt of the keys, have convinced us of its being faſt to the main land. In the bay of Juan Ponce De Leon, in the weſt ſide of the land, we meet with innumerable ſmall iſlands, and ſeveral freſh ſtreams: the land in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral is drowned mangrove ſwamp. On the banks of theſe ſtreams we meet with ſome hills of rich ſoil, and on every one of thoſe the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent marks of their having been formerly culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by the ſavages. I went up into ſome high trees on theſe hills, to ſee if i could not ſpy the pine land from their tops, with a view, if i ſaw it any where near, to penetrate to it, through the ſwamps, but the neareſt i ſaw was, by computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, twelve miles off.</p>
               <p>Theſe hills, among this dreary mangrove land, have apparently been the laſt retreats, and ſkulk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing places, of the <hi>Colooſa</hi> ſavages, when their more potent neighbours, the <hi>Creeks,</hi> drove them off the continent. <hi>Punta largo,</hi> or cape <hi>Roman,</hi> in lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude 25:43, on the weſt-ſide, terminates with

Of what conſequence this is, in a place through which the Spaniards are obliged to ſend all their treaſures, every one may judge. At <hi>Cayo Tabona,</hi> a large ſhip, even of 60 guns, may ride juſt within the reef, and her ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der can always ſupply her with water, either from <hi>Matacombé,</hi> or the above-named marſh, and key <hi>Biſkay.</hi> Few veſſels can come through the gulph without coming in ſight of this place, and it is generally the firſt land made by every ſail of ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping after they leave the <hi>Cuba</hi> ſhore, Sound-Point, or Cape-Florida, being juſt N. of it. <hi>Matacombé</hi> is another good ſtation for ſmall veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, which may run in here, and the <hi>Bahama</hi> bank affords anchorage in caſe one would chuſe to cruize acroſs. <hi>Cayo Huiſo,</hi> commonly called Key Weſt, is another good ſtation for a ſmall frigate, but not ſo advantageous as the others, nor is there ſo much ſafety here.</p>
               <p>Nothing further of note occurs at theſe iſlands, except that at <hi>Cayos Vacos,</hi> and <hi>Cayo Huiſo,</hi> we ſee the remains of ſome ſavage habitations, built, or rather piled up of ſtones; theſe were the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuges of the <hi>Calooſa</hi> nation; but even here the water did not protect them againſt the inroads from the Creeks, and in 1763 the remnant of this people, conſiſting of about eighty families, left this laſt poſſeſſion of their native land, and went to the Havannah. They were a tribe of excellent fiſhermen; this nation was ſtrenuouſly

engaged in the Spaniſh intereſt, they were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned in a manner ſomewhat monarchical, and while they lived on theſe keys, were the dread and terror of the ſeamen; who, not being able to ſteer clear of the dangerous reefs which are here, eſcaped one kind of cruel death, to run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the jaws of one ſtill more terrible: the inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity committed by the <hi>Colooſas,</hi> on ſhipwrecked mariners, is ſhocking even to Barbarians. A little key lying before <hi>Matacombé</hi> is a dreadful monument of this, it is called the <hi>Matança,</hi> (i. e.) ſlaughter, from the murder of near four hundred wretched Frenchmen, who, being caſt away, fell into the hands of theſe monſters; who, after keeping them in the adjacent iſlands for ſome time, carried them all to this little key, which now ſerves them for one common grave. The people from Providence, who came here for turtle or Mahogany wood, came always armed, and had frequent bruſhes with them, ſo that the diſlodging of theſe fierce ſavages has been of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to navigation. The unhappy ſufferer by wreck, who eſcapes with life, may now be ſure of ſafety on the ſhore of theſe iſlands. Having mentioned the cutting of mahogany it may be proper to obſerve that little or none now remains here.</p>

               <p>The river <hi>Apalachicola</hi> is the boundary of the two provinces; before its mouth eaſtward, and a little weſtward, we meet with St. George's Iſlands, well known for the ſufferings of <hi>Pierre Viaud,</hi> &amp;c. after ſhipwreck here. I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that the relation we have of this affair is a great exaggeration of facts; people in that ſituation may ſuffer, but on a place like this, where plenty of fiſh, crabs and oyſters are to be had, as well as water, for the trouble of digging, their ſufferings cannot be great. Our pity is much leſſened upon finding a reaſonable man ſo

debilitated by fright and deſpair, that he cannot make uſe of a plenty provided by providence. All along this coaſt fiſh are in ſuch abundance, that both myſelf and people, when not inclined to fiſh with a hook and line, have ſtruck many hundreds with a ſtick ſharpened at one end, and hardened in the fire, in lieu of a harpoon; i will not mention much about the exaggeration of diſtreſs, which runs through the whole of this performance; but the ſtory of Madame <hi>La Couture</hi> bringing a turkey and her eggs, out of the woods, at the time when relief had reached her fellow ſuffere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As this fiſh bears a diſtant reſemblance to a turtle, perhaps Mr. <hi>Viaud</hi> took it for ſuch, and wrote <hi>tortue,</hi> which may have been tranſlated turtle too, but by a miſtake common enough in printing-offices, the compoſitor may have made it a turkey <note n="*" place="bottom">I find mention made alſo of a <hi>buſtard,</hi> it is well known that there is not one of this kind of birds in all America; however a <hi>buſtard</hi> is in French called <hi>outarde,</hi> and this is the name given by the French to the blackhead Canada gooſe, which abounds here in the ſeaſon, when <hi>Viaud</hi> was on this coaſt, this the tranſlator ſeems not to have been informed of.

               <p>But to proceed, a little weſt of theſe iſlands we find Cape Blaze in latitude 29:47, and the Bay of St. Joſeph, to the N.

All theſe places are very arid, dry ſand, near the coaſt; farther in towards the Upper Creek coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which is in ſome meaſure deſcribed in page 91, it is ſcarcely known, but what i have ſeen of
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:014440_0322_0F9261F3CAA7B4F8"/>
it is much like Georgia, and the north part of Eaſt Florida.</p>
               <p>Penſacola has about an hundred and eighty houſes in it, built in general in a good taſte, but of timber: the town is laid out in an oblong ſquare, near the foot of an hill, called <hi>Gage-hill;</hi> and by means of two rivulets of excellent water, which almoſt ſurround it, is the beſt watered of any i know on the continent. The harbour is ſpacious, and here are three conſiderable rivers, viz. <hi>Eſcambé, Cheſter,</hi> and <hi>Middle</hi> rivers, beſides ſeveral lagoons and rivulets of no note. <hi>Cheſter-river</hi> is full of iſlands, great and ſmall, abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing principally with the <hi>Cupreſſus Thyoides. Middle-river</hi> communicates with ſeveral lakes; the water of this river is ſo cold, that the ſavages call it <hi>Weewa Caſupka,</hi> which in the Creek language ſignifies cold water. The <hi>Eſcambé</hi> is navigable a conſiderable way up, but rapid, and about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty miles from Penſacola we begin to meet with ſome ſpots of fertile land, variouſly timbered. Twenty-eight miles from the town, and on the banks of this river, on an eminence, are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of a Spaniſh out-guard, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Fourteen miles farther weſt from Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacola, is the <hi>Rio Perdido,</hi> or loſt river, of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable

length and navigation; and about for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty miles weſt of this, we meet with <hi>Mobile, Tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bechbé</hi> and <hi>Taënſa</hi> bay and rivers; into which laſt the <hi>Alibama,</hi> or <hi>Cooſa</hi> river falls. All the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try between this laſt river and <hi>Cheſter-river,</hi> and probably all to <hi>Apalachicola</hi> is very favourable for ſtocks of cattle; many noble cane branches, mixed in the pine land, affording them excellent food, and they multiply very rapidly. Lovers of minute geography, by examining my maps, will find that the lower part of the coaſt between <hi>Mobile</hi> bay and <hi>Perdido,</hi> and ſo on to <hi>Penſacola,</hi> may eaſily be made navigable for boats in land, there being already a rolling road out of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Ben ſecour,</hi> into a creek running into <hi>Perdido;</hi> but this being mere matter of ſpeculation we muſt leave the practical part to ſome future ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. The country weſt from <hi>Mobile</hi> bay, to <hi>Nita Albany,</hi> or Bean-camp, at lake <hi>Maurepas,</hi> is much of the ſame kind as that already deſcribed; only we find more fertile planting ground in it. The timber here is nearly the ſame as in the north part of Eaſt-Florida; but it is worthy of remark, that not one of the <hi>Boraſſus,</hi> or Cabbage tree, is found along this whole extent from <hi>Apalachia</hi> weſtward; which does not agree well with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port in a letter to a certain <hi>George Lookup,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> in <hi>Robinſon</hi>'s hiſtory of <hi>Florida,</hi> where he ſays, that the cabbage trees along this coaſt, rear their lofty heads above all others; but ſo curious a piece as this pamphlet is ought not to be ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaked, i will therefore proceed to give ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts from my journals through the weſtern parts of Weſt Florida, as being the beſt way to give my reader a true idea of this country.</p>

of the nation, we returned to <hi>Hewitt</hi>'s houſe at <hi>Abeeka,</hi> our road from <hi>Chicaſawhay,</hi> leading chiefly through fine improved, and many among them rich fields, and a large number of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable towns and villages of the ſavages.</p>
               <p>10th November, having diſmiſſed <hi>Pooſcoos-Mingo,</hi> we went to the Chicaſaw nation, through a road leading in general over ſtiff clay land; ſaw very little elſe but white oak, and that no where tall, occaſioned by the ſtiffneſs of the land; croſſed only two rivers of note, one <hi>Naſhooba,</hi> the other <hi>Oka tebbee haw;</hi> no remarkable aſcent or deſcent on the whole road; croſſed many ſavan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nahs, the diſtance is about an hundred and fifty-nine miles from <hi>Abeeka,</hi> to the <hi>Chicaſaw</hi> towns; (deſcribed in page 63) where we arrived on the 18th November, and put up at the houſe of one <hi>Buckles,</hi> a trader: our courſe hitherto has chiefly been north. Here i ſtayed till the 8th Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and obſerved this houſe to lie in nearly 35° north latitude.</p>
               <p>I cannot help relating in this place an anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote of Mr. Commiſſary in this nation; this Gentleman had engaged to me, and promiſed Mr. <hi>Stuart,</hi> that i ſhould have all the neceſſary aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance i might want; i went to his plantation, which lays at <hi>Paön titack,</hi> eleven miles from the place where he ought to reſide, and to my aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment i was here treated worſe than in any place i had been at: ſo far from providing horſes, which was one of the articles i wanted, i was obliged to give him one back, which i had bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed at the Chactaw, in lieu of one that failed me. I ſaw clearly, that i was an unwelcome gueſt in every reſpect; however, i procured
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:014440_0333_0F926206625ED7E8"/>
from him a recommendatory note, to the above <hi>Buckles,</hi> and he told me that <hi>Buckles</hi> knew of two canoes, the choice of which i might have for my intended voyage, down the river; but when i ſpoke to Mr. <hi>Buckles</hi> on the ſubject, he denied ever having ſpoke about any canoes, nor did he know of any, and as to the note, i might have any thing i wanted on my own credit, by giving an order on Mr. <hi>Stuart;</hi> but with the commiſſary he had nothing to do. Thus i was obliged to do all myſelf at laſt; this is in ſome meaſure an inſtance of the inutility of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary's office; i ſent Mr. <hi>Dow</hi> with three ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes to the river, to make a canoe. During my ſtay here, on the firſt December, it began to freeze very hard; on the fourth the ice in town-creek was four or five inches thick; and on the 6th in the morning we could ſcarce keep water from freezing in a cloſe houſe, and near a good fire; but i ſaw no ſnow during all the time of my ſtay. Nothing was more entertaining than the ſurprize of the ſavages, at ſeeing me take ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of the ſolar altitude, the mercury i uſed for an artificial horizon, was a matter of great wonder to them, particularly, when i ſhewed them its diviſibility, and the ſucceeding cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the globules.</p>
               <p>8th December, in the afternoon i proceeded from Buckles's houſe, and travelled E. by S. nearly five miles and a half; then croſſed <hi>Nohoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la-inalchubba,</hi> or the town Creek, mentioned in page 63, then went about S.

ſavages, of the Creek nation, and three more of the Natchez, who live with the Upper Creeks, coming through the <hi>Chicaſaw</hi> field, with the <hi>Death Whoop:</hi> they had ſurprized a hunting camp of <hi>Chactaws,</hi> on a branch of the river <hi>Yaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoo,</hi> called <hi>Tallé Hatcha,</hi> at a time when the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were abſent, and took away all their ſkins, two horſes, and five women of the <hi>Chacchooma</hi> tribe, belonging to weſt <hi>Congeta,</hi> in the <hi>Chactaw</hi> nation: they took care not to ſtay for the return of the men, as the camp indicated them to be numerous; but becauſe they had not a ſcalp to ſhew, theſe devils incarnate had ſcalped the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the women they carried into captivity, yet let the wretch live, and ſhe was one of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber we ſaw. The <hi>Chicaſaws</hi> were all abroad that day; but i obſerved by the behaviour of ſome ſuperannuated fellows, that they diſliked the <hi>Creeks</hi> behaviour of bawling the <hi>Death Whoop</hi> through the field; and having aſked the reaſon, i was told, that as they were neutrals in this war, they did not like to give umbrage, which the <hi>Chactaws</hi> might take at this, and if their men had been at home, they would not have ſuffered this ſmall victorious party to make uſe of this kind of triumphal entry here; thus we ſee theſe ſavages ſtrictly obſerving a neutrality in form.</p>
               <p n="9">9th. Proceeded, and at 3 miles, ſaw a large <hi>tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus,</hi> which was the only remarkable thing in this road, we went over one ſteep hill, and croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed three or four branches, and the laſt two miles and a half of the road we ſaw much pine mixed with the oak; having travelled nearly twenty three miles on a courſe S.

               <p n="10">10th. Examined the canoe, but found her too heavy for our purpoſe, therefore diſpatched Mr. <hi>Dow</hi> (who knew the ground, and was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the woods) to ſee if he could not find ſome canoe of the ſavages; he found one about noon, in the mouth of <hi>Nahoola inalchubba,</hi> two miles and a half weſt from our camp, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore went and encamped on the bank of ſaid creek; the oppoſite bank was very high ſteep hills, above hundred and twenty feet perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and ſome pines on their ſummits; found the canoe a very ſorry one, but it being <hi>Hopſon</hi>'s choice, muſt venture in her.</p>
               <p n="11">11th. We ſpent in fitting our craft; ſince the 7th we had very bad weather here, one hour it is ſharp, clear, and intenſely cold, the next cloudy, ſultry, with lightning, thunder, rain and hail, the wind veering round the horizon in an incredible manner, which made my ſituation very diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p n="12">12th. We had ſome tolerable weather, and finiſhed fitting our boat, but ſhe was ſo miſerable a tool, that i believe few men would have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured in her.</p>
               <p n="13">13th. All the company returned to the nation with the horſes; kept only Mr. <hi>Dow,</hi> and my ſervant, to be the companions of this fluvial ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition; while we ſtaid here we caught ſome beavers. At half an hour paſt one, P. M. we proceeded from our camp in <hi>Nahoola Inalchubba,</hi> or Town Creek, and in twenty minutes were in the river. We paſſed one bluff, where the French formerly had a fortified trading houſe, about one mile below the mouth of the creek, on
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:014440_0336_0F9262086E4398F0"/>
the weſt bank; we paſſed one creek on each ſide, and left three ſmall gravelly iſlands on our left; for the reſt of the land was low on both ſides;— having come five miles and an half we came to camp on a ſand bar at half an hour paſt three, P. M. the river pretty rapid, and found only one log, which detained us a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p n="14">14th. Proceeded at ten o'clock, A. M. in half an hour paſt a bluff on the eaſt ſide, and in half an hour more found a very tall cypreſs laying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs the river, by which we were detained an hour; but cutting the top away we paſſed on; about three quarters of an hour after had ſome pine land <note n="*" place="bottom">When the pine is mentioned hereabouts, I mean the <hi>Pinus Abies Virginiana, conis parvis ſubrotundis,</hi> or the balm of <hi>Gilead</hi> pine.</note> on the weſt bank; in general the land on both ſides is low. About two o'clock P. M. paſt a ſmall iſland; about half an hour after two the bank on the weſt ſide was about ſeventy feet high; <note n="‖" place="bottom">N. B. The river was high.</note> continued between pretty high banks till half an hour after three, when we encamped on a high ſand bar, on the weſt ſide of the river, current unequal, and the obſtructions of no note, ſince we cut the tree; travelled this day nine miles.</p>
               <p n="15">15th. Departed half an hour paſt ten o'clock A. M. paſt ſeveral iſlands, and found the bank, on the weſt ſide, in many places high, we ſaw in many others high and intervale oak land;—not ſo much drowned land as the former days;— paſſed through ſeveral rapids, and at half an hour paſt three, P. M. came to camp at the end of a

large high pine bluff, on the eaſt ſide, having travelled this day fifteen miles.</p>
               <p n="16">16th. At half an hour paſt nine o'clock, A. M. proceeded and came paſt a variety of high and low land; ſhot ſome ducks and teals; but unfortunately this forenoon loſt our gun, being torn out of my hands by a ſnag of a tree, and as it ſunk in deep water, it was irrecoverable, the river being rapid. About two o'clock P. M. paſt a ſhort hill, on the weſt ſhore, upwards of eighty feet high above the preſent level of the water;—paſſed a few creeks and lagoons, three iſlands and ſeveral rapids; we came down four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen miles and three quarters, and at half an hour paſt three, encamped on the eaſt ſide in an hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
               <p n="17">17th. Proceeded a quarter before nine A. M. and in leſs than half an hour ſaw a hill, a little inland, on the weſt ſide; and an hour after this we had the mouth of a river on the eaſt, this is called, at its fording place, in the trading path, the laſt branch of <hi>Tombechbé;</hi> none of the banks we paſt this morning were very low, and on the weſt ſide, oppoſite this mouth of a river, the banks fifty or ſixty feet higher than the preſent ſurface of the water. The weather being ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cold i was obliged to go on ſhore and make a fire, on this highland, half a mile below the above river, near the mouth of a ſtony creek, which we took to be the <hi>Sonac Tocalè,</hi> which we had croſſed in the road going up; here we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained till noon. We paſſed three iſlands this day, and the general run of the land is midd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling high on both ſides. The weather was very ſevere, which obliged us to encamp at one o'clock,
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:014440_0338_0F926209F352EE68"/>
in the mouth of a creek, called Old Town Creek, at the foot of an hill, riſing about ſeventy feet out of the water, having come about ſeven miles: it rained very hard all the afternoon, and the next two days, by which means we kept in camp till the</p>
               <p n="20">20th, at noon. Half a mile from our camp the high land ends, and we travelled but one hour and twenty minutes, when the ſeverity of the weather obliged us again to encamp, having come ſix miles, and in that diſtance found chiefly low land: paſt four iſlands, and as many rapids, one of them a bad paſs: our camp was on a piece of fine rich, middling high land, which Mr. <hi>Dew</hi> reported to be very extenſive. We lay here on account of bad weather; ſuch as cold, rain and ſnow, till the</p>
               <p n="26">26th, when at a little paſt twelve we departed. During our ſtay here the water gained near four feet in height: in one hour and an half, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gone near five miles, and paſt ſix or ſeven iſlands and rapids, we were at the mouth of the river <hi>Oca Tibehaw,</hi> the lower road between the <hi>Choct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ws</hi> and <hi>Chicaſaws;</hi>—croſſed this river about two miles above this place;—about one mile below this, having paſt an iſland, we ſaw a very remarkable bluff on the weſt ſide, riſing above fifty feet out of the preſent level of the water; this is near a mile and a half long; the bluff is covered principally with <hi>Juniper,</hi> or ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar ſhrubs, and in it are two or three gullies, in which as many ſprings come trickling down for about two thirds of its length: a bank projects out at its foot, having a flat and very even ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, without any plants, (a little graſs excepted)
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:014440_0339_0F92620AF6FBD9F8"/>
growing thereon. This ſurface projects about nine or ten feet from the bluff into the river, and was about eight feet above the level of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it looks as if made by art, and if placed near any town of note, i do not doubt would be much uſed as a walk. The bluff ends in two little hills, and a ſmall iſland is at the lower end of it; all which, added to its being in the form of a creſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, makes it have a very romantic appearance. From hence we went paſt one more bluff, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable iſland, and a rapid; in which laſt we had low pine land on the eaſt bank, and got into the mouth of a creek, called eleven mile creek, which we went up half a mile, and at three P. M. we were forced by the rain to come to camp, having travelled this day, ten miles and a half.</p>
               <p n="27">27th. The rain obliged us to lay by all day.</p>
               <p n="28">28th. At 11 o'clock we embarked, and had more rapids to go thro' than on any of the former days; likewiſe ſaw more high land than before. I think it remarkable, that we ſee ſo very few outwaterings of creeks, or rivers, into the great river. An hour and an half after leaving camp we ſaw a bark log, juſt landed on the weſt ſide, and evident marks of people having juſt landed; this was in a long reach, and we had ſeen a ſmoak, but when we came near the bark log, the ſmoak vaniſhed all at once. We ſoon found theſe people to be a war party of Creeks, who perceiving our boat, had put out their fire, which on theſe occaſions they make of hickory bark and other oily matters, that yield little ſmoak. We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore put on our hats, which we had not on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it being a fine agreeable day, and rather warm, and laying on the paddles, did all we

could to ſhew that we were white people. It was fortunate for me that i had not brought a ſavage guide with me, which would have expoſed us to a volley from thoſe warriors; we did not ſee them, but we knew by the ſuppreſſion of the ſmoak, that they had diſcovered us; they were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>gs, made of cones, both above and below this place, upon which the war party ferry over. Half a mile lower down we ſaw the mouth of a middling large creek, on the eaſt ſide. We paſt four iſlands this day, in two hours and an half's time. We ſaw one of the high ſavannahs, which bounds here on the river, with a delightful graſſy bluff: the river is here above two hundred feet wide. Having come twenty three miles, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped at four o'clock, on a gravel bar. We ſaw many places that appeared like old fields, as having been formerly cultivated.</p>
               <p n="29">29th. At nine o'clock proceeded; the firſt half hour we paſſed chiefly through drowned lands, and then came to a large lagoon, going to N. W. in which were innumerable geeſe and ducks; but the weſt bank of the lagoon is a handſome bluff. In half an hour more we came to a creek's mouth on the weſt: we ſaw again ſome ſpots bearing marks of former cultivation, and more of drowned land; the river in general this day rapid, with many iſlands: at half an hour paſt three, P. M. having travelled thirty-five miles, we encamped on the eaſt ſide, in a lagoon, on a high bank, where, for the firſt time, we ſaw the rich ground clear of large canes;
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:014440_0341_0F92620C32D1FAB0"/>
this being timbered, chiefly with the ſhag b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="30">30th. This morning we had our boat loaden, but it began to rain, and thus were obliged to unload again. Here we found a canoe which was well made, but had been by the ſavages, on account of the war, ſcuttled, and rendered unfit for uſe, however we found, that if we could make her any ways tight, ſhe would be more ſafe than the one we had, and this we effected by the help of wedges, clay and leather. Our proviſions beginning to grow ſcant, and having loſt the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gun i had taken with me, i began to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy, eſpecially as we found the beavers become leſs plenty. This weather was uncommonly bad till the evening of the third of January, 1772, when it cleared up, and next morning</p>
               <p>4th January, 1772, at a quarter before 11 o' clock, A. M. we proceeded in our new craft<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by half an hour paſt one, P. M. we had pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> high banks, and two iſlands: at this hour we had one of the ſavannahs on the weſt ſide, the bank being here about four feet out of the water: at a quarter before four we were at a conſiderable iſland, having gone ſince the laſt ſavannah bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ween low banks; a quarter before five o'clock came to camp under a low bluff, on the eaſt ſide. The canoe proves very leaky, and on unloading we find a great deal of our bread ſpoiled. This day came twenty-two miles and an half, the canes and timber are here exceeding large.</p>
               <p n="5">5th. At a quarter paſt ten embarked: high banks on both ſides. At half an hour after eleven, paſt the mouth of a river from the eaſt; this is called by the ſavages <hi>Naſhebaw.</hi> The

and here is exceeding rich, the canes very large, and we ſaw a ſpecies of <hi>phaſeolus,</hi> in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, along the banks. About a mile and a quarter below the creek, we met four ſavages from <hi>Abeka,</hi> in the <hi>Chactaw</hi> nation, to whom Mr. <hi>Dow</hi> was known. The river has riſen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably ſince yeſterday; the current has been for theſe two days almoſt uniformly at the rate of three miles per hour. It is remarkable, that though the velocity of our way was not much above two miles per hour, independent of the current, yet we had ſeveral inſtances of having evidently out-run the flood at night, in ſo much that it would ſcarce reach us again before morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. We came to camp near the ſavages above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, having come ſeven miles and an half; they had a good canoe which i intended to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe. The weather was very cold to day. Loſt a ſilver ſpoon at our laſt camp, which Mr. <hi>Dow</hi> propoſed to go and fetch; but he found it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable to croſs the <hi>Naſhehaw</hi> river. I agreed with the ſavages that they ſhould hunt for us to procure proviſions. At night it rained; our camp was on the eaſt ſide, in a very rich ſpot. We have not yet ſeen any ſand or gravel, except on the bars and iſlands in the river, the ſoil in general being clay, or loam, with a dry black mould.</p>
               <p n="6">6th. After a great deal of perſuaſion, i bought the canoe from the ſavages; and they brought me in two deer, and a turkey; for all which i gave them five yards of blue ſtrouds, two pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der horns, a knife, and ſome ſmall ſhot. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed our laſt camp to them, and deſired them to look for the abovementioned ſpoon, directing
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:014440_0343_0F92620DAF8EF8F8"/>
them to leave it in their own country, with Mr. <hi>Dow</hi>'s partner, who lived juſt by their homes, and gave them a note to him, deſiring him to pay them for their trouble; but when they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it to be the <hi>white ſtone</hi> (i. e.) ſilver, they declined going purpoſely for it; but promiſed, if chance led them to the place to carry it as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, for they, not being able to work it, in caſe the trader refuſed to pay them, they would loſe their labour; but had it been <hi>the fat of the earth</hi> (i. e.) lead or pewter, in that caſe they might make bullets, or ear-rings of it, and then they would not take pains in vain: towards even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they left us, and during night we barbecued our veniſon, to preſerve it.</p>
               <p n="7">7th. At half an hour paſt ſeven o'clock A. M. embarked in our new craft; all day we paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween high banks, ſome ſteep, ſome ſloping; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral as high as eighty feet above the ſurface of the water; one of theſe has an extenſive ſavan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah on the top. At the end of nineteen miles and an half, on the weſt ſide, we ſaw the mouth of the river <hi>Noxſhubby,</hi> or <hi>Hatcha ooſe,</hi> its banks are high on both ſides: here ſeems to be the true theatre of the war, for the bark logs are very numerous. The river is widened now from two hundred to two hundred and fifty feet. A mile and a half below the mouth of <hi>Noxſhubby</hi> is the firſt bluff of arid ochre, like earth, very high and ſteep; and about eight miles lower a white one, being a kind of ſtone almoſt as ſoft as chalk. Towards evening we met with ſeveral ſand bars, and little iſles. At four o'clock P. M. we came to camp on a low ſpot, on the eaſt-ſide, having gone done the river forty-two miles
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:014440_0344_0F92620F97375048"/>
and a half; all day dull weather, and at night rain.</p>
               <p n="8">8th. Proceeded half an hour after 8 A. M. and having gone a little more than a mile, we reached the mouth of the creek called <hi>Ectombogue bé</hi> (i. e.) Crooked Creek, on the weſt ſide; from this creek's name the French derive their <hi>Tombechbé,</hi> the name of the fort which ſtood here, and which has again given that name to the whole river. We went about half a mile further down, under a high and ſteep bank of chalky ſtone, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the ruins of the fort, by means of which the French kept all the ſavages in awe. I went aſhore in the old fields, and drew a view of the ruins; this is about forty miles eaſt from the town of <hi>Abeeka.</hi> The river is not ſixty feet wide here. About a mile and a half below theſe ruins is a pretty high, but ſloping ſlaty bluff: having come about nine miles, we arrived at a hunting camp of <hi>Chactaws,</hi> on the weſt ſide; who invited us on ſhore, treated us very kindly, and ſpared us ſome veniſon, bear's meat and oil. The af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon being ſtormy, with hail and rain, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped at a ſmall diſtance from them: the canes were not very plenty here, but the land rich: a great deal of the plant called <hi>Indian Hemp</hi> grows in this place; but the ſeaſon deprived me of the ſatisfaction of knowing what genus it is of.</p>
               <p n="9">9th. At half an hour paſt eleven proceeded, and in an hour and a quarter we paſſed by <hi>Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kianoeé,</hi> a white bluff, with a ſavannah on its top, on the weſt ſide; it is upwards of ſeventy feet high above the water's level: we paſt ſeveral high bluffs, among which one is yellow like <hi>Ochre.</hi> We ſaw many bars alſo, and lagoo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

having travelled twenty-four miles, came to camp at four o'clock P. M. on the eaſt ſide, at the beginning of a ſteep ſlaty bluff.</p>
               <p n="10">10th. At half an hour paſt nine, A. M. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded; we went between high bluffs, and in two hours time came to the mouth of <hi>Tuſcalooſa</hi> river from the eaſt; and a little below it is the ſteep white chalky bluff, on whoſe top is a vaſt plain, and ſome remains of huts in it, the bluff is called the <hi>Chicaſow Gallery,</hi> becauſe from here the ſavages uſed to annoy the French boats go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to the fort, or down from it. The river is hereabouts full of rapids, and bad paſſes: we came paſt a number of high bluffs, moſt of them chalky. At half an hour paſt three we paſt the mouth of <hi>Sookhanatcha</hi> from the weſt, and three miles below it came to camp, at four o'clock P. M. at the foot of the hill, where formerly the <hi>Cooſadas</hi> were ſettled: this place is called <hi>Sukta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looſa</hi> (i. e.) Black Bluff, from its being a kind of coal; it is a great thorough-fare for warring ſavages, therefore we took the uſual precaution of large fires, and hanging our hats on ſtakes, which we had reaſon to think not in vain; for in the night we heard the report of ſmall arms. This day we came thirty-ſix miles. It is worthy of remark, that although we have come ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſeventy miles from the ruins of <hi>Tombechbé,</hi> yet by land the diſtance is not above twenty-four, or twenty-five miles. The land here is very fine, and Mr. <hi>Dow</hi> told me, that he had lived here with the <hi>Cooſadas,</hi> and that the common yield of corn was from ſixty to eighty buſhels per acre; that they increaſed horſes and hogs to any degree

they pleaſed, and that veniſon, turkies and fiſh were uncommonly plenty.</p>
               <p n="11">11th. Laſt night and this morning, being rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, we could not proceed till eleven o'clock. All this day we paſſed through the remains of the <hi>Cooſada</hi> and <hi>Occhoy</hi> ſettlements, being all a fine tract of ground, of which much had been cleared; but it is now again overgrown with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

M. we encamped on a little plain, under a bluff, where was a large hunting camp, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance about two years old: here we ſaw ſome ſtones, having been deeply marked by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages, with ſome uncouth marks, but moſt of them being ſtraight lines and croſſed, i have ſince been led to conjecture, whether they were not occaſioned by theſe people grinding their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> near two miles below the deſerted <hi>Occhoy</hi> town, which ſtood likewiſe near a black coaly bluff; the diſtance we made this day is twenty one miles, we had fine weather during the day; but the night was ſhowery.</p>
               <p n="12">12th. At half an hour paſt eight A. M. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded. All this day we ſaw marks of great fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of ſoil, and much tolerably high land: at half an hour paſt ten, we were at a creek called <hi>Abeſhaï,</hi> at a quarter paſt eleven at the laſt <hi>Occhoy</hi> field, by a creek called <hi>Baſhailawaw;</hi> at eleven A. M. at the hills of <hi>Nanna Falaya,</hi> on the eaſt ſide; which riſe ſteep out of the water, about fifteen, or twenty feet, then ſlope up into very high ſhort pine hills. Some parts of the rock
<pb n="328" facs="unknown:014440_0347_0F9262121859CB90"/>
are red, others grey. Here we were overtaken by very bad weather, from which took ſhelter; at half an hour paſt one, P. M. we encamped about three quarters of a mile below the hill, on the ſlope of a pretty high bank, where we found the remains of a camp, that had been occupied lately by white people; we came about eleven miles and an half this day; the rain continued till two o'clock A. M. next day, when the wind ſhifting to W. N. W, it grew exceſſively cold.</p>
               <p n="13">13th. At half an hour paſt ten A. M. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded; at one o'clock we came to a hill on the eaſt ſide, with an old field on its ſummit; this hill is called <hi>Batcha-Chooka;</hi> here we found a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious gang of thieves, belonging to the town of <hi>Oka Looſa,</hi> a town in the Chactaw nation; when we ſaw their raft, we took them to be a Creek war party, therefore, being hailed by them, and not chooſing to be ſhot at, we went near the ſhore; but on diſcovering who they were i re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to land; they ſtill inſiſted we muſt, but my obſtinate perſiſting to the contrary diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed their ſanguine hopes of plunder; and after ſome altercation i proceeded. This day the marks of fertility of ſoil are not ſo uninterrupted as on the former days. Our weather was clear, and a ſtrong northerly wind prevailed;—we came nineteen miles ſince morning, and encamped on the weſt ſide, in a low ſpot of ground.</p>
               <p n="14">14th. Laſt night the froſt was ſevere; at a quarter paſt nine, A. M. proceeded;—in half an hour's time we ſaw very high hills, at a mile, or better, from the river, ſeemingly covered with pine timber; theſe hills the ſavages call <hi>Nanna Chahaws.</hi> Here is a ſteep place above forty feet
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:014440_0348_0F9262124F2D48D0"/>
perpendicular out of the water, and another ſteep above it; the laſt is a grey ſlaty rock; this place is called <hi>Teeakhaily Ekutapa,</hi> and the people from <hi>Chicaſahay</hi> had a ſettlement here before the war. About a mile and a quarter from hence is a remarkable white ſand hill on the eaſt ſide; four miles lower we came to <hi>Yagna-hoolah</hi> (i. e.) the Beloved Ground, which lies on the eaſt ſide, and is very high, continuing above two miles along the river bank; its lower part is ſteep and of a whitiſh grey, and at the end above two hundred feet high, reckoning perpendicularly. A mile below this is a white ſand hill on the weſt ſide; we ſaw the pine hills all this day, at various diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances from the river, ſometimes cloſe to it, and the canes brgin to diminiſh, and pine trees mix among the timber. The current for theſe two laſt days, is very conſiderably ſlackened, and the river widened to above five hundred feet. We came about thirty miles and an half this day, and encamped at four o'clock P. M. on the ſide of a kind of bluff, about ſix miles below a branch called <hi>Iſawaya:</hi> all day cold, the latter part and night dull and hazy, at a quarter paſt nine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded. Eight miles below our camp we were at the mouth of <hi>Senti Bogue</hi> (i. e.) Snake Creek, having an iſland in its mouth, and coming from the weſtward. Two miles and a quarter lower is <hi>Atchatickpé,</hi> a large bay, or lagoon, on the ſame ſide: at this place is the beginning of our boundary with the Chactaws, running from the weſt till it ſtrikes <hi>Senti-Bogue,</hi> and then follows the courſe of ſaid creek, up to a certain ſugar-loaf hill, and ſo over to <hi>Bogue Hooma,</hi> and <hi>Bak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>katanè.</hi> A mile below this, at the bending of
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:014440_0349_0F926212F0E24458"/>
the river is a bluff, but not very high, of a dark grey ſtone; above this it riſes gradually ſloping into a very high hill, variegated into ſmall ridges. We ſaw many ſpots of pines, and ſome white ſand hills; but in general the ſoil has a better appearance than yeſterday. About an hour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we encamped, we came to the laſt rapids, or the firſt from below; here is a remarkable ſpot of yellow rocks in the weſtern bank, beginning with a high, perpendicular, white rock, with ſome graſs ſpots; it is above fifty feet above the preſent ſurface of the water; its top is level and ſhrubby; in the middle projects a remarkable lump, which, in coming down looks exactly like a buttreſs againſt a wall. At four o'clock P. M. we encamped on the eaſt ſide in the low ground, above a mile below the rocks, having come thirty-one miles. The weather has been clear and cold all this day. Stout ſloops and ſchooners may come up to this rapid; therefore i judge that here ſome conſiderable ſettlement will take place.</p>
               <p n="16">16th. Proceeded at half an hour paſt eight, A. M. Having come about fifteen miles, we ſaw the remains of the old <hi>Weetumpkee</hi> ſettlement: about ſeven miles below this, on the eaſt ſide is an odd rocky bluff, appearing to be ſandy, and is covered with cedar trees. The river here is very crooked, and about ſix miles below on the weſt ſide, we ſaw a ſpacious old field, and a ſmoak in one edge of it; but nobody near it, and two miles lower down, hearing a ruſtling in the canes, we looked that way, and ſaw a ſavage in a war dreſs, lying flat; finding himſelf per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, he got up and beckoned to us; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:014440_0350_0F926219CEA71558"/>
we were within ten feet of him, we ſeemed not to have remarked him, upon which he lay down again: it is to be imagined that he was not alone, and that this was a war party, who had been at the ſmoak, in the old field, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perceived us, had come to this place, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that here we muſt come near the bank; but ſeeing that we were no <hi>Chactaws,</hi> and thinking themſelves undiſcovered, they kept cloſe. At a quarter paſt four o'clock, P. M. we came to a camp on the weſt-ſide, which we ſuppoſed by the boats, &amp;c. to be occupied by white people; in which opinion we were ſoon confirmed. When they invited us on ſhore, we found they were one <hi>Thomas Baſkett,</hi> with two white hunters, and ſome <hi>Chactaws;</hi> we were here well regaled with excellent meat, and very good bread, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prepared in an excellent manner, was a noble feaſt to us. I purchaſed ſome bear, bacon and veniſon hams of them, and ſtaid all night at their camp; the diſtance we came this day was thirty-one miles.</p>
               <p n="17">17th. Embarked at half an hour paſt nine, A. M. and proceeded, accompanied by two ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes with ſavages: we ſoon paſt by ſome high pine hills on the eaſt-ſide; and at their end, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come about two miles, we were at the little creek called <hi>Apé Bogue oosè,</hi> which is a ſpring ſo intenſely ſalt, that the ſavages told us, three kettles of its water, yields one of ſalt. Having then proceeded for four hours through low land on each ſide, we arrived at the place called by the French, <hi>The Forks</hi> being a lagoon divided into three branches, whereof the firſt is called <hi>Apè Tonſa,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Beelofa,</hi> and the third <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>äntacalamoo:</hi>
                  <pb n="332" facs="unknown:014440_0351_0F92621BAFC61A40"/>
here the ſavages left us; we ſtill proceeded for half an hour more through low land, and then came to a large bay, at the end whereof begins the <hi>Tomeehettee</hi> bluff, where for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly a tribe of that nation reſided; this is the firſt time we have the real pine barren butting on the river, it is very level. About five miles below this place, we came to the firſt iſlands that are of note; the land continues low and pretty rich: here we ſee the firſt ſummer canes. At ſix o'clock P. M. we came to the <hi>Cooſadas</hi> bluff, having had the <hi>Naniabè</hi> (i. e.) Fiſh Killer's iſland above an hour on our weſt ſide; this place was the laſt ſettlement of the <hi>Cooſadas,</hi> after they left <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We paſt the <hi>Nita Abè,</hi> or Bear Killer's Bluff on the left, and at nine o'clock P. M. we came to the north end of the iſland, which divides the branch called <hi>Dog River,</hi> from the weſt branch of the river. Here we ſtaid all night at the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the <hi>Chevalier de Lucere,</hi> but found only three or four old ſlaves and children, the whole of the able hands, and the overſeer, being gone to make tar-kilns, ſo that we had but indifferent fare. We came this day forty-two miles and an half. N. B. Thoſe iſlands are very fertile, and have a great many plantations on them, on the branches which lay out of our way, particularly on the <hi>Taënſa,</hi> and <hi>Dog Rivers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">18th. At a quarter paſt nine, A.

where i ſtaid in order to get ſome refreſhment; this being the firſt Chriſtian habitation i had been at ſince the 20th September, laſt year. Mr. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vre</hi> treated us in a moſt friendly, genteel and hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitable manner. At one o'clock ſome boats went up the river, which i heard were Mr. <hi>Stuart</hi>'s people, with a provincial deputy ſurveyor, going up to aſcertain the boundary between us and the <hi>Chactaws.</hi> At two o'clock ſome gentlemen, among whom was Major <hi>Dixon,</hi> of the ſixteenth regiment, and <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> deputy ſuperinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant of Indian affairs (to whom i deſcribed <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chatikpè</hi> and <hi>Senti-Bogue,</hi> where they were to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin) followed them: they proceeded up to Mr. <hi>Stuart</hi>'s plantation, about three miles higher up the river. We had come ſeven miles and a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this day. In the afternoon it began to rain, and all night was a prodigious ſtorm of wind and rain, which i had the pleaſure of weathering out under a good roof: here we found ſeveral fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of <hi>Chactaw</hi> ſavages.</p>
               <p n="19">19th. At a quarter paſt nine, A.

Having gone five miles and three quarters, we paſſed by the ruins of <hi>Fort Condè,</hi> or old <hi>Mobile,</hi> and near ſix miles lower down we paſt by the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins of a fine plantation, formerly belonging to the French Intendant at Mobile, now to Mr. <hi>Lizars</hi> at the ſame place: 4 miles and 3 quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters lower down we met with the firſt marſh, the river being very full, we could not learn how far the ſalt water had its effect, the bay itſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freſh and good at this time; but Mr. <hi>Dow,</hi>

Nine miles up the river <hi>Yaſoo</hi> found Captain <hi>Enos,</hi> and thoſe that went with him, at a place where it is ſaid the <hi>French</hi> formerly had a fort and ſettlement; the bank on the right hand, going up at this place, is a high ridge of rocks, with a fine ſpring of water, falling from the <hi>quarne,</hi> the <hi>Yaſoo</hi> river is about four hundred, or five hundred feet broad, its courſe is eaſt, about two miles and an half up N.

               <p>It may, perhaps, be agreeable to the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Eaſt and Weſt-Florida, who become purchaſers of this work, to have a copy of ſuch articles of the late treaty of peace, in 1762, as immediately concern them.

               <p>Article II.

His <hi>Britannick</hi> Majeſty, on his ſide, agrees to grant to the inhabitants of <hi>Canada,</hi> the liberty of the <hi>Catholick</hi> religion, he will in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence give the moſt exact, and the moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual orders, that his new <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may profeſs the worſhip of their religion, according to the rites of the <hi>Roman</hi> church, as far as the laws of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> permit. His <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannick</hi> Majeſty further agrees, that the <hi>French</hi> inhabitants, or others, who would have been ſubjects of the <hi>Moſt Chriſtian</hi> King in <hi>Canada,</hi> may retire in all ſafety and freedom, where ever they pleaſe, and may ſell their eſtates, provided it be to his <hi>Britannick</hi> Majeſty's ſubjects, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their effects, as well as their perſons, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being reſtrained in their emigration, under any pretence whatſoever, except debts or crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal proſecutions; the term limited for this emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration being fixed to the ſpace of eighteen months, to be computed from the day of the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the definitive treaty.</p>

            <head>APPENDIX.</head>
            <p>THE following directions to navigators were originally intended as an appendix to the whole work; but i have ſince found it requiſite to publiſh them ſooner; and therefore end this firſt volume with that neceſſary part of my work.</p>
            <p>Theſe directions i beg leave to affirm, are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely founded on my own experience; the firſt ſpur to this undertaking was the loſs of a veſſel in 1766, on the coaſt of <hi>Florida:</hi> by which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a wound in my circumſtances, which is as yet far from being healed. I had before this, in the ſame veſſel, at a time when I was myſelf on board, ſtruck on the ſouth part of the <hi>Dry Tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> when having accidentally a tolerable pilot with me, i paſſed for the firſt time, in-ſide of the reef; and made my firſt obſervations towards this preſent work: Since that i have purſued it part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly during the opportunities i had at the time when i was a provincial deputy ſurveyor, and partly when i was appointed deputy for the ſouthern di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrict of <hi>America;</hi> and had the honor of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the veſſels on that ſervice. Likewiſe, while employed by the ſuperintendant in <hi>Weſt-Florida;</hi> but far moſt at my own great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and fatigue. For even when i was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, i can ſafely affirm, that when i could do it without detriment to the ſervice, and at times when i did that buſineſs, in a manner which is vulgarly called <hi>by the jobb,</hi> i have done more than was deſired of me; which, however, has never
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:014440_0365_0F92622AF8D4F728"/>
been the occaſion of any favor being beſtowed on me, any more than <hi>you did well, and i am glad you did it.</hi> Therefore i am under no manner of obligation to any of the LITTLE GREAT ONES, who have occaſionally uſed me, (ſometimes as the monkey did the cat) and this production being undoubtedly my own, as ſuch i have a right to publiſh it.</p>
            <p>Thus having ſhewn how i got my information, i declare myſelf free of copying or compiling from prior works, except in that part lying weſt from the <hi>Miſſiſippi,</hi> which is taken from <hi>French manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript</hi> draughts; and the ſhape of the coaſt and bays eaſtward from <hi>Penſacola,</hi> to <hi>Cape St. Blas,</hi> which i have followed from draughts occaſionally ſeen in the hands of Mr. <hi>Stuart,</hi> (the ſuper-inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant) and my good friend Dr. <hi>J. Lorimer,</hi> which draughts i take to be the work of Mr. <hi>Gauld,</hi> a very able and accurate obſerver; but though i kept the ſhape, the diſtances are different from his; and are ſuch as i have reaſon to believe nearer the mark, during a long and tedious cruize i made on this coaſt in 1771. As for the ſoundings, i never had his draughts long enough, to have an opportunity of peruſing them, but they are ſuch as i have obtained during the ſame tedious cruize; as for thoſe from <hi>Cape St. Blas,</hi> round to <hi>St. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s, i have obtained them during the regular pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of gaining ſurveys of the coaſt for above ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years.</p>
            <p>And as i have in the opinion of many of my friends in my propoſals publiſhed before i begun this work, reflected a little too ſeverely on the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed map-makers who have attempted to explain

this ſo intricate navigation, it is ſtill my opinion, that ſuch exhibitions can not be too much deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed, when attempted on ſo looſe a foundation, as has been generally done; and we muſt ſtill form a worſe idea of thoſe who impoſe on the public againſt their better knowledge. Both the one and the other has been done. I therefore publiſh the preſent work with no other view than that of pointing out the ſad miſtakes of the ſcandalous maps daily publiſhed by perſons who either not at all, or at beſt ſcarce ever ſaw the ground they treat of, and thus merely for the ſake of catching a penny, endanger ſuch numbers of lives, and ſuch a vaſt deal of property;—ſuch impoſters are the ſhame of the nation to which they belong.</p>
            <p>I have carefully avoided the change of well-known names of places; but preſerved the old ones, except only in two or three places where the name was not well known, or where there was none at all. Nothing can be more abſurd, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of confuſion, than the aſſuming new and fantaſtical names in places of ſo much danger; yet the author of a certain pamphlet, publiſhed two years ago, has done this at no ſmall rate.</p>
            <p>And for the ſafety of navigation, i think it a duty incumbent on me, to declare that the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of what the ſaid author calls the <hi>Newfound paſſage</hi> or <hi>channel</hi> (altho the knowledge thereof is as old as that of <hi>America</hi> itſelf) are marked much deeper than they really are; and whoever depends on that pamphlet, will find himſelf much impoſed upon; nor do i think my work to be abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly clear of faults; no, but i venture to ſay, that the errors are very few; and as they are unknown
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:014440_0367_0F92622C71664D20"/>
to me, therefore, whatever miſtakes may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, if communicated by men of knowledge, i ſhall gladly receive, and willingly amend them.</p>
            <p>Veſſels bound from <hi>Europe</hi> to <hi>St. Auguſtine, Georgia,</hi> or <hi>South-Carolina,</hi> would (in my opinion) ſhorten their paſſages conſiderably, by making the ſouth end of <hi>Abaco,</hi> or the <hi>Hole in the Rock,</hi> in lat. 26° 4′ and from that run WbS to make the <hi>Berry-Iſlands;</hi> from thence WbN, or WNW, till they get into the gulph ſtream; the only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution to be obſerved is to ſteer to the weſtward of north, after you are clear of the <hi>Grand Bahama</hi> iſland, becauſe the bank ſtretches NbW nearly, and the current ſets partly on the NW part of the bank; particularly near the <hi>member</hi> or <hi>memory rock.</hi> You may, in caſe of neceſſity, venture on the bank, to the ſouth of the rock, and beat up to the eaſtward, till you bring the rock to bear WNW, and you will not find leſs than five fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms water:—The tide ebbs and flows here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout five feet, but you cannot come out on the north of the rock; however, by keeping in the ſtream, i dare venture to ſay you will find a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble benefit in coming this way.</p>

leſs than 3 fathoms, though by keeping out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 5 or 6 miles from the ſhore, you will find generally 5 or 6 fathoms, on a fine ſandy bottom; and when you approach the reef, you may haul in, obſerving to leave the reef a large piece without you, for it has many bad ſand bars juſt on its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner edge: you will not find leſs than 3 fathoms, any where within, till you come a breaſt the ſouth end of the key, where there is a ſmall bank of 11 feet only, give the key a good birth, for there is a large flat ſtretching off from it. At the ſouth end of the key, very good water is obtainable by digging, but at a time when by accident of drought or other ways, the wells yield none, then the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering places either in the grand marſh, about 10 miles to the W by S; or the river <hi>Ratones,</hi> about as far to the N W of the key, may be always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon; at the watering place on the key, is alſo an excellent place for careening of veſſels, not exceeding ten feet draught. All theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous circumſtances, joined to ſome of the ſame kind at the <hi>Bemini</hi> iſlands, make this an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſtation for cruizers to watch every veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel bound northward; on the bank without the <hi>Bemini</hi> harbour is good anchorage for large veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. The method i would recommend, is to have two veſſels, one to ſerve as a tender to the larger one, and while the one is on the <hi>Bemini</hi> ſide, the other ought to be on the <hi>Florida</hi> ſide; by this means (the paſſage being only 15 leagues wide) no veſſel could come through during day, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being ſeen by one or the other; and as it is always poſſible to get out-ſide of the reef, except with a ſtrong N, or N E wind, and flood tide; i

need not direct ſeamen how to proceed, in order to ſpeak with any veſſel they chance to ſee. The many breaks that are in the reef, make it not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable that a paſſage might be found through even with a N or N E gale. As for the ſafety in laying within ſide, every ſeaman knows that a reef makes a ſafe harbour; good ground-tackling is the principal point; ſhould a chace lead you far north in the ſtream, there is no difficulty in reaching your ſtation again; all that's neceſſary, is to make the land as ſoon as you can, only avoid <hi>Cape Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naveral,</hi> in lat. 28°: 30′; to the ſouth of it, you may make pretty free with the ſhore, except in the bight north of <hi>Rio d'ais,</hi> where there is but 12 feet a league off. To the ſouth of 26°: 50′, to about 26 there is 7 fathoms at the very beach: here you muſt hug the ſhore cloſe, becauſe the ſtream almoſt touches the beach: I was once in great danger hereabouts, by the ill working of the veſſel I was in, and had juſt time to let go an anchor in 9 fathoms, and when the veſſel rode to it, it would have been an eaſy matter for a man to have jumped off from the tafferel on the beach; the beach here is for the moſt part ſmooth enough for a canoe to land; there being little or no ſurf on it in good weather.</p>
               <p>In the year 1773, i came a paſſage from <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſſippi,</hi> on board the ſchooner <hi>Liberty,</hi> commanded by capt. <hi>John Hunt,</hi> we had the misfortune to be over-ſet at ſea, and i conducted the wreck into this place, when having loſt our boat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſand off, to make a kind of cabooſe. I mention this the more, becauſe there is water obtainable in almoſt every place on this beach, in caſe of neceſſity. But to return to my ſubject, to keep the ſhore on board is the way to get to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward here; and as on the ſoundings, the current is chiefly ruled by the wind, it is preferable to come to an anchor with a ſoutherly wind, inſtead of ſtanding out; for the ſtream will run you out in ſuch a manner, that you will find it difficult to regain in four or five days, the ground you loſe in one. Yet i would avoid anchoring as much as poſſible, becauſe the ground to the ſouth of 27° is almoſt every where very foul, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, if you caſt deeper than 15 fathoms: by obſerving this method, you will find it an eaſy matter to regain your ſtation to the ſouthward.</p>
               <p>At this place there is vaſt abundance and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of fiſh, both in the creeks, and out-ſide at ſea, particularly <hi>groopers</hi> are in great plenty, <hi>king-fiſh, Spaniſh mackrel</hi> and <hi>Barrows</hi> are alſo often caught towing; and if you have one or two good hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters on board, you may always be provided with plenty of veniſon, turkies and bear meat, which are all excellent refreſhment, There are for the moſt part deer on the key, and ſometimes bear; but by ſending to the main, you may depend on finding every kind; in winter, duck and teal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in the creeks; turtle is very plenty; in ſhort, i know not any place better calculated for a cruizer, than the ſpot i have now deſcribed; add to this, that no fiſh is poiſonous on the <hi>Florida</hi> ſhore, not even the <hi>amber-fiſh;</hi> but on the <hi>Baha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> ſide <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The channel from bank to bank, is here about 14 leagues a-croſs; but to reach the bank, you ought to ſteer S. E. over from this ſtation.</p>
               <p>If from this place a chace ſhould lead you northward, your endeavours ought to be to make <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s <hi>Rocks,</hi> or from <hi>Key-Biſcayno,</hi> above deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed, to fall in with the <hi>Bemini,</hi> which is by no means difficult; the laſt is the moſt eligible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the bank is broad, whereas at <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s <hi>Rocks</hi> you have no ſoundings in leſs than a cables length from the ſhore, and conſequently if you cannot make good a ſouth courſe, you will be obliged to anchor on the north ſide of the rocks, and thus delay much time; but in making the <hi>Bermini,</hi> which lies nearly ſouth 7 leagues from the rock, you may keep on ſoundings on the bank; the ſounding however, as far as <hi>Beak's Key,</hi> is not very wide. <hi>Beak's-Key</hi> lies S ½ E 7½ leagues from <hi>Bemini;</hi> from <hi>Beak</hi>'s-<hi>Key,</hi> to the <hi>Riding Rocks,</hi> and <hi>Roques,</hi> there is working room plenty, and good anchorage; at <hi>Orange-Key</hi> is a good road to the S and S W of it; this key lies S S E 8 leagues from <hi>Beak</hi>'s-<hi>Key;</hi> from <hi>Orange-Key</hi> it is an eaſy matter to get to the <hi>Double-Headed-Shot;</hi> the way is to ſail early in the morning, ſteering S W; when you have run about 10 leagues on that courſe, you may begin to look out for <hi>Key-Sal</hi> bank; where, in caſe of need, you may anchor any where; the <hi>Dog-Keys,</hi> and <hi>Dead-man's-Keys,</hi>

ſhew themſelves eaſily, lying on the N W and W part of this bank; they are bold too yet dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; the ſoundings are narrow near them from here you may either make the <hi>Cuba</hi> ſhore, or run a-croſs W N W, about 14 or 15 leagues, which will bring you in with the <hi>Florida</hi> reef, to the ſouthward of your former ſtation.</p>
               <p>You may from <hi>Key-Biſcayo,</hi> come ſouthwards along the <hi>Florida</hi> ſhore, on the out-ſide of the reef; but as the ſounding is very narrow, this way is by no means adviſeable; except in fine and moderate weather, when you may keep your boats out, for the winds hereabouts being chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the eaſtern quarter make the reef a very dangerous lee; whereas the <hi>Bahama</hi> ſide is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſafe. From <hi>Key-Tabona,</hi> to the N W about a mile lies a very ſmall key called <hi>Key-Palombo</hi> or <hi>Dove-Key;</hi> which in many ſeaſons affords good water, but that is ſeldom; at about ten miles S W from <hi>Key-Tabona</hi> is <hi>Matacombe,</hi> here are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral never-failing wells of excellent water in a rock; whether theſe are natural, or artificial is hard to tell: ſhould theſe wells by accident of extreme drought happen to fail, which i believe next to impoſſible, you would in that caſe be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to ſend for water to <hi>Key-Biſcayo;</hi> which is near 20 leagues from here. Fiſh and turtle are in as great plenty here, as at <hi>Biſcayo. Matacombe</hi> yields a few deer of a ſmall kind; but large deer, bear, and turkeys are not to be had without going to the main for them. I was once in great want of proviſions at <hi>Matacombe,</hi> and ſent a hunter with a boy in a ſkiff to the weſtward, at <hi>Sandy-point</hi> or <hi>Cape-Sable;</hi> whence he returned in a few

               <p>The third ſtation is at <hi>Cayo-Hueſos,</hi> common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called <hi>Key-Weſt;</hi> this place is beſt calculated to watch thoſe veſſels which come from <hi>La Vera Cruz, Campeche, Siſal,</hi> &amp;c. Few of thoſe that are bound through the gulph come this way. There is a harbour, or rather a road ſtead inſide of the weſtermoſt point of the key; but it is very unſafe in northern and weſtern gales; and the ground is foul; ſo that in caſe of notherly or northweſterly winds, it is beſt to lay out-ſide; therefore at the ſeaſon when <hi>Norths</hi> are frequent, it is not adviſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to lay within ſide, except for the purpoſe of hiding yourſelf: there is 20 to 24 feet going in to this place; and the way in, is to keep cloſe on board the weſt ſide of the ſandy key, which lies about 9 miles to the S E of the weſt point of the key; draw cloſe enough along-ſide of it to chuck a biſcuit aſhore; and then ſteer directly for the weſt point of the great key, which point is bare, except one buſh of trees which you will ſee on it: when you come cloſe in, give it a birth, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a ſmall bank lying on the out-ſide of it; to go further in you will ſee a black ſpot, being a ſmall reef to the north of you, avoid this and ſhoot in to the eaſtward; your eye will be your guide; on the point are wells, but the water is indifferent; half a mile to the eaſtward is a path leading to very good water; on this key we find numbers of deer (of the ſmall kind) generally ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good: this place lies right in the way of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſhips, from the weſtward; on account

               <p>Next we meet an even ſmooth beach, from here to <hi>Caneveral,</hi> excepting <hi>Mount Tucker,</hi> which lies about 5 leagues ſouth of the entrance of <hi>Muſkeeto</hi> River; this beech extends for 52 ſtatute mile (equal to 15 Engliſh leagues) on a courſe S E b S: and here we find regular ſoundings as above, until we come to the cape which lies within a large and dangerous ſhoal, leaving a ſmall channel between it and the land, as the draught expreſſes; the outer pitch of this head land lies in latitude 28° 16, and longitude 80° 28′ W. from London, and the pitch of the ſhoal extends 8 leagues eaſt from it: in ſo much that when you are on the outer breaker, land is ſcarce viſible from it; this remarkable ſhoal was never heretofore laid down in any map or chart for marine uſe, yet i am ſenſible that it is very dangerous; and i believe many veſſels have been loſt on it, the circumſtances of whoſe misfortunes were never heard of; the wind on blowing a long and violent gale from ENE to SE makes this ſhoal almoſt unavoidable, to a veſſel ſailing in this latitude, not having a very large offing.</p>

ground foul, except cloſe in, where there are ſome ſtones, and the remains of a wreck; in this lagoon and ſound many ſtreams of fine freſh water empty themſelves; the principal are the rivers St. <hi>Sebaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> and St. <hi>Lucia</hi> as the map ſhews.</p>
               <p>From the entrance of <hi>Indian</hi> river the coaſt ſtretches S 26 E or nearly S E b S ½ S 11¼ leagues, (anſwering to nearly 39 ſtatute miles as meaſured on the beach) it makes an iſland, at whoſe South end is an inlet into the above ſound, the Spaniards call it <hi>Hobe;</hi> it will only allow of five foot draught, this inlet lies in lat. 26° 46′ long. 79° 40′ weſt from London: to the north of it, on the point at its entrance, lies a remarkable ſpot of rocks on the beach, as there is alſo at 1½ leagues to the northward of ſaid entrance, and 3 leagues further north are ſeveral high blue or black rocks ſtanding on the beach, theſe rocks make this part of the coaſt remarkable, as does likewiſe a hill inland full of white ſpots, a little to the north of the rocks inland; this hill is called the <hi>Bleech-Yard.</hi> A ſmall reef juſt under water about half a mile from the ſhore abreaſt of the high rocks, forms here a convenient little harbour for boats, there are two wells of excellent water in a little meadow, back of the ſand hills, near a mile to the ſouth of the high rocks; the river St. <hi>Lucia</hi> likewiſe ſhews its mouth over the ſound, when you ſtand on the northermoſt high rock: the wells have caſks in them, &amp; this is in my opinion a very good watering place for veſſels who having had a tedious paſſage through the gulph, are in want of a ſupply of this neceſſary article; this iſland af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords abundance of turtle, veniſon, and bear; as
<pb n="xix" facs="unknown:014440_0382_0F926245F0C4ECA0"/>
likewiſe numerous quantities of wild ducks, each in their ſeaſon, beſides <hi>cocoplumbs</hi> and <hi>palm cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage;</hi> and on the main oppoſite, turkeys are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant. The northermoſt of the high rock lies in lat. 26° 56. N. the coaſt is even, bold too; and the ſoundings regular.</p>
               <p>We have now reached the ſouthern extremity of the great bank of regular ſoundings which lies before the coaſt of America, and here the gulph ſtream comes very near the beach; the color of the water changes from a muddy green, to a beautiful ſaxon blue.</p>
               <p>From Hobé inlet we find the coaſt trenching about S 20 E or nearly SSE for about 3½ leagues to a high ledge of rocks, out of which a large ſtream of freſh water ruſhes into the ſea, a little to the north hereof is a ſmall reef with about 2 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms water on it, where vaſt quantites of groop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſnappers, amber-fiſh, porgys, margate-fiſh, rock-fiſh, yellow-tails, Jew-fiſh, &amp;c. may be tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en; from this reef you ſee a high mount of ſand &amp; rocks a little to the north of you, three miles to the north of which is good freſh water, at the back of an high ſand hill; as there is alſo a little more than half a mile to the ſouthward of ſaid rocky mount, this mount we called Grooper-Hill, it is a remarkable land, <hi>cabbage</hi> trees, <hi>cocoplumbs,</hi> and ſea grapes are here in abundance, as are veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and other meat; ſo that in fair weather a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel may refreſh here agreeably; the ſoundings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long all this coaſt are plainly and truly marked in the map: the coaſt from here runs very nearly ſouth, &amp; the beach is bold too, to within 2 leagues of <hi>Rio Del Medio,</hi> it does not vary above half a

point either way from this general ſouth courſe all the way to <hi>Cayo Biſcayno</hi> in lat. 25° 35. lon. 79° 36 W from London; as it is neceſſary for veſſels bound ſouthward to keep this beach cloſe on board, i ſhall diſcribe it particularly, in hopes that this treatiſe may prove a certain guide in every part of this difficult navigation.</p>
               <p>Five leagues to the ſouth of the above point or ledge of rocks, out of which a large ſpring of water iſſues; there is another ledge of rocks, and 1½ mile to the north of it ſtands a very tall tree by ſome freſh water, a large quarter of a mile to the ſouth of this tree is a low ſand hill, full of dry trees, whereby it may be known.</p>
               <p>This laſt ledge of rocks is 1½ miles in length, ſomewhat more than 2 miles ſouth of theſe, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother point of rocks, theſe are very low; 1½ miles further is a high cabbage grove, and about 3 1-2 miles further ſouth is a point of high rocks near ¾ of a mile long, 2¾ miles further yet is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther high point of rocks about ¼ of a mile long, &amp; half a mile ſouth of this is the mouth of <hi>Rio Seco</hi> which is very ſeldom open, having a narrow bar of dry ſand before it, the coaſt forms here a ſmall kind of cove, which makes a good road ſtead for ſmall craft, this river is in lat. 26° 16 N long. 79° 35; 5 miles to the ſouth of Rio Seco is another point of rocks, and ſouth of it a ſmall bite, and half a mile further is the mouth of <hi>Rio Nuevo,</hi> which is about ¼ of a mile wide and generally open but ſhallow, here Jew-fiſh are very abundant both within and without the river; 2¼ miles ſouth of this river's mouth are five tall cabbage trees on the pine land; and 4½ miles further is a

thick ſcrubby point, and the ſand hills in general are high and covered with thick buſhes; here the ſhore is no longer ſo bold as before, but a bank of ſoundings about 5 leagues broad begins to cover the beach, and this (in my opinion) is the true begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the great Florida reef, 5 miles S of this is the north end of a marſhy point which extends ¼ of a mile to the mouth of <hi>Rio Del Medio,</hi> which is likewiſe a quarter of a mile acroſs and ſhallow but very full of Jew-fiſh. From this river the beach has nothing obſervable on it except that its hills are higher than further north, and are covered with ſhrubs and trees. At 10 miles ſouth of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, is a remarkable ſpot of palm-trees. We ſee water over the land, and the coaſt is flat, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not above 12 foot within a mile and more of the coaſt &amp; the bottom ſolid rocks, about 8 miles ſouth of the aforeſaid palm trees is the mouth of <hi>Boca Ratones</hi> which will admit ſmall craft, but has a reef ſtretching a conſiderable way to ſea.</p>
               <p>South of <hi>Boca Ratones</hi> about 5 miles, is the ſouth point of an iſland, which has ſillily been called <hi>Cape Florida,</hi> but ſince has acquired the name of <hi>Fools Cape,</hi> ſouth of this point is a channel of a mile in width, having 6 foot water at the beſt of times, the oppoſite land on the ſouth of ſaid channel is the north point of Key Biſcay, which is near 5 miles long from north to ſouth; this key is particularly deſcribed in the beginning of this tract, as is alſo the entrance into its har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and its advantagious ſituation for cruizers, likewiſe the watering places on and near it; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly eaſt from it 6 miles lie the <hi>Fowey</hi> rocks, which are the firſt dry ſpot on the reef, and have many bad bars within them, the key has

likewiſe a bank lying off of it, but by good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement in giving the key about 1 1-2 or 2 miles birth you are ſure to keep in a good channel, and till you come abreaſt the <hi>Soldier Keys</hi> or <hi>La Parida</hi> you will not have leſs than 16 foot water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>La Parida y ſu Jiguelo,</hi> or as we call them <hi>Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers Keys</hi> are two low ſpots of mangrove on a bank, their diſtance from the ſouth end of Key Biſcay is 3 miles and they are inacceſſible to any thing but a boat, the map will clearly ſhew their ſituation. Let it be obſerved that beſides the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering places above mentioned, there are many more and that the beach will almoſt in every part yield good drinkable water for digging, provided the ſand does not cover clay, wherever clay ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears on the beach the labour would be needleſs.</p>
               <p>Having now particularly and minutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the ſhore, and the manner of going cloſe along it, in order that this little tract may be as much as poſſible a perfect coaſting pilot in this part of the world. I ſhall ſubjoin ſome</p>

In continuing from here S E b S you will go along ſhore at an offing of 4 or 4½ leagues; in your way you will meet with ſoundings from

10 to 15 fathoms, chiefly on various kinds of ſand, as the charts fully ſhew; and ſometimes you will meet with a very ſoft greeniſh mud, in which the lead will ſink to over the ſtrap. All the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are in the charts laid down in feet, my lines of which i made uſe, being all marked with that meaſure.</p>
               <p>The above offing you may with ſafety keep in with veſſels of any draught for 25 leagues to the S E ward of the <hi>Matanca;</hi> you will begin to get ſhells among your ſoundings at 20 leagues, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly white and black, ſometimes mixed with black and grey ſand, but moſtly the ſhells by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, very ſeldom ſand alone, if you chance to find ſand only, it will be a coarſe grey kind; at 25 leagues as above, you will begin to get red ſhells, this is a true ſign that you approach the Cape <hi>Canaveral</hi> ſhoal, there being no red ſhells far to the north of it; now you may begin to haul off, tho' you might continue ſafely until 7 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms, or in the day time even in three; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the depth half a mile without the outer break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: in hauling off, you will find from 10 to 12 fathoms ſand &amp; ſhells, and if you come near to the north eaſt end of the ſhoal, you will often find live cockles, on a black ſandy bottom, in 10 or 11 fathoms; your offing will be made good on a courſe S E b E from the firſt caſt on red ſhells, till you judge yourſelf about 9 leagues off, then if you chuſe to make <hi>Indian River</hi> in lat. 27°: 15 run ſouth.

part of the ſhore, obſerve when you begin to get very coarſe black ſand: and black ſhells, for ſoon after you will find your bottom changed to white ſand, and your water to deepen; when you find 16 fathoms on white ſand, you begin to run clear of it, and in 20 or 21 fathoms, you are quite clear, then in continuing the ſame courſe your water again ſhoals, and in a run of about three leagues you once more find red ſhells, mix'd with black, and red ſand, continuing a great way; you ſtill ſhoal your water, and when you come in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 11 fathoms, you will have ſhells alone, without ſand:—all this while you ſee no land, it making a bay to the ſouth of the cape, till you come into about 9 fathoms, when you can juſt ſee the <hi>Tortolas,</hi> ſome hills ſo called, in lat. 27°: 35 N. If you want to call at <hi>Indian River</hi> inlet, it is now time to haul in a little for the land; from the <hi>Tortolas</hi> ſouthward you will again find ſand, ſometimes without ſhells; from the 9 fathoms above mentioned, it is 8 leagues to the river's mouth.</p>
               <p>Here obſerve, that between this inlet, and the Cape <hi>Canaveral,</hi> the coaſt is flat, and not to be truſted ſo much as the ſhore north of the cape.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe obſerve that the red ſhells extend no further ſouth than this inlet, and but a little way north of the cape ſhoal; whereby you have an infallible mark in coming well in upon ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, either from the ſouthward or northward, whereby to know that you are in with, or near to the cape ſhoal, if even you ſhould chance to have been without any obſervation for ſeveral days.</p>

                  <hi>Maſcaras;</hi> the meaning of which word is, that they are but juſt above water. There are ſome mangrove and blackwood buſhes on them. Their trenching is neatly to S S W. Next to theſe is a ſmall iſland, on which are two ſmall hills, whence the Spaniards have called it <hi>Las Tetas,</hi> or the <hi>Paps;</hi> but the Providence peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have ſtiled it <hi>Saunders's Key,</hi> and the inlet to the ſouth of it <hi>Saunders's Cut,</hi> where a ſmall veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel drawing about 4 foot, may enter into the wide ſound between theſe keys and the watering places on the main.</p>
               <p>Near 5 miles S S W of this is an inlet called Black Caeſars Creek, made by the ſouth end of <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>Next is a ſmall key which does not exceed two miles in length, at its ſouth end is an inlet known by the name of Angel Fiſh Creek; to the ſouth of this are two very ſmall keys, and the next is an iſland about 5 miles in length, to which no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular name has yet been given.

Point is directly ſouth 2 leagues. Sound Point is the eaſtermoſt part of the land called Key Largo, though in reality it is no iſland, but a peninſula, joined by a narrow iſthmus to the main, as the maps accurately ſhew. This place was till 1769, always taken for an iſland, and together with all the keys from <hi>Las Tetas,</hi> and the two next to the S W of this peninſula, been known by the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iards under the appellations of <hi>Cayo De doze Leg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas</hi> and <hi>Cayo Largo,</hi> which laſt name we have adopted, and by it, it is known to every one.</p>
               <p>The general rule to ſail within the reef from the <hi>Soldiers Key</hi> to the ſouthward is, to have a careful man at maſthead to look out, he will ſee all the heads and other ſhoals a good way off in a clear day, at leaſt a mile; thus making the e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> heads are very frequent, and the bar of ſaid Creek reaches a great way out. A little north of this inlet the ſnow <hi>Ledbury</hi> was burnt, after a vaſt deal of trouble, expence and pains taken to get her off. Right a breaſt of this ſpot, and north of the bar, is very fine anchorage in 12 foot cloſe to the back of the reef, which makes the inlet afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. On the point of this reef lies the remains of the ſhip <hi>Hubbard,</hi> caſt away in 1772.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Saunders's Cut</hi> to <hi>Sound Point</hi> there is only 11 foot of water to be depended on if you keep in that part of the channel which is cleareſt of rocks: you may carry more by going out further to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

the reef: but the care neceſſary to he tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en for the avoiding of the heads, is inconceivable. The bottom to <hi>Black Caeſar's Creek</hi> is ſand, but from thence to the S W ward it gradually chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es into a kind of ſoft marl of the conſiſtence of dough. When you are well clear of <hi>Angel Fiſh Creek</hi> to the ſouth, the ſame rule of keeping with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in 18 and 12 feet depth for the channel is to be obſerved; but after all a careful inſpection of my charts, together with a compariſon of them with the courſe of the land you ſail by, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially a good look out, will conſtitute you a better pilot than any directions that can be given for this navigation.</p>
               <p>The latitude of <hi>Sound Point</hi> is 25°: 12′ aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by ſeveral good obſervations. It is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to mention that the long diſputed ſituation of <hi>Cape Florida,</hi> is obviouſly fixed in this point; any mariner that ſails along this coaſt, will by the ſmalleſt attention to the changes of his courſe, find that it is the only ſpot that forms a true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory, from the <hi>Spring in the Rock</hi> in lat. 26° 46, down to here, in the manner as my charts ſhew.</p>
               <p>It is on this promontory that almoſt every veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel that is caſt away meets her fate, i mean on the large reef that lies before it; the ſouth point of which is dry, and forms a deep channel to go in towards two little keys called <hi>Rodriguez</hi> and <hi>Tabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;</hi> and its north point extends as far north as Angel Fiſh Creek. The people who watch thoſe misfortunes to make a benefit by them, know this ſo well that during the ſummer months, the ſeaſon for the return of ſhips from <hi>Jamaica,</hi> they ſtation themſelves at anchor a little ſouth of the
<pb n="xxx" facs="unknown:014440_0393_0F9261522ECD4708"/>
point from whence they can with certainty wait for the ſight of any ſhip that is unhappy enough to be drove on ſhore on this reef.</p>
               <p>Since i have mentioned theſe people, i cannot forbear taking notice of the abuſe generally thrown upon them very undeſervedly. I know of more inſtances than one, where they have been ill treated for their ſervices. What the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of the wreckers is in the windward paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, i cannot determine; but i appeal to every candid man, who has been ſo unfortunate as to have occaſion for the help of the turtlers and wood-cutters, who frequent this coaſt from <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> whether they have not always yielded their aſſiſtance with greater expedition and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, and with more diſintereſtedneſs than could be expected? And as for the idle tale which we are told of their making falſe lights on the ſhore, i can, from many years experience, aſſure it to be an untruth. Thoſe fires are occaſioned by the hunters and timber-cutters, who burn the woods to clear them of under-wood, and to procure freſh paſture for the deer. Lightning alſo often ſets fire to trees; and i have frequently, in very dry ſeaſons, ſeen ſpontaneous fires ariſe in marſhy places. But after all what buſineſs has a marinet (who knows the courſe he muſt ſteer) to follow any light-out of that courſe? And i would juſt hint to every one who paſſes along this coaſt, that on ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a light to the weſtward, it behoves him to look out for breakers if he ſtands in for that quarter.</p>
               <p>This promontory is a <hi>peninſula,</hi> though it has till lately paſt for an iſland. Anno 1769, i with

I was ſtimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this enterprize by the reports of the <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> fiſhermen, who told me unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly that they had often eſſayed to enter at <hi>Angel Fiſh Creek,</hi> and come out at <hi>Boca Herrera,</hi> the creek oppoſite <hi>Key Tabona,</hi> or the contrary, but always in vain; nor did any of them know an inſtance of its being done. I then entered at <hi>Angel Fiſh Creek,</hi> and after a great deal of time ſpent and no paſſage found. I at laſt entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the lake ſpecified in the chart, by drawing the boat over dry ground for above ſix times her own length. Out of this Jake i found my way by a very warrow paſſage at its ſouth end; but as no part of <hi>Key Largo</hi> yields any freſh water, and after we got into the above named lake, all the ground around us was mangrove ſwamp, we were unable to find any; two of my people were nearly exhauſted and ſpent by thirſt, which we could not poſſibly alleviate until we reached the watering place at <hi>Matacombe.</hi> This by way of caution, if any ſtranger might come here. And after finding abundance of freſh water on every part of the coaſt, he may not venture to be out for any purpoſe, within this <hi>peninſula</hi> for above half a day, without a ſtore of that invaluable neceſſary.</p>

place to the SW of it, but neither has a greater depth than 9 feet at low water. This iſland is only a large thicket of mangrove, without a foot of dry ſoil on it, and affords only ſome <hi>Aquatic</hi> birds and their eggs.</p>
               <p>Between <hi>Sound Point</hi> or <hi>Cape Florida,</hi> (by which laſt name i ſhall henceforth call it,) and this laſt iſland is another ſheltering place, or roadſtead, for ſmall veſſels, within a ridge or reef on which we generally ſee ſome turtle crawls, but it is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom occupied except by the timber-cutters, the <hi>peninſula</hi> affords in this place <hi>Lignum-Vitae, Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> and <hi>Mohogany,</hi> the two laſt are indeed found on every part thereof, but on none of the keys north of <hi>Saunders-Key</hi> or <hi>Las-Tetas</hi> nor on none to the ſouth of the laſt key north of <hi>young-Mata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combe,</hi> all theſe timbers are however now nearly cut off.</p>
               <p>This <hi>peninſula</hi> affords no living creature except <hi>racoons</hi> and inſects, eſpecially thoſe troubleſome ones, <hi>muſketoes</hi> and <hi>ſcorpions.</hi>

               <p>From the <hi>Cape</hi> or <hi>Sound Point,</hi> the direction of the coaſt alters to S W; and the diſtance to the ſouthern extremity of this <hi>peninſula</hi> is 10 or 11 miles.

The channel here is pretty wide; but a man muſt be kept at maſt head to diſcover heads, as ſome rocks lie in this tract; eſpecially near <hi>Key Tabona.</hi> This <hi>Key Tabona</hi> has juſt ſuch a ſmall harbour within a reef as <hi>Key Rodriguez.</hi> This key has little of
<pb n="xxxiii" facs="unknown:014440_0396_0F9261566ED63C00"/>
no high ground on it; it affords land crabs, a few doves, and other birds. One mile to the weſt of this key the ſouth point of the <hi>peninſula</hi> makes a creek ſcarce a muſket ſhot wide, admitting only of boats: This creek is by the Spaniards called <hi>Boca Herrera;</hi> the bay within abounds with <hi>Red Drum</hi> and ſome other fiſh, and a great deal of green and loggerhead turtle; lobſters likewiſe are in vaſt plenty between the <hi>cape</hi> and this creek.</p>
               <p>Within and between the above two keys lies a third called <hi>Dove-Key,</hi> it is very ſmall, gravelly and rather high, with very few buſhes on it; during rainy ſeaſons it affords good freſh water and a few doves: we alſo find purſlain growing on it. From <hi>Key Tabona</hi> due eaſt lies the ſouthern point of the great reef making a wide channel, this ſouth point is dry, the channel is 5 fathoms deep, and ſhips in diſtreſs may find ſhelter under this point; it is almoſt impoſſible to point out any lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mark as the reef lies 10 or 11 miles from the land; but my chart ſhews it plain, and a good look out for heads is the moſt eſſential pilotage here.</p>
               <p>From the ſouthweſt part of the <hi>Peninſula</hi> the courſe is S W diſtance 6 or 7 miles, paſt two more keys of no note, ſtill belonging to the <hi>Groupe</hi> of iſles called <hi>Key Largo,</hi> we then come to an iſland of ſome note called <hi>Young Matacombe,</hi> it is 4 miles long, trending S W; it has nothing remarkable on it except a well of good freſh water on its eaſt end, this however is known to few and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly little frequented; off the S W end of this key lies a ſmall drowned mangrove iſland, and a channel 10 foot deep runs in to the ſouth of it and ſhoots

up to within the great key, but there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on the key to attract much notice it is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom viſited.</p>
               <p>In coming this way from <hi>Key Tabona</hi> the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel is in general deeper than before, but the ſame rule of keeping without 12 and within 18 feet ſtill holds good; directly abreaſt of <hi>Young Matacombe,</hi> 1½ miles E from the land are a parcel of danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſunken heads called the <hi>Hen and Chickens,</hi> which require a good look out to be kept.</p>
               <p>Next is <hi>Old Matacombe,</hi> remarkable for being the moſt handy and beſt watering place on all this coaſt, on its eaſt end are 5 wells in the ſolid rock, ſaid to be cut by the ſavages, but to me they appear natural chaſms, they yield excellent water in abundance, and ſome ponds near it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe afford ſome, inſomuch that in a wet ſeaſon all the eaſt end of the key is overflown, and water enough to be had for to ſupply the neceſſity of a fleet; the key is 4 miles long, and at its weſt end are likewiſe ſome ponds and wells, but the water is of a much inferior quality. This key was one of the laſt habitations of the ſavages of the <hi>Colooſa</hi> nation: about a mile to the eaſt of the N E end of <hi>Matacombe</hi> lies a ſmall buſhy, gravelly key on the extremity of a reef, this key is called <hi>Matanca,</hi> i. e. Murder, from the cataſtrophe of a French crew ſaid to have amounted to near three hundred men, who were unfortunate enough to fall into the hands of the <hi>Colooſas,</hi> which ſavages deſtroyed them to a man on this ſpot. This <hi>Key Matanca</hi> lies SSW 2 miles from the ſmall man-grove key &amp; is the leading mark for finding the watering place on <hi>Matacombe,</hi> for come from whatever quarter you
<pb n="xxxv" facs="unknown:014440_0398_0F9261577060EEF8"/>
pleaſe, the way is to run boldly up to within piſtol ſhot of the N E part of this ſmall key, when you will find yourſelf at the chops of a channel which leads up to the watering place; it admits of 10 foot and is bounded on its N ſide by a very ſhallow reef which divides this channel from the channel to the ſouth of <hi>Young-Matacombe,</hi> the channel is ſo plain that the beſt direction is the eye; the tides are very rapid, conſequently require to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted both in coming in or going out, the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel is very narrow having only juſt room enough for a ſmall veſſel to turn to windward.</p>
               <p>From the ſouth end of the great reef of <hi>Tabona</hi> it is no longer a continued reef, but all in divided ſpots as the chart ſhews, and the channel within them is likewiſe wider and deeper, but you will find leſs ſmooth water than from <hi>Key Biſcay</hi> to <hi>Key Tabona.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the weſt end of <hi>Matacombe</hi> is another chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel which is the firſt that opens (for a veſſel of 6 foot draught) into the gulph of Mexico.</p>
               <p>To ſail into this channel you muſt borrow pretty near to the key at its weſt end, where you will have 10 foot water, then ſteer in north to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a cluſter of ſmall mangrove keys for about a league; when you are within half a mile of the bank of ſaid keys you alter your courſe to WNW and you will ſoon find yourſelf between two very ſhallow banks, and ſhoal your water to 6 foot; now you will ſee many points of banks which will oblige you frequently to loof and bear away between the W, WSW, &amp; WNW, the banks are almoſt dry, but the channel of an even depth ſhows blue; ſo that a careful eye cannot miſs it.
<pb n="xxxvi" facs="unknown:014440_0399_0F9261594E41BFF0"/>
Theſe courſes continue for 4 leagues, when you will find your channel to widen very much. Now ſteer NNW 3 miles and you will ſee <hi>Cayo Axi,</hi> or <hi>Sandy Key</hi> in the NW about 1½ leagues off; then alter your courſe to weſt, come no nearer than within a league of the key, and in five miles you will deepen your water to 9 feet, continue your courſe W till the key bears ENE and you have ſea room into the <hi>Gulph of Mexico,</hi> but the ſoundings deepen very ſlowly to the weſtward and north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; take care never to attempt this paſſage without a leading wind.</p>
               <p>N. B· <hi>Sandy Key</hi> is a low key covered with ſome buſhes and prickly-pears; there are rabbits on it, and always plenty of <hi>flamingoes, plovers,</hi> and other excellent water fowl to be had.</p>
               <p>NW four miles from this key is <hi>Punto Tancha,</hi> or <hi>Sandy Point;</hi> here was anciently a ſettlement of <hi>Colooſa</hi> ſavages. Tolerable water, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent veniſon are to be had here.</p>
               <p>From the SW end of <hi>Matacombe</hi> to the weſt end of <note n="*" place="bottom">Spaniſh for Rattle-Snake Key.</note> 
                  <hi>Cayo Vivora,</hi> the courſe is SW, and the diſtance 4 miles, the depth of water 17 or 18 feet on a ſandy bottom, give the key a birth of at leaſt 2 miles. At the SW end is a channel of 9 foot depth into the Gulph of Mexico, plainly marked on the map, for which a good and careful look-out is the beſt director.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Cayo Vivoras</hi> S W b W 10 miles brings you to a remarkable contraction of the channel between the outer reef and the keys, your depth is generally 18 foot, the bottom ſandy, and a conſiderable broad bank runs off from the iſlands,

which are the <hi>Cayos Vacas,</hi> i. e. <hi>Cow Keys.</hi> At this contraction of the channel your courſe alters to W S W, and you go through the like draught of water for 5 leagues, then the reefs are again further off, and you are come to the weſtermoſt of the <hi>Cow Keys,</hi> in lat 24°:41, where another channel of 6 or 7 foot deep goes into the <hi>Mexican Gulph.</hi> On theſe keys is tolerable water and plenty of deer.</p>
               <p>The next iſlands are called the <hi>Bahia Honda</hi> keys, extending E and W for 5 leagues, your courſe is W: and your depth of water 17 or 18 feet; at the eaſt end of the weſtermoſt key is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother channel 8 feet deep, opening the gulph of <hi>Mexico,</hi> and leads as the chart explains; but being difficult, it is ſeldom attempted. Midway before theſe iſlands 2 leagues to the ſouth is a dry ſand-bar, on which, in the ſeaſon, the ſea-fowl lay a great quantity of eggs. Five leagues W b S from this, and directly ſouth from new-found harbour, 3 leagues off is another, on which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Cayo-Hueſo,</hi> vulgarly called <hi>Key-Weſt,</hi> the courſe is W b S, and the diſtance about 6½ leagues. At a little more than 2 leagues you find a harbour called <hi>Newfound-Harbour;</hi> it is ſafe, but the bottom foul in many places. The depth of water in this courſe is from 17 to 23 feet. About half way between <hi>Newfound-Harbour</hi> and <hi>Key Weſt,</hi> are ſome heads of rocks, as laid down in the chart, but they are eaſily diſcovered in fair weather. All theſe keys abound in veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="xxxviii" facs="unknown:014440_0401_0F92615A7874A6E8"/>
and water; eſpecially the <hi>Pine Keys,</hi> on which there is likewiſe ſome honey found.</p>
               <p>At the weſt end of <hi>Cayo Hueſo,</hi> is a paſſage into the <hi>Gulph of Mexico,</hi> this key, or rather theſe keys (being made up of ſeveral) extend about SW and NE for 10 miles, having a ſhallow bank before it. The S W end lies in lat. 24°. N long. 81°:15 weſt; it has a ſhallow ledge cloſe to it on the ſouth, and the point is a low kind of ſavannah, on which one or two ſingle trees appear; near which is a well of very ordinary water. The way into the channel is to give the ſouth point a birth till you have the channel well open to the north of you, then ſteer in and keep the key cloſe on board within 15 or 20 fathoms, you will find from 24 to 16 foot water, run in till you bring the N E end of a ſhoal on your larboard hand to bear near WNW, then double the point of the iſland to the weſtward, and you may anchor in 16 or 18 foot water, but the bottom is foul and the road<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead unſafe, eſpecially in N and NW winds. Round the ſhoal to the weſtward is another chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel rather deeper, but not ſo direct; and half a mile to the north of the ſhoal is a bar having ſcarce 14 foot on it; after paſſing which you may ſteer N ½ W and you will in a run of 2½ leagues clear the eaſtern bank, gradually deepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your water, as the map ſhews. The tide here runs violently. Within the anchoring place eaſtward of the point, is a path leading to a well or pond of excellent freſh water; round which a low kind of ſtone wall is placed, and the trees are marked with many names; the ground is trodden like a ſheep crawl, occaſioned by the deer who
<pb n="xxxix" facs="unknown:014440_0402_0F92615B2E0B4EC8"/>
reſort here to drink, of which a patient man may here ſhoot 5 or 6 in a day; they are very ſmall, but of excellent flavor. Doves likewiſe abound here. This watering place is ¼ of a mile from the beech.</p>
               <p>If you are bound to ſea from this key, ſail from the SW end directly for a ſandy key, which you will ſee in the SE near 3 leagues off, and you will have generally about 23 or 24 foot depth, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row cloſe on the weſt end of this ſand ſo as you might chuck a biſcuit on ſhore, and you will find 5 fathoms, which ſuddenly deepens, and two miles carry you off of the bank into the gulph ſtream. 3 leagues weſt from this ſandy key lies another ſimilar to it, being the laſt part of the reef, the <hi>Havana</hi> bears from here nearly S ½ E, and is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 20 leagues off; but veſſels bound there will do well in ſteering higher up, if poſſible, on account of the currents. The tide ebbs &amp; flows here regularly 6 foot, and the time of full ſea at full and change of the moon is 8 o'clock, as it is every where from Key <hi>Vacas</hi> to the <hi>Dry Tortugas,</hi> the tides ſetting as the darts deſcribe. The tides from Key <hi>Vacas</hi> northeaſtward riſes not quite ſo high, and the time of full ſea is from 7 to 8 o' clock, being later as you come weſtward; the darts ſhew the ſetting of the tides: to the northward of <hi>Key Biſcay</hi> the current on ſoundings is much governed by the wind; but when the wind has little influence the ebb ſets north, and the flood ſouthward. A due attention to this will much ſhorten a paſſage over ſoundings to the reef.</p>
               <p>Next are the <hi>Cayos Mulas,</hi> to the weſtward of <hi>Cayo Hueſo,</hi> trending eaſt and weſt for 6 leagues;
<pb n="xl" facs="unknown:014440_0403_0F92615E35257030"/>
at whoſe weſt end we find the principal paſſage out of the Gulph of <hi>Florida</hi> into the Gulph of <hi>Mexico,</hi> by the Spaniards called <hi>Boca Grande,</hi> which i have never paſſed, but ſuch as it is mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the map, i have taken it from a Spaniſh manuſcript, which bore more marks of genuine accuracy than moſt of the paltry draughts uſed by that nation. It was communicated to me by a gentleman whoſe name was D<hi rend="sup">•</hi> 
                  <hi>Manuel Hidalgo,</hi> a very experienced commander, who aſſured me that the Spaniſh galloons from <hi>La Vera Cruz</hi> in order to avoid the eaſt winds keep far enough north to make the <hi>Bay of Tampe,</hi> from which they ſhape their courſe ſo as here to diſembogue out of the Gulph of <hi>Mexico</hi> into that of <hi>Florida,</hi> paſſing a little eaſt of the Key <hi>Marques.</hi> I have ſeen two of theſe ſhips on the coaſt of <hi>Weſt-Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rida,</hi> not far ſouth of <hi>Cape Blas;</hi> which circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and that of three galleons being caſt away near the bay of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> ſeem to confirm that gentleman's information. The ſounding on the outſide upon the bank are taken by myſelf.</p>
               <p>The bank of <hi>Marques</hi> extends eaſt and weſt for 6 leagues, then NW ward for near 6 more, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no reef before it.</p>
               <p>From here to the <hi>Dry Tortugas</hi> the courſe is W½S, and the diſtance 44 miles, to reckon from two miles ſouth from the middle of <hi>Key Marques;</hi> water of various depth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſouthern part of the rocks lie in lat. 24.24. but a round bank with about 6½ fathom on it lies before it in lat. 24.18°: the longitude is 82°:18 weſt from London. In Auguſt of the year 1766, i was becalmed near this place, and drifted for 3 days, not having had
<pb n="xli" facs="unknown:014440_0404_0F92615F1AC18878"/>
an obſervation for 5 days before on account of fogs. I was very uneaſy eſpecially on the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a dove on the evening of the laſt day, this kept us all night (more than common) watchful; and at the break of day next morning we ſounded in 30 fathom. We kept the lead going, and ſhoaled our water gradually to 20 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorns, when it was full day, but ſtill foggy, on which i gave orders if the water ſhoaled to 12 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom to come to an anchor (our drift was then with the current, which i afterwards found to be the tide of flood ſetting to the northward on the bank) and i left the deck; but had ſcarce ſat down in the cabin when the veſſel which drew between 8 and 9 foot water ſtruck, and as it were drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged over a coral bank, i ſtarted up and hove the lead overboard, when i found 18 foot water on ſand, and ſaw a dry bank or key cloſe too to weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the currant ſtill running with violence. We came immediately to anchor, and threw the boat out, in order to examine the place where we were, we found ourſelves ſurrounded by three very ſmall low ſand keys (full of prickly pears) on the weſt, and a reef every where elſe. About 9 o'clock the tide began to ebb, ſetting violently over the reef to SE of us; at 10 the weather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came clear, and we ſaw buſhy iſlands to the N &amp; N N W about 4½ leagues off. I had a good ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation at noon, and found the lat 24°. 25. The two following days we were employed in looking for a paſſage out, through which on the morning of the third day we warp'd out to the eaſt. It was on the day following the full moon in Auguſt when we ſtruck, we obſerved the tide
<pb n="xlii" facs="unknown:014440_0405_0F92615FB46CAB68"/>
to riſe and fall full 6 foot, and the place where we ſtruck at firſt to have between 6 and 7 feet of water on it, when the tide was out, it being 9 o'clock when it began to ebb; i thence fixed the full ſea at about 8 o'clock on the full or change or a S E b E ½ E moon. All theſe obſervations i have ſince been confirmed in by a more frequent experience. This adventure was my firſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and was the raiſing of the firſt idea in me of publiſhing this work. The calms continuing i tided it up within the reef as far as <hi>Matacombe,</hi> where we watered and proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out into the ſtream; i became very ſenſible of what a great benefit the knowledge of this reef is to all people, who by means of calms, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have a long paſſage from <hi>Cape Antonio</hi> up; eſpecially on account of refreſhing. I was then bound from the <hi>Iſle of Pines</hi> to <hi>Georgia,</hi> with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hogany on board.</p>
               <p>The ſoundings, as i have marked them, were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at ſeveral times paſſing near and round this ſhoal, they are remarkable, and for them you may rely on the draught. I obſerved the variation of the compaſs to be 5°:47′ eaſt.</p>
               <p>On the NW corner of the bank is a harbour where i have made the obſervations that are laid down in the draught, at three or four different times; but as it is only planned by the eye, never having had an opportunity to make a circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ſurvey i ſhall forbear ſaying any more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it than that the northermoſt part of the bank lies by good and repeated obſervations taken by myſelf in lat 24° 48.N.</p>
               <p>Before i proceed into the <hi>Gulph of Mexico</hi> i ſhall
<pb n="xliii" facs="unknown:014440_0406_0F92616071A79FC8"/>
ſay ſomething more concerning the reef, and give my advice to ſuch as are bound through the gulph of Florida.</p>
               <p>Many people talk about going ſouthward thro' the <hi>Gulph of Florida</hi> by keeping upon ſoundings outſide the reef, but it is a navigation ſo danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that i would wiſh every body (except in caſes of neceſſity) to avoid it. I will however, tranſcribe the remarks of Robert Biſhop on this navigation, and add a few obſervations of my own on them.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>When we were ſailed out of <hi>Port Royal Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> we kept upon ſoundings, till we came as far to the ſouthward as <hi>Tybee,</hi> and then we ſtood to the E and afterwards to the S till we were got into the lat. of 26 d N and then run down in that parallel, and made the S end of <hi>Abaco,</hi> or <hi>The hole in the wall,</hi> and N W by W diſt. 5 or 6 miles from it, we anchored in white water, of about 7 fathom, off a point where the key falls in, &amp; there we got fiſh in plenty, for which purpoſe we anchored, as alſo to delay time for 4 or 5 hours. At 2 PM we weighed, and ſtood S W for the <hi>Berry Iſlands,</hi> which we made and came upon ſoundings at 8 ditto. The courſe is S W diſtance 8 leagues; and from thoſe iſlands to <hi>Providence,</hi> the courſe is S S E diſtance 12 leagues.</p>
                  <p>When we got ſoundings, we kept our lead going, &amp; we laid by it all night, keeping in, or out, as we deepened or ſhallowed our water; but our courſe was between the W and W by N and our diſt. 15 leagues.</p>
                  <p>The breadth of ſoundings (at leaſt from the <hi>Berry</hi> to <hi>Iſaac Rock</hi>) is from 3 to 5 miles
<pb n="xliv" facs="unknown:014440_0407_0F9261613B980310"/>
from the banks, being broadeſt at the rock. Upon the bank's edge are two ſmall rocks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Berry Iſland</hi> and <hi>Iſaac Rock,</hi> which terminates the N W corner of the bank.</p>
                  <p>At a cables length off the W ſide of <hi>Iſaac Rock,</hi> you have no ſoundings: So that as you come round it, you immediately get into ocean water, and conſequently into the current of the <hi>Gulph.</hi> But if it ſhould happen that the wind be at S S E and you cannot lie S or S by E ſo as to take the current under your lee, and keep the bank on board, your beſt way will be to anchor, or keep in upon ſoundings to the northward of <hi>Iſaac Rock,</hi> till the wind comes favourable.</p>
                  <p>By this will appear the neceſſity of getting to <hi>Iſaac Rock</hi> by morning; for then you get round and keep in on the edge of the ſounding, by which you will plainly diſcern the bank, the water being clear, and the bank white, with two ſmall rocks between <hi>Iſaac Rock</hi> and the iſland of <hi>Bimina;</hi> the diſtance between being 4 or 5 leagues almoſt N and S.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Bimina</hi> there is a harbour of 9 feet water, and anchorage in the opening, with a well of water on the E point. The harbour lies in lat. 25 d. 30 m. N.</p>
                  <p>From the iſland of <hi>Bimina</hi> S. diſt. 8 or 9 leagues, is <hi>Cat Key Harbour,</hi> or the beginning of the <hi>Rocqueſes.</hi> From <hi>Bimina</hi> the ſounding is narrow, and, conſequently the current ſtrong. From hence over to the <hi>Florida</hi> ſhore, the breadth is no more than 15 or 16 leagues. From <hi>Cat Key</hi> abreaſt of the <hi>Rocqueſes,</hi> the
<pb n="xlv" facs="unknown:014440_0408_0F926161F9B099B8"/>
ſounding is pretty broad, with good anchorage, and leſs current, as you come to the S E and S E b S.</p>
                  <p>From the ſecond or <hi>Cat Key,</hi> the courſe S E by S diſt. 12 or 13 leagues, is <hi>Orange Key,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good anchorage to the S W of it 5 or 6 miles, in 20 fathoms water. When we get upon this ſlat, we think we have ſecured our paſſage through the <hi>Gulph,</hi> this way; for then you may make ſail either in the morning, or at midnight, ſteering S W diſt. 10 11 leagues, and ſo you will fall in with <hi>Key Sel Bank,</hi> which for ten leagues on the north ſide ſtretches E and W and conſequently the current ſets ſtronger as you come to the weſtward. When you come over, there is good ſoundings all along by it, and you may diſcern by the bank how far you are to the eaſtward of the <hi>Double-Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Shot:</hi> For as my draught ſhews, the number of rocks on the bank, there is anchorage by ſpots all the way in; but the ſoundings are nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row at the <hi>Double-headed Shot,</hi> the middle of which lies in lat. 23 d 57 m N and S S E is <hi>Key Sel,</hi> where there is water, diſtance 4 leagues. Here the <hi>Spaniards</hi> make ſalt.</p>
                  <p>From the <hi>Double-headed Shot</hi> to the edge of the ſoundings a little to the W of <hi>Cape Florida,</hi> is N W by N 15 leagues.</p>
                  <p>From the <hi>Double-headed Shot</hi> to the <hi>Metances,</hi> the courſe is S W by W diſt. 23 or 24 leagues, and from the <hi>Metances</hi> to the <hi>Havanna</hi> W much the ſame diſtance; off of which we cruiſed 5 or 6 weeks, and almoſt every day gave chace. The firſt that gave us a jaunt for the <hi>Gulph,</hi>
                     <pb n="xlvi" facs="unknown:014440_0409_0F9261652A30DF70"/>
was a ſhip from <hi>Jamaica</hi> bound for <hi>South Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina;</hi> We followed her in a diſmal dark night, and at one or two in the morning had like to have run her down. There was a conſtant order on board, to heave the lead every half hour, the whole cruize; and when we brought the ſhip to, we had 70 fathom water. As our pilots were no way concerned, we lay there all night, and fell off to 100 fathom in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; at day-light we could but juſt ſee the buſhes of the key off the cape from the poop, and it falling calm, we drove off ſoundings, and ſo got into the current, which carried us as far as 25 d 30 m N when the eaſterly wind ſprung up, and we went into ſoundings and out of the current; ſo hoiſted our boats out, and made them keep by the outſide of the reef. Whilſt the ſhip went upon the edge of ſoundings, we did not only know the breadth of ſounding by the diſtance the boats were from the ſhip, but they beſides ſupplyed the ſhip's company with fiſh in great plenty, and ſo for 23 leagues, 15 of which to the N E of <hi>Cape Florida,</hi> and 8 to the W S W till at laſt we arrived at a ſandy key, where the <hi>Looe</hi> was caſt away. At that key is the going into the inſide of the reef, or the channel, through which all the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels paſs, that go from the <hi>Havanna</hi> to <hi>St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine.</hi> In this channel there is 4 and 5 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom water, but in ſome particular places it is ſhallower. The channel continues as far as lat. 26 d N or as far as the reef runs. Off <hi>Cape Florida,</hi> is the broadeſt ſounding, where we met with 100 fathom, with the buſhes juſt
<pb n="xlvii" facs="unknown:014440_0410_0F926166511A0570"/>
in ſight from the poop of a 40 gun ſhip, and diſtant from the reef 6 or 7 miles. But in lat. 25 d 30 m are other rocks, where the <hi>Fowey</hi> was loſt: At this place there is ſounding two hawſers length off the reef in 30 fathom; but one mile further it is not ſo broad; ſo that i judge the <hi>Looe Key</hi> to be the beginning of the ſounding off <hi>Cape Florida,</hi> and the <hi>Fowey Rocks</hi> the ending.</p>
                  <p>In conſequence of the foregoing obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when we chaced we had no difficulty in going back. If we chanced to chace but as far as 25 d 25 m N we went immediately in upon ſounding, and up to <hi>Looe Key.</hi> Then we could be off the <hi>Havanna</hi> the next day in our ſtation; ſo that now we had not near ſo much trouble as we had at our firſt coming on our ſtation; for then between <hi>Iſaacs Rock</hi> and the two <hi>Keys</hi> of the <hi>Rocqueſes,</hi> we were always afraid of driving quite through the <hi>Gulph;</hi> but on this ſide, if we could but keep in upon ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we were ſafe.</p>
                  <p>Indeed moſt men who have been through the <hi>Gulph,</hi> when they come ſo far to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as 24 d 30 m N muſt be ſenſible that they meet with a ſtrong current, with the rippleing and boiling of the water; which current ſets between the N E and E N E and is occaſioned by the edge of ſounding that comes from <hi>Looe Key.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Florida</hi> ſhore does not go north as has been formerly imagined, till you arrive in the lat of 25 d 40 m N I could hurtily wiſh that the <hi>Old Streights of Bahama</hi> were thoroughly rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged;
<pb n="xlviii" facs="unknown:014440_0411_0F926166873C3410"/>
for by what i have ſeen and heard, it is not ſo bad a navagation as many now think it to be. I believe it to be an eaſy way to go to the <hi>Miſſiſippi,</hi> by croſſing over to the <hi>Florida</hi> ſhore, and ſo round the <hi>Tortudas Bank.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>Theſe remarks of that gentleman are very judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and indeed moſt of his performance tho' ſtrangely unconnected is generally pretty juſt, but his charts bad. I will however (after aſking his pardon) endeavour to rectify a few of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations, which ſeem rather crude or too haſtily penned down.—</p>
               <p>The S W courſe which he mentions from the <hi>Hole in the Rock,</hi> will carry you to the <hi>Berry Iſlands,</hi> as he ſays, but ſo low down as below <hi>Little Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour</hi> which is at leaſt 6 leagues too far to the S E. I would adviſe running W b S or at moſt W S W half W 13 or 14 leagues, which will bring you to <hi>Stirrup</hi>'s <hi>Key</hi> or <hi>Money Key</hi> being the N W part of the <hi>Berry Iſlands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the weſtward of <hi>Stirrup's Key</hi> is a tongue of ocean water ſhooting into the bank, acroſs which your courſe is W half N or W bN for 10 leagues ſcarce, to the little <hi>Iſaacs Rocks;</hi> which rocks i ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he means when he mentions two little rocks between <hi>Berry Iſland</hi> and <hi>Iſaacs Rocks,</hi> from theſe to great <hi>Iſaacs Rocks,</hi> the courſe is about W and the diſtance between 9 and 10 leagues.</p>
               <p>What he ſays of great <hi>Iſaacs Rocks</hi> and the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting round them is very juſt; but the diſtance from great <hi>Iſaacs Rocks</hi> to <hi>Bemini</hi> is near 7 leagues, Mr. Biſhop ſays but 4 or 5.</p>
               <p>The harbour of <hi>Bemini</hi> is well deſcribed. From <hi>Bemini</hi> to <hi>Beaks Key</hi> is S half E 7 1-2 leagues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>S W b S about 7 miles from the ſouthermoſt <hi>Riding Rock</hi> is a ſhoal on which a very rich Spaniſh galloon ſtruck in 1765, her bottom beat over, and pieces of her were found every where as far as <hi>Money Key</hi> to the eaſtward; the loſs of this veſſel was a <hi>profitable ill luck</hi> to the people of <hi>Providence,</hi> the bottom lies now about E or E b S 7 or 8 miles from the ſhoal in 17 feet water, and is yet ſuppoſed to contain ſome treaſure.</p>

His relation of going ſouthward upon ſoundings near the reef is very juſt, and the method of keeping a boat on the reef a very proper one; but this is too dangerous a navigation to be attempted by moſt people, yet if a gale ſhould come on from the eaſtward, i do not apprehend the riſk to be ſo great as might be at the firſt thought imagined, nor to be ſo much dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as by a perſon coming from the ſouthward and bound through the Gulph, who muſt needs be more uncertain of his ſhips place, than him that is bound ſouthward on ſoundings, for the nearneſs of the very rapid current of the gulph, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways enable the latter to take the proper precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for clawing off with certainty of ſucceſs.</p>

               </p>
               <p>There are five of theſe dry ſandy iſlands of which <hi>Key Loo</hi> is the middlemoſt.</p>
               <p>There are many inlets into the reef, but to attempt deſcribing them each apart, would be to throw more obſcurity on the matter, and to open a way to more danger, which has already been too much done by the abſurd author of that paltry pamphlet, called the <hi>Atlantic Pilot.</hi> I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent myſelf by telling my reader, that the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary precaution of keeping a boat on the reef, will always point out to him theſe cuts in ſuch a manner that he may ſafely enter any one of them in moderate weather, if want of water, contrary wind, or any thing elſe make it neceſſary for him to take ſhelter under the reef.

The ſoundings in, &amp;c. are as my chart directs, and i need not to any perſon (who knows that in a gale by reaſon of a reverting current, anchoring is full as ſafe under a reef as under land) to enlarge much about the uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the knowledge of the channels, much leſs to a man who is either in want of water, or who upon fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in with theſe ſhoals and thinks himſelf in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, has manly courage enough not to ſuffer his fright to overcome his reaſon: And whoever happens to be overtaken by the vehemence of gales, when too near in upon theſe reefs, may be happy in knowing that there are ſuch entrances into ſafety.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Biſhop</hi> mentions the depth within the reef at 4 or 5 fathom, which is more than double the quantity found. This is, i ſuppoſe, an error of the preſs.</p>

<pb n="lii" facs="unknown:014440_0415_0F92616976AE98A0"/>
ſoundings, they are meant at <hi>ſpring-tide, low-water;</hi> and all the ſoundings are laid down on my maps in feet, to avoid confuſion, occaſioned by mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing feet in one place, and fathoms in another. The Roman capital figures denote the time of full ſea at the reſpective places (where they are marked) on the full or change of the moon.</p>
               <p>The quantity of fiſh &amp; turtle to be caught here is really amazing, which, joined to the many wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering places, with the plenty of veniſon, and bear-meat, make this coaſt a valuable <hi>rendezvous</hi> for cruizers in time of war: ſpars may be had here at all times, either out of the pine woods, back of the keys, or among the drift on the beeches, which is no ſmall inhancement of the value of the coaſt to ſuch veſſels; becauſe they are not ſeldom in the want of them; at leaſt they are more liable to ſuch loſſes than merchantmen are.</p>
               <p>The fiſh caught here are in ſuch variety, that a bare catalogue of them would take up pages. Theſe moſt commonly caught are ſuch as ſeamen know by the following names, viz. <hi>King-fiſh, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racoota, tarpom, bonita, cavallos, amber-fiſh, pampus, ſilver-fiſh, jew fiſh, rock fiſh, groopers, porgys, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate-fiſh, French margate-fiſh, hog-fiſh, angel-fiſh, yellowtails, red, grey and black ſnappers, dog ſnappers, mutton-fiſh, grunts, murenas</hi> or <hi>muray, mullets, ſprats, mangrove ſnappers, parrot fiſh, red and black drum, bone fiſh, ſtingrays, ſharks, lobſters,</hi> and an immenſe variety of others, all excellent in their kinds, and what renders this plenty of more worth is, that we may with ſafety eat of all fiſh caught on the <hi>Florida</hi> ſhore, unleſs it ſhould be of hog-fiſh taken

on the very outer reef; for i have heard of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of one of this kind having ſickened ſome people, but of my own experience i can ſay that i have always eaten that delicate fiſh with ſafety, and even the <hi>amber-fiſh,</hi> and <hi>yellow billed ſprats.</hi> The worſt, or moſt violently deleterious fiſh in places where fiſh are poiſonous, is here always eaten with ſafety: On the contrary, on the <hi>Baha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Banks</hi> it is requiſite to be cautious what fiſh we eat before trying, which is moſt conveniently done by cutting the heart out of the fiſh as ſoon as caught, and to bite in it, when if the fiſh be bad, it will leave a very nauſeating, bitter, aſtringent taſte on the tongue; but if good, no ſuch taſte will be perceived. The method of boiling ſilver with the fiſh is not ſo certainly to be depended upon.</p>

               <p>At <hi>Cape Corientas</hi> is anchorage in 5 or 6 fathom about 2 miles to the NW by N or NNW of the cape, but you muſt be careful in going into this bay to give the cape a birth of a league at leaſt, on account of a ſhoal that runs to the SW off from the pitch of the cape; the water in the wells is indifferent, but eaſy enough to come at.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Cape Corientas</hi> to <hi>Cape St. Anthony</hi> the courſe is W a little northerly diſtant 12 or 13 leagues; round the cape under the W end of <hi>Cuba</hi> is anchorage in 5 fathom almoſt every where; to the north of the cape between it, and a mangrove point about 2½ leagues from it: and about half way between them are ſome wells of indifferent water.</p>

ſteer from Cape St. <hi>Anthonio</hi> N b W half W or NNW and after a run of about 5 leagues you will find yourſelf in 15 or 16 fathom water, the ſouth point of the <hi>Colorados</hi> then bears E b N 5 leagues off; this point of the reef i obſerved in lat 22° 56 and the Cape St. <hi>Anthonio</hi> lies in lat. 22° 36 long. 83 52.</p>
               <p>I could ſay more on this ſubject, but a ſmall matter of inſpection into my maps will ſhew that there is a vortex of current near and within theſe ſhoals: I therefore judge it recommendable to any perſon bound round this cape, to keep a N N W courſe for about 8 or 10 leagues to avoid them, and when you come as far to the northward as the lat 24°:00 N, by all means keep a good look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, for in this paſſage you will nine times in ten meet with a ſtrong current out of the <hi>Mexican Gulph</hi> ſetting eaſtward, ſometimes at the rate of 2½ knots; this current will ſet you on ſoundings on the <hi>Tortuga</hi> bank before you are aware thereof. In foggy weather theſe ſoundings may be a guide, my charts mark them properly. You do not change the colour of your water till you get well in with the ſhoal, but there is generally an eddy current as ſoon as you are on ſoundings. The ſouth part of the ſhoal whereon i ſtruck, as related page xli lies in lat. 24°:23′N, and the ſouthern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt dry iſland in lat. 24°:25. Therefore if you ſtand over to the <hi>Florida</hi> ſhore, as ſoon as you are up to the lat. 23:25, keep as much to the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as N N E, or N E b N till you get ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. And whatever terrible idea people have of that ſhore, if the wind will allow you, keep it on board, eſpecially in the autumn and winter ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="lvi" facs="unknown:014440_0419_0F92616FB2B42DC8"/>
when the N and N W winds are frequent, and the current often runs to leeward. In that ſeaſon you may take an advantage of the tides on ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, by carefully obſerving their times, &amp; this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct will tend to ſhorten your paſſage: When, however, you are got as far windward as the ſouth end of the <hi>Matecombe</hi> reef, in lat. 24°:52, long. 79°:50 W from <hi>London,</hi> endeavour to get all the eaſting you can poſſibly acquire, in order to get the <hi>Bahama</hi> ſhore on board; which i ſhall hereafter, by pointing out the ſoundings, ſhew to be by much the moſt eligible for ſafety in going north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>If you intend to beat up on the <hi>Cuba</hi> ſide, which is the ſafeſt on accouut of its bold ſhore, and perhaps the moſt expeditious in caſe of a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther current, (which runs here with the moſt amazing velocity) you had beſt not go further north than the lat. 24°:00, and on your firſt tack you will know whether the current is favorable or not, for if you make not at leaſt the <hi>Bay</hi> of <hi>Honda</hi> you may be certain there is a lee ſtream, &amp; in that caſe an attempt to beat up under <hi>Cuba</hi> will be nothing better than kicking againſt the pricks, and the <hi>Florida</hi> ſhore ought to be attempted. Thoſe unlucky perſons who tell the dreadful ſtories of being 5 or 6 weeks, and even more, in getting from <hi>Cape Antinio</hi> through the Gulph of <hi>Florida,</hi> which is but too frequently true, have met with ſuch a current, and through fear or ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the north ſhore, have lain that long ſpell wearing and tearing veſſels and rigging, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending their proviſions and water, and fatiguing their men to no purpoſe.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Coloradas</hi> are the weſt end of the reef of St. <hi>Yſabella,</hi> a ſteep dangerous ſhoal extending a length of 27 leagues from <hi>Porto Puercos,</hi> or <hi>Hog-Harbour,</hi> to the aforeſaid <hi>Coloradas,</hi> on a courſe chiefly W b S, and on the edge of the reef nearly half way between theſe two extremes, lies an iſland called <hi>Key Lavaſa,</hi> from whence you ſee the notch of the <hi>Cox Combs,</hi> nearly ESE ward 6 or 7 leagues off. At this key is anchorage.

               <p>Mr. <hi>Biſhop</hi> remarks, that keeping the <hi>Saddle Hill</hi> open with the notch of the <hi>Cox-Combs,</hi> will likewiſe ſerve as a mark for working to windward

under ſaid reef, but i never ſaw his performance till after i had been the laſt time here; thus i could not compare it on the ſpot, nor do i re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member exactly to have taken notice of this.</p>
               <p>He alſo ſays, that if you bring the <hi>Saddle-Hill</hi> on S W b W, and keep that bearing, it will lead you into the harbour of <hi>Babia Honda,</hi> where he ſays there is a little iſland in the middle of the bay with a good well on it; and S E from this iſland is the <hi>Rio Honda,</hi> a freſh river. Theſe remarks i never had an opportunity to experience, but being of importance, i have inſerted them here on his credit.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Bahia Honda</hi> lies near 6 leagues eaſt of <hi>Porto Puercos</hi> and the <hi>Havana</hi> 19 leagues to wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of <hi>Babia Honda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have given as near as i could, a repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the land from <hi>Havana</hi> to <hi>Pan de Matanca,</hi> the paps are very eaſily known, and by bringing them to bear S, or S ½ E, then running for them, it will lead you into the port of <hi>Havana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This place, by my obſervations, lies in lat. 23°: 20, and its long. i judge to be neareſt 81°: weſt from <hi>London.</hi>

               <p>I have always obſerved that a lee current does not extend eaſtward of <hi>Bahia Honda,</hi> at leaſt i have found it ſo during 5 or 6 times that i met the current ſetting weſtward; but at thoſe times and in 8 or 10 other paſſages along this coaſt have

               </p>
               <p>From this point moſt people chuſe to ſtretch over, and Mr. <hi>Biſhop</hi> adviſes the bringing of the <hi>Pan de Matanca</hi> S, or S b E, before one puts over for the gulph, and then to ſteer N N E; both are right enough; but i ſhall endeavour to point out a ſafer way.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Punta Guanos</hi> to <hi>Key Sal,</hi> the courſe is E N E ſomewhat eaſterly 23 leagues.</p>
               <p>From the ſmall key of <hi>Punta Ycaco</hi> to <hi>Key Sal,</hi> is N E b E near 13 leagues.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Key Sal</hi> to <hi>Deadmans Keys,</hi> on the <hi>Double-headed-ſhot</hi> bank, is N b W 5 leagues. And,</p>
               <p>From <hi>Deadmans Keys</hi> to the ſouth point of the <hi>Cape Reef,</hi> is N W b N 19 or 20 leagues.</p>
               <p>From the ſame <hi>Deadmans Keys</hi> to the <hi>Riding Rocks,</hi> is N E b N 23 leagues.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Riding Rocks</hi> lie E b N 19 leagues from the ſouth point of the <hi>Cape Reef.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it follows, that from <hi>Punta Ycaco</hi> to the ſouth point of the <hi>Cape Reef,</hi> the courſe is nearly N, and the diſtance 29 leagues.</p>
               <p>It is hardly poſſible that a veſſel ſhould fall ſo far leeward as the ſand bar of <hi>Key Vacos,</hi> or <hi>Key Loo,</hi> unleſs that ſupine careleſſneſs and drowſy humor too common among the greateſt part of the Engliſh ſailors, might cauſe the crew to let her run 4 or 5 points leeward of her courſe.</p>
               <p>For thoſe, however, that may meet with ſuch an accideat, i will point out the ſituation of thoſe keys.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="lx" facs="unknown:014440_0423_0F92617373CD8D08"/>Mr. <hi>Biſhop</hi> has evidently miſtaken the ſand bar of <hi>Key Vacas</hi> for <hi>Key Loo,</hi> which may eaſily be the caſe without my impeaching his judgment, for they look exactly alike: I am led to think ſo when he ſays, "from the <hi>Havana</hi> to—<hi>Looe Key,</hi> is N E b N, diſtant 32 leagues." And again, "from the <hi>Metances</hi> to <hi>Looe Key</hi> is N weſterly, diſtance 25 leagues." Whereas the true bearing is from the <hi>Havana</hi> to <hi>Key Loo</hi> N b E 21 leagues, and from <hi>Punta Guanos,</hi> or the weſt point of <hi>Matanca</hi> Bay, to the ſame key, the courſe is NNW 24 leagues. But from the <hi>Havana</hi> to the ſand bar of <hi>Key Vacas</hi> is N E northerly 32 leagues. And from <hi>Punta Guenos</hi> to the ſaid ſand bar, it is North about 24 leagues.</p>
               <p>From the foregoing Courſes and diſtances the Intelligent mariner will eaſily ſee, that <hi>Punta Ycaco</hi> is the moſt eligible place from whence to take his departure when bound through the <hi>Gulph</hi> of <hi>Florida.</hi> My advice therefore is, that if he makes the keys of <hi>Punta Ycaco</hi> early in the day, to delay time till 3 o'clock P. M. at leaſt, or rather 4, his time may be uſefully employed in fiſhing on the reef north of the point; for his labour and delay will be amply compenſated by the excellent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment and ſtore of fine fiſh it will afford him. The depth of water is from 4 to 14 fathom; but venture no nearer than 4 fathom, and beware of a ſunken rock lying about a mile weſtward from the weſternmoſt key.</p>

               <p>During my ſeveral cruizes within the <hi>Martyr</hi> reef, i have ſeen a great number of veſſels borrow ſo cloſe on the reef, as that they appeared to be within it, and ſometimes i could even ſee the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with help of a glaſs, ſuch i ſuppoſe are well acquainted, or very bold: but be the man who does this never ſo experienced, he muſt be careful to keep a ſtrict look-out; for my part i would not come nearer than juſt to raiſe the land, eſpecially as tides may have their influence fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off than we are aware of. <note n="*" place="bottom">See the end of this appendix.</note>

               <p>The <hi>Florida</hi> ſhore does not run north till you are paſt the <hi>Fowey</hi> rocks in lat. 25°:35 N; to ſay more about it would be no better than needleſs repetition, as i have already ſo amply treated of it.

too much on this falacious information; i could therefore not forbear again hinting at it in this place. Nor can we in the very inſtance under the preſent conſideration, too much admire the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive goodneſs of the All-gracious Ruler of the univerſe towards us weak mortals, by providing ſo facile a navigation for the regions of the weſt, by means of a velocious current, and by ſo diſpoſing the ſeveral ſhores of this mazy labyrinth of reefs and keys, as to cauſe this uſeful current to run in a direction N E, and at ſo great a rate as 3 or 3½ miles an hour, by which means we are enabled better to avoid the eminent dangers of this reef, when it becomes a lee ſhore, for the violence of the eaſterly gales beats the gulph water over the reef, ſo as to deſtroy the effects of the flood tides, by cauſing a conſtant reverberating current from the ſhore over the reef, inſomuch that a veſſel riding under the reef will lay with her ſtern to windward. I once came out from <hi>Matacombe,</hi> and was ſcarce clear of the reef before i was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by a gale from the eaſtward, which was very violent; it was 5 o'clock in the evening, and it being too dark to attempt a re-entrance of the reef, i was forced to heave the veſſel too, which i did under her balanced mainſail; ſhe was a heavy ſchooner of about 70 tons, and a dull ſailor: the ſucceeding night i paſſed in the deepeſt diſtreſs of mind, ſeeing the burning of the breakers in conſtant ſucceſſion on the reef till paſt 1 o'clock; the ſtorm continued till 10 next morning, when i made ſail to the northward, and at noon to my utter aſtoniſhment, i had an obſervation of the ſun's altitude, which proved me to be in lat 26°:
<pb n="lxiii" facs="unknown:014440_0426_0F92617662D9F770"/>
50′, by which i had made a difference of lat. of 118 minutes in the ſhort ſpace of 19 hours (17 of which i lay too.) I think this ſo extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry an inſtance of the rapidity of this current, and ſo evident a proof of the reaſon of the increaſed velocity thereof, that i could not omit relating it. When i treat of the <hi>Behama</hi> bank, it will however appear, that on that ſide the ſhore is not ſo ſteep, and therefore not ſo dangerous.</p>
               <p>I am an utter enemy to all theoratical ſyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic poſitions, which has cauſed in me an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable thirſt for finding in my experience, cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es for all extraordinary appearances, be they what they will. And my experimental poſition of the cauſe of the increaſe of the velocity of this current, during the gales that blow contrary to its direction, is no other than the reverber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating current, occaſioned by the ſwelling of the water within the reef, which in the memorable gale of October, Anno 1769, when the <hi>Ledbury</hi> was loſt, was no leſs than 30 feet above its ordinary level; which height will appear the more ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing when we come to conſider the ſpacious ſurface of the ſounds that were filled by it.</p>
               <p>Having thus led the careful mariner through the reefs into the open gulph, there only remains for me to give a caution againſt the <hi>Memory Rock,</hi> for which ample inſtructions are given in a hint at the very beginning of this tract. My next care will be to give ſome</p>

               <p>IF you are bound into this river keep the NW courſe till you are in lat. 29° 10 N, then run down for the river on a W courſe; if you happen to fall in to the northward of the mouth, come no nearer than 15 fathom, when you will have coarſe brown ſand; then run S, or S half W, keeping your lead going, till you come on ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſo ſoft that the lead will bring none of the mud up, unleſs it be woolded with canvaſs; if then the wind be free, run the above courſe or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more weſterly; but by all means take care you are not to the ſouthward of the laſt mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed latitude when you run down on a W courſe, for fear of falling in to the ſouth of the river: When you approach the rivers mouth, which you will by running about 4 miles on the above ſoft

               <p>If no launch come out, and the weather fine, come to an anchor, there is little or no danger, and if need the current will always carry you out again, provided you keep oppoſite the channel.</p>
               <p>In going up the river it is neceſſary to keep within about 20 feet of the land, or of the drift wood that lies along it, except when you find it lodged on points or banks, in ſuch places give it a reaſonable birth.</p>

ſtands a very large ſingle live oak tree; about 4 leagues to the NW of the cape is a middling good roadſtead, where in caſe of eaſterly winds it is ſafe riding in 4 or 5 fathom, black mud and ſhells; and about 3 leagues further north is the bar of <hi>St. Joſeph,</hi> the entrance into which harbour will be hereafter deſcribed.</p>
               <p>If you fall in ſtill more to the eaſtward, you will find the water clearer, and even in 12 or 13 fathom, it is of a dark blue like the ocean; the ſoundings begin in 28° 30, or even ſooner, and the bottom is fine ſand, mixed with coral, ſhells, and ſome ſpunges.</p>
               <p>In caſe you fall in with the coaſt of <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> you will not ſtrike ſoundings before you be in lat. 29° 15, or 29° 20 N, ſame ground as off the cape; but as you advance towards the land you will in many places meet with coarſe, muddy grey ſand, mixed with black ſpecks, and at ſome caſts the lead will bring up fragments of coral; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the lat. 29.30 N you will find 18 fathom, ſand with ſmall ſhells; and you may then juſt ſee the land of <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> to the weſtward of the inlet; which land has a woody flat appearance, with an even white beach, and a bold ſhore, ſo as to have 10 or 11 fathom water within a mile, or a mile and a half from the ſtrand; the coaſt trenches nearly W by N and E b S.</p>
               <p>But if you fall in ſo far to the eaſtward as to be right off the entrance of the bay of <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> or between that and <hi>St. Joſeph,</hi> the coaſt is not quite ſo bold, and the depth of 10 or 11 fathom is but juſt in ſight of land, the bottom is ſand and ſmall ſhells.</p>

               <p>From <hi>Cape Blas</hi> to <hi>St. Roſa</hi> bay the courſe and diſtance is about N W b W 27 leagues; from that to <hi>Penſacola</hi> bay is W half S between 16 and

               <p>For the better knowing of this coaſt, i ſhall make ſome further remarks, becauſe the coaſt's running ſo nearly E &amp; W, and being every where ſo nearly alike in its level &amp; woody appearance; the moſt ſkilful and experienced pilot may here be deceived, eſpecially as the advantage of obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which is ſo great a help on a N &amp; S coaſt, fail here totally.</p>
               <p>In coming on this coaſt, if your land-fall be off the iſland <hi>St. Roſa,</hi> your firſt ſoundings will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 80 fathom (little more or leſs) oozy ground, this depth and bottom is about 15 or 16 leagues from the land.</p>
               <p>If you fall in about 10 leagues eaſtward of <hi>St. Roſa</hi> bay, you will ſee the beech very white, and no ſand hills on it, which laſt circumſtance diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhes it from the land further weſtward; near the beech is very little growth, beſides ſhrubs, and bruſhy plants; if you ſtand pretty well in, you may, from the maſthead ſee that an extenſive <hi>Savannah</hi> (or plain) is ſituate within this ſhrubbery; which is an other mark to diſtinguiſh it from the land to the weſtward, which being an iſland, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is ſeen over it.</p>
               <p>The bar of <hi>St. Roſa</hi> only admits craft of 6 foot draught. As you come near this inlet or the eaſt end of <hi>St. Roſa</hi> iſland, it is difficult to know that it is an iſland: the woods grow cloſe to the beach,

which is likewiſe very white, and full of ſand-hills, theſe being contraſted by the dark green of the buſhes, are of as dazzling a white as ſnow: the iſland as before obſerved is a narrow ſlip of ſand-hills, with a very few trees ſcattered over it, moſtly towards the weſt end, and from maſthead ſeems about a cables length over, within appears the ſound; the wood-land on the north ſhore of it is of a middling ſtout growth, and the trees ſtand pretty cloſe to the water-ſide; having run down about two thirds of the length of this iſland, (in other words) about 12 leagues or upwards, you will ſee ſeveral of thoſe remarkable ſand-hills a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mentioned which appear at a diſtance like buildings or veſſels; approaching the bar of <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacola</hi> ſtill nearer, you will ſee a pretty high bluff point of a rediſh colour, about 3 or 3½ miles north of the iſland, on the main land, this point is called <hi>Deer-Point;</hi> when you come abreaſt of this, you will ſee the veſſels (if any there are) riding at anchor before the town of <hi>Penſacola,</hi> and a watch-houſe (nick-named a fort,) on St. <hi>Roſa Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> If a guard is kept here, which is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the caſe, you will ſee a flag hoiſted on it if your veſſel is a topſail veſſel, or a pendant, if ſhe be boomſailed, and a gun fired; which ſignal is made on account of your approach: if the weather is good, (and the attendance a little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than it was during the time of my reſidence there) a canoe or barge will come off with a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot; if none comes off, you may freely venture with a leading wind to run in by my plans.

The principal harbour here is between <hi>Cat Iſland</hi> and <hi>Ship-Iſland.</hi> The whole of the navigation in and about thoſe iſlands, through the <hi>Rigolets,</hi> and by the lakes to <hi>Manchac,</hi> is ſo plainly laid down in my map, that any wordy elucidation of ſo minute a matter, chiefly for the uſe of boats, would be prolixity in me.</p>
               <p>I will therefore finiſh this account of the coaſt of <hi>Weſt-Florida,</hi> by informing my reader that the <hi>Chandeleur</hi> or <hi>Candlemas</hi> iſlands, were formerly only two iſlands; but the hurricane of 1772 has cut them into ſo many parts, that they lie, or at leaſt did lie in near the ſame number and form as in the map is repreſented, the channels between them are deep, but barr'd at each end. Juſt within the north end of theſe iſlands, about 5 miles north of the <hi>Free-Maſons</hi> iſlands is a good road, as there is alſo between <hi>Breton</hi> iſland and the back of the <hi>Grand Gozier,</hi> a land of iſlands about 12 miles S S W from the ſouthernmoſt of the <hi>Candlemas</hi> iſlands; <hi>Breton</hi> iſland lies about 3 leagues W from <hi>Grand Gozier,</hi> and this laſt about 8 or 9 leagues north of the entrance of <hi>Miſſiſippi</hi> river. The depth of water in both theſe roads is from 20 to 24 feet, and the bottom a fine ſand.</p>
               <p>If you are bound out of the <hi>Miſſiſippi</hi> eaſtward, to go through the gulph of <hi>Florida,</hi> you ought to endeavour to make the <hi>Tortugas,</hi> in order for this ſteer E S E from the <hi>Balize,</hi> run that courſe till you come on the edge of ſoundings, between lat. 26°: and 27° N, by this means you will not be

plagued with the trade wind, in the way of which you would fall too ſoon, before you got your eaſting. I remember a veſſel bound from <hi>Penſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola</hi> to <hi>Carolina,</hi> who was drove as far to leeward as Cape <hi>Catoche,</hi> and after being a long while (i think 4 or 5 weeks) out, was obliged to return to recruit her ſtock of proviſions; this was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs occaſioned by not getting her eaſting while ſhe was out of the way of the <hi>trade.</hi> After you are on this edge of ſoundings, direct your courſe more ſouthward, you will find very regular gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the depth, ſuch as my map lays them down, you may depend on them. It frequently happens that veſſels fall too far to the weſtward, as was the caſe with one from <hi>North-Carolina</hi> ſome four or five years ago, who was either loſt or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken near the bay of St. <hi>Bernard</hi> and the people underwent numberleſs hardſhips, as well among the Spaniards as ſavages; I will for the ſake of ſuch who will at any rate avoid this danger ſet down ſome</p>

The harbour is made by a range of iſlands lying before it; the ſouthernmoſt of which is called <hi>Long-Iſland;</hi> its North end is called <hi>Grant</hi>'s point, in honor of governor <hi>Grant;</hi> the next lying about a mile North of it, is called <hi>Pollux Key;</hi> another about 1¼ mile to the N W b N of that is named <hi>Caſtor Key,</hi> in honor of two privateers, one of which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the late Capt. <hi>Braddock</hi> of <hi>Georgia:</hi> theſe two veſſels cruized in thoſe ſeas about the year 1744 or 1745; and Capt. <hi>Braddock</hi> was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally acknowledged the firſt Engliſhman who explored this bay. I have ſeen his original draught which (conſidering the circumſtances under which it was taken) was pretty exact. Next is a cluſter of keys called <hi>Mullet</hi> keys, lying between 2 and 3 miles E b N ¾ N from the north end of <hi>Caſtor</hi> key; a ſhoal runs off from each of theſe to the weſtward, to that which runs off from the <hi>Mullet</hi> keys the <hi>Spaniards</hi> give the name of <hi>Reſtingo Largo.</hi> On the <hi>Mullet</hi> keys are huts built by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who reſort here for the purpoſe of fiſhing. <hi>Grant</hi>'s point lies in lat 27, 44, and the ſouth end of the <hi>Mullet</hi> keys in lat. 27°:48 N.</p>
               <p>The coaſt, as has been already obſerved, has pretty regular ſoundings, but none very deep; to enter this bay by either of its inlets, obſerve the following directions, and they can hardly fail of carrying you ſafe.</p>
               <p>The land is low and not viſible till you are within about 8 miles from it, where you will have 6 or 6½ fathom water; the chief growth on the keys are mangrove and blackwood buſhes.</p>

               <p>To run in between <hi>Caſtor</hi> &amp; <hi>Pollux</hi> keys, keep in about 5 fathom, till you bring the north end of <hi>Pollux</hi> to bear about E b N ¼ E, then run in on that courſe till the ſouth end of <hi>Caſtor</hi> bears N E b E ½ E, and you will preſently be in about 17 feet, then ſteer about E N E directly for the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way between the two keys, and you will continue for about ¾ of a mile in 16 or 17 foot, ſhoaleſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the north bank; when you are over this you will have 3½ or 4 fathom, and by keeping a little to the northward of your laſt courſe after you have cleared the keys, you may run up the bay without ſcruple.</p>
               <p>To go in between <hi>Mullet</hi> keys and <hi>Caſtor</hi> key, which is the principal inlet, and by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> called <hi>Boca Grande,</hi> you muſt run in about 5 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms, till you bring the ſouth part of the <hi>Mullet</hi> keys to bear E ½ S, then ſail on that courſe till the north end of <hi>Caſtor</hi> key bears EbS½S, and you will find 22 or 23 foot water, ſteer that courſe till you deepen your water to 6 fathom, then run E inclining rather to the ſouth ſhore, if any; as ſoon as you have doubled <hi>Caſtor</hi> key you may anchor under it, or run up by the <hi>Mullet</hi> keys, or farther in, as the draught points out.</p>

from the ten feet bank, and in ſtanding north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward keep <hi>Deer-point</hi> open with <hi>Tartar-point;</hi> off this laſt point you will have three fathom within leſs than a cable's length of the beech, in ſtanding for St. <hi>Roſa</hi> iſland, you have no danger but what is viſible.</p>
               <p>After you have doubled <hi>Tartar-point,</hi> your courſe up to town is NNE ½ E; mid channel you have 6 fathom, and it ſhoals gradually down to 4 on each ſide; in beating up, come no nearer the weſt ſhore than to bring a large white-houſe (the higheſt in town) to bear NNE, and in ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over to the eaſt ſhore, bring it no further weſt than N ½ W; this houſe was the government houſe, and ſtands at the eaſt end of the garriſon. The beſt anchorage is to bring the above houſe to bear N ½ E, <hi>Engliſh-point</hi> NEbN, and <hi>Deer-point</hi> SEbE ½ E; at the diſtance of about a mile from the ſhore, the depth is about 4 fathom.</p>

               <p>IN going weſtward from <hi>Penſacola,</hi> come no nearer than within 5 miles from <hi>Mobile-point,</hi> and when that bears N, run till you bring the eaſt end of the <hi>Sand-key</hi> to bear N 27°: W in one with the eaſt end of <hi>Dauphin-iſland;</hi> then you will be on the bar in 13 or 14 feet, run up on ſaid courſe, and you will ſoon have 18, 24, 30, 40 feet; the bar is ſhort: continue to go ſo till you are abreaſt &amp; pretty near the <hi>Sand-Key,</hi> then haul up N ¾ E, and run in, obſerving not to borrow too nigh on the ſtarboard breakers; after you are abreaſt <hi>Mobile-point,</hi> you may gradually haul up more eaſtward; then bring the point to
<pb n="lxxxvi" facs="unknown:014440_0452_0F926193771A7200"/>
bear about SW, or SWbS 2 or 2½ miles off, and you may anchor in from 3 to 4½ fathom depth. Or you may bring the ſouth end of the ſand key juſt ſhut in with the S E end of <hi>Pelican</hi> key, and run in till you are in 15 foot, which is the bar; then ſteer W, or W ½ N, till you bring the firſt-mentioned marks on, &amp; run in as before directed: This way is deeper, but not ſo certain.</p>
               <p>There are two ſwatches thro' the eaſt breaker, and the old harbour (which according to <hi>Charlevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ix,</hi> was ruined by an earthquake) lies back of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican Iſland,</hi> and the weſt breaker; the draught ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains them. On ſhore, are the ruins of the <hi>French</hi> ſettlement, which formerly was on that iſland; what is left moſt perfect, is the remains of a guard-houſe, in the ſand-hills, and a remnant of a ſalt-work on the beach, all the reſt has been ſwallowed by the ſea; after great ſtorms, it is not uncommon to find numbers of human bones at this place. Being got into this bay, the way up to town is eaſy, but the whole of the way is ſhallow, no where exceeding 16 feet; there are no ſhallows, except between Point <hi>Claire</hi> and <hi>Roebuck</hi> river; where is an oyſter-bank, which is eaſily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided by keeping neareſt to the larboard or weſt ſhore.</p>
               <p>Having been pretty explicit about the tides on the eaſtern coaſt, it may naturally be expected that i ſhould ſay as much about the tides in the <hi>Gulph</hi> of <hi>Mexico;</hi> but little or nothing can be ſaid about ſo unſtable a matter, from <hi>Sandy-Key</hi> and <hi>Sandy-Point,</hi> or <hi>Punta Tancha,</hi> through the whole bay of <hi>Juan Ponce de Leon,</hi> up as far as <hi>Punta Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi> or <hi>Cape-Roman,</hi> it runs tide and half tide in the

ſame manner as at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> the <hi>Needles</hi> and <hi>Wight,</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> that is to ſay, three hours flood, then three hours ebb, next nine hours flood, and laſtly nine hours ebb, it does not riſe to an equal height in all places, nor does it run equally rapid in every part; in ſome narrow places, I have met it a mere fall, and in almoſt every gut among the many iſlands in this bay, i have found it as much as four ſtout men could do, to ſtem the current in a <hi>Moſes.</hi> From <hi>Cape-Roman</hi> north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and weſtward in every part of the <hi>Mexican Sea,</hi> the tide ſeems to ebb and flow once in 24 hours; but it being very much governed by the winds, this circumſtance happens very irregular; for with a S or SW and W wind, it will flow much longer than it will fall; whereas with a N or NE and E wind, it will ebb much longer than it will riſe; conſequently, it happens fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that at the time of ſprings, we find leſs water on a bar than at neap times, and <hi>vice verſa.</hi> I never could obſerve it to riſe above two feet any where at the higheſt times; yet its effect on the current of the rivers, is in dry ſummers very viſible, a great way from the ſea; and i have been told that inſtances are not wanting, when the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Miſſiſippi,</hi> was brackiſh above the town of <hi>Orleans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a conſtant current in the open <hi>Gulph,</hi> ſetting ESE, or thereabouts, at the rate of 1 or 1½ knot per hour, of which all obſerving people coming through that ſea are very ſoon ſenſible.</p>
               <p>The paſſage to the eaſtward of the <hi>Tortugas,</hi> is to be depended upon as laid down in my maps; coming through it from the northward, you will

ſee a rip appear like breakers; but in the rip is 18 or 20 fathom, and the moment a ſhip gets in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this rip, ſhe jumps out of ſoundings.</p>
               <p>A note in page lxi of the appendix, refers to the end; the note was accidentally omitted, and intended to be as follows,—</p>
               <p>Beſides this reaſon for ſtanding longer off than in, there is one ſtill greater. Every experienced mariner knows, that a veſſel will run a diſtance towards ſhore in much leſs time, than ſhe can run the ſame diſtance from it; and that the higher the land is ſhe works under, the quicker ſhe runs in, conſequently the ſlower off; hence almoſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one in beating upon a lee-ſhore, will ſtand out a longer time than in; but few even among the moſt experienced know the philoſophy of this <hi>phaenomenon,</hi> againſt which they ſo carefully guard. It is that great law of nature whereby all light bodies muſt fall on the heavier ones, i mean ATTRACTION. To explain this by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, take any veſſel, fill it almoſt with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, put a cork or chip in it, while that remains in the center, it is attracted from ever ſide alike, and therefore ſtands fixed, but no ſooner is it thrown out of the center, than it will begin to approach the ſide, and as it draws near, attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is increaſed, till at laſt the velocity of the chip becomes ſo great, as to run with a conſiderable violence againſt the veſſel, where it remains fixed; and if it is an oblong piece in ſhape of a veſſel, the ſame will happen, as when a ſhip runs aſhore ſtem on, viz. it will wind broad-ſide too. The explanation of this affair, i am indebted for to the

            <p>THE map of the country of the ſavage nations, intended to be put, facing page <hi>72,</hi> was engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by a Gentleman who reſides in the country <hi>60</hi> or <hi>70</hi> miles from <hi>New-York,</hi> to whom the plate was ſent; but when it was ſent back, it miſcarried, through the careleſneſs of the waggoner; and though the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication has been delayed ſome time on that account, it is not yet come to hand; the reader will therefore pleaſe to expect ſaid map with the ſecond volume.</p>
            <p>At the firſt planning of this publication, it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only to be a ſingle volume, not exceeding <hi>300</hi> pages, <hi>appendix</hi> and all; but at the requeſt of ſome Gentlemen, my friends, i have ſubjoined ſo many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, that it ſwelled imperceptibly to about <hi>800</hi> pages, which made it neceſſary to print it in two volumes; and as ſome unexpected accidents, eſpecially the want of a copper-plate printer, have occaſioned delays; i will therefore, to atone in ſome meaſure (for ſaid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays) to thoſe kind Gentlemen who favoured me with their ſubſcriptions for the maps, deliver them the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond volume <hi>gratis,</hi> as ſoon as it is publiſhed: It is now in the preſs.</p>
            <p>I return my moſt ſincere thanks for the liberal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement that has been afforded me; and hope my work will be deemed deſerving it.</p>
