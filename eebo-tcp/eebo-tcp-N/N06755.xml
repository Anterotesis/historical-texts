            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WE can't find one Word in the Bible, for keeping the firſt Day of the Week as a Sabbath; and, therefore we have continued in earneſt Prayer to God; begging of him, to direct us in his Ways, and eſpecially concerning this pretended Sabbath; and he has taught us by his Spirit, and the Scriptures, to labour on it publickly as on other Days, and not fear what Man can do; according to the Scriptures: And when we have ſo laboured publickly on ſaid pretended Sabbath, to pleaſe God, he hath ſhewed us plainly by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that we pleaſed him in ſo doing; and alſo, opened our Underſtanding, to underſtand the Scriptures. And when the Authority have been
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:008575_0002_102F870F4AE42988"/>
ſuffered to puniſh us, God hath been with us, and comforted us by his Holy Spirit; and ſhewed us plainly, that he that is in us, is greater than he that is in our Perſecutors; as in <hi>John</hi> iv. 4. Eſpecially in the Whippings, Impriſonments, and Spoilings of Goods, which we have endured within two Years. And this we have written, to encourage all them that God has enlightened, to ſee that the firſt Day of the Week is not his Sabbath; that they may be encouraged to take up their Croſs, in this and all other Things; that he doth enlighten them by his Spirit, and the Scriptures; and <hi>not fear them which kill the Body, and after that have no more that they can do: But fear him that is able to deſtroy both Soul and Body in Hell:</hi> According to <hi>Mat.</hi> x, 28, and <hi>Luke</hi> xii, 4. See alſo, <hi>Mat.</hi> xvi, 24, &amp;c. <hi>Then ſaid Jeſus unto his Diſciples, if any Man will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs, and follow me: For whoſoever will ſave his Life, ſhall loſe it, and whoſoever will loſe his Life for my Sake, ſhall find it: For what is a Man profited if he ſhall gain the whole World, and loſe his own Soul.</hi> Alſo, <hi>Mat.</hi> x, 36, &amp;c. <hi>A Man's Foes ſhall be thoſe of his own Houſhold. He that loveth Father or Mother more than me, is not worthy of me; and he that loveth Son or Daughter more than me, is not worthy of me: He that findeth his Life, ſhall loſe it; and he that loſeth his Life for my Sake, ſhall find it.</hi> Alſo <hi>Luke</hi> xiv, 26, <hi>If any Man come to me, and hate not his Father and Mother, and Wife and Children, and Brethren and Siſters; yea, and his own Life alſo, he cannot be my Diſciple.</hi> Thus by Chriſt's Teſtimony, we may
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:008575_0003_102F8710DD225FC0"/>
ſee, that if any Man will be held back from follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt by theſe worldly Things, tho' it be his own Life, he cannot be Chriſt's Diſciple. For tho' <hi>by Grace we are ſaved, through Faith, and that not of ourſelves, it is the Gift of God;</hi> yet by the Scriptures above quoted, and many more, if we do not take up our Croſs, we ſhall not be worthy of this Gift. Alſo, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 11, 12. <hi>For if we be dead with him, we ſhall alſo live with him; if we ſuffer, we ſhall alſo reign with him: If we deny him, he alſo will deny us.</hi> And whereas Chriſt ſays, <hi>he that taketh not his Croſs, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.</hi> By which we may alſo underſtand, that all them which do take up their Croſs, and follow after him, are worthy of him. And we can boldly teſtify, that in our taking up this Croſs, and working publickly on the firſt Day of the Week, to pleaſe God, he doth own us to be worthy of his Son Jeſus Chriſt: For he hath witneſſed it by his Holy Spirit in our Hearts: By which we alſo know, that the Scripture is true; and that the Practice of keeping this pretended Sabbath, in this Colony, is Superſtition, Idolatry, and Abomination in the Sight of God. Alſo, every Text of Scripture, that the Miniſters have ever brought, to convince us that the firſt Day of the Week is a Sabbath, has another Meaning, and not as they pretend: For by peruſing thoſe Scriptures, it appears plainly, that Chriſt, and the holy Men that ſpake them Scriptures, did not mean to teach People to keep the firſt Day of the Week; neither was it in their Mind to teach any ſuch Thing; So that there is not one Word in
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:008575_0004_102F871280F97748"/>
all the Bible, according to the true Intent and Meaning thereof, for this pretended Sabbath; and the Scripture ſays, <hi>Where no Law is, there is no Tranſgreſſion,</hi> Rom. iv, 15, and <hi>Sin is not imputed when there is no Law,</hi> Rom. v. 13; and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith of this Colony, ſays, in page 7, <hi>Believe in all Divine Worſhip: It is not enough, that this or that Act of Worſhip is not forbidden in the Word of God; if it be not commanded, and you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, you may fear you will be found guilty.</hi> Thus by their own Confeſſion of Faith, they may fear they will be found guilty for keeping their pretended Sabbath themſelves; then how much more guilty will they be found, for perſecuting others, to force them to keep it, by ſpoiling their Goods, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoning and torturing their Bodies! even them that God hath enlightened to ſee that this Sabbath is of Men, and that they ought not to conform to it; becauſe God requires them to worſhip him in Spirit and in Truth: The Scripture ſays, <hi>It is vain to worſhip God by the Commandments of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE deſire People to ſearch the Scriptures, and ſee whether theſe Things are ſo, or no: And for Encouragement, the firſt Perſon that ſhews us the Chapter and Verſe in the Bible, that ſays one Word about keeping the firſt Day of the Week for a Sabbath, ſhall have Ten Pounds Lawful Money Reward for his Trouble, paid by us, or either of us,</p>
