            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE author of the following letter, has been deſired, by ſome of the followers of Mr. Fletcher, to ſtate in writing his objections to that author's works. But to point out all the abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities attending ſuch a mixture of truth and falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, would require much time and pains. The <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of the letter therefore has, as yet, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to expoſe but one contradiction attending that author's principles. But this, if it be a real contradiction, is ſufficient, 'tis preſumed, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince perſons of ſenſe and candor, that Mr. F—r's writings contain no conſiſtent ſcheme of chriſtian doctrines.</p>
            <p>This letter when firſt written was by no means deſigned for the preſs; but only as a letter to a private friend at his own requeſt. But as ſome to whom it was firſt read, expreſſed a deſire to have it printed; and as it will in this way, be, not only better underſtood, but more extenſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly read; and as Mr. F—r's works are rapidly ſpreading among us, and many are haſtily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing his doctrines, the letter is ſubmitted to public peruſal and examination.</p>
            <p>Our ableſt divines view Mr. F—r's works as beneath their notice. And tis true, that he is a very abſurd and inconſiſtent writer. But it is equally true that his writings, being very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to corrupt human nature, are doing much miſchief in ſome parts of Long-Iſland. It is highly neceſſary therefore, that ſome body take a
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:026710_0003_0FD16315CD260720"/>
little pains to expoſe ſome of his abſurdities and inconſiſtences.</p>
            <p>Some perhaps will object that the author of the letter is a young writer, ambitious to excel, and has therefore publiſhed this, with a view merely to diſplay his abilities. That this is not the caſe, he will not undertake to prove with his pen. He means to judge others by their fruits in general; and exctpes thus to be judged himſelf.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe he has publiſhed this with no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther view than merely to diſplay his abilities; what then? Will it certainly follow that Mr. F—r has not contradicted himſelf? Or will it certainly follow that the contradiction is too trifling to be worthy of notice?</p>
            <p>In anſwer to the firſt part of the objection, that the author of the letter is a young writer it may be obſerved, that perhaps he will be found old enough to point out at leaſt one grand contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction attending Mr. F—r's principles: And perhaps more if the cauſe of religion ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it. Beſides, if from the following letter, it ſhall appear that a young writer can point out ſuch a contradiction of principles in that author's works, what may we not ſuppoſe an old writer could do?</p>
            <p>It will be further objected, perhaps, that this letter will offend the followers of Mr. F—r? If it ſhould offend any of them, let the impartial judge whether ſuch will not be offended princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally becauſe one of their errors of ſentiment is
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:026710_0004_0FD16317AB742D10"/>
made manifeſt to themſelves and others? And if this ſhould be the caſe, will they not have reaſon to doubt their own pious ſincerity, in proportion as they may be offended? Let ſuch read, John iii. 20 and 21. This letter will offend none, tis pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, but ſuch as are much under the influence of prejudice. And if we muſt not point out and expoſe errors for fear of offending ſuch, all wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and preaching to defend the truth, muſt be laid aſide.</p>

            <head>LETTER, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MY DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU doubtleſs recollect that you lately deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to ſtate to you in writing my objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Mr. Fletcher's ſcheme. I beg then you would do me, and yourſelf the kindneſs to read with impartiality, condor, care and attention the following pages:</p>
            <p>You may obſerve that this author is bitterly oppoſed to all neceſſity in moral matters. One important and eſſential principle in his ſcheme is this, That all abſolute neceſſity either of our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moral evil, or of our being the ſubjects of moral evil, is abſolutely inconſiſtent with our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either blamable or puniſhable for ſuch moral evil: Or in other words; That God cannot, conſiſtently with his perfections, blame or puniſh s for doing or being what we cannot avoid. I will cite ſome of his own aſſertions to this effect.</p>
            <p>
               <q>And that the abſolute neceſſity of all human actions is incompatible with a moral law and a day of judgement, is (ſays he) an axiom in every prejudiced mind.</q>
Vol. iii. page 201.
<q>And conſcience declares, that it is unjuſt and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:026710_0006_0FD1631A6E6643F0"/>
cruel to inflict fearful, eternal puniſhments upon beings that have only moved and acted by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity.</q>
Vol. iii. page 206.
<q>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity and a righteous judgement are abſolutely incompatible.</q>
Vol. iii. page 206.
<q>If through the ſaving grace of God which has appeared to all men, we were not again endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an awful power to chuſe life, and to be faithful, it would be as injudicious to puniſh or recompence mankind, as to whip a dead horſe for not moving, damn fire for burning, or grant water an eternal reward for its flui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</q>
Vol. iii. page 91.
<q>And when you inſinuate, that the lawgiver of the univerſe will ſend all workers of iniquity to hell, for not doing what is lawful and right to ſave their ſouls alive, or for not avoiding ſin, when he never gave them the leaſt power perſonally ſo to do, you pour almoſt as much contempt upon his perfections, as if you ſaid that he will one day raiſe all creeping inſects to judge them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſteps, and to caſt into a place of torment as many as did not move as ſwift as a race horſe.</q>
Vol. iii. page 92.
<q>But the ſcheme which I oppoſe, inſtead of leaving men without excuſe, opens their mouths and fills them with the beſt apology in the world. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity and complete impoſſibility, cauſed by another before we were born. An apology this which no candid perſon can ever object to.</q>
Vol. iii. page 172.</p>
            <p>Such you know, Sir, is his language through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a conſiderable part of the third and fourth volumes. And the principle he advances in the places, I have here cited, is a principle upon
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:026710_0007_0FD1631BD04A1AE0"/>
which he lays great ſtreſs, as every one muſt be ſenſible who has ever peruſed this author. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, almoſt or quite all his reaſoning againſt the abſolute decrees of God, the ſovereignty of grace and the like, is found upon this principle.</p>
            <p>You ſee then that one important and eſſential principle in his ſcheme is, That all abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity either of our doing moral evil, or of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſubjects of moral evil, is abſolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with our being either blamable or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable for ſuch moral evil: Or, That God cannot, conſiſtently with his perfections, blame or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us for doing or being what we cannot avoid.</p>
            <p>Now, Sir, I will endeavour to ſhow, from this author's own words, that another important and eſſential part of his ſcheme is founded upon a principle which is abſolutely inconſiſtent with the above mentioned principle; and directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory to it. The principle upon which this part of his ſcheme is founded is the following one: That abſolute neceſſity of our doing moral evil, or of our being the ſubjects of moral evil, is perfectly <hi>conſiſtent</hi> with our being both blamable and puniſhable for ſuch moral evil: Or in other words; That God <hi>could,</hi> conſiſtently with his perfections blame and puniſh us for doing ſuch moral evil as we could not avoid. And if I fully and clearly ſhow that one part of Mr F—r's ſcheme is founded upon this laſt mentioned prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, I hope you will have candor enough to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that he has abſolutely contradicted himſelf, and that one part of his ſcheme is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely inconſiſtent with the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:026710_0008_0FD1631D8818B160"/>In the firſt place then, he holds that the fall of Adam brought mankind into a ſtate, in which they could, without a Saviour, have done nothing but moral evil. They muſt neceſſarily have gone on in nothing but ſin and wickedneſs. For he undertakes to vindicate what Mr. Weſley aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted (viz.) The total fall of man, and that by nature man's will is only free to evil. See vol. i. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 16 and 21. And Mr F—r expreſſly ſays, that he agrees with Mr. Hill in this;
<q>That the will of man, conſidered as fallen in Adam, and unaſſiſted by the grace of God, is <hi>only free to evil</hi>—free to live in the element of ſin, as a ſea fiſh is only free to live in ſalt water.</q>
Vol. ii. page 210. And in another place.
<q>without him (that is Chriſt) we have (ſays he) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but helpleſſneſs; we can do nothing but ſin.</q>
Vol. ii. page 200. Again.
<q>The lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of a penitent ſinner, is (ſays he) Lord, I pray and hear, I faſt and receive, I give alms, and keep the Sabbath, but after all I am an umprofitable ſervant. I muſt work out my own ſalvation with fear and trembling, and yet without thee I can do nothing. I cannot change my heart. I cannot root up from my breaſt the deſire of praiſe, the thirſt of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and the hankering after gold, vanity, beauty, or ſenſual gratifications which I conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually feel. Without thee I cannot force my ſtubborn heart to repent, believe and love; to be meek and lowly, calm and devout. Lord deliver me from this body of death; Lord ſave or I periſh.</q>
Vol. iii. page 52. And in another place the author has theſe words.
<q>I proteſ in oppoſition to Phariſaic pride, that we have
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:026710_0009_0FD1631ECC9C2640"/>
no power to do good works pleaſant and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, without the grace of God preventing us, that we may have a good will, and working with us when we have that good will.</q>
Vol. iv. page 135. Once more.
<q>From what has been obſerved it follows (ſays he) that before any one can believe in the goſpel ſenſe of the word, he muſt be convinced of ſin by the ſpirit of God He muſt feel himſelf a <hi>guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, loſt,</hi> and <hi>helpleſs</hi> ſinner, unable to recover the favour and image of God by his own ſtrength and righteouſneſs.</q>
Vol. iii. page 44.</p>
            <p>Many more paſſages of the ſame import I could eaſily cite from this author: But theſe I truſt are ſufficient to ſhow he holds that the fall of Adam brought mankind into a ſtate in which they could, without a Saviour, have done nothing but moral evil: That they muſt neceſſarily and unavoidably have gone on in ſin and wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, this author holds that mankind would have been blamable and puniſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for their neceſſary and unavoidable ſin and wickedneſs, had a Saviour never been provided, this appears from his expreſſions which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready cited: Such as theſe;
<q>The will of man conſiderered as fallen in Adam, and unaſſiſted by the grace of God, is only free to evil—free to live in the element of ſin, as a ſea-fiſh is only free to live in ſalt water.</q>
               <q>Without him (that is Chriſt) we have nothing but helpleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; we have nothing but ſin,</q>
&amp;c. By <hi>evil,</hi> and by <hi>ſin</hi> and the like here, we are undoubtedly to underſtand that for which mankind are blama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and puniſhable; otherwiſe it cannot be <hi>moral evil</hi>: It cannot be <hi>ſin.</hi> If then without Chriſt
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:026710_0010_0FD163204DC94FE8"/>
mankind have nothing but <hi>helpleſſneſs</hi>; nothing but <hi>ſin,</hi> and their wills be free only to evil and the like, it follows that without a Saviour mankind would <hi>neceſſarily</hi> and <hi>unavoidably</hi> have been both blamable and puniſhable. They would have been, according to what Mr. F—r holds, under an <hi>abſolute neceſſity</hi> of going on in ſin, ſo as to have been guilty, blamable, and puniſhable. And he evidently grants all this in ſaying that a perſon before he believes in the goſpel,
<q>Muſt feel himſelf a <hi>guilty, loſt,</hi> and <hi>helpleſs</hi> ſinner,</q>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>But we need not reſt the matter here: For in other places he is very full and expreſs to the purpoſe. He holds that all mankind are, by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and without Chriſt, under the firſt covenant made with Adam. And he holds that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for any mere man ſince the fall to keep this covenant. At the ſame time he holds that all mankind, without Chriſt; are under the curſe, children of wrath, and condemned for not keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.
<q>This firſt covenant (ſays he) we have all broken in our firſt parents; for in Adam all died—By one man ſin entered into the world, and death by ſin, and ſo death paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinned.; Rom. v. 12. We are then all born or conceived in ſin; Pſ. li. 5. And conſequently we are by nature chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath; Eph. ii. 3.

Gal. iii 10. Vol. iii. page 40.</p>
            <p>Is this then the caſe? Have we all broken the firſt covenant in our firſt parents! Have we all ſinned in this way? And are we by nature chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath? And does this root of original ſin produce in every man many actual iniquities, ſo that we faſten the <hi>curſe upon our own ſouls?</hi> And he under the dreadful curſe which is already denounced againſt every tranſgreſſor of the law? Have we all then broken the firſt covenant, and for breaking it are we thus, children of wrath and under the dreadful curſe and the like? Would not all the poſterity of Adam then, have been blamable and puniſhable for their <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>unavoidable</hi> ſin and wickedneſs, had a Saviour never been provided? If Mr. F—r was now here, how would he avoid this conſequence? Does it not inevitably follow from his own premiſes? Surely he would not pretend that <hi>Chriſt has,</hi> by his coming, brought us under the firſt covenant, and made us thus guilty, blamable and puniſhable for breaking it? If he ſhould pretend this, he would contradict himſelf in another particular: For he holds that Chriſt came to free us from the firſt covenant, and from the guilt, blame, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation which we have incurred by breaking it. See vol. iv. page 162. If then Chriſt had never come, all the poſterity of Adam would have been under an <hi>abſolute neceſſity</hi> of being <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:026710_0012_0FD16323D0B11A10"/>
guilty, blamable, puniſhable</hi>; and of being <hi>condemned</hi> for ever.</p>
            <p>Equally full and expreſs to the purpoſe he is in another place.
<q>Under the firſt covenant, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, unſinning, univerſal obedience in our own perſons is (ſays he) required; and ſuch obedience we, in our fallen ſtate, <hi>can never perform.</hi>
               </q>
Vol. iii. page 43. But ſurely God does not require more of us than he can juſtly blame and puniſh us for not doing. It would be blaſphemy to ſuppoſe that he does: For it would be nothing leſs than ſuppoſing him to require more than he ought to require or could juſtly require. It follows then, that had a Saviour never been provided, God could juſtly, and in fact would have blamed and puniſhed mankind for their <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi> and <hi>unavoidable</hi> guilt, and wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>Once more,
<q>The ſecond covenant or the goſpel is (he tells in another place) a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of free grace and mercy to <hi>poor, loſt, helpleſs ſinners,</hi> who ſeeing and feeling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>condemned</hi> by the law of innocence; and <hi>utterly unable</hi> to <hi>obtain juſtification</hi> upon the terms of the <hi>firſt covenant,</hi> come to Jeſus Chriſt,</q>
&amp;c. Vol. iii. page 42. Here then I aſk what would theſe have done if no Saviour had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided? Muſt they not <hi>neceſſarily</hi> and <hi>unavoidably</hi> have been condemned by the law of innocence? And muſt not this condemnation have <hi>neceſſarily</hi> and <hi>unavoidably</hi> come upon all the fallen race of Adam?</p>
            <p>Again:
<q>Total death, or a full departure of the Holy Spirit. This (ſays Mr. F—r) paſſed upon Adam <hi>and all mankind in him,</hi> when he loſt God's moral image; fell into ſelfiſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:026710_0013_0FD16324CD3C61C8"/>
and was buried in ſin, guilt, ſhame and horror.</q>
Vol. i. page 259. According to this author, therefore, ſpiritual death paſſed upon all mankind in Adam when he loſt God's moral im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. And thus judgement came upon all men to condemnation; ſo that even infants muſt be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Chriſt or be damned. We therefore find him ſpeaking of the juſtification which paſſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on infants, thus;
<q>That which paſſes upon all infants univerſally, and is thus deſcribed by St. Paul; as by the offence of one judgement came upon <hi>all</hi> men to condemnation; even ſo by the righteouſneſs of one, the free gift came upon all men, unto juſtification from original ſin.</q>
&amp;c. Vol. i. page 263. And in another place, ſpeaking reſpecting the four degrees of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he has theſe words reſpecting that which paſſes upon us in our infancy.
<q>All theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of juſtification are equally merited by Chriſt. We do nothing in order to the firſt, becauſe it finds us in a ſtate of total death.</q>
Vol. i. page 264.</p>
            <p>But infants could not ſtand in need of this juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifitation by Chriſt if they were not <hi>guilty, bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable</hi> and <hi>puniſhable.</hi> It follows then that if Chriſt had never come and merited theſe degrees of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, the very infants muſt have been blama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, puniſhable and condemned. But could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants have prevented the offence of their firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Adam? It will not be pretended It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows then that, if a Saviour had never been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, all the poſterity of Adam, who might have died in their very <hi>infancy</hi> would have been under an <hi>abſolute neceſſity</hi> of being, <hi>guilty, bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable</hi> and <hi>puniſhable.</hi> Nay, all ſuch muſt accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:026710_0014_0FD163264D03A658"/>
to Mr. F—r, have neceſſarily been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned forever. This is going a great ſtretch indeed. This author ought to bluſh at mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning even the name of "Rigid calviniſts." For I truſt there are few who will equal <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidneſs with regard to this matter.</p>
            <p>Does it not appear then that all the poſterity of Adam would, according to Mr. F—r, have been <hi>blamable</hi> and <hi>puniſhable</hi> for their <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>unavoidable</hi> guilt, and wickedneſs? I could eaſily produce many more of his aſſertions of the ſame import. But theſe I truſt are amply ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſhow that, according to this author, God could juſtly have blamed and puniſhed mankind for ſuch ſin, guilt and wickedneſs as they could not poſſibly have avoided, in caſe a Saviour had never been provided. All the poſterity of Adam would have been under an abſolute neceſſity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guilty, and conſequently of being condemned.</p>
            <p>But how does all this agree with the firſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned principle of his (viz.) that
<q>Abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and a righteous judgement are abſolute, incompatible,</q>
and the like: Or which I take to be the ſame thing, that abſolute neceſſity either of our doing moral evil, or being the ſubjects of moral evil, is abſolutely inconſiſtent with our being either blamable or puniſhable for ſuch moral evil. If I can underſtand language here is an expreſs and manifeſt contradiction in theſe two principles belonging to Mr. F—r's ſcheme. And, Sir, how does he help himſelf out of this dilemma? How does he free his ſcheme from this entanglement? Will you ſay he holds that God has provided a <hi>Saviour,</hi> and by him freed all the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity of Adam from this abſolute neceſſity of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:026710_0015_0FD163282AC80AA8"/>
of being guilty, blamable and puniſhable, and of being condemned? I grant it. He does hold to this. We therefore find him expreſſing himſelf in the following manner:</p>
            <p>
               <q>Every anti Calviniſt may, and I for one do believe, that in every man born into the world, and conſidered according to the firſt covenant, <hi>original</hi> corruption, (nor Adam's tranſgreſſion) <hi>deſerves God's wrath and damnation</hi> at the hands of an holy and righteous God, without dreaming that any man ſhall ever be damned for it: See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that according to God's mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs diſplayed in the ſecond covenant. Chriſt the ſecond Adam, is come to taſte death for every man and to be a Saviour of all men; ſo that for his ſake the free gift is come upon all men unto juſtification of life.</q>
Vol. ii. page 245.</p>
            <p>It ſeems then that <hi>original corruption</hi> in every man born into the world, and conſidered accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the firſt covenant, <hi>deſerves,</hi> (according to this author's own words) God's wrath and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation at the hands of an holy and righteous God. But is it poſſible for Adam's poſterity to <hi>avoid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal corruption?</hi> He does not pretend it. Why then may not the poſterity of Adam be, not only blamable and puniſhable, but damned for what they could not poſſibly, avoid? Becauſe,
<q>Chriſt the ſecond Adam (ſays Mr. F—r) is come to taſte death for every man, and to be a Saviour of all men; ſo that for his ſake the free gift is come upon all men unto juſtification of life</q>
This is his ſolution of the difficulty. Let us then pay particular attention to it. Let us carefully
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:026710_0016_0FD163294D93BD10"/>
examine this anſwer and ſee whether it is really helping the matter.</p>
            <p>Here then let it be obſerved, that Mr. F—r holds that the gift of a Saviour was a <hi>free gift</hi> as in the words juſt cited from him. And you, Sir, know very well I truſt, that he holds to the ſame throughout his writings. He holds that the gift of a Saviour was a <hi>free gift</hi> and <hi>wholly of free grace.</hi> He holds that the capacity which Chriſt has given all mankind to repent and chuſe life, and that the power which Chriſt has given all mankind to believe and repent; and that the day of ſalvation, with a talent of living light, and rectified free agency and the like, are all of <hi>free grace.</hi> I could produce a great variety of his own aſſertions to prove what I here aſſert. But it is needleſs for no one, who has ever peruſed this author, will, I preſume, pretend to deny that he holds all mankind have theſe favours of <hi>free grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If then the gift of a Saviour be a <hi>free gift</hi> and <hi>wholly of free grace,</hi> it follows that God was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no <hi>obligations</hi> to give us Chriſt; nor any of the bleſſings which flow to us through him. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently he might juſtly have with-held the gift of a Saviour, and all theſe bleſſings from mankind, and left them in their fallen condition. And then what would have been the condition of mankind? All the poſterity of Adam would have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>an abſolute neceſſity</hi> of being totally corrupt, and of going on in ſin and wickedneſs. And they would, according to what Mr. F—r tells us, have deſerved God's wrath and damnation even for their <hi>original corruption.</hi> And ſurely they
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:026710_0017_0FD1632ACD8DBA00"/>
would have deſerved as much as this for their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual tranſgreſſions of the law of innocence.</p>
            <p>Does this author then help the matter in this way? No perſon of ſenſe and candor will ſuppoſe it: For according to his own principles, God might juſtly have <hi>with-held</hi> the gift of a Saviour and all free grace. And if ſo, it follows that every man born into the <hi>world</hi> would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved God's wrath and damnation even for that <hi>original corruption</hi> which they <hi>could not poſſibly have avoided; but muſt neceſſarily</hi> have had. And beſides their original corruption they would have had many actual iniquities. And moſt certainly theſe would have deſerved as much as their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal corruption.</p>
            <p>But how does theſe things harmonize with this author's favorite principle, that,
<q>Abſolute neceſſity and a righteous judgment are abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incompatible?</q>
And how do they harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize with the following aſſertion of his:
<q>If, through the ſaving grace of God which has appeared to all men, we were not again endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an awful power to chuſe life, and to be faithful, it would be as inſidious to puniſh or recompenſe mankind, as to whip a dead horſe for not moving, damn fire for burning, or grant water an eternal reward for its fluidity.</q>
Let candor and common ſenſe judge whether here be not a moſt awful jaring of principles. Does not Mr. F—r hold to two principles which muſt be at eternal war with each other?</p>
            <p>
               <q>We oppoſe (ſays he) the doctrine of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity, or the Calvinian muſt as being inſeparable from Manicheiſm; and we aſſert that there is no <hi>needs muſt</hi> in the eternal
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:026710_0018_0FD1632C4CEF2070"/>
death of any man; becauſe Chriſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts a degree of temporary ſalvation to all, with power to obey, and a promiſe to beſtow eternal ſalvation upon all that will obey.</q>
Vol. iv. page 88.</p>
            <p>From what this author here ſays it ſeems that the <hi>reaſon</hi> why there is no
<q>
                  <hi>Needs muſt</hi> in the eternal death of any man,</q>
is the <hi>coming of Chriſt</hi> and imparting a degree of temporary ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to all with power to obey and a promiſe to beſtow eternal ſalvation upon all that will obey. This, as well as what he ſays otherwhere, implies that if Chriſt had never come, there <hi>would</hi> have been a "<hi>Needs muſt</hi>" in the eternal death of ſome. It implies that there <hi>would</hi> have been a "<hi>Needs muſt</hi>" in the eternal death of all Adam's poſterity. But as the gift of Chriſt was, as Mr. F—r allows, a <hi>free gift</hi> and of <hi>free grace,</hi> God was under no <hi>obligations</hi> to give us Chriſt, or to provide any Saviour for mankind. Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently he might <hi>juſtly have with-held</hi> the gift of a Saviour, and left mankind with a <hi>needs muſt</hi> in the eternal death of every one of Adam's poſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; and of all mankind after the ſail. Does not this author then oppoſe <hi>himſelf</hi> in oppoſing the doctrine of Abſolute neceſſity?
<q>We muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the miſtakes of rigid Calviniſts, (ſays he) or give up the doctrines of juſtice.</q>
It appears to me as though ſome of the followers of Mr. F—r muſt renounce ſome of his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, or give up the doctrine of <hi>perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſhort; according to <hi>one part</hi> of this author's ſcheme, the great neceſſity of a Saviour to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, ariſes from their being under an abſolute neceſſity of ſinning, of being guilty, blamable,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:026710_0019_0FD1632E064DEFF8"/>
periſhable and condemned forever without one. So that not only the neceſſity, but even the grace of the goſpel to Adam's poſterity, is founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this <hi>very ſuppoſition</hi> that God might juſtly have blamed and puniſhed his creatures, for doing that which they would have been under an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity of doing; and for being what they would have been under an abſolute neceſſity of being. At the ſame time this writer has founded <hi>another important part</hi> of his ſcheme upon the <hi>ſuppoſition</hi> or <hi>principle,</hi> That God cannot, and never could in any caſe, conſiſtently with his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, blame or puniſh his creatures for doing or being what they could not avoid.</p>
            <p>Does then this author help the matter in the leaſt by ſaying, that God has freely given to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind a Saviour, to free them from that abſolute neceſſity of ſinning, and of periſhing <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

that, in this way, he has, if poſſible, entangled it the more.</p>
            <p>And indeed he himſelf appears to have been in ſome meaſure ſenſible of the impoſſibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling his jaring principles in this way. We therefore find him quitting this ground, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recourſe to another expedient. But let us follow him.</p>
            <p>
               <q>And we aſſert (ſays he in Vol. iv. page 38) that if God had not graciouſly deſigned to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place all mankind in a ſtate of initial ſalvation from ſin and hell, according to the various diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of his redeeming grace, he would have puniſhed Adam's ſin by a perſonal damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Nor would he have ſuffered him to propagate his fallen race, unleſs the ſecond Adam had extended the bleſſings of redemption ſo far as to ſave from eternal miſery all who die in their infancy; and to put all who live long enough to act as moral agents, in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of avoiding hell by working out their own eternal ſalvation in the day of their temporary ſalvation; a day this, which inconſiſtent Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts call the day of grace.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here is ſomething extraordinary indeed for one who has boaſted of his talents at reaſoning as Mr. F—r. Here we ſee him, ſo far from ſtanding his ground, that he is evidently giving way to this grand difficulty attendending his ſcheme. He tells us that if a Saviour had not been provided, God would not have ſuffered Adam to propagate his fallen race 'Tis as much as if he had ſaid; God <hi>could</hi> conſiſtently with his perfections, have ſuffered Adam to propagate his race in ſuch a ſtate that they might have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:026710_0021_0FD16330D39A20A0"/>
an abſolute neceſſity of being ſinful, guilty, blamable and juſtly puniſhable, had a Saviour ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been provided: But I do not believe he <hi>would</hi> have ſuffered it. This is granting that God could juſtly have blamed and puniſhed Adam's poſterity for doing that which they could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly have avoided; and for being ſuch creatures as they would have been under an abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of being. But how does this agree with the following aſſertion of his:
<q>If, through the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace of God which has appeared to all men, we were not again endued with an aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful power to chuſe life, and to be faithful, it would be as injudicious to puniſh or recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe mankind, as to whip a dead horſe for not moving, damn fire for burning, grant water an eternal reward for its fluidity.</q>
In ſhort, how does this agree with a principle upon which he has founded an important part of his ſcheme, (viz.) that "Abſolute neceſſity and a righteous judgment are abſolutely incompatible?"</p>
            <p>But perhaps, Sir, you will ſay that Mr. F—r's meaning here was not that God <hi>could,</hi> but that he <hi>could not,</hi> conſiſtently with his perfections, have ſuffered Adam thus to propagate his fallen race without providing a Saviour? Then it comes to this, that God, as ſoon as he ſuffered Adam to propagate his fallen race, was under <hi>obligations</hi> to provide a Saviour for all his poſterity. But if ſo, how was the gift of a Saviour to mankind a purely free and gracious gift? It certainly was not, according to this, wholly of a free grace to Adams poſterity</p>
            <p>But as Mr. F—r holds that the gift of a Saviour was a free gift and a purely gracious gift
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:026710_0022_0FD163324C866FA8"/>
to all mankind; it follows that God might, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently with his juſtice and all his other attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, have ſuffered Adam to propagate his fallen race, without ever providing any Saviour for them. And then all the poſterity of Adam would have been left under the firſt covenant: Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which
<q>An abſolute, unſinning, univerſal obedience in our own perſons is required; and ſuch obedience, we in our fallen ſtate, (ſays this author) can never perform.</q>
Suppoſe then God had never provided a Saviour, what would have been our condition? We ſhould, if what he <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> be true, have been required by the Deity to perform that in our own perſons which we never could have performed: Nay, all the poſterity of Adam would have deſerved God's wrath and damnation even for their original corruption And this they could not poſſ<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">

               </gap> have avoided, ſince it would have been brought upon them by their firſt parent Adam. Would not all the poſterity of Adam then, have been upon Mr F—r's principles, juſtly blamable, puniſhable and damnable for that which they could not poſſibly have avoided? Let reaſon, candor and common ſenſe judge. I once more then aſk with what appearance of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency or propriety he could aſſert thus.
<q>If through the ſaving grace of God which has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to all men, we were not <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

are abſolutely incompatable?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Thus, (ſays this writer, Vol. ii. page 245) by looking at our divine compaſs, the word of God, we <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> through the ſtraits of error, keeping at an equal diſtance from the rocks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which Calviniſts run on the right hand, and Pelagians on the left.</q>
From Mr. F—r's ſteerage through the ſtraits of error, one would ſuppoſe he looked at his divine compaſs blindfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: For he has made a very crooked path; and is in my humble opinion, taken up by a rock at laſt. And over this rock, I preſume, he will never run. Sir, do you not think, that this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ought firſt to have caſt the beam out of his own eye, before he had undertaken to pull the mote out of other peoples eyes? That is; ought he not to have reconciled Mr. F—r with Mr. F—r, before he had undertaken to reconcile the Calviniſts and Arminians by endeavoring to perſuade them to embrace his plan.</p>
            <p>What has this author ſaid to extricate himſelf from this dilemma? I can find nothing. From his having recourſe firſt to one ſolution of the difficulty and then to another, 'tis evident he felt his ſcheme in diſtreſs. He did not fall into this grand inconſiſtency by mere inattention. He was neceſſarily and unavoidably driven to it, in caſe he held the free grace of the goſpel and his favorite principle, that
<q>Abſolute neceſſity and a righteous judgment are abſolutely incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</q>
For if, in ſupporting this principle, he had been conſiſtent with himſelf throughout his writings, he muſt have ſaid, at all times, that God could never, if a Saviour had not been
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:026710_0024_0FD163354E0C6B98"/>
provided, have required more of the poſterity of Adam, than they could have done. And if ſo; they might have obtained righteouſneſs by the law: For they could have done what they could. And, upon this principle, God could have required no more. And
<q>If there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteouſneſs. (ſays the Apoſtle) ſhould have been by the law.</q>
Gal. iii 21. And,
<q>If righteouſneſs come by the law, then Chriſt is dead in vain.</q>
Gal. ii. 21. Thus to all Adam's poſterity Chriſt would have been dead in vain. This conſequence would have been mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to the moſt <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, if this author had been conſiſtent with himſelf with regard to his favorite principle: Nay more; he muſt have expreſſly contradicted his firſt goſpel axiom that
<q>All our ſalvation is of God in Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of grace.</q>
Upon this principle, our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation would not have been in Chriſt; and at the ſame time of grace: For all the poſterity of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam could have diſcharged the whole of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty without Chriſt. Conſequently, they could have obtained ſalvation without Chriſt.</p>
            <p>If, on the other hand, this author had univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally granted moral neceſſity to be conſiſtant with blame and puniſhment, praiſe and reward, then he would had little or no room left to object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the abſolute decrees of God, the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of grace and the like. His prejudices therefore againſt the truth led him to contradict himſelf; and adopt two principles, both of which are eſſential to his ſcheme, and yet at eternal war with each other. This then is your much boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:026710_0025_0FD16336EDA07350"/>
of Mr. F—r with all his triumphing and parade of learning.</p>
            <p>I have not attempted to point out but <hi>one</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction in this author's works. And if any perſon will ſhow me that here is not a contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; then I will ſhow him a number of places in which he his in fact contradicted both himſelf and the ſcriptures. But I ſuppoſe it would not trouble in the leaſt, thoſe who agree with Mr. F—r, if I were to point out a thouſand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions in his works. For
<q>Oppoſite doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drines are (ſays he), as eſſential to the fulneſs of Chriſt's goſpel, as the two eyes, noſtrails, and cheeks, which compoſe our faces, are eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to the completeneſs of human beauty.</q>
See vol. iii. page 241. No wonder then that this writer holds to oppoſite doctrines in ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the goſpel. Indeed he is perfectly right if this be the caſe: If there be oppoſite doctrines in the goſpel he muſt neceſſarily hold to oppoſite doctrines, if he mean to ſupport the goſpel. But Sir, what ſort of a goſpel is Mr. F—. endeavoring to ſupport? He calls it <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. But ſurely he cannot mean the goſpel of Chriſt <hi>Jeſus</hi> the <hi>righteous,</hi> the eternal Son of God, who ſpake as never man ſpake? No; he muſt have found ſome <hi>new Chriſt</hi> whoſe goſpel with oppoſite doctrines he is laboring to ſupport. And whoſe new goſpel can this be? By looking at the front-page of the firſt volume, we find he has given his works the following title:
<q>A Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Rev. Mr. Weſtey's Laſt Minutes.</q>
We ſee then whoſe goſpel Mr. F—r is labouring to ſupport. This muſt undoubtedly be the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to whoſe fulneſs oppoſite doctrines are ſo very
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:026710_0026_0FD163384CB38E70"/>

            <p>There are two general kinds of neceſſity a<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> inability. One is called <hi>natural.</hi> It has refere<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> to nature as the word is uſed in oppoſition to th<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> will. If a perſon be unable to do an action, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> be under a neceſſity of not doing it, for want <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> bodily powers, underſtanding or ſome natural fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>culty, he is under a natural neceſſity of not doing it. His inability to do this action is of the n<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ral kind. And we readily grant that ſuch an <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ability and ſuch a neceſſity are abſolutely incon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſiſtent with commands and prohibitions, prai<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> and blame, rewards and puniſhments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:026710_0027_0FD1633A919CD5B8"/>The other kind of neceſſity and inability is called <hi>moral</hi>; becauſe it has reference to the heart or will, which is the moral faculty. To illuſtrate this, let us ſuppoſe a perſon ſhould be commanded to do an action which he could not do; not for want of bodily powers, underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or any natural faculty, but wholly for want of a <hi>will</hi> or heart to do it. This perſon would be under a moral neceſſity of not doing this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. His inability to do it would be wholly of the moral kind. Thus,
<q>They that are in the fleſh (that is, in an unregenerate ſtate) cannot pleaſe God.</q>
Rom. viii. 8. But why? Is it for want of bodily powers, or any natural facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? No; but only for want of a will to pleaſe him. Their inability, therefore, to pleaſe God is wholly of the <hi>moral</hi> kind. And if God ſhould give theſe perſons a will to love him, ſo as to pleaſe him, and ſhould maintain this will in them, they would be under a <hi>moral neceſſity</hi> of loving and pleaſing God.</p>
            <p>This <hi>moral</hi> kind of neceſſity and inability may be as abſolute as the <hi>natural.</hi> And in many reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects it reſembles the <hi>natural</hi> kind. But it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry different in its nature. For the moſt <hi>abſolute moral</hi> neceſſity and inability are perfectly conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with commands and prohibitions, praiſe and blame, rewards and puniſhments: Whereas, <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> neceſſity and inability are abſolutely incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with theſe things.</p>
            <p>That abſolute <hi>moral</hi> neceſſity and inability are perfectly conſiſtent with praiſe and reward, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the ſtate of the Deity: For the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture expreſſly declares that God cannot lie; and that the judge of all the earth cannot but do right.
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:026710_0028_0FD1633A97501808"/>
His will is perfectly holy. And he cannot have any other but a holy will. Conſequently, he is under an abſolute <hi>moral</hi> neceſſity of being holy. But no one, I preſume, will pretend to ſay that God is not worthy of praiſe and reward for his holineſs. It follows then that the moſt abſolute moral neceſſity to do good, is perfectly conſiſtent with praiſe and reward. The ſame appears from a conſideration of the ſtate of holy men and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in Heaven. And from the ſame conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it appears that abſolute moral neceſſity to do good, and abſolute moral inability to do evil, are conſiſtent with commands and prohibitions: For though ſaints and angels in Heaven are under an abſolute moral neceſſity of being holy, and an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute moral inability to do evil, yet they are all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of commands and prohibitions. This is plain from the general tennor of ſcripture.</p>
            <p>That abſolute moral neceſſity to do good, ſo as to perſevere in holineſs, is conſiſtent with praiſe and reward; commands and prohibitions, might be proved alſo from the ſtate of thoſe who are regenerated. For, "Whoſoever is born of God doth not commit ſin; (ſays the apoſtle John) for his ſeed remaineth in him: And he cannot ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is born of God." But, Sir, if you will not allow this argument to be concluſive, you cannot deny but that I have mentioned ſome which are concluſive with regard to this matter.</p>
            <p>Since then abſolute <hi>moral</hi> neceſſity to do <hi>good</hi> is perfectly conſiſtent with commands and prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions, praiſe and reward, why ſhould not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute <hi>moral</hi> neceſſity to do <hi>evil,</hi> be conſiſtent with commands and prohibitions, blame and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? No reaſon I preſume can be given. But
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:026710_0029_0FD1633C0C9C0700"/>
there is no need of reſting the matter here: For the arguments to prove this fact are various, and ſuch as amount, I conceive to abſolute demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I will mention two or three; of which I deſire particular notice may be taken.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place then. All, I preſume, will agree to the following propoſitions. God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all mankind to render at all times univerſal obedience to the law we are under; to live and the entirely free from ſin And he conſiders us blamable and puniſhable for every tranſgreſſion, however ſmall. But for want of good hearts all mankind cannot thus render at all times, univerſal obedience. Notwithſtanding all Chriſt has done, 'tis impoſſible for all mankind to live and die mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral agents without tranſgreſſing the law they are under ſome time or other It follows then that abſolute moral neceſſity to do <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> is conſiſtent with commands, with blame and puniſhment. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> inevitably follows, if there be, or ever has been a ſingle individual of mankind thus under neceſſity from an evil heart, of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing at any time, in any inſtance, the law he is or was under, whether that be the law of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, the Moſaic or Adamic law. Indeed, it is ſo far from being the caſe that <hi>all</hi> mankind can thus live and die without ſinning, that <hi>no mere</hi> man ſince the laſt ever has been or ever will be <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> notwithſtanding all Chriſt has done, thus to render univerſal obedience from the time he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came or ſhall become a moral agent to the time of his death All, on account of evil <hi>hearts,</hi> do <hi>neceſſarily</hi> and <hi>unavoidably</hi> ſin ſooner or later. This is a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> evident from ſcripture. And it is what Mr. F—r himſelf allows in a great
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:026710_0030_0FD1633E1FB5E3B0"/>
variety of places, as every one muſt be ſenſible who has ever read his works. It appears then to a demonſtration that moral neceſſity to do evil, and moral inability to do good, are perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with commands and prohibitions, blame and puniſhment. The ſame appears from a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the ſtate of the devils and damned, and of thoſe who are given up to a reprobate mind: For they are all blamable and puniſhable, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the ſins which brought them into that ſtate, but alſo for thoſe which they now commit; and which they are under an abſolute neceſſity of committing. From a great variety of ſuch argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and from many expreſs paſſages of ſcripture to this effect that, "They that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God," and that many cannot, like the apoſtle, do the things that they would and ought to do; 'tis evident that abſolute moral ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to do evil, and abſolute moral inability to do good, are perfectly conſiſtent with commands and prohibitions, blame and puniſhment. The ſame then we may ſafely lay down as an eternal maxim of truth abundantly taught in the holy oricles of God</p>
            <p>Now, Sir, if you will take this maxim; and make it your compaſs, as being a plain doctrine of ſcripture, you will ſteer clear of the rock up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which Mr. F—r has ſplit, and made ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck. And I preſume you can avoid it in no other way: For ſuppoſe God had ſuffered Adam to propagate his fallen race without ever provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Saviour for them. They would as Mr. F—r tells us, have had nothing but <hi>helpleſſneſs;</hi> nothing but <hi>ſin.</hi> They muſt neceſſarily have gone on in ſin and wickedneſs. But this neceſſity
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:026710_0031_0FD1633F0E2A5BA8"/>
would have been wholly of the <hi>moral</hi> kind; or ſuch as would have proceeded from the <hi>ſtate</hi> of their wills. And ſuch a neceſſity we have found to be perfectly conſiſtent with blame and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and conſequently with a righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Therefore, God could, conſiſtently with his perfections, have blamed and puniſhed the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len race of Adam, for their actual and perſonal wickedneſs; notwithſtanding they would have been under an abſolute <hi>moral</hi> neceſſity of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it. Allowing this to be the caſe, we may clearly ſee how it is that, after the fall, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs could not come by the law to any man. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently we may ſee the great neceſſity of a Saviour, and alſo the grace there is in the gift of Chriſt as a redeemer.</p>
            <p>From what I have here ſaid, you may form ſome idea, Sir, of the great diſtinction which is made between <hi>natural</hi> neceſſity and inability, and <hi>moral</hi> I have here but juſt hinted to you the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. If you are diſpoſed to make further enquiery reſpecting this matter, I would refer you to what Preſident Edwards has ſaid upon the ſubject in his piece on the human will. The whole of it is worthy of your cloſe attention. At the ſame time, by reading this book, and comparing the ſame with your favorite author's repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, you will ſee for yourſelf one of Mr. F—r's groſs miſrepreſentations. The moſt charitable concluſion is that this writer had never read it.</p>
            <p>From what I have here ſuggected you may ſee alſo, if you act a candid part, where the fallacy lies of Mr. F—r's reaſoning againſt the Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtic

doctrines of the ſovereignty of grace, the abſolute decrees of God, regeneration, faith and repentance. The whole force of a great part of his arguments againſt theſe doctrines, depends upon the truth of this one propoſition, That there is no difference between <hi>moral</hi> neceſſity and inability, and <hi>natural,</hi> as to nature. In all his reaſonings, declamations, and addreſſes to the paſſions of mankind with regard to theſe things, he made a practice of comparing the neceſſity and inability which ariſe from the ſtate of the will or heart; to the neceſſity and inability which ariſe from the ſtate of the bodily powers or natural faculties. That this is in fact the caſe every one muſt be ſenſible who has ever read this author's works.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, where has Mr. F—r ſhown that theſe two kinds of neceſſity and inability are not thus different in their nature? He has not ſo much as attempted it in any of his works whch I have read: Whereas this ought to have been one of his firſt ſteps. Since, therefore, he has taken no notice of this diſtinction between <hi>natural</hi> neceſſity and <hi>moral,</hi> we who make it, and maintain that it is taken from ſcripture, ſhall, till it is ſhown to be groundleſs, conſider as vain and futile all his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, declamations, and addreſſes whoſe whole force depend upon there being no ſuch diſtinction in nature. The greater part of the learned world make this diſtinction. And I truſt that the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures make it. And it is a diſtinction upon which much indeed depends. If, therefore, you would act a fair and candid part, never more uſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments whoſe whole force depends upon there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

no ſuch diſtinction; till you have ſhown that it is groundleſs.</p>
            <p>Finally, from what has been ſaid, you may ſee alſo how difficult it is to form a conſiſtent ſcheme of religion, or to reconcile the doctrines of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with each other, without granting that <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> neceſſity and <hi>moral</hi> inability are conſiſtent with commands and prohibitions, praiſe and blame, rewards and puniſhments. No writer ever la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured harder perhaps to exclude all kinds of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and inability from his ſcheme, than Mr. F—r has done. But with what ſucceſs, I leave for the candid, who may read what I have here written, to judge. For my own part I am fully and firmly of the opinion that the doctrines of ſcripture can be reconciled with each other, in no other way than by allowing that <hi>moral</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to do evil is conſiſtent with commands, with blame and puniſhment; and that <hi>moral</hi> neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to do good is conſiſtent with commands, with praiſe and reward. But I profeſs to be one whole mind is open to conviction. And I hope that you will manifeſt yourſelf to be a ſerious and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did enquirer after divine truth. May He, then, who is the Wiſe Diſpoſer of all events, lead to a ſaving knowledge of the truth, you,</p>
