            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>YOU cannot eaſily imagine what a grateful En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment I always have, when any Lines come to me from <hi>your</hi> obliging Hand. I am particularly bound to thank you for your <hi>laſt</hi> very acceptable Letter; which was the more welcome, for the kind <hi>Preſents</hi> that accompany'd it. The <hi>Defence of the Modeſt Proof,</hi> which you ſent me, appears in <hi>my</hi> Eyes, as you ſay it does in yours, A Peece of ſo ſingular a Complexion and Make (ſurely perfect in its kind) that I know not how to model my Countenance when I read it, whether for Laughter, for Indignation, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion. An extraordinary BOOK it is, as well for the Stile and Method, as for the peculiar Vein of Argument running through the Body of the Work; and muſt needs therefore make a very admirable Appearance on the Stage of Literature. Undoubtedly the <hi>Author</hi> is ſome mighty Chief; ſome great Maſter at the Art of Wrangling, and us'd to throw the Ball of Contention; a Man fit to be the <hi>Champion</hi> of ſo diſtinguiſh'd a Party, and doubtleſs the moſt accompliſh'd Hand they could pick out to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002636_0004_0FE5D74E6520BED8"/>
the Reſcue of their <hi>baffl'd Cauſe.</hi> Pity indeed but that ſuch rare Talents ſhould be diſplay'd, and not lie ruſting in a Corner. Tho' equally a Pity 'tis, they had not been employ'd on a more worthy and defenſible Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. For I doubt he will ſhrink in his Figure, and come off with Shame: Since we often ſee the greateſt <hi>Wits</hi> miſcarry in a bold Diſpute for want of a good Cauſe, as well as others of leſs Skill, for want of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. However it ſeems He was reſolv'd for once to venture, and comes into the Field with an unequal'd Zeal and Courage; perhaps <hi>truſting in his Armour</hi> more than in his Cauſe. He bravely enters the Lifts with <hi>ſeveral</hi> Adverſaries together: And upon a view of them, taking 'em to be little impotent Animals, capable only to <hi>biſs</hi> and <hi>ſpit their Venom,</hi> he deſpiſes and derides them, as <hi>Goliah</hi> (the famous Philiſtine of <hi>Gath,</hi> that proud Giant, who deſy'd the Armies of <hi>Iſrael</hi>) diſdain'd his Antagoniſt, <hi>David,</hi> as a puny STRIPLING; by no meant an equal Match for ſuch a valiant, experienc'd Warrior as He. This Hero <hi>finds a ſtrong Reluctance in encountring</hi> them; and ſcorns to be in Earneſt, to put out his Strength, or ſhew his Skill: but only makes a few inſignificant Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, and harmleſs undeſigning Paſſes. He appears con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, like a Man in <hi>Jeſt,</hi> only to ſport and play with them as <hi>Children:</hi> thinking perhaps, that it would be too a great an <hi>Honour</hi> put upon <hi>Them,</hi> and too much an <hi>Abuſe</hi> of his <hi>own</hi> Intellectual Powers and Learning, to go to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and debate with Them in Earneſt.— Or elſe He ſus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that a <hi>Rational</hi> Defenſe of the <hi>Mod. Proof</hi> and <hi>the Diſcourſe</hi> might poſſibly prove a <hi>laborious Taſk,</hi> that wou'd coſt him a great Deal of Time, and be too long a Diverſion from his better Employments. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he generally contents himſelf with peremptory Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, warm Harangues, and witty Deſcants: ſumming up all (O the happineſs he muſt needs feel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) in glorious and triumphant Concluſions; tho' (alas) ſupported by little other Evidence, than the Aſſurance wherewith he lays them down.</p>
            <p>INDEED, in that part of his Performance, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns <hi>me</hi> more particularly, and which the following
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002636_0005_0FE5D771E5D9C9F0"/>
Sheets are pointed againſt, (I mean the <hi>ſix laſt</hi> pages of his <hi>Appendix</hi>) He here <hi>varies</hi> his Mine and Shape very wonderfully; puts on ſome Features both of the <hi>Gentleman</hi> &amp; the <hi>Scholar;</hi> and not only regales me with unuſual Airs of Civility, but alſo makes ſome Efforts to ſtate &amp; argue matters like a <hi>Diſputant.</hi> For when a Man's Paſſion, or his Humour of Jeſting, has talkt it ſelf out of breath, many times his Reaſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers, and takes its turn to ſpeak.— Now therefore, to retaliate his Kindneſs, I ſhall ſtudy, thro' the whole of my Reply to him, to preſerve a due <hi>Temper;</hi> and ſhall do him the Juſtice to repreſent his Arguments fairly, allow 'em their utmoſt Force, and give 'em a ſober Conſideration, a diſtinct Examination, and more large and particular than is really needful: becauſe I'm willing to ſpare no pains in ſearching out the Truth in this diſputed Subject; and that (if poſſible) I may help caſt ſuch a Light on the Controverſy, as to ſatisfy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Inquirers. Therefore I ſhall make uſe of the <hi>Hints</hi> in my Antagoniſt, as occaſions to ſpeak <hi>largely</hi> to things. Indeed, were the Diſpute between us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready drawn out to any conſiderable Length, I ſhou'd paſs over his brief <hi>Animadverſions</hi> with general &amp; ſhort Glances. For I ſuppoſe all that is neceſſary in a way of <hi>Reply</hi> to <hi>Them,</hi> might be compris'd in a very few Pages; as few, I preſume, as thoſe he has beſtow'd on me. 'Tis but a ſmall part of the <hi>Appendix,</hi> that's affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by what he has advanc'd againſt it; and what he has offer'd, ſeems to have ſo little Strength in it, that ſome have thought a labour'd Anſwer would be too great a Complement to him. However, for the Reaſons hinted, I ſhall <hi>take occaſion</hi> from his Animadverſions, to handle the Points, that may fall in my way, ſomewhat <hi>largely.</hi> This muſt be remembred, or elſe I fear you'l cenſure me in many places, as laboriouſly &amp; vainly ſkirmiſhing with a Shadow. Which being premis'd, let me now without any further Ceremony or Apology come to the Remarks I have to offer.</p>
            <p>I can eaſily forgive him the Blunder he begins with, in ſaying, <hi>The Author often varies Shapes &amp; Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002636_0006_0FE5D77387299E40"/>
for now he perſonates an Independent, and anon a Ruling Elder:</hi> — as if there were no Ruling Elders among the Independents.</p>
            <p>I will alſo paſs over his next Reflection, which carries in it a Random-Shot at the <hi>Sectaries,</hi> who (he ſays) <hi>do all militate under the ſame common Standard of Schiſm and Rebellion:</hi> — for I am no more concern'd in this Obſervation than himſelf. Diſmiſſing it then as wholly foreign; I come to his three <hi>Preliminaries,</hi> which are deſign'd to <hi>give a juſt Turn of Thought to thoſe that have been under an unhappy Biaſs in the Controverſy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. AND here I concur with him, in the Subſtance of his <hi>first</hi> Preliminary, touching <hi>the Nature of the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolical Commiſſion,</hi> where he obſerves, <hi>That it is on all hands agreed to be the Grand Charter for the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Miniſtry;</hi> That <hi>it contains more in its Nature than is expreſſed;</hi> and that <hi>the Intent and Purport of it must be gathered from the Practice of the Apoſtles, as they underſtood and explained it in their acting by and upon it.</hi> Here, I confeſs, is <hi>a juſt Turn of Thought,</hi> but ſuch a one as gives an unhappy Blow to his own Cauſe.</p>
            <p>OBSERVE, He allows the <hi>Apoſtolical Commiſſion</hi> to be the <hi>grand Charter</hi> for the <hi>Evangelical Miniſtry.</hi> By which, if I underſtand him right, he means, That this is the <hi>Diploma Regium,</hi> the Royal Warrant, Licenſe, or Patent, by which every true Goſpel-Miniſter claims, or is authoriz'd and impower'd. I ſuppoſe He will conſent to the Words of his Friend (and perhaps Countryman) <hi>Barclay,</hi> who thus expreſſeth his Senſe of the Matter, (in his <hi>Perſuaſive,</hi> pag. 91.) <hi>It is by virtue of the Commiſſion given to the</hi> Apoſtles <hi>by our Saviour, that any Man is an authorized Miniſter: And if it is not by virtue of this Commiſſion, that</hi> ALL <hi>Goſpel-Miniſters are autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riz'd, I deſire any one to ſhew what Authority they have and where it is founded.</hi> — Here is a good Comment on that Conceſſion of my Animadverter. But perhaps it may be better to compare it with another Paſſage of his own elſewhere, which ſufficiently explains his Senſe.
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002636_0007_0FE5D735866271F8"/>
It is in his <note n="†" place="bottom">N.B. I call it <hi>His,</hi> (and ſhall go upon this Preſumption in ſome further Obſervations afterwards) becauſe of the near <hi>Affinity</hi> betwixt the ſtrain of <hi>Reaſoning</hi> in the <hi>Def.</hi> and in the <hi>Animadv,</hi> and becauſe there are ſome very <hi>peculiar</hi> Turns of <hi>Language</hi> common to them both, &amp;c. which ſpeaks them to be hammer'd on the ſame Anvil.</note> 
               <hi>Defence</hi> of <hi>Mod. Proof,</hi> (pag. 61.) where ſpeaking of the Apoſtolical Commiſſion, he affirms, <hi>That there are ſeveral Things contained in it, and ſeveral Offices warranted by it, as the Powers of Preaching, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministring the Sacraments, Ordination, and Government by proper Officers, and that</hi> ALL <hi>that diſcharge</hi> ANY <hi>of thoſe Functions, act by virtue of</hi> THIS <hi>Commiſſion.</hi> — Now I do aſſert, He has by theſe Conceſſions given a fatal wound to the Cauſe of Prelacy; and muſt think ſo, till he ſhall refute my Remarks on the like Expreſſions of Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi>'s, (See the <hi>Appendix,</hi> pag. 31,— 38.) where I have ſhewn, That hereby he hath diſarm'd himſelf of his Herculean Argument, from the <hi>Seventy,</hi> and has put it intirely out of his power, by any other Medium what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, to prove the Divine Right of Prelacy. I deſire my Animadverter wou'd conſult the Pages cited, and let us have his Animadverſions upon them, as he wou'd do Juſtice to his Cauſe.</p>
            <p>I agree with him, in the Remainder of his firſt Prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, viz. <hi>That the Apoſtles Commiſſion contains more in its nature than is expreſſed, and that the Purport of it muſt be gather'd from their Practice upon it</hi> —. But then we muſt carefully obſerve the allow'd Diſtinction between their <hi>ordinary</hi> and their <hi>extraordinary</hi> Powers and actions. It is acreed on all ſides, That the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had ſome <hi>peculiar</hi> Powers, that were <hi>extraordinary,</hi> and <hi>temporary,</hi> and expir'd with their Perſons: by virtue whereof they did this &amp; t'other extraordinary <hi>Action,</hi> that can't be drawn into a Preſident for After-Ages, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford only ſuch Officers, as ſucceed them in their <hi>ordinary Powers.</hi>— Under this head, the Author of <hi>Mod.

            <p>IN the firſt place, we may obſerve, While the Apoſtles remain'd at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> after Chriſt's Aſcenſion, (which <hi>Euſebius</hi> reports, was for <hi>ſeveral Years</hi>) they acted in a complete <hi>Parity:</hi> and even <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> (who ſeemed to be <hi>Pillars,</hi> as much as <hi>James,</hi> pretended to be

               </gap> the <hi>Apoſtles &amp; Elders</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and it is ſaid. <hi>The</hi> Apoſtles and Elders <hi>came together to conſider of this matter: and there</hi> was <hi>much Diſputing:</hi> and when they were come to a Determination, the Reſult paſſed in the Names of them all without Diſtinction. [The <hi>Decrees</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>ordained of the Apoſtles &amp; Elders.]</hi> Then they <hi>all agreed</hi> to ſend choſen Men or their own Company, with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> to carry their Letters to <hi>Anticch.</hi> So that in all the managements in the Church at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> hitherto, there appears not the leaſt ſign or ſhadow of a Prelacy. And doubtleſs all other Churches were form'd after the ſame Model with that.</p>
            <p>MOREOVER, obſerve, when the Apoſtles planted a Church in any Place, they ſettled a <hi>Plurality</hi> of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters in it. Thus we read, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.23. <hi>Paul &amp; Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas ordained them Elders in every Church.</hi> A number of Elders; and no mention of a Biſhop <hi>ſet over</hi> them.</p>
            <p>THESE Elders were themſelves <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and <hi>Church-Rulers.</hi> My <hi>Animadverter</hi> himſelf ſhall be my Voucher for this; who tells us, that the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> which the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſettled in the Churches,</hi> and particularly <hi>thoſe at Corinth, had the Powers both of Sacraments &amp; Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures:</hi> and for proof he alledges 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5, 7, 12, 13. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2 6.

We ſhall find they paſſed the higheſt Church-Cenſure on the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous Perſon; and then abſolv'd him again upon his Repentance.

               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:002636_0010_0FE5D77E5C6BDD18"/>AND indeed this is but agreeable to the Doctrine of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> as it may be gather'd out of the <hi>Public Offices;</hi> where we find <hi>Presbyters</hi> receiving a pretty advanc'd Character, as <hi>Rulers</hi> and Paſtors. Thus, They ſeem to have Authority over the <hi>Deacons,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the <hi>Deacons</hi> Ordination-Vow, wherein They promiſe <hi>Reverently to obey Their Ordinary</hi> [the Biſhop's Suffragan, who is at beſt but a Presbyter] <hi>and other chief Miniſters of the Church</hi> [Presbyters ſtill] AND <hi>Them to whom the Charge &amp; Government over them is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted:</hi> By whom, I ſuppoſe, was originally intended the <hi>Paſtors</hi> of the reſpective Congregations, to which thoſe Deacons were imploy'd to miniſter. As ſeems very probable, if we compare the Promiſe here, with that of the <hi>Prieſts;</hi> which runs in a different ſtrain: The Prieſt promiſing to obey his <hi>Ordinary, and other chief Miniſters, unto whom is committed</hi> &amp;c. Where the Form of Expreſſion is alter'd. Here it is—<hi>Chief Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, unto whom—.</hi> Whereas in the former Office, it is—<hi>Chief Ministers,</hi> AND <hi>Them to whom—.</hi> Which material Variation of the Form ſeems plainly to ſpeak the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> who are a ſuperior order unto <hi>Deacons,</hi> to have committed to them a Government over Thoſe of this <hi>inferior Office,</hi> who miniſter in their Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.—But however it be in that Caſe, be ſure the <hi>Presbyters</hi> have (according to the Engliſh Model) a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Power over the <hi>Flock.</hi> If we look into the <hi>Form of ordering Prieſts,</hi> we ſhall find a great deal to countenance this Aſſertion. Thus in the Charge that is given them the Figures of <hi>Shepherds, Watchmen, Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> and <hi>Stewards</hi> of the Lord, are purſued, and the Places of Scripture, relating to Theſe are applied to them. And then in the Ordination-Vow, the Biſhop takes a Promiſe of them, <hi>That they will give their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Diligence ſo to miniſter the Doctrine and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the</hi> Diſcipline <hi>of Chriſt, as the Lord hath commanded,—unto the People committed to their</hi> Cure <hi>and</hi> Charge: — <hi>and that they will be ready with all faithful Diligence to</hi> Baniſh <hi>and</hi> DRIVE away <hi>all er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous and ſtrange Doctrines,</hi> &amp;c. And then, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, at the Impoſition of Hands, the <hi>Biſhop</hi> ſays to
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002636_0011_0FE5D77F3B4FE620"/>
the <hi>Priest</hi> ordained, — <hi>Whoſe Sins</hi> Thou <hi>dost forgive, they are forgiven; and whoſe Sins</hi> thou <hi>doſt retain, they are retained.</hi> Which are the expreſs Words of the <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Commiſſion, <hi>John</hi> 20 — And tho' theſe words are order'd to be read for the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> at the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> yet they are not <hi>repeated</hi> in the Form of Ordination, or at the Impoſition of Hands: for which I cannot think of a more natural <hi>Reaſon</hi> than this, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe the Office of <hi>Presbyter</hi> ſtill ſubſiſts in the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> unto which <hi>all</hi> the Power imply'd in <hi>thoſe Words</hi> do properly belong; and the Presbyter receives no <hi>new</hi> or ſuperadded Power, as of <hi>Divine Right,</hi> at his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration to the Epiſcopate, but only is advanced to a Degree of Dignity and Authority, that has ariſen out of ſome <hi>prudential Constitutions</hi> Eccleſiaſtical and Civil: and therefore the Repetition or Delivery of the <hi>Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Commiſſion to him, upon this Preferment, is tho't un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary. So that (as I hinted in the <hi>Appendix,</hi> pag. 24.) it ſhould ſeem that the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſuppoſes her <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> to be equally veſted with the Power of <hi>Diſcipline, according to the Word of GOD;</hi> and what <hi>Difference</hi> there is in the Exerciſe of it, muſt be grounded on <hi>Human</hi> Conſtitutions. And indeed this Diſtinction is hinted to us, when the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> at his Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, promiſes — <hi>to correct and puniſh the Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous within his Dioceſs, according to ſuch Authority as be</hi> hath <hi>by God's</hi> Word, &amp; <hi>as to him ſhall be committed by the ordinance of</hi> this Realm. — Upon the whole it appears that my <hi>Animadverter</hi> has ſpoken the original Senſe of his own Church, as well as confeſſed to a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Doctrine, in aſſerting the <hi>Presbyters</hi> having <hi>the Powers both of Sacraments and Cenſures.</hi> — But if I miſtake not, this Conceſſion, which the force of Teach (more perhaps than the want of Thought) has extorted from him, will prove the utter <hi>Subverſion</hi> of his <hi>Cauſe,</hi> For it is one of the firſt Principles in his Scheme, <hi>That the Powers of Government and Ordination are annexed, alia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,</hi> connected. This is a Maxim the Gentleman oft inculcates, and is what Epiſcopalians generally maintain. Now they that have <hi>the Powers both of Sacraments and Cenſures,</hi> muſt be own'd to have the governing Power in
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002636_0012_0FE5D780098BE0D0"/>
their Hands. He that denies this, muſt certainly have a very odd Turn of Thought; and my Animadverter muſt needs be <hi>under an unhappy Biaſs</hi> (indeed) <hi>in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy,</hi> if he denies Presbyters the power of <hi>Ordination,</hi> after he has thus aſſerted their governing Power, and proclaim'd them Parochial Biſhops.</p>
            <p>BUT perhaps he may <hi>object:</hi> This Arguing is vain; for there muſt this neceſſary Diſtinction be obſerv'd, <hi>That the Government,</hi> with which <hi>Ordination</hi> is connected, <hi>is not that of meer</hi> Presbyters <hi>over their ſingle Flocks, but that of</hi> Dioceſan Biſhops <hi>over a Plurality of Churches and their Paſtors. The Government of</hi> Prelates, <hi>and that of</hi> Presbyters, <hi>are two different ſorts of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and the Government which the Power of</hi> Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>was annexed to, is that of</hi> Prelates <hi>taken in its proper preſent Eccleſiaſtical Senſe, and not that that meer</hi> Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters <hi>have over their ſingle Congregations.</hi> So he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhes in his <hi>Def. of Mod. Proof,</hi> p. 21.</p>
            <p>TO which I anſwer, That this Diſtinction appears to be <hi>without any juſt Foundation.</hi> For there are not two ſuch different Species of Church-Governours, as he ſpeaks of. Either <hi>Presbyters</hi> have the <hi>complete</hi> Power of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Rule, or they have <hi>none</hi> at all. The latter is contrary to the declared Senſe of my Animadverter: He expreſly allows them a <hi>Government over their Flocks,</hi> even <hi>the Powers both of Sacraments and Cenſures;</hi> which implies, I think, no ſmall Degree of Authority veſted in them: But how fatal to his Argument, is this Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legement! He here laſhes his own Error; and turns Traitor to his own Cauſe.— For I ask the Gentleman, how he ſuppoſes the <hi>Presbyters</hi> came by ſo much ruling Power? What <hi>Commiſſion</hi> is it founded in? For, if it doth not reſult from ſome Divine Commiſſion, that they are inveſted with, <hi>it is a very criminal Preſumption and an unſufferable Inſolence in Them</hi> to lay claim to it: <hi>a daring Offence</hi> it muſt needs be, equal at leaſt to what They are guilty of, who <hi>approach before God's Altar without the appointed Rites of Conſecration.</hi> I ask then, What Commiſſion it is founded in? Is it the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002636_0013_0FE5D73793072B88"/>
Commiſſion of the <hi>Seventy?</hi> No ſurely; for that doth not contain <hi>the Powers both of Sacraments and Cenſures.</hi> Where then ſhall we look to find the original of this their governing Power? Shall we repair to <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. and refer it to the <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Commiſſion? <hi>Yes;</hi> for if it be not imply'd <hi>there,</hi> it is no where in the Bible. And beſides the Gentleman himſelf, (in his <hi>Def. of Mod. Proof,</hi> p. 61.) vouches this for their Warrant, and expreſly affirms, <hi>That it is</hi> by vertue <hi>of this Commiſſion,</hi> that Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters <hi>diſcharge the Function of Preaching and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring the Sacraments, and exerciſe the Powers of Abſolution and Cenſures.</hi> Well but if that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion belongs to them, which is the <hi>higheſt</hi> in the Church, how can there be any ſuppos'd of a <hi>ſuperior</hi> Order to Them? And how come the <hi>Presbyters</hi> to have any Title or Relation at all to <hi>that</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; which was given immediately to the twelve <hi>Apostles,</hi> and <hi>not</hi> to the <hi>Seventy Diſciples?</hi> Why truly here is the Difficulty, and the <hi>Self-repugnance,</hi> in our Animadverter's Scheme. For it is a Paradox to me, That <hi>Presbyters</hi> ſhould have a <hi>governing Power</hi> in the Church, by <hi>vertue</hi> of the Commiſſion given to the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> and yet really be no more than Succeſſors to the <hi>Seventy Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> whoſe Commiſſion contain'd <hi>nothing</hi> of ſuch an Eccleſiaſtical Authority. I wonder by what new Logick the Gentleman will be able to accommodate theſe two jarring Principles of his. He has caſt his Cauſe upon a palpable Contradiction; and while he eſſays to gore us with <hi>both Horns</hi> at once, we may hope to eſcape without Harm from either.</p>
            <p>FURTHERMORE, As to theſe governing Presbyters it may be obſerved, we find none of them claiming a <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority over their Brethren;</hi> nay, the very <hi>Apostles</hi> themſelves made no pretenſions to any <hi>Supremacy,</hi> or Prelatical Power over them, as Officers of another and higher Order. We do not find that the Apoſtles claim'd a <hi>Negative</hi> upon the ordinary Paſtors, and the Churches, in matters of Government, nor ſo much as a Right of Precedency, as ſuperior Officers. They own'd <hi>Presbyters</hi> (as in the forementioned caſe of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Elders)
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002636_0014_0FE5D7831FC8F298"/>
to have the <hi>Power of the Keys,</hi> and ſeem to know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their being limited to exerciſe them by <hi>Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical</hi> Direction and Conſent. — And in the caſe of <hi>Miſſions,</hi> the Apoſtles uſed no coercive Power over the Presbyters, but took their <hi>free Conſent;</hi> without which they went not. Thus the Apoſtle Paul told the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> (1 Epiſ. 16.12) <hi>As touching our Brother</hi> Apollos, <hi>I greatly deſired him to come unto you with the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, but his Will was not at all to come at this Time; but he will come, when he ſhall have convenient Time.</hi> Now, according to the Author of <hi>Mod. Proof,</hi> (pag. 30.) <hi>Apollos</hi> was but a <hi>Presbyter;</hi> and yet you ſee he acted his own Inclinations, in oppoſition to Apoſtolical Intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: which betokens but little Senſe of any Subjection to the Apoſtle, as his Superior and Ruler.</p>
            <p>BUT, in a word; whatſoever <hi>clear Indication</hi> may be pretended <hi>of a Diſtinction &amp; Subordination between the Presbyters and the Apoſtles,</hi> the ſame is equally clear with reſpect to ſome others that are ſuppoſed to be <hi>Prelates;</hi> who appear to be as much in Subjection to the Apoſtles, as the Presbyters. For Inſtance, <hi>Timothy</hi> is ſaid to <hi>minister</hi> unto <hi>Paul,</hi> to be <hi>ſent</hi> by him hither and thither, to receive <hi>Commandment</hi> from him <hi>&amp;c:</hi> Which carries as plain Signatures of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Juriſdiction over this ſuppoſed <hi>Prelate,</hi> as are any where to be ſeen of his Juriſdiction over Presbyters. Now, (ſuppoſing that to be in fact a proper Exerciſe of <hi>Authority</hi>) I put it to my Animadverter, — Whether he looks on the Apoſtle as therein acting by an <hi>ordinary</hi> Power, or by an <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary?</hi> Or, in other words, Whether or no He looks on this <hi>Apoſtolic Practice</hi> as giving us any <hi>Explanation</hi> of the <hi>Commiſſion?</hi> And take it which way he will, I ask how he can reconcile it with <hi>his</hi> Scheme of Things. For, if he ſuppoſes the Apoſtle to act herein by and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Apoſtolical Commiſſion, and ſo explaining it, and leaving a Precedent; then it ſeems (according to the Animadverter's way of arguing) we muſt not only have Prelates in the Church, but alſo <hi>another</hi> order <hi>ſuperior</hi> to Them: and thus there will be more than <hi>three</hi> orders; which is contrary to his own Scheme. — But if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002636_0015_0FE5D7872DD84078"/>
the Apoſtle's Practice, in regard of his Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over <hi>Timothy, not</hi> to be an Explanation of the Apoſtolic Commiſſion, then ſay I, no more is the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, that the Apoſtles are ſuppoſed to have exerciſed over <hi>Preſbyters.</hi> For (to borrow here a ſhort Parentheſis from the <hi>Remarker</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Sob. Rem.</hi> p. 38. Edit. 2.</note>) <q>No man is able to give me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tolerable reaſon, why their Government over <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> ſhou'd be grounded on an <hi>extraordinary</hi> Power, and yet their Government over <hi>Paſtors</hi> be by virtue of their <hi>ordinary</hi> Power.</q> Whatever Authority over them the Apoſtles may be ſuppos'd to have had, it did not reſult from their ordinary Commiſſion: and ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords no Pattern to ſucceeding Ages, nor gives the leaſt Countenance to Prelatical Uſurpations.</p>
            <p>SO then, upon the Whole, I may very juſtly draw up this Concluſion (the Reverſe of my <hi>Animadverter's) That if following the Explanations given of this Commiſſion by Apoſtolick Practice be warrantable, the Aſsertors of</hi> Preſbyterian Parity <hi>are undoubtedly in the Right.</hi>—</p>
            <p>BEFORE I paſs to his next general head, I might take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of what he inſinuates here (1) concerning the <hi>Deacons, That we find in Fact, that the Apoſtles ordained them; beſides ſome lower Offices, to preach and baptiſe.</hi> — By this he muſt mean, Either that <hi>we find they in fact or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd</hi> the Deacons to the works of <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing;</hi> which is directly <hi>contrary</hi> to the Account we have of their Inſtitution, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. <hi>begin.</hi> — Or elſe that <hi>we find in Fact</hi> the Deacons <hi>did</hi> preach and baptiſe, &amp; from thence muſt <hi>infer</hi> they were <hi>ordain'd</hi> to theſe Offices. Now if this be his Meaning, let him conſult the <hi>Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix</hi> (pag. 38, &amp;c.) and he will find I have ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd the Vanity of ſuch Pretences, in a way of Arguing too ſomewhat different from the <hi>Remarker;</hi> ſo that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to <hi>him</hi> will not ſuffice for a Reply to <hi>Me:</hi> and yet the <hi>Animadverter</hi> ſilently paſſes over my Obſervations on this Head, as he has done in many other Inſtances — And now, as to what he affirms in the next Place, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Presbyters, That thoſe which the Apostles ſettled in

Nay, he turns it over to a <hi>Lay Chancellor,</hi> and other <hi>Officials</hi> of that Court, who have not any inherent and proper Eccleſiaſtical Authority, but are <hi>deputed</hi> by the Biſhop; and whoſe Acts, tho' they always run in the Biſhop's <hi>Name,</hi> yet are not always paſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

HAVING thus <hi>adjuſted</hi> the firſt Preliminary, I paſs now to the <hi>Second,</hi> which concerns <hi>the Nature of the Gift conferred in Ordination;</hi> where he affirms that <hi>thereby is unquestionably meant the Office &amp; the Power whereby to diſcharge it, and not the Holy Ghost.</hi> Upon which I ſhall not enter into any Controverſy with Him, but taking him in his own way, will paſs it over, with only two or three Reflections.</p>
            <p>IN the firſt place, I think, the Gentleman delivers his Opinion with too great an Air of Aſſurance, as if it were <hi>unquestionable;</hi> when he does or may know, that ſome of the greateſt <hi>Doctors</hi> of his own Church are <hi>againſt</hi> Him. Thus <hi>Dr. Hammond</hi> paraphraſes on 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Neglect not the Gift that is in Thee</hi> &amp;c. i. e. Make uſe of thoſe Gifts, which <hi>in order to</hi> thy Func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were given thee at thy Ordination —. And Dr. <hi>Whitby</hi> calls the <hi>Chariſma</hi> here mentioned, a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Gift, the Gift of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary</hi> Gift, conferred only in thoſe Times, by the Hands of an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> and now wholly ceaſed. [<hi>See his Notes on</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. &amp; 2. <hi>Tim</hi> 1.6] <q>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding (as he obſerves, on <hi>Act.</hi> 8.15.) This may well be deem'd a fit Pattern for <hi>Biſhops</hi> to follow in the Apoſtolical Rite of Confirmation &amp; Ordination by laying on of Hands; by which THEY, as <hi>Succeſſors</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> CONFER the <hi>ordinary</hi> Gifts of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did the <hi>extraordinary</hi> Gifts of the ſame Spirit</q>. Thus you ſee both theſe learned Expoſitors thwart my <hi>Animadverter;</hi> and yet he lays down his Opinion as <hi>unquestionably</hi> certain.</p>
            <p>BUT in the ſecond place, I would obſerve, As he is too ſanguine and dogmatical in his Aſſertions, ſo he is too <hi>looſe</hi> and <hi>careleſs</hi> in his Language upon this Point. What crude and uncouth (not to ſay, criminal and profane) Expreſſions are thoſe; when, ſpeaking of the HOLY GHOST (a Divin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>IN the laſt place, we may obſerve the <hi>Impertinence</hi> of the <hi>Reaſon</hi> He here aſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> may go for an Inſtance of ſuch Whimſy and Diſtraction.— And then, It is a Reaſon that may be eaſily <hi>turn'd upon Himſelf,</hi> and will be as valid an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt <hi>his</hi> Interpretation of the <hi>Gift</hi> mentioned, i. e. <hi>The Office &amp; the Power whereby to diſcharge it.</hi> So that here in effect he do's but c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ff his own Ears.— To ſet this in its juſt Light, let us for once admit the Hypotheſis of the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of Prelacy; and apply what the Gentleman ſays, to the Office of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> (which I the rather chuſe to do, becauſe <hi>Timothy</hi> the Perſon receiving the Gift mentioned, is voted a <hi>Prelate</hi>) and by his own way of arguing, it will appear, that every authorized <hi>Biſhop</hi> derives his <hi>Office</hi> and Power from our bleſſed <hi>Lord</hi> Himſelf, and not from his <hi>Ordainers. For tho' indeed in the Conveying of it, Means &amp; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments are made uſe of,</hi> and He is ſolemnly conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it by Faſting &amp; Prayer, with <hi>Impoſition of Hands; yet no Creature, in a proper ſenſe, can be ſaid to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it.</hi> And therefore when any ſpeak of the Biſhops <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring Orders,</hi> or of their conſecrating any to the <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copate,</hi> it muſt not be underſtood as if they did actually <hi>bestow</hi> it: <hi>their Action indeed is the Conduit of its Conveyance, but its ſelf muſt flow from the Fountain of it.</hi>— I cannot but think our Animadverter is of opinion, That <hi>Biſhops</hi> are commiſſionated immediately by their great <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Master;</hi> or, that it is <hi>He</hi> who gives the Power by <hi>His Commiſſion</hi> (the ſame that was given to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> the firſt Biſhops) and that no <hi>Creature</hi> on

Earth is nor can be a Principal Cauſe, or authoritative Donor, and Efficient in that Caſe: but that the Electors only determin the Perſon or Recipient, and the Ordainers only <hi>inveſt</hi> him, and ſolem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ize his Entrance into his Office. The <hi>Apoſtolical Commiſſion</hi> is what this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman himſelf calls the <hi>Original Charter,</hi> and ſo allows to be the <hi>Fundamentum Juris,</hi> the Scource and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Biſhop's Right &amp; Power: who claims by this, and acts upon it. And hence they that conſecrate Him, are but <hi>Ministerial Deliverers of Poſſeſſion;</hi> are but the <hi>Channels of Conveyance,</hi> and not the immediate <hi>Fountains</hi> of the Power veſted in Him. He derives this from a higher Original, from the <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> the grand <hi>Charter</hi> of CHRIST; as the <hi>Mayor</hi> of a Town-Corporate derives all his Authority from the <hi>King's Charter,</hi> which upon his Election <hi>authoriſes</hi> and obliges him to the Execution of his Office, inſtituted and deſcrib'd in the Charter; Tho' this directs alſo to a public and ſolemn <hi>Inſtalment</hi> of Him; before which he is not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe Authority, nor claim Obedience: and yet the <hi>Mayor</hi>'s Power originates <hi>wholly</hi> from the <hi>Royal Charter.</hi> Even ſo the <hi>Biſhop</hi>'s Power muſt draw it's Origin whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from <hi>Chriſt's Charter:</hi> and if they that conſecrate him to his Office, do pretend to <hi>confer</hi> it upon Him, it is as if the <hi>Recorder,</hi> who inſtalls my Lord <hi>Mayor,</hi> ſhou'd feign himſelf the Fountain or Donor of the Majoral Power; which wou'd be unpardonable Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance in him, equal to the intolerable Ignorance, which any one wou'd betray, that ſhould credit him.— Theſe Thoughts, I'm perſuaded, cannot but be very agreeable to one of my <hi>Animadverter</hi>'s Genius; ſo warm an Aſſertor of <hi>Epiſcopal Dignity!</hi> For, as our Lord ſaid to the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> Ye Fools and Blind! <hi>Whether is greater, the</hi> Gift, <hi>or the</hi> Altar <hi>that ſanctifieth the Gift?</hi> So ſay I, Whether is greater, Human Ordination, or Chriſt's Commiſſion, that alone enforces it? And, which reflects moſt Luſtre on our <hi>Biſhops,</hi> to ſay, Their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is of <hi>Men,</hi> or that it is of <hi>God;</hi> from <hi>their</hi> Impoſition of Hands, or from the Charter of CHRIST; <hi>Judge ye.</hi>— However, if any one will inſiſt upon <hi>an external viſible Commiſſion</hi> given by the <hi>Ordainers,</hi> is the

immediate Principle &amp; Support of <hi>Prelatical Power,</hi> He ſhall not have <hi>me</hi> at preſent for his <hi>Adverſary.</hi> For, as the Apoſtle ſaid to the Corinthians, <hi>Theſe Things, Brethren, I have in a figure transferred to my Self &amp; Apollo;</hi> Even ſo I have uſed ſuch a Scheme o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Speech, in arguing with my Animadverter, to gild over the Pill, that it might go down with more eaſe, and work with efficacy. And I hope I have ſaid enough to make him ſenſible, that he has built his Opinion (about the <hi>Gift</hi> mention'd) on a <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>ſandy Foundation.</hi>— Tho' as to the Opinion it ſelf, I ſuſpend; and it ſhall be no matter of Conteſt between us at preſent. But I'll now diſmiſs the Second Preliminary, and come to the <hi>Third</hi> and Laſt.</p>
            <p n="3">III. AND here I fully agree with him, <hi>That the</hi> Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles <hi>were not meer Presbyters</hi> [in the modern Senſe] but <hi>were veſted with proper Epiſcopal Powers,</hi> even the Power of Ordination and Juriſdiction. And I further grant, that they had ſome ſort of Influence and Inſpection <hi>over the Presbyters and the Churches too;</hi> yea, and over his ſuppoſed <hi>Prelates</hi> likewiſe.</p>
            <p>BUT then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o <hi>adjuſt this Preliminary,</hi> I muſt add an Obſervation or two. As,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) THAT the <hi>Epiſcopal Powers</hi> mentioned, were not <hi>peculiar</hi> to the Apoſtles, but common to all <hi>Paſtors</hi> or Presbyters: As plainly appears from what I have ſaid above, &amp; have further to offer. And then it muſt be obſerv'd, —</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) AS to the <hi>Superiority</hi> over <hi>Presbyters,</hi> aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> it is granted by me only in a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd</hi> and <hi>qualify'd</hi> Senſe. Here,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> I wou'd not be underſtood to aſſert a Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of proper imperative <hi>Prelatical Power,</hi> founded in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny peculiar Office or Commiſſion held by Them; but a <hi>directive</hi> or <hi>declarative</hi> Power; Whereby they had a Right to inſtruct Presbyters in the reveal'd Truths and Laws of the Goſpel, and inculcate their Duty upon them, to rebuke the Scandalous and Heretical, to pronounce 'em (if impenitent) unworthy of their Office, and warn the People to avoid them &amp;c. But as to any proper <hi>Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, Judicial,</hi> and <hi>Coercive</hi> Power over Them, I cannot
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002636_0021_0FE5D79302ECD720"/>
find any Footſteps of it, either in the <hi>Acts</hi> or <hi>Letters</hi> of the Apoſtles; nor any Foundation for it, either in their Commiſſion, or in any Rules of Reaſon. So that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not at preſent but conceive of the <hi>Apostles</hi> as being in relation to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church, and the Paſtors of it, very much what the inſpired <hi>Prophets</hi> in former times were to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church and its ordinary Teachers. But however,—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> I wou'd have it obſerv'd, that whatever go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Power the Apoſtles might have over <hi>Presbyters</hi> or ordinary Paſtors and the Churches. (Yea admit, if you will, it amounted even to a proper <hi>Legiſlative</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive</hi> Power) yet I do not ſuppoſe it to be <hi>Succeſſive,</hi> or deriv'd to Thoſe who ſucceed the Apoſtles; and that for this <hi>Reaſon,</hi>— Becauſe Such a Power muſt be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their <hi>extraordinary Miſſion</hi> &amp; <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> and cou'd not be any part of their <hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>ſtanding Character,</hi> or belong to them in <hi>that Capacity,</hi> wherein only they are allow'd to have <hi>Succeſſors.</hi>— I have had occaſion to ſay ſomething before, that might ſuffice for the Proof of This. But I will add, for the further Clearing of it, this Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>That the Apoſtles ordinary Capacity was</hi> SINGLE, <hi>and but one;</hi> or ſuch as wherein they cou'd repreſent but <hi>one Kind</hi> of <hi>Church-Ruler,</hi> and that is a <hi>Pariſh Rector</hi> or <hi>Paſtor</hi> of a particular Congregation, and not the <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Biſhop. Which I ſhall eſſay to prove, in ſuch a Gradati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Thought, as will make it Mathematically evident: and for the better Diſtinction, I will make uſe of Ordinal Numbers, in laying down my <hi>Propoſitions,</hi> which are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Commiſſion is the grand <hi>Charter</hi> for the Evangelical Miniſtry. This we have heard our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimadverter already confeſſing. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE <hi>whole Complex</hi> of Apoſtolical Power, in the <hi>ordinary</hi> and permanent Branches of it, was included in that one Commiſſion. And,</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE Miniſterial Powers, contained in that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, were by the Apoſtles preſerv'd <hi>undivided,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002636_0022_0FE5D793CEF27250"/>
without any <hi>Limitations,</hi> to all the Recipients of it. <note n="*" place="bottom">As I've prov'd in <hi>Appendix</hi> to <hi>Sob. Rem.</hi> (Vid. p 32—36.) which my <hi>Reſpondent</hi> having not taken notice of, nor brought any thing to invalidate the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments there offer'd, this Concluſion appears to me ſtill very well grafted on ſolid Reaſons.</note> Hence,</p>
            <p n="4">4. THEY to whom this Commiſſion truly belongs, are actually inveſted with <hi>all</hi> the Powers given in it. Now,</p>
            <p n="5">5. THOSE who are inveſted with <hi>one Commiſſion,</hi> in all the Powers of it, muſt be of one and the ſame <hi>Order</hi> or Kind. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="6">6 AS the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Commiſſion was but one, ſo their ordinary Capacity was but one, and ſuch as in which they cou'd repreſent but one kind of <hi>Church-Ruler. Q. E. D.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now—</p>
            <p n="7">7. THIS Church-Ruler is not the <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Biſhop, but the <hi>Congregational</hi> Biſhop, or Presbyter: As will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if we duly weigh things. For conſider, in the next place,</p>
            <p n="8">8. THE Government of <hi>Prelates</hi> and that of <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> are <hi>two Sorts</hi> of Government. This the Defender of the <hi>Mod. Proof</hi> takes notice of, <hi>pag.</hi> 21. Hence, in the</p>
            <p n="9">9th place, THE <hi>Prelatical</hi> Biſhop, and the <hi>Parochial,</hi> are two diſtinct Species of Officers. And conſequently, in the</p>
            <p n="10">10th place, THEY <hi>cannot both</hi> ſubſiſt on <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame</hi> Commiſſion, nor cou'd the Apoſtles repreſent them <hi>both</hi> in their ordinary Capacity: but one or t'other muſt neceſſarily be <hi>excluded.</hi> But now, in the</p>
            <p n="11">11th place, WE are agreed on all ſides, that <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational</hi> Biſhops, or <hi>Presbyters,</hi> do act in the diſcharge of their Office, <hi>by virtue</hi> of the <hi>Apostolical Commiſſion,</hi> and by it are veſted with <hi>the Powers of Preaching, and of Sacraments and Cenſures.</hi> To this we have a repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed full Confeſſion from the <hi>Animadverter.</hi> And hence, in the</p>
            <p n="12">12th place, <hi>PRESBYTERS</hi> have a juſt Claim to <hi>all</hi> the Powers contain'd in that Commiſſion, (according to

               <hi>Prop.</hi> 3 &amp; 4) and muſt be voted Succeſſors to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles in the <hi>whole</hi> of their ordinary Capacity. Which, by an unavoidable Conſequence, infers, (agreeable to <hi>Prop.</hi> 8.9. &amp; 10th.) in the—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>LAST</hi> place, That <hi>Praelatical</hi> Powers were <hi>not</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the <hi>Apostles</hi> ordinary Capacity, nor the Epiſcopal Throne erected upon the Apoſtolic Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and ſo the Dioceſan Claim muſt fall to the ground. For <hi>tho'</hi> Praelates <hi>are not excluded by Name</hi> (to allude to an Obſervation of our Anſwerer's — <hi>Def.</hi> pag. 65) <hi>Yet they are, by the Nature of Commiſſions; all Commiſſions being excluſive of all but thoſe to whom They are grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have impartially weigh'd the Gentleman's <hi>three Preliminaries, adjuſted</hi> 'em, and corrected the undue <hi>Turn of Tho't,</hi> which his Diſcourſe upon them might tend to give ſuch as are looking into <hi>this Controverſy:</hi> and hope I have left him no Room to raiſe any more Duſt, on theſe Topicks, to cloud and darken them.</p>
            <p>¶ I proceed now to conſider what he has advanc'd on two or three <hi>Texts,</hi> which he wou'd have the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>I have miſtaken &amp; miſapplied:</hi> and <hi>by ſetting of which in their true Light,</hi> he ſays, <hi>all that I have offered, will be fully reply'd to.</hi> He reſolves <hi>now to take bold on the Impartial Hand, if it is not too nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or ill-natured to be taken in its own way.</hi> Well, let him take <hi>what Hold</hi> he pleaſes, (where &amp; how he will) I hope the <hi>Impartial Hand</hi> will be <hi>nimble</hi> enough to manage him; and that without being ſo <hi>ill-natur'd</hi> as to offer any foul Play. Let unprejudic'd Standers-by judge between us. To begin then,</p>
            <p>§ 1. THE firſt Text he mentions, is 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1 6. (which ſpeaks of <hi>the putting on of</hi> Paul<hi>'s Hands</hi>) But is the wrong Text: it ſhould have been 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. which ſpeaks of <hi>the Laying on of the Hands of the</hi> Presbytery.</p>
            <p>AND here the Gentleman, in an Exceſs of good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (ſhall I ſay? or through the force of Conviction)
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002636_0024_0FE5D795AE9A1978"/>
is willing to <hi>take me in my own way, by condemning</hi> Calvin<hi>'s Inſtitutes</hi> [tho' in ſo doing, as it unhappily falls out, he condemns his own <hi>Defenſe</hi> of <hi>Mod.

               <hi>IF the Firſt,</hi> then he concludes, <hi>his Point is gained; for</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the Apostles were not only</hi> Presbyters, <hi>but</hi> Biſhops <hi>alſo in the full and ſtricteſt Senſe of the word, by the third Preliminary; and this will ſave the Credit and the Evidence of the firſt Epiſtle to</hi> Timothy <hi>for Epiſcopacy, and be exactly agreeable to the practice of the Church of</hi> England.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT, by <hi>Presbytery</hi> here, to underſtand a number of <hi>Apostles,</hi> joyning with <hi>Paul,</hi> in the Ordination of <hi>Timothy,</hi> is very <hi>irrational.</hi> 'Tis an Expoſition intirely Conjectural, and carries not the leaſt ſhadow of <hi>Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> with it.</p>
            <p>FOR (beſides other Reaſons) it is extreme unlikely that <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould beſtow on a College of <hi>Apoſtles</hi> no higher Denomination than this of <hi>a Presbytery:</hi> and then (agreeably to what I obſerv'd in <hi>Append.</hi> to <hi>Sob. Rem.</hi> pag. 18. — tho' my <hi>Animadverter</hi> has made no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to me upon it) 'tis equally improbable, that <hi>Paul</hi> (ſo humble an Apoſtle) ſhould have the Vanity to <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh</hi> himſelf from his Brethren, and <hi>exalt</hi> himſelf above them, in the manner our Opponents make him to do, by the Senſe they put upon 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. where they ſuppoſe him to affirm, <hi>That</hi> Timothy <hi>was</hi> ordained <hi>by the Laying on of</hi> His <hi>Hands;</hi> as if it were his <hi>Sole Act,</hi> and the whole Virtue and Efficacy flow'd from <hi>his</hi> Hand. Which if it be true, I cannot imagine Them to be <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> that are meant by <hi>the Presbytery:</hi> For the Apoſtles were all <hi>equally</hi> veſted with ordaining Power:
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:002636_0025_0FE5D738597B1240"/>
And it would not be conſiſtent with the uſual <hi>Modeſty</hi> and <hi>Humility</hi> of this Apoſtle's Language, in all other Caſes, when ſpeaking of Himſelf, for him to uſe ſuch a Speech in this Caſe, as excludes the Reſt of his Brethren from any ſhare in the Ordination of <hi>Timothy;</hi> which muſt be judg'd very vain, as well as falſe.</p>
            <p>However,</p>
            <p n="2">2. ADMIT that by <hi>the Presbytery</hi> is meant a College of <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> yet my <hi>Animadverter</hi> is very ſhort in his Reaſoning, and labours of a grand Miſtake, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes <hi>his Point to be gain'd thereby:</hi> nor will that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion at all hurt the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Claim and Argument from the Text under Conſideration.</p>
            <p>FOR thus I argue upon the preſent Hypotheſis: Theſe Apoſtles acted in <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Ordination, either in their ordinary or extraordinary Capacity. <hi>Not</hi> in their <hi>extra-ordinary;</hi> for then it affords no Example or Argument for Ordination by <hi>ordinary</hi> Officers. Whereas, on all ſides it is allow'd and pleaded as a <hi>ſufficient Warrant</hi> for Ordination by ordinary Officers: — therefore it was their <hi>ordinary Capacity</hi> in which they ordained. And hence they who <hi>ſucceed</hi> the Apoſtles in their whole <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Capacity,</hi> muſt be entituled to the Power of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>NOW here lies the Difficulty, to know <hi>who</hi> are their proper Succeſſors: which can be determin'd only by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring <hi>what</hi> the <hi>Apostles</hi> in their ordinary Capacity were; what Powers they had, and what Acts they did. And for our Information here we muſt look into their <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> and into their <hi>Hiſtory:</hi> both whereof have been already conſulted; and it appears from them, That the Apoſtles, conſidered in their ordinary Capacity, were only <hi>Presbyters.</hi> This has been made evident from the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of <hi>Fact</hi> and the Practice of the Apoſtles: And it is a moſt genuine Deduction from the <hi>original Charter,</hi> given them by our Lord, that deſcribes their <hi>Work,</hi> in the <hi>ſuperior</hi> and <hi>main</hi> permanent branches of it, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes nothing expreſly but what is the allow'd &amp; undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Duty of ordinary <hi>Miniſters</hi> or <hi>Paſtors:</hi> which affords
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002636_0026_0FE5D75DD13CCFB0"/>
a ſtrong preſumptive Argument, that the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> in their ordinary and abiding Character, were really but <hi>Presbyters.</hi> Therefore all thoſe who are truly ordain'd to the Office of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> do ſucceed to the <hi>Apostles</hi> in the <hi>full Extent</hi> of their ordinary Capacity, and are to be look'd upon as inveſted with the Plenitude of their miniſterial and continuing Powers: One of which being <hi>Ordination,</hi> this neceſſary <hi>Inference</hi> plainly ariſes, and forceably urges our Aſſent, <hi>That Presbyters have the Ordaining Power committed to them,</hi> and lodg'd in their Hands, as <hi>their Peculiar,</hi> excluſively (in common Caſes at leaſt) of all others not rightly ordain'd to the Office of Presbyters, and ſo not truly ſuſtaining the ordinary Character of the Apoſtles.— Upon the whole then it appears, We offer no <hi>Injury</hi> at all to the Plea for <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi> Ordination, taken from <hi>the Laying on of the Hands of the Presbytery,</hi> although we allow this to refer to a Company of <hi>Apostles:</hi> Becauſe it muſt be granted, if they were Apoſtles, They ordain'd by virtue of their <hi>ordinary Power,</hi> which I've prov'd amounted to no more than that of <hi>Presbyters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>INDEED my <hi>Animadverter</hi> tells us, <hi>The Apostles were not only Presbyters, but</hi> Biſhops <hi>alſo in the full &amp; ſtricteſt Senſe of the Word.</hi> To which I reply; If he intends here the <hi>ſound</hi> Senſe of the Word, as us'd in <hi>Scripture,</hi> I have nothing to object. But, I think, invincible Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons lie in the way, if he intends the modern <hi>Eccleſiastical</hi> Senſe of the Word. For, <hi>thus</hi> taken, it is applicable to none but <hi>Dioceſan Prelates;</hi> whom the Animadverter deſcribes (<hi>pag.</hi> 10.) as thoſe that have in them <hi>the Power of Ordination, and Juriſdiction over a Plurality of Presbyters, and Churches, annexed,</hi> and <hi>are</hi> ſettled <hi>in their reſpective</hi> SEES. Now I deſire to know whether He will apply <hi>this</hi> Definition to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and ſo make them <hi>Biſhops</hi> in the <hi>full</hi> and <hi>stricteſt</hi> Senſe of the Word, as us'd by the <hi>Moderns.</hi> And after he has reſolv'd us on this head, I muſt give him the further Trouble of producing ſome good Evidence, that the <hi>modern Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Uſe</hi> of the Word is agreeable to the <hi>Scripture-Senſe</hi> of it: Becauſe for my own part, after my beſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:002636_0027_0FE5D7A2F602BC88"/>
I cannot light of any one place in all the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> where the word is us'd in the <hi>modern Prelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Senſe, to mean a Church-Officer veſted with <hi>Juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion over a Plurality of Churches and their Paſtors:</hi> but find it every where neceſſarily to be underſtood in the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Senſe, as convertible with the word <hi>Pastor, Teacher, Elder</hi> &amp;c. Yea, the Names of <hi>Biſhop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> are <hi>promiſcuouſly</hi> apply'd to the <hi>ſame Perſons,</hi> in ſeveral places: <hi>which</hi> Perſons do, by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of their Eſſential <hi>Qualifications,</hi> and by the <hi>Works</hi> and <hi>Offices</hi> aſſign'd 'em, in thoſe places, evidently appear to be the <hi>Paſtors</hi> and Overſeers of <hi>particular</hi> Congregations: As the <hi>Remarker</hi> has excellently argu'd; whoſe Reaſonings on theſe Heads are (I think) the moſt clear and ſtrong that I ever met with, and do make the <hi>Inference</hi> from a Community of <hi>Names</hi> (in this caſe) to an Identity of <hi>Office,</hi> and from the <hi>undistinguiſh'd</hi> Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the ſame <hi>Character</hi> and <hi>indifferent</hi> Injunctions of the ſame <hi>Work,</hi> unto the <hi>Sameneſs</hi> of <hi>Order,</hi> appear very good and genuine. And I preſume, neither the Light of his Arguings is obſcur'd, nor the Force of his Conſequences at all enervated, by any thing the <hi>Defender</hi> of the <hi>Mod. Proof</hi> has been able to offer.</p>
            <p>WE may then allow the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to be <hi>Biſhops,</hi> in the <hi>full</hi> and <hi>stricteſt</hi> Senſe of the Word, as us'd in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and yet our <hi>Animadverter</hi> gain no Advantage by it; becauſe that is but to allow 'em to be <hi>Presbyters:</hi> ſeeing <hi>Biſhop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> are in Scripture-Uſe <hi>Synoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>YEA, we may call 'em Biſhops in the <hi>modern Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical</hi> Senſe, as having <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> over <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Churches;</hi> and yet the <hi>Gentleman</hi> will gain nothing by it, to ſerve the Cauſe of <hi>Prelacy:</hi> becauſe ſuch a ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Power cou'd not belong to Them, in their <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> Capacity, <hi>merely</hi> as <hi>ſtated Commiſſion-Officers;</hi> but muſt be exerciſed by <hi>them</hi> in their <hi>extraordinary</hi> Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as <hi>Divinely inſpir'd</hi> Miniſters, under an <hi>infallible</hi> Conduct of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and endow'd with <hi>Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Powers.</hi> [Which I have ſaid enough to prove, both in the <hi>Appendix,</hi> and in this <hi>Vindication.</hi>] Therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho'

And indeed the Ordaining Power of <hi>Presbyters</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a great deal of Countenance from the Style of our Text, where this ſuppoſed College of Apoſtles are deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated a <hi>Presbytery,</hi> which plainly hints their acting (in <hi>Timothy's</hi> Ordination) under the Character and Quality of <hi>Presbyters.</hi> And however light any may make of an <hi>Inference,</hi> from the Uſe of that <hi>Phraſe,</hi> in favour of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination by <hi>Presbyters;</hi> yet (as I obſerv'd in the <hi>Appendix,</hi> pag. 19.) at leaſt there is ſo good <hi>Colour</hi> for ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that if it had been ſaid, <hi>By the Laying on of the Hands of the Aſſembly of</hi> Biſhops, I doubt not, our <hi>Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents</hi> would have made great Improvement of it, would have deem'd the Text <hi>Concluſive,</hi> and a full Confutation of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Hypotheſis. — But however that be, it is clear from the Premiſes, that our <hi>Animadverter</hi> muſt <hi>loſe his Point,</hi> even tho' we <hi>take him in his own way, by admitting his Comment on the Text, That</hi> Timothy <hi>was ordain'd by a College of Apoſtles:</hi> And if <hi>the Credit and the Evidence of the first Epiſtle to</hi> Tim. <hi>for Epiſcopacy,</hi> depends on this Text, <hi>that</hi> is loſt too.</p>
            <p>IN ſhort, let him conſider the Text in what Light he pleaſes; whether as referring to Apoſtles, or to ordinary Miniſters, he will never be able, by the moſt finiſh'd Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice in Logick he is Maſter of, to wreſt it to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; but either way it will be the Confuſion of his Cauſe.

            <p>LET us now hear what he offers, with reſpect to the <hi>other</hi> Conſtruction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>IF the Second,</hi> ſays he, (that is, if the word <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> be taken for a number of <hi>Pastors</hi> or Pariſh-Presbyters, then <hi>It is plain, that</hi> Paul <hi>alone conferred the Gift, that is, the Office and the Power of executing it, —and that the</hi> Presbyters <hi>only gave their Aſſent, it being impoſſible in the nature of the thing, that the</hi> Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>could have any other Influence on the Act.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT let it be obſerv'd here: The Gentleman has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got (what I intimated in the <hi>Appendix,</hi> and what many learned Men do agree to, <hi>viz.</hi>) That it's probable, <hi>Paul</hi>'s putting on of his Hands was not in <hi>Conjunction</hi> with the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> but at a <hi>diſtinct Time,</hi> and upon a different Deſign; his Impoſition of Hands being in order to the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt, and theirs for Ordination, and ſo might be at <hi>ſeveral</hi> Times. Or, as I hinted in the <hi>Appendix</hi> (p. 9.) They might both reſpect <hi>Ordination,</hi> and yet not be at the ſame Time; if our Opponents be in the Right on't about <hi>Re-ordination.</hi> For ſo, <hi>Timothy</hi> might be ordained firſt a <hi>Presbyter</hi> by the <hi>Presbytery</hi> alone, and afterwards a <hi>Biſhop</hi> by <hi>Paul.</hi> And if my Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter had given us his Thoughts on this, He would have much oblig'd us.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER, I will take the Gentleman in his <hi>own way,</hi> and will ſuppoſe them to be at the <hi>ſame Juncture,</hi> and upon the <hi>ſame Occaſion.</hi> Yet, I truſt, this will not any whit d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>AS to <hi>Paul's</hi> preſiding in <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Ordination, if this muſt be affirmed <hi>in either Caſe,</hi> as the Animadverter obſerves; I wou'd obſerve further, It muſt be own'd o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>equal</hi> weight in <hi>both Caſes,</hi> and ſo may as well be made uſe of in Objection to Ordination by <hi>Biſhops</hi> (the <hi>Apostles</hi> pretended Succeſſors) <hi>without a Superior,</hi> as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Ordination, by <hi>Presbyters,</hi> without a <hi>Superior.</hi> —
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:002636_0030_0FE59B59E629A740"/>
But, I think, <hi>Paul</hi>'s Preſidency in <hi>either</hi> Caſe, imported no more than the Power and Province of a <hi>Moderator,</hi> appointed for Order's ſake. In the <hi>firſt</hi> Caſe, or upon Suppoſition They were <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who joyned in Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of Hands, I am prone to believe my <hi>Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> will aſcribe nothing more to Him, ſeeing They <hi>all</hi> had an inherent Power of ordaining as well as he. And why <hi>any more</hi> ſhould be aſcribed to him in the <hi>other</hi> Caſe, or ſuppoſing them to be <hi>Presbyters,</hi> I cannot divine. For, that <hi>Paul</hi> lay'd on Hands (under his <hi>common</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) as a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and not under any <hi>diſtinctive</hi> Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as a <hi>ſuperior</hi> Officer, or <hi>Head,</hi> is a Conſequence very fairly deducible from the choſen <hi>Style</hi> of the Text; where he ſpeaks of the whole Conſiſtory of Ordainers, as a <hi>Presbytery,</hi> taking in <hi>Himſelf</hi> among the Reſt, without any mark of <hi>Diſtinction:</hi> which, as it carries with it an Intimation, that <hi>all</hi> the Members of the Body had a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Agency</hi> in the Ordination; So it naturally leads us to infer, That <hi>Paul</hi> exerted no more <hi>ordaining</hi> Power than any common Member, and had not the Influence of a ſupreme <hi>Head,</hi> as ſome vainly dream. And indeed, if I miſtake not, the fix'd notion of a <hi>Preſident</hi> (the Name, my Animadverter applies to the Apoſtle in this Caſe) can carry his Power to no higher a pitch than that of a <hi>Moderator,</hi> who (as I hinted before) is conſtituted only for <hi>order's</hi> ſake, and has no more intrinſick Power than any others belonging to the Society.</p>
            <p>I might illuſtrate this to our Animadverter, by the <hi>Conſecration</hi> of a <hi>Biſhop</hi> in his own Church: in which the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> preſides, but yet is only the <hi>Mouth</hi> of the Aſſembly, and has no more authoritative Influence into the Ordination (by any ſuperior Degree of ordaining Power inherent in him) than the Reſt of his <hi>Fellow-Biſhops,</hi> that joyn with him in the Action; as appears by the <hi>Form</hi> of Conſecration of Biſhops, and in that the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> claims no Superiority of <hi>order</hi> to other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, nor indeed any ſuperior <hi>Degree</hi> of Power, as of <hi>Divine Right,</hi> but as ariſing only out of Eccleſiaſtical and Civil Laws and Cuſtoms. And hence, in <hi>that Caſe,</hi> the Practice of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is exactly agreeable to the Practice of the Churches of <hi>New England,</hi> in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002636_0031_0FE5D7A87B91F060"/>
of a Miniſter; in which we have a <hi>Moderator</hi> to preſide, who is of the ſame Claſs with the other Paſtors.</p>
            <p>SO that <hi>Paul</hi>'s Preſidency in <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Ordination, can afford our Opponents nothing of an Argument to plead againſt <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Ordinations. And truly (to borrow a Hint from the <hi>Remarker</hi>) <q>That gives us no more grounds to ſuſpect that the <hi>Presbyters</hi> had not full power and authority to ordain <hi>by themſelves,</hi> than it does to ſuſpect whether the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> had power to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain by himſelf.</q> At leaſt it can be no more an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt Ordination by <hi>Presbyters</hi> alone (without Biſhops) than by <hi>Biſhops</hi> alone, without Presbyters. And yet how conſtantly is this practiced in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in all Conſecrations to the <hi>Epiſcopate!</hi> Here only the <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi> and <hi>Biſhops preſent,</hi> are concern'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no meer <hi>Presbyters</hi> are admitted to joyn.

               </gap>eable this, to <hi>Scripture Example,</hi> in the Conſecration of <hi>Timothy,</hi> the ſuppoſed Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus?</hi> Indeed my Animadverter obſerves, if they were <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who laid their hands with <hi>Paul</hi>'s on <hi>Timothy,</hi> this <hi>will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly agreeable to the Church of</hi> England.— But then, he has been ſo uncautious, as nor to offer one ſingle word in proof, that they were <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> nor indeed has he ſo much as aſſerted it: but ſeems willing to allow, they were only <hi>Presbyters;</hi> as I had argu'd, and I think, prov'd. Hence he has left the way open for one or other of thoſe <hi>Conſequences</hi> to take place, that I have purſu'd his Friend with (in my <hi>Appendix,</hi> p. 10, 11) either of which, I think, grate hard enough on him. Tho' I imagin he judges the laſt to be the moſt harmleſs, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Church of <hi>England</hi> has departed from <hi>Scripture-Pattern,</hi> in excluding <hi>Presbyters</hi> from laying on hands in the Ordination of <hi>Biſhops;</hi> whence her Prelates muſt be own'd not <hi>Regularly</hi> conſecrated; and ſo far at leaſt She muſt look <hi>uncanonical</hi> &amp; <hi>unprimitive,</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her boaſted Apoſtolic Conſtitution.</p>

            <p>IT is plain, the <hi>Ordainers</hi> do not <hi>confer</hi> the Power, but only <hi>confirm,</hi> approve, inveſt, and the like. They are at moſt but Inſtruments of Conveyance, or rather of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation</hi> and publick Inſtallment.

               </hi> the <hi>King</hi> does not derive the <hi>Regal Authority</hi> from <hi>Him</hi> in the leaſt.

So the <hi>Mayor</hi> of a City derives all his Power from the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Charter, and not at all from the <hi>Recorder</hi> or <hi>Steward,</hi> who performs the Ceremony of Inauguration. Which Things may very, much help to adjuſt and ſettle our Notions of Eccleſiaſtical <hi>Ordination:</hi> And we may call it a public <hi>Recognition,</hi> and Atteſtation, or ſolemn Inauguration and Inveſtiture.</p>

Which perhaps they might inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently enough do, it it may be uſed at all for that end. Methinks, had the Presbyters been mere <hi>Conſenters,</hi> an audible <hi>Amen</hi> at the cloſe of the <hi>Apostle</hi>'s Prayer, or <hi>giving the Right Hand</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> after his Ordination, would have ſufficiently anſwer'd the End, without their <hi>Laying on Hands</hi> with <hi>Paul,</hi> which (beſides the needleſs Trouble to them) would be likely to prove a Snare in future times, by leading <hi>Presbyters</hi> into bold Pretences under Colour of a primitive Example. Hence we may well think the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> (that wiſe Maſter-Builder) would not have allow'd the <hi>Presbyters</hi> to join with him in Impoſition of Hands, unleſs they had been really veſted with the Power of Ordination, as well as he:—Agreeable to what I ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted in the <hi>Appendix,</hi> (pag. 11, 12.) tho' my <hi>Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> has not thought it worth his Notice. Neither has he made any Remarks on my 13th <hi>page,</hi> where I have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued upon his own Hypotheſis of <hi>Paul</hi>'s being the <hi>ſole Ordainer</hi> (in Excluſion of the <hi>Presbytery</hi>) That never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs this Text will not ſerve the Cauſe of <hi>Prelacy:</hi> Becauſe that from an <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s, to a <hi>Biſhop</hi>'s, aſſuming the whole Power in Ordination (excluſive of the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> impoſing Hands with him) there is no rational Inference, not ſo much as the face of one; Since Biſhops pretend not to ſucceed the Apoſtles in any other than their <hi>ordinary</hi> Capacity (in which alſo Presbyters do equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſucceed them) and <hi>Paul</hi> cannot reaſonably be ſuppoſed to have ordain'd in <hi>that</hi> Capacity, if the whole Virtue of the Act lay in the Touch of <hi>his</hi> Hand.—I muſt not enlarge

                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 13, 22, 23, 25, 29 &amp;c.</note>, and I doubt not you may gather up very convincing Proofs, to ſupport this Argument.</p>
            <p>BUT to bring the Diſpute to an Iſſue; if we ſhould let all the foregoing Arguments paſs for nothing, yet one thing I have to add, that muſt needs ſilence my Animid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter: I mean the <hi>declared Senſe</hi> of his <hi>own Church,</hi> which we ſhall find to be full <hi>againſt</hi> Him, if we conſult the <hi>Form of Ordination of Prieſts.</hi> For thus run the Words at the laying on of the Hands of the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and the <hi>Priests</hi> preſent — <hi>Receive the Holy Ghoſt for the Office and Work of a Prieſt in the Church of God, new committed unto Thee by the Impoſition of</hi> OUR <hi>Hands.</hi> — You ſee there is a <hi>Plurality</hi> of Ordainers, and the <hi>Presbyters</hi> are aſſociated with the <hi>Biſhop</hi> in the Action, as laying on their Hands for the <hi>ſame End,</hi> without any Diſtinction. So that the <hi>Church of England</hi> her ſelf looks on the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> joyning with the Biſhop in laying on of Hands, as being active or influential in the ſacred <hi>Inveſtiture;</hi> owns their ordaining Power, and doth not make their Concurrence with the Biſhop ſuch an inſignificant <hi>Cypher,</hi> ſuch an impertinent Ceremony, as our <hi>Animadverter</hi>'s Principles infer it to be. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not then but look upon this Gentleman as flying in the face of his <hi>Mother</hi> the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nys the ordaining Power of Presbyters; and as loading his <hi>Fathers,</hi> the Biſhops, with the Imputation of a grand Abſurdity, in their ſaying to the Prieſt ordained, —<hi>Receive the Holy Ghoſt for the Work now committed to Thee by the Impoſition of</hi> OUR <hi>Hands;</hi> — when he aſſerts it to be <hi>impoſſible,</hi> in the Nature of the Thing, for a <hi>Plurality</hi> to have a joynt Intereſt or Inſtrumentality in the miniſterial Conveyance of the Prieſts Office. And how his <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Brethren will reliſh it, I do not know: but this I know, That they have <hi>just Grounds</hi> to reſent it, as a very groſs affront offer'd 'em by him, in thus put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſuch a contemptuous Interpretation upon their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence with the Biſhop, as if it were a needleſs and
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:002636_0041_0FE5D7414C5FBD68"/>
empty <hi>Formality,</hi> and of no real Significancy, as to the matter of Ordination, any more than if a number of <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons</hi> joyn'd, or than it ſo many mere <hi>Laymen</hi> put on their unhallow'd Hands. — And now I leave him to the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> of his Brethren; who, if they ſhould take him to Task, would perhaps uſe him with greater <hi>Soverity</hi> than I care at preſent to do. — But here let my Defenſe of the <hi>firſt Text</hi> conclude: which, tho' it may have been longer than was <hi>neceſſary;</hi> yet, I hope, not longer than will be <hi>profitable.</hi> What remains, ſhall be ſtudiouſly drawn into a narrower Compaſs.</p>
            <p>§ 2. I proceed now to the Vindication of the <hi>ſecond Text,</hi> viz. <hi>Acts</hi> 13. <hi>begin.</hi> Where we find <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> ſeparated to their Miniſtry among the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> by the Hands of certain <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> at <hi>Antioch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW I took theſe Men to be <hi>Presbyters;</hi> and laid it down, That <hi>we have h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>re an Inſtance of Ordination by ſuch as were neither Apoſtles nor Dioceſans.</hi> But I did not ſtand to <hi>prove</hi> their Character, becauſe I thought there was enough obſerv'd in the <hi>Sob. Remarks</hi> (pag. 116. <hi>Edit.</hi> 2.) to which my Performance was deſign'd as an <hi>Appendix;</hi> Enough, I ſay, to prevent all Cavils upon that head, from any one that ſhould undertake a proper Defenſe of the <hi>Mod. Proof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT the <hi>Animadverter</hi> blows upon my Notion, and won't allow me the Suppoſition. He tells us, <hi>The Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appears plainly falſe:</hi> While yet he has been able to bring no better Evidence, than a bare Conjecture [pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his own too] which at beſt can only conclude it <hi>poſſible</hi> to be ſo. And he ſays <hi>he cannot believe us, when the Aſſertion appears plainly falſe.</hi> Truly he muſt be one of a very <hi>odd</hi> Make, if he <hi>cou'd:</hi> very few in the World have attained to <hi>believe</hi> what <hi>appears</hi> to 'em <hi>plainly falſe.</hi> All that <hi>we</hi> deſire, is, that he would believe us, when the Aſſertion appears plainly <hi>true:</hi> As I hope it will <hi>in the preſent Caſe,</hi> after I have conſider'd the Proof he
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:002636_0042_0FE5D7C3392787E0"/>
brings to make it appear falſe. Which we have in theſe Words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> — <hi>For in that Text we find Perſons there of a ſuperiour Character to meer</hi> Presbyters, <hi>and yet only there ſaid to be</hi> Prophets <hi>and</hi> Teachers; <hi>for it's certain</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas <hi>were</hi> Apoſtles, <hi>and as ſuch of a ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Character to meer</hi> Presbyters, <hi>and no Reaſon can be given to question it in the others, for</hi> Biſhops <hi>not being always mention'd under the Title of their higheſt Office and Order, it will not follow, that tho' ſometimes named under the Character of their lowest Order, that they have no higher; and therefore it will follow, that if</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas <hi>were (notwithſtanding their being called there</hi> Prophets <hi>and</hi> Teachers) <hi>really</hi> Apoſtles <hi>or</hi> Biſhops, <hi>that the others were alſo really ſuch, tho' with them alſo mentioned under inferiour Characters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have ſet down his Argument here at length, that you may ſee the whole Force it carrys in Bar to my Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of thoſe Ordainers: And I muſt confeſs, if he had not put his Concluſion in ſuch <hi>strong</hi> Terms (but inſtead of <hi>really were,</hi> had ſaid, <hi>might be</hi>) it would have been the moſt handſom <hi>Evaſion</hi> that I ever met with on this head. But that it is <hi>only</hi> an Evaſion, a thin Sophiſm, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains nothing of ſolid Reaſon, I hope will (upon a cool debate of the Matter) appear, even to <hi>his own</hi> impartial Reflections. Here then to put it in it's genuine Light,</p>
            <p n="1">1. LET us try how <hi>this way</hi> of Reaſoning will hold in <hi>other Caſes</hi> of the <hi>like Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FOR Inſtance; Suppoſe the Government of the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> (which I particularly mention, for a good Reaſon) were ſpoken of, and their Names ſet down in ſome public Records; — but all under the common Style of <hi>Magistrates</hi> and <hi>Rulers:</hi> Would our Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter now, becauſe he finds a <hi>Governour</hi> and <hi>Deputy-Governour</hi> among Them, hence conclude them <hi>all</hi> to be of ſuch ſuperior Characters? How abſurd! How ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous!</p>
            <p>BUT a Scripture-Inſtance may perhaps be more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. We have one in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. Where we find <hi>Paul</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:002636_0043_0FE5D7420FB61840"/>
and <hi>Apollos</hi> ſpoken of together under the general Name of <hi>Miniſters.</hi> Now <hi>it is certain,</hi> Paul <hi>was an</hi> Apoſtle, <hi>and as ſuch of a ſuperior Character to a meer</hi> Presbyter; <hi>and yet is only ſaid there to be a</hi> Miniſter. But will my Animadverter add in this Caſe. — <hi>and no Reaſon can be given to queſtion it in the other Perſon, though with him alſo mentioned under an inferior Character!</hi> I hope he won't. For <hi>ſo</hi> he'll daſh againſt the <hi>Modeſt Proof,</hi> which calls <hi>Apollo</hi> but a <hi>Pastor,</hi> and ranks him among thoſe of the <hi>inferior Order</hi> (Pag. 29, 30.) Unleſs then he will contend here with that <hi>Modest Gentleman</hi> (as he calls him) he muſt own I've brought a parallel Caſe, in which his way of arguing is very lame and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſequential. — But I may mention another Inſtance we have in <hi>Acts</hi> 15, which is ſtill more clear &amp; parallel, if it be poſſible. We there read, that <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas,</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were at <hi>Antioch</hi> together; and they are all called <hi>Prophets.</hi> Compare <hi>ver.</hi> 30. &amp; 32. —This new comes up full to our Text.

               </gap> For altho' <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were Apoſtles; yet the <hi>other two</hi> were not ſo.

But if this doth not ſatisfy, I hope the Opinion of the Author of <hi>Modest Proof</hi> will: Where we find <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> by Name, ſpoken of as <hi>Two Presbyters,</hi> and called merely <hi>Miniſters of the Word and Sacraments,</hi> and rank'd in <hi>the Order of the Seventy;</hi> ſaid to be <hi>of a diſtinct Office and Order, and inferior to that of the Apoſtles.</hi> (Page 14. &amp; 38.)</p>
            <p>THESE Inſtances may ſuffice to ſhew how <hi>precarious,</hi> how <hi>ambiguous,</hi> and <hi>illogical,</hi> the Animadverter's way of arguing is; ſince it will by no means hold, when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to other Caſes of the like Nature. But we muſt excuſe him; for he has uſed the <hi>beſt Shift</hi> he cou'd fine

            <p>AND now I might very fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ly withdraw my Hand, and give over the Conſideration of this Text. For, the Buſineſs of <hi>Proof</hi> here is incumbent on my <hi>Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> he being upon the <hi>Affirmative</hi> Side, And ſince he has not been able to prove his <hi>Aſſertion,</hi> my <hi>Negative</hi> ſtands good, and he can't reaſonably expect I ſhould labor in the Proof of it. However left my Silence here ſhould be miſinterpreted, I will not decline the Task: for I don't deſpair of Succeſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THEN, let us ſee if we can't <hi>make it out,</hi> by ſome clear and pregnant Proofs, that the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> who ſeparated <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> were not <hi>Apoſtles</hi> nor <hi>Dioceſans.</hi> This, I think, will appear very plain, and we ſhall find enough to convince every impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Inquirer, if we conſider the Style of the <hi>Text,</hi> or if we look into the <hi>Context.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) LET us conſider the Language of the <hi>Text,</hi> which runs thus,—<hi>Now there were in the Church that was at Antioch, certain Prophets &amp; Teachers.</hi> In the Original it is— <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: —which is capable of various Tranſlations, &amp; all accommodable to my purpoſe. I ſhall not trouble you with all the different Readings, but will ſingle out two eminent Expoſitors among the <hi>Animadverter's</hi> own Brethren, to give us the Critical Lection, I mean, Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Whitby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>H.</hi> ſo renders it,— <hi>Now there were Some in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch.</hi> BELONGING <hi>to the Church that then was, Prophets and Doctors.</hi> — That is, <hi>that then was at Antioch,</hi> as I think the Rules of Conſtruction do oblige us to explain it: altho' the <hi>Doctor</hi> in his Paraphraſe ſtretches the Senſe, and takes in <hi>the Churches of</hi> Syria <hi>of that Age,</hi> of which he ſuppoſes thoſe Prophets and Teachers to be <hi>Biſhops.</hi> Which is a Conſtruction I can't deviſe what ſhou'd lead him into, but an odd Notion he was ſo fond of, as if <hi>Every City had a Biſhop, and cou'd have no
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:002636_0045_0FE5D7C4DDA1FBB8"/>
more than one.</hi> But I think, <hi>His critical Note,</hi> as I have explain'd it, is preferrable to <hi>his Paraphraſe,</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries abundantly more rational Probability with it. For obſerve, among thoſe Prophets and Teachers we find <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Barnabas,</hi> who cannot with any colour of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be called <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Syria.</hi> And then the phraſe of the Text is ſuch as ſpeaks it to be a <hi>particular Church,</hi> that thoſe Perſons are ſaid to belong unto. For it is, <hi>the Church,</hi> in the ſingular number; a particular Church; and muſt (by the moſt eaſy &amp; natural Interpretation) mean the Church at <hi>Antioch,</hi> which is mentioned immediately before. Whereas, when <hi>Provinces</hi> and <hi>Countries</hi> are referr'd to, the <hi>Plural</hi> Number is us'd. So we read of <hi>the Churches of</hi> Judea, <hi>the Churches of</hi> Aſia, <hi>the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of</hi> Galatia <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore it is very unlikely that the Apoſtle ſhould refer to the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Syria,</hi> in our Text. But by comparing this with other places of the like Importance, the Caſe will appear plainer. Thus, 1 Cor. 1.2. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>—. So in 2 Cor. 1.1 we have the ſame Words repeated. Which are by the Doctor without any difficulty tranſlated. <hi>To the Church which is at Corinth.</hi> And why by <hi>the Church</hi> in our Text we ſhould not underſtand, <hi>The Church which is at Antioch,</hi> (notwithſtanding a little Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the words in our Text) I know of no ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Reaſon. For ought I can ſee, the Text may very well be read thus.— <hi>Now there were certain Prophets and Teachers belonging to the Church, that was in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch;</hi> or, <hi>There were Teachers in</hi> Antioch, <hi>belonging to the Church then being,</hi> in that City. I may here allude to ſome of my Animadverter's Expreſſions (in another place <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Def.</hi> p. 35.</note>) and ſay;—<hi>The Senſe will not ſuffer at all by this Tranſlation; There is nothing in the Original that hinders its being exactly ſo rendered; unleſs it be the Cauſe of Epiſcopacy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND correſpondent to my Reading is that of Dr. <hi>Whitby,</hi> who ſo tranſlates it,—<hi>There were ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Teachers in Antioch belonging to that Church.</hi> And he vouch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:002636_0046_0FE5D7C5A2F50D08"/>IT appears then, in the Judgment of theſe great Men, that the <hi>Church</hi> ſpoken of was that at <hi>Antioch;</hi> and it is agreed to by Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> that (whatever the Church was) <hi>Theſe Prophets &amp; Teachers did</hi> BELONG <hi>unto it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW it is a fix'd and invariable Maxim, in our Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents Scheme,— <hi>But one Biſhop in a Church.</hi>—Whereas, here is a <hi>Number</hi> of Teachers, belonging to <hi>one</hi> and the ſame Church. Therefore they could not be Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan <hi>Biſhops.</hi> And that they were not in the ſtrict Senſe <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or of equal Figure with <hi>Paul,</hi> the inſpired Doctor of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> I believe my Animadverter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (upon his recollected Thoughts) will readily allow me. Surely he can have no Temptation to ſuppoſe them <hi>Apoſtles</hi> or <hi>Prelates,</hi> ſave that he finds them <hi>laying on of Hands:</hi> but this carries no Print at all of either Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; becauſe it is an Action we find performed by <hi>Presbyters</hi> (as I have ſhewn before) in the Ordination of <hi>Timothy,</hi> &amp; in the Ordinations of his own Church.</p>
            <p>BUT here enters in upon me an Objection, that ſeems to lie againſt the Conſtruction of our Text, given above, making thoſe <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> to <hi>belong</hi> unto the Church at <hi>Antioch:</hi> And we may imagin our Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter to be laying it down thus,—</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>WELL but</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas <hi>were among thoſe</hi> Prophets <hi>and</hi> Teachers. <hi>And they cannot be ſaid to</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long <hi>to that Church, becauſe</hi> Apoſtles: <hi>And therefore it will follow that no more did the others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer,</p>
            <p>THAT, ſince the <hi>greater Part</hi> belong'd to that Church, it makes no ſuch Alteration, as to hurt my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, altho' we ſhould allow an <hi>Exception</hi> of <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> out of the Number. <hi>Paul</hi> was an Apoſtle, and was ſo at that time, I confeſs. But that <hi>Barnabas</hi> was an Apoſtle <hi>before</hi> his going with <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> upon the Miſſion our Text relates to, I never yet could ſee any ſufficient Evidence. My Animadverter's Party indeed affirm it: <hi>but has he, or they, prov'd it? No,</hi> (if I may borrow ſome of his own pretty Turns here) <hi>That is an
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:002636_0047_0FE5D742D3F77B10"/>
unuſual method with the Writers on that Side; however, we cannot believe them, when the Aſſertion appears plainly falſe as it does in this Caſe.</hi> For before that Miſſion, we don't hear of <hi>Barnabas</hi>'s doing any thing more than the common Work of a <hi>Preacher.</hi> In the laſt Account we have of him, before that in our Text, we find the CHURCH <hi>at Jeruſalem</hi> SENDING <hi>him forth, that he ſhould go as fat as Antioch: who when he came there,</hi> exported <hi>them all; — for he was a good Man</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Then,</hi> after he had preached to them awhile with good Succeſs, <hi>he departed to Tarſus for to ſeek</hi> Saul; <hi>and when he had found him, he brought him unto</hi> Antioch. (<hi>Acts</hi> 11.22 <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) Now for the <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of this, I will refer my Animadverter to one of his own Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren (Dr. <hi>Whitby</hi>) whoſe Paraphraſe on the place runs thus, — <q>
                  <hi>Then departed Barnabas</hi> (from Antioch) <hi>to Tarſus, to ſeek</hi> Saul, (perhaps that he being an <hi>Apoſtle</hi> might lay his Hands on ſome of them, that they might receive the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> Acts 8.17.) <hi>And when he had found him</hi> &amp;c.</q> — Here we have this learned Prelatiſt hinting his Opinion, that <hi>Barnabas</hi> at that time was <hi>not</hi> an <hi>Apoſtle.</hi> And if ſo, then only <hi>Saul</hi> is left, appearing to be of that Character: and he is mention'd laſt. <hi>Barnabas</hi> begins the Catalogue: and <hi>Saul</hi> finiſhes it, who might be placed <hi>after</hi> all, becauſe (<hi>He</hi> being an <hi>Apostle,</hi> and <hi>They</hi> only <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi>) they did more ſtrictly and properly <hi>belong</hi> to the Church at <hi>Antioch,</hi> than He. However, I am willing for the preſent to humour the matter, &amp; take my Antagoniſt in his own way, by admitting <hi>Barnabas</hi> to be an <hi>Apostle,</hi> before the Miſſion our Text relates to: which will make two of the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> ſpoken of, <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> Nevertheleſs the <hi>greater</hi> Number ſtill remains, who in a ſtrict Senſe belong'd to that Church, as the ordinary Teachers of it. And on <hi>that</hi> Account, <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> might be mention'd under the Character they ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in <hi>common</hi> with Them: according to the known and allow'd Practice of Men, in the like Caſes, who uſe to denominate the <hi>whole,</hi> from the <hi>Majority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND then, if we reflect a little, we ſhall find occaſion to think it no ſuch Abſurdity, tho' we reckon
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:002636_0048_0FE5D7CC8CC98B58"/>
               <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> among the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> AS belonging then to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Antioch.</hi> Let us hear Dr. <hi>Whitby</hi>'s Thoughts upon the Propriety of it, who thus vindicates his Reading of the Place, (which, as I told you before, is) —<hi>There were ſome Prophets and Teachers in Antioch, belonging to that Church.</hi> He notes, — <q>And indeed <hi>Barnabas</hi> &amp; <hi>Paul</hi> might well be reckon'd ſuch; <hi>Barnabas</hi> being ſent thither by the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (Chap. 11.22.) and <hi>He</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> preaching there a <hi>whole Year</hi> (ver. 26<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent by <hi>that Church</hi> to Jeruſalem, with their Alms. (<hi>ver.</hi> 30.) — And it is to be obſerved, when they had compleated their temporary Miſſion to preach to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> (that being the Work to which they were called, <hi>ver.</hi> 2.) they then return'd to <hi>Antioch,</hi> and gave an Account of it to the Church there, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what they had done in Proſecution of it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.26, 27.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THESE Conſiderations, the learned <hi>Doctor</hi> judg'd to be a full Vindication of <hi>his Reading;</hi> and do ſufficiently ſhow us, that it carries in it <hi>no ſuch Impropriety</hi> of Speech (as at firſt view one might be apt to imagine) altho' according to it, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> be reckon'd among the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> ſaid to <hi>belong</hi> to the Church of <hi>Antioch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>NOW to ſum up the Evidence:</hi> ſince the Whole might be <hi>denominated</hi> from the <hi>Major</hi> Part, and eſpecially ſince <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> might well enough be ſaid (in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) to belong to the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> at that time; it follows that <hi>their</hi> being <hi>Apoſtles</hi> can be no forceable Plea in Bar to the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Reading, nor to my Argument grounded upon it. And thus we ſee, by a little Attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Words of the <hi>Text,</hi> that thoſe who ſeparated <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> were neither <hi>Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ceſans</hi> nor <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> But further to ſtrengthen the Argument,</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) LET us take a View of the <hi>Context;</hi> and ſee if we can't trace their Original, and fix their Character, by <hi>comparing</hi> Things a little.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="unknown:002636_0049_0FE5D7CD765DEC48"/>IF we look back to <hi>Act.</hi> 8.1. we ſhall read of <hi>a great Perſecution</hi> of the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> by which They were all ſcattered abroad, <hi>except the Apoſtles.</hi> And then in <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.19. we have this account, That <hi>they which were ſcattered abroad, travelled as far as</hi> — Ant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>och, <hi>preaching the Word</hi>—. Now, if we throw together a few Circumſtances, it will appear highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that the <hi>Miniſters,</hi> who ſeparated <hi>Paul &amp; Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas,</hi> were ſome of theſe diſperſed Diſciples. For we find, by <hi>Act.</hi> 11.20. That <hi>Some of them which came down to</hi> Antioch, <hi>were Men</hi> originally <hi>of Cyrene.</hi> And in our Text, <hi>Lucius</hi> (one of the Ordainers) is expreſly ſaid to be a <hi>Cyrenean.</hi> Dr. <hi>Whitby</hi> therefore, by a very juſt &amp; eaſy Conſequence, poſitively concludes <hi>him</hi> to be one of thoſe <hi>that then came down to Antioch.</hi> And as to <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> he vouches <hi>Epiphanius</hi> for <hi>his</hi> being one of the <hi>Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> and ſo probably one of the <hi>Diſperſed</hi> from <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> who are ſaid to travel as far as <hi>Antioch,</hi> preaching the Word; ſome of whom were Men of <hi>Cyprus:</hi> and accordingly Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> conceives this <hi>Niger</hi> to be a <hi>Cypriot.</hi> Finally, as to <hi>Manaen,</hi> our Text tells us, <hi>he was brought up with</hi> Herod <hi>the Tetrarch,</hi> bred at Court: but turning Chriſtian, he was perſecuted with the Reſt; and it's likely was one of thoſe that were <hi>ſcatter'd abroad</hi> by the Perſecution.— Thus I have reduced it to a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Certainty, or rational Probability, that the <hi>three Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainers</hi> were ſome of the <hi>Diſperſion:</hi> and I think it needs no further Scrutiny, to diſcover, that they were neither <hi>Prelates</hi> nor <hi>Apostles,</hi> but Paſtors &amp; Miniſters of the Word. — This may ſuffice for the Confirmation of my Point: and let not my <hi>Animadverter</hi> complain again, for want of <hi>Proof</hi> on our ſide; until he is able to produce as probable Evidence in favour of his <hi>own</hi> Aſſertion.</p>
            <p>BUT perhaps he may ſtart an Objection here &amp; ſay,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>WHAT tho' it be granted they were of thoſe that were diſperſed, and at that time were but Presbyters! Yet this argues nothing; becauſe they might afterwards be advanced to the Epiſcopate.</hi>

               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:002636_0050_0FE59B486BD40438"/>TO which I reply; —</p>
            <p>THAT they could not <hi>all</hi> be Dioceſan Biſhops, I have prov'd before, when I obſerv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, that They all <hi>belong'd</hi> to the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and that our Opponents Scheme allows of but <hi>one Biſhop in a Church</hi> at the ſame time, And now,—</p>
            <p>THAT <hi>not ſo much as one</hi> of them was a Biſhop (of ſuch a Stamp) I hope will appear to every one's Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, upon a conſiderate View of two things. Let us,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Reflect on the forecited Story <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 11.22 &amp;c.</note> of <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas.</hi> We are told, <hi>the Church which was in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>ſent forth</hi> Barnabas, <hi>that he ſhould go as far as</hi> Antioch: <hi>who when he came,— exhorted them all</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Then departed</hi> Barnabas <hi>to</hi> Tarſus <hi>for to ſeek</hi> Saul: <hi>and when he had found him, he brought him unto</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch.—But now what <hi>Need</hi> of this, if there were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready at <hi>Antioch,</hi> either Apoſtles, or a Prelate? Obſerve it, I have before produced ſuch Conſiderations, as carry in them a good force of Argument, that <hi>They</hi> who ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> were of the Number of thoſe who were ſcattered abroad by the Perſection at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and who then went down to <hi>Antioch;</hi> preaching the Word there: and that therefore at that time they were but <hi>Presbyters.</hi> And now that they were not any of them advanced to the <hi>Apostolate</hi> or the <hi>Epiſcopate,</hi> when <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> went to <hi>Antioch,</hi> ſeems a rational Concluſion; for that otherwiſe <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi>'s going thither muſt have been needleſs, as to any thing that peculiarly concern'd the Work of an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> or the Office of a <hi>Biſhop.</hi> But whatever may be the Strength of this Plea, in Objection to my <hi>Animadverter</hi>'s precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Hypotheſis: let me add,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I am ſure, In the whole Affair of <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi>'s Miſſion, there is not the leaſt Intimation of any thing that carrys even the Shadow of <hi>Prelacy;</hi> no Hint of any one that had the Supremacy over the Reſt. The Direction runs in the <hi>Plural</hi> Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] The Addreſs is to a collective Body of Presbyters, and not to a ſingle Prelate, — And the Tranſaction was manag'd by a <hi>Plurality,</hi> a Triumvirate. THEY <hi>faſted and prayed and laid on Hands:</hi> And THEY <hi>ſent them away.</hi> And it is obſervable, when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> returned to <hi>Antioch</hi> (from whence they had been recommended to the Grace of God, for the Work which they had fulfilled; as we have the Report, <hi>Acts.</hi> 14.26, 27.) <hi>They gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Church together,</hi> and <hi>rehearſed all that God had done with them</hi> — They gave this Account, not to the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> (as it might have been expected, had there been one there) nor to the <hi>Apostles,</hi> (as <hi>Barnabas</hi> had done at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in another Caſe before. <hi>Acts</hi> 9.27.) but to the <hi>Church,</hi> comprehending both Officers, and Members. — So that there is not the leaſt Ink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a <hi>Prelatical</hi> or <hi>Apostolical</hi> Character upon any of thoſe that ſeparated <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>UPON the whole then it may very rationally be infer'd, <hi>We have here an Inſtance of</hi> Presbyters <hi>ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and that without the Preſidency of any</hi> Superiour, <hi>whether Apoſtle, or Dioceſan Biſhop:</hi> which was the Propoſition my Animadverter charg'd with want of Proof. But I believe he'l find no Grounds to complain again on this head. For I ſuppoſe my point now pretty well prov'd. And if ſo, then of Conſequence, that <hi>great Queſtion</hi> is decided, in favour of <hi>my</hi> Cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the Power of Ordination was originally annexed to the Government of <hi>Prelates,</hi> in oppoſition to that of <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters?</hi> The <hi>Diſcuſſion whereof</hi> (our Anſwerer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves <note n="†" place="bottom">

For I dare appeal to any one, who is not bias'd by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to ſerve an <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> whether I have not ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prov'd my Point, and ſet it in a very unexceptionable Light. My Antagoniſt himſelf, I think, muſt needs own he was under a miſtake, at leaſt, in ſaying, That if Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas <hi>were (notwithſtanding their being called

In Points of ſo great Conſequence, we muſt go upon certain Facts, and not upon mere Conjecture, ſupported by no Reaſon</hi> or Evidence. <hi>And when nothing of this Nature appears, it is intolerable Boldneſs to conclude confidently.</hi> — Very juſt Obſervations! Wou'd he had acted always up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own Rules! But happy and rare is the Man that condemneth not himſelf, one way or other, in that thing which he alloweth. I hope he will take Care, the next time he writes, to bring ſome poſitive Proofs of his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion; or elſe my negative Arguments (at leaſt without a ſolid Refutation) muſt needs, in the Judgment of the impartial World, remain of Force againſt him: and ſo he will lie open to a too juſt Imputation of what he calls the <hi>Remarker's</hi> Iniquity, <hi>Adding to the Scripture, and creating Apoſtles at his pleaſure.</hi> I ſhall ſecurely wait his Anſwer: and haſten now in the laſt place to conſider —</p>
            <p>§. 3. THE <hi>other Text</hi> he has attempted to ſet in a <hi>true Light,</hi> viz. 1 Tim. 5.17. <hi>Let the Elders that rule well, be counted worthy of double Honour;</hi> Eſpecially <hi>they who labour in the Word and Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A large Stride, you may obſerve it is, my Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter here takes; there being above a <hi>dozen</hi> pages, between the other Text and this, which have entirely eſcap'd his
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:002636_0053_0FE5D7D8DB5DB8D8"/>
Remarks: altho' ſome things are there ſaid, which bear pretty hard upon the Author, and the Cauſe, he has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to defend, and nothing he has offer'd any where (either in his <hi>Defence,</hi> or in his <hi>Animadverſions</hi>) that I can diſcern, will poſſibly ſerve for a Reply. However the Gentleman skips over all (for what Reaſon, I can't tell; unleſs it were, becauſe he ſaw ſuch Difficulties thrown in his way, as he deſpair'd of ever being able to grapple with) and by one great and ſudden Leap, comes to a <hi>Text,</hi> which, though I laid ſome Streſs upon it, yet belong'd not to the main Argument, but was brought in only <hi>occaſionally,</hi> in arguing upon an <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> that I did not actually <hi>grant</hi> my Author, though I was willing for once to take him in his own way.</p>
            <p>THE Deſign, upon which I uſed this Text, was to prove, that <hi>Teaching</hi> is a more honorable Office than <hi>Ruling:</hi> and that therefore, admitting <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> to be two diſtinct Orders, yet <hi>Biſhops</hi> are not <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior</hi> to them. And here after ſeveral Hints pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, I came to argue from the <hi>Diſtinction</hi> which the Apoſtle (in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17.) puts upon the <hi>Elders</hi> that <hi>labour in the Word;</hi> requiring pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar <hi>Honours</hi> to be paid <hi>Them,</hi> above the Elders that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in <hi>Rule:</hi> which I preſum'd, He would not have done, if the Elders that <hi>rule</hi> (yea and rule <hi>well</hi>) had been more honourable than their Brethren.— Now the <hi>Animadverter</hi> ſingles out <hi>this Text,</hi> and makes his Exceptions againſt my Remarks upon it. I had obſerv'd, Either there muſt be but <hi>one</hi> Sort of Elder here ſpoken of; or there are <hi>two</hi> Kinds intended, one <hi>ruling,</hi> and the other <hi>teaching:</hi> (Which is but agreeable to Biſhop <hi>Burnet's</hi>

               </note> yet more eſpecially <hi>as Teachers.

So that, altho' I ſhou'd not be able to <hi>prove our Biſhops to have renounced the Powers of Preaching, when They were
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:002636_0055_0FE5D7D9E7C15670"/>
veſted with the Powers of Ruling,</hi> (but ſhould allow it to be <hi>falſe in Fact</hi>) Yet, ſince <hi>They</hi> are CHIEFLY to be honor'd for <hi>that</hi> Office, which they ſuſtain in <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> with other Clergymen, <hi>it will follow that they are to be honor'd with</hi> no greater <hi>Honors</hi> than what <hi>are due</hi> to mere Presbyters, veſted only with that ſingle Office. For the additional <hi>Powers of Ruling</hi> cauſe no new Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of <hi>Dignity</hi> to the Biſhop; and ſo can challenge no higher meaſures of Reſpect to him, than are owing to his Fellow-Presbyters. <hi>The Complication of the Offices</hi> (whatever my Animadverter may pretend) <hi>can have no Conſequence,</hi> to his Purpoſe, <hi>unleſs he can prove our Biſhops to have</hi> receiv'd ſome ſuperior Office (<hi>when they were veſted with the Powers of Ruling</hi>) to which <hi>are annexed Honours</hi> ſuperior to Thoſe, decreed by the Apoſtle, unto the Office of <hi>Labouring in the Word.</hi> And here I may illuſtrate this by a familiar Compariſon: We'l ſuppoſe (what is known Fact among us) that there are two Gentlemen of the <hi>Civil Order;</hi> agreeing in this, that both of them belong to his <hi>Majeſty's Council,</hi> but differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in another Circumſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> That one of them is alſo in the <hi>Commiſſion of the Peace,</hi> and the other not.

            <p>OR, if the <hi>ſecond,</hi> then by the Apoſtle's Rule here, a ſpecial Regard is to be paid unto <hi>thoſe Paſtors,</hi> that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel in the <hi>beſt Gifts,</hi> and moſt <hi>uſeful Labours;</hi> which be determines to be thoſe of <hi>Preaching.</hi> Miniſters are to be honour'd <hi>for their Work ſake;</hi> which comprehends thoſe two great Lines of Duty, <hi>Governing</hi> and <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> But <hi>Preaching</hi> is the <hi>main</hi> and <hi>more eminent</hi> part of their Work. — Now ſome excel in one of thoſe, and others in t'other.

            <p n="1">1.
