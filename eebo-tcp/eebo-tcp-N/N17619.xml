            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>A DISSERTATION ON THE MEANS OF PRESERVING HEALTH IN CHARLESTON, AND THE ADJACENT LOW COUNTRY.</p>
            <p>THE object of the medical profeſſion is not only to heal diſeaſes, but to prevent them. As it is my turn this evening to furniſh a ſubject of converſation for the ſociety, I ſhall, with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, ſubmit to their conſideration ſome practical obſervations on the means of preventing thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes which are moſt common in Charleſton and the vicinity. This I do the more readily as, having enjoyed almoſt uninterrupted health during a reſidence of ſixteen years in this climate, I hope that I may be allowed to have ſome experimental knowledge of the ſubject</p>
            <p>The foundation of good health through life, ſhould be laid in a proper treatment of infants. Their limbs ſhould be unconfined, and frequently rubbed. Their food ought to be plain and ſimple. They ſhould be kept conſtantly clean, and never ſuffered to remain wet for any length of time. Caps ſhould be laid aſide after the third or fourth month in winter, and much ſooner in ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Shoes and ſtockings may well be diſpenſed with through the whole period of infancy. Every prudent exertion ſhould be early made for harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conſtitution againſt ſudden changes of the atmoſphere. To this end exerciſe ſhould be freely and daily taken in the open air. When the weather turns ſuddenly cold, ſome additional cloathing may be proper; but it is often more for the intereſt of children, to habituate them to all the varieties
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:022828_0003_0FBA6CCEA17C8E38"/>of our weather, and even to expoſe them to occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional colds, than by an exceſs of care and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to induce a delicacy of habit.</p>
            <p>In nurſing cradles are hurtful. They add much to the heat of the infants who are confined between their narrow ſides. A hard matraſs is much cooler and on many accounts preferable. The youths who are accuſtomed to ſleep on the floor with bare blankets, will paſs through life with more independence and with greater advantanges than they who are accuſtomed to the relaxing indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of ſoft beds.</p>
            <p>On the propriety of uſing young children in this country to the cold bath, well informed phyſicians hold different opinions In ſome habits it certainly does good by bracing the tender limbs and fortifying the body againſt ſudden changes of the air, while in others the ſhock is too great. In general it may nevertheleſs be ſafely affirmed that a great majority of our children would have a better chance for eſcaping the diſeaſes of infancy, if they were from an early period of life habituated to the frequent uſe of the cold bath; and that very few caſes occur in which the daily waſhing of them in cold water would not be of advantage.</p>
            <p>Providence has kindly furniſhed us with an efficacious remedy for worms. Pink root is one of the beſt vermifuges in the world, and the ſeaſonable adminiſtration of it to our children, would ſave them from what often proves a ſource of diſeaſe and death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:022828_0004_0FBA6CD0C31BBEF0"/>The months of April and May have been found by long experience to be unfriendly to children in Charleſton. Parents ſhould, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, make arrangements for keeping them out of the city during theſe two months. Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try air is of ſingular utility not only for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting but curing that vomiting and purging which attacks children on the approach of warm weather. Where a retreat to the country is not practicable, the next beſt preventive of this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous complaint is cold bathing.</p>
            <p>The ſtomachs and inteſtines of infants ſhould be well cleanſed ſoon after they are born. That mothers ſhould reſt for ſeveral hours after their delivery is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſable. While they are recruited by repoſe after the ſufferings of parturition, their offspring may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for ſucking with ſafety. This can only be done by thoroughly emptying their ſtomachs and inteſtines.</p>
            <p>On this occaſion give me leave to obſerve, that the writings of phyſicians who have practiſed in colder climates are not applicable to this country. They repreſent the firſt milk of mothers as ſufficient to carry off the meconium of new born infants, but the contrary is known among us to every practitioner of phyſic. Milk either has not the ſame qualities, or does not produce the ſame effects in warm as in cold countries. In this climate it not only often fails in carrying off from new-born infants thoſe crudities the retention of which gives riſe to many diſeaſes, but inſtead thereof, by mingling with them, produces ſuch diſturbances in the alimentary canal, as frequently iſſue in imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:022828_0005_0FBA6CD40BD046D8"/>death. Much of the mortality among chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, eſpecially on plantations, is owing to this cauſe Overlaying, which is commonly ſaid to be the occaſion of their death, takes place much ſeldomer than has been ſuppoſed. The locked jaw of infants frequently ariſes from the irritation excited by the mixture of milk with meconium. If there is any one direction of primary conſequence for preſerving the health, and even the lives of infants, it is to empty their ſtomachs and bowels well before they are ſuffered to ſuck plentifully. A due attention to this matter would annually ſave many lives.</p>
            <p>For the preſervation of health and prevention of diſeaſes among adults, much is to be avoided and much is to be done. In the former claſs ſeveral particulars are to be reckoned. The firſt I ſhall mention is lying long in bed in the morning.</p>
            <p>The cooleſt period of the day is a little before ſun riſing. This naturally proves a temptation to ſpend thoſe precious moments in ſleep. If this is indulged, the body lies immerſed in the air which has been fouled by its perſpiration through the night, and in a ſituation which tends to relax it nearly as much as if it was in a vapor bath. By proper improvement of the morning, new life, vigor and ſpirits are imparted for bearing the noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide heat; but by continuing to ſleep, or even to loll, this opportunity of recruiting is loſt—the languor and debility which reſulted from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding day continues to increaſe, till a change of ſeaſon brings relief. The cool morning air acts like the cold bath in invigorating the body, and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:022828_0006_0FBA6CD56BFBC018"/>has an advantage over it by being inhaled and applied to the vitals. In another view of this ſubject, it may be added, that a man who riſes early will comparatively add ſeven years of the beſt time for ſtudy and buſineſs to a life of ſixty-five. Tho' early riſing is very wholſome, yet going abroad in the morning in the country, while the graſs is covered with dew, frequently produces fevers. To obtain the good, unmixed with the evil, the moſt ſhould be made of the cool morning air, but without wetting our feet with damp graſs, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe expoſing ourſelves to an undue abſorption of that moiſture which abounds for ſome time after the riſing of the ſun. As a further precaution againſt the chills of the morning, it would be pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent never to go abroad with an empty ſtomach. A glaſs of cold water, or ſlice of bread, or a draught of ſome bitter tea, taken immediately after riſing, would be beneficial.</p>
            <p>The above cautions of avoiding the morning dew may ſafely be diſpenſed with in many caſes. A man who waſhes his feet in cold water every day will hardly ever ſuffer from walking abroad in the morning. Nor will he who changes his ſhoes, and wipes his feet ſoon after they are wet from dewy graſs. It may farther be added, that if chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were educated as they ought to be, when grown up they would have little to fear from wet feet or morning dews.</p>
            <p>Immoderate drinking ſhould be avoided in this climate. To add the ſtimulus of large quantities of ſpirituous liquors to the heat occaſioned by a warm atmoſphere, is to add fuel to fire. Every
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:022828_0007_0FBA6CD6E4D342E8"/>evil that naturally reſults from an exceſs of heat, is aggravated by a plentiful uſe of ardent ſpirits. Theſe tend to inflame the blood, and concur with a warm ſun in wearing out the vitals, haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a premature old age and an untimely death. How far it would be for the benefit of our country to exterminate the uſe of diſtilled ſpirits, I will not undertake to determine, but have no heſitation in pronouncing, that the ſum of evil reſulting from their abuſe infinitely outweighs all the good that flows from them.</p>
            <p>The habit of immoderate drinking when once begun <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> on its unhappy votaries almoſt irreſiſtibly. In the intervals of ſobriety, they feel a faintneſs and oppreſſion which is intolerably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing. For this they find no relief but in a ſecond intoxication. As the liquor loſes its ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus, the doſe muſt be increaſed ſo as to procure an abatement of painful ſenſations. The remedy proves worſe than the diſeaſe, and both continue to increaſe in a fatal progreſſion from bad to worſe, from ordinary grog to undiluted Jamaica ſpirits: even the latter becomes inſufficient to warm the ſtomach, and inſtances ſometimes occur where the hotteſt peppers have been added to the warmeſt ſpirits to take off their fancied coldneſs. To enumerate all the diſeaſes which are brought on in this warm climate, by the abuſe of ardent ſpirits, would far exceed the limits to which I muſt confine myſelf. Suffice it to obſerve, that among them is the deſtruction of the digeſtive powers, obſtructions of the abdominal viſcera, dropſies and madneſs. Nothing can more powerfully illuſtrate the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:022828_0008_0FBA6CDBF47D2628"/>effects of rum than the havoc it makes among the Indians, who, from a robuſt and hardy race, by the free uſe of that pernicious liquid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come mad, waſte away and die. They who wiſh to preſerve health, ſhould ſummon up all their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to prevent the blandiſhments of company, or the ſeductions of appetite, from inducing them to deviate into the paths of intemperance; for, when once they have entered on that courſe, their return to the practice of that moderation and ſobriety which health requires, is always difficult and often impoſſible.</p>
            <p>Of the many forms in which ardent ſpirits are taken to the prejudice of health, none is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious than drams. Under the inſidious ſhew of fortifying the body againſt foggy and damp wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the practice of daily drinking drams has ſlain its thouſands. It gives a temporary ſtimulus to the ſyſtem, but this is ſoon followed with increaſed debility. It creates a falſe appetite, and tempts to the eating of more ſolid food than either nature craves or the ſtomach can digeſt. Theſe are its firſt effects. In proceſs of time conſequences of an oppoſite nature are produced. A loſs of appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, at leaſt for breakfaſt, is a common complaint among thoſe who have long been in the habit of drinking drams. To the evils reſulting from this ſource phyſicians have ſometimes incautiouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed by recommending the uſe of bitters. Though the bitters taken in ſubſtance, or in water, may be uſeful, the ſpirits in which they are moſtly prepared inſenſibly lead to the practice of dram-drinking.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:022828_0009_0FBA6CDD0F8B9958"/>Huxham's tincture of the bark is, on theſe principles, the occaſion of much miſchief. It would be for the intereſt of patients that phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians ſhould never preſcribe the internal uſe of any medicines prepared in ſpirits, except ſuch as are taken in ſmall doſes. They pay too dearly for being cured of fevers or bad appetites, who, by taking ſpirituous tinctures for that purpoſe, contract a fondneſs for drams. On this ſubject, it is worthy of remark, that health is often much injured by thoſe who are at all hours of the day ſipping ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous liquors, though they are never intoxicated. It is a good general rule never to drink any thing ſtronger than water, except at our meals.</p>
            <p>An intemperate use of animal food ſhould be avoided in this climate, eſpecially in ſummer. Exceſs in eating is as bad as exceſs in drinking. It excites a greater oppreſſion, and requires a greater exertion of the digeſtive organs. The warmer the weather, the greater is the tendency to putrefaction. It cannot be expected, that meat which becomes tainted in a few hours in market, can be much longer otherwiſe when it is taken immoderately into the ſtomach. As often as an undue proportion of meat is taken at a meal, nature is not only oppreſſed, but a foundation is laid for putrid diſeaſes. Perhaps in this view of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a ſmall proportion of ſalted meat, as being leſs diſpoſed to putrefaction than freſh, would be more ſuitable aliment in ſummer than has ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally been ſuppoſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:022828_0010_0FBA6CDE7460BCB8"/>Inactivity is another of the evils againſt which the votaries of health ſhould fix their moſt deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined oppoſition Many of our ſummer diſeaſes ariſe from ſuppreſſed perſpiration. From whatever cauſe this proceeds, languor and laſſitude are the immediate conſequences. Theſe unpleaſant ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations ought to be inſtantly removed; but to accompliſh that deſirable object, recourſe ſhould immediately be had to ſuch active exertions as are calculated to reſtore an equable and free perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Our feelings on theſe occaſions deceive us. They perſuade us to indulge in reſt, but a regard to health leads to activity. The ſenſe of wearineſs, which ariſes from ſuppreſſed perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is more eaſily overcome by reſiſting than yielding. The perſon who ſits or lies down will find his laſſitude to continue and increaſe; but he, who in oppoſition to his own feelings, makes a proper exertion of his active powers, will ſoon be relieved from it.</p>
            <p>The effects of exerciſe in promoting digeſtion, and all the regular functions of animal life, are too well known to need illuſtration. Suffice it to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, by way of applying the general obſervation to our local ſituation, that from the great moiſture of our atmoſphere, impediments to a free perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration frequently occur. Theſe ſhould be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teracted by ſuch conſtant, equable activity as, without heating the body, will keep all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions in their due order and proportion.</p>
            <p>Among the evils reſulting from indolence, a ſondneſs for drinking ardent ſpirits is not the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:022828_0011_0FBA6CDFE50E5BD0"/>leaſt. Human nature is ſo conſtituted that it requires ſomething to agitate it. Where the mind and body are both unemployed, the ſtimulus of ſtrong liquor becomes deſirable, as a means of exciting ſenſations, and of obviating the irkſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of having nothing to do.</p>
            <p>Inactivity is thus doubly deſtructive to health. Firſt, by its own primary effects; and, ſecondly, by leading to intemperance.</p>
            <p>Long ſittings at meals ſhould be avoided in this climate. All the evils reſulting from the ſources which have been already mentioned, are increaſed by the faſhionable cuſtom of ſpending three or four hours at the dinner table, for it leads to them all. The uſe of ſegars has the ſame ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency. They occaſion a waſte of the ſaliva, and of courſe injure the digeſtion of our food. They produce artificial thirſt, and conſequently lead to tipling. By taking off that ſenſe of uneaſineſs which reſults from having nothing to do, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy one of the moſt powerful incentives to action, and lead to habits of indolence. The ſmoke of the ſegars tends to correct the moiſture of the atmoſphere, and the uſe of them in ſome conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions may advantageouſly evacuate redundant phlegm; but the ſmall advantages procured in this way are outweighed by many greater evils which flow fom their daily uſe.</p>
            <p>Sudden changes from hot to cold air, violent exertions, depreſſing paſſions, hard rides, long walks, great fatigue, and exceſſes of all kinds, ſhould be guarded againſt by thoſe who are
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:022828_0012_0FBA6CE585C01778"/>anxious for the preſervation of health. Theſe cautions are particularly neceſſary in the interval between June and October; for, during that time, there is ſuch a morbid irritability of the whole ſyſtem, that irregularities, which in other months of the year might be harmleſs, ſeldom fail of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately drawing after them ſerious conſequences.</p>
            <p>Hunting clubs ſhould be wholly diſcontinued through the ſummer. They begin with violent exerciſe, and this is followed by plentiful eating and drinking. After exceſſive perſpiration has been excited by theſe means, a ride late in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloſes the ſcene. Few ſituations occur in which there is ſo dangerous a combination of the cauſes of our fevers as takes place on theſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. For ſimilar reaſons the game of fives, cricket, and in ſhort every ſpecies of diverſion or exerciſe that requires violent exertions ſhould be abandoned in warm weather.</p>
            <p>The time of expoſure to the ſun ſhould be ſhortened as much as poſſible. While we are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily expoſed to it, we ſhould abſtain from ardent ſpirits, and ſhould avoid ſtanding ſtill. It would alſo be proper to protect our heads from the effects of heat, by wearing white hats. Theſe will be much the better for deep crowns of ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction as leaves a vacancy between the head and the hat. Faſhion, which ſeldoms conſults either health or convenience, has lately deviated into what is ſalutary by introducing the uſe of flapped hats on the above conſtruction. Long may this
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:022828_0013_0FBA6CE6AABACFF0"/>faſhion continue, or rather may it never ceaſe to be the faſhion in Carolina.</p>
            <p>We ſhould be careful of lying in damp rooms, or in linen not ſufficiently dry; and we ſhould always put on dry cloaths, as ſoon as poſſible, after being wet. Chilling eaſterly winds, night air, and the evening dews ſhould be avoided. The latter are more pernicious than a thorough wetting from rain. Dew in this climate is of ſuch a pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating nature, that no ordinary covering can be depended on for excluding it. It inſinuates itſelf through our cloaths, and coming in contact with the ſkin, checks thoſe diſcharges which health requires. They who indulge themſelves in ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their evenings in open balconies, often pay dear for the hazardous gratification. The ground on which Charleſton ſtands was probably gained from the ocean, and is but a little higher than the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary level of the ſea. By digging eight or ten feet, we every where find water. From this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, together with the lowneſs of the ground, and the abundance of ſwamps and marſhes, we breathe an air abounding with moiſture. The heat of the ſun ſo commonly but unjuſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of, is beneficial by correcting this moiſture; but when his chearful influence is withdrawn, the natural dampneſs of the air becomes eminently pernicious. Sleeping with open windows is, for theſe reaſons, very injurious, eſpecially if great changes of the atmoſphere take place in the time of ſleep. Habit has ſo far inured ſeveral perſons to this practice, that they ſuffer nothing from it.
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:022828_0014_0FBA6CE825DCCB78"/>It muſt alſo be acknowledged, that the confined air of a ſmall cloſe room ſoon becomes unfit for reſpiration. In eſtimating matters of this kind, the advantages and diſadvantages ſhould be weighed againſt each other. An opinion formed in this way would, as a general rule, be in favor of ſleeping with ſhut windows, eſpecially ſuch as are near our beds. Perhaps the plan moſt conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with health and comfort would be, to ſleep in a room altogether cloſe, except a door which opened into an adjoining one, into which there was a free admiſſion of the external air. In every caſe we ſhould ſo arrange ourſelves as to be ſecure, that wind may not blow directly on us when we are at reſt, and eſpecially when we are compoſed for ſleep. The body of a man aſleep is in itſelf conſiderably cooler than when he is awake. There is, therefore, great danger from that undeſigned ſleep which often ſteals upon us in conſequence of thoſe lollings in which, when the weather is hot, we are prone to indulge ourſelves. They who wiſh to preſerve health ſhould reſiſt all temptations to ſleep, except in circumſtances where proper precautions are taken for defending the body from that abatement of animal heat which reſults from ſleep itſelf, and ſtill more from changes of the atmoſphere.</p>
            <p>The greateſt care ſhould be taken for the preſervation of cleanlineſs in our perſons, houſes, kitchens, yards, ſtables, pumps and ſtreets. The drains ſhould be kept conſtantly free from obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but if this cannot be done, the grates over
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:022828_0015_0FBA6CE9A6FA93A0"/>them ſhould be covered to keep down the effluvia that would otherwiſe iſſue from them to the great danger of the inhabitants. The low grounds of this city, in which water uſually ſtagnates, ſhould be filled up<note n="*" place="bottom">This might be done to a conſiderable extent, with little trouble or expence. If houſekeepers would charge themſelves with filling up the ponds before their own doors and in their own yards, a ſaving would ſoon be made in their Doctors bills which would amply reimburſe them.</note>.</p>
            <p>All offenſive and putrifying ſubſtances ſhould be burnt up, or at leaſt removed, ſo as to prevent their poiſoning the air we breathe. The number of dead animals, and the quantity of putrid vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables in our ſtreets, is a nuiſance of the moſt dangerous kind. The expence of keeping the city clean would be much leſs than what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in curing the diſeaſes that are foſtered by the filth of our ſtreets. The weeds which ſurround the planters houſes in the country ſhould, for the ſame reaſon, be burned in that ſeaſon of the year when they begin to rot.</p>
            <p>Coſtiveneſs ought to be particularly avoided in this climate. Regularity in the alvine diſcharges is of the laſt conſequence. Their retention, by diſturbing the whole animal oeconomy, proves a ſource of many evils. Whenever theſe diſcharges do not return at their proper period, efficacious methods ſhould be immediately adopted to aid the languid bowels in the diſcharge of their neceſſary functions. Riſing early is one of the beſt means of obviating coſtiveneſs. The cool morning air
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:022828_0016_0FBA6CEEBA6157D0"/>tends to throw the excrementitious humors on the bowels, and to haſten their diſcharge. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe is the caſe with ſuch perſons as ſpend an undue proportion of their time in a recumbent poſture, and particularly thoſe who lie in bed after ſunriſe. Attention to the ſtate of the bowels is particularly indiſpenſible in the ſummer and firſt months of the autumn. In moſt of the diſeaſes between June and November, the bile is more or leſs injuriouſly predominant, and ſhould be daily diſcharged. In the beforementioned period every article of meat or drink, known by experience to generate a ſurpluſage of bile, ſhould be either wholly laid aſide, or ſparingly uſed; and coſtiveneſs ſhould be obviated by the uſe of laxative food. Perhaps no ſimple in the power of every perſon is more efficacious, in preventing bilious complaints, than raw eggs beat up into an agreeable mixture and taken every morning.</p>
            <p>If notwithſtanding all our precautions to the contrary, a fever is beginning to form, inſtead of indulging the vain hope, that it will go off itſelf, we ſhould inſtantly retreat to our chambers, and take ſomething, that by reſtoring an equable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration will turn the current of humors from within outwardly. Nothing does this ſo effectually as a vomit. A proper medicine of that kind taken in time, when the introductory ſymptoms forebode a fever, will often deſtroy it in embryo, prevent a fit of ſickneſs, and the neceſſity of taking a variety of other medicines.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:022828_0017_0FBA6CF00A5B0428"/>In enumerating what ought to be done to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve health, the advantages of temperance and exerciſe are obvious; but inſtead of dilating on principles ſuited to every ſituation, it will be more proper to dwell on ſuch as eſpecially apply to our own. For eight months of the year, South-Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina is as healthy as any part of the globe. Our winters are delightful, and our greateſt ſummer heats are far from being intolerably diſtreſſing. The mercury in the thermometer riſes every year as high in Boſton, New-York and Philadelphia, as in Charleſton. I have lived in both of the latter cities, and can with truth declare, that I have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered more from heat, in each of them, than I ever did in Charleſton. If our ſummers are longer, and render us leſs able to bear continued fatigue, this is amply compenſated by the ſuperior mildneſs of our winters and the ſuperior fertility of our ſoil, which requires leſs labor for procuring ſubſiſtence. The inhabitants of this ſtate are in general, at all times, leſs liable to rheumatiſms, coughs, colds, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory diſorders, than thoſe who live in colder climates. Conſumptions, except a few from ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrh, are ſeldom ſeen amongſt our own citizens. Gravel and ſtone are comparatively rare in this country. But to fevers of the low kind, we are particularly expoſed, eſpecially in the interval between June and November. As theſe may be conſidered to be the endemic of the country, I beg leave to offer ſome practical obſervations on the means of preventing them. Our ſummer and autumnal fevers, as far as they depend on local
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:022828_0018_0FBA6CF1387BABC8"/>ſituation, chiefly ariſe from the ſeparate or combined influence of heat, moiſture, and marſh miaſmata. To ſecure the body againſt the effects of theſe enemies to health, is, or ought to be, an object of general attention. With this view, I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the wearing of flannel next the ſkin. It has already been obſerved, that in ſummer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration is great. Perhaps it is fortunate for us that it is ſo, for as many of our humors are by heat rendered morbid, the ſeaſonable diſcharge of them is highly beneficial. Where a perſon is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately covered with linen, the perſpirable matter, as faſt as thrown off, is collected and kept in contact with the ducts from which it exuded. On the other hand, flannel, by abſorbing the ſame, removes much of it from the ſkin. As the diſcharge of this excrementitious matter is beneficial, the reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it muſt be injurious. The gentle friction of flannel, which ſoon ceaſes to be diſagreeable, acts like a fleſh bruſh, and promotes an agreeable regular perſpiration, than which nothing is more conducive to health. Where the trunk of the body is immediately covered with woollen of any kind, the chance of ſuffering from ſudden changes of the atmoſphere is greatly leſſened. Summer colds are infinitely more dangerous than thoſe which take place in winter. To theſe we are particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the latter end of the warm weather, when the nights begin to grow cool. They who conſult only preſent gratification, are apt to diſencumber themſelves from the bed cloaths, and in that ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation they go to ſleep. This, though harmleſs in
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:022828_0019_0FBA6CF2A4686770"/>the firſt part of the night, often becomes injurious before day, either from ſudden changes of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere, or from that gradual cooling of it which takes place towards autumn. He who ſleeps in flannel has a conſtant defence againſt thoſe changes, and is thereby fortified againſt a common exciting cauſe of the diſorders of the ſeaſon. Such as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reconcile themſelves to the wearing of flannel conſtantly, ſhould at leaſt put it on when they are particularly expoſed. The inhabitants of Charleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton going to the country when fevers are riſe, would do well to obſerve this precaution, while they are out of the city, eſpecially if their buſineſs leads them to be much in rice fields, or in the vicinity of ſtagnant waters.</p>
            <p>Cold bathing, under proper regulations, is an excellent preventive of the diſeaſes of this country. As heat relaxes, it is obvious that cold muſt brace. Once in twenty-four hours, to immerſe the body in cold water, moſt powerfully ſtrengthens the whole ſyſtem. Perſpiration, though for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment checked, increaſes with the returning glow, which immediately follows when the bathed perſon is wiped dry and begins to take exerciſe. If this is done in the evening, it ſeldom fails of procuring a good night's reſt: if in the morning, it fortifies the body for bearing the heat of the following day. By bracing the whole ſyſtem, it deſtroys that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition to diſeaſes, which is brought on by the relaxing qualities of heat and moiſture. It is farther ſerviceable by keeping the ſkin conſtantly clean. Such is the exceſſive perſpiration in this
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:022828_0020_0FBA6CF7D65BB1A0"/>country, in the ſummer, that frequent waſhings are indiſpenſably neceſſary to preſerve cleanlineſs. This precaution is too often neglected where peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odical bathings are diſuſed. The advantages from even a partial uſe of the cold bath are great. Colds in the head are very uncommon when it is daily waſhed in cold water. The eyes of a perſon who frequently plunges them, wide open, into cold water, will ſeldom be either weak or inflamed. Diſeaſes of the throat rarely attack thoſe who daily waſh their necks with cold water. Frequent waſhings of the mouth prevent much of the tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ache. It has already been obſerved, that the perſon who daily waſhes his feet in cold water, will hardly ever ſuffer from expoſing himſelf to the dews of the morning. So many diſeaſes might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, and ſo much good might be done by a judicious uſe of bathing, that every gentleman ought to have an apparatus in his houſe for that purpoſe. Sometimes cold water, and ſometimes tepid, ought to be uſed. In other caſes waſhing would be preferable to bathing. To adjuſt theſe, and ſeveral other particulars, and to prevent the miſchiefs that might ariſe from indiſcreet bathing, the advice of a phyſician is often neceſſary.</p>
            <p>The aliment uſed in ſummer ſhould be anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeptic and generous. The influence of what we eat and drink is very great. Butter and fat meats tend evidently to clog the ſtomach and vitiate the bile, and therefore ſhould be laid aſide, or ſparingly uſed in hot weather. A due proportion of meat and vegetables is proper. Pepper, and the other
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:022828_0021_0FBA6CF8E45B6F20"/>warm condiments, which are uſed in ſeaſoning, though in theory they ſeem to be improper, in a country where heat abounds, are found by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience to be wholeſome. They are for the moſt part the productions of warm climates, and we find that the productions of all countries ſuit beſt with their inhabitants. As no diſh is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among negroes than pepperpot, ſo none is more wholeſome. Dr. Lind obſerves, that "the negroes in the torrid zone commonly mix the moſt ſtimulating, poignant ſauces with their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary light food, and this is experimentally found ſuitable to their conſtitutions." In uſing fruit the following cautions ſhould be obſerved. It ſhould be thoroughly ripe, and taken only in moderation, and baked or ſtewed rather than raw. A total abſtinence, for ſome time after recovering from fevers, would be beſt for convaleſcents. Watermelons are not only innocent but uſeful. They may ſafely be taken in many fevers, and under qualified circumſtances, tend to prevent the diſeaſes uſually prevalent when they are in ſeaſon. Water is Nature's diluent. It is the only drink that can be ſafely taken at all times and by all perſons; but, nevertheleſs, men in every age and country, and in every ſtate of ſociety, have ſought for ſomething that was more ſtimulant. Of all the additions made to water for that purpoſe, rum is the moſt pernicious. It contains no nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but like a ſlow poiſon inſenſibly undermines the ſprings of life. As mankind will not content themſelves with nature's beverage, it is the duty
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:022828_0022_0FBA6CFA2C044B98"/>of phyſicians to direct them to ſuch ſubtitutes as bring the greateſt benefits with the leaſt injury. Of this claſs are liquors which are prepared by fermentation, and alſo thoſe which are expreſſed from vegetables. Of the drinks uſed among us, none are equal to porter and wine for preventing fevers. The former, by its bitterneſs, ſtrengthens the ſtomach, while it proves highly nutritious, and at the ſame time moderately evacuant. Obſtinate vomitings are ſometimes cured by it, more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally than by the moſt celebrated officinal compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions. Within ten years paſt, in which the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of this city have generally exchanged punch for porter, they have grown much more healthy. Complaints of the bowels have ſenſibly leſſened. Phyſicians are not now called upon to attend one patient with the dry belly-ache for every ten they formerly viſited. Punch, when weak and taken in moderation, and no oftener than occaſionally, is ſalutary and refreſhing, but by no means ſuits for common drink. The ſame obſervation holds good with reſpect to cyder. Mineral acids, diluted with water, correct bile, and reſiſt our ſummer diſeaſes; but this cannot be affirmed of drinks prepared with limes and ſuch like vegetable acids when freely and frequently taken. Theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, though generally well founded, admit of exceptions.</p>
            <p>The temperate uſe of good ſound wine is one of the moſt effectual, as well as one of the pleaſanteſt, antidotes to fevers. It is highly antiſeptic, and both prevents and cures putrid diſeaſes. It is
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:022828_0023_0FBA6CFBA5143000"/>much more worthy of the appellation of a cordial, than any of the boaſted officinal compoſitions, which are called by that name. Different conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions require different wines, but in general old Madeira agrees beſt with the inhabitants of Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina. All phyſicians know, that in low fevers a liberal uſe of wine is an eſſential part of the cure. In order to get the full benefit of this moſt deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable preventive of our ſummer diſeaſes, it ſhould not be drank every day. If it was laid aſide in the winter and ſpring, and reſumed on the approach of ſummer, and continued in daily uſe, only for three or four months, its efficacy in preventing ſummer and autumnal diſeaſes would be greatly increaſed. The perſon who, with the above limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, drinks from half a pint to a pint of wine every twenty-four hours cannot, in this climate, be juſtly deemed intemperate.</p>
            <p>The daily uſe of ſtrong warm teas is pernicious. Many reſpectable medical authorities might be produced, which concur in repreſenting Eaſt-India tea as unfriendly to the nerves. Be this as it may, all muſt acknowledge, that the warm water, which is uſed as its vehicle, muſt be unſuitable to this climate.</p>
            <p>Cheerfulneſs is of particular ſervice in preſerving health. Many of our diſeaſes flow from bile, and fretfulneſs never fails to cauſe an increaſed flux of that acrid humor into the ſtomach. Thoſe who watch their own feelings may obſerve, that when any wayward event breaks in on the peace of their minds, a bitter taſte is immediately felt. This
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:022828_0024_0FBA6D00D088C9C0"/>proceeds from an overflowing of bile. Bilious perſons are for the moſt part peeviſh, and peeviſh perſons are for the moſt part bilious. Bile and fretfulneſs ſeem to be reciprocally cauſe and effect, and both prediſpoſe to dangerous diſorders. The eyes are ſometimes obſerved to turn ſuddenly yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, in a guſt of paſſion. They who are bleſſed with a conſtant, equable flow of cheerful ſpirits, are exempted from one of the occaſional cauſes of fevers: On the other hand, ſuch as give way to peeviſhneſs, or to the depreſſing paſſions, are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly expoſed to the diſeaſes, which a low, moiſt country is apt to produce.</p>
            <p>In particular habits, the daily uſe of jeſuit's bark, from July till October, is adviſeable. Three doſes of it, combined with a little rhubarb if neceſſary, taken in ſubſtance, every day or every other day, where ordinary precautions are taken, may in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral be relied upon as an effectual antidote to the ſummer and autumnal fevers of this country.</p>
            <p>Throughout the ſummer and the firſt month of the autumn, fires are more uſeful in damp days, than in the dry cold weather of winter. They correct the exceſſive moiſture of the atmoſphere, and counteract the exciting cauſes of the complaints moſt uſual in the before mentioned ſeaſons.</p>
            <p>In the conſtruction of our houſes, we ſacrifice health to profit and convenience, by digging cellars underneath them. The walls at their ſides, and covers to their bottoms, leſſen the evils that might otherwiſe reſult from them, but it would be better if there was not a cellar in the city. The
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:022828_0025_0FBA6D01D45AFFA0"/>evils ariſing from this ſource are of ſuch a magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, as to need the interpoſition of the city coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. A law to compel all the inhabitants to pump the water out of their cellars, as ſoon as it begins to ſtagnate, would be ſalutary. It muſt have frequently occurred to every attentive obſerver, that, in wet ſeaſons, the cellars in the low part of this city emit ſuch putrid exhalations, as are ſenſibly offenſive even to paſſengers. They who live over ſuch cellars, or in the vicinity of them, muſt, therefore, be particularly expoſed to diſeaſes, and when ſick, are with difficulty cured, unleſs they remove to a purer atmoſphere.</p>
            <p>The practice of planting trees before the doors of dwelling houſes, is recommended by ſound medical reaſoning It has been demonſtrated, that trees abſorb unhealthy air, and diſcharge it in a highly purified ſtate, in the form of what modern chymiſts call dephlogiſticated air. It is only to be lamented, that the cuſtom is not univerſal, and that ſome uniformity is not obſerved in the diſpoſition of theſe beneficial ornaments. Should the preſent city council make effectual arrangements for plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing magnolias, or ſuch like trees, every twelve or fifteen feet, on each ſide of our ſtreets, through their whole length, they would merit the thanks of the riſing generation.</p>
            <p>Whether paving the ſtreets of Charleſton would conduce to the health of the inhabitants, has been doubted by many. It might add to the heat of the air, but would leſſen its morbid qualities, by repreſſing exhalations. As dry heat alone is a
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:022828_0026_0FBA6D032BC28F78"/>much leſs evil than heat, moiſture and miaſmata combined, it is probable, that the inhabitants would be gainers, on balancing the advantages againſt the diſadvantages that would reſult from paving the ſtreets of this city.</p>
            <p>In conſtructing our city houſes, we ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to make them, eſpecially on their north, ſouth and weſt ſides, as open as poſſible to favor the circulation of freſh air. A man in health pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutes a gallon of air in a minute, to ſuch a degree, as to render it unfit for the purpoſes of life. The danger of breathing confined, unventilated air, muſt be therefore ſelf-evident. On theſe principles, the uſe of curtains, other than thoſe for excluding muſquitoes, may be advantageouſly diſpenſed with. They ſeldom or never do any good, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining and heating the air often do harm.</p>
            <p>The late practice of adding an attic ſtory to low houſes, is not only ornamental but beneficial. It increaſes the chances for health The higher we aſcend into the atmoſphere, the cooler it is, and the farther are we removed from thoſe poiſonous exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations which, though they riſe from the earth and ſtagnant waters, ſeldom or never aſcend to any conſiderable height. It is on theſe accounts pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to ſleep in the higheſt apartments of our houſes, unleſs where their low pitch and converging ſides make them warmer than thoſe which are on the lower floors.</p>
            <p>Wooden houſes are moſt ſuitable to this cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate. They are much drier, and conſequently healthier, than thoſe which are built with brick.
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:022828_0027_0FBA6D04A4796318"/>The latter abſorb and retain, for a long time, much of that moiſture with which our atmoſphere abounds. The ſpeedy rotting of paper on back walls proves their dampneſs. This is particularly the caſe, when ſome of their ſides are inacceſſible to the ſun. In ſuch ſituations they are ſeldom, for any conſiderable length of time, thoroughly dry. On this account, ſuch of the inhabitants of this city as are troubled with rheumatic pains, coughs and complaints of the breaſt, ſhould not live on that part of the Bay which is between its ſouthern extremity and Broad ſtreet. The houſes there are moſtly built with brick, and are ſo cloſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected together, that two, and often three of their ſides are, for the greateſt part of the day, ſheltered from the direct rays of the ſun Moiſture there predominates, and, in conjunction with eaſterly winds, is very unfavorable to children and ſuch as have weak lungs. Brick houſes would be much drier than they uſually are, if a vacancy was left between the walls and the plaſtering on their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. This might eaſily be done by means of ſtuds projecting but a few inches from the walls.</p>
            <p>The poſition of our country houſes, with reſpect to ſwamps, ought to be attended to; for the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer winds, ſweeping along their ſurface, waft deſtruction to the inhabitants. In general, the planters would do well to encourage the growing of trees, between their houſes and the neighboring ſwamps; and to conſtruct their houſes ſo as to have neither-doors nor windows fronting on marſhy ground; but as this cannot always be done, they
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:022828_0028_0FBA6D09D363A368"/>ſhould build on the ſouth ſides of their rice fields and other waters. The winds in the ſummer months are for the moſt part ſoutherly. To be under a neceſſity of breathing air, ſaturated with the noxious effluvia acquired in paſſing over ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant waters, muſt be highly injurious. Indeed if health was, as it ought to be, preferred to riches, the planters would build their dwelling houſes at a diſtance from the rivers. The inhabitants of a houſe in the pine barren has a much better chance for health, than he whoſe manſion is erected in the neighbourhood of any body of water, either ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or running. Health and wealth ſeem to be at variance. The ſame qualities of the ſoil which make it fruitful, make it alſo unwholſome, while the dry ſurface of pine barren preſents compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively a pure and wholſome air. Beſides, the reſin of the pine trees in itſelf contributes to the ſalubrity of the atmoſphere. It is an old and well authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticated obſervation, that perſons whether white or black, employed in burning tar-kilns, are always healthy. The method practiſed by Indians and negroes of living in ſmoke, is conducive to health; but the inconvenience of ſuch a ſituation will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever operate againſt its being introduced into common uſe among our citizens; but, nevertheleſs, ſome conſiderable analogous benefit, with little expence or inconvenience, might be procured to thoſe who reſide in the country, from fires kindled round or near their houſes. Theſe will be more neceſſary when the wind is eaſterly, and more beneficial if made with reſinous pine-wood.</p>

               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:022828_0029_0FBA6D0AD500FBD0"/>On theſe principles, there is no difficulty in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting why Charleſton is more healthy than the neighboring pariſhes. It has long been obſerved in low countries, that they who reſide in towns, are more healthy than thoſe who live diſperſed in the country, and that the inhabitants of the central parts of towns are healthier than thoſe who live in their extremities. The fire and ſmoke from ſeveral hundred contiguous kitchens cannot fail of dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the moiſtneſs of the atmoſphere. The frequent ringing of bells, the flowing of the tides, the motion of carriages and of perſons, occaſions a briſker circulation of air in this city, than in the adjacent country. The policy of removing, on the approach of ſummer, from the country to Charleſton, is therefore wiſe. The proper time for making this change varies in different years. In general it may be obſerved, that it ſhould be early, if a wet ſpring is followed by a dry ſummer. While ſucceſſive rains keep the waters in motion, the danger is little; but when warm and dry wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther continues for ſome time after heavy rains have fallen, fevers will probably ſoon begin to rage.</p>
            <p>Strangers who propoſe to reſide in this country, and our own citizens who have been long abſent, when intending to return, ſhould make a point of arriving here about the month of November. They would then have at leaſt half a year to be aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the climate, before their health would be endangered by any thing peculiar to it. The ſudden deaths among us of perſons diſuſed to our country, are to be referred to an injudicious choice
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:022828_0030_0FBA6D0C2CEEA7B0"/>of time for coming to it, and ſtill more to their own imprudence, combined with the hoſpitality of the inhabitants. To be invited almoſt daily to the plentiful tables of their friends and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, is the misfortune of ſuch perſons A fever, rapid in its progreſs, and fatal in its iſſue, is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the conſequence. Strangers coming into this country ſhould be doubly on their guard, but inſtead thereof they too often ſuffer themſelves to be feaſted into fevers, and not unfrequently out of their lives.</p>
            <p>On a review of the whole ſubject, it may be obſerved, that inſtead of ſaying, "this capital is more ſickly than the other maritime towns of the United States," it ought only to be ſaid, "that more care is neceſſary on the part of its inhabitants for the preſervation of their health." By proper attention to our children, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by ſteady, diſcreet management of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, much of the mortality of infants might be prevented, and a new generation be reared, which would be much hardier and better adapted to the climate than many of the preſent. In fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies where children have been properly brought up, many of both ſexes have as good conſtitutions as are enjoyed by thoſe who live in more northern latitudes. The honors of old age are often attained by our citizens. Indeed the chance of life to a perſon who is above ſixty years old, is conſiderably in favor of the inhabitants of warm countries. It muſt be acknowledged, that the variableneneſs and ſudden changes of our atmoſphere make caution
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:022828_0031_0FBA6D0DCBF18690"/>indiſpenſable; but this as enforcing the neceſſity of a ſober, orderly life, ought to be eſteemed an advantage. None of the bleſſings of this world can be attained without care. It is, therefore, unreaſonable to look for health on eaſier terms. Much attention is neceſſary to preſerve, even a good eſtate, from running to waſte. The ſame is requiſite for guarding a ſound conſtitution againſt diſeaſes. As well may the planter, who rarely viſits his plantation, expect a good crop, as the man who lives at random, look for the continued en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of health Such as are for a ſhort life and a merry one, muſt abide by the conſequences of their choice. But they who conduct with prudence, and have ſelf-denial to abſtain from ſuch practices as experience may have proved to be hurtful, and ſteadineſs to follow what by the ſame unerring rule they have found to be ſalutary, may live as health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily, and as long in this city, as in any part of the world.</p>
