            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAVING ſeen ſeveral <hi>Pieces</hi> of your printing very well wrote, and obſerving that you are ready to print what may tend either to ſerve the Publick, or to pleaſe, or inſtruct any of your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. I am now induc'd to become your Correſpondent, and flatter myſelf, that, if I do not happen to anſwer the Purpoſes juſt mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I ſhall, however, offend no body, ſince my Intention is to treat of <hi>Things,</hi> rather than <hi>Perſons;</hi> and if I endeavour to expoſe Error and Vice, or to recommend Virtue and Truth, it ſhall be without any invidious Reflections, or particular Applications.</p>
            <p>The Subject I propoſe, at preſent, is that of Oaths; whereby I do not mean the idle and unneceſſary Swearing, too frequently met with in common Converſation, which, as Mr. <hi>Habbs</hi> rightly obſerves, <hi>is not properly Swearing, but an impious Cuſtom of prophaning the Name of God, gotten by too much Vehemence in talking.</hi> But my Deſign is to conſider Oaths as they are required by Law, to be taken by Officers judicial and miniſterial, as well as by Witneſſes, in the ſeveral Courts of Juſtice, and to ſhew their binding Nature, together with the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Conſequences of acting in Breach of them, with Regard to the Community, to the Parties guilty, and to thoſe that are immediately intereſted in the Thing in Queſtion.</p>
            <p>We find then that all civiliz'd Countries and Nations have ſeen the Uſe and Neceſſity of Oaths, and tho' the Forms thereof have been various, according to the different Cuſtoms and Religions that have prevailed, yet they all agree in the Reaſon and Policy of them, which is more firmly to bind the Takers to declare the Truth, or to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Thing thereby promiſed to be done, from the Fear of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending inviſible Powers, or the Dread of ſubjecting themſelves to the Penalty which the Laws of the Society annexed to the Crime of ſwearing falſly. And it is certain, that the very <hi>Heathens</hi> look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Perjury as a Sin of the deepeſt Dye, as will ſufficiently appear from what <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> relates of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> that, by their
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:006015_0004_1027754ECDFEC380"/>
Laws, <hi>Perſons who had forſworn themſelves, were adjudged to Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Puniſhments, as guilty of the two greateſt Crimes, in inviolating that Piety which they owed to God, and in deſtroying Faith from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men, the ſtrongeſt Pillar of human Society</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. c. 77.</note>. Nay, ſome of thoſe People, who had only the Light of Nature for their Guide, carried their Notions of the Malignity of this Crime ſo far, that they ſuppoſed Poſterity often puniſhed for the Perjuries of their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors; an Opinion, as <hi>Grotius</hi> obſerves, <hi>that was never entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but in Caſes of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> enormous Crimes.</hi> And <hi>Cicero,</hi> who ſays <hi>that our Anceſtors could never find out any Thing ſtronger than an Oath, to bind us to the faithful Diſcharge of what we had engaged;</hi> adds, that <hi>whatever is promiſed by calling God, as it were, to witneſs to your Words, ought punctually to be performed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our famous Lawyer, the Lord Chief-Juſtice <hi>Coke,</hi> tells us, that <q>an Oath is an Affirmation or Denial by any Chriſtian, of any Thing lawful and honeſt, before one or more, that have Authority to give the ſame, for Advancement of Truth and Right, calling Almighty God to witneſs that his Teſtimony is true. And it is twofold, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Aſſertiorum ut de pretaerito, ſicut Teſtes et ſen Promiſſorium de fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turo, ſicut Judices, Juſticiarii, Officiarii,</hi> &amp;c. So as an Oath is ſo ſacred, and ſo deeply concerneth the Conſciences of Chriſtian Men, as the ſame cannot be adminiſtred to any, unleſs allowed by the Common-Law, or by ſome Act of Parliament; neither can any Oath, allowed by the Common Law, or by Act of Parliament, be altered but by Act of Parliament. It is called a corporal Oath, becauſe he toucheth with his Hand ſome Part of holy Scripture.</q> 3 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 165.</p>
            <p>And, according to a no leſs eminent Foreigner, the learned <hi>Puffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorf,</hi> (with whom our Divines concur) <hi>An Oath is a religious Aſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veration, by which we either renounce the Mercy, or imprecate the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of Heaven, if we ſpeak not the Truth<note n="‖" place="bottom">De Jur. Nat. <hi>&amp;</hi> Gen. Lib. <hi>4. c. 2.</hi> Sect <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note>;</hi> which Definition does more immediately regard thoſe that are ſworn as Witneſſes, and comes within that Claſs of Oaths which the Caſuiſts call <hi>aſſertory.</hi> But the ſame religious Aſſeveration is uſed by <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> and other Civil Officers, whoſe Oaths are of the <hi>Promiſſary Kind.</hi> Thus the Purport of an Oath, taken by the former, is to do equal Juſtice to the Poor and the Rich, without Favour or Malice, and generally to give
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:006015_0005_1027755051F1E328"/>
Sentence in the Caſe before them, as Juſtice and Equity ſhall direct; ſo the latter are ſworn to the faithful Diſcharge of their reſpective Truſts and Employments, and both upon the ſame Terms of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the Mercy, and calling upon themſelves the Vengeance of God Almighty, if they perform not what they thus engage to do. It muſt be confeſs'd, however, that an Oath does not directly produce a new Obligation; for a Covenant or Promiſe, if lawful, binds in the Sight of God, and in <hi>fore Conſcientiae,</hi> without an Oath, which is therefore an additional Bond only to what was valid before. Yet it cannot from this be inferr'd, that an Oath is therefore ſuperfluous and unneceſſary. <hi>For,</hi> as the excellent Author juſt cited, ſays, <hi>tho' all Men, who are not Atheiſts, believe that God will puniſh the Violation of Promiſes, not confirm'd by Oath, yet they believe at the ſame Time, and with good Reaſon, that thoſe Wretches will feel a more ſevere Vengeance, who have, in expreſs Terms, called down the Wrath of God upon themſelves, and as far as in them lies, have ſhut themſelves out from all Hopes of Mercy, whilſt they engaged in Wickedneſs with ſo full a Purpoſe and Deſign, as to ſhew that they valued not the Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of him who is able to beſtow the greateſt Goods, and to inflict the greateſt Evils</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Id. B. <hi>4.</hi> Ch. <hi>2.</hi> Sect <hi>6.</hi>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>Now, as it is of the utmoſt Importance to Government, that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſhould be equally adminiſtred; and ſince, without Integrity in the Magiſtrate, the Veracity of Witneſſes will be of little Avail for this Purpoſe, I ſhall begin with the <hi>Bench,</hi> and make a few Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on the Duty of thoſe that are advanced to it, on Account of their Oath. But I muſt firſt premiſe, that, as it cannot be expected our Courts of Juſtice in this diſtant Colony ſhould be fill'd with Men of Knowledge, Learning, and Experience, equal to thoſe at Home, great Allowances are to be made on that Account. If therefore we meet in them, joined with common Abilities, an upright Mind, a ſincere Deſire for Information, and a ſteady Diſpoſition to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially juſt, according to the beſt of their Underſtandings, I think they will be entitled to the Reſpect due to their Characters, and dare promiſe too, they will in that Caſe, and with thoſe Qualities, for the moſt Part, ſufficiently anſwer the End of their Appointment.</p>
            <p>Judges and Magiſtrates then, whether they are fitting in Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on Matters of private Property, or in order to puniſh publick
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006015_0006_102775534F7A72B8"/>
Offenders, are under the ſtrongeſt and moſt ſolemn Obligations to do what is Right, and to diſpoſſeſs themſelves of all Paſſions, and of every Conſideration which may biaſs them to the contrary. As they are Men, it is not expected, they ſhould be infallible; and therefore they are greatly favour'd by our Law, in the Execution of their Office, according to the Maxim, <hi>De f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ie &amp; officio judicis can recipitur q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>iis.</hi> It is not to be preſum'd that they who are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the Laws, and the Diſpenſation of Juſtice amongſt the King's People, that have the Power of determining the Rights and Properties of their Fellow Subjects, which they are ſworn to do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws, will yet be ſo monſtrouſly perſidious as to act otherwiſe. But, notwithſtanding this, it is too well known that there have been in all Ages, and in every Country, wicked Judges, and perjur'd Magiſtrates, ſome of whom have been called to an Account in this World, but many more left to anſwer for their moſt execrable Villanies in another, before a Tribunal that does not ſtand in Need of the Help of Witneſſes to come at the Truth, and from which no Fact can be concealed, nor any Offender eſcape the Puniſhment ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to his Crimes.</p>
            <p>The uſual Temptations to an evil Magiſtrate are downright <hi>Bribery,</hi> the <hi>Fear of offending,</hi> or the <hi>Hopes of pleaſing;</hi> all which I think may be included in the firſt, ſince the two laſt are, in truth, but different Kinds or Degrees of the other.</p>
            <p>Direct Bribery in a Judge, in relation to a Cauſe depending be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, was, at Common-Law, look'd upon us an Offence of ſo heinous a Nature (being complicated with Perjury. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) that before the Stat. of 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. it had ſometimes been puniſhed as High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And our Books make mention of one Sir <hi>Thomas Wayland,</hi> Chief-Juſtice of the Common Pleas, in the Time of <hi>E.</hi> 1. who was attainted of Felony, for taking of Bribes, his Lands and Goods for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited, and he baniſhed the Kingdom, as unworthy to live in that State which he had ſo much abuſed. In like Manner, Sir <hi>William Thorpe,</hi> Chief Juſtice of the King's-Bench, having been convicted of receiving Bribes of three ſeveral Perſons, amounting to 100 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> was adjudged to be hanged for it, and all his Lands and Goods forfeited. The Reaſon of the Judgment is entered in the Roll in theſe Words, <hi>Quia praedict.</hi> Willielmus Thorpe, <hi>qui ſacramentum Domini Regis irga populum ſuum habuit ad cullodiendum fiegit malitioſe, falſe, &amp; rebeluter, quantum in ipſum ſuit.</hi> Becauſe that he, as much as in
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006015_0007_10277554E856F720"/>
him lay, had broken the King's Oath made to the People, which the King had intruſted him withal. It was, however, declar'd that this Judgment was not to be drawn into Example againſt any other Officers who ſhould break their Oaths, but only againſt thoſe <hi>qui praedictum ſacramentum fecerunt, &amp; fregerunt, &amp; habent Leges An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliae as cuſtodiendum;</hi> that is, only the Oaths of the Judges who are entruſted with the Laws. This Judgment being given, in the 24th of <hi>E.</hi> 3. there was a Debate next Year in Parliament, whether it was legal or not, when, <hi>nullo contradicente,</hi> it was declared to be juſt, and according to Law, and that the ſame may be given in Time to come upon the like Occaſion. The Sentence of the Earl of <hi>Middleſex</hi> did not, indeed, extend to Life, but was very ſevere, and plainly indicated the Abhorrence the Parliament had of his Crimes. Theſe were delaying Juſtice to the Farmers of the Cuſtoms, in a Matter referr'd to him by K. <hi>James</hi> I. and taking exorbitant Bribes; for which, he was ſentenced to loſe all his Offices which he held in the Kingdom, to be for ever incapable of an, Office, Place, or Employment in the State; to be impriſon'd in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> during the King's Pleaſure; to be fined 50,000 <abbr>l.</abbr> never to ſit in Parliament any more, nor to come within the Verge of the King's Court. Happy had it been for theſe Judges and Great Men, I have named, with ſome others that might have been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, if, inſtead of <hi>making Haſte to be rich,</hi> they had duly adverted to the Words of ſacred Writ; <hi>Neither take a Gift; for a Gift doth blind the Eyes of the Wicked, and pervert the Words of the Righteous.</hi>

            <p>But expreſs Bribery is ſo ſhameful, as well as dangerous a Crime, that it is ſeldom practiſed; at leaſt it is dore ſo privately, that we very rarely hear of Inſtances of it; and therefore I ſhall proceed to the other corrupt Motives mentioned above, <hi>viz.</hi> the Fear of offending, or the Hopes of pleaſing any body whatever; both which are equally bad, and I doubt are too often prevalent, even in our own Country, as well as other Parts of the World. <hi>Fear</hi> proceeds from Cowardice, and ariſes from the Want of Reſolution to ſtand the Conſequences that may follow the doing the Thing under Conſideration. A learned Judge, who at this Time adorns one of the Courts of <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> finely obſerves, that <hi>Cowardice in a Judge is but another Name for Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They differ only as the Act and Habit. Bribery is Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006015_0008_1027755684D90720"/>
in the Act; but Cowardice is habitual Corruption.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Ded. to <hi>Forteſc.</hi> of the Diff. between an abſ. and a mix'd Monarchy.</note> And certain it is, that as long as a Magiſtrate labours under the powerful Influence of Fear, he will be always liable to be corrupted; and, on every Occaſion, will reaſon with himſelf to this, or the like Effect: How will my Determination in this Cauſe ſuit my own Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? Who are the Parties intereſted in the Queſtion? Or what their Attachments? I muſt not give Judgment againſt ſuch a Man, tho' I am convinced it is right, leſt I offend him, or ſome other, who will have it in his Power to do me, or mine, ſuch or ſuch an ill Office: If I ſhould vote ſo and ſo, I ſhall make ſuch a Perſon my Enemy, or diſoblige ſuch a One, who is my Friend. And thus, for Fear his doing the Thing which is juſt ſhould interfere with his own private Affairs, or, perhaps, with the Schemes of the Party he has eſpouſed, he will deprive his Neighbour of his Eſtate, or his Liberty, nay, perhaps, of his Life, and thereby bring upon himſelf a wounded Conſcience, which (if it does not at length prove ſear'd by repeated Practice) may make him continually uneaſy in this Life, and greatly hazard his eternal Happineſs, if not inſure his eternal Miſery, in the next. How much more noble, more rational, and more ſafe then, is the Way of thinking and arguing of that honeſt Magiſtrate, who conſiders only what is Law, and what is juſt: Am I convinced theſe are in Favour of my greateſt Enemy, and againſt my moſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Friend, and ſhall I yet, in Breach of my Duty, my Oath, and my Honour, give Judgment againſt the former, and for the latter? Will this be anſwering the End of my being appointed in the Office I fill? Or rather, ſhall I not, whatever Evil enſue, or how inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſoever it may prove, diſcharge my Conſcience, and the Truſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in me? Certainly this laſt every Man ſhould reſolve to do in all Inſtances, who accepts of a Commiſſion. Which brings to my Mind the Oath the King's of <hi>Egypt</hi> impoſed on their Judges, and made them ſolemnly ſwear, <hi>viz. That they ſhould not do any Thing contrary to their Conſcience, even tho' never ſo earneſtly commanded by themſelves:</hi> For tho' the Oath taken by our Judges is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the ſame expreſs Terms, yet it is vertually the ſame, as will be farther ſhewn hereafter.</p>
            <p>What has been argued, concerning <hi>Fear,</hi> will be equally appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to the other Motive <hi>Hope,</hi> as they both proceed from the ſame
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:006015_0009_10277558709C1B68"/>
ill Principle. The ſacred Authority, I have once before quoted, ſays, <hi>Thou ſhalt not wreſt Judgment, nor reſpect Perſons;</hi> and the wiſeſt of Men tells us, that <hi>to have Reſpect of Perſons is not good; for, for a Piece of Bread</hi> that <hi>Man will tranſgreſs;</hi> intimating how ſmall a Matter will warp ſuch a Man's Judgment. It would therefore be no ſtrange Thing to ſee ſuch an One thruſt himſelf into the Seat of Juſtice, purely to <hi>wreſt Judgment,</hi> attend a Court meerly out of <hi>Reſpect to Perſons,</hi> and go predetermined on one Side of the Queſtion, however the Cauſe appear to him on the Hearing.</p>
            <p>But as it is manifeſtly a flagrant Breach of his Oath in a Judge, to be influenced by any Perſon on Earth, againſt the real Merits of the Cauſe depending before him, ſo it is very repugnant to the whole Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of our Laws, which exclude even the King himſelf (with great Reverence I ſay it) from any Favour or Reſpect, where it interferes with Juſtice, and the Oaths of the Judges. For tho' His Majeſty has, by His Prerogative, divers Privileges in his Courts, in Point of Pleading and the like, yet it is allowed, and ſo it has often been ruled, that the Judges, who are neither to deny, or to delay Juſtice, ought not to obey His Royal Commands, if illegal, tho' they come under his Broad or private Seal, Writs, Letters, Meſſages, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Of this, there is a remarkable Inſtance in the Reign of the renouned Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which I ſhall the rather cite at large, becauſe it is a noble Precedent of the inflexible Probity of the Judges in thoſe Days, and cannot be too much admired, or too often ſet in View, as it may be a good Example to all other Magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>The Queen, in the 25th Year of her Reign, was pleaſed to erect a new Office in the Common-Pleas, which ſhe grants to <hi>Richard Cavendiſh,</hi> whom ſhe ſends to have admitted, but the Judges delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the doing it, becauſe they knew the Prothonotaries of the Court claimed a prior Right to the iſſuing the Writs for which the Office was erected: The Queen then ſends a ſharp Letter, commanding them forthwith to admit <hi>Cavendiſh,</hi> but the Judges ſtill forbore; whereupon, ſhe wrote a ſharper Letter, requiring them to ſhew the Reaſons of ſuch their Contempt, to the Lord-Keeper, and the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and they accordingly ſignify'd their Reaſons as above; which not ſatisfying the Queen, her Majeſty ſends a fourth peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Meſſage, adding withal by way of Inducement, that if the others were put out, they were rich Men, and her Courts were open,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:006015_0010_1027755E89E74F10"/>
where they might demand, and make out their Right. To this the Judges humbly return'd the following Anſwer: <hi>That the Queen had taken her Oath for the Execution of Juſtice according to Law; that they did not doubt but, when her Majeſty was informed that it was againſt Law, ſee wou'd do what befitted her. For their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>urts, they had taken an Oath to God, to her, and the Common wealth; and if they ſhould do it without Proceſs of Law before them, and, only upon her Command put the others out of Poſſeſſion, tho' the Right remained in them, it were a Breach of their Oaths; and therefore, if the Fear of God were not ſufferred, the Puniſhment that was inflicted upon th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <p>To conclude this Head. As a knowing and upright Judge, or Magiſtrate, is an amiable Character, and merits the Eſteem of every Body, ſo a ſcandalouſly ignorant, or a groſly corrupt Perſon arm'd with Authority, is the moſt deſpicable, or moſt odious Character in Life; the one excites the Contempt, and the other, the Deteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all his Fellow-Creatures: By the Want of Capacity, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is a Diſhonour to thoſe that rais'd him to the Station; and, by the Want of Honeſty, the latter is a Diſgrace to Human Nature itſelf; the one has it not in his Power to do the Duty of his Office, nor the other, the Will; the firſt, therefore, may in ſome Meaſure deſerve Pity, but the laſt deſerves nothing better than a Halter.</p>

               </gap>gn Puniſhment. I will now conſider <hi>Oaths</hi> with a Regard to thoſe who are called upon to offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in that Capacity.</p>
            <p>The Trial by twelve Men is a very antient Inſtitution, and has been continued down thro' a Succeſſion of Ages as one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Priviledges of <hi>Engliſhmen:</hi> not is it uſed in any other Country whatever. But the Excellency thereof notwithſtanding depends al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together upon the reaſonable Preſumption there is, that ſuch a Number of Men fairly returned of the Vicinity, will honeſtly and faithfully diſcharge their Duty. To which find, all who ſerve upon Juries, whether they are of the Grand Inqueſt for publick Offences, or of the Petty Jury, either in Civil or Criminal Caſes, are firſt obliged to take an Oath in open Court, ſuited to the Nature
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:006015_0012_102775635D28B8C0"/>
of the Buſineſs they are entering upon, and purporting a ſolemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to do it with the utmoſt Impartiality. And tho' this is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be ſtrictly binding on the Jurors, <hi>God having</hi> (as Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>Tillotſon</hi> obſerves) <hi>planted in the Natural Conſciences of Men a ſecret Dread of Perjury above moſt other Sins,</hi> yet they are not left in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to the Guidance of their own Conſciences in reſpect thereto; for notwithſtanding the Fear of incurring the Divine Diſpleaſure may, and undoubted will reſtrain every good Chriſtian from viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Oath, the Wiſdom of our Laws has deem'd it expedient to ſubject the Offenders in many Reſpects to Temporal Puniſhments alſo, of which none ought to be ignorant.</p>
            <p>Thus, they are liable to be fin'd at the Diſcretion of the Court, for Miſdemeanours of divers Kinds, all which are more or leſs in Breach of their Oath. And by the Stat. 34. <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap</hi> 8. If any Juror take a Reward to give his Verdict, and be thereof attainted at the Suit of other than the Party, and maketh Fine, he that ſueth ſhall have half the Fine and, if any of the Parties to the Plea bring his Action againſt ſuch Juror, he ſhall recover his Damages, and the Juror ſo attainted ſhall have Impriſonment for one Year. So by 5 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 8. If any Juror in Affixes, Juries or Inqueſts, take of the one Party or the other, and be thereof duly attainted, he ſhall not hereafter be put into Affixes, Juries, or Inqueſts, but ſhall be commanded to Priſon, and further ranſom'd at the King's Will. And by the 38 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 12. Every one of the Jurors ſhall pay Ten Times as much as he hath taken, otherwiſe be impriſoned for a Year. Upon this Statute the Writ of <hi>Decies tantum</hi> will lie, and may be brought by any one, where any of the Jurors, after he is ſworn, take of the one Party or the other a Reward to give his Verdict, even if they give a true Verdict, or no Verdict at all. But where a falſe Verdict is given by a Jury, in a Civil Caſe, the Party grieved may bring his Writ of <hi>Attaint.</hi> And ſo odious is this Kind of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury in the Eye of the Common Law, that the Judgment therein is even ſhocking to repeat, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that they loſe <hi>liberam legem</hi> for ever, <hi>i. e.</hi> be ſo infamous as never to be received as a Witneſs, or to be of any Jury. That they ſhall forfeit all their Goods and Chattels. That their Lands and Tenements ſhall be taken into the King's Hands. That their Wives and Children ſhall be thrown out of Doors. That their Houſes ſhall be razed and pull'd down. That their Trees ſhall be rooted up. That their Meadow Grounds
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006015_0013_1027756A17B5FDF8"/>
ſhall be ploughed up. That their Bodies ſhall be caſt into Goal, and the Party be reſtored to all that he loſt, by reaſon of the unjuſt Verdict. 'Tis true, the Severity of this Puniſhment is moderated in ſome Particulars by the Statute of 23d. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Cap</hi> 3. but the Writ may ſtill be brought at Common Law, as well as upon the Statute.</p>
            <p>Theſe Methods of Proceedings againſt <hi>Jurors</hi> and <hi>Juries</hi> are, it muſt be acknowledged, but ſeldom put in Practice, and it is indeed aſtoniſhing that there ſhould ever be an Occaſion for them at all, ſince as a worthy Divine of our Church has it: <hi>All Partiality of Verdicts is a ſolemn Evil; it is a Breach both of Truth and Truſt, and an implicit Defiance of the Chriſtian Faith, which is there pligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and pawned as a Pledge of Integrity.</hi> Leaving human Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then out of the Queſtion, and admitting they may be eſcaped, what Satisfaction or Peace of Mind can a Man expect, or what Quiet within his own Breaſt, who having ſolemnly taken the Oath as above, is yet conſcious to himſelf that, in giving a Verdict on any Trial, he was not guided by the Truth of Facts as they appeared in Evidence, but that he was biaſſed by Hatred or Affection, Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice or Paſſion, and induced by Hope or Fear (and perhaps from the ſame Motive induced others) to condemn or acquit the Party in a Criminal Caſe, or to find for the Plaintiff or Defendant in a Civil One? Is it poſſible for one who believes a Word of our Holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to eat, drink, or ſleep, or perform the common Offices of Life with any Comfort, after he has ſo offended? Surely if he can, or does, the Weight of his Torments and the Horrors of his Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be more grievous hereafter.</p>
            <p>I come now, in Courſe, to ſpeak of the Oaths of <hi>Witneſſes.</hi> As the Jury are ſworn to <hi>return their Verdict according to the Evidence,</hi> ſo the Witneſſes are ſworn to <hi>declare the Truth, the whole Truth, and nothing but the Truth;</hi> and as the former therefore are not to blame, if they find according to the Evidence, altho' the Evidence proves to be falſe, unleſs they know the Fact to be otherwiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (and, where any one of them does, he ought to be ſworn to give Evidence to his Brother Jurors) ſo if the latter give a falſe Teſtimony, they are guilty of Perjury in the ſtricteſt and legal Senſe of the Word. But, before I ſpeak of the Laws relating to this Offence, I cannot forbear citing the Opinion of the celebrated Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop above-mentioned, concerning it. He tells us, that <q>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006015_0014_1027756D1809EA58"/>
Perjury being directly againſt a Man's Knowledge, no Man can commit it without ſtaring his Conſcience in the race, which is one of the greateſt Aggravations of any Crime. And it is equally a Sin againſt both Tables, being the higheſt Affront to God, and of the moſt injurious Conſequences to Men. It is an horrible Abuſe of the Name of God, an open Contempt of his Judgments, and an inſolent Defiance of his Vengeance. And in reſpect of Men, it is not only a Wrong to this or that particular Perſon who ſuffers by it, but Treaſon againſt human Society, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting at once the Foundations of publick Peace and Juſtice, and the private Security of every Mans Life and Fortune. It is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feating of the beſt and laſt Way that the Wiſdom of Men could deviſe for the Deciſion of doubtful Matters.</q> So far that great and good Man, whoſe Sentiments cannot fail to make the deepeſt Impreſſion on all that duly weigh them.</p>
            <p>But Perjury is one of thoſe Crimes which our Laws look upon as infamous and groſly ſcandalous, proceeding from Principles of downright Diſhoneſty; and by the Old Laws of <hi>England,</hi> we learn it was puniſhed by Death, and afterwards by cutting out of the Tongue. At this Day there is Perjury at Common Law, and by the Stat. of 5 <hi>Eliz. Cap</hi> 9. Perjury by the Common Law has been defined to be a wilful falſe Oath by one who, being lawfully requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to depoſe the Truth in any Proceeding in a Court of Juſtice, ſwears abſolutely in a Matter of ſome Conſequence to the Point in Queſtion, whether he be believed or not. The Puniſhment on a Conviction at Common Law is pretty much left to the Prudence of the Court, being generally Corporal, with ſuch Fine and Lien to the good Behaviour for a certain Time as ſhall ſeem moſt agreeable to the Nature and Circumſtances of the Offence. The Statute, tho' it reſtrains the Offence to the particular Caſes therein ſpecify'd, yet it adds to the Puniſhment. For, by that, the Perſon only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed or attainted ſhall forfeit 20 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> be impriſoned ſix Months with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Bail or Mainprize, diſabled from being a Witneſs; and if he have not Goods or Chatties to the Value of 20 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> be put in the Pillory, and have both Ears nailed. Yet it is allowed, and inferred, from a Proviſo in the Statute (<hi>Par.</hi> 13.) that the Court of King's Bench, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> proceeding upon Indictment or Information of Perjury at Common Law, may not only ſet a diſcretionary Fine on the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006015_0015_1027757026F81AD0"/>
Offender, but alſo condemn him to the Pillory, without making any Inquiry concerning his Goods.</p>
            <p>There are, however, innumerable Caſes wherein Perſons may be guilty of Perjury without incurring the Penalties of the Law, and which, being impoſſible for human Skill to provide againſt, muſt neceſſarily be left to another Judicature, from whoſe All ſeeing Eve nothing can be hid, and who will be avenged on thoſe that are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in his due Time. Thus, for Example, if a Man be called upon to give his Teſtimony concerning a Civil or Criminal Matter, and he, in Order to ſcreen or convict the Party, or to procure a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict in Favour of his Friend, or againſt one whom he ſecretly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, will in the Courſe of his Evidence make Uſe of any Arts to deceive; or, by Means of the Influence he may have, endeavour to miſlead the Jury, and to carry them away from the Point before them, by ſuggeſting a Thing, perhaps, that may be true in one Senſe, and falſe in another, and making them believe it in the former, or the like; altho' he may expreſs himſelf in ſuch Terms as to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the Imputation of having ſworn directly falſe, he is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding guilty of the Crime we are ſpeaking of to a high Degree. For my own Part, I confeſs I ſhould be more upon my Guard with ſuch a Man than with another whoſe Ears have been actually nailed to the Pillory, and in my private Judgment think him as infamous. —But, inſtead of multiplying Inſtances of this Nature. I will cite a Paſſage from the ſame venerable Prelate to whom I have had Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe more than once already, and which as it is applicable to any that can happen, ſo it may be a very good Leſſon to ſuch as are leſs anxious of the <hi>Truth</hi> in their Evidence, than of keeping themſelves out of the <hi>Crown-Office.</hi> 
               <q>This, <hi>ſays he,</hi> may be laid down as a certain Rule, that all Departure from the Simplicity of an Oath, is a Degree of Perjury, and a Man is never a whit the leſs forſworn, becauſe his Perjury is a little finer and more artificial than ordinary; and tho' Men think by this Device to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves harmleſs from the Guilt of ſo great a Sin, they do really encreaſe it by adding to their Iniquity the impudent Folly of mocking God, and deceiving themſelves.</q>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis now Time that I paſs on to the Oaths of Civil or Miniſterial Officers; but as they are many of them, as well as others, obliged to take what are commonly called the <hi>State-Oaths,</hi> without any particular Oath of Office, I will firſt hint a few Things relating
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:006015_0016_10277571B9B5F4D0"/>
thereto, and which I preſume will not be wholly unneceſſary even on this Side the Globe. Theſe Oaths then are demanded by the Government from its reſpective Members, as a Security for their Fidelity and Allegiance; and the impoſing of them is grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the indiſputable Right which every State has to preſerve itſelf, and to uſe all proper Methods for its own Defence, it being highly reaſonable that every Man who lives in, and receives the Benefits of a Regulated Community, ſhall likewiſe be under ſome <hi>Tye</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the general Intereſt of the Whole, which in a great Meaſure depends on the Life and Safety of the Supreme Magiſtrate. Thoſe therefore that refuſe to give ſuch Security which it is in the Power of all to give (and which was never more juſtly due than to his preſent Majeſty) do in Effect renounce the Advantages, and bid Defiance to the Laws of that Society whereof they are Members, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently muſt be looked upon as Enemies to it. But as theſe Men are liable to be dealt with according to the Laws, and ſometimes their Scruples may poſſibly be truly conſcientious, ariſing from miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken Notions they may have imbibed by a wrong Education, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend they are leſs dangerous, as well as more excuſable than ſuch as will take the Oaths with their Lips only, and in Order to enable them the better to diſturb and injure the Adminiſtration they ſwear to defend. We know indeed but of <hi>one</hi> Religion which countenances ſuch Practices in its Votaries, and that is a very great Reproach to Chriſtianity; and how much ſoever they may be prevailed on to believe in the Force or Validity of a <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> from their <hi>Head,</hi> or what Security ſoever they may derive to themſelves from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Conſideration, one may venture to pronounce that, if the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> came to eſtabliſh upon the Earth be true, that which allows of ſuch a Practice muſt be falſe; far it can't be deny'd, but, if a Perſon promiſes upon Oath what he does not intend to perform, he is guilty of Perjury in the very Act of Swearing. Nor is there any Reaſon therefore to doubt but Men who can ſatisfy their Conſciences, in doing, in the Inſtance before us, what is ſo apparently contrary to natural Juſtice, will find out ſpecious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences for defrauding their Neighbour, or committing any other Crime which their Paſſions may prompt them, or their Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Inclinations lead them to. No Wonder then if ſuch ſhould occaſionally put others upon, or encourage them in a Breach of their Duty and their Oath, who have themſelves ſo little Regard thereto in their own Conduct!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:006015_0017_10277575412F0250"/>As to the Oaths of Officers, they are various, and ſuited to the different Natures of their reſpective Offices, which they are ſworn no execute according to the Rules preſcribed them. It would be too tedious to enumerate the ſeveral Officers we have amongſt us, or deſcend to Particulars relating to them, and therefore what I ſhall ſay will be general, and the rather becauſe I would, above all Things, avoid Offence, having no Deſign in the leaſt to make Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Reflections of any Kind. Now the Oath taken by Officers, publick or private, being of the <hi>Premiſſary</hi> Kind, to which expreſs and judicial Perjury does not extend, they are not, 'tis true, indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for that Crime in reſpect of ſuch Oath; however, as they may be proſecuted for Extortion and other Breaches of their Duty, ſo the Offence will be greatly aggravated by being contrary to their Oath, and they liable to the ſeverer Fine on that Account.</p>
            <p>But the incomparable <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> ſo often quoted, obſerves, that <q>For the Faithful Diſcharge of Offices of great Truſt in which the Welfare of the Publick is nearly concerned, it is not poſſible to find any Security equal to that of an Oath, becauſe the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that reacheth to the moſt ſecret and hidden Practice of Men, and takes hold of them in many Caſes where the Penalty of no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Law can have any Awe or Force upon them.</q> If Perſons then in ſuch high Employments were but rightly to conſider the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Nature of an Oath, and the Duty they owe the Publick, how cautious would they be in their Conduct! how circumſpect in their Actions! and what Benefits would accrue to Mankind thereby! But it, on the other Hand, they will conſider their Oath meerly as a Thing of Courſe, and what they are obliged to take in Compliance with the Laws only, it cannot be ſurprizing to find them on all Occaſions conſulting their own Paſſions and Prejudices, and aiming at their own private Intereſt, inſtead of purſuing that of the Publick, for which alone they were placed in thoſe elevated Stations. Some Difficulties may indeed ariſe and Caſes happen wherein a wiſe and a good Man may be at a Loſs how to behave; but then he will, no doubt, and ought to take the beſt Advice he can get, not be precipitate in his Determinations, but apply to thoſe who are beſt able, and, according to the Nature of the Affair, moſt likely to give the wholſomeſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. To apply to others, is only making a Shew of being willing to do what is right, and the readieſt Way to be led to do that which is wrong; for ſuch, as are known to have private and ſiniſter Views of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006015_0018_10277579AE3B57A8"/>
their own, are not likely to forward any Thing that is for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good, but will ever incline to Sacrifice it as often as it is in their Power, and it ſtands in the Way of their Intereſt, or the Schemes they have laid to ſupport or agrandize themſelves.</p>
            <p>I muſt obſerve here, that Virtue and Vice, Good and Evil, are for the moſt Part very diſtinguiſhable, and I am perſwaded there is no one of common Underſtanding, but feels either Pain or Pleaſure, Uneaſineſs or Satisfaction, as he is conſcious of having done one or the other; and this is certain, that as often as a ſworn Officer wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and knowingly acts contrary to his Duty, he is more or leſs guilty of forſwearing himſelf in Proportion to the aggravating Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances with which the Fact is attended. Whether then we reſpect the immediate Officers of the Crown, or ſuch as are concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Aid of the Magiſtrate in Courts of Judicature, or in the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Laws without Doors, how ſhocking is it to ſee any of them partial and unjuſt, cruel and revengeful, proud and arrogant; ready to do that for one which they will abſolutely deny to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, tho' both have an equal Right; <hi>ſtrain at Gnats</hi> in ſome Caſes, and <hi>ſwallow Camels,</hi> in others; be in the Way at all Hours to oblige ſome Perſons in what ought not to be done, and be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely out of the Way to avoid doing what others may legally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; extort the uttermoſt Farthing from ſome, and connive at Abuſes and Miſapplications in others; repreſenting one Man's Caſe in the moſt favourable Light, and that of another in the moſt odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; artfully protecting ſome from the Hands of Juſtice, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be puniſhed, and rigorouſly proſecuting others that ought to be ſpared, or have not really offended. Theſe, and ſuch like Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as they are unjuſt in themſelves, ſo they are infinitely the more heinous for being done in Violation of a ſolemn Oath to the contrary.</p>
            <p>It ſhould be remembered, that all <hi>Offices</hi> were originally inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the Conveniency of the People in general, and not to ſerve ſome, and oppreſs others, according to the Liking or Ill-Will of the Perſons that are in them. How agreeable a Sight then is it to behold Gentlemen in Offices of Truſt, who by a ſteady and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Behaviour are an Honour to their Poſts, and a real Benefit to the Publick; who are not capable of being cajolled, bully'd, or brib'd out of their Duty, but will inflexibly adhere to it on all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences, and in every Situation? Who will not proſtitute their
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:006015_0019_1027757CA4C36C38"/>
Places to the Service of a Party or Faction; or make them meerly ſubſervient to that of Friends and Dependants? Who will, for the Eaſe of the Country, even decline purſuing what may greatly tend to their own Advantage, tho' it be lawful, when there is a Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of promoting the Publick Peace, and attaining a general Good thereby? And who, in a Word, will, throughout their whole Conduct, conſider what ought to be done and not what they could wiſh, or particular Perſons may deſire to have done. Such Officers do indeed anſwer the true End of their being made ſo, they will deſerve the Eſteem, and have the good Wiſhes of all honeſt Men; and whatever Abuſes they may receive from others (whoſe Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions probably depend on the Confuſions and Diſturbances that happen in Government) they will, I dare ſay, enjoy a conſtant inward Pleaſure more than ſufficient to compenſate ſuch Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>But as my chief Deſign was to ſtir up in the Minds of People, of all Ranks and Conditions, a due Senſe of the binding Nature of an <hi>Oath,</hi> and to ſhew the Uſefulneſs thereof, and how dangerous the contrary is to Society, for which Purpoſe I began my Letter with the judicious Obſervation of a noted Foreigner, I will now ſubjoin the Suffrage of an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> diſtinguiſhed for fine Senſe and good Literature, as the late <hi>Walter Moyle,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> undoubtedly was: <q>When <hi>ſays he,</hi> we have loſt all Reſpect for the Obligation of Oaths, there is an End of all our Courts of Judicature, we have no other Way to judge of Right or Wrong, Truth or Falſhood, nor any Security left us for our Lives and Property, when the Reverence for that ſolemn Appeal to Almighty God is once ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed in our Minds.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have finiſhed what I had to offer on the preſent Subject, which I choſe to handle in an uſeful rather than elegant Manner, accommodating the whole as much as poſſible to our own Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; and I wiſh it may prove of that Service which ſome very worthy Perſons were willing to make me believe they would.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAVING read lately your Two Letters concerning Oaths, wherein you give the Sentiments of honeſt <hi>Heathens</hi> as well as <hi>Proteſtant Chriſtians,</hi> on that Subject, I was thereby led to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect what I had formerly met with of a quite different Tendency, from ſome of the Writings of a very learned Body of Men who are pleaſed to ſtile themſelves <hi>of the Society of Jeſus,</hi> and would conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be thought, no doubt, to be, in a peculiar Reſpect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fautors of that pure Religion, which was inſtituted by the Divine Perſon whoſe Name they aſſume. Whether they are really ſo, or not, may beſt appear from the Doctrine they teach, and openly avow in the Inſtances hereafter mentioned, to each of which I ſhall ſubjoin a Reference to the Book from whence it is faithfully tranſlated.</p>
            <p>I will begin with <hi>Filliucius:</hi> who was a famous Caſuiſt, and the Pope's Penitentiary. <q>The Man, <hi>ſays he,</hi> who has externally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed any Thing, but without an Intention of performing, being aſked whether he made ſuch a Promiſe, may deny it, meaning to himſelf, that he did not make a Promiſe that was binding; nay, he may even <hi>ſwear</hi> to it, otherwiſe he might be urged to pay what he doth not owe.</q>

            <p>
               <hi>Tambourin</hi> out-goes his Brother <hi>Filliucius,</hi> for he excuſes thoſe from keeping their Word and Oath, who even make a Doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they intended to oblige themſelves to keep ſuch Word, or ſuch Oath. <q>Tho' you are ſure, <hi>ſays he,</hi> that you have made a Vow or an Oath, 'tis probable, in my Opinion, that you are not bound by it, if you doubt whether you had an Intention to oblige your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſtand to it.</q> 
               <hi>Tambour. in Decal.</hi> L. 1. c. 3 §. 7. n. 6.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Valentia</hi> goes ſtill farther than the other two. He is of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, <q>That, tho' you make a Promiſe with an Intention of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obliged to it, the Obligation does not take Effect, provided there was no Deſign to perform the Thing promiſed; becauſe, <hi>ſays he,</hi> the Vow becomes void, if you have no Will to put it in Execution.</q>

               <hi>Sanchez,</hi> another worthy and well qualify'd Member of this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, teaches, that <q>When one goes to ſwear, or is preſſed to take an Oath, to ſay <hi>Uro,</hi> I burn, inſtead of <hi>juro,</hi> I ſwear, which, <hi>ſays he,</hi> whether you burn or not, would be but a venial Lye at moſt.</q> 
               <hi>Sanch.</hi> L. iii. c. 6. n. 37. And again, <q>If a Man ſhould ſwear that he has not done a Thing which in Reality he has, meaning ſome other Thing, within his own Breaſt, which he has not done, or ſome other Day than that alledged for the Thing done, he is neither perjured, nor a Lyar.</q> He adds, <q>This, <hi>ſays he,</hi> is mighty convenient to hide many Things: But the juſt Cauſe of making Uſe of ſuch Ambiguities, is as often as 'tis neceſſary or uſeful for the Defence of one's Perſon, Honour, or Eſtate; ſo a Man may lawfully ſay, he did not kill <hi>Peter;</hi> meaning pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately another Man of that Name, or that he did not do it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was born, <hi>Sanch. ib.</hi> n. 15. 19, and 26.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not make any Reflections on this hopeful Specimen of Caſuiſtical Divinity, but only cite what the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> very modeſtly ſay of their Society in general, and ſubmit it whether it be any Thing leſs than they deſerve. <q>It was chiefly for the Honour of our Society that the wiſe Man ſays in the 9th Chapter of his Proverbs, <hi>Wiſdom hath built her Houſe, and hewn cut her ſeven Pillars.</hi> For may we not with Reaſon call that the Houſe of Wiſdom, on the Front whereof the eternal Wiſdom of God was pleaſed to engrave his Name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the Name he aſſumed when he converſed in this World? If you aſk now where are the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, I will tell you, that Perſons of great Note, and even the Sovereign Pontiffs, have declared a long Time ago, that God had raiſed up this Society to be the Support of the Church in thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable Times.—Therefore I may venture, yea, undoubtedly, I may be allowed, without Arrogance, to aſcribe to the HUMBLE Society of <hi>Jeſus</hi> that Oracle which the Prophet-King publiſhed of <hi>Sion,</hi> that is to ſay, of the Church of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>I was the rather induced to addreſs this to you, Sir, from a Hint I obſerved in your 2d Letter, that you know but of one Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that countenances prevaricating with an Oath, in its Votaries, and I think what is here thrown together ſufficiently proves that the

            <p>THE firſt Attempt to live in Society, and to form Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, was a very bold Undertaking; and we find the Poets have accordingly feigned, that when Men firſt began to enter into, and make a Common-wealth, JUSTICE came down from Heaven with a Sword in her Hand, threatening the Wicked, and puniſhing the Profligate Members; otherwiſe, nothing but Murders and continual Devaſtations would have enſued. But, without being obliged to Fiction, it is certain that Juſtice is allowed by all to be a Divine Virtue, and thoſe that have the Diſtribution of it, as we learn from ſacred Writ, derive their Power from the Almighty himſelf, through the Hands of the Prince who entruſts them with it. <hi>Let every Soul be ſubject unto the higher Powers. For there is no Power but of God. The Powers that be, are ordained of God. Whoſoever therefore reſiſteth the Power, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God For ye judge not for Men but for the Lord, who is with you in the Judgment.</hi> They would do well therefore all of them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Words in the Wiſdom of <hi>Solomon. For Power is given you of the Lord, and Sovereignty from the Higheſt, who ſhall try your Works, and ſearch out your Councils. Becauſe being Miniſters of his Kingdom you have not judged aright, nor kept the Law, nor walked after the Council of God. Horribly and ſpeedily ſhall he come upon you; for a ſharp Judgment ſhall be to them that be in high Places. For Mercy will ſoon pardon the meaneſt; but mighty Men ſhall be mightily tormented.</hi>

               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:006015_0023_102775871D56D188"/>By the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſtitution, one of the beſt in the World, the executive Power is lodged in the King, who is obliged by his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation Oath to provide proper Officers for the due Execution of Juſtice, in the ſeveral Courts eſtabliſhed by Law for that Purpoſe; and he is himſelf vertually preſent in all of them, and ſuppoſed to be ſpeaking in Perſon in the Words at the Head of this Paper. WE WILL NOT SELL JUSTICE, WE WILL NOT DENY JUSTICE, WE WILL NOT DELAY JUSTICE TO ANY ONE. A Noble Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! And to which every Subject, the meaneſt as well as the greateſt, has an equal Right! A Right moreover, that is founded on the firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Baſis! For as the <hi>Great Charter,</hi> wherein it is expreſſed, has been confirmed, eſtabliſhed, and commanded by 32 Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> who makes that Obſervation, aſſures us likewiſe, that it is only declaratory of the Fundamental Grounds of the Common Law, and no more than a Confirmation or Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Privileges which were previouſly claimed, and doe thereby. 'Tis on this Account, that the Crime of unjuſt Judges has been thought to be aggravated, in Regard that their evil Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices tend, in ſome Meaſure, to make the King himſelf violate his Oath to his People.</p>
            <p>I have often fancied it might be of good Service towards preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting very flagrant Inſtances of this Kind, if the Oath taken by the Judges of every Court were to be ſet up in Capital Letters, in the reſpective Places where they fit. It would undoubtedly be a great Satisfaction to the Suiters, and probably of Uſe too to ſome of the Judges themſelves, whoſe Memory might not always retain the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of what they have ſworn, perhaps ſeveral Years before.</p>
            <p>If it be conſider'd how frail the Nature of Man is, how liable to Paſſions and Prejudices, and how ſurrounded with Temptations of various Kinds; in a Word, that <hi>we are prone to do Evil, as the Sparks fly upwards,</hi> it muſt be allow'd, I think, that there cannot be too many Barriers againſt Injuſtice, nor too much Precaution uſed in tying up the Hands of Magiſtrates from committing it. What I hinted, therefore, concerning the Oaths of our Judges, will not, I preſume, appear altogether unreaſonable or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper; nor can it poſſibly give Offence to ſuch as mean to act wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of their Character. As they have already vouched the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty for their Behaviour, they do not care how many of his Creatures are Witneſſes to it; and, as they fully intend to make
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:006015_0024_1027758A5D6EDDC8"/>
good their Engagements to the Omniſcient, they are not in the leaſt averſe to the giving all other Security, that may be deem'd requiſite.</p>
            <p>But as my Deſire is not ſo much to exclaim againſt bad Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, as to recommend, promote, and encourage good Ones, I ſhall cite, here, the Advice given by the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Coke</hi> to thoſe of his Time, and who were to come after him, which may be ſeen at the End of his <hi>Fourth Inſtitutes.</hi> 
               <q>You Honourable and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend read Judges and juſtices <hi>(ſays he)</hi> that do or ſhall ſit in the high Tribunals and Courts, or Seats of Juſtice, fear not to do Right to all, and to deliver your Opinion according to the Laws; for Fear is nothing but a betraying of the Succours that Reaſon ſhould afford. And, if you ſhall ſincerely execute Juſtice, be aſſured of Three Things: Firſt, tho' ſome may malign you, yet God will give you his Bleſſing. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That, though thereby you may offend great Men and Favourites, yet you ſhall have the favourable Kindneſs of the Almighty, and be his Favourites; and <hi>Laſtly,</hi> That in ſo doing, againſt all ſcandalous Complaints and pragmatical Devices againſt you, God will defend you as with a Should: <hi>For thou, Lord, will give Bleſſing to the Righteous, and with thy favourable Kindneſs wilt thus defend him as with a Shield.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>After all, I hope it will not be thought neceſſary that I ſhould make an Apology for the Freedom I have us'd in theſe my Letters, when I declare that I was prompted thereto meerly by the Love of Juſtice, and an honeſt Deſire of promoting it, without the leaſt Prejudice againſt the Perſons of any that are at preſent in Authority here. All therefore I ſhall ſay is, that if there ſhould be ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt, as are conſcious to themſelves of having been hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to leſs circumſpect than the Nature of their Office requires (with which I am far from charging them) they will do well to be more obſervant for the future. As I envy none of them their Poſts, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would I willingly make them, nor indeed ought they to be made uneaſy therein, while they endeavour to act ſuitable to their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Characters, according to the beſt of their Knowledge. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude then, and as a Proof of my unfeigned Regards, I heartily wiſh for their own Sakes, and the Sake of the Publick, they may always feel that inward Satisfaction and Peace of Mind which never fails to attend the <hi>Teſtimony of a good Conſcience,</hi> and which is a Pleaſure I am, for my own Part, folly ſatisfy'd nothing elſe can afford.</p>
