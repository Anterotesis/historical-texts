            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>But after all, The <hi>Grace</hi> and the <hi>Gift by Grace</hi> here ſpoken of, is neither more nor leſs than the particular Grace of <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Liberality</hi> to the Poor and Needy; an enlarged Heart and open Hand to relieve and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them in their Wants and Neceſſities. — The whole <hi>Chapter</hi> is on this ſingle <hi>Subject</hi> and Argument, touching <hi>Miniſtring to the Saints,</hi> v. 1. <hi>as a Maſter of Bounty,</hi> v. 5. <hi>ſowing bountifully,</hi> v. 7. <hi>giving to the Poor,</hi> v. 9 <hi>ſupplying the Wants of Saints,</hi> v. 12. <hi>liberal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution to all Men:</hi> This is the <hi>exceeding Grace</hi> and <hi>unſpeakable Gift,</hi> for which <hi>Thanks</hi> is here given to God.</p>
            <p>And great is the <hi>Honour and Glory</hi> done it, in the <hi>Epithet</hi> UNSPEAKABLE, and in the THANKSGIVING to God for it.</p>
            <p>"<hi>Who can by ſearching find out</hi> GOD, or any <hi>Gift</hi> of His, <hi>unto Perfection?</hi> Who can <hi>ſhew forth all his Praiſe?</hi> All is comprehended in the one Word LOVE.

Nevertheleſs it muſt be added, that <hi>Love</hi> in this particular <hi>Mode</hi> and Miniſtration, of which my <hi>Text</hi> ſpeaks, will <hi>ſoon fail;</hi> for there are no Objects of <hi>Charity</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> none <hi>poor</hi> or <hi>needy</hi> there: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, <hi>Benevolence,</hi> the Soul and <hi>Eſſence</hi> of Charity, <hi>reigns</hi> there in Glory for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>Bleſſed be GOD that we have <hi>ſomething</hi> and ſo <hi>much</hi> of it on <hi>Earth,</hi> in our <hi>Way</hi> to Heaven: "<hi>Thanks</hi> to <hi>Him</hi> for it, ſays my <hi>Text.</hi> The Glory is <hi>God</hi>'s, for it is

               <hi>his</hi> Gift, &amp; this is the Glory of the Gift that it is <hi>his;</hi> this makes it the <hi>unſpeakable</hi> thing it is: Divine, Heavenly, Infinite, in its Origine, Influence and endleſs Effects.</p>
            <p>GOD is the free and bountiful <hi>Author</hi> of this Grace in any, He <hi>gives</hi> it to Thoſe that have it; the Ability and the Heart to do kind and liberal Things is from <hi>Him;</hi> He puts it into the Heart, and he enlarges it. "Even Power to <hi>eat</hi> our Bread is from Him, how much more to <hi>give</hi> of it to <hi>others,</hi> to <hi>ſeven</hi> and alſo to <hi>eight</hi>

            <p>The <hi>liberal Man</hi> is God's Gift to the World; to the <hi>Place</hi> where he lives, to <hi>diſtant</hi> Places alſo, if he have a Hand full and <hi>ſtrong</hi> eno' to ſcatter far and near. Some in the Churches of <hi>Macedonia</hi> were thus made to <hi>differ</hi> and excel: God miniſtred <hi>ſeed</hi> to them and they ſowed plentifully; God <hi>curiched</hi> them unto all Bountifulneſs, and the <hi>Thankſgiving</hi> was abundant to God.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Praiſe</hi> is not to the charitable Perſon, who <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes</hi> the liberal Things, but to <hi>God</hi> who gives him the Heart. The good Man will be <hi>far</hi> from taking any of the Praiſe to himſelf, but to <hi>God's Name</hi> he gives the Glory. "<hi>It is not in me,</hi> ſaid the Princely <hi>Joſeph,</hi> when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> asked him of the <hi>unſpeakable Gift</hi> he heard was in him; "<hi>God ſhall give Pharaob an Anſwer of Peace</hi>

<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004352_0007_10044932EA9AF798"/>and my <hi>Context</hi> confines me to <hi>this</hi> Conſideration of it, "as the <hi>Grace of God beſtowed on the Churches,</hi> and the <hi>Fellowſhip of miniſtring to the Saints.</hi> So that a <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> in the Heart, and the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of it in the Life, are here ſuppoſed: That is to ſay, a giving to the poor and needy from <hi>Faith in Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Word,</hi> from <hi>Love</hi> to Him and his <hi>People,</hi> upon the <hi>Commandment</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi> of the Goſpel; in <hi>Obedience</hi> to the one, and <hi>Hope</hi> in the other.</p>
            <p>It is not therefore meerly a <hi>humane,</hi> tender, generous <hi>natural Temper,</hi> or <hi>acquired</hi> Diſpoſition towards a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous or compaſſionable Object; and yet <hi>this</hi> is a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing <hi>Gift</hi> of Providence to ſome more than others, which renders 'em more <hi>lovely</hi> and of a ſuperior Spirit; but we muſt ſuppoſe a Soul of this Diſpoſition <hi>ſanctified,</hi> and acting upon religious <hi>Principles and Motives;</hi> or one of <hi>another</hi> Diſpoſition <hi>changed</hi> by the Power of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace into <hi>this;</hi> and then what rais'd and <hi>enobled</hi> Souls do the one and other become? <hi>all their Things being done with Charity!</hi> from a reigning Love to God and Goodneſs as ſuch, as there is Opportunity unto <hi>all Men,</hi> but eſpecially unto the <hi>Houſhold of Faith,</hi> proving their Love before the <hi>Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Caſe a ſpecial Exerciſe of proper Evangelical <hi>Faith</hi> with <hi>Love</hi> is ſuppoſed, as in the <hi>Frame</hi> of Spirit, ſo in the choſen <hi>Objects,</hi> poor <hi>Saints</hi> and Members of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> for <hi>His</hi> ſake, and as unto <hi>Him,</hi> and as He will accept and reward another Day; "<hi>Ye did it unto Me.</hi> This is <hi>Chriſt form'd in us,</hi> his Spirit ruling in us, a <hi>new Nature</hi> given to us, acting in new Manner, on new Principles, Ends and Motives; ſuch as the meer <hi>natural</hi> Man perceives not, in equal or greater Benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; a <hi>Sacrifice holy and acceptable to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is <hi>eaſy</hi> to the <hi>Power</hi> of God and <hi>worthy</hi> of his <hi>Mercy,</hi> ſo to change the Heart of the naturally <hi>Niggard</hi> &amp; grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, into this <hi>Riches</hi> of Benignity and Beneficence, whereof there ſeem to have been <hi>many Inſtances</hi> in the <hi>firſt Days</hi> of the Goſpel, upon the <hi>pouring</hi> out of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> when the <hi>Multitude</hi> of them that believed were
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004352_0008_10044984B793FB48"/>of <hi>one</hi> Heart and Soul; neither ſaid <hi>any</hi> of them, that ought of the things they poſſeſſed were their <hi>own,</hi> but they bad all things <hi>common,</hi> Acts iv. <hi>ult.</hi> An <hi>extraordinary</hi> Spirit of <hi>Love,</hi> at an extraordinary Time and Occaſion! a wonderful Effuſion of the HOLY GHOST, from the late crucified and aſcended JESUS. The like therefore has not been known in <hi>ordinary</hi> Times, nor is it the <hi>ſtanding</hi> Exerciſe of the <hi>Spirit</hi> in the ſanctified. But the <hi>Want</hi> of what ſhould be <hi>common</hi> among Chriſtians at <hi>all</hi> Times, is a ſad and <hi>dark</hi> Teſtimony of the <hi>Poverty</hi> of Grace; for there certainly are among us People of <hi>high Profeſſion,</hi> who have <hi>no</hi> Heart to do almoſt any thing at all, in a way of <hi>Diſtribution</hi> to the Poor, or for pious Uſes; no not a known Inſtance for Years together; while God is liberally giving to them, and they can lay up and lay out and make Purchaſes! but if you ſpeak of <hi>giving,</hi> they <hi>hide themſelves from their own Fleſh,</hi> even tho' they be eſteemed <hi>Members of Chriſt</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>Let us always ſee to it, that our <hi>Principle and End</hi> be right before God, genuine and truly <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> that neither <hi>Vanity,</hi> Affectation or Oſtentation, nor yet meer <hi>Humanity</hi> and good Nature, be <hi>paſs'd on God</hi> for gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Charity,</hi> on Whom it cannot; nor yet on <hi>Men,</hi> nor on <hi>our ſelves,</hi> which alſo is next to impoſſible under our Illuminations by the Goſpel. Wherefore our <hi>Lord,</hi> according to the infinite Wiſdom and Sanctity of God in Him, has warned us to <hi>take heed how we do our Alms,</hi> Ieſt we have no Reward from <hi>our Father in Heaven.</hi> Matth. vi.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I am now to ſhow, that this Evangelical Chriſtian <hi>charitable Frame</hi> of Spirit is an <hi>unſpeakable Gift of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Literally true it is, that <hi>no Tongue</hi> of Man can duely ſpeak of it, or enough praiſe and <hi>celebrate</hi> it. It is above all our Thoughts and Words, we can neither think or ſpeak of it as it merits. Such is every <hi>Work</hi> and Gift of God in the Kingdom of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Providence.</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:004352_0009_100441C675C1FE50"/>"See that thou <hi>magnify</hi> theſe viſible Works, which <hi>Eyes of Fleſh</hi> behold. "<hi>His Work is honourable and glorious, and his Praiſe endureth for Ever.</hi> How much more his <hi>Spiritual Work,</hi> the <hi>Gift by Grace</hi> within thy Self and Others. The <hi>Angels</hi> of God <hi>pry</hi> ſilently into <hi>this,</hi> and we need <hi>their</hi> Eyes and Tongues to look into it and ſpeak of it. "Bleſs the Lord ye his <hi>Angels</hi> that excel in Strength! and "<hi>awake up our Glory</hi> too, though we be but <hi>Babes and Sucklings</hi> in compariſon of Them; for from <hi>our</hi> Mind and Mouth God has <hi>ordained</hi> Strength.—We <hi>liſp</hi> and ſtammer at a proper Word, and poorly apprehend many of the Great Words put into our Mouth. "Let Him <hi>teach</hi> us what we ſhall ſay! and ſhall it be <hi>told</hi> Him that we ſpeak! who can <hi>utter</hi> his mighty Acts, or ſhew forth all his Praiſe! —Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the Apoſtle <hi>labours</hi> in my <hi>Context,</hi> to ſpeak of the <hi>Gift</hi> of God; ſeems at a <hi>loſs,</hi> ſpeaks abundantly, over and over, and knows not when he has ſaid enough of the excellent Grace: <q>
                  <hi>Inriched,</hi> ſays he, <hi>in every thing,</hi> to all <hi>Bountifulneſs,</hi> which is <hi>abundant</hi> by many Thankſgivings to God, from thoſe that <hi>long</hi> after you for the <hi>exceeding</hi> Grace of God in you.</q>— If a Man wou'd ſpeak of a thing <hi>unſpeakable,</hi> it muſt be juſt after <hi>this manner;</hi> it being literally true, that <hi>no Tongue</hi> of Man can fully ſpeak the Praiſes of Chriſtian <hi>Charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Unſpeakable</hi> is the <hi>Good done</hi> in the World by a right <hi>charitable</hi> Frame of Spirit. Unſpeakable are the <hi>Needs</hi> which Sin has brought upon us, not only on the <hi>poor and low</hi> of the World, but alſo on <hi>others,</hi> even on the richeſt and higheſt. We unſpeakably need one anothers <hi>Help</hi> and Service, and unſpeakable are the <hi>Benefits</hi> we receive from others in our Neceſſities. The <hi>poor</hi> ſerve the <hi>rich</hi> abundantly, more eſpecially in their <hi>Sickneſſes;</hi> and very often do it <hi>gratis,</hi> for nothing, out of pure Humanity, Reſpect and Compaſſion, and are never requited: Sometimes from <hi>Gratitude</hi> for Favours received, and as often (I would wiſh) from a Principle of <hi>Grace</hi> within them, it being all the Way they have to expreſs a <hi>pious Love</hi> to God &amp; their Neighbours.—Others to whom God has given Riches, and <hi>Largeneſs</hi> of Heart
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004352_0010_1004498640425090"/>to do Good with it, give <hi>Portions</hi> to the Poor by ſevens and eights, and by ſcores and hundreds; <hi>deviſing</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral things, and caſting their <hi>Bread</hi> upon the Waters. <q>The <hi>Bowels</hi> of the poor are refreſhed by them, they are Eyes to the <hi>blind</hi> and Feet to the <hi>lame,</hi> Parents to the <hi>Fatherleſs,</hi> and they cauſe the <hi>Widow</hi>'s Heart to ſing; the Bleſſing of them that are ready to <hi>periſh</hi> comes on them, and of him that is <hi>helpleſs.</hi>
               </q> They are as the Heat and Rain to a thirſty and cold Earth, as the <hi>Light</hi> of the Morning and the <hi>Dews</hi> of the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thoſe among whom they dwell, who paſs their <hi>Days and Nights</hi> the better for their Neighbourhood. <q>Their Glory is <hi>freſh</hi> in them, and their <hi>Bow</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in their Hand.</q> They live not to <hi>Themſelves,</hi> but others <hi>glean</hi> by handfuls of what they plentifully ſowe. God <hi>multiply</hi> their Seed ſown, and <hi>increaſe</hi> the Fruits of their Righteouſneſs; while the <hi>Loyns</hi> of the Poor bleſs them, warm'd with the <hi>Fleece</hi> of their Flock. Theſe are the Men of whom we ſhall <hi>hear well</hi> another Day, but how will they be able to <hi>bear the Joy</hi> of the bleſſed Words! <q>
                  <hi>I was hungry and ye gave me Meat, thirſty and ye gave me Drink, naked and ye clothed me, a Stranger and ye took me in</hi>
               </q>. Unſpeakable (you ſee) is the <hi>Good done</hi> in this needy World, and <hi>Heaven</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges it to be ſo, and accordingly <hi>rates the Gift</hi> in the Book of Account.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Unſpeakable is <hi>the Glory redounding to</hi> GOD from a right Chriſtian <hi>charitable</hi> Frame of Spirit, in the noble humble Exerciſe of it thro' the Earth, and therefore is it an <hi>unſpeakable Gift.</hi> This is a <hi>Reaſon</hi> or Argument that riſes much higher than the former; for if it be a good and great Thing to do much Good to our Fellow-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, how much more is it to be any Ways Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in any <hi>Glory and Honour</hi> to the Name of GOD? Yet HE <hi>is glorified</hi> (ſays my Context) by <hi>Others,</hi> on the Account of the Acts of <hi>Bounty</hi> done them by their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Neighbour.</p>
            <p>The Great and bountiful <hi>God</hi> makes <hi>much,</hi> makes the <hi>moſt</hi> of our <hi>little Alms</hi> and Offerings to Him: As our <hi>Saviour</hi> did of the <hi>Widow's two Mites;</hi> they were
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004352_0011_100449A97A9F3B90"/>a <hi>rich</hi> Offering in his Eye, and he <hi>magnify'd</hi> it and her. So God <hi>ſhines on his own Works</hi> wrought in us and by us, and puts great <hi>Honour</hi> on 'em, makes great <hi>Account</hi> of 'em. And ſo in the laſt Day he will glorify <hi>Himſelf</hi> in glorifying his <hi>Elect,</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>In as much as ye have done it to the leaſt of theſe my Brethren, ye have done it unto me.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>We are bid to <q>let our Lights <hi>ſhine before Men,</hi> that they <hi>ſeeing</hi> our good Works may <hi>glorify our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> which is in Heaven.</q> The <hi>liberal Man</hi> does ſo, but <hi>not</hi> to be ſeen of Men. There is that is <hi>manifeſt,</hi> and cannot be <hi>hid.</hi> Men do not light a <hi>Candle</hi> and put it under a <hi>Buſhel.</hi> A good Man bleſſes God for the Light that ſhines on <hi>others,</hi> as well as on Himſelf. If <hi>one</hi> is inriched to all Bountifulneſs, it cauſes in <hi>others</hi> Thankſgiving to God; yea is abundant by <hi>many</hi> Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings to Him, ſays my <hi>Context:</hi> "They <hi>glorify</hi> God for your profeſſed Subjection to the Goſpel, and <hi>pray</hi> unto God for you.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>leaſt Glory</hi> to God is an <hi>unſpeakable</hi> thing. What is <hi>Man,</hi> and what the <hi>World</hi> he lives in, and what the <hi>Riches</hi> thereof, and you will ſay what the <hi>poor</hi> of it, that GOD ſhould have <hi>Glory</hi> from them! "<hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold He putteth no Truſt in his Saints, and the Heavens are not clean in his Sight! how much leſs Man that is a Worm!</hi> What then can <hi>Man</hi> think or ſpeak of, ask or <hi>pray</hi> for, like to <hi>this! Father in Heaven, thy Name be hallowed!— for Thine is the Kingdom and Power and Glory for ever!</hi> Well is it made the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi> and the <hi>laſt,</hi> in our Prayers. It muſt be the <hi>everlaſting Law and Motive</hi> to us, reſpecting giving and receiving; 1 Peter iv. 11. <hi>If any Man miniſter, of the Ability which God giveth, that God in all things may be glorified through Jeſus Chriſt; to whom be Praiſe and Dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>Good to our ſelves</hi> is unſpeakable, in a <hi>liberal</hi> and bountiful Spirit, and therefore it is an <hi>unſpeakable Gift</hi> to us and in us. Unſpeakable is the <hi>preſent Comfort</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:004352_0012_100449895AA866E0"/>to a good Man by this <hi>Gift,</hi> and unſpeakable is the <hi>future and eternal Reward</hi> of it in the Life to come.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If we conſider only the <hi>Pleaſure</hi> and Comfort of it to a Man in <hi>this Life,</hi> to be of a merciful and <hi>bountiful Eye,</hi> it is to him an unſpeakable Gift. He is <hi>ſatisfied in Himſelf,</hi> God anſwers him in <hi>the Joy of his Heart.</hi> The greateſt Pleaſure of Life is to <hi>be</hi> good and <hi>do</hi> good. The Words of our <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> are to be had in everlaſting Remembrance, "<hi>It is more bleſſed to give than to receive.</hi> The Man's <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Frame</hi> is more bleſſed; unleſs it be when the <hi>poor</hi> Man exceeds in <hi>Grace,</hi> in the <hi>manner</hi> of his receiving; and then the <hi>Tide</hi> turns on his Side.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Job</hi> tells us the <hi>Pleaſure</hi> he found in Acts of <hi>Munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence</hi> in the Days of his Proſperity; and it was unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: <q>When the <hi>Ear</hi> heard me, it <hi>bleſſed</hi> me! when the <hi>Eye</hi> ſaw me it gave <hi>witneſs</hi> to me! then ſaid I, I ſhall <hi>die in my Neſt,</hi> or <hi>multiply my Days</hi> as the Sand! my <hi>Root</hi> was <hi>ſpread out</hi> by the Waters, and the <hi>Dew</hi> lay all Night upon my <hi>Branch!</hi> my <hi>Glory</hi> was freſh in me, and my <hi>Bow</hi> was renewed in my Hand! they waited for me as for the <hi>Rain,</hi> and opened their Mouth <hi>wide</hi> as for the latter Rain! I choſe out their Way and ſat <hi>Chief,</hi> and dwelt as a <hi>King</hi> in his Army; as <hi>One</hi> that comforteth the Mourners.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Even all the <hi>bitter Sorrows of Job</hi> could not take away the Comfort of the Remembrance of his <hi>paſt Joys</hi> in Acts of <hi>Charity</hi> &amp; Mercy. "<hi>If</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I had with-held the poor from his Deſire,"</hi>— O the <hi>Pleaſure</hi> of yeilding them <hi>their Deſire,</hi> when it is <hi>pious</hi> and juſt, and the <hi>Power</hi> be in our Hand, and our <hi>Heart</hi> be big enough;—or <q>if I <hi>cauſed the Eyes of the Widow to fail!</hi> If <hi>I eat my Morſel alone,</hi> and the <hi>Fatherleſs</hi> did not ſhare with me! for from my <hi>Youth</hi> I was his <hi>Father,</hi> and Widow's <hi>Guide.</hi>
               </q> —I tell you, that as the <hi>Heart</hi> knows its own <hi>Bitterneſs,</hi> ſo only the Heart of a <hi>Job</hi> knows the <hi>Comfort</hi> of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of ſuch a <hi>Frame</hi> and Exerciſe, as this which his own Words have ſpoken, and who can add to them? How did all the <hi>Good</hi> he had ever done to the Poor <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> into his own <hi>Boſom,</hi> and <hi>flow out</hi> of his <hi>Lips</hi> from

He <hi>felt</hi> the ruling Power of Grace, and had <hi>Confidence</hi> toward God. The <hi>Joy of Faith and Hope</hi> accompanied and follow'd the Exerciſe of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>brotherly Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. But the Great and laſt, the <hi>infinite and eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> of Grace, to the <hi>charitable</hi> and godly Man, are in the Bleſſedneſs and Glories of <hi>the World to come,</hi> and theſe render the <hi>Gift</hi> of Grace to him and in him <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable.</hi>

                  <hi>Eye</hi> has not ſeen this, nor <hi>Ear</hi> heard it, nor can it enter into our <hi>Hearts</hi> to conceive of it.

III. The <hi>higheſt Thankſgivings</hi> are due from us to the <hi>bleſſed God,</hi> for this <hi>his unſpeakable Gift</hi> to any of the Children of Men; and ſhould be <hi>fervently render'd</hi> to Him in the <hi>Churches</hi> of his Saints. "<hi>Thanks be to God for his unſpeakable Gift.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But (as was ſaid before) <hi>what</hi> Thanks can <hi>we</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, when the Gift is <hi>unſpeakable?</hi> O 'tis <hi>above</hi> all our Praiſes and Bleſſings! Yet as the <hi>Levites</hi> ſaid to the Auguſt Congregation, Nehem ix. 5. "<hi>Stand up and bleſs the Lord your God for ever and ever! and bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed be thy glorious Name which is exalted above all Praiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall only ſay <hi>two</hi> Things here,</p>
            <p n="1">1. They that <hi>receive</hi> the Gift ſhould be very <hi>thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> to God for it. The charitable Perſon ſhould him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf give <hi>Thanks</hi> to God for making him ſo, while yet he <hi>abaſes</hi> himſelf before the Lord, as an unprofitable Creature, and behaves humble and lowly before <hi>Men.</hi> Yet ought he to glorify God for any <hi>Heart</hi> to do good, and for any <hi>Means</hi> to do it. He muſt aſſume nothing to <hi>himſelf,</hi> but aſcribe all to <hi>God;</hi> of Whom and <hi>to Whom</hi> are all things. "For what haſt <hi>thou</hi> which is not receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? and if received, whereof haſt thou to <hi>glory?</hi> The Glory belongs to Him who has given to <hi>thee,</hi> that <hi>thou</hi> may'ſt give to others. As, ſuppoſe a rich and charitable Perſon puts into my Hand a <hi>Sum</hi> or Sums of Money to diſtribute unto others in Want; it is <hi>his</hi> Gift and Bounty, and not mine; and <hi>I</hi> ought to be thankful to Him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with thoſe to whom I diſtribute. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner if GOD give <hi>You</hi> Ability and a Heart to do good to others, you owe the <hi>firſt</hi> Thanks to God, and ſhou'd be ready to ſay with the <hi>Church, "Not unto us, O Lord, not to us, but to thy Name be Glory.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>You,</hi> my <hi>Brethren!</hi> that are honoured of God to <hi>give</hi> unto the poor, might have been your ſelves, and ſo your Families, among the <hi>indigent</hi> and neceſſitous!

Or yet <hi>worſe,</hi> You might have been among the nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardly and <hi>covetous</hi> in the midſt of Riches; not able to <hi>eat</hi> of your own Bread, and leſs to give unto others! An <hi>Evil</hi> too often ſeen and felt, a Miſery too common under the <hi>Sun,</hi> which yet ſhines liberally on the niggard Soul.</p>
            <p>Or ſtill worſe, You might have been among the <hi>frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent and unjuſt,</hi> the Cheat, the Theif and the Robber; or (which is little better) the Gripe and the Extortioner, the Spoiler of the Widow, the motherleſs and fatherleſs! But who has made you to <hi>differ?</hi> made Thee a <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor</hi> and Bleſſing to the World, among theſe Plagues and Curſes in it? GOD, who is rich in Mercy, and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign</hi> in his Gifts and Grace to Men, <hi>He</hi> has done it! "Who has Mercy becauſe he <hi>will</hi> have Mercy. He that made <hi>Abel Cain</hi>'s Brother, and gave to <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> their <hi>Grandeur</hi> of Heart.</p>
            <p>Let <hi>free Grace</hi> therefore have all the Glory; as the Apoſtle teaches us, Epheſ. 3.18. <hi>To me, who am leſs than the leaſt of all Saints is this Grace given.</hi> So <hi>thou</hi> 
               <q>by the <hi>Grace</hi> of God art what thou art, and his Grace given thee has not been <hi>in vain!</hi> And if you <hi>labour</hi> more than others, yet not <hi>you,</hi> but the Grace of God in You.</q>—So when <hi>David</hi> had done a <hi>kingly</hi> part, and his <hi>Princes</hi> a very <hi>princely</hi> one, in way of Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings out of their Eſtates; then <hi>David</hi> ſaid before the Lord, 1 Chron. xxix. 14. <q>

            </p>
            <p>The Gifts and Graces of <hi>others,</hi> and the <hi>Uſe</hi> God pleaſes to make of them, ſhould be <hi>pleaſant</hi> to us and <hi>admired</hi> by us; and we ſhould rejoice in all that we ſee of God in them.

            <p>God knows the irreligious <hi>poor,</hi> ungrateful to Him, <hi>unthankful and unholy,</hi> who receive and eat and give him not Thanks. It may be they <hi>how</hi> to Men, and <hi>treble</hi> their Thanks to them and <hi>bleſs</hi> 'em, and yet do <hi>not</hi> lift their Hearts at all to God.
