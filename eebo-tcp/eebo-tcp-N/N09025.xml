            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>On the eighth day of September. A. D. 1767 a conſiderable number of baptiſt miniſters and brethren met at Warren in Rhode-Island Government to conſult about the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediency of an aſſociation, and the manner of conducting it to the advantage of the churches. The iſſue of the meeting was, Adopting the ſentiments and plat-form of the weſtern aſſociation; and thereon forming themſelves into a like body to be known by the name of the <hi>Warren Aſſociation.</hi> The churches that incorporated that year were the church of Warren, of Haverhil, of Bellingham and Middleborough. The next year four more joined them viz the church of Boſton, of Sutton, of Leiceſter and of Ware. This year 1769 four more were added viz the church of Sturbridge, of Enfield, of Wilbreham and of Montague.</p>

            <head>Sentiments touching an Aſſociation</head>
            <p n="1">1 That ſuch a combination of churches is not only prudent but uſeful, as has appeared even in America by the experience of upwards of 60 years. Some of the uſes of it are—Union and communion among themſelves—maintaining more effectually the order and faith once deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the ſaints—Having advice in caſes of doubts, and help in diſtreſs. Being more able to promote the good of the cauſe—and becoming impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in the eye of the civil powers, as has already appeared in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances on this continent 2. That ſuch an aſſociation is conſiſtent with the independency and power of particular churches, becauſe it pretends to be no other than an <hi>Adviſory council,</hi> utterly diſclaiming ſuperiority, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, coercive right, and infallibility 3. That an aſſociation ſhould conſiſt of men knowing and judicious, particulary in the Scripture. The reaſons are obvious; ſuch men are the fitteſt to repreſent communities who profeſs the Scriptures to be the only rule of faith and practice in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious matters, and who expect that every advice, opinion, or direction they receive from an aſſociation be ſcriptural. They ſhould be ſkilful and expert in the laws of their God as counſellors are in the laws of the land, for that is the ground of the churches application to them.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="plan">
            <head>Plan of the Aſſociation</head>
            <p n="1">1. The aſſociation to conſiſt only of meſſengers choſen and ſent by the churches. Theſe meſſengers to be their miniſters (for a reaſon given in ſentiment the 3,) together with ſome judicious brethren. Their expences to be borne by the churches which ſend them.</p>
            <p n="2">2, With the meſſengers the churches ſend letters addreſſed to the aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation. In theſe letters mention is made of the names of the meſſengers, and their authority to act for their churches; alſo of the ſtate of the churches touching their peace-their increaſe by baptiſm; and by letters diſmiſſive &amp; commendatory from other churches—touching their diminution by death, excommunication, and diſmiſſion to other churches, and the preſent number of members. If any queſtions are to be put to the aſſociation—any advice to aſk—or buſineſs to propoſe, theſe are to be expreſſed in ſaid letters.</p>
            <p n="3">3. All matters to be determined in this aſſociation by the ſuffrage of the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011519_0004_0F86F5C5C674B1D8"/>
meſſengers, except what are determinable by Scripture— ſuch matters are never put to the deciſion of votes. All that ſpeak are to addreſs the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator, who is to take care that none be interrupted while ſpeaking, and that no other indecorum take place.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Churches are to be received into this aſſociation by petitions, ſetting forth their deſire to be admitted—their faith—order— and willingneſs to be conformable to the rules of the aſſociated body. When a petition is read, and the matter ripened for a vote; the moderator ſtates the queſtion, ſuffrage being given in favour of the petition, the ſaid moderator declares that ſuch a church is received into the aſſociation, in token of which he gives the meſſengers the <hi>right hand of fellowſhip,</hi> and bids them take their ſeats.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The aſſociation to meet annually at Warren on Tueſday next after the firſt Wednesday in September at two a clock in the afternoon; and to continue till buſineſs be finiſhed. It is to be opened with divine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice—after which a moderator and clerk are choſen—the letters from the churches are read—the names of the meſſengers are written, that they may be called over at after meetings—then buſineſs is attended to, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes thereof made—A circular letter to the churches is prepared and ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and a copy of it ſent to every church, containing the minutes of the aſſociation; the ſtates of the churches; when and by whom vacancies are to be ſupplied; who to preach the next aſſociation ſermon, and whatever elſe is needful for the churches to know.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A connexion to be formed and maintained between this aſſociation and that of Philadelphia by annual letter and meſſengers from us to them and from them to us.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The faith and order of this aſſociation are expreſſed in a confeſſion put forth by upwards of a hundred congregations (in Great Britain) in the year 1689; and adopted by the aſſociation of Philadelphia in 1742. Some of the principles in ſaid confeſſion are—The imputation of Adam's ſin to his poſterity — The inability of man to recover himſelf—Effectual calling by ſovereign grace—Juſtification by imputed righteouſneſs—Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion for baptiſm, and that on profeſſion of faith and repentance—Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gregational churches, and their independency—Reception into them upon evidence of ſound converſion &amp;c.</p>
