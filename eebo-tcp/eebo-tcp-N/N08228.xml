            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE enſuing Diſcourſe makes its Appearance in Compliance with your repeated Solicitations; and not from any Fondneſs in me to commence Author. Neither had I the moſt diſtant Expectation when preparing for the Pulpit, that it would ever be called for after You had heard it. I therefore thought it neceſſary, in tranſcribing for the Preſs, to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Enlargements; for which I perſuade myſelf I need make no Apology.</p>
            <p>The Extaſy which this good News occaſioned, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all Ranks of People, as ſoon as certainly known; compared with that awful Indifference, with which the glad Tidings of Salvation are heard by our Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants in general; at once ſuggeſted to me the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency of attempting to improve it in this ſpiritual Manner.</p>
            <p>I would therefore with all Humility, lay this ſmall Performance at the Feet of Jeſus, who is exalted as Head over all Things to the Church; and who can, out of the Mouths of Babes and Sucklings perfect Praiſe. And remain,</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>HOULD I ſerve you a century in the goſpel of Chriſt, I might never again have ſo favourable an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to conſider this paſſage. It is a proverb, the truth of which you are now feeling: Hence great is the propriety of improving its ſpiritual mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And the preacher will have the advantage, while he attempts to illuſtrate the glories of the goſpel, by what the people feel. Has not a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral joy diffuſed itſelf amongſt us? Does not Boſton and the country wear a face of pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:010503_0005_0F8018567208F9A8"/>
You may read good news in every counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. How great the alteration, that has taken place amongſt us, in conſequence of a late moſt intereſting deciſion in our favour! <note n="*" place="bottom">Alluding to the Repeal of the Stamp-Act.</note> When the news arrived, ſo as to be confidently believed, there was a univerſal ſhout.—It now became im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for every lover of liberty and his country, to conceal the gladneſs of his heart: Public and private were the expreſſions of joy on this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant occaſion! Yea your children, yet igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the importance of this event to theſe colonies, bear a part in the triumphs of the day; in imitation, no doubt, of their parents and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whom they obſerve pleaſed on this happy occurrence. Well thought I, will good news from an earthly Prince, that brings deliverance, and gives us the proſpect of the continuance of our moſt dear and invaluable rights and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, which we apprehended on the brink of departing from us; fill us with ſuch a general gladneſs, that ſcarce a tongue will be ſilent?— Oh how much more might we expect that the glad tidings of ſalvation; ſalvation from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting miſery, to the fruition of endleſs happineſs, would diffuſe a univerſal joy!—How juſtly might we look for the tongue of the dumb to ſing — for the ſtammerer to ſpeak plainly; and for the mouths of babes and ſucklings, to help on the exalted tribute of praiſe to Him, who hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to men the miniſtry of reconciliation; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring <hi>peace on earth, good will towards men?</hi> But alas, ſuch is the carnality of the heart of man, that though ſoon elated with temporal deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010503_0006_0F8018572C1504D8"/>
he is blind to, and too little affected with the <hi>great ſalvation!</hi> What means this ſtrange conduct? The one is believed with a warm heart; the other ſeems to the poor ſinner as an idle tale, and he believes it not! Surely "the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not, leſt the light of the glorious goſpel of Chriſt, who is the image of God, ſhould ſhine unto them." <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cor. 4.4.</note>
            </p>
            <p>AGAIN. Do I obſerve both the righteous, and the wicked rejoicing on this occaſion? Yes: And let me add, good reaſon they have to do ſo. But on the other, though infinitely more important, even the righteous themſelves are ſhamefully neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, and lukewarm.—Do I ſee the children in the ſtreets exulting in this good news from a far country? Oh thought I that this news of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption thro' our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, might be ſo gladly, and generally received; and become ſo powerful in its influence on parents and heads of families, that their lives and converſations, might ſweetly conſtrain their little ones to join that triumphant <hi>"Hoſanna to the Son of David,"</hi> Mat. 21.15.—But why ſhould we wonder if the children withhold the tribute of praiſe, when the parents themſelves are ſinfully ſilent?</p>
            <p>ARE we tenacious of our rights and liberties? And do we fear every thing that looks like an infringment? What think we then of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct towards Him, who is the only Potentate? How often have we been for wreſting the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010503_0007_0F80185993D1AB60"/>
from Him, and have practically ſaid, <hi>"We will not have the Lord to reign over us?"</hi> Is not Jehovah tender of his honour? His glory he will never give to another. He may ſay to us, "Ye have robbed me." <note n="*" place="bottom">Mal. 3.8.</note> Numerous have been our provocations againſt Him; and if he had entred into judgment with us, we ſhould have been cut off in our iniquity, and forever confined with the ſpirits in priſon. But lo, here is good news from a far country, a "God in Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling the world to himſelf!"—A method of ſalvation, exhibited in the goſpel, that effectually ſecures the honours of the divine government, and the harmony of Jehovah's attributes; while the chief of ſinners are made heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Jeſus Chriſt! "As cold waters to a thirſty ſoul: ſo is this good news from a far country." <q>The proverbial ſenſe (ſays Dr. Jermin) is, That what is gotten by hard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and after much time ſpent upon it, being as it were fetched from a far country, is moſt delightful being obtained. But to make uſe of the verſe in a more ſpiritual application: The fartheſt country that lies any where is heaven: And the good news are the tidings of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</q> In this ſpiritual manner, I ſhall, thro' di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine aſſiſtance, improve the text. And,

                     <pb n="9" facs="unknown:010503_0008_0F80185A935BA870"/>III. THAT it is "news" indeed; and empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically "good news."</item>
                  <item>IV. THAT this good news from heaven, is more welcome to a heavy laden ſinner, and a true believer thirſting after God, than cold waters are to any one athirſt.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>FIRST, We have news from heaven, a far coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. It is not uncommon in the ſacred writings, to ſpeak of heaven as a country: "But now they deſire a better country, that is, an heavenly." <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. 11.16.</note> In which chapter, the ſame word is repeated, to ſignify, that the believing Hebrews were in the purſuit of the kingdom of heaven.</p>
            <p>NOW the news we have from thence, the apoſtle Paul epitomizes, in writing to his Son Timothy, of the exceeding riches of the grace of God in his converſion, and call to the apoſtleſhip: "This is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Chriſt Jeſus came into the world to ſave ſinners; of whom I am chief." <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Tim. 1.15.</note> I aſk you, as Chriſt did the Jews of John's baptiſm, Is this news from heaven, or of men?—You will readily anſwer, methinks, from heaven. From heaven it is, my Brethren.</p>
            <p n="1">I. AS it was there this glorious ſcheme of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption was concluded on, the ſubjects of it cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, and all the certain means of its execution deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. There it originated, and from thence it came. The covenant of grace bears an antient
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010503_0009_0F80185B9454D580"/>
date, even from eternity: Tho' the diſpenſation of it is late, ſince man's apoſtacy. Hence when Paul preached to the Epheſians, the unſearchable riches of Chriſt, he lets them know, that his call to the miniſtry, and the goſpel he delivered, were "according to God's eternal purpoſe, which he purpoſed in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord." <note n="*" place="bottom">Epheſ. 3.11.</note> And in this ſame epiſtle, he ſpeaks of our having been "choſen in Chriſt, before the foundation of the world." <note n="†" place="bottom">Epheſ. 1.4.</note> Various are the paſſages of holy ſcripture, that lead us to contemplate this <hi>counſel of peace,</hi> in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; before the world began. Then this ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting covenant, was well ordered in all things and ſure. Jeſus Chriſt was choſen by the Father, as the head of it; the heirs of promiſe were choſen in Him, and given to him as members of it; the means of their preſervation, effectual calling, and perfect ſanctification, were appointed. In ſhort, no part of it was left precarious; it being an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute covenant. <q>If the covenant of grace (ſays one) were not abſolute, ſalvation would be as difficult by it, as by the covenant of works; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is as hard for a natural man to believe and live, as it is for him to do and live.</q> This great truth, which appears to me to ſhine with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed brightneſs, in the holy Bible, is full of ſolid comfort to the pious ſoul; an article of high importance in the church of Chriſt; and when rightly underſtood, has a moſt powerful influence on the believer's practice. So far as I have had time, and opportunity to obſerve, I am led to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That a deviation from this and the other glorious doctrines, that are connected with it, has
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010503_0010_0F80185BB3510DF0"/>
generally been attended with a decay of vital religion. Its having been oppoſed is not ſtrange: For you may be confident, that nothing ſhort of divine influence, can bring a ſinner to fall in with, and really to ſubmit to the ſovereignty of God. A maxim that men have adopted, and which they warmly plead for with regard to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; they will not acknowledge when applied to the God of the ſpirits of all fleſh, viz. "That every one may do what he will with his own." But notwithſtanding the different ſentiments of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind as to this point; you will bear with me, while I ſay, That I believe it to be a doctrine from heaven.</p>
            <p n="2">II. IT is from heaven, as the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is the author of this ſalvation, is from thence. "I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world." <note n="*" place="bottom">Joh. 16.28.</note> Which I ſuppoſe is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of Chriſt, his aſſuming human nature: Or his appearing in that body, that had been prepared for him. "A body haſt thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared me" <note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. 10.5.</note> And this aſſumption of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was in the fulneſs of time. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Gal. 4.4.</note> i. e. the time appointed in eternity. This coming forth from the Father, can only hold true of Chriſt as medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator; as alſo where it is ſaid, "That God ſent him." As God, he fills all places at the ſame time; and therefore can neither be ſaid to go nor come. Neither as God can he be ſent; for then God muſt ſend God. i. e. He muſt ſend himſelf. This is unintelligible. But as mediator, he is ſent: In this character he came forth from the Father,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010503_0011_0F80185C76312B40"/>
and came into the world, when he became openly incarnate.</p>
            <p>BUT perhaps an objection will be ſtarted—"If the Son of God can only be ſaid to be ſent, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in human nature; how is it that the ſame phraſe is uſed of the Holy Ghoſt; who, as you ſay, is God equal with the Father and the Son; and never appeared in an aſſumed nature, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains a pure, infinite ſpirit?" For an anſwer to this objection, I freely give credit to the learned and pious Mr. Huſſey. <q>The Spirit's miſſion (ſays he) is not as the ſpirit is God, it is not abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly God the ſpirit; for the Holy Ghoſt could not be ſent or come from the Father thus, becauſe as an infinite perſon, he doth together with the Father and the Son, fill all places at once, and ſo as the Spirit is God, muſt not be ſaid to go from one place to another, but it is as Comforter that he doth ſo. He doth not fill all the world as Comforter, but it is as God the Spirit that he fills all the world.</q> I obſerve, my hearers, when Chriſt promiſed the Spirit, and ſaid he would ſend him, it was under the character of Comforter. "I will ſend you another Comforter."—"If I go not away, the Comforter will not come." Thus mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a diſtinction between his office, and his eſſence. As the ſame author ſays, <q>He is not given in his eſſence, but in his office, as the immediate cauſe of our obtaining the graces of the ſpirit.</q> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we know that <q>he abideth in us, by the ſpirit which he hath given us, 1 John 3.24. Here is his perſon in the office of a Comforter.</q> Again. <q>Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010503_0012_0F80185D47809BC8"/>
in us, becauſe he hath given us of his Spirit, 1 John 14.3. There are the graces of the ſpirit, and both put together do make up the full diſtinction in the two branches of it as laid down above.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Huſſey's Glory of Chriſt unveil'd.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THUS the objection is anſwered, while we diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the office of the Holy Ghoſt, from his eſſence as God. He was ſent as a Paraclete or Comforter, but not as God the Spirit.</p>
            <p>I MIGHT go on to obſerve, that Jeſus Chriſt made it evident, that he was from heaven, by the kingdom he ſet up in the world. His appearance among men; making himſelf of no reputation, and taking upon him the form of a ſervant: The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany he kept of choice, who were not the rich, and noble, but poor and deſpiſed; oblige us to think "his kingdom is not of this world." If he had had in view, a worldly kingdom, depend upon it, he would have proceeded according to worldly maxims. But ſo far from this, that he treated the riches, the honours, and glories of this world, with manifeſt indifference. The meanneſs of his birth and parentage, at once rendred him the object of contempt: The men he choſe to be his diſciples and followers, were ſo contemptible in the eyes of the Jews; that he could expect nothing but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity in conſequence thereof. Yet this gave him no concern; becauſe he came into the world to eſtabliſh a ſpiritual kingdom. And he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to hope for; neither had he any thing to fear, from the men of this world, but what he foreſaw, and was able to prevent; provided it would not iſſue in the advancement of this his kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:010503_0013_0F80185DED264DC8"/>HOWEVER the Jews found fault with Chriſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed him and ſet him at naught on this account; you chriſtians ſee a coincidence between every part of his <hi>conduct,</hi> and his <hi>deſign</hi> to eſtabliſh a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual kingdom. From the beginning of his life, to the end of it, he conſtantly convinced us, that he came not to ſeek the favour and honours of men. And as to his diſciples, they willingly left all to follow him; riſqued their lives in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of his divine religion; and gave repeated, indiſputable evidences that "by patient continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in well-doing, they ſought for glory, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality; eternal life." "They reckoned that the ſufferings of this preſent time, were not worthy to be compared with the glory that ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in them." <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. 8.18.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. WHILE we conſider the doctrines them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; their ſpecial influence on the heart and life; and the glorious proſpect they give us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the grave; we are confident they are from heaven.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE doctrines themſelves: Such as a Trinity of perſons, in the unity of the divine eſſence—The incarnation of Jeſus Chriſt—Juſtification by faith: Or righteouſneſs imputed without works. <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. 4.6.</note> The deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt, and his powerful energy in changing the ſinner's heart, and carrying on the work of ſanctification in believers: The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling of this Holy Spirit, together with his bearing witneſs with the believer's ſpirit, that he is a child of God; and thus ſweetly ſealing him unto
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010503_0014_0F80185EB0B0B8C0"/>
the day of redemption. Theſe, and many other great and precious truths, which it never en<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>d into the heart of man to conceive, till they were ſet before us in the goſpel, demand our faith. Their importance, &amp; ſublimity, will at once ſtrike the devout mind; and he readily acknowledge they bear a divine ſignature. I think I may ſafely ſay, They never would have been thought of by men, if they had not been revealed in the goſpel; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſolutely impoſſible, that man ſhould invent, what he could not afterward fully comprehend: Which is particularly true of the doctrine of the Trinity, and the incarnation of the Son of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THIS goſpel has a ſpecial influence on the heart, and life. It begins with the heart; laying the ax to the root of the tree. "It comes with power, the Holy Ghoſt, and much aſſurance." <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Theſſ. 1.5.</note> Hence the man becomes a new creature, old things paſs away, and all things become new. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural enmity is ſlain, and the image of Chriſt form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſoul. This great change is called rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration: And in whomſoever it is wrought, there are new apprehenſions of divine things—new feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings—"Joy and peace in believing."—There will alſo be a different conduct. "The grace of God that bringeth ſalvation, hath appeared unto all men; teaching us that denying ungodlineſs, and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world." <note n="†" place="bottom">Tit. 2.11, 12.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THERE is no part of a chriſtian's conduct, while he acts in that character, but what is under the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010503_0015_0F80185F6CA57568"/>
influence of this goſpel. It influentially inclines him to the whole of his duty; to pay an unreſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved obedience to every divine precept: In a word, <hi>To do juſtly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ITS ſpecial influence alſo on the believer's mind, at once diſcovers that it is of divine origin. How does it raiſe his affections from this world, and fix them on things above? He will have his converſation in heaven, and dwell on high. For this goſpel immediately tends to make him ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually minded. That high reliſh, with which he formerly graſped after the things of time, ſubſides, in conſequence of his feeling the power of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt. Such an one ſees that God is his portion; that Jeſus Chriſt is the Alpha and Omega of his happineſs; that heaven is his home! Here then will his captivated ſoul reſt infinitely ſatisfied; and the world appear as a very little thing. For at the ſame time that the goſpel leads the believer to ſoar above created good; it alſo, in the hands of the divine Spirit, promotes his "meetneſs for the enjoyment of the inheritance of the ſaints in light." And this it does, as it ſets before him the infinite evil of ſin; making it appear "exceeding ſinful:" The intrinſic beauty of holineſs; which as it is eſſential to God, ſo, to every devout ſoul, it is a pleaſing part of the divine character. The former he abhors, and groans under; the latter he longs for, and follows after. Yea ſo fervent, and inceſſant are the deſires of the heaven-born-ſoul, that he cannot be contented while there are the ſmalleſt remains of ſin in him: Nothing will ſatisfy him ſhort of perfect holineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:010503_0016_0F8018605B226558"/>WELL my Brethren, as this is the tendency of our goſpel, ſure we are that it came down from heaven.</p>
            <p n="3">3. WE will add to the above conſiderations, the glorious proſpect the goſpel gives us beyond the grave. Without this "good news" from heaven, death would indeed be a <hi>leap in the dark.</hi> "We ſhould, as alas the heathen do, grope for the wall like the blind, and grope as if we had no eyes; we ſhould ſtumble at noon-day as in the night; and be in deſolate places as dead men." <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa. 59.10.</note> Conſider the preſent ſtate of the heathen world; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without the goſpel, is in groſs darkneſs: While to us "the light is come, and the glory of the Lord is riſen upon us." Jeſus, who came forth from the Father, "hath aboliſhed death, and bro't life and immortality to light thro' the goſpel." <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Tim. 1.10.</note> He hath, ſays this apoſtle, "aboliſhed death." i. e. removed its ſting, and diveſted the grave of all its horrors, with reſpect to believers, by dying &amp; riſing again; and by making known to them, a ſtate of immortal life and glory in the world to come. Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation informs us that in "God's preſence there is fulneſs of joy, and at his right hand pleaſures for evermore." <note n="‡" place="bottom">Pſal. 16.11.</note> It gives us a comfortable aſſurance, that the ſouls of the righteous upon the diſſolution of the body, do inſtantly paſs to heaven. "Then ſhall the duſt return to the earth as it was: And the ſpirit ſhall return unto God who gave it." <note n="§" place="bottom">Eccleſ. 12.7.</note> In which words take notice, that the ſpirit's return to God, is connected with the return of the lifeleſs body to the earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:010503_0017_0F801861570D3AD8"/>THE view then that the righteous have of death, is no more than a change of place; a tranſition from a vale of tears, to the regions of endleſs bliſs; where "the wicked ceaſe from troubling: and where the weary be at reſt" Bleſs God, O my ſoul, for this good news, that gives believers ſuch a tranſporting proſpect beyond the narrow limits of time! Where they "ſhall be with Chriſt, to behold his glory!" <note n="*" place="bottom">John 17.24.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. I MIGHT add, That the manner in which this news has been conveyed to us, further ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us that it is from heaven, viz. By God Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf—by immediate inſpiration—and by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of angels. But here I ſhall not enlarge, leſt I anticipate what more properly belongs to the next general head. I therefore paſs to conſider,</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, By what methods the Lord hath been pleaſed to make known to us his glorious goſpel.</p>
            <p n="1">1. IT all lay hid in the divine mind till the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy. Man's fall introduced the neceſſity of the recovery, and opened a door for the revelation of it. Which was firſt made to Adam, by God Himſelf, Gen. 3.15. "And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy ſeed and her ſeed: It ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel." Theſe words are to be viewed in a twofold light, as a threatning to the ſerpent, and as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to Adam. This may appear by a ſhort com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the verſe. The "ſeed of the woman" no doubt deſigns Jeſus Chriſt, who is ſaid in the New
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:010503_0018_0F801861ACADE1A8"/>
Teſtament to be "made of a woman." <note n="*" place="bottom">Gal. 4.4.</note> As for the enmity ſpoken of, it has always been obvious, between the "ſeed of the woman," Chriſt, and all his ſpiritual ſeed believers; and the old ſerpent, the devil, and his ſeed the children of diſobedience. It appeared ſo early as the days of Cain, who ſlew his brother Abel, for no other reaſon, but becauſe "his own works were evil, and his brother's righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous." <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Joh. 3.13.</note> The ſame ſpirit of oppoſition now reigns in the breaſts of the unregenerate. It follows, "He ſhall bruiſe thy head." Chriſt the "ſeed of the woman" hath ſlain the old ſerpent, "and bruiſed ſatan under his feet." <note n="‡" place="bottom">Rom. 16.20.</note>— Note, Chriſt is to bruiſe the head of the ſerpent; which intends nothing leſs than his abſolute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt over him Accordingly Paul ſpeaks of his "deſtroying him that had the power of death, that is, the devil." <note n="‖" place="bottom">Heb. 2.14.</note>
            </p>
            <p>YOU alſo take notice, that the ſerpent is to "bruiſe his heel." To bruiſe the heel is not dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; life is not at ſtake. From hence we learn, that at moſt ſatan can only trouble, haraſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs the children of God: Whom he ſhall never be able to deſtroy. "Becauſe I live, ſaid Chriſt, ye ſhall live alſo." <note n="§" place="bottom">I have conſidered the heel as deſigning the members of Chriſt, who are often bruiſed by ſatan; of whom it is juſtly ſaid "That he goes about like a roaring lion, ſeeking whom he may devour." Though at the ſame time allowing, <q>That the heel may rather deſign the human nature of Chriſt, which is his inferior and loweſt nature, and who was in it frequently expoſed to the inſults, temptations and perſecutions of ſatan, and was at laſt brought to a painful and accurſed death; though by dying he got an entire victory over him, and all his Enemies, and obtained ſalvation for his people.</q>

            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:010503_0019_0F801863E34F8148"/>THIS was the firſt intimation of "good news from a far country." It was afterward repeated to Abraham, Gen. 22.18. "And in thy ſeed ſhall all the families of the earth be bleſſed." After that to Iſaac in the ſame expreſſions, Gen. 26.4.—Then to Jacob, Gen. 28.14. After which we find it made known to Judah, by Jacob; when in a ſpirit of prophecy he bleſſed his ſons, Gen. 49.10. "The ſceptre ſhall not depart from Judah, nor the law-giver from between his feet, until SHILOH come, and unto Him ſhall the gathering of the people be." So we might proceed thro' the whole old teſtament; ſhewing when, by whom, and how the Lord hath made known to us this "great ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion." But you, who read your Bibles, cannot, methinks be ignorant that all the prophets bore witneſs to the coming of the Meſſiah," who was to be cut off, but not for himſelf." David, Iſaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel, Zechariah, Malachi, and the other prophets ſpoke concerning Jeſus, as they at "ſundry times were moved by the Holy Ghoſt." <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. 1.1.</note> David foretold the manner of his death—"They pierced my hands and my feet."—Iſaiah is with propriety ſtiled the evangelic prophet." In what moving language does he, ſeven hundred years before our Saviour's birth, deſcribe his dolorous ſufferings? And the nearer the time approached
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:010503_0020_0F80186465D26B38"/>
for the ſun of righteouſneſs to irradiate our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nighted world, the clearer did the prophets expreſs themſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">II. THIS "good news" was made known to us, not only by clear prophecies, but a variety of ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant types and figures. Such as, The Scape-Goat—the Brazen Serpent—the Paſchal Lamb— ſlaying of Beaſts—many Waſhings, &amp;c. All theſe things had an important meaning to the Jewiſh worſhippers. Some of our modern Divines, have termed the Ceremonial law, the goſpel of the Old Teſtament. The Scape-Goat was doubtleſs typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal of Chriſt, and the transferring of Guilt from the elect to him. And that in ſo eminent a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that he that runs may read. "And Aaron ſhall lay his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confeſs over him all the iniquities of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael, and all their tranſgreſſions in all their ſins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and ſhall ſend him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderneſs. And the goat ſhall bear upon him all their iniquities, unto a land not inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed." <note n="*" place="bottom">Levit. 16.21, 22.</note> Here Guilt was typically transferred to the goat, which he bore away into a land not inhabited. This pointed to Chriſt; concerning whom Iſaiah ſaith—"The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all."<note n="†" place="bottom">Iſai. 53.6.</note> With which agree the words of Peter, "Who his own ſelf bare our ſins in his own body on the tree."<note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Pet. 2.24.</note>
            </p>
            <p>AS for the Brazen Serpent, Jeſus Chriſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modates it to Himſelf; "As Moſes lifted up the ſerpent in the wilderneſs, ſo muſt the Son of Man be lifted up. <note n="§" place="bottom">John 3.14.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:010503_0021_0F801864B02E0F88"/>THE uſe that was made of the blood of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and their various waſhings, all pointed to the "blood of ſprinkling;" that precious "blood that cleanſeth from all ſin." This part of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is copious, but I muſt not enlarge. Let theſe hints convince us, that Jeſus Chriſt was held forth to the Old Teſtament ſaints by theſe types and figures.</p>
            <p n="3">III. WHEN Chriſt had actually come in the fleſh, the miniſtry of angels was employed to make it known. "And the angel ſaid unto them, fear not: For behold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which ſhall be to all people. For unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Saviour, which is Chriſt the Lord.—And ſuddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly hoſt praiſing God, and ſaying, "Glory to God in the higheſt, and on earth peace, good will towards men." <note n="*" place="bottom">Luke 2.10—15.</note> See, the angels are in extaſy at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's birth; though not intereſted in it! "This good news from a far country, was more refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than cold waters to a thirſty ſoul." Good old Simeon was heard to ſay, "Lord now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace, according to thy word. For mine eyes have ſeen thy ſalvation: Which thou haſt prepared before the face of all people: A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Iſrael." Stop my ſoul and wonder!— Are angels all in raptures at this good news? Do they willingly deſcend to bring the tidings of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; when they want no Saviour? And what is the matter with them to whom it is brought;
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:010503_0022_0F80186572F52A80"/>
and are concerned in it for life or death eternal, that they are no more affected with it?—That they are not anxious to equal angels in their praiſes?— Oh that we had angels tongues, and the warm heart of Simeon, then ſhould we in heavenly ſtrains ſing "glory to God in the higheſt!"</p>
            <p n="4">IV. WHEN Chriſt grew up, he entred on the miniſtry in perſon; and according to Iſaiah's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, he went about "to preach good tidings to the meek, to bind up the broken hearted, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the priſon to them that were bound." <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſai. 61.1.</note> And he engaged many diſciples to tread in his ſteps; to whom he gave commiſſion to "go into all the world, and preach the goſpel to every creature." Who after his death, reſurrection, and aſcenſion; having received the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, went forth in his name, declaring with all boldneſs, That "He was the true Meſſiah, whom they with wicked hands had crucified, and ſlain." And great was the ſucceſs that immediately at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended their faithful miniſtrations. "And the word of God increaſed; and the number of the diſciples multiplied in Jeruſalem greatly; and a great company of the prieſts were obedient to the faith." <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts 6.7.</note>
            </p>
            <p>AND ſince the days of the apoſtles, the Lord hath taken care to ſupply his churches ſucceſſively, with a number of faithful men to preach his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious goſpel. "May the Lord of the harveſt, ſend forth more labourers into his harveſt!" "Faithful men that ſhall be able to teach others alſo!"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:010503_0023_0F8018662F548038"/>THUS we ſee how this good news has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to us. We joyfully conclude from theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, that it is from heaven. I paſs to the</p>
            <p>THIRD thing propoſed, which is to ſhew that this is news indeed; and emphatically "good news."</p>
            <p n="1">1. IT is news indeed, as it was never heard of, never thought of, by angels or men, till revealed. The apoſtle calls it, "the myſtery which hath been hid from ages, and from generations." <note n="*" place="bottom">Coloſſ. 1.26.</note> Who could have thought of a gracious promiſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and forgiveneſs, as ſoon as man had ſinned?—Had we not juſt reaſon to indulge a "fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation?"—Who could have imagined that God ſhould "ſo love this guilty world, as to give his only begotten ſon, that whoſoever believeth in him, might not periſh, but have everlaſting life?" Who could have believed it, if the report were not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, that "Jeſus Chriſt freely gave himſelf a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom for us?"—That he aſſumed human nature, in order "that he might have ſomewhat to offer?"— That he condeſcended "to be made like unto his brethren; that he might be a merciful and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful high-prieſt, in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the ſins of the people?"— That he obeyed the law in his life, and became obedient unto death, "even the death of the croſs?"—That he laid in the grave until the third day, when he ſealed his religion by riſing again?— And finally, that he aſcended up on high; and now, while I am preaching, and you are hearing,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:010503_0024_0F801866EC1D9FF8"/>
he appears our advocate with the Father. "Where he ever lives to make interceſſion.—Oh love di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine!—Wiſdom infinite! Who of you is not loſt in theſe wonders of redeeming love? It is as high as heaven, what can we do? May our hearts burn within us, while we contemplate this "news" from heaven; this revelation that God hath given of his Son!</p>
            <p n="2">II. This goſpel is new always. You that have known the truth, twenty, thirty, forty years; yet diſcover freſh wonders in Chriſt and his ſalvation. The half has never been told you, of the Glory, Beauty, Fulneſs, Love, Compaſſion, of this once crucified Jeſus. "He is altogether lovely, and the chiefeſt among ten thouſand." <note n="*" place="bottom">Cant. 5.10.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. THE ſaints will find ſomething new in this divine, and inexhauſtible ſubject, when they arrive at glory. Now they know in part; they ſee thro' a glaſs darkly; but then they ſhall know even as they are known; and ſee face to face. Then ſhall they underſtand infinitely more of the ſovereignty, the juſtice, the wiſdom of God in this oeconomy of redemption; and eternally ſing the "new ſong."</p>
            <p>IT is alſo emphatically "good news," if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider who is the author of it. It is good as to its contents, "peace on earth, and good will towards men." A Saviour born; ſalvation for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſinners. "A fountain opened to the houſe of David, and to the inhabitants of Jeruſalem for ſin, and for uncleanneſs:" Pardon of ſin: Peace of
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:010503_0025_0F80186940389078"/>
conſcience: Joy in the Holy Ghoſt—Support to believers in death; and everlaſting life in the future world.</p>
            <p>IT is good as it makes men good. Saul no ſooner feels the power of this goſpel, than he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts from perſecuting, and "preaches the faith which before he deſtroyed." Zaccheus is at once inclined, by a ſecret, but powerful influence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore four fold to every one, from whom he might have taken any thing by falſe accuſation. Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene will in a moment forſake her atrocious ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and follow Jeſus. The jaylor inſtantly waſhes the ſtripes he had made, but a few minutes before. In truth, when it comes with power, it makes great ſaints of great ſinners.</p>
            <p>ONCE more. It is good. i. e. it is pleaſant, as it brings eaſe to a guilty conſcience; conſolation to them that are caſt down. Which naturally leads us to the</p>
            <p>FOURTH general dead: That this good news from heaven, is more welcome to the heavy-laden ſinner, and the true believer thirſting after God, than cold waters are to any one athirſt.</p>
            <p>WHAT good news is, my Brethren, you know: You this moment feel. How long have we anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly waited the great event, that is now deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in our favour? How tedious was every day till the intereſting news arrived? What gloomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs appeared in every face? How was buſineſs ſtagnated? And how painful were the exerciſes of our ſuſpended minds? But the ſcene is altered;
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:010503_0026_0F80186A3A212638"/>
and gladneſs fills our breaſts; and would ſoon ſhew itſelf in every look, did not the ſolemnity of this day and place demand a ſerious countenance. It gives a ſpring to action—a pleaſure to the man in buſineſs; and we hope will ſpeedily revive e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very branch of trade. "As cold waters to a thirſty ſoul: So is this good news from a far country"— But infinitely more exhilerating is this good news from heaven;</p>
            <p n="1">I. TO the ſinner ſenſible of ſin, burdened with it, fearing the wrath of God, and everlaſting miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery; ready to give up all hope, lie down and die: For ſuch an one to be told of a way of recovery to the divine favour—in which God can be juſt, and juſtify him that believeth; how greatly will it encourage him? But for him to have a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving view of Chriſt, as the goſpel ſets him forth, in the perfection of his divine righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—his infinite atonement—the riches—free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſovereignty of his grace; as ſaving the chief of ſinners—juſtifying the ungodly; (which is one of the glories of the goſpel)—How will he perceive his load of guilt removed;—be brought to truſt his immortal all in the hands of this divine Redeemer; and have "joy and peace in believing?" <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. 15.13.</note> Suppoſe a criminal at the place of execution, ſtanding on the verge of eternity;; death ſtaring him in the face, to be preſented with a reprieve: How will it overjoy and melt him down? But how much more ſo, to be reprieved from eternal death, from everlaſting damnation; and to be made an heir of God, and a joint-heir
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:010503_0027_0F80186AB08B3348"/>
with Jeſus Chriſt? Infinitely more tranſporting is this good news to ſuch a ſoul!</p>
            <p n="2">II. IT is ſo to the real believer in all his after life. "He thirſts for God, for the living God." And the goſpel is the medium in which he ſees Him. In it "God is ſaid to be in Chriſt." <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cor. 5.19.</note> The believer could no more live as a chriſtian, without this goſpel; than he could at firſt believe without it. It is the joy and rejoicing of his heart. It is to his ſoul, what food is to the body. He feeds upon it; hence he grows in grace. "To know Chriſt and him crucified," is his invariable reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A crucified Jeſus, is to him a theme ever new, and ever welcome. And if at times, he gets at a diſtance from God, and ſinks into a ſtate of lukewarmneſs; which is alas too frequently the caſe, nothing but a looking to Jeſus as exhibited in this goſpel, can reſtore to him his wonted ſenſe of divine things. "I live, ſays Paul, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me." <note n="†" place="bottom">Gal. 2.20.</note>
            </p>
            <p>WHAT remains, is an improvement of the ſubject.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. WHAT reaſon have we to bleſs God for the goſpel? It is an invaluable bleſſing. "Bleſſed, ſays David, are they that hear the joyful ſound." You have heard of its influence on the heart and life; and have been reminded this day of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious proſpect it gives believers beyond the grave. Doubtleſs every devout mind will be raiſed; and every mouth filled with the language of gratitude, ſaying, "We thank thee, O Father, Lord of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:010503_0028_0F80186B73CF2B18"/>
and earth, becauſe thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them unto babes. Even ſo Father, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight." <note n="*" place="bottom">Matth. 11.25, 26.</note> Sure ſuch privileges as ours, call for thankfulneſs. And it might have a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to promote it, were we to conſider the happy ſtate of the chriſtian world, in contraſt with that of the heathen. To do this we need not go far. Behold, my Hearers, with compaſſion, the Savages on our own continent. They ſit in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and have no light. How barbarous, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human are many of their cuſtoms? They are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the "true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent." While we who are but a few miles from them, are ſurrounded with the means of grace. This is a favour we enjoy in a ſovereign manner. "Whence is it, that thou wilt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt thyſelf unto us, and not unto the world?"</p>
            <p>THE goſpel has a tendency, even when it does not change the heart, to inform the judgment; to ſoften the conſcience; and to lay ſinners under ſome reſtraints which they cannot eaſily get over. In this reſpect it influences the practice even of the unregenerate. We all know that thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, that were made on the mind in younger life, by a religious education, are not eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced. And if ſuch, when they grow up, would caſt off all regard to their education, and endulge every vicious deſire; they find they cannot do it at once; conſcience ſtands ready to reprove and to condemn. Viewing the goſpel then in this light, we have cauſe to bleſs God for it. But when
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:010503_0029_0F80186C49EDF630"/>
it becomes the power of God, unto ſalvation, to us, or ours; we ſhall have matter of endleſs praiſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. IF the goſpel is from heaven, and is ſo important in its nature, tendency and deſign;— if we as poor, ſinful, apoſtate creatures, are ſo immediately intereſted in it; how may we reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably expect it will be received and entertained? Surely with the higheſt gratitude, and the warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt love. But alas how contrary the treatment it meets with from Infidels and hardened ſinners! The Deiſt pours contempt upon it, and all its votaries. The ſecure ſinner turns his back upon it, ſaying, "What is your Beloved more than another Beloved?" And many of thoſe who have been favoured with the goſpel all their days, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in a ſtate of obduracy and impenitence; and that too where they have ſat under the moſt ſoul-ſearching miniſtry.</p>
            <p>FROM hence we ſee the depravity of human nature: And are perſuaded that the ſucceſs of the goſpel now, as well as in the firſt ages of the Church, depends abſolutely upon the powerful operations of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. HERE the heavy-laden ſinner beholds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. It is this goſpel only that can heal a wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conſcience. "The letter killeth, but the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit giveth life." <note n="*" place="bottom">Cor. 3.6.</note> All that the law can do, is to ſhew the ſinner his danger; that he is in loſt and periſhing circumſtances; but it neither points to, nor can it adminiſter any relief. It is the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt only, that exhibits a righteouſneſs
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:010503_0030_0F80186CF847AB48"/>
that anſwers to the perfection of the divine law. And ſinners in this condition ſee, that the holy, perfect law of God, will diſpenſe with nothing leſs than perfection. "Till heaven and earth paſs, one jot or one tittle ſhall in no wiſe paſs from the law, till all be fulfilled." <note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. 5.18.</note> Here then the goſpel is more welcome than cold waters to a thirſty ſoul, inaſmuch as it ſets Chriſt before us, as the "end of the law for righteouſneſs." <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. 10.4.</note> This is the balm of Gilead: And Jeſus is the divine phyſician, whoſe "blood ſpeaketh better things than the blood of Abel," <note n="‡" place="bottom">Heb. 12.24.</note> to every ſin-burdened ſoul.</p>
            <p>I SHALL now diſmiſs you, with an addreſs ſuited to the preſent joyful occaſion.</p>
            <p>MY Brethren, I have long wiſhed for, and now with pleaſure embrace the firſt opportunity, to congratulate you on a moſt important event: An event that ſpread gladneſs through Britain (a few excepted) and that cannot fail of warming every true American's heart. Should I ſpeak more plainly, your joy might become impetuous; and like the Nile overflow its banks. Look upon it as a royal confirmation of your civil and religious liberties;—theſe ſtand in immediate connection with each other: Inſomuch that the very act that leaves you in the enjoyment of the one, may be looked upon as confirming to you the other.</p>
            <p>THIS whole aſſembly—yea the whole Britiſh America is intereſted in this great deciſion. Great You will readily conclude, from what You have ſeen during the laſt ſeven months. I can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:010503_0031_0F80186DF28E0828"/>
our preſent ſtate to nothing with more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, than a ſerene ſky, and the ſmiling ſun, after a horrid tempeſt. Receive it as a favour from the beſt of earthly Monarchs; and always deeply im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs your minds, with the belief, that our moſt gracious Sovereign is the father of his people; and that we, his moſt faithful ſubjects in America, have no ſmall ſhare in his royal affections. Your deſire is granted—your burden removed;—and you left to enjoy your privileges.</p>
            <p>YOU are fluſhed with joy: It is a joyful oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. A propriety of conduct under this occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, I am confident you will all think neceſſary. And the more danger we are in of imprudence, as we are almoſt intoxicated with gladneſs. Bear with me, while I ſay, That firſt, and ſupremely you ſhould offer your unfeigned thankſgivings to the Lord, who reigns in the moral world, in that He hath inclined the King and Britiſh Parliament, to deal favourably with us:—That He hath raiſed up in his kind providence, Friends to the cauſe of liberty and theſe colonies. In ſhort, that we have obtained redreſs—"Let the people praiſe thee, O Lord; let all the people praiſe thee!"</p>
            <p>LET us entertain the moſt dutiful and loyal ſentiments with reſpect to the King—rejoice in his upright adminiſtration—the increaſe of his illuſtrious family, as a further ſecurity of our happy conſtitution: And not fail by words and actions, to diſcover that the proſperity of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is a great part of our happineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:010503_0032_0F80186E8598EC20"/>MAY the Britiſh Parliament receive that defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from us that they deſerve; and be convinced by our future conduct, that we aim not at IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEPENDENCY; nor wiſh to deſtroy diſtinctions, where diſtinctions are neceſſary:—That we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in being governed according to the principles of that conſtitution, of which we make our boaſt as Engliſhmen: Yea further, that if it was put to our choice, Whether our connections with Great Britain ſhould be diſſolved? We, the inhabitants of theſe Colonies, would riſe like a cloud, and deprecate ſuch a diſunion.</p>
            <p>LET the names of thoſe Worthies who have openly eſpouſed our cauſe, be had in grateful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance; not only by the preſent, but by all ſucceeding generations.</p>
            <p>BUT I forbear to addreſs you in language that ſeems to imply any want of gratitude and affection to them: And with confidence affirm, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of You, my Brethren, and the reſt of my Countrymen, that your generous hearts would inſtantly prompt you, were your abilities ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, to erect ſtatues of Gold, to the memory of the Right Hon. WILLIAM PITT, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and thoſe other worthy Patriots, who have ſo eminently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted themſelves in the cauſe of liberty and theſe Colonies, on a late occaſion.</p>
            <p>TO conclude. Be it far from us to triumph on this happy event, as tho' we had gained a victory: Or even remotely to hint that our redreſs is forced. Senſible we are that ſome of the friends of theſe Colonies, have gone ſo far, as to riſque their repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:010503_0033_0F801870C87AF5A0"/>
on our becoming behaviour for the future. May they not be diſappointed! But while we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the warmeſt ſenſe of liberty, may we act in every inſtance, in ſuch a manner, that our moſt ſubtle enemies may have nothing to lay to our charge: Unleſs they may deem it a fault, to be inviolably attached to his Majeſty's moſt ſacred perſon; and the royal ſucceſſion in the illuſtrious houſe of Hanover.</p>
            <p>IN fine. May our expreſſions of joy on the day enſuing, be kept within the bounds of decency— let us avoid exceſs, and every unbecoming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, leſt we hurt ourſelves, and offend the God of ſalvation. May the whole iſſue in unanimity and peace; the firmeſt connection, and mutual proſperity of Great-Britain and her Colonies.— May we go on to rejoice in the continuance of our privileges, and glorify God in the abundance of his mercy.</p>
