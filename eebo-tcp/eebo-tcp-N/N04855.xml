         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A general PREFACE giving ſome Account of the AUTHOR, and the following Pieces.</head>
            <p>TO oblige the Reader, I would give a brief Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the very pious, judicious and renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Author</hi> of the following Pieces, from ſome of the beſt Authorities.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Cotton Mather</hi> tells us, He was born at <hi>Towceſter</hi> near <hi>Northampton</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> Nov. 5. 1605; went to the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge</hi> when he was 15 Years of Age; was there converted to God in 1624, and took his Degree of Maſter of Arts; afterwards engaged in the Miniſtry; ſet Sail from <hi>Harwich</hi> in <hi>England</hi> for <hi>New-England</hi> in the latter End of 1634, but by a great Storm was driven and forc'd to land at <hi>Yarmouth</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and liv'd the Winter at <hi>Baſtwick</hi> in that County; in the Spring of 1635 went up to <hi>London;</hi> in <hi>July</hi> ſailed from <hi>Graveſend;</hi> Oct. 3, arrived at <hi>Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton;</hi> whence in a Day or two his Friends at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> who had come before, gladly fetched him, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came their Paſtor till he died.</p>
            <p>But at preſent, waving his Life and Character by <hi>that learned Writer;</hi> I ſhall now rather give the Reader a ſhorter Hiſtory drawn by thoſe Rev. and famous Men, Mr. <hi>William Greenhill</hi> of <hi>London</hi> and Mr. <hi>Samuel Mather</hi> of <hi>Dublin;</hi> (the latter at our <hi>Cambridge</hi> having lived divers Years under his Miniſtry) in their <hi>Preface</hi> to Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi>'s Sermons of <hi>Ineffectual hearing the Word,</hi> and <hi>Subjection to Chriſt in all his Ordinances,</hi> publiſhed at <hi>London</hi> in 1657, as follows—</p>
            <q>
               <pb facs="unknown:006067_0003_10274FD851184C08"/>
               <p>Concerning the <hi>Author;</hi> it were worth the while to write the Story of his Life.</p>
               <p>It is needleſs to ſpeak in his Commendation: <hi>His Works praiſe him in the Gates.</hi> They that knew him, knew he had as real Apprehenſions of the Things of God, and lived as much with God and with his own Heart, and more, than the moſt of Chriſtians do.</p>
               <p>He had his Education at <hi>Emmanuel College</hi> in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> [in <hi>England.</hi>] The Converſion and Change of his Heart was wrought betimes when he lived in the Univerſity, and enjoyed Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi>'s Miniſtry: Whereby God had the very beſt and Strength of his Parts and Years for himſelf.</p>
               <p>When he was firſt awakened to look after Religion, having before ſwam quietly in the Stream of the Times, he was utterly at a Loſs which Way to take; being much moleſted with Suggeſtions of <hi>Atheiſm</hi> (in the Depths whereof <hi>Junius</hi> was quite loſt for a Time) and moved and tempted to the Ways of <hi>Familiſm</hi> alſo. He read the Books of <hi>H N</hi> among the reſt; where meeting with this Paſſage, <q>That a Chriſtian is ſo ſwallowed up in the Spirit, that what Action ſoever the Spirit moves Him to, ſuppoſe Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he may do it, and it is no Sin to him;</q>— <hi>This was enough:</hi> For being againſt the Light of natural Conſcience, it bred in him an utter Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of thoſe looſe and vile Ways and Principles e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after. This Advantage he alſo had, that Doctor <hi>Tuckney</hi> was then his Tutor; whom he acquainted with his Condition, and had his Direction and Help in thoſe miſerable Fluctuations and Straits of his Soul. Happy is the Man whoſe Doubtings end in Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: <hi>(Nil tam certum quam quod de Dubio certum)</hi> But when Men arrive in <hi>Scepticiſm</hi> as the laſt Iſſue of all their Debates and Thoughts of Heart about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, it had been good for ſuch if they had never been born.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="unknown:006067_0004_102750271B8CDB40"/>
After his Heart was changed, it was obſerved, that his Abilities of Mind were alſo much enlarged; <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,</hi> though it be chiefly the Art and Rule of the <hi>Will</hi> yet raiſing and perfecting the <hi>Underſtanding</hi> alſo: Which we conceive came to paſs by this Means, that the Fear of God fixed him and made him ſerious, and taught him to <hi>meditate,</hi> which is the main Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the Underſtanding. Therefore ſuch as came to him for Direction about their Studies, he would often adviſe <hi>to be much in</hi> MEDITATION: Profeſſing, <hi>that having ſpent ſome Time in Meditation every Day in his Beginning-Times, and written down his Thoughts, he ſaw Cauſe now to bleſs God for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was aſſigned to the Work of the Miniſtry at a ſolemn Meeting and Conference of ſundry godly Miniſters about it: There were to the Number of <hi>Twelve</hi> at the Meeting, whoſe ſolemn Advice was, that he ſhould <hi>ſerve the Lord in the Goſpel of his Son;</hi> wherein they have been the Salvation of many a Soul: For upon this he addreſt himſelf to the Work with that Reality and Seriouſneſs in wooing and winning Souls, that his Word made deep Impreſſions, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never fell to the Ground.</p>
               <p>He was <hi>Lecturer</hi> a while at <hi>Earles-cone</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> which we take it was the firſt Place of his Miniſtry: where he did much Good: And the People there, though now it is long ſince and many are gone, yet have a very precious and deep Remembrance of him, of the mighty Power of God by him to this Day. [i. e. 1657] But [Dr.] <hi>W. Laud</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> ſoon ſtopt his Mouth and drove him away, as he did many other godly Miniſters from <hi>Eſſex</hi> at the ſame Time. After this he lived at <hi>Butterchrome</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> at Sir <hi>Richard Darley</hi>'s Houſe, till the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity of thoſe Times hunted him thence alſo. Then he went to <hi>Northumberland,</hi> 'till ſilenced there alſo.</p>
               <p>And being thus moleſted and chaſed up and down
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:006067_0005_10274FDC31E7D930"/>
at <hi>Home,</hi> he fled to <hi>New-England;</hi> and after ſome Difficulties and Delays by great Storms and Diſaſters at Sea upon the Sands and Coaſts of <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> which retarded his Voyage till another Year, he arrived there at laſt; where he was Paſtor to a precious Flock at <hi>Cambridge</hi> about <hi>Fourteen Years.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Manner of Preaching was cloſe and ſearching, and with Abundance of Affection and Compaſſion to his Hearers. He took great Pains in his Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for his Publick Labours; accounting it a curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Thing to do the Work of the Lord negligently: And therefore ſpending uſually <hi>Two</hi> or <hi>Three whole Days</hi> in preparing for the Work of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> had his Sermons finiſhed uſually on <hi>Saturday</hi> by Two of the Clock. He hath ſometime expreſt himſelf thus in publick;— <q>
                     <hi>God will curſe that Man's Labours that lumbers up and down in the World all the Week, and then upon</hi> Saturday <hi>in the</hi> Afternoon <hi>goes to his Study; when as God knows that Time were little en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough to pray and weep in, and to get his Heart in Frame,</hi> &amp;c.</q> He affected <hi>Plainneſs</hi> together with <hi>Power</hi> in Preaching; not ſeeking Abſtruſities, nor liking to hover and ſoar aloft in dark Expreſſions, and ſo ſhoot his Arrows, as many Preachers do, over the Heads of his Hearers.</p>
               <p>It is a wretched Stumbling-Block to ſome, that his Sermons are ſomewhat ſtrict, and as they term it le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal. Some Souls can reliſh none but meal-mouth'd Preachers, who come with ſoft and ſmooth and tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Words: <hi>(Byſſina verba byſſinis viris:)</hi> But theſe Times need <hi>humbling Miniſtries,</hi> and bleſſed be God that there are any: For where there are no <hi>Law-Sermons,</hi> there will be few <hi>Goſpel-Lives;</hi> and were there more <hi>Law-Preaching</hi> by the Men of Gifts, there would be more <hi>Goſpel-Walking</hi> both by themſelves and the People. To preach the <hi>Law,</hi> not in a forc'd affected Manner, but wiſely and powerfully, together
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:006067_0006_10275029EE3C8858"/>
with the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> as Chriſt himſelf was won't to do; (<hi>Mat.</hi> v. and elſewhere) is the Way to carry on <hi>all Three together;</hi> [viz.] <hi>Senſe of Miſery,</hi> the <hi>Application of the Remedy,</hi> and the <hi>Returns of Thankfulneſs and Duty.</hi> Nor is any Doctrine more comforting than this humbling Way of God, if rightly managed.</p>
               <p>His Sickneſs began with a ſore Throat, and then a Quinſy, and then a Fever, whereof he died, <hi>Aug.</hi> 25. 1649. This was one Thing he ſaid upon his Death-Bed; "LORD, <hi>I am vile, but thou art righteous:</hi>" And to thoſe that were about him, he bid them; <hi>Love</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>dearly; That little Part that I have in him, is no ſmall Comfort to me now.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>Thus far thoſe Rev. and Eminent Men, Mr. <hi>William Greenhill</hi> and Mr. <hi>Samuel Mather</hi> in 1657. By Miſtake indeed they ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> was 46 or 47 Years old when he died: For preciſely ſpeaking, he was but 43 Years, 8 Months, and 20 Days. So great a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs did he make in Sanctity and divine Knowledge; and in the midſt of many Moleſtations and abundant miniſterial Labours, he compoſed and did ſo much, and grew in ſuch Eſteem and pious Fame, in ſo ſhort a Time; that I cannot but reckon him one of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Men of his Age.</p>
            <p>On this Occaſion, I would recite a Paragraph in the Life of the very Rev. Mr. <hi>James Fraſer</hi> of <hi>Brea</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> publiſhed at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in 1738; as follows— <q>The Lord hath bleſſed the Reading of <hi>Practical Writings</hi> to me; and thereby my Heart hath been put into Frame, and much Strength and Light got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: Such as <hi>Iſaac Ambroſe, Goodwin,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gray,</hi> and very much by <hi>Rutherford</hi>'s above others: But moſt of all by Mr. <hi>Thomas Shepard</hi> of <hi>New-England</hi> his Works; he hath by the Lord been made the <hi>Interpreter one of a Thouſand;</hi> ſo that under CHRIST I have been obliged to his Writings as much and more than to any Mean whatever, for wakening,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006067_0007_10274FE05951C408"/>
ſtrengthening and enlightening my Soul; the Lord made him a Well of Water to me in all my Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Straits.</q>

            <p>Both the <hi>Two former</hi> of the following Pieces, viz. The <hi>Firſt Principles</hi> and <hi>Select Caſes,</hi> were publiſhed together in one Book, firſt at <hi>London</hi> and then at <hi>Endin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> in 1648. They have been alſo printed ſince at divers Times in both thoſe Cities, and always went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. But all have many Miſtakes, both in <hi>Figures, Words,</hi> and eſpecially <hi>Pointings</hi> that much obſcure the Senſe and puzzle the Reader: All which, from the two firſt Editions mentioned, with two others both at <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> upon comparing them together, I have ſo corrected; that <hi>this,</hi> which as far as I find, is the firſt in <hi>America,</hi> is the moſt correct Edition extant. But in the <hi>Letter</hi> containing the <hi>Caſes,</hi> for the Reader's clearer View, I have taken the Liberty to inſert the <hi>Titles of the ſeveral Caſes and Queſtions,</hi> as they here appear in <hi>Italica</hi> at the Heads of their ſeveral Subjects. In the <hi>Title-Pages</hi> of the two firſt Editions, the <hi>Letter;</hi> is ſaid to be ſent from <hi>New-England</hi> to a Friend in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> Yet by ſeveral Paſſages at the Beginning and End, which I have <hi>italica'd,</hi> compared with the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts above, it plainly appears, 'twas wrote in <hi>England</hi> a little before his coming away, and probably at <hi>Baſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> in the Spring of 1635.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Diary</hi> ſucceeding—That it is the genuine Compoſure of this excellent Divine, appears from an old <hi>Manuſcript</hi> found at <hi>Cambridge</hi> above <hi>Thirty Years</hi> ago, and aſcribed to him as in the <hi>Title-Page:</hi> As alſo from this further Evidence, that the Sentiments, the Spirit, the Stile and Manner of Expreſſion are intirely Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi>'s; and whoever will take the Pains to compare this with his Sermons on the <hi>Parable of the Ten Virgins</hi> and other Writings, will clearly ſee their exact Similitude: And above all yet, that Dr. <hi>Cotton Mather,</hi> in drawing Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi>'s Life, about <hi>Fifty
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006067_0008_1027502D1BD52AF8"/>
Years</hi> ago, had this Part at leaſt of the Diary before him, from whence he has tranſcribed ſeveral Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs: As of <hi>Dec.</hi> 1. 1640; <hi>Mar.</hi> 19, <hi>April</hi> 10, <hi>July</hi> 10, <hi>Aug.</hi> 15, <hi>Oct.</hi> 10, and <hi>Nov.</hi> 3, 1641. But the Reſt were never publiſhed 'till now.</p>
            <p>And here it is an Act of <hi>Juſtice</hi> to conſider, that the Rev. Author penning theſe <hi>retired Meditations</hi> only for <hi>his own private Uſe;</hi> we muſt ſuppoſe, he did not write with ſo much Guard and Correctneſs of Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as if he were preparing for the publick View: or he would no Doubt have rectified ſeveral Paſſages and rendered them more clear and accurate. Yea tis likely they would have appeared more correct and clear, if we could have found the <hi>Author's Manuſcript.</hi> The <hi>equitable</hi> and much more the <hi>candid</hi> Reader will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make juſt and kind Allowances. And the very Name of Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> is enough to recommend theſe his <hi>private Thoughts</hi> to thoſe who have read his Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, are ſeriouſly concerned for their Salvation, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of being deceived in Matters of eternal Moment.</p>
            <p>As for a further Account of the <hi>Diary;</hi> ſee the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Preface</hi> immediately before it. And though the Rev. <hi>Writer,</hi> from his ſingular Modeſty, forbid his Name to be ſubſcribed; yet being now deceaſed, I may take the Freedom to tell the Reader, it was that extraordinary Perſon, Mr. <hi>David Brainard;</hi> who died the 9th <hi>Current,</hi> in the 30th Year of his Age, to the great Grief of thoſe who knew him, both among the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Indians.</hi>

                  <head>To the CHRISTIAN READER.</head>
                  <p>THIS holy Letter of that ready <hi>Scribe</hi> of Chriſt's Kingdom, [Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> of <hi>New-England</hi>] is ſo full of Grace and Truth, that it needs no other Epiſtle commendatory than it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Yet ſeeing the Lot is unexpectedly fallen upon my Pen, to give it a Superſcription that it may <hi>paſs current</hi> from Hand to Hand; I do heartily in the firſt Place, dedicate it to <hi>thee, thou bleeding-troubled-Spirit,</hi> as a choice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial Friend, and Interpreter, <hi>one</hi> of a Thouſand, that doth not only ſpeak thy Heart, but by the Comforter (whom Chriſt hath promiſed to ſend) to thy Heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It may be this Paper preſent</hi> is ſent on Embaſſy, from Heaven, on Purpoſe, to ſet thy Houſe in Order, to unty thy Boſom-Knots, to bind the ſtrong Man, and caſt him out of thy Doors; that thy Heart may be once again ſet at Liberty, to ſerve the Lord thy God in thy general and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Calling, whoſe Service is thy Freedom. What is here ſent by this Ambaſſador of Chriſt, (who is <hi>now the Voice of one crying in a Wilderneſs</hi>) to a weary and heavy laden Soul in this Iſland; I had rather it ſhould appear to thy Judgment in the ſerious Reading, and to thy Conſcience in the home Application thereof, than from my Opinion of it: Therefore I ſhall only add (as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of this Letter) <hi>certain ſelect Caſes, propoſed and reſolved</hi> in the ſeveral Paragraphs thereof, as they lye in Order in the Pages following, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>BEing deſired to peruſe and give our Opinion of the <hi>Reſolutions</hi> in <hi>this Letter</hi> now preſented to thy View, We muſt confeſs, they appeared to us very precious. For we have ſeldom ſeen Acuteneſs, Profoundneſs, and Godlineſs, ſo eminently, equally, and happily matched. There are in Chriſt's School divers Forms, Elementaries, and Men of exerciſed Wits. The Scholar propoſing theſe Caſes was no Puny, and he was happy in meeting with a Teacher ſo able for Reſolution. Therefore, who ever reads and heeds, will not repent of his Labour. But the more knowing the Reader is, and the more experienced in the Ways of Chriſt, the more De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light may he take in, and the more profit may he reap by theſe pious and profound Reſolutions.

                  <p>I Dare not multiply many words in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging and profeſſing my own unfitneſs and inſufficiency to yield your loving and moſt welcome Letter, that ſatisfaction which both Yourſelf deſire, and it deſerves: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet will I be ſo unfaithful to you; ſeeing your expectation puts me to reply: Neither ought I (I think) be ſo unſerviceable to JESUS CHRIST, who in you, and by you, beckens to me to take this call to write to you, and not to neglect ſo fair a ſeaſon; ſeeing eſpecially <hi>it may be poſſible my dying Letter to you, before I depart from hence,</hi> and return to him, as <hi>not knowing but our laſt diſaſters and Sea-ſtraits,</hi> of which I wrote to you, <hi>may be but preparations for the execution of this next approaching voyage.</hi> Yet our eyes are to the hills, and our deſires are your prayers: and at this time my endeavour ſhall be in reſpect of your ſelf, to break open that light to you, and to prepare it to you, with that brevity I may, and with what plainneſs I am able: beſeeching the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who muſt be when all fails, the wonderful

Counſellor, to give you the ſpirit of revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that after you have ſuffered, a while by theſe outward temptations, doubts, fears, deſertions, diſtractions, which the Letter men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he would make you perfect, ſtabliſh, ſtrengthen, and ſettle you. And this I verily think will be the unexpected, yet happy, joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and moſt glorious end of them: For ſince I have obſerved and ſeen the lamentable ruins of the ſoul, and ſeeming graces of many men, by being rock'd aſleep in a quiet ſtill calm, eaſy performance of duties; without ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waking temptations and tumults within, which it ſelf complains of: I ſay ſince I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved what a deal of mud is in the bottom of ſuch ſtanding Pools, and what a deal of filth is in ſuch Motes, which are inwardly at eaſe, and not emptied from veſſel to veſſel; next unto the donation of the Lord Jeſus to a man, I have accounted ſuch tumultuous heart-ſtorms and uproars, together with the fruitful ſtrange effects of them, the ſecond mercy. For I never ſaw that man kept from ſecret putrefaction and corruption, that was not uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſalted with ſuch temptations, (eſpecially in a Chriſtian's firſt Apprentiſhip) which uſually preſerve him entire till death. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Dear Sir, faint not; for Jeſus Chriſt will raiſe a world of bleſſings out of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Chaos and confuſions. But I make haſte to anſwer, before your reply to my firſt Letter. Your complaints are many.</p>

                        <hi>CASE I.</hi> Of ordering the Thoughts in Civil Employments.</head>
                     <p>Your <hi>firſt Trouble</hi> is, concerning your <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbances in Civil affairs,</hi> by the ſecret injection of <hi>religious thoughts;</hi> ſo that you know not how to follow the one, without hazard of grieving the ſpirit, and breaking your peace, in not maintaining and nouriſhing at the ſame time the other: and hence being drawn to go two ways at the ſame time, which you cannot well do, your heart is diſquieted, and your peace much interrupted.</p>
                     <p>This of yours, puts me in mind of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of an honeſt, yet plain man, to an able Miniſter once, who in bewailing his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him, among other miſeries, this was not the leaſt; <hi>(viz)</hi> that he was exceedingly troubled with good thoughts, ſo that he could not follow his place, unleſs very oft he did ſtand ſtill and pray, for fear of grieving the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, (as he thought) and loſing his ſeaſon of being heard in heaven: For ſaid Conſcience oft unto him, How doſt thou know but this may be thy accepted time, and if thou doſt not take it, it may be thou ſhalt never have it again? I have forgot the Miniſter's anſwer; but I am ſure in theſe complaints you go not alone: I have lately known one very able, wiſe, and godly, put upon the Rack in theſe kind of thoughts, by him, that envying God's people's peace, knows how to change himſelf
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:006067_0018_10274FED6299A2B0"/>
into an Angel of light. For it being his uſual courſe in the time of his health, to make a Diary of his hourly life, and finding much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by it, he was in conſcience preſt by the power and deluſion of Satan, to make and take the ſame daily ſurvey of his life in the time of his ſickneſs; by means of which, he ſpent his enfeebled ſpirits, caſt on fuel to fire his ſickneſs: and had not a friend of his covin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him of his erroneous conſcience, miſlead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him at that time, he had murderd his body, out of conſcience to ſave his ſoul, and to preſerve his grace. And do you think theſe were the motions of God's ſpirit, which like thoſe <hi>Locuſts, Rev.</hi> 9.9, 10, had faces like men, but had tails like Scorpions, and ſtings in their tails.</p>
                     <p>Your thoughts I know, are not likely to produce the ſame effects; although you have the ſame efficient: and becauſe you ſay your peace is hereby diſturbed by ignorance, as not knowing what to do in the midſt of theſe civil actions and theſe religious thoughts; I conceive that <hi>two</hi> things are to be ſadly conſidered of, for the cure of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt</hi> how to know <hi>when ſuch religious pious thoughts come from God's ſpirit,</hi> and when from the Devil transforming himſelf into an Angel of light; or from a well-melted ſtirring conſcience, yet blind. For when you know they come from God's ſpirit, you are bound to nouriſh them; but when not, you are not bound to embrace nor comply with them. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Learn <hi>how your ſoul is
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:006067_0019_10275040CD503FB8"/>
to behave and carry it ſelf in Civil employments:</hi> For when you ſee how you do, and may ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God in following them, your ſpirit will not be ſo unquiet, if at any time you embrace not the ſuggeſtions of the other.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. For the <hi>firſt</hi> briefly; all good motions and thoughts are not the ſpirit's motions: as may thus appear.</p>
                     <p>There be <hi>three</hi> things chiefly by which we may diſcern the motions, ſuggeſtions, and thot's which come from God's ſpirit: all which concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring together in a good action, or thought, or word (not one alone) will make diſcovery whether they are from God's ſpirit or not.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If it be ſuggeſted for God's ends, its from God's ſpirit: to act ſo high as for a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural end, muſt ariſe from a ſupernatural prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, which only is God's ſpirit. Phariſaical actions were for a double ſelfiſh end, and hence not from God's ſpirit, but nature, and their own ſpirit, 1. To be ſeen of men, 2. If they did any of them abhor this, yet it was to purchaſe and gender in their own minds an opinion of holineſs before God: and hence Chriſt gives them this Item, in giving Alms, that they ſhould not let their right hand know what their left hand doth: for many men will do good acts, leaſt they ſhould by the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of them, think themſelves hypocrites, and ſo be troubled for them. Chriſt would have us not to take notice of what we do for ſuch an end.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If they be animated and quickned from
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006067_0020_10274FF193C971E8"/>
God's command, for the higher meaſure of holineſs, for glorious ends, without a warrant from the Word, is the more ſordid ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Chriſt healed the leper: when he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him with anger to tell no man; he, no queſtion for a good end, publiſhed the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle the more: this was a good motion, but it was ſinful in him, being croſs to Chriſt's command. When Chriſt would have waſhed <hi>Peter</hi>'s feet, he had many thoughts that came into his head, concerning his own vilenſs, and Chriſt's glory; and had a good end and meaning in his anſwers; yet his humility croſſing Chriſt's command, the Lord profeſſeth againſt it and him for it, that he had no part in him, if he ſhould go on in it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. God's Spirit ſets a man on work in due ſeaſon: For let the duty be commanded and rightly directed, yet if it be not done in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it is not from God's Spirit: Hence Pſal. 1. <hi>The righteous bring forth fruit in its ſeaſon:</hi> and hence <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>words ſpoken in ſeaſon, are as apples of Gold:</hi> and hence we read in Eccleſiaſtes, of <hi>a time and ſeaſon for every thing under the Sun.</hi> And therefore when there is a ſeaſon of God's appointing for civil things or buſineſs; it is not ſeaſon now to be moleſted or perplexed in it, by the injection and evocation of thoſe thoughts which we think to proceed from the Spirit of GOD. I know indeed, that the Spirit of God doth enable a man to do whatever good he doth; but as Grace makes Nature ſometimes to ſerve, ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006067_0021_102750425682C970"/>
Nature brings Grace into captivity, (which <hi>Paul</hi> complains of, Rom. 7.) and makes Grace to ſerve it. To exhort and reprove another for ſin, is from God's ſpirit that it is done; but to reprove at an unſeaſonable time, its from ſinful corruption, abuſing God's grace, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Sampſon</hi> to grind. Its from the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of a knife to cut well; but to cut my finger with it when I ſhould be cutting my meat with it ariſeth not from the end of the knife, nor from the intention of him that made it; ſo to think of good things, it is from the ſpirit, I grant; but to think of them in ſuch a ſeaſon that God ſets you a work to mind and follow other occaſions, its from the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of God's ſpirit, and your own peace. For as it is a ſin to nouriſh worldly thoughts when God ſets you a work in ſpiritual heavenly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; ſo it is, in ſome reſpects, as great a ſin to ſuffer your ſelf to be diſtracted by ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual thoughts, when God ſets you on work in civil, yet lawful, employments: ſuch thoughts, I conceive, are but the leaven of Monkiſh holineſs, if they divert you from your lawful affairs, when the Lord calls you to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them. For the Lord never calls you to two divers employments at the ſame time, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you make the one to be a means to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the good of the other; which ſuch pious thoughts in ſome civil employments do; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no piece of Chriſtian wiſdom or honeſty to turn round in wordly employments ſo long till by giddineſs we fall down, but by ſecret
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006067_0022_10274FF34019C990"/>
ſteps, ever and anon to look up to heaven and to behold the face of God, to whom only therein we are to approve our ſelves. But yet it ſeems your thoughts are ſo far from being ſubſervient the one to the other, that you are diſtracted and moleſted, and your piece interrupted, and your Chriſtian courſe made troubleſome, and an heavy burthen; which ſurely cannot be by the yoke of Jeſus Chriſt: therefore you muſt firſt bring your troubles in this particular to this iſſue; either you may follow your Civil affairs, and nouriſh theſe thoughts as helps to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain your peace, and make you heavenly minded in them, (and if they ſerve ſufficiently to ſuch an end, why are you troubled with them?) or elſe you cannot follow God comfortably in civil actions, unleſs you baniſh from your thoughts which do ſo miſerably diſtract you; and then why do you fear you ſhall grieve God's ſpirit, if at the ſame time you do not give entertainment to them, the unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of which, ſpeaks plainly they came not from the ſpirit's ſuggeſtions; beſides their hindrance of comfortably walking with God, which the Employments themſelves can never hinder.</p>
                     <p>But you will ſay, when is the <hi>ſeaſon</hi> of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing ſuch thoughts?</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, Entertain thoſe thoughts as, it may be, you have done ſome friends, who came to you at that time you had buſineſs with ſtrangers, whom you love not ſo well as your friends; you have deſired them to ſtay a
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:006067_0023_10275046CB8C8330"/>
while, until you have done with the other, and then you have returned to your friends, and when the other hath been ſhut out of the doors, the other hath had the welcome, and hath lodged with you all night; and thus you have grieved neither, but pleaſed both. It is ſo in this caſe, Worldly employments are our ſtrangers, yet they muſt be ſpoke with: Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious thoughts and practices are our friends, theſe come unto us while God calls us to parley with the other, you cannot ſpeak with both at one time, in one place, without much perlexity: take therefore this courſe, make much of the good thoughts, but parley not with them till your buſineſs is done with ſtrangers; and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards evening, which is your ſeaſon, ſet ſome time apart every day for meditation, and then make them welcome; then conſider and ponder well what was ſuggeſted to you in the day time, and ſift every good thought to the bran, for then is your ſeaſon, and after that let them ſup and lodge with you all night, and keep the houſe with you every day. And ſurely when the Lord Jeſus ſhall ſee what a friend you ſhall make of his Spirit thus, and how wiſely you walk therein, you ſhall not need to fear any grieving of it, at unſeaſonable times: nay (I ſay) you will moſt fearfully grieve his Spirit, if you parley with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſuggeſtions of it at unſeaſonable times. <hi>What thou doſt, do it with all thine heart,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon.</hi> Eccleſ. 9.</p>
                     <p>Therefore when you are to pray, confer, or
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:006067_0024_10274FFA4691C340"/>
meditate, do it with all your mind, and all your thoughts, and all your ſtrength. So when God calls you to worldly employments, do them with all your mind and might; and when the ſeaſon of <hi>meditation</hi> comes, take it: which glorious ordinance of God, although many chriſtians uſe it occaſionally, and againſt ſome good time, or when they have leiſure meeting with them, yet to ſet ſome time apart for it in a ſolemn manner every day, and that in conſcience as we do for prayer generally, where is the man to be found that does thus? Thoſe men that thus neglect their ſeaſon of muſing and entring into parley with God's ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit daily, may be well ſaid to grieve the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: through the neglect of which Ordinance, God's ſpirit is as much grieved by profeſſors in <hi>England,</hi> as by any courſe I know. The Lord awaken us: but I have run too far al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in this firſt part of my anſwer.</p>
                     <p>For the <hi>ſecond</hi> means, <hi>viz. How the ſoul is to carry it ſelf in civil employments,</hi> that ſo you may not think you do for better, when you liſten to good thoughts as you mention.</p>
                     <p>I ſay but <hi>two</hi> things;</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Learn to follow them out of an aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reſpect to the eye, preſence, and command of Jeſus Chriſt: and to do what you do in civil buſineſſes, as the work of Chriſt: When you are riding, or making up breaches between man and man, and then think I am now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the work of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Seeing your ſelf thus working in worldly
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006067_0025_10275049A84733F8"/>
employments for him, you may eaſily apprehend that for that time God calls you to them, and you attend upon the work of Jeſus Chriſt in them; that you honour God as much, nay more by the meaneſt ſervile worldly act, than if you ſhould have ſpent all that time in medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, prayer, or any other ſpiritual employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to which you had no call at that time. It is noted therefore by ſome of <hi>Peter</hi>'s wives mother, that when Chriſt had healed her of her fever, ſhe ſate not down at table with Chriſt in communion with him, which, no queſtion, was ſweet; but miniſtred at the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ran too and fro, and ſo ſerved him, and acted for him; wherein ſhe ſhewed more love, and gave him more honour, <hi>viz.</hi> in that mean ſervice, and in acting for him, than in having communion with him. Now if the Lord would out of his abundant goodneſs, ſet the ſoul in ſuch an acting frame for him, and if it could do its worldly employments, as the work of Chriſt, and ſee how greatly it honours Chriſt in attending on him; Oh what peace ſhould a chriſtian enjoy, notwithſtanding all his diſtractions every day! and how eaſily would ſuch devout thoughts you ſpeak of, be repell'd like darkneſs before the light? For the noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe good thoughts you ſpeak of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting themſelves againſt the mean and baſe outſides of civil affairs, makes you ready to honour the one, when you are call'd to ſerve the other: but now, by ſeeing you do the work of Chriſt Jeſus in them, you ſhall hereby
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:006067_0026_10274FFC033BBE58"/>
ſee a glory in the meaneſt ſervice you perform in civil affairs, and this will make you cleave unto them. But I have ſaid too much about repelling of good thoughts in theſe times, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in men have ſo few; though, it may be, little enough to ſatisfy you.</p>

                     <p>Your ſecond trouble is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That your heart is kept from being <hi>humbled for ſinful diſtractions,</hi> that hinder and interrupt the ſpiritual performance of holy duties, and that for <hi>two</hi> reaſons: <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe they be volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and accidental. <hi>Secondly,</hi> becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not break the covenant between GOD and your Soul, being but infirmities.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> For the latter clauſe concerning breach of covenant, together with the other.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. I ſay, not only infirmities do not, but the greateſt ſins cannot make a breach of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant between GOD and the ſoul that is once really (not nominally) wrapt up in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace. Indeed groſs ſcandalous ſins, nay infirmities, when they are given way to, and not reſiſted, may keep the ſoul from the fruition, for a time, of God's covenant, but never from the eternal <hi>jus</hi> and right unto it. For as the <hi>Habit</hi> of faith or grace gives a man a conſtant right to the promiſe and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which need ever remains, which habit
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006067_0027_1027504B319C5CF8"/>
ever laſts, I. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.9. ſo the <hi>Act</hi> of ſaith or grace gives a man fruition of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and the benefit of the promiſe. And hence by the acting and venting of ſome ſins, wherein there is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> the neglect of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of grace, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> that is really in covenant with God, may be deprived of the fruition of it; yet ſeeing the ſeed of God, and the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of grace ever remains, he cannot by any ſin break his covenant: For the covenant of grace is abſolute, wherein the Lord doth not only promiſe the good, but to begin, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and fulfil the condition abſolutely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect of ſin; <hi>ex parte creaturae.</hi> Indeed if God's covenant of grace did (as that of works) depend upon man to fulfil the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, having ſufficient grace to fulfil it, then groſs ſin might well break the covenant: but ſeeing GOD hath undertaken to fulfil the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant abſolutely, notwithſtanding all the evils and ſins of the ſoul, no ſin can poſſibly break that knot and covenant, which ſo firm and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute love hath once knit. And therefore, if this be a good argument, infirmities cannot break covenant: What cauſe have I to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for them? ſo as to ſay, It is thy mercy Lord that I am not conſumed for them, (as you write;) you may upon the ſame ground ſay ſo, If the Lord ſhould deſert you, or you forſake the Lord, and ſo fall into the fouleſt ſin, which I ſuppoſe corrupt conſcience dares not be ſo bold as to think or allow of.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I ſay the leaſt ſins or infirmities do break
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006067_0028_10274FFEEE5027C8"/>
the firſt covenant of works: and hence you do not only deſerve, but are under the ſentence of death, and curſe of God, immediately after the leaſt hair's breadth, ſwerving from the Law by the ſmalleſt ſin, and moſt involuntary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental infirmity. According to the tenour of the law, <hi>the ſoul that ſinneth ſhall dy;</hi> and, <hi>curſed is he that continueth not in all things of the Law,</hi> Gal. 3.10. The leaſt ſin being, <hi>(ex parte objecti)</hi> in reſpect of God againſt whom it is committed, as horrible and as great as the greateſt. For it being an infinite wrong, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſhonour of an infinite Majeſty, there can be no greater wrong than an infinite one; unleſs you can imagine a thing greater than that which is infinite: And therefore in this reſpect, there is as much venom and miſchief done againſt God in the leaſt, as in the greateſt ſin: And therefore it, and whoſoever commits it, deſerves death for it, as if they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the fouleſt ſin in the world. And therefore after the leaſt and ſmalleſt infirmities, you may from hence ſee what cauſe you have freely to be humbled, and to confeſs for them how worthy you are to be deſtroyed; yea, even to look upon your ſelf as lying under the ſentence of the law and death immediately after the commiſſion of them, and ſo to mourn bitterly for them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, a <q>Chriſtian that is under the covenant of <hi>grace,</hi> is not within the covenant of <hi>Works,</hi> that Bond is can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled, the laſt Will muſt ſtand; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006067_0029_1027504E0BD84D88"/>
he being out of that covenant, no ſins of his can be ſaid to break the covenant; for no man can be ſaid to break that law under which he is not, and which he is not bound to keep.</q>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, every believer has a <hi>double being or ſtanding,</hi> and ſo there may be put upon him a double reſpect.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Firſt, he may be conſidered as united to, and having a <hi>ſpiritual being on Chriſt;</hi> and ſo it is true, he is under Grace, and the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, and not under the Law, nor the covenant of works; and hence not being under the Law, nor bound to keep it as a covenant of life (though it be <hi>a rule of life</hi>) no ſin can condemn him, there being <hi>no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to them that are Chriſt Jeſus, Rom.</hi> 8.1. But as Chriſt is above condemnation, and law, and death, and curſe, ſo is he. And this truly underſtood, is the foundation of a Chriſtian's joy and peace, and glory, every day; yet ſo, as tho' ſin doth not condemn him, yet he has good reaſon to ſay, it is mercy, and meer mercy, Lord, that I am not conſumed, that I am not condemned. For ſin is the ſame; nay grace and God's love aggravates ſin; for to ſin againſt the law, deſerves death without recovery; but to ſin when grace has received me, and loved me; when the blood of Chriſt has been ſhed abundantly, to deliver me from ſin; Oh this makes the moſt ſecret ſilent ſin a crying one! So that if you do conſider this well, you may ſee what little cauſe there is to have your
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:006067_0030_102750031A18F820"/>
heart riſing againſt the deepeſt humiliation for the leaſt ſin, though you be in Chriſt, and under grace: For as <hi>Daniel,</hi> when he was put into the Lions den, had not he cauſe to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that he was not torn in pieces by them? and why? becauſe it was not from any defect on their parts to tear him in pieces, but from the omnipotent power, and mercy, and grace of his God, that muzzel'd their mouths; ſo though no Lion can tear, though no ſins can hurt or condemn a Chriſtian, as he is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in Chriſt, yet, has not he cauſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs and wonder, and ſay, Lord, it is thy meer grace and mercy that it is not ſo? Which is the act of humiliation your letter ſaith you can hardly come unto; and why? not becauſe God's grace puts any leſs evil in ſin, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is meerly grace that keeps it from ſpitting that venom which otherwiſe it would.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Secondly, A Chriſtian may be conſidered in reſpect of his <hi>natural being in himſelf;</hi> and thus he is ever under the Law, and as oft as he ſinneth, under the ſentence of death, and as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>by nature</hi> even <hi>we</hi> (juſtified, quickned) <hi>are the children of wrath as well as others.</hi> And thus after the leaſt involuntary accidental ſin, you may eaſily ſee what cauſe you have to lie down deeply humbled, mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the ſentence of death, and God's eternal curſe, as a condemned man going to execution, to feel that fire that ſhall never go out; looking upon your ſelf as you are in your ſelf, a forlorn caſt-away every moment; and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:006067_0031_1027505235206338"/>
this truly underſtood is the foundation of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian's ſorrow, ſhame, and confuſion of face, ſelf-loathing, ſelf-forgetting, ſelf-forſaking, and condemning every day. And, believe it Sir, it is no ſmall Piece of a Chriſtian's ſkill and work, to put a difference between himſelf and himſelf; himſelf as he is in Chriſt, and ſo to joy and triumph; and himſelf as he is grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his firſt root, and ſo to ſorrow, and loath, and condemn himſelf: ſo that, to wind up all that I have ſaid, look upon your ſelf as in Chriſt, you may ſay theſe involuntary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities do not, ſhall not, condemn me.</p>
                     <p>But Lord it is Grace, Grace that it is not ſo, and this is Evangelical humiliation. Look again upon your ſelf, as you ſtand on your own bottom, and live in your own nature, and ſo you may ſay after the leaſt infirmity, I have now broken a moſt holy and righteous Law, and therefore I am already condemned: O woe is me, I have already undone my ſelf by mine iniquity: and this is Legal humiliation, which ſerves for mortification, as the firſt for vification. I know it is very difficult to bring the heart to acknowledge freely it deſerves death after ſo ſmall an involuntary offence. But when the Lord reveals two things, <hi>Firſt,</hi> himſelf in his glory, <hi>Secondly,</hi> how the leaſt ſin ſtrikes him; I perſwade my ſelf, the vileſt heart can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be forced to confeſs how juſt God ſhould be in his ſevereſt proceedings againſt him. And withal conſider, the more involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary any ſin is, the more ſtrong and natural
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006067_0032_10275005ECC699C8"/>
it is, and the more natural, the more horrible; as to be a natural Thief is far worſe than to be a deliberate thief, who ſometimes ſteals: and therefore, good Sir, take heed of looking no deeper, nor ſeeing no further than the bare act, and unvoluntarineſs and accidentalneſs, and ſuddenneſs of your infirmities: for if you do, you look through the wrong end of the glaſs, and they will appear ſo ſmall, that you will find it a very tough work to bring your heart conſentively, to ſay, (if I may ſay and uſe your own phraſe) It is thy mercy Lord that I am not conſumed for them: But look upon them as indeed they are, in reſpect of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite glory you ſtrike, doing the greateſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs to God by them, and (which makes them the viler) as they are ſo ſtrong you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not remove them, and ſo horrible as that it is natural to you to commit them,  and ſurely you will not through grace, find ſuch thoughts haunt you long: Not but that they will be, haply, riſing and tempting, but never alway vexing and prevailing. Satan's ground reaching as far as the <hi>minds</hi> of God's people; and therefore ſo far he may come, and there he may walk; (for he came into the mind of innocent <hi>Adam,</hi> nay <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> by his ſuggeſting temptations:) but the <hi>heart</hi> is Chriſt's peculiar poſſeſſion and purchaſe; and if he ſhall ſtill there offer to come in and vex you, and prevail againſt you, and to lodge his ſuggeſtions this or any other way with you, you have Law and Chriſt on your ſide, by this little light now given you, to caſt him out.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>third</hi> thing that troubles you, is the <hi>diſ-ranking of the Perſons in the Trinity:</hi> For though you think the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is <hi>God,</hi> yet you have not ſo high a repute of him, as of the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Son</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſeth himſelf to God the <hi>Father</hi> in all his prayers and acknowledgments, in a more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate manner than unto the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and therefore you would know if the word <hi>Father</hi> (as in <hi>the Lord</hi>'s <hi>Prayer</hi>) includes not the <hi>Unity</hi> in <hi>Trinity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this briefly conſider <hi>three</hi> things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Without all queſtion, the ſame God which lies under that relative property of <hi>Father,</hi> is the ſame God with the God-head of the Son, and the God-head of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not three Gods: and therefore the God-head of the <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> are not excluded, but included in the God-head of the <hi>Father,</hi> when we look upon the <hi>Father</hi> as God, in <hi>the Lord</hi>'s <hi>Prayer,</hi> or any where elſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But ſecondly, the <hi>Father</hi> as Father, is never taken for the ſame <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in Scripture; nor the <hi>Son</hi> as Son, is taken for the <hi>Father;</hi> nor the Holy Ghoſt as Holy Ghoſt, is at any time taken for the Son: For it is a rule in Theologie, though the <hi>res ſubſtrata,</hi> the thing that lies under the Relative property (<hi>viz.</hi> the God-head) of every perſon, be common and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:006067_0034_1027500778F43B10"/>
communicated; yet the ſame God-head conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as clothed with his Relative property (as <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi>) it is not common, but peculiar. For the God-head of the <hi>Father</hi> as Father, is not the God-head of the <hi>Son</hi> as Son, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Hence it follows, that when <hi>Chriſt</hi> addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelf to the <hi>Father</hi> as Father in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is not becauſe <hi>He</hi> is either a diverſe or greater God than the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> but it is for <hi>two</hi> other reaſons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe the <hi>Father</hi> as Father, received primarily the wrong that ſin did againſt his work of creation: For the <hi>Father</hi> being the firſt perſon in order and creation, the firſt tranſcient act as (<hi>election</hi> and <hi>reprobation</hi> were the firſt immanent); hence this work is atri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted chiefly to God the <hi>Father,</hi> in reſpect of our orderly apprehenſion: and hence man ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning then when he was only made, this is chiefly attributed to be againſt the <hi>Father,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his work appeared to be chiefly there; and not againſt the <hi>Son,</hi> for his work chiefly appears in <hi>redemption,</hi> he being the ſecond Perſon, and this the ſecond main and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful work; neither againſt the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> for his work chiefly appears to us in <hi>application,</hi> being the third Perſon, and this the third main act that ever God will do, or ſhow forth to the world in this life. Hence God the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> receiving to our apprehenſion, the wrong in creation by ſin, <hi>He</hi> is the Perſon that is to be ſatisfied, and not the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:006067_0035_10275056998F0F70"/>
hence <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in all his prayers has a moſt ſpecial eye to <hi>Him,</hi> and not to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> (as Holy Ghoſt) becauſe <hi>He</hi> came into the world, by his death, and interceſſion, and ſtrong cries to ſatisfie God the <hi>Father,</hi> and not God the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> as a third Perſon. And hence it is ſaid, 1. John 2.1, 2. <hi>If any ſin, we have an Advocate with God the Father,</hi> (not God the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi>) becauſe He was, to our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the Perſon wronged: and hence we are, after ſins committed, chiefly to eye the <hi>Father</hi> in our prayers, and to go to him for pardon with <hi>our Advocate</hi> with us; becauſe to whom of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is chiefly offered, from him chiefly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and reconciliation is to be expected.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> addreſſeth himſelf chiefly in his prayers to God the <hi>Father,</hi> becauſe he is the original and firſt cauſe of all good; becauſe he is the firſt Perſon in order of ſubſiſting, and therefore firſt too in the manner of conveying. I know the God-head is the original of all good: but conſider the Perſons one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo the <hi>Father,</hi> is ever the firſt in ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is the laſt in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation; for all good comes from the <hi>Father, James</hi> 1.17, through the <hi>Son</hi> by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And hence in all our prayers we are to look for all good from the <hi>Father,</hi> for his <hi>Son</hi>'s ſake, to be conveyed us by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> and hence it is ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 6.10. <hi>No man comes to me but whom the Father draws:</hi> Why? It is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate office and work of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> to draw and apply the ſoul unto <hi>Chriſt:</hi> why then
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:006067_0036_1027500BBA70A5C8"/>
is it ſaid, <hi>Unleſs the Father draw?</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe that which was perfected and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> was intentionally and by way of purpoſe and decree begun originally by the <hi>Father:</hi> and this is that which Chriſt's words have chiefly reference unto, <hi>viz,</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> through the <hi>Son</hi> by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> draws.</p>
                     <p>But I have waded too far in this Divinity, the clear knowledge of which is reſerved for us in heaven: But thus much to ſatisfie you. Yet the word <hi>Father</hi> in <hi>the Lord's Prayer,</hi> I conceive under correction, as it doth not exclude any perſon of the God-head, ſo its chiefly ſet down there, not ſo much to denote the <hi>Perſon</hi> of the Father, as the <hi>Affection</hi> of <hi>God</hi> as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to us his Sons by Chriſt: which we are to believe in our firſt approaching to our prayers, to be as, nay to tranſcend the affection of any Father to his Son; when we come to call upon him for thoſe <hi>ſix</hi> things which the Petitions ſet down for thoſe <hi>three</hi> ends, Kingdom, Power, and Glory, which the Prayer concludes withal.</p>

<pb n="23" facs="unknown:006067_0037_102750596EEE4840"/>
as it appears in many other, ſo in this caſe you put. Look as it is with every man when God awakens him effectually, he firſt ſeeks to his kitchin phyſick to ſave himſelf by his duties, praying, mourning, reforming, endeavouring, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, working, before he will ſeek out to the Phyſician, and to Chriſt to ſave him: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was natural to <hi>Adam</hi> to ſeek to live by his working, it is natural to every Son and branch of that root, to ſeek to ſave himſelf by doing as well as he can, or as God gives him the ſtrength and grace: So it is here. It was natural to <hi>Adam</hi> to depend upon, and go to God immediately, as a creature to a Creator, as a Son to go nakedly to God as a Father: Chriſt was not then known nor ſeen: ſo it is natural to every man when rectified Nature is ſtirred up, to go immediately to God. It is grace in the <hi>ſecond Covenant</hi> that reveals and draws to Jeſus Chriſt, and to God by Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25.</p>
                     <p>For cure of this diſtemper, ponder but theſe <hi>three</hi> things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Clearly convince the ſoul that the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, inviſible, and moſt holy God, that dwelleth in an unapproachable light, has ſet out himſelf to be ſeen, or made himſelf only viſible in Jeſus Chriſt; ſo that he would have no man look upon him any other ways, than as he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed himſelf in his Son: In whom (though in all other creatures his <hi>veſtigia</hi> and footſteps are to be ſeen) as he is <hi>God,</hi> the face of God is to be ſeen; which no creature is able to behold,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:006067_0038_1027500E98F3CD58"/>
ubt there, being <hi>the brightneſs of his glory, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon, Heb.</hi> 1.3. And as he is <hi>man,</hi> the very heart of God, both in reſpect of Affection, and Will is to be ſeen; So that in and through Jeſus Chriſt, eſpecially his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, the glory of the great God breaks out like the Sun through the clouds moſt bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in reſpect of us; and therefore in and through his human nature we are only to behold God, in whom all that a Chriſtian deſires to know, is to be ſeen, which is the Face and Heart of ſo dear a Friend, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.9, 10. For we know by too lamentable experience, how the whole world vaniſhing in their ſmoaky thoughts of the glory of God, as he is conſidered in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and not able to conceive or retain the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him; did hence invent and ſet up Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as fit objects for their drunken ſtaggering underſtanding to faſten upon, and to be limited with; and hence adored God before theſe, (as our Popiſh Hypocrites do before the Altar) and in theſe and at theſe, as Papiſts do in reſpect of their Images. Hence the Lord to cure this inveterate natural malady, hath in the <hi>ſecond Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> united himſelf to man Chriſt Jeſus; through whom we are both able to our everlaſting won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derment to ſee him, and alſo here bound only to behold him; who as he is a fit handle for our faith, ſo he is a fit object for our weak minds to behold the glory of the moſt high God in. Wherefore then do you offer to go unto God without Chriſt, when as you are not ſo much as to look upon God, but as he appears in Chriſt?
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:006067_0039_1027505B0E076670"/>
Is not the human nature of the Lord Jeſus more eaſie to be ſeen and conceived of, than the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible unlimited eternal God-head?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. See evidently that there is not any dram or drop of God you have, eſpecially in God's ordinances, but it iſſues from the blood, and is purchaſed by the interceſſion, and delivered unto you by the hand of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.7, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7.25. <hi>John</hi> 5.22. You ſhould never have heard the ſound of the goſpel, nor ever have had a day of Patience, nor ever have heard of God's ordinances to find him in; nor ever have been comforted, quickned, enlarged, affected by God's Ordinances, were it not for Jeſus Chriſt; the efficacy of whoſe blood, and power of whoſe glorious interceſſion, doth at the very inſtant you feel any good in God's Ordinances, prevail with God the Father for what you feel: For the Father loveth the Son, and <hi>has put all things into his hands, Joh.</hi> 3.35; <hi>that all men might honour the Son;</hi> Joh. 5.22, 23. all the three Perſons plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting chiefly for the honour of the ſecond: ſo that you may ſee, nay you are bound to believe, at the time you feel your heart ſavingly affected in any ordinance now; the Lord Jeſus, who is at the right hand of God in heaven, who is now in his glory, now he remembring me a poor worm on earth, now I feel the fruit of his death. O what a miſerable forlorn wretch had I been, were it not for Jeſus Chriſt? Mercy could never have helped, enlightned, comforted, quickned, aſſured, enlarged me; and Juſtice could never have relieved my dead, bloody, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing

loſt Soul, had it not been for Jeſus Chriſt; whoſe Spirit, power, grace, comfort, preſence, ſweetneſs, I taſte, drink, and am ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied abundantly with, and now do enjoy.</p>
                     <p>Oh Sir, methinks the ſad meditation of this, ſhould make you, in all God's ordinances, where you are apt to ſay you go immediately to God, to haſten ſuddenly in your thoughts, affections, praiſes, to Jeſus Chriſt. Nay, methinks you ſhould ſpeedily have your heart elevated and lifted up to Jeſus Chriſt, and ſay, I receive this, and taſte this from Jeſus Chriſt. Oh, but this is but a taſte of the honey-comb with the end of my rod; and if this preſence of Chriſt's Spirit I feel now be ſo ſweet, what is Himſelf then?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Labour for increaſe of love and familiarity with Jeſus Chriſt, by taking notice of him, by coming often to him, by muſing daily on his love, as on a freſh thing, baniſhing ſlaviſh falſe fears of his forgetfulneſs of you, and want of everlaſting love towards you: and then you know love will carry you ſpeedily to him: <hi>amor meus pondus meum.</hi> Nay, grant that you have been a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to Chriſt, yet reſtore the love of Chriſt to life again in your ſoul; and when you come to his ordinances, where he dwells, your Soul will make its firſt enquiry for him; neither will it be ſatisfied till it has ſeen him, as we do them we love, towards whom we have been greateſt ſtrangers.</p>

And thus the Soul floats above water, yet fears it ſhall ſink at laſt, notwithſtanding all that God

every ſin; but finding it ſelf to grow worſe and worſe, and perceiving thereby that he doth but ſtir, and not cleanſe the puddle, and that it is not amending of nature that he muſt attain to, but he muſt believe, and make a long arm to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and apprehend the Lord Jeſus, (which ſo few know, or ever ſhall enjoy) and hereby quench the wrath of God; I ſay, finding he cannot do thus, no, nor no means of themſelves can help him to this, hereupon he is forſaken of all his ſelf-wiſdom and of all his vain hopes, and now ſits down like a deſolate widow, comfortleſs, and ſorrowful, and thinks there is no way but death and hell, and the wrath of a diſpleaſed God to be expected. And if any come and tell this Soul, of God's mercy and pity to ſinners; Ay, ſaith he, it's true, he is even infinitely merciful unto them who are rent from their ſins, and that can believe; but that I cannot do, and am ſure ſhall never be able for to do; and therefore what cauſe have I but to lie down in my ſorrow, and to expect my fatal ſtroke every moment? Reply again upon this Soul, and tell him, that though he cannot believe, or looſen his heart from ſir, yet that the Lord has promiſed to do it, that he will ſubdue all his iniquity, and he will pardon all his ſin, and that he will cauſe men to walk in his ways,  True, ſaith the Soul again, he will do thus for his own people, and for them he has choſen, but I never had dram of grace in my heart, and there is no evidence that the Lord is mine own, or that I am his: Here again the Soul lies down, until the Lord diſcovers to the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:006067_0044_1027501B802110D8"/>
Soul that he will do theſe things for ſome that have no grace, or never had grace; for theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes were made to ſuch.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon the Soul thinks thus; Theſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are made for ſome that are filthy; for why ſhould God pour clean water upon them? for ſome that be hard-hearted; for why ſhould he promiſe to take away the ſtony heart from them? &amp;c: and if unto ſome ſuch, and I being ſuch a one, why may not the Lord poſſibly intend and include me, ſeeing he has not by his promiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded nor ſhut me out? Indeed I dare not ſay he will, but yet how do I, or men, or Angels know, but yet I may be one? Hereupon Hope is raiſed to life again: ſeeing God has undertaken the work for the vileſt, it is poſſible he may do it for me, now when I am vile and can do nothing for my ſelf. And thus you may ſee the <hi>firſt end</hi> and uſe of abſolute promiſes, to be as it were, twigs to uphold the ſinking Spirits of hopeleſs, helpleſs, diſtreſſed Souls.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>Second end and uſe</hi> of them is this; To create and draw out faith in Jeſus Chriſt in the promiſes. For as the Law begets Terror, ſo the promiſes beget Faith. Now no conditional promiſe firſtly begets Faith; becauſe he that is under any condition of the Goſpel, in that man there is a preſuppoſed faith. It's God's abſolute promiſe that firſtly begets faith; for <hi>Faith is not aſſurance, but the coming of the whole Soul to Chriſt in a Promiſe, John</hi> 6.35: And then the Soul believes in Chriſt, when it comes to Chriſt: Now this God works in the Goſpel. (1) The Soul is
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:006067_0045_102750634DEDEB00"/>
raiſed up by Hope: And being raiſed, it (2) comes to Chriſt, which is Faith, by vehement unutterable deſire: And being come to him it (3) Embraceth Chriſt by Love: and thus the match is made, and the everlaſting knot is tied.</p>
                     <p>Now as you have heard, the abſolute promiſe works hope of relief from Chriſt: and if it works hope, it alſo works a deſire, or coming to Chriſt by deſire. Oh! that thou Lord wouldſt honour thy grace, thy power, thy love, thy promiſe, in helping me a poor caſt-away! And thus Faith is created, as it were, by this abſolute promiſe: for it cannot but move the heart of any one that ever felt his want, to cry mightily to the Lord for help, if he has any hope, ſeeing the Lord has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to do it for ſome. Oh ſaith the Soul, that thou wouldſt do it for me! And ſurely, were it not for this abſolute promiſe of God, no Soul would deſire, becauſe he would have no hope to be ſaved, or to ſeek for any thing as from the hands of God. And thus you ſee <hi>to what end</hi> God makes and <hi>to what uſe</hi> a Chriſtian may put theſe abſolute Promiſes.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. For the <hi>ſecond</hi> thing, <hi>viz. How and when a Chriſtian may apply theſe Promiſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I <hi>anſwer,</hi> every Chriſtian is either,
<list>
                           <item>1. Within Covenant with God, and knows it; or</item>
                           <item>2. Within covenant with God, and knows it not; or</item>
                           <item>3. Out of covenant indeed, for his preſent ſtate and condition, yet he is in <hi>fieri,</hi> or making towards it.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="32" facs="unknown:006067_0046_1027501D0CD87F78"/>
1. If he be in <hi>Covenant, and knows it,</hi> then you may eaſily perceive how and when he ought to apply promiſes unto himſelf: For he may boldly conclude; If God be his God, then all the Promiſes of God ſhall be made good unto him; if he be a Son of God he may boldly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge at all times at the hands of God, (nay, in ſome reſpects, at the hands of Juſtice it ſelf) the fulfilling of God the Father's will delivered in the ſeveral Legacies of the promiſe bought by the blood, and ſealed by the ſame blood of Jeſus Chriſt, that they may and ſhall be made good unto him: that is clear.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If he be <hi>in Covenant, and knows it not,</hi> and queſtions hence whether God is his or not, and conſequently, whether the promiſes belong unto him; then this rule is to be obſerved: let him ſo ſue and ſeek for the good of the abſolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe until by reflecting upon his own acts, herein he perceive himſelf adorned and dignified with the qualification of ſome conditional promiſe; and then if he can find the condition or quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication within himſelf, then as you judge and write, he may conclude, that the conditional promiſe belongs to him; and if one promiſe, then all God's promiſes, and therefore that abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute promiſes are his own, becauſe at leaſt one conditional promiſe is. For no unregenerate man is within the compaſs of any one conditional promiſe of grace, unleſs you will ſay he is under the everlaſting love of God; the Promiſes of grace being but the mid-way between the eternal purpoſe and decree of love, and the glorious cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:006067_0047_102750652735C7E0"/>
execution of that love in time. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe being the break-day of God's moſt glorious love, which muſt ſhine out in time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But here you will ſay is the difficulty, <hi>viz,</hi> how I ſhould ſo ſeek for the good of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute promiſes, as therein to find my ſelf within the compaſs of ſome conditional one?</p>
                     <p>I <hi>anſwer,</hi> It is done chiefly by <hi>three acts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. By being <hi>humbly contented,</hi> that ſeeing the Lord has abſolutely Promiſed, to work and do all for the Soul he intends to ſave, even when it can do nothing for it ſelf, and that he has taken the work into his own hands, ſo that it is his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, offer, office and honour to do all; that therefore you <hi>lie down,</hi> not ſluggiſhly, but <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly at the feet of God, and contented to have him to be your God,</hi> and for ever to be diſpoſed of in any thing by God, if he will fulfil his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in you; contented to part with any ſin, if he will rend it from you; contented to know any truth, if he will reveal it to you; contented to do any duty, if he will enable you; contented to ſhine bright with all his glorious graces, if he will create and maintain them in you; contented to bear any evil, if he will lay his hand under your head, and thereunto ſtrengthen you; and ſo ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord promiſed to undertake the work for ſome, put out the work, and put over your Soul, to him, that he would fulfil the good that his covenant promiſeth in your ſelf. Now when you do thus, which, no queſtion, you and many a Soul doth, many times reflect upon this act, and ſee if you cannot or may not find your ſelf by
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:006067_0048_102750B95BEADDA8"/>
it under the condition of ſome conditional pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; and if you do, then are you bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all God's promiſes are and will be <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen</hi> unto you. Now that you do ſo by this act, it ſelf ſpeaks plainly: For how many condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional promiſes are made to the meek? <hi>Bleſſed are the meek, Mat.</hi> 5; and to the humble, whom God will raiſe up? For this is not <hi>ſaving Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> to be quietly contented to be or to do, or to bear any thing that the Lord will have me from mine own ſtrength and feeling; but to be, to do, or to bear any thing that the Lord will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> me, if the Lord enable me. Many a ſtout heart would gladly have Chriſt; but if he cannot have him in his own terms, <hi>viz,</hi> Chriſt and his luſts, Chriſt and the world too, or by his own ſtrength and power; he will have none of him, but deſperately caſts him away, and ſaith, what ſhall I look after him any more? I cannot pray, I cannot believe, I cannot break this vile and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly will, this ſtony adamant heart: thus the pride of a man's heart works. Now he that is truly meekned and humbled, he is contented gladly to have God his God, and Chriſt his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and that upon Jeſus Chriſt, his own terms. Firſt, <hi>on his own covenant:</hi> now what is that? why it is this, I will give you the good, and work in you the condition too; I will give you my ſelf, and therefore will not ſtick to give you an eye to ſee, and a heart to receive too. This is the covenant: now hereupon a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Soul accepts of Chriſt according to his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, on his own terms thus, <hi>viz,</hi> Upon the
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:006067_0049_102750682D5116E8"/>
condition Lord, that thou wilt humble me, teach me, perſwade me, cauſe me to believe, and in every thing to honour thee; Lord, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented gladly and joyfully to have thee; do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what thou wilt with me. Juſt as a ſick man tells his Phyſician, who comes not to him on theſe terms, If you will make your ſelf half whole, then I will cure you, and do the reſt for you; but being utterly unable to cure, or to know how to cure himſelf, he tells his Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; I am content you ſhould begin and perfect the cure, and ſo honour your ſkill and love in me, to be contented to take any thing if you will give it me, and if I offer to reſiſt that, you ſhould bind me, and ſo do any thing with me.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>ſecond act</hi> is, <hi>earneſtly to long and come to Chriſt, to cleave unto Jeſus Chriſt by fervent and ardent deſire,</hi> that he would make good thoſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute promiſes to you, ſeeing that they are made to ſome, and that they do not exclude you. For when you ponder well, and ſee what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful great things the Lord promiſeth to ſome, whoſe heart cannot but be ſtirred up to ſay, as that woman in another caſe, <hi>Lord, give me of that water to drink!</hi> and as they in the fifth of John, <hi>Lord evermore give us that bread!</hi> Now doing this, reflect upon this <hi>Second</hi> act, and ſee if unto it no conditional promiſe belongs, and you ſhall find an affirmative anſwer from the word. For what is this longing after the good, not of <hi>ſome</hi> (which many hypocrites do) but of <hi>all</hi> the promiſes, but that which the Scripture calls <hi>Thirſting?</hi> who are commanded to <hi>come
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:006067_0050_102750BD9D1E0290"/>
and drink of the waters of life freely,</hi> Iſa. 55.1, 2; and <hi>Hungring?</hi> to which all good things are promiſed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.6; and <hi>Coming</hi> to Chriſt, as I ſpake even now? who has given this as the firſt fruit of eternal election, and which kind of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple he will never caſt away, <hi>John</hi> 6.37. Now when you ſee theſe promiſes belonging unto you, why dare you not conclude but that all theſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute ones are your's alſo?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The <hi>third act</hi> is this; Seeing God hath promiſed abſolutely ſuch good things in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Covenant, but hath not ſet down the time when, or how much grace he will give, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only he can help; therefore <hi>look up, and wait upon the Lord in the uſe of all known means, until he makes good what he hath promiſed to do, and perform, and work for you.</hi> Say, as beggars that have but one door to go to for bread, if none hear, or hearing help not, lay themſelves down at the door, and ſay; I will wait here, I am ſure I periſh if I go away, or quarrel with them in the houſe becauſe they help me not ſo ſoon as I would; and therefore I will wait, for it may be their compaſſions may move them as they paſs by to help me. So do you. Many a Soul comes and longs for the good of the Promiſes; but if the Lord do not ſpeedily help him, he goes with diſcouragements, fears, and diſcontents, or deſpair, or ſin away, and ſaith one of theſe two things, either I ſhall never have help, or I come not truly, and hence I feel no help. Oh remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that bread is only to be had at the door, to be diſtributed when the Lord ſeeth need, not
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:006067_0051_1027506C51956760"/>
when we would, or think we have need; and therefore wait here and ſay, if I periſh here, I will at the feet of God, and at the feet of the promiſes and covenant of God, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Now reflect upon this act, and ſee if you may not find ſome conditional promiſe annexed unto it; which ſurely you may, and I will name you but two, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.29, 30, 31; and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.4. And if the conditional promiſe belongs to ſuch a Soul, you may eaſily conclude the abſolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are your own: and the chiefeſt uſe you are to make of them when you know them that they are your own, is to preſs God to make them good daily to you; and to believe as verily and really, as if you had the performance of them, that they ſhall. It may be you will aſk me, <hi>How ſhall I know whether I have theſe conditions truly in me?</hi> I <hi>anſwer,</hi> ſincerity is a very wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing grace; the frequent meditation of the Scripture will give you much light, to judge of the ſincerity of them, and that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 1. Cor. 2.12, I ſay unto you, <hi>We have not received the ſpirit of the World, but of God, whereby we know,</hi> (or may know) <hi>the things that are freely given to us of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. If he be <hi>out of the covenant, but yet God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to work with ſome common work of his grace upon him;</hi> all that I would ſay to him, and all the uſe he can make of ſuch abſolute promiſes, conſiſts in theſe things;</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Let him conſider the <hi>Freeneſs</hi> of God's promiſe, whereby he may be ſtirred up to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſome hope it may be made good to him in
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:006067_0052_102750BF271708C8"/>
time. For the promiſe is very free and large, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding none (except thoſe that ſin unpardonably) be their ſins and natures never ſo vile before God; and yet not including any by name, for that is in the conditional promiſe: And hence ſuch an one is to make this uſe of it; Who knows but the Lord may have pity upon me in time? and ſo hang thy hope upon him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Let him conſider the <hi>Worth</hi> and <hi>Price</hi> of God's promiſe, bought by blood, and for which ſome men would give a thouſand worlds for the benefit and comfort of; and hereby raiſe up his heart, as by the <hi>Freeneſs</hi> of it to hope, ſo by the <hi>Price</hi> of it to eſteem of the thing promiſed, above pearls, and all the honour and pomp of the world.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Let him conſider the <hi>Fulneſs</hi> of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, which is a plaiſter as big as his ſore, juſt anſwerable to all his wants, nay infinitely more large than his wants. And ſurely <hi>theſe three</hi> things will draw his heart to long for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; and then you know what is conditionally promiſed and bequeathed to them that <hi>thirſt:</hi> For ſimilitude is the ground of love. Now when the Fulneſs of the Promiſe is ſeen, there will appear ſuch a ſutableneſs and fitneſs of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to his ſoul, that he cannot but long for it.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is very true, there is abundance of wildneſs in our hearts, which naturally ſeek to have their liberty abroad, and cannot endure to be pent in the narrow room of holy performances, extraordinary duties, &amp;c, no more than children can be pent up from their play. And hence we are weary of them, and glad to think of their departures and ends. And truly it is one of the moſt grievous miſeries that a holy heart can feel, and I beſeech the Lord of heaven and earth to keep you, and me, and all his for ever, while we are here in our valley, under the ſenſe of ſuch diſtempers, as our greateſt miſery. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me thought it was a ſolemn ſweet ſpeech of an honeſt man to his friend; who ſeeing him oppreſſed with ſuch diſtempers as you mention, and perceiving him to droop under them, he came chearfully to him, and ſuddenly ſaid unto him; <q>I can tell you good news, the beſt that ever you heard, <hi>viz,</hi> Aſſoon as ever you are in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:006067_0054_102750C2498FE810"/>
you ſhall ſerve Chriſt without wearineſs:</q> Which words well thought on, revived the man. That which I would ſpeak, with as much tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of compaſſion as I am able, to you, I refer to theſe things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That a child of God is never uſually weary of the duty, but rather of his vile heart, to think of, and to look upon; that in the duty <hi>Chriſt's yoke is eaſie, and his burthen light,</hi> to him that takes it on his neck and puts his Soul under it. The duty nakedly conſidered in it ſelf, is glorious in his eyes, and ſweet to his Soul; and hence ſometimes never well, but when he conſiders his dead, blind, barren, and ſenſeleſs heart, that he is to carry to the duty, and that he fears, and has felt will abide with him in the duty: Oh! this grieves, here the Soul pincheth. An Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite is weary of the duty: a child of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiceth in it; but he is weary of his ſin, and unſavourineſs and wearineſs in the duty. I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelf Sir, that you may ſoon miſtake your ſpirit herein; you think you are unwilling to come to the duty; and are weary of it, when indeed, it is your glory, joy, and love; but it is becauſe you fear you can do it no better, that troubles you, that you have ſuch a vile heart in it. And if your trouble be from hence, the good Lord increaſe it in you daily: and withal, bleſs the Lord, and ſay, <q>Lord though I am weary of my vile heart, in theſe days of humiliation, in theſe Sabbaths; yet I bleſs thee, the days and duties themſelves thou knoweſt are dear unto me; It is not Lord becauſe I am weary
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:006067_0055_10275070B3B42138"/>
of thy word, but becauſe I can do it no better, I am weary of my ſelf, and this vile heart:</q> Here is much love in ſuch a ſpirit to the Lord. And believe it, Sir, your love wants not it's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compences; and remember that the Lord reſpects you not according to your duties done, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your love in them, and to them. And therefore thoſe duties you are aſhamed to own, the Lord will not be aſhamed to crown.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Conſider you muſt and ſhall be baited with theſe diſtempers of heart, ſometimes more, and ſometimes leſs, as long as you live. It is part of <hi>Paul</hi>'s body of death which he muſt carry with him, till he come to bury himſelf.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Thoſe means</hi> which may help you to be freed from them (a little at leaſt) are theſe among many.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Be but truly and really, not by fits and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſenſible of them: men in deep miſeries, are not unwilling to be helped out.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Judge ye not rigorouſly of God, as though he were a bloody auſtere God; as he did of his maſter, whoſe talent he had, and hence never improved it: but look upon God as having a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's heart and affection towards you in the meaneſt and greateſt performances; which is double, either to give you ſtrength to do what you cannot, <hi>(I can do all things through Chriſt;)</hi> or having come to him for it, to accept of what you would do for him, as if it were done: And this will make you joy in the pooreſt performance, that though it be never ſo full of vileneſs, yet the Lord out of his fatherly love, accepts of it as glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
                     <p n="3">

3. Renew <hi>morning</hi> and <hi>evening</hi> by ſad and <hi>ſolemn meditation,</hi> the ſenſe of God's love to you in Chriſt, and in every duty that he ſets you about; and love will love and like the yoke, and make the commandments that they ſhall not be grievous to you.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have <hi>briefly done</hi> with <hi>your new troubles;</hi> which you mention, you ſay, becauſe you may not have the like opportunity of writing again. It may be ſo, and therefore I have deſired to ſatisfie you, which I beſeech the Lord himſelf to do.</p>

                        <hi>Next</hi> you come to <hi>reply</hi> to <hi>my firſt Letter,</hi> of which I have kept no copy, as I never did of any, and hence may and do forget what I writ then unto you. So much light as your Letter lends me to bring things to mind, I will gladly take, and be more brief in anſwer.</p>
                     <p>QUESTION I. <hi>Strength of Grace how obtained?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You find the <hi>ſtrength of grace</hi> to be got in you rather by <hi>argumentation,</hi> than <hi>inward communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and influence</hi> ariſing from the union to Chriſt: And this troubles you.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I anſwer theſe three things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That as the old ſinful nature is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated from <hi>Adam</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi> to us, without any argumentation; ſo the new nature, which is the food, foundation, and plot of all grace, is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:006067_0057_10275074F5C39878"/>
into us by the <hi>ſecond Adam</hi> when we are united to him, without argumentation. It is only by divine operation. The Lord leave not me, nor any friend I have, to a naked <hi>Arminian</hi> Illumination and Perſwaſion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That to the increaſe of thoſe habits, and drawing out the acts of the new creature, the Lord is pleaſed to uſe moral and rational perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; as in the inſtance you gave, Chriſt died for us, then hence the love of Chriſt conſtrains: But remember withal, it is not the bare medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or ſtrength of reaſon or perſwaſion, that elicits ſuch divine and noble acts in the heart and affection; but it is the blood of Chriſt ſprinkling theſe ſerious mediations, that makes them work ſuch graces in the ſoul; which I might ſhew at large: which blood is the ſalve, though argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is the cloth or leather to which it ſticks, and by which it is applied; but from ſuch lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comes no vertue, all of it is from the blood of Chriſt, which by argumentation heals the Soul. For if it were nakedly in the argumentation to ſtir your heart, and to work ſtrength of grace; what ſhould be the reaſon that ſometimes you are no more moved by all your argumentations, than a mountain of braſs is by the winds? why ſhould the ſame truth affect you at one time, and not at another, when you are as fitly diſpoſed to be affected as at the firſt? Therefore conſider it is not your reaſon and argumentation, but Chriſt's blood that doth all, by as admirable, and yet ſecret operation.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Your union to Chriſt on your part in begun,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:006067_0058_102750C9499D9410"/>
and partly wrought by the underſtanding: and hence the good that you get by it at any time, it is from your union, or part of it at leaſt.</p>
                     <p>QUESTION II. <hi>Of ſpiritual Union.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again you aſk me, whether <hi>Calvin</hi> doth not expreſs fully my thoughts about our <hi>Spiritual Union</hi> in his <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 17.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, I have forgot what he has writ, and my ſelf have read long ſince out of him; and for the preſent I have no books about me where I am; and therefore cannot ſatisfie you in this: neither know I when I ſhall ſeek to find out the book and place: If I have leiſure, I will either write to you, or tell ſome of your friends <hi>before I am gone,</hi> what he hath ſaid or writ that way, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>QUESTION III. <hi>Of the Cure of Atheiſtical Thoughts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again <hi>thirdly,</hi> You deſire me to tell you <hi>how</hi> my ſelf <hi>came to the Cure of Atheiſtical Thoughts?</hi> and whether they did wear out, or whether they were rationally overthrown? &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. At firſt they did wear out, meeting with fruitleſs and dead-hearted company, which was at the Univerſity.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="45" facs="unknown:006067_0059_10275077D7F24F60"/>
2. The Lord awakened me again, and bid me beware leſt an old ſore brake out again: And this I found, that ſtrength of reaſon would commonly convince my underſtanding that there was a God; but I felt it utterly inſufficient to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my will of it, unleſs it was by fits, whenas I thought God's Spirit moved upon the Chaos of thoſe horrible thoughts: and this I think will be found a truth.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. I did groan under the bondage of thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing thoughts, looking up, and ſighing to the Lord, that if he were, as his works and word declared him to be, he would be pleaſed to reveal himſelf by his own beams, and perſwade my Heart by his own Spirit of his Eſſence and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which if he would do, I ſhould account it the greateſt mercy that ever he ſhewed me. And after grievous and heavy perplexities, when I was by them almoſt forced to make an end of myſelf and ſinful life, and to be mine own Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner; the Lord came between the bridge and the water, and ſet me out of anguiſh of ſpirit, (as ſhe prayed for a child) to pray unto him for light in the midſt of ſo great darkneſs: In which time he revealed himſelf, manifeſted his love, ſtilled all thoſe raging thoughts, gave return in great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of them; ſo that though I could not read the Scripture without blaſphemous thoughts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, now I ſaw a glory, a majeſty, a myſtery, a depth in it, which fully perſwaded: and which light (I deſire to ſpeak it to the glory of his free grace, ſeeing you call me to it) is not wholly put out, but remains, while I deſire to walk cloſely
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:006067_0060_102750CDA8ACFE90"/>
with him, unto this day. And thus the Lord opened mine eyes, and cured me of this miſery; and if any ſuch baſe thoughts come (like Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars to my door,) to my mind, and put theſe ſcruples to me, I uſe to ſend them away with this anſwer; <hi>Why ſhall I queſtion that Truth, which I have both known and ſeen?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But you ſay this remedy is good, <hi>viz,</hi> of <hi>Prayer;</hi> but that you cannot uſe it, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally becauſe you queſtion the truth of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yet, dear Sir, give not over this Trade; you will doubtleſs find it gainful, when it may be God hath laden you more with theſe thoughts, and made you loath your ſelf for them. But the thing ſeems ſtrange to me, if I miſtake you not, <hi>viz,</hi> that your heart will not be perſwaded, but that you muſt reſolve your doubts concerning the Perfection of Scripture, not by ſeeking to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monize thoſe paſſages that ſeem to croſs one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but by aſcribing ſome humanity or error, (if I may interpret you) to the penmen; ſeeing St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>We Propheſie but in part,</hi> and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> leaves out the doxology in the Lord's prayer.</p>
                     <p>Sir, if you take theſe thoughts, ariſing from theſe and the like grounds, as your burden, I do not blame you, but pity you in that reſpect; but if your judgment indeed think ſo, I am ſorry you ſhould harbour ſuch thoughts one hour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in doors: for you know that <hi>holy men writ the Scriptures</hi> (but ſo far they might err, but it is added) <hi>as they were inſpired,</hi> or as the Original has it, <hi>as they were moved or carried in the arms
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:006067_0061_1027507960CF5290"/>
of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and ſo how could they err? how could God lie? It is true, <hi>Paul</hi> did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie but in part; and is this an argument, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did not propheſie fully, therefore in ſome things he did not propheſie truly? I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded you will ſay, there are many things my poor thoughts have ſuggeſted to you, as true; and yet I am perſwaded I do in them propheſie, if I may ſo ſay, but in part. The Spirit of God directed the four Evangeliſts to write; yet ſo, as they did not all write what another writ, but in great wiſdom left ſome things doubtful and ſhort in one, which are more clear and full in another: and hence the Doxologie is fully ſet down in one, and not in another; and many reaſons I could ſet you down why, but that is needleſs. I grant you ought not to put up all with a charitable opinion of Scripture; but if you can, by reaſon, reading, and comparing, help your heart to a full perſwaſion, this is Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: But many things you cannot get ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for, by that way and means, but ſtill your Spirit will be left dark and doubtful; What courſe will you here take for reſolution, <hi>which is Scripture?</hi> The Papiſts ſay it is ſo, becauſe the Church has chriſtened it for Scripture; you ſay you will ſee reaſon for it that it is ſo, or elſe you cannot be ſatisfied; then I fear you will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſatisfied. I think, In this caſe therefore <hi>theſe two</hi> things you are to do.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To go to God by Prayer, to give you a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of all your doubts, and by ſome means or other, ſome light to ſee whether this is his word
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:006067_0062_102750CFE5757E28"/>
or not. 2. If this be his word, that he would perſwade your heart of it, that it is ſo: For the leaſt reſolution which <hi>is</hi> Scripture, and which is <hi>not,</hi> is made by the ſame perſwaſion, and ſole perſwaſion of the ſame Spirit that writ the Scripture.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the <hi>Angels</hi> that appeared to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> ſee <hi>Gerard;</hi> and he briefly, I think, will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie you, in your anſwer to the particular ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples about the Scripture ſenſe, and the diſſonancy of them. Only this I will add to the laſt clauſe about theſe things, that if the Scripture be inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt, and that not only in the ſum and ſubſtance of it, but in every word and ſentence of it, which I think you will not doubt of, when you have conſidered it; then I think it will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably follow, that the ſame Spirit of truth is alſo a Spirit of order; and hence the method of various penning of it, is from the Spirit too, which you ſay you ſtick at.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. Again, to the <hi>latter part</hi> of your <hi>third</hi> complaint concerning your ſpirit being bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened with <hi>involuntary infirmities,</hi> as <hi>burdens,</hi> but not as <hi>ſins;</hi> I ſay nothing now, becauſe I perceive by one part of your reply that the Lord has done you ſome good by the firſt anſwer; only it is your grief you cannot fear them, nor condemn yourſelf for them, as damning ſins. For ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of which, I hope this reply to your <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> trouble will give you ſome ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="49" facs="unknown:006067_0063_102750809AC6A128"/>
QUESTION IV. <hi>How to know the Movings of the Spirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again to your <hi>fourth</hi> queſtion, to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe changes you have ſometimes, and <hi>theſe movings of your Spirit,</hi> are not of <hi>natural temper,</hi> or <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Spirit.</hi> It ſeems I did a little miſtake the meaning; becauſe you meant not the main work of grace, but occaſional ſtirrings and mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the heart; as by reading ſome pathetical Letter, your Spirit is moved with joy or ſorrow, which it may be will not be ſtirred at ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time; as by drinking a cup of wine, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is made more chearful and lively, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer theſe <hi>three</hi> things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Firſt, That it is very uſual for natural af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to be raiſed by a natural temper, as by drinking, eating, noveltineſs of the Goſpel. <hi>John</hi>'s candle-flies were raviſhed with the Goſpel: Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are naturally moved ſometimes by a thundring Miniſter, yet never a whit the more grace, &amp;c. And it is a good ſpeech of Doctor <hi>Ames: Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian univerſal grace</hi> (as they deſcribe it) may be the effect of a good dinner ſometimes.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That though the <hi>Being</hi> of grace depends not upon the temper of the body, yet the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of grace, and <hi>many gifts</hi> of grace, together with the <hi>feeling</hi> of it, doth. And hence a good din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and ſometimes wine, to a ſad melancholy (if gracious) heart, may remove <hi>rem prohibentem</hi> that may keep grace, as joy and thankfulneſs, from working; and ſo take the grace and draw it out,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:006067_0064_102750D6D8FA5D08"/>
not create and diffuſe the grace. The Prophet called, you know, for a Miniſtril; which ſome think, and that upon good grounds, was to raiſe up his heavy heart, and make him chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and fit to ſpeak: the body is the inſtrument, which if it be broken, the beſt graces will hardly ſound; but if whole, then they will.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If you would know when theſe things only draw out grace, or make a thing like unto grace in the Soul? I anſwer, by <hi>theſe two</hi> things chiefly.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If it be true grace, it ever makes you <hi>more humble</hi> and vile in your own eyes, and ſay; Lord, why doſt thou give me any deſire to thee, any chearfulneſs in ſerving thee?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It makes you <hi>more thankful,</hi> and to bleſs the Lord that he thus remembers you: For this is a <hi>ſtanding rule,</hi> 
                        <q>What ever comes from nature, and a Man's ſelf, it ever builds up it ſelf, and returns to ſelf again; what ever grace comes from Chriſt, it drives a man out of himſelf, by making him <hi>humble</hi> and draws him unto Chriſt that ſent him, by making him <hi>thankful</hi>
                        </q>. I think all graces, and ſtirrings, and movings that have not this double effect in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, are to be ſuſpected; and if they have, it is dangerous to doubt whether they are true or no.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="51" facs="unknown:006067_0065_102750822883EED8"/>
                        <hi>QUESTION V.</hi> Of ſeeing a Poſitive Providence.</p>
                     <p>Again, Your <hi>fifth</hi> thing about <hi>Providence;</hi> you ſay you cannot ſee a <hi>poſitive</hi> providence, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you do ſee a <hi>negative</hi> providence in all your occaſions, and comforts, and croſſes, you meet withal; as namely, you can thank God for not taking away your life, &amp;c, but you cannot ſee God giving it.</p>
                     <p>I <hi>anſwer,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Conſider what I writ to you at firſt about this queſtion in general.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Ponder ſadly whether any creature or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenance to it, has its <hi>Being</hi> from it ſelf, or from the will and word of God; <hi>viz,</hi> I will have ſuch a man to be, and ſuch a memory to be, &amp;c. I think you will ſay nothing can make it ſelf; therefore here is a <hi>poſitive</hi> providence in having life, liberty, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Conſider whether the ſame will and word that gives it a <hi>Being,</hi> together with all the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances to it, doth not alſo give it <hi>Act</hi> and <hi>Motion.</hi> That it is ſo, I thus demonſtrate; (1) Every creature is made for an <hi>end;</hi> for no wiſe efficient, but works for ſome wiſe end: (2) That no creature can lead it ſelf to its end, if ſinful or irrational: (3) God muſt and doth lead it by its ſeveral acts and movings to that end: Hence (4) Every <hi>act</hi> is determined by God.</p>
                     <p>And although I grant ſome creatures move freely, ſome neceſſarily; yet it is from a <hi>poſitive</hi>
                        <pb n="52" facs="unknown:006067_0066_102750D861461100"/>
will and providence that they move, act and ſee. Therefore you ſee what cauſe there is to ſee a <hi>poſitive</hi> providence in every thing.</p>
                     <p>Concerning <hi>the reſt of your letter;</hi> Oh that I had time and heart to write more; yet I hope I have writ enough for this time, and the Lord knows whether ever more or no. However I thank you heartily for improving me this way of writing, <hi>who have my mouth ſtopt from ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> I wiſh I had more ſuch friends to deal thus with me, and my ſelf more time, and a more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful head and heart to improve my ſelf this, or any other like way for them: For who knows what breathings of God's Spirit are loſt for want of writing, eſpecially when there is no ſeaſon of ſpeaking? Truly Sir, I meet with few that are much troubled in that manner as your ſelf; but they go on in an eaſie, quiet, and very dangerous way: Which troubles, I perſwade my ſelf, keep you awaking, when other virgins are ſlumbring; and after which, I am perſwaded, the Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to uſe you for more than common ſervice, if you wade well through them. However as I ſaid before, be not diſcouraged, or too much perplexed in ſorrow for them: For ſurely, as far as I can gueſs, the Lord is preparing you for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by them I ſhall not forget you, though I never ſee you: And I beſeech you, if you have any ſpark of affection toward me kindl'd by theſe few lines, remember when you are beſt able to pray for your ſelf, <hi>to look after me and mine, and all that go with me on the mighty waters;</hi> and then
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:006067_0067_10275083B6504818"/>
to look up and ſigh to Heaven for me, <hi>that the Lord would out of his free grace but bring me to that good land, and thoſe glorious Ordinances;</hi> and <hi>that there I may but behold the face of the Lord in his Temple,</hi> though he never delight to uſe me there, though I and mine ſhould poſſibly beg there; and that if the Lord ſhould call me to my ſolemn work and ſervice for the good of <hi>his Church and People, and company that go with me, or are gone before me,</hi> that then the Lord Jeſus would reveal his ſecrets to me, and enable me the little time I have to live, to be fruitful to him, and to have larger heart than ever for him. As for your ſelf, I ſhall deſire the Lord to keep you blameleſs and unſpotted in an evil world; and that as he has begun, ſo he would perfect, and crown his divine graces and work in you; and that you may be preſerved from national ſins, which ſhortly bring national and moſt heavy plagues; and that the preſence of the Lord may abide with you, and in you, until the Lord call for you. Remember my kind love to your Father, whoſe name I have forgot, and by whom I could not ſend theſe lines, being then hindred by buſineſs. Now the peace of Jeſus Chriſt be with you, and keep you upright and blameleſs till death. And if I never ſee you more till the laſt and great day, then Farewel, Farewel.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To proceed from both.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How many Perſons learn you from hence to be in GOD?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Three:</p>

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The firſt, is the Father, the firſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in order, begetting the Son. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.7.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Spirit, the third Perſon, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from them both. <hi>John</hi> 15.26.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Are theſe three Perſons three diſtinct GOD's?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> No for they are that one pure Eſſence, and therefore but one God. <hi>John</hi> 1.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10.</p>
                  <p>Q <hi>If every Perſon be God, how can they be diſtinct Perſons, and not diſtinct GOD's?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes, Becauſe one and the ſame thing may have many relative properties, and reſpects of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which in the God-head make diſtinct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. As one and the ſame Man, may be a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one reſpect, a Maſter in another reſpect, and a Scholar in another reſpect.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>If theſe three Perſons be but one GOD, what follows from hence?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That all the three Perſons are Co-equal, Coeternal, ſubſiſting in, not ſeparating from each other, and therefore delighting in each other, glorifying each other. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.30.</p>
                  <p>Thus much concerning GOD.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning the Works of GOD.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The co-operation and diſtinct manner of working of the three Perſons. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. <hi>John.</hi> 5.17.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is his almighty power, whereby he is able to bring to paſs all that he doth will, or whatever he can will or decree. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.6. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.7.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No, for the Unregenerate wanting the Spirit of Life, cannot perfect an Act of Life in Obedience to it: The regenerate having the Spirit but in Part, perform it only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.21.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Lord may threaten and correct them, but his Loving-kindneſs (in covering their Sins in their beſt Duties by Chriſt, and accepting their meaneſt Services ſo far as they are quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his Spirit) is never taken from them. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.31, 32, 33. <hi>Zach.</hi> 3.1, to 8. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.20.</p>

                  <p>When the Nature, the Properties and Effects of this <hi>divine Religion,</hi> which our <hi>LORD</hi> has taught and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified to us, are thus clearly opened and duly repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, this tends to rectify the <hi>Miſtakes</hi> of many Perſons in religious Matters; to prevent and remove many <hi>Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices</hi> Perſons are diſpoſed to receive and entertain againſt Religion, through Miſtakes, either in themſelves or others; (altho' twill ſtill remain a ſad Truth, that Men's Hearts are naturally averſe to the Power of Religion, though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in the moſt agreeable Light.) It likewiſe tends to convince rational and thinking Perſons, who are not given up to Vice and Prejudice, (eſpecially if withall they ſee it duely exemplified, in the Lives of thoſe who profeſs it) that <hi>of a Truth GOD</hi> is in this Religion. By this Means alſo the falſe <hi>Hopes</hi> of <hi>Hypocrites</hi> are like to be detected and diſcovered to their View; and thereby an Opportunity given them to eſcape out of the Snare, that would otherwiſe have proved fatal to their Souls. Nor
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:006067_0101_102750FD5ED543C8"/>
can it fail of affording <hi>Comfort</hi> to thoſe who are truly <hi>Godly</hi> to find their own Religion exactly deſcrib'd, and prov'd to be the Religion of God's Word. Hereby ſome of that Number, who are under grievous Doubts about their own ſpiritual State, and ready to reckon themſelves among the moſt poor and miſerable, may be brought to ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves poſſeſs'd of <hi>the Pearl of great Price.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as it is <hi>always</hi> a Matter of the higheſt Importance to have <hi>true Religion juſtly repreſented</hi> and deſcribed; ſo there are <hi>ſome Times</hi> in ſpecial, wherein <hi>thoſe Means</hi> that have the greateſt Tendency to give Perſons right No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it and ſhew them wherein it's <hi>Eſſence</hi> does indeed conſiſt, in Diſtinction from all <hi>deluſive Appearances,</hi> are in a peculiar Manner ſeaſonable and neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>Such are the Times wherein a Diverſity of Sentiments in Religion greatly prevails among the Profeſſors of it; when many are diſpoſed to lay the Streſs of Religion on thoſe Things which <hi>the Word of God</hi> makes little or no Account of, or perhaps wholly rejects, and to neglect and wholly paſs by thoſe Things wherein the Soul and Eſſence of it is really contain'd.</p>
                  <p>How far this is the preſent State of Religian in ſome Places, and how much Streſs is laid by many upon ſome Things, as being Effects and Evidences of exalted Degrees of Religion, when they are ſo far from being of any Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in it, that they are really irreligious, a Mixture of ſelf Love, Imagination and ſpiritual Pride, or perhaps the Influence of Satan <hi>transformed into an Angel of Light;</hi> I ſay, how much Streſs is laid upon theſe Things by many I ſhall not undertake to determine. But 'tis much to be fear'd, that while God was carrying on a glorious Work of Grace, and undoubtedly gathering an Harveſt of Souls to himſelf; (which we ſhould always remember with Thankfulneſs.) Numbers of others have at the ſame Time been fatally deluded by the Devices of Satan and their own corrupt Hearts.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>It is to be feared that the <hi>Converſions of ſome</hi> have <hi>no

better</hi> Foundation than this, viz. That after they have been under ſome Concern for their Souls a while, and it may be <hi>manifeſted</hi> ſome very great and uncommon Diſtreſs and Agonies, they have on a ſudden, imagined they ſaw <hi>CHRIST</hi> in ſome <hi>Poſture</hi> or other, perhaps on the <hi>Croſs bleeding and dying</hi> for their Sins; or it may be <hi>ſmiling on them</hi> and thereby ſignifying <hi>his Love to them.</hi> And that theſe and the like Things tho' mere Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, which have nothing ſpiritual in them, have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly removed all their Fears and Diſtreſſes, fill'd them with Raptures of Joy, and made them imagine they lov'd Chriſt with all their Hearts; when the Bottom of all was nothing but <hi>Self Love.</hi> For when they imagin'd that Chriſt had been ſo good to them as to ſave them and as it were to ſingle them out of all the World; they could not but feel ſome Kind of <hi>natural Gratitude</hi> to him although they never had any <hi>ſpiritual View</hi> of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Glory, Excellency and Beauty, and conſequently ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had any Love to him for <hi>Himſelf.</hi>—Or that, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of having ſome ſuch imaginary <hi>View</hi> of Chriſt as has been mentioned; in Order to remove their Diſtreſs and give them Joy, <hi>ſome</hi> having had a Paſſage or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps many <hi>Paſſages of Scripture</hi> brought to their Minds with Power, (as they expreſs it) ſuch as that, <hi>Son be of good Cheer thy Sins be forgiven thee,</hi> and the like; they have immediately apply'd theſe Paſſages to themſelves, ſuppoſing that God hereby manifeſted his peculiar Favour to <hi>them</hi> as if mentioned by Name: never conſidering that they are now giving Heed to new Revelations; there being no ſuch Thing revealed in the Word of God as that <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> particular Perſon has, or ever ſhall have his Sins forgiven: nor yet remembring that <hi>Satan</hi> can with a great Deal of ſeeming Pertinency (and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps alſo with conſiderable Power) bring Scripture to the Minds of Men as he did to Chriſt himſelf. And thus <hi>theſe</hi> rejoice upon having ſome Scripture ſuddenly ſuggeſted to them, or impreſs'd upon their Minds; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing they are now the Children of God; juſt as did
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:006067_0103_102750FEF5B90D40"/>
the <hi>other</hi> upon their imaginary Views of Chriſt.— And 'tis ſaid that <hi>ſome</hi> ſpeak of ſeeing <hi>a great Light</hi> which fill'd all the Place where they were and diſpell'd all their Darkneſs, Fears and Diſtreſſes, and almoſt raviſh'd their Souls; while <hi>others</hi> have had it warmly ſuggeſted to their Minds, not by any Paſſage of Scripture, but as it were by a <hi>Whiſper</hi> or <hi>Voice</hi> from Heaven, <hi>That God loves them, that Chriſt is theirs</hi> &amp;c. which groundleſs Imaginations, and Suggeſtions of Satan have had the ſame Effect upon <hi>them</hi> that the Deluſions before mentioned had on the <hi>others.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as is the <hi>Converſion</hi> of this Sort of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſo are their <hi>after Experiences;</hi> the whole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing built upon Imagination, ſtrong Impreſſions and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Suggeſtions made to their Minds: whence they are uſually extreamly confident (as if immediately inform'd from God) not only of the Goodneſs of their own State, but of their infallible Knowledge and abſolute Certainty of the Truth of every Thing they pretend to, under the Notion of Religion: and thus all Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſome of them is utterly excluded.</p>
                     <p>But 'tis remarkable of theſe that they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely <hi>deficient</hi> in Regard of <hi>true Poverty of Spirit, Senſe of exceeding Vileneſs in themſelves,</hi> ſuch as frequently makes truly gracious Souls <hi>to groan being burden'd;</hi> as alſo in Regard of <hi>Meekneſs, Love</hi> and <hi>Gentleneſs toward Mankind, Tenderneſs of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in their ordinary Affairs and Dealings</hi> in the World; and 'tis rare to ſee them deeply concern'd about the <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Ends</hi> of their <hi>Actions,</hi> and under Fears leſt they ſhould not eye the <hi>Glory of God</hi> chiefly, but live to themſelves; or this at leaſt is the Caſe in their ordinary Conduct whether civil or religious. But if any one of their peculiar No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which their Zeal has eſpouſed be attack'd, they are then ſo conſciencious they muſt burn if call'd to it, for the Defence of it. Yet at the ſame Time when they are ſo extremely deficient in Regard of theſe precious
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:006067_0104_10275155536A8520"/>
Divine Tempers which have been mentioned, they are uſually full of Zeal, Concern and Fervency in the Things of Religion, and often Diſcourſe of them with much Warmth and Engagement. And to thoſe who don't know or don't conſider wherein the <hi>Eſſence of true Religion</hi> conſiſts, viz in being <hi>conformed to the Image of Chriſt,</hi> not in Point of <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Fervency only,</hi> but <hi>in all Divine Tempers and Practices;</hi> I ſay to thoſe who don't duely obſerve and diſtinguiſh, they often appear like the beſt of Men.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Now as all proper Means are to be uſed to cure the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of Men's Minds, eſpecially in Things of Religion, and as ſomething of this Nature may therefore ſeem pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly needful eſpecially in ſome Places; ſo 'tis hopeful that the Publication of the following ſmall Piece of the Rev. Mr. <hi>Shepard's</hi> will be made in ſome Meaſure ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable in that Reſpect. For as it is a <hi>Journal</hi> of the private Experiences of that excellent and holy Man, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for his own Uſe; ſo it contains as it were <hi>this true Religion</hi> for a Courſe of Time delineated to us in a very exact Manner: whence we have Opportunity to ſee with utmoſt Plainneſs, what paſs'd with him <hi>for Religion,</hi> what he laboured after under that Notion, and what were the Exerciſes and Difficulties he met with in purſuance of a religious Life. And thoſe who have any Savour for the Name and Piety of that venerable Man, 'tis hop'd will read his Experiences with Care and Attention; and as they read conſider whether there be any Manner of Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between <hi>his,</hi> and <hi>theirs.</hi> And whoever reads atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, I'm perſwaded muſt own that he finds a greater Appearance of <hi>true Humility, Self-Emptineſs, Self-Loathing; Senſe of great Unfruitfulneſs, Selfiſhneſs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Vileneſs of Heart, Smallneſs of Attainments in Grace:</hi> I ſay he muſt needs own that he finds more Expreſſions of deep unfeigned <hi>Self-Abaſement</hi> in theſe Experiences of Mr. <hi>Shepard's</hi> than ſome are willing to admit of. And 'tis hopeful the Reader will further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that when Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> ſpeaks of his <hi>Comforts</hi>
                     <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:006067_0105_1027510320536400"/>
in Religion as he frequently does of his Satisfaction and Sweetneſs and Deſires to die and to be with Chriſt; he always gives a ſolid Account of the <hi>Foundation</hi> of theſe Comforts, and mentions <hi>ſome Exerciſes of Grace</hi> from which they proceeded So that they are wholly different from thoſe groundleſs Joys that ariſe in the Minds of poor deluded Souls from a <hi>ſudden Suggeſtion</hi> made to them, that <hi>Chriſt is theirs,</hi> that <hi>God loves them,</hi> and the like.—The Reader will further obſerve that he va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued nothing in Religion that was not done with <hi>a View to the Glory of God;</hi> as appears by many of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, eſpecially that under <hi>April 15.</hi> where he ſays, <q>When I looked over the Day, I ſaw <hi>how I fell ſhort of God and Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>how I had Spent one Hour unprofitably:</hi> And why? becauſe though the Thing I did was good, yet becauſe <hi>I intended not God in it at my laſt End,</hi> and did not ſet my Rule before me and ſo ſet myſelf to pleaſe God; therefore I was unprofitable.</q> O that others from this Example would learn to lay the Streſs of Religion here, and labour that <hi>whether</hi> they <hi>live,</hi> they might <hi>live to the Lord;</hi> or <hi>whether</hi> they <hi>die</hi> they might <hi>die to the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is ſomething in theſe Papers of the Rev. Mr. <hi>Shepard's</hi> that ſeems excellently calculated to be of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to thoſe who are in the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> in Particular. His Method of examining his Aims and Ends and the Temper of his Mind, both before and after Preaching, whether he had met with Enlargement, or Straitning, is an excellent Example for others that bear the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Character. By this Means they are like to gain a large Acquaintance with their own Hearts, as 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent he had with his.</p>
                  <p>May the Bleſſing of Heaven attend the following Pages, that <hi>he</hi> who has long <hi>been dead may yet ſpeak</hi> by them to the Inſtruction, Conviction and ſaving Benefit of many Souls.</p>

                  <head>MEDITATIONS AND Spiritual Experiences OF Mr. THOMAS SHEPARD.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nov.</hi> 25. 1640. I Found <hi>my Heart and Mouth ſtraitned</hi> on the <hi>Lecture-Day,</hi> and for want of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement much troubled. Hence I eſſayed to humble my Soul before God, which the Lord helped me to do in this Manner:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſaw the Vanity of Honour, and therefore, why ſhould I be troubled for the Loſs of it by the Want of Enlargements?</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>(1) Becauſe it was but a Conceit in Men's Minds, of it ſelf.</item>
                     <item>(2) Becauſe it was naturally moſt dear, and ſo ſtood between me and Chriſt.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="2">2. I ſaw how fit it was, that the Will of Chriſt ſhould be done, as well in denying, as in giving En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largements; though he ſhould ſtrip me naked of them and all other Things.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When my Heart objected, can you be content that Chriſt ſhould loſe his Honour, and his Ordinance be blemiſhed by your Straitning? I then ſaw, I was
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:006067_0107_102751078942E920"/>
to be content to want them in Regard of my own Unworthineſs; and ſo,
<list>
                        <item>(1) To be vile in my own Eyes for my Sin, that moves the Lord to deny.</item>
                        <item>(2) To mourn that he ſhould not glorify himſelf by me.</item>
                        <item>(3) Then to pray him the more earneſtly to glorify himſelf by doing for me by his own Hand.</item>
                        <item>(4) I ſaw therefore that I ſhould leave my ſelf with the Lord for that End, with him who all <hi>had,</hi> and only <hi>did</hi> all.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nov.</hi> 29. In Prayer, I ſaw my Heart very vile, fill'd with Nothing but Evil; nay Mind and Mouth and Life, and all void of God. Hence I prayed to the Lord to poſſeſs me again (1) Becauſe he only was good, (2) Becauſe he only was worthy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1. A <hi>ſmall Thing troubled me.</hi> Hence I ſaw, that though the Lord had made me that Night attain to that Part of Humiliation, to ſee that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved nothing but Miſery; yet I fell ſhort in this other Part, viz. to ſubmit to God in any croſſing Providence or Command, but had a Spirit ſoon touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and provoked. I ſaw alſo, that the Lord let Sin, and Satan prevail there, that I might ſee my Sin, and be more humbled by it, and ſo get Strength againſt it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Decemb.</hi> 16. I ſaw myſelf <hi>very miſerable:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe by my Sin I had ſeparated my ſelf from God, and turned far from him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That he was turned in his Face from me.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>(1) I had no Senſe of his Majeſty, Power, Mercy, Being.</item>
                     <item>(2) No Senſe of his Love.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="3">3. I ſaw Sin had ſhut him from me, and my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, when he came to me, ſhut him out of me. Hence I ſaw a Need of a Mediator between us, and mourned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="unknown:006067_0108_1027515B00FF3FC0"/>
I had a Glimpſe of the Fulneſs of Grace in Chriſt in Meditation on <hi>John</hi> 1.14, like a Fountain over-flowing and above all my Conceiving to poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners which come to him. And hence my Heart began to be filled with lively Hope and Aſſurance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Decemb.</hi> 26. In reading the 12th of <hi>Hebrews,</hi> That <hi>Things ſhaken and made muſt be removed, that Things unmoveable may ſtand;</hi> I ſaw hence three Things:
<list>
                        <item>1. That only Chriſt and his Word ſhall remain and ſtand unſhaken.</item>
                        <item>2. That it's the ſweeteſt Thing to forſake all Creatures, and there to abide as the Stone on the Foundation.
<list>
                              <item>(1) Tis born up with it.</item>
                              <item>(2) It reſts there.</item>
                           </list>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. I ſaw how good it was to depart out of this World and to be with God, perfectly near Him, where no more ſhaking is, or ſhall be.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Decemb.</hi> 28. I <hi>deſiring to be led by the Truth,</hi> it was ſuggeſted, Follow it in your Practiſe, and prize it dearly, and I will go before you, and lead you into all Truth. But I ſaw how little I loved the Truths and Ways of God; either practical or ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Truth.</p>
                  <p>I ſaw this Morning, how <hi>all my Mercies came from Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <list>
                     <item>(1) He had plotted them,</item>
                     <item>(2) Purchaſed them,</item>
                     <item>(3) Promiſed them,</item>
                     <item>(4) Effected them.—And mine Heart was drawn near to the Lord with theſe Thoughts.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jan.</hi> 2. I ſaw (1) <hi>Chriſt was unmoveable</hi> (2) That they which truſt in Him are ſo. <hi>Pſal.</hi>

                     </gap>25. <hi>like Mount Sion</hi> (3) I ſaw that true Truſt was that which <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of Pſal. 39. <hi>And now, Lord, what Wait I for? my Hope is in thee.</hi> His Heart aſked him, Doſt thou hope for God? What do I,

ſaid he, hope for elſe? Hence I ſaw, (1) That true Hope hath other Affections of Deſire and Love mixed with it. (2) That he that hopes for nothing but God, and for all Things only from God, hopes truly.—But I found a Temptation and a Stop.—Did I hope for all Things from God and only God's Things? Do I hope and long to be out of the World to be perfectly free from all Sin, and fill'd with all Grace? Here I ſaw, this I could not do, 'till I did feel the infinite Vileneſs of Sin, and taſted a Happineſs in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and placed all my Happineſs there; which I felt a Want of. And hence I bewailed my Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before the Lord in this Reſpect, and purpoſed to make up the Breach herein, thorow his Grace; bleſſing God, I ſaw the worſt of my Heart, as well as the Good of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jan.</hi> 6. I ſaw I could have no Peace at Death, nor Hope that I ſhould go to Chriſt, unleſs I did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to <hi>do Chriſt's Work</hi> while I lived. Hereupon I conſidered, If I love him, my Soul will ſeek him: So I conſidered, that I muſt keep alive my Love to him in my Heart for this End. And why ſhould I love him? Becauſe none was good, or could do me Good, but he. My Self, Sins, Child, could do neither me nor themſelves any Good; but only he. Then I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, Shall I love him only becauſe he is only good to me?—I then reflected upon my ſelf, and ſaw my own Vileneſs and Selfiſhneſs; and how fit it was the Lord ſhould never regard me on that Account; yet I reſolved to ſeek him.</p>
                  <p>This Morning, in Meditation and Prayer; I was <hi>tempted</hi> to think, no Promiſe, no nor Command of God to ſeek the Lord and ſubmit to him, was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to me; but rather, that he had in Juſtice for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me, and ſo let me do what I pleaſe. But when I conſidered the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> how that they did but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that <hi>acting Will</hi> of a living God, revealing that

                     <hi>ſecret Will,</hi> which is ever ſo ſet as the Word reveals; my Soul was quieted, and I loved the Scriptures the more.</p>

                     <hi>Jan.</hi> 9. As I was walking in my Study, muſing on my Sermon in Q. 10. That God's <hi>Mercy</hi> was himſelf, as his <hi>Juſtice</hi> alſo was; the one to the Men that come to Chriſt; and to thoſe that are out of Chriſt, the other: Hence I conſidered, when I come to Chriſt there is no Wrath or Juſtice to devour, but ſweet Love: Wrath there is for refuſing him, not elſe. It was then objected, But it is to the Elect only. The Lord let me then ſee, I had nothing to do with that, but to look on his Truth, which is to them that come to him, that he would ſtand as a Rock between the ſcorching Sun and their Souls. Hence my Heart was ſweetly raviſhed, and began to long to die, and think of being with him. And my Heart ſaid, Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to comfort your ſelf thus, when you come to lie on your Sick Bed, to lie under this Rock, as in a hot Day. If one ſaw a Rock in a hot Day, ſhould he Say, That Rock will cool me if I be elected to it, and God has purpoſed it; ſo keep off in Fears? No, God has purpoſed thus to be a Rock to all that come to him, and are drawn by his Love.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jan.</hi> 11. In the Morning, the Lord preſented to me the <hi>ſad State of the Church;</hi> which put me upon a Spirit of Sorrow for my Sins, as one Cauſe, and to reſolve in Seaſon to go viſit all Families. But firſt to begin with my Self, and go to Chriſt, that he may begin to pour his Ointment on me; and then to my Wife, and then to my Family, and then to my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren &amp;c.</p>

                     <hi>Jan.</hi> 12. On <hi>Lecture-Day</hi> Morning I began to feel my Heart ſlight and vilify what I was to deliver. But the Lord put it into my Mind, that though the Truth is a poor, mean Thing in it ſelf, as every Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance alſo is; yet very glorious, as it is appointed and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006067_0111_1027510E8D680990"/>
ſeparated of God for his own Ends. Hence I came to ſee the Glory of God's Ordinances, where it did lie; and that was, not in themſelves, but in God's ſanctifying them for moſt ſweet Ends to communicate his Preſence and his lovely Pleaſantneſs, and this Love operating with Power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jan.</hi> 19. I ſaw <hi>my looſe Walking without God:</hi> and ſo was put to a Stand, what to ſay of my ſelf. I ſaw that Hypocrites are far from humbling, becauſe far from Conviction: they hope ſomething there is in them. But I brought my Heart to conſider thus, If my State is good, then there is Cauſe of deeper Mourning for abuſing the Lord, ſo good; or my State is not good, and then there is Cauſe of Breaking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am ſo wretched ſtill; and ſo I went to Prayer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jan.</hi> 21. I ſaw <hi>God's Wrath</hi> kindled againſt <hi>Sin;</hi> and hence I ſaw, and mourned for, the Evil of Sin, ſo bitter to Him.</p>
                  <p>I was on the 26th of <hi>January much affected with the Lord's Goodneſs, and brought near to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt I found many Lets ſtanding between me and the Lord in Prayer; as the Hiding of his Face, my own Heart turned from him. But then I ſaw Chriſt, and his Command to come Hand in Hand with him to the Father. So that metho't I was with God and in his Preſence. And then this Truth came in, That if ever I got Good from the Lord in any Ordinance, I muſt firſt come into the Preſence of God, and ſet him before me, as <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his Company did, and as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.—And when I was here, methought it was ſo ſweet to pray and make my Moan to the Lord, as a God that could and was willing to pity. And ſo I was ſo knit to God that I intended never to depart from him again. (1) I ſaw God was my Reſt; and hence, why ſhould I depart from him to any other Thing, in Regard of his Goodneſs? (2) I ſaw the Riches of his Mercy: Hence I came to get
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006067_0112_10275160D9D1C978"/>
my Conſcience at Reſt, and to believe he would hear me, and be with me. (3.) I ſaw his Glory: and hence ſaw my whole Life ſhould Reſt there, in acting for, and honouring of him, who alone was worthy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jan.</hi> 28. I conſidered, being in his Preſence, <hi>what I did want?</hi> And it came in thus: (1) I did want <hi>Light,</hi> even ſo much as to make me believe ſtedfaſtly. (2) So much <hi>Faith</hi> as to make me cleave to God conſtantly. (3) For Want of this I departed from God. (4) By departing, all Woe came a main upon me; both Sin and Miſery. And ſo I underſtood, better than before, how Unbelief was the Cauſe of all Woe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jan.</hi> 30. When I was in Meditation, I ſaw, <hi>When Chriſt was preſent, all Bleſſings were preſent;</hi> as where any were without Chriſt preſent, there all Sorrows were. Hence I ſaw how little of Chriſt was preſent in me. I ſaw I did not ceaſe to be and live of my ſelf, that Chriſt might be and live in me. I ſaw that Chriſt was to do, counſel, direct, and that I ſhould be wholly diffident of my ſelf, and careful for this that he might be all to me. Hence I bleſſed Chriſt for ſhewing me this, and mourned for the Want of it.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame Time <hi>I ſaw his Will,</hi> and <hi>how it was my Sin ſo to pray, as to think to bring God's Will to mine,</hi> with a ſecret Murmuring, or thinking, 'Tis in vain to ſeek, if the Lord do not ſo. For what is this but Pride, and to command Chriſt, and to be above him, as if I were wiſer than he? But I ſaw the Work of Prayer was, to bring my Will to his. And this gave me much Light, and ſet my Heart in a ſweet Frame. And hence I underſtood that Place, <hi>Whatſoever we aſk according to his Will, he heareth us.</hi> And this, not only when we pray according to his Will of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and Promiſe, but when we have done, to bring our Wills to his ſweet Sovereign Will, let him do with me what he pleaſe; which is his Will of Sovereignty.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006067_0113_10275112BAD72BE0"/>
Now in the Time of Prayer, I conſidered, Why the Lord ſhould command me to aſk Pardon, Peace, Brokenneſs of Heart &amp;c? And I conſidered, that it muſt needs be that he, might give me the thing pormiſed: (1) Becauſe his commanding Will is ever attended with a Promiſe. (2) Becauſe it was for his Glory, as well as my Good, that I ſhould aſk. And hence he would give certainly, when I did aſk, eſpecially being ſet on by his Command. Hence my Heart was much moved and melted, to conſider of my Unbelief paſt, and how much I had diſhonoured Chriſt, thus to think of him, and to maintain hard Thoughts of him, that he will not hear. And ſo began, that <hi>Day of Faſt,</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>February</hi> 1. When I was on my Bed a <hi>Monday Morning,</hi> the Lord let me ſee, <hi>I was nothing elſe but a Maſs of Sin, and that all I did was very vile.</hi>—Which when my Heart was ſomewhat touched with, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately the Lord revealed himſelf to me in <hi>his Fulneſs of Goodneſs</hi> with much ſweet Affection. The Lord ſuddenly appeared, and let me ſee, there was Strength in him to ſuccour me, Wiſdom to guide, Mercy in him to quicken, Chriſt to ſatisfie: And ſo I ſaw all my Good was there, as all Evil was in my ſelf. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I began to entertain Thoughts of the Glory of this Mercy, if the Lord would become mine; ſo that I ſhould be ſtrong with God's Strength, and live by God's Life, and be guided by God's Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom &amp;c. And ſhould become his, for him to take Care for me and love me, and I to pitch my Thought and Heart on him. I conſidered, this would be an Exchange of wonderful Love, for me to have God and not my ſelf, and God to have me and give me himſelf.—</p>
                  <p>I aroſe with theſe Thoughts, and had ſome Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to conſider more of them. And on <hi>Monday Night,</hi> the ſame Day in Prayer and Meditation,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:006067_0114_1027516263550B40"/>
theſe Thoughts came in from the Experience which I found then; viz.
<list>
                        <item>(1) I ſaw <hi>all Fulneſs in God of all the Good I did need;</hi> and ſo all my Good, or what might be good for me, there: And ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, that the firſt Thing the Lord reveals to draw the Soul to himſelf, is the Fulneſs of Grace in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</item>
                        <item>(2) Being doubting, Is this mine or no? I then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that the Lord did invite me to come to him, becauſe I ſaw that his Word did not bid me depart from him. And methought, in conſidering this, the Lord's Word, Come poor Creature, was ſo ſweet, that I came to him.</item>
                        <item>(3) Being thus come I conſidered, I muſt cleave to him, and be knit to him. And then the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of this, that all my Good, All was in him, made me ſo to do, in ſome Meaſure, with dear Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</item>
                        <item>(4) Cleaving thus to him, I conſidered, whether he was become mine now, and I his? And here I ſtuck a while, being loth to fancy ſuch a Thing, and becauſe he did not cleave to me, as I could feel. But the <hi>Night after,</hi> God returned <hi>this Anſwer.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) That he had applied himſelf to me, becauſe he had drawn me to himſelf, who elſe could never have come. And hence, if he pitied me when far from, much more being now near to him. (2) Becauſe of the Riches and Fulneſs of his tender Grace, being come he would let it out. (3) Becauſe of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Him that cometh I will in no wiſe caſt out;</hi> and <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.4, 5.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Feb.</hi> 9. I conſidered, <hi>When I could not bring Chriſt's Will to mine, I was to bring mine to his.</hi> But then it muſt be thus. (1) That if ever he gives my Deſire it will be infinite Mercy, and ſo his Will is good. (2) If he doth not, yet that I deſerved to be croſs'd, and to feel nothing but Extremity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="unknown:006067_0115_10275115D2C76368"/>
                     <hi>Feb.</hi> 14. When there was a <hi>Church Meeting</hi> to be reſolved <hi>about our Going away</hi> [viz. to <hi>Matabeſeck.</hi>] I looked on my ſelf as poor, and as unable to reſolve my Self, or to guide others, or my Self in any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as a Beaſt: And I ſaw my ſelf, in Reſpect of Chriſt, as bruitiſh, as a Brute is in Reſpect of Man: And hence, (1) I left my ſelf on Chriſt's Wiſdom. (2) I underſtood the Meaning of <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. That, tho' <hi>Agur</hi> knew he had Wiſdom, yet in Reſpect of Chriſt he was <hi>brutiſh;</hi> and alſo in Reſpect of Man. As it is ſaid, <hi>There is none Good but God;</hi> and when <hi>God</hi> is called <hi>only wiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Feb.</hi> 15. I was in Prayer, and in the Beginning of it, that Promiſe came in, <hi>Seek me and you ſhall live, Hag.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon I ſaw, I had Cauſe to ſeek him only, alway; becauſe there was nothing elſe good, and becauſe he was alway good. And my Heart made choice of GOD alone, and he was a ſweet Portion to me. And I began to ſee how well I could be without all other Things with him; and ſo learnt to live by Faith. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it came in, Why did I not deſire to live with him alone in Heaven? And I ſaw my Heart very apt to comfort it ſelf in other Things beſides him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Feb.</hi> 16. I ſaw my Heart was <hi>not prepared to die, becauſe I had not ſtudied to wean my Heart from the World;</hi> but I ſaw, and ſought (1) The Glory of it. (2) The Reſt and Peace of it. (3) The Joy of it. When the Truth is, I ſhould (1) ſee a greater Glory and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Father in Heaven and be weaned from that. (2) I ſhould ſeek Reſt there only. (3) I ſhould joy with that Joy only. O Lord, help me ſo to do, and to pray for it, and ſtudy it daily! For what is the Glory, Peace, Reſt, Joy of the World, a Creature, a periſhing Thing to that of a God?</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>Feb.</hi> 23. On Bed I conſider'd, how ſweetly the Lord was ſometimes with me, and ſo how I ſhould preſerve that Spirit and go forward: But I ſaw that any little Buſineſs, a little Forgetfulneſs ſet Chriſt's Work backward again; Which was ſad to me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Feb.</hi> 23. At <hi>Night,</hi> after <hi>Lecture,</hi> I ſaw <hi>my Vileneſs,</hi> and ſaw, I was <hi>not to ſeek my ſelf in Prayer.</hi> And hence the Lord made me ſee nothing but Shame to belong to me. And hence praying for the Church, I aſked my Soul, whether thoſe Prayers could be heard? And I found an Anſwer, <hi>The Lord will hear the Prayer of the humble, will not deſpiſe their Cry.</hi> Which did ſweetly chear my Heart, to ſee my Soul built on ſuch Promiſes as <hi>David</hi> did uſually comfort himſelf withal: For <hi>I Cry,</hi> For <hi>I truſt in thee,</hi> For <hi>I am deſtitute, He will hear the Cry of the Humble.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Feb.</hi> 24. I ſaw <hi>how apt I was to think myſelf ſomething.</hi> And the Lord put me on humbling Work, to ſee I was Worſe than nothing, and to ſeek no other Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement or Honour, but Mercy, if I might find that; which I thought was a great, yet holy Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>March</hi> 2. I was caſt down with the <hi>Sight of our Unworthineſs</hi> in this Church, deſerving to be utterly waſted. But the Lord filled my Heart with a Spirit of Prayer, not only to deſire ſmall Things, but with an holy Boldneſs to deſire great Things for God's People here, and for my ſelf; viz. That I might live to ſee all Breaches made up, and the Glory of the Lord upon us; and that I might not die, but live to ſhew forth God's Glory to this and the Children of the next Generation. And ſo I aroſe from Prayer with ſome Confidence of an Anſwer. (1) Becauſe I ſaw Chriſt put it into my Heart to aſk.—(2) Becauſe he was true to hear all Prayer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>March</hi> 13. I purpoſed to walk daily more cloſely with God, according to the Rule.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="unknown:006067_0117_10275118F65AA470"/>
                     <hi>March</hi> 15. The Lord let in much Light. Many ſweet Truths I wrote down. He made me alſo caſt the Church on Chriſt's Care and Love, as being his Charge. I reſolved to hang faſt about Chriſt, and to love him dearly, becauſe of his Goodneſs, as knowing none like him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>March</hi> 17. I began to queſtion, <hi>whether Chriſtians generally were ſo good as they ſeem'd to be?</hi> I thought, [1] They were not ſo good as the Lord would have them to be, from two Arguments. (1) From the Want of Aſſurance generally among Men. Which argues God is angry, when he doth not appear ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he doth uſe to do to them who love his Name. (2) Becauſe Men are better generally under the Rod, than under Mercy. We ſee what an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Spirit there is under ſore Afflictions, which Men cannot attain to, or keep, but then. Now [2dly] I thought that Men were not ſo good as they appeared to be, (1) Becauſe very few are recovered to that Frame before Death, which God will bring them to, that get Aſſurance. Few recover Holineſs by Mercy, or feel the eternal Good of ſore Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. (2) Becauſe many eminent Profeſſors fall off and fall away. If they continue long, by ſome Trial or other they are made tranſparent. (3) Becauſe, though others of leſs Holineſs may be upright; yet for us that have more Means, not to be more holy and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nay not ſo humble and holy as thoſe that want Means, cannot ſtand with Uprightneſs, generally. My Counſel therefore is, <hi>Let all take Heed</hi> of being led by Example of Men, and thinking, We are good becauſe we are like them that be ſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>March</hi> 18. I ſaw, if <hi>my Mind</hi> acted, it ſpun no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Deceit and Deluſion.</hi> If my <hi>Will and Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> acted, there was nothing but <hi>dead Works.</hi> Oh! how do I need Chriſt to live in me? Yet I ſaw, If a Man hath Eyes and Light, he will not lean to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006067_0118_1027516AC6230F68"/>
to lead him and carry him, as when he wants both. So here, I ſaw the Lord made me live by <hi>Faith,</hi> by making me feel a <hi>Want</hi> of both, to diſtruſt myſelf and truſt more unto the Lord.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>March</hi> 19. <hi>After a Day of Faſt.</hi> As I ſaw in the Day, that I had <hi>Cauſe to weep exceedingly for my Sin,</hi> becauſe it did lie ſo heavy, not only on the Father, but upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that they were ſo wroth with me, that they hid their Faces: and hence I ſaw that Sin lay heavy on their Hearts, and that therefore they were not only angry, but left me to my Sin, which cauſed ſome Sorrow. So after the Day, I ſaw and ſaid, As <hi>Pride</hi> was <hi>my Sin,</hi> ſo <hi>Shame</hi> ſhould be <hi>my Portion.</hi> And many Fears I had of <hi>Eli</hi>'s Puniſhment for not reproving Sin in Mr. <hi>E.</hi> when I ſaw it, and that ſharply.—And here I ſaw that God may, and doth ſometimes, make ſome one godly Man a Terror and dreadful Example of outward Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; that all others may fear that be godly, leſt his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands ſhould be ſlighted, as he did by <hi>Eli.</hi> And ſo I ſaw, the Lord might juſtly never let my Sins be purged away by Sacrifice.—</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>March</hi> 20. My Heart was much affected with the <hi>Riches of God's Mercy,</hi> in reading <hi>Jer.</hi> 36.3. That the very Threatning of God to deſtroy, is to make Men return and pray, and ſo live: Which is deep and dear Mercy. And that the Lord deals thus with ſuch as are almoſt hopeleſs. Yet if there be any Hope, the Lord pitieth; It may be they will return. Which made me, that Morning, in Prayer to pour out my Heart in true and plain Confeſſion of my Vileneſs, which I knew, with Groans for Grace.</p>
                  <p>1641. <hi>April</hi> 2d and 3d. I was earneſt in Prayer for God's Favour and Love, and doubting of it for my ſelf and others, becauſe I looked to God's ſecret Decree; at laſt I ſaw it was God's Decree in the Goſpel, and his Will, that whoſoever comes to Chriſt
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006067_0119_1027511BD2B33370"/>
ſhould have Life and Favour, and ſo Anſwer to all Prayers for himſelf and others; which gave me ſome ſweet Aſſurance!</p>
                  <p>After this, I ſaw the Lord might deny all our Prayers for outward Things. I begg'd therefore for Mercy: And that being granted, I had an End of all my Suits and Requeſts for myſelf and others: And there my Heart ſtayed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>April</hi> 4. and 5. On <hi>Sabbath-Morning (April 4) I ſaw the Lord frowning on me in ſeveral Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That he was hid from me, whoſe Face elſe would ſhine brighter on me, than ten Thouſand Suns.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That he was angry with my Prayers, and had been, and is ſtill, angry.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nothing I did, nay none under my Shadow proſpered.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I ſaw I wanted Wiſdom for my Place, to guide others.</p>

                  <p n="6">6. I ſaw I wanted the Power of the Holy Ghoſt, and that I was not mighty in Word and Spirit and in Adminiſtrations.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. I ſaw a ſecret Eye I had to my Name in all I did; for which I judged my ſelf worthy of Death, but I did not grow weaned from all created Glory, from Honour, Wiſdom, Eſteem of others &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>April</hi> 5. I ſaw I did not remember the Sins of my Youth; nay the Sins of one Day I forgot the next Day; and ſo I ſpent my Time.</p>
                  <p>I was on my Bed praying this Morning, and the Lord helped me to pour out my Heart before him. And I ſaw, <hi>I could plead nothing in my ſelf in regard of any Worthineſs and Grace, or any Thing in Regard of God's Providence, or Promiſe; but only his good
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006067_0120_1027516D9FEB47A8"/>
Pleaſure.</hi> I ſaw it was not, if I will, but if he will, then I ſhould ſee and believe and live. And here I hung, pleading, how good, how pitiful and tender, how free this Will was. I ſaw it ſtood immoveable, till it moved it ſelf toward me. I ſaw God's Will was, that I ſhould come; but I was afraid of mine own Activity and Working; and hence pleaded, Lord turn me, draw me, and I ſhall come!—And ſo I beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for my Wife, Child, Friends, Church, with Earneſtneſs, that the Lord would give us but <hi>Mercy,</hi> and not ſuffer his Name to be polluted by us and by our Debts, though he ſhould not honour himſelf by us! And if <hi>Mercy</hi> would make us poor and vile, bleſſed be it.—And if it would lead us and carry us to ſome other Place, and cover and over-ſhadow us, bleſſed be it. And I had ſecret Hints, that theſe Prayers from our Wants were but Preparations for future Mercies; and that we ſhould ſee his Glory in the Land of the Living.— Then I began to ariſe after Prayer, without Faith as I thought, yet leaving all to his Grace. But the Lord ſhewed me, how he had come to me and ſtirred up Prayers, (1) according to his own Will; (2) For his own Ends. For though I ſought my ſelf, yet ſeeing this, I entreated the Lord to glorify himſelf, and make us like unto his. And then I ſaw, how great a Sin it was to make <hi>Feeling</hi> a Ground and cauſe of my <hi>Faith.</hi> And I alſo tho't, how exceedingly I ſhould honour Jeſus Chriſt, if I did <hi>believe,</hi> before I <hi>felt;</hi> How I ſhould honour the Truth of Chriſt who hath ſaid, he is one <hi>that hears Prayers.</hi>—I ſaw alſo a ſecret Diſtemper of my Heart, how I grew faint in Prayer, contrary to the Rule, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. viz. not only by Diſcouragement but alſo by Encouragement, and Enlargement and Affections in Prayer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>April</hi> 10. I had many Thoughts which came in to preſs me <hi>to give my ſelf to Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> which was
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:006067_0121_1027511D5B003370"/>
the dear beſt Thing I had. And I ſaw, If when I gave my ſelf to Chriſt, He would give himſelf to me again, that it would be a wonderful Change: to have the bottomleſs Fountain of all Good communicated to me. Thus two or three Days I was exerciſed about this. And at laſt, (which was the Day before I fell ſick on the <hi>Sabbath</hi>) in my Study, I was put to a double <hi>Queſtion.</hi> (1) Whether Chriſt would take me, if I gave my ſelf to him? (2) Whether I might take him again upon it? And I reſolved to ſeek an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to both from God, in Meditation. So after Dinner on the <hi>Saturday,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>April</hi> 11. <hi>I gave my ſelf up to the Lord thus;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. I acknowledged, all I had or was, was his own; (as <hi>David</hi> ſpake of their Offerings) and ſo I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged him the Owner.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I reſigned not only my Goods and Eſtate, but Child, Wife, Church and Self unto the Lord, out of Love, as being the beſt and deareſt Things which I have.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I prized it as the greateſt Mercy, if the Lord would take them, and ſo deſired the Lord to do it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I deſired him to take all for a threefold End, (1) To do with me what he would, (2) To love me, (3) To honour himſelf by me and by all mine.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Becauſe there is apt to be a ſecret Reſervation in our ſeeming Deſires, That the Lord ſhould do all; and the Soul gives up it ſelf to the Lord, but 'tis that the Lord may pleaſe my Will, and love me; and if he doth not pleaſe me, then the Heart dies: Hence I gave up <hi>my Will</hi> alſo into the Lord's Hand, to do with it what he pleaſe.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. I gave up alſo my whoriſh Luſts; but that he might take them away.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That he would keep me alſo from all Sin and Evil.</p>
                  <p>Thus I gave my ſelf to the Lord; but then I queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned (2) <hi>Will the Lord take me?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="unknown:006067_0122_1027517202AA0990"/>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I ſaw that the Lord deſired and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to give him my Heart.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I ſaw that this was pleaſing to him, as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary diſpleaſing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I ſaw that it was fit for him to take me and do what he would with me.</p>
                  <p>But then I did queſtion, <hi>Will the Lord receive me, and take me to do me good everlaſtingly?</hi> Becauſe I gave up my Friends, and the whole Church to the Lord alſo, as I did my ſelf: <hi>And will the Lord take all them?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here I ſaw the great Priviledge of Men and Wiſdom of God in his committing ſome Men's Souls to the Care of one godly Man, of a publick Spirit; becauſe he, <hi>Moſes</hi>-like, commends them, gives them, returns them all to the Lord again, and ſo a World of Good is communicated for his Sake.</p>
                  <p n="3">3d. Queſtion was; <hi>But might I take the Lord?</hi> And my</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer</hi> was, If the Lord did apprehend and take me to himſelf, then I might take him, for I had no other to lay hold on.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>April</hi> 13. I queſtioned, whether the Lord could Pardon ſome Sins, or would? And I was made to caſt my Eye upon the Goſpel. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>Whom God hath ſet out, to be a Propitiation, through Faith in his Blood.</hi> This <hi>Faith</hi> I ſaw to be nothing elſe, but <hi>Receiving God's Kindneſs, and ſpecial Favour with my whole Heart;</hi> and ſo was quite oppoſite to <hi>Doing.</hi> And herein, methought, the exceeding Riches of God's Grace appeared, That he ſhould now, after all Wrongs done againſt him, offer ſpecial Love, and require me only to take it, and Poſſeſſion of it: And ſo I felt my Heart receive it with my whole Spirit, with all my Heart. Only I queſtioned, <hi>Will the Lord receive me with his Hand again, when I receive it?</hi> And I ſaw, that the Lord had bound himſelf by Promiſe ſo to do, and I prayed that he would do ſo to me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="unknown:006067_0123_1027511EE83AA908"/>
                     <hi>April</hi> 14. When I was at Prayer (having on my Bed that Morning ſeen <hi>how ſweet a Thing it was to be ever near the Lord,</hi> and thereby filled with holy, ſweet Affections unto God) I ſaw and I ſorrowed a little for <hi>my Sins and vile Nature,</hi> which was ever carrying and haling me from God, the Fountain of all Goodneſs and Love; the Bleſſedneſs of which, when any ſee, they cannot but mourn for their Sin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>April.</hi> 15. When I looked over the Day I ſaw <hi>how I fell ſhort of God and Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>how I had ſpent one Hour unprofitably.</hi> And why? Becauſe, though the Thing I did was good, yet becauſe <hi>I intended not God in it, as my laſt End,</hi> and did not ſet my Rule before me, and ſo ſet my ſelf to pleaſe God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was unprofitable: And ſo I deſired to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for it. And ſo I ſaw the Nature of <hi>Fruitfulneſs,</hi> that it conſiſted in acting for God with Singleneſs of Heart.</p>
                  <p>I obſerved my Heart in walking according to Rule; but I ſaw it fall off. And this I learned, that when a Man ſets himſelf to walk by Rule, he will either ſay I cannot, or elſe will not, but hates the ſame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>April</hi> 16. I ſaw my <hi>Example</hi> did (1) Teach, (2) encourage, (3) counſel, (4) confirm others in Sin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>April</hi> 18. On <hi>Sabbath,</hi> I <hi>found my Heart full of Enmity,</hi> and I ſaw it was Satan that fill'd it; when I ſhould with Fear have heard what God ſpake, and with Care received the Word, and kept it in my Heart, by which Chriſt himſelf comes in; as I ſaw by Temptation Satan entred into wicked Men's Hearts: But the Lord humbled my Soul in ſome Meaſure, and made me deſire Pardon and Healing of Satan's Wound by his Mercy in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>April</hi> 25. I ſaw God would accept me for Chriſt's Sake; but I feared much, I might not take Chriſt aright. Hence this came to my Mind, That <hi>to take Chriſt becauſe he commands me ſo to do, is no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="unknown:006067_0124_1027517676B1BD50"/>
(1) Becauſe this honours him. (2) Becauſe he that will ſubmit to one Command thus, will ſubmit to all. (3) Becauſe I ſaw, that he that let's in Chriſt's Command into his Heart, receives Chriſt; and he that receives one Command thus, receives all Chriſt, and all the Commands of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>April.</hi> 25. While I was at the Word, I ſaw <hi>I had a wild Heart,</hi> which was as hard to ſtand and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide before the Preſence of God in an Ordinance, as a Bird before any Man—I ſaw alſo, Chriſt will do what he will, if we do but will. The Church begs all, and Chriſt doth all; becauſe ſhe is poor and he is rich; She is weak, and he is ſtrong.—Prayer ſets Chriſt on upon his Churches Adverſaries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>April</hi> 28. I <hi>finding my Heart reſt on Chriſt</hi> and peaceably quieted there; hence, when I ſaw the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward good Things which others did enjoy, I was ſweetly comforted with this, <q>yet I have Chriſt, and Chriſt is mine, others have other Things.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>April</hi> 29. I ſaw this Diſtemper (when I ſaw <hi>my ſudden Anger</hi>) viz. That I was troubled at that which croſſed <hi>me,</hi> not <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and pleaſed only with that which pleaſed <hi>my ſelf,</hi> and not <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> For [1] in all Wrongs and Croſſes there is a double Croſs. (1) That which croſſeth <hi>me,</hi> (2) That which croſſeth <hi>Chriſt:</hi> [2] In all good Things there is 1. Somewhat that pleaſeth <hi>me.</hi> 2. Somewhat that pleaſeth <hi>Chriſt.</hi> My Heart is pleaſed or troubled as Things pleaſe or trouble <hi>me</hi> without my having any due Regard to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and that is my Sin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>April</hi> 30. I queſtioned, <hi>whether any Sin was a greater Evil than Unbelief?</hi> And I ſaw that <hi>Union to Chriſt</hi> was <hi>my greateſt Good:</hi> Hence Unbelief is a greater Sin than any other Sin. And here I ſaw God's rich Grace that had not only made <hi>my Diſunion from Chriſt</hi> by Unbelief a Miſery, but alſo the greateſt Sin, as being croſs to his Command: And hereby
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:006067_0125_1027512783B7FEF0"/>
my Heart was affected. And I ſaw that whatever my Sin was, yet now there was no Sin like Diſunion from Chriſt by Unbelief; and that I ought not to commit the greateſt Sin in departing from Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of leſs Sins againſt the Law. For it was an <hi>unſpeakable Mercy</hi> to make <hi>my Union to Chriſt the greateſt Good, my greateſt Good.</hi> 1. Becauſe I can never in this Life perfectly obey and cleave to the Will of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe if that be Bleſſedneſs, then once bleſſed, always bleſſed: So once united ever united. So I ſaw the Goſpel, in commanding me <hi>to believe,</hi> did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me to partake of the greateſt Bleſſedneſs; and who would not be glad of that? <hi>Adam</hi>'s Happineſs was, to <hi>do God's Will;</hi> but <hi>ours</hi> to <hi>cleave to God in Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>May</hi> 5. I ſaw <hi>I was without all Senſe, as well as Sight of God, eſtranged from the Life of God:</hi> For I ſaw I reſpected <hi>Man</hi> more than <hi>God,</hi> to pleaſe him rather than God. And why ſo? Becauſe I was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the Preſence of Man. So if I had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any Sin againſt Man, I ſhould be aſhamed; but I bluſh not before God. I was not ſenſible of his Glory, Majeſty, Beauty and Love. And hence I had no Senſe of Sin, becauſe I had no Senſe of God. —And hence with Sadneſs I ſaw my Widow-like Separation and Diſunion from my Huſband and my God, and that we two were now parted, who had been nearer together once. And I ſaw, (though not deeply) what my Iniquities are, to preferr the Creature above the Creator bleſſed for ever? And as the Life is, the Senſe is.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>May</hi> 6. <hi>The Lord Jeſus</hi> revealed himſelf thus to me viz. That as he was <hi>Mercy and Love to all meek, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled believing Sinners that came to him;</hi> ſo he was <hi>Fire and Wrath againſt all obſtinate Sinners, that would not bow to him: but go on in their Sin.</hi> And ſo I ſatisfied that Doubt; when my Heart ſaid, Why ſhall I be
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:006067_0126_1027517953AFBBE0"/>
troubled for Sin, ſeeing God in Chriſt takes it not much to Heart, but forgives, bears, pardons and he was all Love and no Wrath in him? I replied again, He is ſo to all meek ones, that ſtop, ſtoop and yield: But he takes the leaſt Sin exceedingly to Heart and very ill, when Men will go on in it. My Heart was much comforted with the Knowledge of this, and wrought to ſome more Fear and Love to him, and reſolved to give up my ſelf to Him.—I ſaw alſo <hi>the Greatneſs of Sin,</hi> to ſtrike him by it, who is the Glory, of Heaven and Earth, and who takes it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ill at my Hands, if I do, or eſpecially per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in it. The Lord alſo preſs'd my Spirit to pleaſe Chriſt in <hi>every</hi> Thing; not in ſome Things only, but to be <hi>ever</hi> pleaſing him—I ſaw alſo, that I was not in good earneſt deſirous that Chriſt would take away Sin by the Loſs of Name or Goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>May</hi> 7. I ſaw in Prayer, that <hi>before I,</hi> or any other <hi>could ſeek or ſerve the Lord, I was to ſet up the Lord in the Throne of my Mind and Heart,</hi> both in his <hi>Greatneſs,</hi> and in his <hi>Goodneſs</hi> to me. And the Lord gave me ſome Glimpſe of both that Morning; yet I ſaw that all was little enough to make me ſeek him and ſerve him. For I ſaw my Heart averſe from his Will, and that the Lord muſt be exceeding great and dear in my Heart, or elſe it would never ſeek and ſerve him. And ſo I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, If it be ſo hard to ſeek the Lord when he is ſet up, how difficult to ſeek or ſerve him when he is caſt down? Surely if there be any Services or Seekings without ſetting up the Lord, they are Hypocriſies.</p>
                  <p>I ſaw alſo, <hi>how great my Sin would be, not to be acquainted and grow familiar with the Lord;</hi> when he hath humbled himſelf into my Fleſh for that End, and to make a near Conjunction between himſelf and me. For we are joined to Man, who is Fleſh of our Fleſh, ſooner, than with an Angel, or with God.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:006067_0127_102751290C0F0558"/>
When the Devil comes to make a Covenant, he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes the Shape of a Man. And here I ſaw that our Union is firſt to the humane Nature, and ſo to the Divine: Becauſe the Divine Nature comes down into the humane, that it may be a Mean of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the Soul to God, and of God to the Soul.—And I ſaw, that as we are ſooner conjoined to Man; ſo God in Man is ſooner conjoined, or he more eaſily conjoins himſelf to us, who is filled with real humane Bowels for that End, and hath ſuffered that no Juſtice might ſtop him in his Work.—</p>
                  <p>I conſidered, that <hi>when Prayer is vehement for a Bleſſing,</hi> and <hi>our Humiliation and Breaking, from Sin is ſuitable to our Affection, God ever anſwers them.</hi> Hence, let Men obſerve, if they are earneſt for any outward Bleſſing, and their Hearts are ſtirred up ſo as to believe they ſhall have it, let them ſee if their <hi>Humiliation</hi> was proportionable. Hence alſo 'tis, that when the Lord denies us, 'tis ever to humble us, which is Mercy; and we ſhall ſee that we have moſt need of that. And hence alſo when humbled, we may reap the Fruit of Prayers made many Years before.</p>
                  <p>On <hi>Saturday</hi> [May 8] at Night <hi>I ſaw Union to God to be the greateſt Good; and my Sin in not cleaving wholly to him with all my Heart, the Height of all Sin,</hi> from <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10.1. Hence in Prayer I ſaw Sin my greateſt Evil. 1. Becauſe it had ſeparated me from the greateſt Good. 2. Becauſe it kept my Heart with a ſecret Love to it from returning again to him, as my greateſt Good.—3. Nay I ſaw that it made me make my Death my Life; viz Neglect of living and acting for God my very Life; and my War with GOD, my Peace; and my Damnation my Salvation: Hence I mourned.—</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>May</hi> 12. <hi>When I was ſtirred up to give Thanks for Mercys,</hi> I was put to a ſtand, <hi>Why not for Evils as well?</hi> Seeing both were from God's Will. And the Lord
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:006067_0128_1027517ADD47E150"/>
put it into my Heart to ſee that it is becauſe God's chiefeſt, deareſt Attribute is honoured more that Way. And ſo I ſaw I was not to be thankful becauſe the Bleſſing ſuited me, but becauſe God's deareſt and moſt beloved Attribute of Grace and Mercy was glorified hereby—</p>
                  <p>I ſaw alſo, <hi>how one Sin begat another</hi> in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and we did not ceaſe to increaſe therein. And hence I ſaw, what juſt Cauſe the Lord had to ſtrike us with ſore and great Wants, and yet how, if Sin were repented of by preaching againſt it, the Lord would return. So I ſaw it my Duty to preach againſt them.—</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>May</hi> 18. In Prayer I was aſhamed that I ſhould not ſerve the Lord, as I had done my Luſt and my Sin.</p>
                  <p>I ſaw alſo that <hi>God was beforehand with Men.</hi> (1) In that he had reconciled the World to himſelf. (2) That he did beſeech them to be reconciled. Now I ſaw that all the Work did lie upon Man. For if the Party offended firſt ſeek to be Friends, I need not call in Queſtion his Willingneſs, but my own wicked Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſneſs. Here I ſaw, that if it be ſo with Man, and he do not come in to him that ſeeks for Favour, 'tis either (1) from Contempt; or (2) Anger, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling at his Dealing; or (3) Malice, yet the Lord wraps up all in one Word, <hi>Enmity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>May</hi> 21. In Prayer I deſired two Things (1) That God only might be ſweet, (2) That his Will might be mine. At which Time it came into my Heart, If you ſincerely deſire <hi>theſe two,</hi> you will deſire to be in Heaven, where theſe two are fully perfected. For I ſaw though Death was naturally terrible, yet I ſecretly rejoiced to think of that infinite Mercy, when God alone ſhall fill my Soul with his immediate Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteneſs.</p>
                  <p>On the <hi>Sabbath, May</hi> 23. I came to a ſerious
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:006067_0129_1027512A96BA9E68"/>
Conſideration, <hi>what Sins were between God, and me, that eclipſed his Love?</hi> and I ſaw my Evils, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved with more Care to walk with him, and to be humbled for Evils paſt. And found my Heart in looking on thoſe Duties I was to do, to be afraid, leſt I ſhould fail in the Performance of them. And ſo I ſaw, if I laid the Evidence of my Salvation on my Works, it would be various and uncertain as my gracious Works were: And yet on the other Side; I ſaw that if I did not walk holily in all Things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, I ſhould not,—I could not have Aſſurance of my good Eſtate. So that here I was at ſome Stand. And in Muſing, thus the <hi>twenty-fifth Pſalm</hi> came to Mind, wherein God promiſeth <hi>the meek and humble to ſhew them his Covenant.</hi> And ſo I ſaw the Lord at that Time revealing his Covenant unto me; on which I was to build my Aſſurance, not on my Performance of that Covenant by my own Strength and Graces. <hi>Now God's Covenant I ſaw thus;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſaw him call me to himſelf, that he might make good his everlaſting Covenant: So I came.</p>

                     <hi>May</hi> 29. I was muſing on <hi>the Witneſs of the Spirit,</hi> And I conſidered as Men had their Voice; ſo that which <hi>he</hi> ſpake, whoſe <hi>Voice is moſt ſweet,</hi> is witneſſed to the Hearts of his People by the ſtill Voice of his Spirit.</p>
                  <p>I ſaw alſo that <hi>Chriſt lives,</hi> and hath overcome Death; and hence is ready to quicken all his he died

for; not to a Life different from his own, but with his own Life, and brings them to it, which was mighty thorough God; and this was a ſweet Support to me in Prayer, when I felt a Need of Redemption from all Sin by this Life.—So I ſaw that God did live, when he ſpake, when he quickened, and did work; and he was then a living God to me, when I heard his Voice and felt his Works upon me and in me; And to want theſe was to be eſtranged from the Life of God.</p>

                     <hi>May</hi> 30. On <hi>Sabbath Day</hi> after Sermon I ſaw that <hi>my Sin</hi> was (1) To look on my Miniſtry's Faults, and be diſcouraged. (2) To look on their good, and be puffed up. (3) If all was done well, then to look upon them, as if they were, <hi>Abſalom</hi>-like; that from the Head to the Foot of them there was no Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh. But I loathed my ſelf for it, and pray'd for everlaſting Bleſſing on them.</p>

                     <hi>June</hi> 8 <hi>I ſaw it my Duty to be and live in every Place as Chriſt in this World:</hi> To do that which he would do, and live and walk as he would walk, if

                  <p n="1">1. What Glory would this be to Chriſt?</p>

                     <hi>June</hi> 12. I thought if God was the Fountain of all Bleſſedneſs, that then (1) My Sins were great which ſtop'd it up, that I am ſo miſerable, and (2) That I was the more miſerable to ſtand without, and hear of the good Things in him, and taſte them not, enjoy them not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>June</hi> 13. On the <hi>Sabbath</hi> being <hi>weak in my Body and Spirits,</hi> I aſked, <q>Can God make Uſe of ſuch a poor Wretch to preach the Goſpel by?</q> And I conſidered <hi>Paul,</hi> (1) His Preſence was mean. (2) His Utterance weak. (3) His Weakneſs much. He was <hi>with the Theſſalonians in much Weakneſs;</hi> and it may be meant of bodily Infirmities, as well as bodily Perſecutions. (4) The Doctrine he delivered was but common, <hi>Repent</hi> and <hi>Believe.</hi> (5) He preached this in no Wiſdom of Words, but plainly; and yet the Lord accounting him faithful, bleſſed him. So the Lord could do by me moſt weak.</p>

                     <hi>June.</hi> 17. I ſaw that as by Chriſt I had Acceſs to the Father, ſo by Faith and Prayer of Faith I had Acceſs to Chriſt.—Again I ſaw how <hi>many if not moſt Men, were led and governed by certain Humours.</hi> Hence ſometimes light, ſometimes ſad: And Men were hence religious in Humour, diſcouraged alſo by the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of their Body.</p>

And I conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I muſt be like to Chriſt in communicating Good to others, as well as being united to him. And ſo I ſaw that, but for the Sake of others, and their Good, I would meddle no more with this World. And this ſet my Heart right and in a ſweet Frame. And I ſaw it was a Sign I ſought not my ſelf in a Duty, when I was (<hi>Autarchees</hi>

On the <hi>Sabbath-Day,</hi> in reading <hi>Beza</hi> on the 6th of <hi>Romans,</hi> I ſaw clearly two Things; (1) That the Saints receiving Chriſt by Faith have good Cauſe to be at perfect Peace in their own Conſcience, there being by Chriſt no more Conſcience of Sin; (2) That by this Faith they had by Chriſt's Death Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment of Sin. And I ſaw that this Faith was an
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:006067_0133_10275133319CBEA0"/>
Adherence to Chriſt; and ſuch a Kind of Adherence to him and Reſting on him, as that the Soul by dear Eſteem and Love clings ſo to him, as that it gets in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. It's ſo cloſe an Adherence, even as the Branch gets into the Stock. And ſo I ſaw Faith doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleave to Chriſt, but it ſticks in Chriſt, and ſo ſucks Life and Vigour from Chriſt by Eſteem and Love; and this I prayed for. And by this I ſaw, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fall ſhort of true Faith, whoſe Faith never makes them ſtick cloſe unto Chriſt Jeſus.</p>

                     <hi>June</hi> 27. On <hi>Sabbath,</hi> when I came Home, <hi>I ſaw the Hypocriſy of my Heart;</hi> that in my Miniſtry I ſought to comfort others and quicken others, that the Glory might reflect on me, as well as on God. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I conſidered, how ill the Lord took this, and how averſe he was from this Self-ſeeking. By the Sight of which I laboured to be averſe from it my Self, and purpoſed to carry it in Mind as one ſtrong Means to help againſt it for Time to come.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>June</hi> 27. I was in Prayer, perſwaded and ſtirred up to remember that <hi>by every Thing I ſhould ſeek to grow humble, to pick ſomewhat out of all Providences for that End;</hi> becauſe I ſaw my Heart grow light ſo quickly. And I farther conſidered, To pick Joy in God, and Loathing of my ſelf in every Thing which I ſaw in him, or in his Providence, was the only Way to grow in Grace, and improve his Providences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</p>

And I ſaw from hence my Sin, and the Advantage Sin had againſt me was by Means of the Creature and Pleaſures there. But when I ſaw all my Good in God and coming from God into them, my Heart was ſweetly calmed and endeared to God. And I ſaw how I ought to walk with God. And this

                  <p>
                     <hi>July</hi> 2. <hi>I ſaw I was no Debtor to the Fleſh,</hi> to ſerve it, either (1) for any Good it ever did me, (2) or by any Power over me, by Divine Juſtice ſatisfied in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>I ſaw it <hi>my Duty, not only to pray,</hi> but <hi>to live by Prayer and Begging;</hi> for I obſerved how ſome of God's People did ſo. Hence I ſaw, I was not to live by <hi>Providence</hi> only, but by <hi>Prayer,</hi> (1) for my ſelf, Body, Soul, (2) for my Children, and Family, at home and abroad, (3) for the Churches. Hereupon I aſked the Queſtion, Would the Lord have me to live by Prayer thus? And I ſaw he would have me, becauſe he had given me an Heart frameable to his Will therein; and it did much refreſh me to think, that the Lord ſhould deſire me to live thus, as if he took Delight in my ſinful Prayers. And ſo I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, <hi>how I might live by Prayer?</hi> And I ſaw (1) I ſhould ſee what Evils accompany every Thing I go about, (2) what Good I need to have conveyed by every Thing. There are ſpecial Evils of Sin to be avoided, and ſpecial Good Things to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed. And I aſked, <hi>why I was to live by Prayer?</hi> And I thought, (1) Becauſe it did honour God, (2) kept me from many unknown Evils which elſe would befal me: (3) Becauſe elſe I could not have Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance any other Prayers ſhould be heard, which were not my Life. To pray by Fits is not the Way to find Help in Time of Trouble.</p>

When I was at Meeting to receive in Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, I conſidered of <hi>the Reaſon why the Lord helped me to pray, and yet did not anſwer me;</hi> nay Things did not ſtir nor move, but rather Things in Church and elſe-where in Men's Spirits went worſe and worſe. So I ſaw hereby, what need I had of all the Prayers of others, and to get their Prayers with Faſtings with
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:006067_0135_10275134BB79CCB0"/>
me for thoſe Bleſſings which come hardly from the Lord. Yet I ſaw the Lord could anſwer eaſily and ſuddenly, but he would not: And the Reaſon was, (1) Becauſe he did delight in my Prayers, and hence he kept me (Muſician-like) aſking; (2) Becauſe he delighted in the Prayers of many together; (3) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would let me ſee I did need the Prayers of others, as well as my own. And I ſaw alſo that all Prayers of Faith are heard inſtantly in Heaven, but many Times they are not heard from Heaven until many Shoulders are ſet to the Work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July</hi> 7. I ſaw that notwithſtanding all my Sins, I ſhould ſee there was no Condemnation to me, nor ſhould I fear it; (1) being in Chriſt by Faith; (2) Walking after the Spirit, becauſe I reſiſted and mourned under the Fleſh and Body of Death, as <hi>Paul</hi> did. Yet I ſaw, I ſhould look upon all my Sins with an Eye of Lamentation, as being, (1) croſs to God, (2) ſo contrary to the Life of Chriſt in me. For I ſaw that I made a Difference of ſome Sins in a Chriſtian; (1) Some did cauſe God's fatherly Anger, and were more wilful, and Conſcience upbraided me for them; (2) Others were Weakneſſes, for which Chriſt pitied me. And here my Heart began to think, What need of ſuch bitter Mourning for them? Now I ſaw, the Apoſtle (<hi>Rom.</hi> 7.) mourned alike for all. He feared none for Condemnation; he mourned for all with bitter Lamentation. So I was ſweetly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, and purpoſed, thus to walk; and not to mourn only for ſuch Sins, as did hide the Face of my God, but for Sin in General, which goes againſt his Life, yea is contrary to the End of Chriſt's Death, and croſs to the Will of God. And I ſaw it my Duty to mourn, and that bitterly with unutterable daily Sighings under the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Wilderneſs among ſo many Snares. Yet conſidering, that through God's Providence we were fallen here; I ſaw it was my Duty, and purpoſed it ſhould be my Work to do all that I could, and be the more earneſt with God in Prayer, and to <hi>fingere Fortunam,</hi> make the beſt of what is, becauſe bad, at beſt.</p>
                  <p>I ſaw alſo, how ſome godly Men and Friends, who, though they were ſincere, yet were very weak, and could not go thorow the preſent Temptations of the Place of Wants, &amp;c, with that Contentedneſs and Sweetneſs of Spirit, as was meet. And when I ſaw that poſſibly it might not come from Want, but Weakneſs of Grace only; my Bowels yearned towards Chriſt's weak ones, and I was ſecretly raiſed up with Hopes, that the Lord Jeſus would pity them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were weak and faint, and would lead thoſe gently who were with Young. And it was ſpecial Ground of Faith and Prayer for them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July</hi> 9. Being ſuddenly ſurprized by a Sin before the Sacrament, my Conſcience was awakened, and my Heart checkt me for it. Yet the Lord turned the Meditation of the Evil of this Sin to great Good to me; viz, Not only to ſet my Heart againſt it and all other Sins, but the Lord thereby let in a moſt glorious Light (as I thought) of his Goſpel and of the Way of Believing for Pardon, more than ever I had: which was this;</p>
                  <p>I ſaw that the Nature and Practice of a Man awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened with Sin was this, viz. when Conſcience ſmites him with the Fear and Terror of God, <q>Doſt think God loves thee, or hath ſanctified thee, who doſt ruſh upon ſuch Evils again and again? No, he is angry with thee for thy Sin.</q> Hereupon the Heart being deſirous of Favour thinks <hi>ſecretly</hi> thus; As Sin hath provoked God's Anger, ſo, he being merciful, I hope the leaving off my Sin and turning from my Sin will pacify and pleaſe the Lord again; and ſo doth
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:006067_0137_10275137978001A8"/>
                     <hi>ſecretly</hi> think to pleaſe God and pacify God, and ſo indeed to ſatisfie God for that Sin, and ſo forſakes Sin. And now in Time of Sickneſs, or Horror thinks, that the Lord is pacified and pleas'd with this, according as ſome Scriptures <hi>ſeem</hi> to ſpeak. Or elſe it ſecretly thinks, Faith in Chriſt's Blood and Turning from Sin alſo, both together do pleaſe, and that now all is quiet. Hereupon, remembring that Chriſt's Blood appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by Faith was the only Atonement, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this was not the Way that I ſhould walk in; but rather this:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſaw that when the leaſt Sin, as well as the greateſt, was committed, my firſt Work was to ſee that I (in my ſelf conſidered) muſt die eternally for that Sin, and ſo ſhould paſs Sentence upon my Self for it. And here I ſaw that by this the Elect did, and that I ſhould, ſee how croſs and contrary and grievous Sin is to God, who is ſo incenſed by it, as he will be the Death of a Sinner for it. And ſo I ſaw that hereby my Soul ſhould be humbled aright, feeling Sin by this Means, not only as bringing eternal Death on me, but as being croſs and provoking to God. And this I ſaw was to be done, not only at firſt Converſion, but all my Life; <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.20. that ſo hereby the Soul might increaſe in Humiliation and in an high Eſteem of the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I ſaw, that next to this I was to fly to Chriſt's Blood and Righteouſneſ for Satisfaction and Peace. And here I ſaw three Things (1) That this was Faith, to fly to Chriſt's Death in Senſe of my own Death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (2) That this Act was exceeding pleaſing to God, even after all Sins: nay that it did pacify God, not becauſe of the Merit of the Act, but becauſe of the Worth of the Object, which is the Satisfaction of Chriſt's Death it apprehends, and that this doth pleaſe him, becauſe of his good Pleaſure and Purpoſe of Grace, and becauſe he will be ſo pleaſed: (3) That this
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:006067_0138_1027518804A6A898"/>
Satisfaction alone thus apprehended, did perfectly and without any Holineſs or Reformation of mine pacify and pleaſe the Father; or elſe I ſaw, that Chriſt's Death and Merits were imperfect and inſufficient. And if ſo, If this alone pleas'd him, then the Condition of the Goſpel was not thus, viz. If you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt's Death for Righteouſneſs, Pacification and Life, and if you be ſanctified and obey the Will of Chriſt, you ſhall then live, and God the Father will be pacified toward you by both theſe Means, but if you believe in Chriſt Jeſus and his Death, by this <hi>only</hi> you ſhall pleaſe God for whatever Sin you have committed. I ſaw the Conſcience of a Sinner could never be quieted until it did reſt on this Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony only, in ſeeing God pleaſed that Moment wherein it flies out of ſelf to the Death of Chriſt— Now becauſe I knew the Lord required Obedience and Sanctification, hence a Third Thing came clearly to mind.—</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I ſaw, that reſting thus on Chriſt, my Conſcience ſhould be quieted, that God was now pacified, and that I did now pleaſe him fully in Point of Satisfaction, yet I ſaw I was now required to do the whole Will of God, and to conform thereunto, not in Way of Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, to pacify God's eternal Anger, but in Way of Thankfulneſs for this the Lord's Love in being pleaſed with me, and that wherein I fell ſhort of it, I ſhould be deeply humbled with <hi>Paul, Romans</hi> 7. but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I did any Thing according thereto, to be thankful for it, as <hi>Paul</hi> alſo was, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. when he was glad that in his Mind he ſerved the Law of God—Now becauſe I ſaw I could do nothing, my Will being deſperately averſe from Chriſt's Will; Hence I ſaw (1) If Chriſt had pacified the Father and pleaſed Divine Juſtice for my Sin, that he would alſo by his Death deliver me from my Sins. (2) I ſaw that Chriſt did not require me now juſtified to ſubſiſt in my ſelf, and to be Self-confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:006067_0139_1027513E9AD487C0"/>
and to do with and from my own Strength, but that he would give me the Law of the Spirit of Life, which would enable me; and that the Obedience he would accept, as a Token of Thankfulneſs, was this, (1) That I ſhould reſt and rely upon his Death for the Spirit of Life, and on his Spirit for the Power of it to enable me to do his Will continually. (2) That if the Lord did enable me, I ſhould be exceeding thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for it, if not, that I ſhould be exceedingly humbled daily under it, and ſo ſtill forget Things which be behind, and reach to Things that be before. Relying on Chriſt for his Spirit I ſaw did and doth come and ariſe in all the Saints from the Law writ in the Heart, after it feels God pacified, and the Law of God without, which being reconciled together, and the Soul feeling it's own Weakneſs to pleaſe it, hence it relies on the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt Jeſus and thereby finds Help; the Spirit within us living on the Spirit without us, as the elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Bodies, on the Elements in other Bodies. So I ſaw, that by Faith in Chriſt's Death I pleaſed the provoked Juſtice and pacified the Anger of God; by the Law of God writ in my Heart and Obedience of the Spirit, I was pleaſed and did now pleaſe the Law of God, as now given to me by Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>Now when the Lord did ſhew me all this, I did bleſs him with my Soul for it, and I was taught how to walk more orderly. I ſaw (1) This was the right Way of Believing and finding Favour, becauſe it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Soul humbly from the Beginning to the End and exalted God's Grace. (2) I ſaw that hereby the Saints came to mourn more for Sin (which Familiſts do not) than any other Men. For when I ſee I muſt die for Sin, that makes me mourn; when I ſee how croſs it is to God, that makes me mourn ſtill; when I believe and ſee, only Chriſt's Death can pacify, and that I being come to it, it ſhall pacify, this makes me mourn more, and that bitterly, which no graceleſs Heart
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:006067_0140_1027518DC656B228"/>
can do, or hath Cauſe to do. (3) I ſaw, that in preaching Duties of Obedience to the Saints, I ſhould be careful how I ſet them a Meaſure, or ſet them to do them either to pacify Anger, or to perform them in their own Strength, or to make Doing of them an Evidence of Grace, without inſerting, <hi>Unleſs they go to Chriſt and rely on him for his Grace,</hi> enabling them thereunto; and to preach them to <hi>them</hi> only as Duties of Thankfulneſs; to <hi>others</hi> as Hand-writings of Death. (4) Hereby I ſaw how Sanctification was an Evidence of Reconciliation. (1) I ſaw, where it was not, there was no Reconciliation. (2) That where it was, there was Reconciliation. (3) That mediately it was an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and I was to take it as an Evidence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, <hi>Mediately,</hi> I ſay, becauſe Faith in Chriſt's Blood doth <hi>immediately</hi> aſſure me of it. But this, (viz. Sanctification) aſſures me that my Faith hath truly apprehended Chriſt Jeſus. 4. I ſaw that Faith did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately evidence Reconciliation. (1) Becauſe Faith is required in the Goſpel as the only Condition; Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification is required to come after it, is wrought after it, and commanded after it. (2) Becauſe I ſaw the Apoſtles had their Reconciliation by this Evidence. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Being juſtified by Faith, we have Peace with God.</hi> (3) I ſaw that Sanctification was not to come in to Pacification of God's Anger and Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and therefore not immediately to the Pacification of Conſcience. For Conſcience being ſmitten with Senſe of eternal Death, nothing can pacify Conſcience, but that which can pacify Juſtice, and that is the Death of Chriſt Jeſus apprehended by Faith. Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence only hath Quiet in Chriſt's Death, my Peace is only in it; but Faith only is that by which I came by it; becauſe Faith makes it mine own, brings it near me, and now it quiets me. It is not by an immediate Teſtimony, that <hi>Chriſt's Death is mine:</hi> for that may be a Deluſion, being without the Word;
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:006067_0141_1027514025321070"/>
but Chriſt's Death apprehended by me, and ſo teſtified by the Word and Spirit; the Word ſpeaking, Every Believer ſhall live; the Spirit of Adoption (enabling the Soul to ſee the Work of Faith in itſelf) ſpeaking, Thou, Believer ſhalt live. Which Spirit is given im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after my Juſtification by Faith, viz. in my Adoption to Sonſhip.</p>
                  <p>Now having Peace by Faith, my Conſcience will queſtion, Is thy Faith right? Now my Sanctification bears witneſs to <hi>that</hi> and ſo <hi>mediately</hi> ſhews me, that my Peace is right. In a Word,</p>
                  <p>The Matter of my Peace, or that wherein I have Peace, is Chriſt's Death. The Means of this my Peace is Faith only. The <hi>immediate</hi> Evidence of my Peace and Pacification is Faith apprehending Chriſt's Death. The Evidences being (1) the Word of the Goſpel, (2) the Spirit of Adoption diſcovering the Work of Faith in the Heart. The Evidence of the Truth of Faith, and ſo of my Peace is Sanctification. This only I queſtion, whether Faith ſaith, My Peace is made, and Sanctification ſaith, Thy Faith is good. Only I add, it's poſſible for ſome ſincere Chriſtians firſt to ſee their Sanctification and Holineſs, and ſo their Faith and Peace. But the Queſtion is, Whether they ſhould not firſt ſee their Faith and Peace, and ſo their Sanctification ariſing from thence? And ſo as Mr. <hi>Culverwell</hi> notes, not build their Faith upon their Life but their life upon their Faith, and their Faith upon God's free Grace.</p>
                  <p n="5">(5) I ſaw that the Reaſon why Faith in Chriſt's Blood, and not ſimply in Chriſt did juſtify and pacify, was becauſe an humbled Sinner ever feels and ſees <hi>Death</hi> before him; and hence the Lord, according to his Need, opens Chriſt and preſents him <hi>thus</hi> to him. As alſo, why <hi>Paul</hi> called Sin a Body of Death. (1) Becauſe he ſaw he muſt die for it; the Remnants of Sin were Death. (2) Becauſe they were croſs to the
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:006067_0142_102751922BB83320"/>
Life of Chriſt in him. All this was the Day before the Sacrament <hi>July</hi> 10. 1641. And I thought now I felt ſome Growth, which I came for in other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>On the Evening of this Day before the Sacrament, I ſaw it my Duty to ſequeſter my ſelf from all other Things for the Lord the next Day. And (1) I ſaw, I was to pitch on the right End, (2) on the Means, all Things to lead me to that End. I ſaw mine own Ends were, to procure Honour, Pleaſure, Gain to my ſelf and not the Lord: and I ſaw how impoſſible it was for me to attain thoſe Ends I ſhould attain, viz. To ſeek the Lord for himſelf, to lay up all my Honour, Pleaſure &amp;c. in him. Or if I did, it was for myſelf, becauſe good unto me. So the Lord helped me thus. To ſee,</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) If Honour, Pleaſure was good; Oh, how good was he who gave them, and could have cut me ſhort of them? And ſo my Heart was raiſed up a little unto God.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) I ſaw <hi>my Bleſſedneſs</hi> did not chiefly lie in receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Good and Comfort from God, and in God; but in <hi>holding forth the Glory of God and his Virtues.</hi> For 'tis, I ſaw, an amazing, glorious Object, to ſee God in a Creature; GOD ſpeak, GOD act: The Deity not being the Creature, and turned into it, but filling of it, ſhining thorow it: To be covered with God, as with a Cloud; or as a Glaſs Lantern, to have his Beams penetrate thorow it. Nothing is good but God; and I am no further good, than as I hold forth God. The Devil overcame <hi>Eve</hi> to damn her Self by telling her, ſhe ſhould be like God. O that's a glorious Thing! And ſhould not I be holy, and ſo be like him indeed?</p>
                  <p>Hereupon I found my Heart more ſweetly drawn to cloſe with God, thus as my End, and to place my Happineſs in it: And alſo I ſaw, it was my Miſery to
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:006067_0143_10275141F5E7E188"/>
hold forth Sin and Satan and Self in my Courſe: And I ſaw one of thoſe two Things I muſt do. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my Soul wanted Pleaſure, I purpoſed thus to hold forth God, and did hope it ſhould be my Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſo to do, as it would be my Pain to do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
                  <p>I alſo conſidered of the <hi>Nature of a Sacrament;</hi> and I thought <hi>if Chriſt was here preſent to prepare and bleſs the Ordinance, I ſhould believe.</hi> But I ſaw (1) Should I not believe, Chriſt did give me Meat, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs every Day he did lay the Cloath? (2) I ſaw, Should not I believe the Word by Miniſters, becauſe Chriſt doth not ſpeak it with his own Mouth? (3) I ſaw, Chriſt did command his Miniſters to do this in Remembrance of him; and if for Chriſt's Sake that he might be remembred and loved they do bleſs it, then he is faithful to make his Body and Blood preſent there, and ſo to make the Elements, <hi>Seals.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſaw alſo that the Elements were not only Seals to aſſure me that Chriſt's Word ſhould be made good to me believing; but alſo that Chriſt by ſacramental Union was given to me. I ſaw alſo, that my Heart did ſay and conclude, I ſhall fall from Chriſt after this Sacrament, and have no more Strength againſt my Sins or Weakneſſes than heretofore, nor Ability to live to him. Then I ſaw that the Sacrament was a <hi>Pledge</hi> that certainly I ſhould have Strength; and alſo that this that I ſhould have was a moſt ſweet Thing, viz. <hi>The Life of Chriſt now begun and perfected here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſaw alſo that the Sacrament was made to confirm <hi>this main Promiſe of the Covenant,</hi> That he will give himſelf away to all that will but only take him thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and gladly. And I ſaw, that it was my Duty every Sacrament to faſten that Promiſe and repeat it again, that ſo it might be of Power and Uſe to God's People in due Time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="39" facs="unknown:006067_0144_102751950450F330"/>
                     <hi>July</hi> 22. I ſaw the Lord was won't to ſuccour and hear the <hi>Prayers</hi> of his People ſo conſtantly for all Things, that when he denied them their Requeſts, they took it to Heart as though they were undone ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly. <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.2, 3. and I ſaw it my Duty ſo to do, and ſo to be affected, when God refuſed to hear my Cries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July</hi> 22. At <hi>Boſton-Lecture,</hi> when Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> was giving <hi>Thanks for the ſafe Arrival of the Paſſengers</hi> lately come over; my Heart queſtioned the Thing, why I ſhould be ſo thankful for them? And I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, if it were my own Caſe I would have Thanks ſo given for me, and glad of it. Then I conſidered (1) That they were dear to Chriſt and beloved of him; an hence my Heart began to love them dearly, and hence I rejoiced and was thankful. (2) That the Lord ſhould ſo reveal his Glory on them in preſerving of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July</hi> 23. At <hi>Charleſtown-Lecture,</hi> I hearing out of <hi>John</hi> 17.21. That <hi>Diſunion and Sitting looſe from Chriſt and his People</hi> was a Means to hide, and did, as it were, deny that Chriſt was come as ſent of the Father. My Heart was hence much affected with ſhame and ſecret Sorrow, purpoſing to cleave cloſer to Chriſt that only Chriſt might be ſeen in me.</p>
                  <p>As I was riding to the Sermon that Day, my Heart began to be much diſquieted by ſeeing almoſt all Men's Souls and Eſtates out of Order, and many Evils in Mens Hearts, Lives, Courſes. Hereupon <hi>my Heart began to withdraw it ſelf from my Brethren and others:</hi> But I had it ſecretly ſuggeſted to me, that Chriſt, when he ſaw Evils in any, he ſought to amend them, did not preſently withdraw from them, nor was not perplexed and vexed only with them. And ſo I conſidered, if I had Chriſt's Spirit in me, I ſhould do ſo. And when I ſaw that the Lord had thus overcome my Reaſonings and viſited me I bleſs'd his Name. I ſaw alſo, the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:006067_0145_102751D65957CB00"/>
Night before this, that a Child of God in his Solitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs did <hi>wreſtle againſt Temptations,</hi> and ſo overcome his Diſcontent, Pride and Paſſion: Another did reaſon and ſo wreſtle for his Temptation of Diſcontent &amp;c, and was overcome. <hi>Jonah</hi> indeed did reaſon for his Paſſion for a Time; but the Lord overcame his Spirit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 1. On <hi>Sabbath-Day</hi> when the Lord had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me ſome comfortable Enlargements, I ſearcht my Heart to ſee my Sin. And I ſaw,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There was ſome poor little Eye in Seeking <hi>the Name and Glory of Chriſt:</hi> But I ſaw it was but little, and that there was not ſuch a burning Deſire to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance it, as there ſhould be. And hence I ſaw, I was to be humbled for this.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I ſaw, that though I did ſeek Chriſt's Glory, yet I ſought it not only, but <hi>my own Glory</hi> too. And hereupon thinking, whether a Man might not have ſome Reſpect to his own Glory; The Lord taught me, that in meerly humane Acts, I might have ſome Reſpect unto it; but in the Miniſtry and that kind of Work, and ſo in all Work whereby I draw nigh unto him, this was ſuch Work above me, and ſo wholly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and God's Work, that I ſhould here have no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to my ſelf together with God. For I ſaw, God might have left me on the Dunghill, and not have betruſted me with only ſuch Work as this is. I hereupon deſired to be humbled, and that my Sins might be removed, that the Lord might ſucceed and bleſs me. And here I ſaw my Heart popiſhly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, to think God's Grace would work upon the Removal of my Sin. Whereas I ſaw, that <hi>Juſtice</hi> would not work for a Sinner, till Sin were removed: yet I ſaw, <hi>Grace</hi> might work for it's own Sake and bleſs my Labours and pardon and heal my Sin for its own Sake; and ſo make Removal of Sin, not the Cauſe, but the Effect of it's Working.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="unknown:006067_0146_10275199312B8258"/>
                     <hi>Auguſt</hi> 2. In Prayer my Heart was very deſirous of having the <hi>Generation to come</hi> know, love and fear the Lord; and my Heart was hereupon much enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſet upon <hi>Catechiſing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſaw alſo what a ſweet Thing it was, not only to have <hi>Sinners converted,</hi> but to have the <hi>Saints edified,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt's Work go forward in them;</hi> that if it did ſo, all Things would proſper, even outward Things; whereas elſe I did fear all our Woes are yet behind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Auguſt</hi> 13. I ſaw [1] that I was <hi>worthy to be left to my ſelf</hi> and in my Miſery and Sin, (1) Not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I had ſinned; but (2) Becauſe of my very De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to come out of it. For I ſaw they did ariſe from Pride; that when I ſaw how God did not proſper me nor any that did come under my Shadow; and that he left me in the Dark, and hid his Face and Secrets from me; then, when God had caſt me down, I would take hold on the Lord and ſeek to climb up on him, that he might exalt me, and that I might be exalted by being lifted up by him. Whereas I ſaw it was my Duty, when I was low (1) To be afflicted and mourn, and learn the Bitterneſs of Sin, and my own Unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>James</hi> 4. (2) To be deſirous to come out only in Regard of the Lord, that he may be exalted in me and by me. And I did think the Lord ſet my Heart in ſuch a Frame at that Time. I ſaw my vile Heart alſo, that I could be troubled at Sin, when it was croſs to me.</p>
                  <p n="2">[2] I ſaw <hi>my Heart very ready to neglect Prayer</hi> for two Cauſes; (1) From thinking, that I had prayed enough, when I had prayed earneſtly and had no more Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to uſe. But I ſaw that all Prayer was little enough for that End, to help down Mercy. The Lord would have me get Mercy hardly, though all the Friends I had, prayed for me. (2) Becauſe I thought God would hear and forgive Sin and heal my Soul. But
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:006067_0147_102751D7E38CE038"/>
I ſaw if he did it, I muſt daily mourn under it and ſo get Strength againſt it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Auguſt</hi> 15. I ſaw on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> four Evils that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend me in my Miniſtry.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Devil either treads me down by <hi>Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Shame:</hi> (1) from the Senſe of the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of what I have provided in private Meditations; and to this I ſaw alſo an Anſwer, viz. That every Thing ſanctified to do Good, it's Glory is not ſeen in it's ſelf, but in the Lord's ſanctifying of it. Or (2) from an Apprehenſion of the Unſavorineſs of Men's Spirits, and their Unreadineſs to hear in hot or cold Seaſons. But here I ſaw, I ought not to be as a Reed ſhaken with the Wind.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Or <hi>Careleſſneſs</hi> poſſeſſeth me: ariſing (1) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have done well and been enlarged, and have been reſpected formerly, and hence 'tis no ſuch Matter though I be not always alike. (2) A natural Dulneſs and Cloudineſs of Spirit which doth often prevail.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Infirmities and Weakneſs:</hi> (1) Want of Light, (2) Want of Life, (3) Want of a Spirit of Power to deliver what I am affected with for Chriſt. And hence I ſaw many Souls not ſet forward, nor God <hi>felt</hi> in my Miniſtry.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Want of Succeſs</hi> when I have done my beſt.</p>
                  <p>I ſaw theſe and that I was to be humbled for theſe, I ſaw alſo many other Sins, and how the Lord might be angry. And this Day, in muſing thus I ſaw, that when I ſaw God angry, I ſought to pacify him by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from all Sin for Time to come: But then I remembred (1) That my Righteouſneſs could not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie, and that this was reſting on my own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: (2) I ſaw I could not do it. (3) I ſaw, Only Chriſt's Righteouſneſs ready made and already finiſhed, fit for that Purpoſe—And I ſaw that God's afflicting me for my Sin was, not that I ſhould go and ſatisfie by Reforming, but only that I might be humbled and
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:006067_0148_1027519C0B028EC8"/>
afflicted for and ſeparated from Sin, being reconciled and made righteous by Faith on Chriſt, which I ſaw a little of that Night.</p>
                  <p>This Day alſo I found <hi>my Heart very untoward and ſad, and heavy by muſing on many Evils to come.</hi> But I ſaw if I carried four Things in my Mind alway, I ſhould be comforted.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That in my ſelf I am a dying condemned Wretch; but by Chriſt I am reconciled and live.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In my ſelf, and all Creatures, finding Inſufficiency and no Reſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Feeble and unable to do any Thing my ſelf; but in Chriſt able to be efficient and to do all Things.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Though I enjoyed all theſe but in Part in this World; yet I ſhould have them all perfectly, ſhortly in Heaven; where God will ſhew himſelf fully recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, be alone ſufficient and efficient and aboliſh all Sin, and live in me perfectly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 17. I ſaw <hi>my Neglect of my ſelf, Family and others.</hi> And I ſaw the Reaſon of it was, becauſe the Lord did me Good without <hi>Prayer</hi> and bleſs'd all Things to me without it. Hence I ſaw how juſt and righteous it was for the Lord to take every outward ordinary Bleſſing from me, becauſe I might then be obliged to get them and keep them by Prayer; And that the Lord ſhould continually exerciſe me with great Affliction, that I might hereby pray. And I ſaw that it was Wiſdom for me to pray for all I had, as all Things were taken from me; and to pray for them out of Duty, willingly and not of Neceſſity to bring God's Purpoſes to paſs by Prayer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 21. On <hi>Saturday</hi> at Even I was praying, and the Lord made himſelf very precious to me, becauſe I might come to him, have <hi>Acceſs in Prayer</hi> (1) At any Time, (2) might lay open all my Wants with Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to him, (3) with Certainty of ſpeeding. And when I ſaw that my great Sin did lie in not keeping
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:006067_0149_102751D96FC9FA70"/>
the Savour (at leaſt) of the Lord and his Ways, I did thereupon ſee, (1) that the Remembrance of this Truth would be one Means to maintain it, as it gave it; (2) I ſaw there is no Wrath like this to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by my own Luſts for my own Ends.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 24. I ſaw [1] that the Means of being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable was Senſe of God's Sufficiency and Efficiency by Faith. [2] I ſaw that I was not made immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by reſting on my Faith, and the Reſt of Faith which ſometimes I felt; but by reſting on God as only able to ſupport my Faith, and me by it. [3] I ſaw how exceeding ſhort I fell of that Holineſs God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. And hence I ſaw the Reaſon why Men ſeek after no more Holineſs, nor are more holy, is (1) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they think, they are holy as God would have them, and as other Chriſtians be: They ſet up their Pitch: Or (2) becauſe of their Impotency and Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and they could do no more than they did. [4] I ſaw there is great Matter of Humbling, that I am not ſo holy as I <hi>ſhould</hi> be; but am infinitely ſhort; but much more, that I am not ſo holy as I <hi>might</hi> be through Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Auguſt</hi> 28, 29. <hi>When I came from Preaching,</hi> I ſaw <hi>my own Weakneſs</hi> (1) of Body to ſpeak (2) of Light and Affection within, and Enlargement there; and that my weak Mind, Heart and Tongue moved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out GOD's ſpecial Help. (3) I ſaw my Weakneſs to bleſs what I did. Hereupon I queſtioned, whether the Lord would ever bleſs one ſo impotent, that did my Work without his Power, and ſinned ſo much with ſuch dead, heartleſs, blind Work: And I feared he would not. But then I conſidered (1) That God doth ſhew his Power by the <hi>Much-ado</hi> of our Weakneſs to do any Thing. God works not by ſtrong, but <hi>weak Things.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.21. He makes <hi>fooliſh Things</hi> and <hi>weak Things</hi> and <hi>Things that are not,</hi> to do his Work; <hi>that no Fleſh might glory.</hi> (2) I ſaw that if he did ſo,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:006067_0150_1027519D943391E0"/>
then the more weak I was, the more fit was I to be uſed; and that he could bleſs his own Ordinance by me. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. His Power pitcheth his Tents in Weakneſs. (3) I ſaw that the Lord (as weak as I am) had bleſſed my poor Labours; and if he ſhould do it ſtill, Oh how ſhould I give the Glory to him! So my Heart was much affected and did give the Glory of all was ever done by me to God. And I thought I did now begin to do, what I ſhould do for ever in Heaven. And I ſeeing that by this Way God ſhould be glorified, I began to <hi>rejoice,</hi> with <hi>Paul,</hi> in <hi>my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,</hi> and my Heart began to be raiſed up from ſinking under them: Becauſe I thought I was bound to rejoice in God, that by my Weakneſs he would glorify himſelf. And I began to ſee how good it was to acknowledge and not be aſhamed of my Weakneſſes before others, that they might ſee the more clearly the Glory of God: Nor to be diſcouraged with them before, nor after my Work.</p>
                  <p>Yet here was left one Scruple, How that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's were filled with the Spirit of Power and Strength in their Work, and ſo God bleſs'd as 1 Theſſ. 1.4? I thought the Apoſtle's were weak <hi>before</hi> their Work; but were they ſo <hi>in</hi> their Work? Did the Lord by weak Work in and upon them do any Good? So I mourned. For a little before this Time, I obſerved, <hi>Weakneſs to do Chriſt's Work, and Shame ever went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;</hi> and that Weakneſs of Body, and Neglect of Duty went together.</p>
                  <p>So I prayed that Evening immediately, that the Lord would accept me in Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, and make me ſtrong and zealous for him and his Name; nay, that Chriſt himſelf would be zealous to get him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Name by me, who was but a worthleſs Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his Hand; and ſo I reſted with ſome Hope, that he would. And reſolved to walk in Senſe of my Weakneſs and Vileneſs daily before him.</p>

                     <hi>September</hi> 5. I was on <hi>Sabbath-Day Night</hi> ſecretly <hi>ſwelling againſt God, that he did not bleſs my Miniſtry.</hi> But then, remembring my Sins, how I deſerved Death eternally, I was ſoon quieted; and I bleſſed God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly for my Life, and that the Lord was not yet gone out of Hearing, but that I might come to him privately, and in extraordinary Duties and pray. So I prayed earneſtly for Favour and Love of Chriſt and God in Chriſt, and for a Multitude of Mercies. And I prayed ſo long, until my Heart was made ſuitable unto Mercy; ſo as I prized nothing elſe, but God's Favour, ſo as my Heart did find Reſt there, and was quiet with it; which gave me ſome ſweet Peace. And I began to believe, Mercy was mine, becauſe my Heart was confined to it, and filled with it, and did reſt on it, and with it. For I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, the Heart of all ungodly Men is raviſhed and runs out to Creatures and finds Reſt there only. And ſo I fell to bleſſing God and praying for the Fruits of God's reconciled Love; and among other Things to bleſs my Miniſtry. And in doing this a Deſire came in, viz. That the Lord would not bleſs <hi>my</hi> Words, but <hi>his own</hi> Word, becauſe 'tis his own. Becauſe I am ſure he will bleſs his own Children and make them Bleſſings; ſo I was ſure the Lord would bleſs his own Word, becauſe it is his own.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sept.</hi> 5. I ſaw in Prayer, that there was none almoſt that did make Conſcience to grow nearer to God one Day than another Day; but left that to God, without much Care.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sept.</hi> 8. I ſaw the Reaſon why I did walk no more humbly and holily was, becauſe <hi>I did make the Creature ſomething, and did not make God all Things.</hi> God is all; He that poſſeſſeth him, poſſeſſeth ſomething, yea all Things. So long as the Creature is ſomething, that ſomething will ſtand betwixt God and me, that I ſhall not walk only in his Sight. This therefore is manify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:006067_0152_102751A1FA83E390"/>
of God, to make him <hi>All,</hi> the Fountain of all Goodneſs and Excellency!</p>
                  <p>I ſaw in my Sleep that Night, that a Chriſtian was to act not only from a natural Power of Grace, which doth act with all its Might where it is; but by a Power ſupernatural, whereby he attempts Things above his own Might, and bears Evils above his Might. So that now I ſee a Chriſtian ſhould act for Chriſt with all his Might and beyond his Might, having the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Power of Chriſt to help him thereunto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sept.</hi> 9. I ſaw the <hi>Vileneſs of Neglect of God in Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> becauſe the Neglect of Duties is the <hi>formalis Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectus,</hi> the proper Effect of lying in my Falls, in my Sins.</p>
                  <p>I ſaw on the <hi>Faſt-Day</hi> alſo, that (1) every Way I looked, there was Matter of Sorrow, in me, about me, Sin againſt God in Heaven, nay againſt Chriſt, nay croſs to his Will, his Love, nay his Life: Hence I ſhould mourn. (2) I ſaw I had no Comforter to go to, when I had thus ſinned againſt the Lord, no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.—</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sept.</hi> 13. In my Meditations at Night, I found <hi>my Heart deſirous to live in this World and do Good here, and not to die.</hi> Hence I aſked my Heart the Reaſon why I ſhould not be deſirous to die? And in muſing on it I ſaw that Chriſt was aſcended up to <hi>Heaven;</hi> that ſo not <hi>here,</hi> but <hi>there</hi> all his Elect might one Day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his Glory and love him and glorify him for ever. And I ſaw that this was God's main Plot and the End of all, to make Chriſt very glorious, and ſo beloved in Heaven for ever, where that which I deſired moſt in this World (<hi>viz.</hi> that Chriſt might not only be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, but very dear and precious) ſhould be perfectly accompliſhed: and hereupon I ſecretly deſired this Mercy and deſired it for my Child and Brethren and all the Churches; That, though we were blind here, and knew him not, loved him little, yet that this might
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:006067_0153_102751E4CA427AE8"/>
be our Portion at laſt. And I did feel my Deſires ſtirred up after this out of ſecret Love to Chriſt Jeſus. It would do me good, if he might be at laſt magnified thus. Then I enquired, <hi>what is the great Thing I ſhould deſire in this World?</hi> And I ſaw it was the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of that which ſhould be perfected in Heaven; viz. (1) To ſee and know CHRIST, though obſcurely. (2) To take Chriſt and receive him, and poſſeſs him. (3) To love him. (4) To bleſs him in my Heart, with my Mouth, by my Life. And in this laſt Clauſe I ſaw, that I ſhould ſtudy and ſtand for <hi>Diſcipline</hi> and <hi>all the Ways of Worſhip</hi> out of <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> viz. To ſhew my Thankfulneſs. And ſo I ſaw, I was (1) to ſeek for to know <hi>Chriſt's Will</hi> out of <hi>Love</hi> (2) To <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain</hi> it in <hi>Love,</hi> when found out (3) To <hi>keep</hi> it in <hi>Love.</hi> And ſo I ſaw it was my Duty, and ought to be my Care, to keep this very Frame of Heart daily; and I ſaw it would be glorious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>September</hi> 17. On <hi>Friday-Night,</hi> I wiſhed <hi>that Chriſt would break out in greater Glory</hi> to <hi>my Child</hi> than he had done to my ſelf; which gave me Matter to enquire, <hi>whether Chriſt had appeared to me in Glory, or no?</hi> And I ſaw, that then Chriſt breaks out in his Glory, when he ſo ſhews himſelf as that he ſpoils the Creature of all his Glorying, and makes him poor in Spirit, and ſo to ſee all his Good in Chriſt and there into Glory.</p>
                  <p>Now I ſaw that Night (1) That all Sin was in me, and all Shame did belong to me. (2) I ſaw all Good in Chriſt, and all Glory belonging to him. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I was comforted, and hoped the Lord had ſhewed me his Glory. And I ſaw an Error in my Heart; for I thought that then Chriſt appears in his Glory, when he affects the Heart with Wonderment at his Perſon by ſome ſtrange Light, and ſo filled the Soul with glorious Activities of Grace: Whenas I ſaw, that was the trueſt ſweeteſt Revelation of Chriſt's Glory, which did eclipſe all my Glory, and laid a
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:006067_0154_102751A66317DF18"/>
Foundation of glorying only in him. And this I ſaw was that which is in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. I ſaw my Tongue and Soul unclean, and all Good in him. Yet I ſaw one Part of Chriſt's Glory not yet revealed: For though he had ſo ſhewn his Glory to me, as to damp all my own perſonal Glory; yet he had not ſo ſhewn me his Glory, as to damp all the Glory of all the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Pleaſure and good Things in this World: which I therefore prayed for; for I ſaw Honour had a Glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>September</hi> 19. On <hi>Sabbath-Day</hi> I was at Prayer at Night and <hi>I ſaw my Heart ever and anon ready to caſt away my Faith and Confidence,</hi> as if it were of my own making. But the Lord let me ſee, that by Faith only I ſhould apprehend and have God; and hence I ſaw, if I caſt away my Faith, I muſt caſt away my God. Now I felt God very precious, and Chriſt very precious, and hence my Faith was very precious to me. And I ſaw it was no Preſumption to make God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, or to keep him with me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Octob.</hi> 2. On <hi>Saturday Night</hi> and <hi>this Morning</hi> I ſaw, and was much affected with <hi>God's Goodneſs</hi> unto me, the leaſt of my Fathers Houſe, <hi>to ſend the Goſpel unto me.</hi> And I ſaw what a great Bleſſing it would be to <hi>my Child,</hi> if he may have it, that by my Means it comes unto him. And ſeeing the Glory of this Mercy, the Lord ſtirred up my Heart to deſire the Bleſſing and Preſence of his <hi>Ordinances</hi> in this Place, and the Continuance of his poor <hi>Churches</hi> among us, looking on them as Means to preſerve and propagate the Goſpel. And my Heart was for this End very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of Mercy, outward and inward to ſuſtain them, for his own Mercy's Sake. And ſo I ſaw, one ſtrong Motive to pray for them, even <hi>for Poſterity's Sake,</hi> rather than in <hi>England,</hi> where ſo much Sin and Evil was abounding, and where Children might be polluted.
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:006067_0155_102751E655971D68"/>
And I deſired to know the Lord better, that I might make him known to this Generation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Octob.</hi> 6. I ſaw in Prayer, that <hi>my great Sin was my continual Separation, Diſunion, Diſtance from God,</hi> (not ſo much this or that particular Sin) lying out in a looſe Spirit from God. Hereupon I ſaw <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> near me, next unto me, becauſe he comes in as <hi>Mediator</hi> between <hi>God</hi> and my Soul. As one in a Pit, a mid Man holds both him below and him above. I ſaw that none could come into the Chaſma, the Breach Sin had made, but he that ſatisfied Juſtice, this Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. Hereupon my Heart was ſtirred up with Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to lay hold upon this Mediator, Chriſt Jeſus; the Object of Faith being ſo near unto me, and being of ſuch Worth, as to fill up the Chaſma, the Breach; and ſuch Love, as to come ſo near unto me. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered alſo that Chriſt was moſt near unto me by his Word and the Voice of that. Chriſt between God and me that were diſtant, the Word between Chriſt and me, and Faith cloſing with the Word, between the Word and me: the Word on Chriſt's Part, Faith on our Part. <hi>The Word is nigh thee, Rom.</hi> 10. which is the Word of Faith. And hence oppoſe the Word, and you oppoſe the Lord where he is, and wherein he is moſt near. Hence receive the Word and you receive the Lord, wherein he is moſt near.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Octob.</hi> 10. When I ſaw <hi>the Gifts and the Honour at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending them in another,</hi> viz. T. H, <hi>I began to affect ſuch an Excellency.</hi> And I ſaw hereby, that uſually in my Miniſtry I did affect an Excellency, and hence ſet upon the Work: Whereas the Lord hereupon humbled me for this, by letting me ſee, this was a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abolical Pride. And ſo the Lord made me thankful in ſeeing it, and put me in Mind to watch againſt it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Octob.</hi> 6. I was <hi>very ſad to behold outward Wants</hi> of the Country; and what would become of me and mine, if we ſhould want Cloaths and go naked and
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:006067_0156_102751A942750B28"/>
give away all to pay our Debts. Hereupon the <hi>Lord</hi> ſet me upon prizing of <hi>his Love,</hi> and the Lord made my Heart content with it: (1) His Love, though he denied me all Bleſſings, (2) Hence I deſired to know it, (3) To conſtrain my Heart by it (4) That I might not abuſe but Honour it. And there I left my ſelf, and beg'd this Portion for my ſelf, and for my Child, and for the Church; and ſo left them in the Lord's Bowels.—Now ſuch was the Goodneſs of Chriſt, that when I came to hear <hi>my Father</hi> preach at <hi>Boſton</hi> the <hi>Day after,</hi> my Soul was ſettled on the ſame Way again, when he preached about Contentedneſs: And ſo I was confirmed in the Faith: and ſo I learned how a Chriſtian is confirmed, (1) When he hears the ſame Thing preached at one Time, or by one Man, confirmed again by another Man, or at another Time; (2) When he learns ſomething privately, and then he hears the ſame again publickly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>October</hi> 9. On <hi>Saturday Morning,</hi> I was <hi>much affected for my Life;</hi> that I might live ſtill to ſeek, that ſo I might ſee God, and make known God before my Death. And then I ſaw, If there was ſuch Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs for Deliverance from <hi>Miſery,</hi> would it not be a greater Mercy to be delivered and redeemed from Sin? And I ſaw that this was a greater Mercy. And hence I ſaw the Love of Chriſt in afflicting and trying me with Wants; becauſe by theſe Trials I came to ſee <hi>my Sin</hi> and to have a Heart ſevered from my Sin. And ſo I ſaw, there was no Anger, but Love, nay the greateſt Love in this, viz. his redeeming Love from my Sin. Hereupon I learnt three Things; (1) That Soul which felt Sin the greateſt Evil, he would be willing, nay glad, if the Lord would redeem him out of it, though by any Miſery, Wants, Sorrows, Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; (2) When he was delivered, he would be as much thankful as for redeeming him from Hell: (3) He would account this the higheſt Teſtimony of God's
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:006067_0157_102751E8215399D8"/>
Love, by redeeming him out of the greateſt Woe. And hence they that take Sanctification as no Sign of Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, never truly felt the Evil of Sin.—While I was thus muſing in Prayer, I ſaw, that then my Soul was ſevered from Sin, indeed, when CHRIST JESUS came to be in my Soul in the Room of <hi>my Sin;</hi> when he was dear as Sin had been dear; when he did rule as Sin had once ruled me. And I thought this was ſweet, if God would do ſo; and reaſonable alſo, that it ſhould be ſo; and I began to make the Lord ſo indeed unto me. And ſo I learnt <hi>this Rule,</hi> viz, <hi>That if ever I would have any Sin ſubdued, do not labour to get the Sin ſubdued only; but get Chriſt to come in the Room of it;</hi> that his Sweetneſs may be there, Power there, Life there, and to ſeek then for the contrary Grace from Chriſt. For (1) It may be long before Chriſt will come and give the Grace, and ſo the Soul may lie miſerable; but Chriſt my be then had. (2) At Vocation Chriſt is given firſt, and then Sanctification. So in the renewed Converſions of the Saints, 'tis to be ſo again. (3) Elſe I ſeek for Chriſt's Virtues without Chriſt:—And curſed be that Soul that is loth to have Chriſt to be in the Room of a baſe Luſt, to make Chriſt that to him which a vile Luſt once was.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Octob.</hi> 16. The Day before the Sacrament, the Lord helped me to call to mind (1) <hi>my Neglects,</hi> (2) <hi>My Wants.</hi> [1] <hi>My Neglects;</hi> (1) Of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in private toward my ſelf (2) To my Wife, Child, Family, Church, Companions abroad; not inſtructing, exhorting, quickning, being an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to them. And the Lord let me ſee the Cauſe of all this to be (1) Ignorance; I know not how to ſpeak to them, nor about what. (2) Unſavorineſs; not delighting in, but loathing ſuch Ways. (3) Pride; Becauſe I could not do ſo well as I would, I would not ſpeak what I could. (4) Lukewarmneſs; in
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:006067_0158_102751AACBF86078"/>
not being carried out for God's Glory. (5) Idleneſs and Sluggiſhneſs, loth to ſtir. (6) Love of Study. (7) Want of tender Love. (8) Apprehenſion of Unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; in Caſe I ſhould attempt, I ſhould do no Good, and hence would not ſow Seed upon Rocks. And I thought, If this latter ſhould hinder me, why ſhould it not diſcourage the Lord himſelf, who had ſo oft caſt his precious Seed upon my Rocks, and loſt all? And here I ſaw, I was ignorant when to ſpeak and how to do, and how much; Yet I ſaw this, that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I had done right, yet that theſe Principles cauſing this Neglect were to be lamented, and not indulged, for which End I came to the Lord in the Sacrament. For I ſaw that good Duties might be done, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lawfully omitted, and yet both out of <hi>ill Principles.</hi> And when the ill Principles are healed, I ſhall then ſee whether it is my Duty, and how far my Duty reacheth. And this I ſaw was <hi>a Rule of ſingular Uſe</hi> to know when the Thing was evil, which I think is right and good. I ſay it is lawful; Be it ſo; but ſee if this lawful Thing comes not from an ill Principle. Cure that, and then other Things will follow. So a Man ſtrives for upper Place, and who ſhall be the greateſt: A Man thinks Uſury is lawful: Now, ſay I, mind <hi>the Principle</hi> whence theſe come.</p>
                  <p n="2">[2] I ſaw <hi>my Wants.</hi> (1) I did want Knowledge of the Truth and Glory of God's Will in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (2) Wiſdom to guide others (3) Daily Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: The Want of which made the Lord not to pity me, nor to come to me. (4) I was exerciſed with Horrors and Fears, being in the Dark, and the Lord hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Face. (5) Want of a Spirit of Prayer diſtreſs'd me; having Words without Affection, which I ſaw the Perfection of all Miſery.—(6) Want of Zeal for God's Glory; but affecting mine own Glory and mine own Excellency, nay the Excellencies of God for that End. (7) Want of Joy in the Lord and in his
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:006067_0159_102751EDADAF8E80"/>
Will; but going a whoring after lawful Things. (8) Want of Love in great Meaſure to others.</p>
                  <p>I meditated this Night upon CHRIST, and ſaw (1) That there was a neceſſity of a <hi>Mediator</hi> in Regard of God's Truth and Holineſs. (2) That this was the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> by the Witneſſes given of him. (3) I ſaw not that he was mine, becauſe I ſaw no Promiſe abſolute of it. But the Lord graciouſly cleared up to me <hi>John</hi> 1.12. That they who receive Chriſt were Sons. (Chriſt himſelf, though they had no Promiſe.) Now to receive Chriſt I ſaw was contrary to them that did not own him when he came to his own. (1) They did not acknowledge, <hi>This is he.</hi> (2) They did not ſee any Glory in him. (3) They did not embrace him with all their Hearts to be that to them for which End he came; viz. To be King, Prophet and Prieſt. So I ſaw what it was to receive him. And upon a freſh Perſwaſion that this Meſſiah is he, the Lord gave me to embrace me him with my Affections, as if preſent; viz. To guide me as a Prophet, to rule me as a King, to take away Sin and Death as a Prieſt.—Now here I ſaw two Things, [1] That <hi>true Faith</hi> was not to guide one's Self, rule and conquer Sin, and obey one's Self; (for this is to make our ſelves our own Saviours;) But to cleave to Chriſt that will do all this, nay that he would draw out our Faith of embracing him for this. And hence I ſaw <hi>Neglect of Duty</hi> as vile a Sin as <hi>actual Sin;</hi> becauſe Chriſt is not ſo much offended with us for actual Sin, as for not coming to him and claſping about him to take theſe away. The one, viz. to do the thing is his Work; but to cleave to him is our chief Work.—And I was confirmed, that this is the right Act of Faith; (1) Becauſe Faith is a bare Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver; (2) From <hi>John</hi> 4.10. If thou wouldſt aſk, he would give. [2] I ſaw Faith weak and divided, and many Sins would be ſtill in me; that with this Faith there was a Neceſſity of <hi>daily Repentance.</hi> This
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:006067_0160_102751B06414EC58"/>
Repentance, I ſaw, conſiſted chiefly in mourning for the Sin which Chriſt by Faith had not yet removed. Now I ſaw I was to mourn; (1) For not going to Chriſt to take away my Sin, which I daily forget; (2) For the Evil of my Sin, (and it's Croſſneſs to him) which he takes not away; (3) For his not taking it away, that I give him Cauſe to leave me; ſo (4) As having crucified him. And here I ſaw I had no Reaſon to continue in Sin; (1) Becauſe it had wounded Chriſt; (2) Becauſe Chriſt died that it might die and not live. And thus my Soul was ſweetly ſtayed upon Chriſt by Faith this Day, and much comforted.—Yet I ſaw there might be a <hi>Deceit</hi> in <hi>one Thing,</hi> viz. in Reaſoning and bringing my Heart to do a Duty by the Power of that; (1) To believe a Truth, not only by Means of Reaſon, but only upon that Ground, becauſe it agrees to right Reaſon: as that Chriſt muſt ſuffer, becauſe elſe God muſt be falſe and his Word not true; (2) To do a Duty from the Perſwaſion of Reaſon, becauſe it pleaſeth me, not becauſe it pleaſeth the LORD.</p>
                  <p>And here I ſaw, if it was from <hi>Reaſon,</hi> the Power of Reaſon would never carry me againſt my own Will and my own Ends.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Octob.</hi> 18. On <hi>Monday Morning, my Child was born.</hi> And when my Wife was in Travail, the Lord made me pray that ſhe might be delivered, and the Child given in Mercy, having had ſome Senſe of Mercy the Day before at the Sacrament; and the Lord ſtayed my Heart there. But I began to think, What if it ſhould not be ſo, and her Pains be long, and the Lord remember my Sin? and I began to imagine and trouble my Heart with Fear of the worſt. And I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood at that Time, that my Child had been born, and my Wife delivered in Mercy already. Hereupon I ſaw the Lord's Mercy and my own Folly, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet my Heart with Fear of what never ſhall be, nor will be; and not rather to ſubmit to the Lord's Will;
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:006067_0161_102751F238260218"/>
and come what can come, to be quiet there. When it was born, I was much affected, and my Heart clave to the Lord who gave it. And Thoughts came in, that this was the Beginning of more Mercy for Time to come. But I queſtioned, Will the Lord provide for it? And I ſaw that the Lord had made Man to great Glory, to praiſe him, and hence would take Care of him. Though ſometimes the Lord ſeemed to make all Men for nought, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. Which Place I thus underſtood: God hath made Man for the Glory of himſelf, and hence to great Glory; (though he made many for Nought) eſpecially the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>their Poſterity</hi> did the Lord make for Glory: And if God did not glorify them, then he ſeemed indeed to make all Men for Nought; and that when Men are not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of his Glory, 'tis for Nought.—And I ſaw God had Bleſſings for all my Children; and hence I turned them over to God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Octob.</hi> 29. I was <hi>much troubled about the Poverty of the Churches;</hi> and I ſaw it was ſuch a Miſery as I could not well diſcern the Cauſe of, nor ſee any Way out: Yet I ſaw we might find out the Cauſe of any Evil by the Lord's Stroke. Now he ſtruck us in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Bleſſings, and hence 'tis a Sign there was our Evil; (1) In not acknowledging all we have from God, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.8. (2) In not ſerving God in the having of them, (3) In making ourſelves ſecure and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted: For lawful Bleſſings are the ſecret Idols, and do moſt Hurt: And 'tis then a Sign our greateſt Hunt lies in Having, and that the greateſt Good lies in God's taking them away from us. Whereupon I conſidering this, did ſweetly content my ſelf that the Lord ſhould take all from us, if it might be not in Wrath, but in Love, viz. hereby to glorify himſelf the more, and to take away the Fuel of our Sin. I ſaw that if God's People could be joyfully content to part with all to the Lord, prizing the Gain of a little Holineſs
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:006067_0162_102751B3462BA2B8"/>
more than enough to overballance all their Loſſes, that the Lord then would do us Good.</p>

                     <hi>Octob.</hi> 31. On <hi>Sabbath-Day</hi> after Sermon, on my Bed, I ſaw (1) that my own weak Spirit would not carry me along in my Work. (2) I ſeeing I wanted Light and Life and Affection, and that I was not a burning and ſhining Light; I ſaw this came from the Want of the Spirit of Light and Life. And ſo I ſaw I was ſenſual, wanting the Spirit. Hereupon I did queſtion whether the Lord would accept of ſuch Services. For I read not in Scripture of any Miniſter, but it was better with him: He was filled with Light, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, Perſwaſion, &amp;c.—I conſidered hereupon this; [1] The Lord might reject my Services, if they were as good as I could wiſh; and [2] if therefore he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted theſe of mine, (1) I ſhould magnifie his Grace the more, (2) There would be the more Grace ſhewn. But I had ſome Queſtionings, that the Lord would not honour his Grace on any ſo vile, but that he would make the Offering more pleaſant to him friſt. And I ſaw, if I had never ſuch Expreſſions, yet if I had not Light and Life within whence they came, (1) It was a Sign the Spirit of Chriſt was far from me, (2) Far, hereupon, from God's People; which began to afflict my Heart. And hereupon I thought to lie down in Senſe of my Vileneſs, and condemn my ſelf and others for ſuch Hypocriſy, and wait for the Spirit, the Comforter which God is able to give &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Only I conſidered, that Sincerity of a Duty lies as much in Mortification, ſeeing the Evil of it, as Vivifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, doing it with Life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nov.</hi> 3. On a <hi>Faſt-Day</hi> at Night, in <hi>Preparation for the Duty,</hi> the Lord made me ſenſible of theſe Sins in the Churches; (1) Ignorance of themſelves, becauſe of ſecret Evils; (2) Ignorance of God, becauſe moſt Men were full of dark and doubtful Conſciences; (3) Not cleaving to Chriſt dearly, only; (4) Neglect of
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:006067_0163_102751F564D104B0"/>
Duties, becauſe of our Place of Security; (5) Standing againſt all Means, becauſe we grow not better; (6) Earthlineſs, becauſe we long not to be with Chriſt. And I ſaw Sin as my greateſt Evil; ***** I was vile, but God was good only, whom my Sins did croſs. And I ſaw what Cauſe I had to loath my ſelf, and not to ſeek Honour to my ſelf. Will any deſire his Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill to be commended? Will he be grieved if it be not? So my Heart began to fall off from ſeeking Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.—The Lord alſo gave me ſome Glimpſe of my ſelf: and a good Day and Time it was to me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Novemb.</hi> 4. On the End of the Faſt I (1) went to God, and reſted on him as <hi>ſufficient;</hi> (2) waited on him as <hi>efficient,</hi> and ſaid, <q>Now, Lord, do for thy Churches, and help in Mercy.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Beginning of this Day I began to conſider, whether all the Country did not fare the worſe for my Sins; and I ſaw it was ſo. And this was an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Thought to me: And I thought, if every one in particular did think ſo, and was humbled, it would do well.—I ſaw alſo that if Repentance turn away Judgments, then if the <hi>Queſtion</hi> be, who they are that bring Judgments? The <hi>Anſwer</hi> would be, They that think their Sins ſo ſmall, as that God is not angry with them at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1. When I was walking to <hi>Roxbury</hi> alone, I ſaw it was God alone who gave me a <hi>natural Life:</hi> And I turned the Thought into a Prayer, <q>Oh that I had a <hi>ſpiritual Life;</hi> that is but for a Time, this for ever.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Novemb.</hi> 7. On <hi>Sabbath,</hi> on my Bed after Sermon, I examin'd my Heart about <hi>this Queſtion,</hi> viz. <hi>In whoſe Name I had preached,</hi> and <hi>in whoſe Strength I had done this Work to Day?</hi> And I ſaw that five Things did ſtrengthen me, or which I went in the Strength of; (1) My natural Strength: My Body is pretty ſtrong; and hence I went upon the Strength of that; (2) The
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:006067_0164_102751B4CEAE8F68"/>
Strength and Power of external Neceſſity; the Work muſt be done, and hence I went upon this; (3) The Strength of external Encouragement; as Acceptance with others, and Favour from others; (4) The Strength of ſpiritual Affection ſome time, and received Grace; and hence I have ſought for it: (5) The Strength of Faith if ſelf, or reſting to my Hold of Chriſt, rather than on his Hold of me. And here I ſaw three Things; (1) That if I did thus, God would curſe me, becauſe now I made Fleſh my Arm, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.6. And this affected me. Grace if ſelf was but Fleſh in Reſpect of God: (2) Here I ſaw the common and great Sin of all Men in their Ways and Acts: They do truſt to themſelves, and ſtay in themſelves, and have ſome Bottom to ſtand upon beſide God, when they come to act: (3) I ſaw the admirable ſtrange Operation of Faith, that nullifies all Things, even it ſelf, that God may act. It's a Faith under, or ſtirring under Faith, that doth the Deed. A Chriſtian by it goes, not only out of himſelf; but out of his Faith: (4) Hence I ſaw, how near to God Faith made a Chriſtian; raiſing it above Man, out of Man, out of himſelf, to God: That the Deity doth as it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately act upon the Soul, when it is thus elevated and lift out of it ſelf.—Now here aroſe a Queſtion [1] <hi>What of God doth Faith raiſe it to?</hi> I ſaw it was (1) To God as <hi>ſufficient</hi> (1) In Father (2) In Son (3) In Holy Ghoſt; And there Faith ſtays: [2] To God as <hi>efficient.</hi> And on ſuch a God, and ſuch Strength of a God it ſtays. A [2d.] Queſtion was; <hi>Whether Faith reſts on the Lord's Efficiency immediately, or medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately?</hi> I anſwered both Ways. But (1) <hi>mediately</hi> (1) To God in a Command. For God's Commands give Strength. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1. (2) To God in a Promiſe: For a Promiſe gives Strength. (2) <hi>Immediately,</hi> to all that hidden, infinite Efficacy and Power it ſees in God, and believes to be there. For ſome time it ſees neither
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:006067_0165_102751F98CEFE3C0"/>
to reſt on: Now it looks to him, that he may look to it, and do for it abundantly—And beſide, there needs immediate, omnipotent Efficacy in God's Command and Promiſe: And hence it muſt reſt on this, elſe they are uſeleſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Novemb.</hi> 10. I kept <hi>a private Faſt</hi> for Light to ſee the Glory of God's Truth and Faith, an infuſed Faith, and a Spirit of Prayer, and for Conqueſt of Pride; and for Aſſiſtance and Aceptance and Guidance, (whether I ſhould ſet up Lecture again) and for Succeſs and Bleſſing in my poor Miniſtry, that ſo I might declare and manifeſt God's Name, and leave his Truth and ſo himſelf, and ſo his Mercy in the <hi>Country;</hi> As alſo for outward Supplies for <hi>the Country.</hi> And I ſaw no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Man could be comfortably provided for, but by ſome ſpecial Mercy to the <hi>Common State.</hi> And hence I ſaw God called for Prayer, not ſo much for our ſelves, as <hi>the Common.</hi> And I ſaw the common State of the Country did lie upon me and every one in particular, to ſeek God for, viz. That he would build up our Zion and proſper the Vine his own Hand hath planted; and that in this New World we might find the New Heavens and the New Earth; as alſo for Pardon.</p>
                  <p>Over Night I did queſtion, <hi>whether the Lord did call me to Him in ſuch a Day?</hi> And I ſaw, the Lord cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon Scorners to turn at Wiſdom's Reproof, and to dig for Wiſdom. And on the Morning betimes in Prayer, the Lord let me ſee, he called me unto him: "Come and ſeek and ſeek with all thy Heart." And this came freſh and clear to me, and did much affect my Heart, to think that the Lord ſhould call unto me, as he did call <hi>Abraham</hi> to follow him. And here I began to have ſome Light let in about <hi>effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual Calling;</hi> And I ſaw theſe Things about it: [1] I ſaw the firſt Act of Calling was by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God in his Word: [2] That it was by the Word of the Goſpel, or Command of the Goſpel,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:006067_0166_102751BACFF747C0"/>
"Come unto me, Return to me!" [3] I ſaw the Lord did this effectually; (1) By letting in a Light, clearly to ſee that he called me in particular, (2) By letting in the Goodneſs and Sweetneſs of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, as well as the Truth of it: [4] This Goodneſs and Sweetneſs of the Command I ſaw in two Things! (1) In Regard of the great Love of God in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, for a poor Sinner, thinking God cares not for it, and hence would not have it come to him, being ſo vile: O, the Command, which ſaith, Yet return, and ſeek, and come, is exceeding ſweet Love; (2) In Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the End of the Command, which was Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with himſelf, that he may be all and do all: This was ſweet: [5] I ſaw, this was not only by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, though firſtly, ſo, but nextly by his Promiſe: And this Promiſe I ſaw was not to be ſeen but in the Word: And I ſaw all Things promiſed to ſuch a one as comes. And hence I ſaw, I had no need of ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God's Election as I did begin to do in the Morning, whether he loves me, or no: For I ſaw (1) God the Father's Favour promiſed; <hi>"Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and I'll return to you!</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. (2) I ſaw Chriſt promiſed; for we are called to his Fellowſhip, and are bid to take him: <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.1, 2. (3) The Spirit promiſed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. <hi>Return,</hi> Scorners, <hi>and I'll pour out my Spirit on you</hi> (4) Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing all Sin and Puniſhments of Sin, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.22, 23. (5) Perſeverance promiſed, <hi>John</hi> 6.37. <hi>I'll in no wiſe caſt out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Beginning of the 2d Prayer I ſaw there was a God, for I ſaw Things had a Being; hence they muſt have this Being from themſelves, or ſomething elſe: But thoſe poor Creatures the Moon and Stars could not give Being to themſelves.</p>
                  <p>I ſaw alſo, <hi>how I had embraced the Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life, a long Time.</hi> And hence I ſaw it was not only juſt and righteous that
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:006067_0167_102751FB173FE398"/>
the Lord ſhould deny to hear my Prayers, but that it was Mercy he would do ſo: For what greater Judgment, than to pleaſe a Luſt, and leave me to it?</p>
                  <p>I ſaw alſo <hi>the Pride of my Heart in one Thing more, I ſaw not before;</hi> viz. in ſetting upon Preaching out of an Apprehenſion of the Excellency of what I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered above others, and that theſe Truths that came from me were choice and excellent and to be received with high Eſteem. For, were it not for ſuch a fooliſh Conceit, I ſhould think my Miniſtry leſs and worſe than any Man's elſe, and ſhould hang down my Head in a Hole and not lift it up to ſpeak; which did hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble me, and ſhew me my Vanity, and that my Duty was to be carried on, not by ſuch a Principle: But (1) Becauſe it was God's ſweet Truth I did deliver: (2) Becauſe it was God's Command I ſhould deliver it: (3) That it was for the ſake of the Lord and his Name, wherefore I did ſo. And here I ſaw the Lord begin as it were to refine me.</p>
                  <p>I concluded this Day [1] with ſome Meaſure of <hi>Faith;</hi> for after Prayer, I left all I pray'd for unto God's rich free Grace. And hence I ſaw (1) That the Lord did take Pleaſure in ſuch as hope in his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; (2) That whatſoever I, or any had pray'd for, God had promiſed, and therefore purpoſed to give; and thence I might quiet my Heart about God's ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Purpoſe: [2] With <hi>Reſolution;</hi> (1) Whatever God ſhould give me, to attribute it unto Grace; (2) To walk in a Way of Holineſs for the Future.</p>
                  <p>I ſaw alſo that <hi>my Heart was ready to think, I have prayed enough after ſuch a Day and ſuch Hopes.</hi> But I ſaw (1) That though God purpoſeth Mercy, yet he withal intendeth the Decree ſhall bring forth by Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: (2) He will therefore have us pray till the Thing be granted: (3) When the Decree hath begun to bring forth, I ſaw that all the Degrees of Mercy ariſe by ſeveral Degrees of Prayer: As when Faith is begun,
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:006067_0168_102751BDAC5FD918"/>
but 'tis imperfect, Prayer muſt be continued ſtill for all the reſt; as the chap'd Ground opens ſtill wider and wider, till Rain fall.</p>

                     <hi>Nov.</hi> 13. I was <hi>conſidering the State of the Country by Reaſon of its Poverty.</hi> I had two Arguments ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to make me hope the Lord would relieve us—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe, if the Lord had given himſelf for his People to redeem them from the greateſt Sin of the World; then from out of thoſe Sins by which our Diſtreſſes are occaſioned now: (2) Becauſe we are a poor afflicted People, caſt out of our own Country from our Friends and Comforts there; and all our Sorrows and Suffering here are in Part by Reaſon of their Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and Perſecution; and that therefore the Lord will deliver, if we ſought. O Lord, remember my Sighs!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nov.</hi> 13. I <hi>ſaw a little of God, and ſaw that it was my Duty to make him ſuperior, and ſet him up in his Highneſs above all others in my Mind and Eye:</hi> and I ſaw I had (1) Cauſe of Wondring at my Carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him, that he being ſo high, I ſhould neglect him; (2) I ſaw I had therefore ſinned againſt him, becauſe I had ſet up my Self, or Sin, or Men above the Lord: (3) I ſaw, that in this did appear one ſpecial Branch of the Evil of Sin, becauſe the Breach of God's Law did ever ariſe from the Contempt of the Lord's Perſon and Deſpiſing of him and his Glory, in preferring vile Things in Compariſon before him; and hence I ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Will: (4) I ſaw I had Reaſon to reſolve that as I had deſpiſed God and ſet up other Things and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them; ſo to deſpiſe my ſelf and the Preſence of all Men in compariſon of him: (5) The Lord made me that Night lie down and be humbled in my ſelf, and exalt the Lord with ſome Deſires.</p>

                     <hi>Now.</hi> 14. On the <hi>Sabbath Day</hi> at Night after Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>I ſaw I had preach'd to others, but had not feed my ſelf.</hi> And I ſeeing it did ariſe from Weakneſs of
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:006067_0169_102751FE43BD1F70"/>
Faith and Light, the Lord ſuggeſted the 103 <hi>Pſalm</hi> to me—<hi>He heals all thine Infirmities,</hi> which quiet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>Nov.</hi> 15. On my Bed in the Morning I tried my Heart, and aſked, What would bear it out, if the Lord ſhould call me to preach at the Lecture Seaſon again? And I found three Things; (1) My End was to honour Chriſt Jeſus, and leave his Truth behind me: (2) My Principle was Chriſt, in whom I truſted: For this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted me againſt the Feeling of my Inability; I ſaw there was an unknown Fulneſs of the Spirit and Strength in Chriſt, and that I was not to go out in the Strength of my own Abilities though received from Chriſt, but in the Strength and Help of Chriſt himſelf: (3) Though what I ſhould do thus from Chriſt, for Chriſt, was mean and poor; yet it ſhould quiet me that it was the Meaſure the Lord ſaw moſt meet for me, and if I could do better, I would: (4) That if the Lord did not give Succeſs to me, yet I would mourn for God's People and my own Unworthineſs, and quiet my ſelf, that I did my Duty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nov.</hi> 16. I <hi>felt my Heart very unſavoury, and I ſaw my Soul nothing but Sin and Sorrow, Death and Darkneſs,</hi> and in a Manner, as good as in Hell. And ſo I ſaw then, that nothing but free Grace could help me out; and there I did hang, and did prize this Grace therefore. But I did queſtion, It may reſuſe to help becauſe 'tis free. But I ſaw it is the Pleaſure of God's Grace to help all that pray'd for it and came for it to Grace. And I ſaw herein was Part of God's good Pleaſure, to hear every Prayer, and I ſhould look upon no other Secrets but this revealed Will of Chriſt: And ſo I purpoſed ever to lie here. And I ſaw, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon Grace for all, ever ſuppoſeth a deep Abaſement of Soul under a Senſe of Unworthineſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Novemb.</hi> 18. As I was going down my Stairs, I thought, If <hi>Paul</hi> did ſo deſire the Good of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi>
                     <pb n="65" facs="unknown:006067_0170_102751C08508A2A0"/>
his Country Men, his Enemies, that oppoſed him, that he could wiſh himſelf <hi>Anathema</hi> for them; much more ſhould I earneſtly deſire the Good of their Souls, who had under God committed themſelves to my Care and Charge. And ſo I left them to God's free Grace to provide for them. And at Night I had Doubts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Lord would regard them, or no, though I did reſign them up to him. But it came to my Mind, that if God was an Idol God, then I might give them to him in vain; but it was not ſo. And hence I had very ſweet Perſwaſion that Night, that my Work herein was not deſpiſed of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Novemb.</hi> 21. On <hi>Sabbath Day</hi> after Preaching, <hi>I conſidered my Vileneſs,</hi> that I did not ſee Things by the Lord's Light, nor was perſwaded by the Lord's Faith, not quickned nor ſtrengthened by the Lord's Life and Strength. So I demanded a Reaſon, why the Lord Jeſus did not only, not outwardly help, but not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly act? I ſaw the Lord was not in me, hence did not work in me. I aſked then, Why he was not in me? I ſaw my Sin had ſeparated him from me: Yet I ſaw no Sin could ſeparate if Unbelief was not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. If I returned by Faith, he would return to me. Then being ready to come, and yet ſeeing God's Grace only could draw me; I demanded, Whether I ſhould put this Honour on God's Grace to draw me, or take it to my ſelf, in coming by my own Strength? So I left my Soul with God's free Grace. Yet I ſaw that though Chriſt did not act in me in the ſame Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as in <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſaid <hi>Chriſt did live in him:</hi> yet I ſaw he did act in ſome Meaſure, though little: (1) Becauſe I did deſire the Lord to act all (2) Becauſe I mourned for want of this, and loathed my ſelf for what I did: (3) Becauſe I did rejoice if the Lord would act me. And the next Morning I ſaw the Truth of this in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Example, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. by <hi>the Thorn in the Fleſh,</hi> to whom the Lord ſaid, <hi>My Grace,</hi> in pardoning,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:006067_0171_102752011F948C88"/>
accepting, <hi>is ſufficient for thee,</hi> without thy Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and holy Affections.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Novemb.</hi> 22. I ſaw the Lord, and <hi>by Faith did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend Chriſt's Righteouſneſs;</hi> and did ſee that I was to make Uſe of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs apprehended by Faith, not only for Satisfaction to Juſtice, but alſo to take it as an Evidence, unſpotted, of the Lord's Love towards me, to beget Peace in me. I ſaw I had a long Time made uſe of it for <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> but not for <hi>Evidence,</hi> and ſo for <hi>Peace.</hi> For I ſaw when I had done, and the Lord had enabled me to do this and do that, then my Conſcience was at Peace, and got Peace in that? But when I wanted that, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended Chriſt's Righteouſneſs by Faith, all that which he hath done perfectly, I did not there find Peace to my Conſcience, as having an Evidence of the Lord's Favour and Acceptance. Whenas I ſaw that if any Thing I did by the Help of the Spirit might give me Evidence; then much more all that which Chriſt did, and had done perfectly ought to give me Peace, and be an Evidence, not only of God's Favour to me, but of that Grace I want; (the want of which made me doubt of the Lord's Love) becauſe all that Faith and Holineſs in Chriſt is by Faith made mine; and it is as if I had done it. For I ſaw, if I had perfect Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in me, I ſhould not doubt of the Lord's Love to me; Why now, when I ſee I have it in Chriſt by Faith? So I ſaw <hi>a threefold Uſe of Faith in Chriſt's Righteouſneſs:</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. For Satisfaction to Divine Juſtice, and making me righteous;</item>
                        <item>2. For Evidence of God's Favour to me;</item>
                        <item>3. For the Honour of God, becauſe by that I honour God infinitely.</item>

                     <hi>Novemb.</hi> 24. I felt over Night <hi>much Darkneſs and Unbelief;</hi> and ſaw, that if Satan had once made us begin to doubt, he would hold us with Doubts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:006067_0172_102751C4AAB78C00"/>
about the Being of God and Truth of the Scriptures. And I ſaw the next Morning this Error; viz. That I did believe what the Lord ſpake, becauſe I ſaw it agreeable to my Reaſon, and ſo made that my laſt Reſolution of all Doubts. And I began to think, how it ſhould be otherwiſe? So I ſaw I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to ſee the Things God ſpake, in the Reality of them, and in their Agreement with Reaſon, but not to make this the laſt Reſolution of Doubts, though a Reſolution. But then, when I had ſeen Things ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to Reaſon, yet to look upon <hi>God's Teſtimony of them in Scripture</hi> as the laſt and chief Light and Ground of Settlement; and not to believe theſe Things are true, becauſe I ſee they are true, but to believe, the Lord ſees them more clearly than I: and he knowing them to be ſo, I ſee them ſo, and believe them upon his Teſtimony, much more: For if I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any Thing to be true, becauſe I ſee it ſo; much more becauſe God ſaith it, who ſees it better, and whoſe Word ſtakes me down, and confirms me in it.</p>

                  <p>(1) By withdrawing the Spirit of Light, to give me a greater Meaſure of it than ever I have had before; to give me a greater Fulneſs by praying for more; (2) To humble me for my Confidence in my Light and Knowledge paſt; and in ſpeaking ſo much with ſo little Light, who knew ſo little; (3) To heal this Wound of ſecret Atheiſm and Unbelief, which was but ſkin'd over before. I ſaw all this was infinite Love and Mercy: Yet I ſaw this Condition was a deep and deadly Miſery; and I ſaw, I ſhould be vile indeed, if I did not mourn bitterly under it: For if I was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the Miſery of Affliction, the Lord would be diſpleaſed and count himſelf neglected, if I did not cry;
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:006067_0173_10275205943BD710"/>
much more if I ſhould not cry under the Power of my Sins.—This was on <hi>Saturday Night.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I alſo ſaw <hi>a vaſt Difference between knowing Things</hi> by <hi>Reaſon and Diſcourſe,</hi> and by <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>the Spirit of Faith.</hi> For by Diſcourſe, (1) I ſaw that a Thing was ſo. A Man's Diſcourſe about ſpiritual Things is like a Philoſopher's Diſcourſe about the inward Forms of Things, which they ſee not, yet ſee that they be; but by the Light of the Spirit of Faith I ſee the Thing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, as it is. I have ſeen a God by Reaſon, and never been amazed at God thus apprehended; But I have ſeen God himſelf, and been raviſhed to behold him. And here I ſaw, what the Meaning of Chriſt's Speech is <hi>John.</hi> 14. <hi>The World knows not the Spirit,</hi> and hence <hi>cannot receive him;</hi> viz. That 'tis ſuch a Spirit, as gives ſuch Glimpſes of God's Glory, and of Chriſt, as though it departs, yet they know it ſo good, as that they long for it again, becauſe they know it. And here I ſaw the Meaning of that in <hi>Job, There is a Spirit in Man,</hi> that is, Reaſon; <hi>but the Inſpiration of the Almighty gives Underſtanding,</hi> that is, this Spirit of Faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Decemb.</hi> 9. On <hi>Thurſday Morning</hi> in my Bed, after my <hi>Wedneſday's Sermon,</hi> (1) <hi>I ſaw the Pride of my Heart acting thus;</hi> That when I had done publick Work, my Heart would preſently look out and enquire wherein I had done well or ill. And I ſaw, I rejoiced in that as well done, which pleaſed Man; and that as done amiſs, which might not be ſo glorious in the Eyes of Man. Hereupon I ſaw my Vileneſs, to make Men's Opinions my Rule; but then I ſaw <hi>my Rule to be this,</hi> viz. To ſee what good I had done, and give the Lord the Glory; and to conſider, what Sin I had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and to mourn for that. (2) <hi>Here I ſaw a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt;</hi> viz. To preach and pray, to ſtir up ſpiritual Affections, becauſe I ſaw it did beget Commendations; hence preach'd Terror and Comfort (though falſe) to beget Affection. I ſaw alſo, upon Enlargements, I
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:006067_0174_102751C7D534A278"/>
was apt to be ſomewhat in mine own Eyes, whereas <hi>my Rule is,</hi> to be more vile than any Man in my own Eyes, and that daily.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Decemb.</hi> 10. I <hi>began to be troubled for my Sin of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:</hi> but I ſaw my Heart did work thus; (1) It was troubled for the Shame and Horror of Sin; (2) purpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; (3) went to Chriſt for Strength that I might do ſo no more, and ſo was quieted. Whereas I ſaw it was my Duty, (1) To get my Soul deeply loaden with the Sin, as Sin; (2) To come unto Chriſt, and get his Blood to give me Peace unſpeakable. Now in muſing on this, I ſaw how little Repentance there was in the World, and how many Sins I had ſtill to repent of. For I ſaw that moſt Men had their Peace after Sin, either by Forgetfulneſs of it wholly, and ſo had their Sorrows now and then; or elſe they did but ſkin over their Wound with ſome general Hope of Mercy and Grace, without ſweet Peace in Chriſt's Blood. And hence my Heart was very glad for this Light, in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this general Wound.</p>
                  <p>I ſaw here alſo <hi>the Reaſon why Men given to Paſſion are ſo frequently overcome by it;</hi> becauſe of all other Sins they have many ſecret Excuſes and Extenuations for it; as the Suddenneſs of it, and 'tis that I delight not in, and my Heart is ſad for it afterward, and godly Men may fall into it.</p>
                  <p>I ſaw alſo, there was all <hi>Reaſon why I ſhould cleave to the Lord:</hi> 1. Becauſe all my Good was from him in Times of Peace: 2. Becauſe he was my only Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port in Time of Trouble: 3. He alone was ſufficient, when after Life all Troubles ſhould end: 4. I began to ſee, how good his Will was in all, and that even when it croſſed me, I ſhould be pleaſed with it.</p>
                  <p>I alſo <hi>began to feel God in Fire, Meat, every Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi> and that God's many Providences and Creatures are but his Hands and Fingers, whereby he takes Hold of me &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="unknown:006067_0175_102752071D8094F0"/>
                     <hi>Decemb.</hi> 11. On <hi>Saturday</hi> at <hi>Night,</hi> I was <hi>ſtirr'd up to pray for the Spirit:</hi> Not only for particular Graces of it, but for the Spirit it ſelf. <hi>The Ground of this my Prayer was;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1) Becauſe I felt an Abſence of the Spirit exceeding much. I found I was ſenſual and carnal, and carried and acted by my own Spirit in every Thing, However I felt a little of God's Spirit ſmoaking forth in ſome weak Deſires after it; I felt not the Power of it, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as <hi>Paul</hi> did <hi>bound by</hi> it, <hi>led with</hi> it. <hi>Acts</hi> 1. <hi>Power from on high:</hi> (2) Becauſe I ſaw this the next and ſureſt Way to have all the Graces of the Spirit; to have all the Impreſſions of this Seal, by having the Seal it ſelf. Whereas, if I wrought for one particular Grace without this, it was far about: (3) Becauſe the Spirit can heal, help, quicken, humble, ſuddenly, and eaſily; Whereas otherwiſe I may be long before I can ſee: (4) Becauſe it works Grace and Life effectually. My own Spirit, and Light, and Affection may deceive me when they act; but this cannot: (5) Becauſe it works Grace eternally, as it ſelf is eternal.</p>
                  <p>I alſo here ſaw <hi>two great Hindrances</hi> for me in getting this Spirit: (1) I contented my ſelf with a little Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of it, and ſo ſet down: (2) I thought God would not give more, and hence I ought to reſt without ſeeking after more.</p>
                  <p>Here alſo fell in <hi>two Queſtions.</hi> [1] <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whether, when a Chriſtian feels a Want of the Light of Life and Faith of the Spirit; he ſhould only humble himſelf for the Want of them, and do nothing in way of Meditation and ſtirring up his Heart to ſee and do, or ſtir up that Ability he had to ſee and live and do? For I ſaw this, that when a Man finds a Loſs of God, either he is wholly in the Dark and cannot ſee him; or elſe Satan and his own natural Abilities will be working and caſting in Light, that ſo a Man might be contented with that and ſeek no farther for the Spirit of Light, nor feel
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:006067_0176_102751C95E6B4310"/>
ſuch a Need of it: Satan and Nature by their Work will prevent the Lord's.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this I ſaw (1) that the Scripture bids me meditate and uſe all Means for the Spirit, and therefore not to confine my ſelf to that one Means only, of being humbled for the Want of the Spirit: (2) That the <hi>Rule here is;</hi> We muſt uſe all Means, but truſt to the Spirit to give a Bleſſing by them, depend only, and wait only for the Light of God in the Uſe of Means.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whether it was a Duty, or an Error, to pray and look for the Fulneſs of the Spirit in me, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out coming by Faith out of my ſelf, and ſo finding and feeling the Fulneſs of the Spirit out of me in Chriſt? And whether I might not be miſtaken, and think I was empty of the Spirit, becauſe I did not feel it in me, when haply of the Time when I am moſt empty, I might be moſt full, by Faith in Chriſt? And whether the Fulneſs of the Spirit in the Apoſtles was not chiefly a Power of the Spirit, giving them a Subſiſtence out of themſelves in Chriſt, in whom their Life and Joy was; ſeeing that <hi>Paul</hi> oft complains of his Sin and Inſufficiency and Ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to think or ſpeak?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here I ſaw theſe Things; (1) That Chriſt had all Fulneſs, and ſo all Fulneſs of the Spirit: (2) That all that Fulneſs which I did want in my ſelf was in Chriſt, for his People, not for himſelf. He had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Knowledge and Grace and Righteouſneſs; not only that by it he might vertually make me ſee and be righteous; but that it might be mine: (3) I ſaw it my Duty therefore, out of Senſe of my Emptineſs, to go unto Chriſt and poſſeſs and enjoy all that Fulneſs that is in him, as mine own; and to be as much filled with that, and to rejoice as much in that, as if I had it in my ſelf, becauſe it is for me in Chriſt, and my own there: (4) I ſaw when I did thus, then I was full of the Spirit: and that I was now as a Fiſh that is got from the Shore to the Sea, where it hath all Fulneſs
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:006067_0177_1027520D1634C8B0"/>
of Waters to move in: And ſo I ſaw, <hi>Faith did</hi> firſt fill me, and <hi>ſhould</hi> firſt fill me: When I was moſt empty, then by Faith I was moſt full: (5) I ſaw this was the Way to be filled with the Spirit, to my feeling within me. <hi>Stephen</hi> was full of Faith, and then of the Holy Ghoſt: (1) Becauſe this made me moſt empty, and ſo moſt fit for the Spirit to work in: (2) Becauſe this Finding of the Treaſure of all Grace in this Field of Chriſt did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get Strength, Joy, Glory, and ſo made Graces alive: (3) Becauſe I ſhould glory more in what I receive from Chriſt, than in that Fulneſs which is in Chriſt, the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all his Glory and my Good and Glory, if I ſhould firſt receive the Spirit from him, without finding, and filling and drinking in of that Spirit which is in him: (6) I ſaw a Need for the Lord to this End to do two Things; (1) To ſtabliſh me in Chriſt, and ſettle me there, and give me a Being there; (2) To give me a Certainty, that all this was mine; for I ſaw, this only would fill my Heart and Soul.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Concluſion of all</hi> was, I was reſolved to pray for the Spirit, and not to give the Lord over for it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dec.</hi> 18. I ſaw it my Duty ſo to lament my Sin, as that my Sorrow ſhould ſwallow up all the Joy I took in any Thing in this World. And here I remembred what it was to afflict one's Soul; viz. To make Sin as bitter as Affliction, and to make it my Affliction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dec.</hi> 20. I ſaw my Evil, (1) That I had much ado to ſee my Sin; (2) But much more difficult was it to mourn for it, as my Death, and to be in Travail with it, and in Pangs and Sorrows for it, that I might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered out of it.</p>
                  <p>I ſaw alſo on the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> viz. the Day before, <hi>Dec.</hi> 20, How my Heart gathered Evil in every Place, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57. And it gathered, either, (1) Carnal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, or (2) Diſcontent, by ſtriking upon external Objects.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dec.</hi> 21. I ſaw that Man was an infinite kind of Evil,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:006067_0178_102751D059879948"/>
when he is croſs'd; as in Hell, there he blaſphemes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe croſs'd. And hence Men's Sins lie hid, becauſe not croſs'd.</p>
                  <p>I ſaw alſo the Deceit of Man's Heart; which when it is very bad, then it begins to ſeek to be very good; if it have and feel any Good, it grows full and lifted up and looſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dec.</hi> 27. God humbled me in ſome Meaſure, (1) Making me ſee, how I deſerved Death, and nothing but eternal Death; and that it belonged to me as my Due, which made me wonder I had any Mercy; (2) Making me deſirous to feel Sin the greateſt Evil, and to prize deliverance from it, as out of Hell.</p>
                  <p>I ſaw alſo, (1) How miſerable I was, If I had no Favour; (2) How precious his Favour was; (3) How exceeding precious Chriſt was, by whom I came to have all Favour; and how precious his Blood was, ſo as I deſired to rejoice in nothing, but in Chriſt.</p>
