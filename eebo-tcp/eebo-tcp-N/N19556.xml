            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TRIAL OF LOUIS XVI.</head>
            <p>ON the 11th of December, 1792, about one o'clock, the mayor and ſecretary went up into the apartment of the late king, and ſaid to him, "I am charged to declare to you, that the Convention wait for you at their bar, and I am appointed to conduct you." The ſecretary then read theſe words, "Decree of the National Convention, of the 6th of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember: Art. 5. Louis Capet ſhall be brought to the bar of the National Convention on Tueſday the 11th, to anſwer the queſtions which ſhall be put to him by the preſident." This being done, the mayor aſked him if he would go down, he appeared to heſitate a little, and ſaid, "My name is not Louis Capet; my anceſtors bore that name, but I never was called ſo; it is however like all the treatment I have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced theſe four months paſt by force. This morning my ſon has been ſeparated from me; it was an enjoyment of which they have deprived me. I have been expecting you theſe three hours</p>
            <p>The mayor, without making any anſwer, invited him again to go down, which he determined at length to do. Being in the carriage, which was lined with thick cuſhions, in order to be muſket proof, he kept ſilence all the way, till the carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was ſtopped by ſome miſunderſtanding among the guards who eſcorted him on the Boulevards.</p>
            <p>He arrived at the Convention about two o'clock. He did not ſeem at all troubled. The mayor and attorney-general were on each ſide of him; behind him were Santerre, Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruyer and other officers.</p>
            <p>The ſitting of the Convention commenced by reading the act of accuſation againſt Louis XVI, which was preſented by Barbaroux in the name of the commiſſion of twenty one. It contained an enumeration of the principal charges made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the unfortunate monarch; and each charge was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by a liſt of the pieces on which the proofs are to be founded. When it was read, ſeveral new charges were
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:025499_0004_0FCDEC04DE8DFDB0"/>
propoſed by ſeveral of the members, and ſome which appeared to have little weight, or to be ill founded, were expunged.</p>
            <p>The famous Marat voluntarily became the defender of Louis, by requeſting that all thoſe charges alluding to crimes committed before his acceptance of the conſtitution, ſhould be omitted in the act of accuſation. He ſpoke alſo of the amneſty which followed the acceptance, but the Convention paid no attention to his obſervations.</p>
            <p>The Convention decreed, that the act of accuſation ſhould ſerve as the ground of thoſe queſtions which were to be put to the king, and that after each queſtion the preſident ſhould ſay to him, <hi>What have you to anſwer?</hi> The preſident was alſo authoriſed to propoſe ſuch queſtions as might ariſe from the king's anſwers, and to make him ſit down at the bar.</p>
            <p>Barrere, the preſident, informed the Convention that Louis was at the door, and requeſted the repreſentatives of the people to aſſume a dignity worthy of the grandeur of their functions. He reminded them, that they formed a tribunal on which the eyes of Europe were fixed, and whoſe ſentence would be judged by poſterity. He forbade them to ſhow any ſigns either of approbation or diſapprobation, and deſired them to remember the coolneſs and ſilent dignity with which they received the king after his return from Varennes.</p>
            <p>At half paſt two Santerre informed the Convention that Louis was arrived, and was waiting the orders of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly.</p>
            <p>The preſident gave the order to introduce him. A moſt profound ſilence reigned in the hall. Louis appeared at the bar, attended by two municipal officers.</p>
            <p>When Louis appeared at the bar, the preſident mentioned to him the decree by which the Convention eſtabliſhed a tribunal to try him. Maillie, one of the ſecretaries, read the act of accuſation, charge by charge, and at each the preſident aſked the king what he had to ſay in his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Louis contented himſelf with giving anſwers to each queſtion in a few words, he made no ſpeech, and did not, like Charles J. of England, deny the authority of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention to try him. He aſked for copies of the act of accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, of the pieces which are to ſerve as proofs, and of his
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:025499_0005_0FCDEC061130F0A0"/>

               <p>The preſident told him that the aſſembly permitted him to retire.</p>
               <p>Louis, on retiring, ſaid, I have deſired to have a counſel.</p>
               <p>The aſſembly then decreed, that the deſire of Louis to have a counſel ſhould be granted.</p>
               <p>After his interrogatory he was conducted into the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence-Hall, and accepted a bit of bread, obſerving that he had not broken his faſt. He was then conducted home in the ſame manner he had been taken to the Convention, and arrived at his apartment at half paſt ſix.</p>
               <p>On the 26th of the ſame month, the preſident informed the Convention that Louis and his defenders were ready to appear at the bar, and gave orders for their admiſſion.</p>

               <p>Citizens, repreſentatives of the nation:</p>
               <p>THE moment is at length arrived, in which Louis, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed in the name of the French nation, and ſurrounded by the counſel which humanity and the laws have granted him, is about to preſent his juſtification. Even by the ſilence which ſurrounds me, I am informed that the day of juſtice has ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the aera of prejudice.</p>
               <p>The misfortunes of kings are ſomewhat more tenderly impreſſive, and more ſacred, than the misfortunes of other men; even he, who but lately filled the moſt brilliant throne in the univerſe, muſt excite a more powerful intereſt. You have called him among you; he is come, calmly, with dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, ſtrong in his innocence, ſupported by the teſtimony of his whole life. He has revealed to you even his thoughts,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:025499_0009_0FCDEC0F134A2028"/>
in diſcuſſing, without preparation, without examination, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations which he could not foreſee, making, if I may ſo ſay, an extempore defence.</p>
               <p>Louis could only ſay that he was innocent; I come to prove it to you, I bring the demonſtrations. I could wiſh this ſpace were ſo enlarged that the multitude of citizens, who have received the moſt baneful impreſſions to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of Louis, ſhould now feel thoſe of a different tendency. Louis knows that Europe expects with anxiety the ſentence you are now to paſs. He knows that poſterity will ſome day examine it;—he knows it, but he conſiders only his cotemporaries. With him we forget poſterity, and view only the preſent moment.</p>
               <p>Had I judges only to anſwer, I would content myſelf with ſaying, that ſince the nation has aboliſhed royalty, there can be no ſentence to pronounce againſt Louis; but I ſpeak to the people. I have to examine the affair under two points of view, that in which Louis was placed before his accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and that in which he ſtands ſince his acceptance of the conſtitution.</p>
               <p>In entering on this buſineſs, I firſt meet with the decree which pronounces that Louis ſhall be tried by the conſtitution. Apparently the legiſlators, ſaid Louis, cannot bring forward this inviolability. What then have you done by your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree? you have conſtituted yourſelves <hi>judges</hi> of the accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which you make yourſelves.</p>
               <p>You have decreed, that Louis ſhall be heard. If then he ought to be heard, he has the right to defend himſelf. It does not depend on the judge to circumſcribe the means<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the convention ſhall weigh them when he ſhall have brought them forward. If Louis be miſtaken, let them refute his errors.</p>
               <p>Nations are ſovereign: they are free to give themſelves ſuch forms of government as they pleaſe. I will not diſpute this principle; and it is not forgotten that the efforts of one of the advocates of Louis contributed to inſert this principle in the conſtitution. But the nation cannot itſelf exerciſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty, it is neceſſary the exerciſe of it ſhould be dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated.</p>
               <p>In 1789 the nation deſired a monarchial government; a monarchial government required the inviolability of its chief;
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:025499_0010_0FCDEC12ADFA2828"/>
it was neceſſary that he ſhould impreſs that reſpect which renders amiable the obedience that the law commands. The character of this inviolability has been diſcuſſed, it has been pretended that it was not a contract of reciprocity, but this delegation was a contract ſo long as it was not revoked. It is a mandate if you pleaſe, but the mandatory could not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to other conditions and other penalties than thoſe impoſed in the mandate.</p>
               <p>I open the conſtitution at Chapter II. <hi>of royalty,</hi> and I ſee that the perſon of the king is inviolable; there is no excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no modification, but there are circumſtances in which we loſe the character of inviolability.</p>
               <p>This is the firſt caſe.</p>
               <p>Art. V. of Section I. Chap. 2. of Title 3. "If the king have not made oath, or if, after having made it, he retract it, he ſhall be conſidered as having abdicated royalty."</p>
               <p>The nation here impoſes on the king the duty of taking an oath: to retract his oath is a crime againſt the nation. The nation has foreſeen this crime, and has enacted its penalty; it is not a dethronement—the word is not pronounced once, it is only a ſuppoſition, that the king ſhall be preſumed to have abdicated royalty. You ſee that the conſtitution cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates no tribunal, that it does not ſpeak of trial, and that it mentions no word of dethronement.</p>
               <p>But without retracting his oath, he could betray it; he might favour hoſtile and criminal enterpriſes againſt the ſtate —the conſtitution has again foreſeen this caſe.</p>
               <p>Art. VI. "If the king put himſelf at the head of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and direct its force againſt the nation; or if he do not oppoſe, by a formal act, any ſuch enterprize, which may be executed in his name, he ſhall be conſidered as having abdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated royalty."</p>
               <p>I deſire that you will weigh well the character of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> provided againſt by this article. There cannot exiſt one more criminal. It ſuppoſes all the machinations, all the perfidies, all the treaſons, every horror, every ſcourge, every calamity of a bloody and inteſtine war, and yet what does the conſtitution pronounce? The preſumption of having ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated royalty.</p>
               <p>Art. VII. "If the king, being gone out of the kingdom,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:025499_0011_0FCDEC145320E960"/>
does not return after the invitation made to him by the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative body."</p>
               <p>What does the conſtitution pronuunce again? The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of his having abdicated royalty.</p>
               <p>Article VIII. ſays, "that after the expreſs or legal abdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, the king ſhall be tried as other citizens for all crimes committed poſterior to his abdication." It reſults then that the king had a particular exiſtence abſolutely different from that of other citizens; and from whence did he derive this particular privileged exiſtence, if not from the law, which had impreſſed upon him the character of inviolability, which he could not loſe, but by his expreſs and legal abdication. And it is from the moſt attrocious crime that a king can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit againſt a nation, that it ſuppoſes him returned to the citizens. In other reſpects the law is perfectly equal between the legiſlative body and the king:—the legiſlative body might alſo betray the nation, it might ſeize the national ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty; the nation had a right to pronounce a penalty againſt the deputies, and yet none has been pronounced.</p>
               <p>Louis is accuſed, he is accuſed in the name of the nation, he is accuſed of various crimes. But theſe crimes are provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for by the conſtitutional act, and then the penalty ought to be applied—or they are not, and then there exiſts no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty applicable to them.</p>
               <p>I go farther, I ſay that they are provided againſt, the conſtitution has foreſeen the moſt atrocious of them all, that of a criminal war againſt the nation. In whatever manner this article may be underſtood, the crimes are there, they are there.—Well! the law declares only a preſumption of the abdication of royalty. I well know, that now the nation has aboliſhed kingly power, the penalty can be no longer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied—but could it change the fate of Louis? Has he not the right to ſay, "when the conſtitution was accepted, I was the priſoner of the nation, why did you not try me? You have aboliſhed royalty, I do not conteſt your right. But becauſe you have aboliſhed royalty, will you puniſh me, and becauſe you know no law you can apply to me, will you create one for the purpoſe—for me alone? You have all the powers, doubtleſſly: but one power you have not, that of being unjuſt.</p>
               <p>It has been ſaid that Louis was: be tried as an enemy.
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:025499_0012_0FCDEC15D0B6C730"/>
But is he not a cruel enemy who would put himſelf at the head of an army againſt the nation.</p>
               <p>It has been ſaid he was only inviolable for individual citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens. According to this principle, the repreſentatives of the people would no longer be inviolable to the people for every thing they have done, ſaid, or written, during their ſeſſion? I read in Rouſſeau—<hi>"Where I ſee neither the law which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutes, nor the law which condemns, I will not appeal to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral will, for the general will cannot pronounce, as a general will, on any man, nor on any facts."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you deprive Louis of the right of inviolability as a king, you cannot deprive him of the right of trial as a citizen. And in the laſt caſe, I demand of you where are all the forms of preſervation? Where are the juries, thoſe hoſtages for the lives and honour of citizens? I demand where is the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuffrages which the law has ſo wiſely eſtabliſhed? Where is the ſilent ballot, which incloſes in the ſame urn the opinion and the conſcience of the judge? I ſpeak to you with the plainneſs of a freeman. I look among you for jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, I ſee none but accuſers. You will pronounce upon Louis, and you have accuſed him! You will pronounce upon Louis, and you have declared your wiſh reſpecting him! You will pronounce upon Louis, and your opinions are ſpread over Europe!</p>
               <p>I ſhall here take the act of accuſation—I obſerve you go back to the 20th of July, 1789. I go back alſo. But how could you accuſe him of having wiſhed at this aera to diſſolve the aſſembly. Do you forget, that it was he who convened it? Do you forget, that for more than 150 years, princes, more zealous than him of their authority, had conſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted their convocation? Do you forget, that without him, without the numerous ſacrifices to which he conſented, you would not be deliberating here this day on the intereſts of the ſtate? He is reproached with having drawn troops round Paris, but I could ſay that theſe troops were intended for the protection of Paris againſt diſturbers. I had occaſion to ſee the order when I was employed to defend the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant of theſe troops, whom the nation did not heſitate to acquit.</p>
               <p>I will not ſpeak here of the memorial in which Talon is mentioned as acting a part againſt the revolution, nor the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:025499_0013_0FCDEC17530AD8F0"/>
papers annexed to this memorial. If I had to defend an ordinary client, I would ſay, that a citizen can never be tried upon papers found by the invaſion of his houſe, without being previouſly inventoried or ſealed.</p>
               <p>The houſe of Louis was invaded, his cheſts broken, his drawers forced; no ſeal was put on his effects, and invento<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries made; his papers may have been ſcattered, and thoſe loſt which ſhould reply to what were brought againſt him.</p>
               <p>The letters of a dead man are quoted, but are the letters of a perſon deceaſed proof? It is ſaid that theſe letters ſpeak of money diſtributed: but if this fact, which they do not explain, be true, ſhould it be true that they have extorted from his ſenſibility, from his benificence, ſums greater or leſs, is it not well known with what an unfortunate facility kings are circumvented and deceived. The copy of a letter to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabeau and La Fayette is ſpoken of, but the letter is not ſent. Mirabeau and La Fayette were at the ſame time, the moſt popular men, they both loved the conſtitution; in this ſcheme the good of the ſtate was the only aim.</p>
               <p>He was reproached for his letter to Bouille; here there is not even occaſion for him to juſtify himſelf—the National Aſſembly had voted thanks for the conduct of Bouille.</p>
               <p>You have reproached him with the aſſemblies of people on the 28th February, but popular rumours had drawn to the palace men of warm tempers, and Louis had ordered them to quit their arms.</p>
               <p>You have accuſed him of the maſſacres at the Champ de Mars; but do you then forget that the unhappy prince was ſuſpended from his powers, a priſoner guarded in ſight.</p>
               <p>The nation has decreed a republic, but this was not the form of government the nation then wiſhed. Did not the legiſlative aſſembly itſelf declare againſt the republic in the month of July laſt? If Louis had then betrayed the intereſts of the nation, or abuſed its confidence, you might complain— you might ſigh over the lot of kings, but you could not try him.</p>
               <p>I have not yet pronounced the word which muſt annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late all this chain of accuſation. I have not ſaid, that ſince all theſe events Louis has accepted the conſtitution.—The conſtitution was the compact between the people and the king —all miſts were then diſpelled—the paſt was forgot.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:025499_0014_0FCDE8F64BE12EF8"/>Let us examine what he has done ſince this acceptance.</p>
               <p>The act of accuſation comprehends both the facts which he was not charged to anſwer perſonally, and the facts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal to him. The conſtitution had not required on the part the king a warranty for his agents. It had, on the other hand ordained the reſponſibility of miniſters. No one has a right at preſent to accuſe the king and his miniſters of the ſame acts.</p>
               <p>Louis had been accuſed of having ſuffered the National Aſſembly to remain ignorant of the convention of Pilnitz. But this convention was a ſecret treaty between the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and the king of Pruſſia.</p>
               <p>There was no reaſon of ſtate which could render it a law to miniſters to make known to an aſſembly, whoſe delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are public, an act which was not ſo.</p>
               <p>You have reproached the unfortunate prince with having retarded a month the ſending a decree relative to Avignon; this, citizens, was one of the heads of accuſation againſt the miniſter Deliſſart. He had himſelf announced that his juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, which he was preparing in priſon, would leave no doubt of his innocence. And could you, after his death bring the ſame accuſation againſt the king?</p>
               <p>You have reproached him with the troubles of Niſmes, of Jales. Is it then for the king to be anſwerable for all the commotions inſeparable from ſo great a revolution?</p>
               <p>A letter of Witgenſtein has been conſtituted a crime; all that he could do, was to give him no place after his recall. The government of Corſica has been ſpoken of, but he never had it. It has been ſaid he had a commiſſion in the northern army, it is impoſſible that La Fayette had demanded it, but the letter which gave him the commiſſion remained in the war-office.</p>
               <p>He has been reproached with the account drawn up by Narbonne. I will anſwer with one word only—when Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne quitted the miniſtry, the legiſlative aſſembly decreed that Narbonne took with him the regret and confidence of the nation.</p>
               <p>He has been reproached with the ſurrender of Longwy— the inhabitants were guilty. The ſurrender of Verdun— Who then was it that appointed the celebrated commander<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who choſe rather to die than ſurrender, if it were not Louis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="unknown:025499_0015_0FCDEC1A505C04D0"/>He is reproached with having retained the Swiſs guards, contrary to the conſtitution, which forbad it.</p>
               <p>Hear the facts: a decree had declared that the king ſhould be requeſted to preſent a new formation of his regiment of Swiſs guards, and nevertheleſs the aſſembly had ordained that it ſhould be continued as temporarily kept up until the aera of its formation. On the third of July the aſſembly ordered the departure of three battalions of this regiment. On the 17th the aſſembly received a letter from d'Affry, remonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt the decree, and claiming the capitulations. A new decree, ordering the departure of the two battalions, and d'Affry placed between the capitulations and the decree, adreſſes and remonſtrances to the aſſembly—they paſs to the order of the day, and the battalions quit Paris.</p>
               <p>I now proceed to ſuch facts as may be thought to concern him perſonally. He was at firſt attacked for not having ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the decree on the prieſts, and on the camp of Paris. I could ſay that the conſtitution granted him a ſanction abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely free, and that ſhould he be miſtaken, they could not attribute his error to him as a crime. But if a great number of citizens appeared to ſupport this laſt decree, a greater number ſeemed to reſiſt it; he thought it prudent to refuſe his ſanction: but at the ſame time, by a wiſe meaſure he ordered the camp at Soiſſons, and this camp was more uſeful to our armies than that of Paris would have been.</p>
               <p>His letter to the biſhop of Clermont is oppoſed to him: but it was an opinion purely religious, and anterior to his acceptance of the conſtitution; and when he accepted it, he did not think it free from ſpots, as even in the acceptance itſelf, legal reforms appear.</p>
               <p>He is reprobated with having paid his guard; but the aſſembly in ordering it to be diſbanded, had ſaid it ſhould be formed anew; it became therefore his juſtice and humanity to pay it till it ſhould be recompoſed.</p>
               <p>He has been reproached with having given aſſiſtance to the emigrants—with having protected by his ambaſſadors the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alition of powers. He has been reproached with his keeping a reſident at the court of Vienna. I anſwer, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly oppoſed the efforts of the emigrants—I will quote a fact: he is informed by his reſident, of an attempt made by the emigrants to obtain arms and ammunition at Frankfort,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:025499_0016_0FCDEC1D531AEE20"/>
and of the refuſal of the magiſtrate of Frankfort, He order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his reſident to thank the magiſtrate of Frankfort, and to invite him to perſiſt in his refuſal.</p>
               <p>I will venture to ſay, there is not a ſingle emigrant who has received aſſiſtance from him. He ſupplied the expences of his nephews, the eldeſt was fourteen, the ſecond only ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. There exiſted no law which fixed the age at which emigration was a crime—the Convention has made one—his nephews were without reſources: was it neceſſary that he ſhould ſmother the ſentiments of humanity? Becauſe he was a king, ſhould he ceaſe to be a relation? He has made pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to the gouvernante of his children; but ſhe had been gouvernante of his children, and had left France ſince 1789. Choiſeul Beauprie has been in Italy ſince 1790, and has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver borne arms againſt France. He has given aſſiſtance to Rochefort, but Rochefort was not an emigrant. He is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached with having remitted money to Bouille—the letter of Bouille ſays;
<q>Given to Monſieur, the king's brother, by his order.</q>
The truth is, that he never remitted pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary aſſiſtance to Monſieur, and the order there ſpoken of was that of Monſieur, not that of the king. All that he did was to be ſecurity for his other brother in a ſum of 400,000 livres, but it was in 1789, and he was induced to this ſtep by the motive of humanity.</p>
               <p>He is reproached with the manoeuvres of Dumouſtier at the court of Berlin; but Dumoſtier was not his agent, he was the agent of the princes, his brothers.</p>
               <p>A letter from Choiſeul Gouffier is alſo oppoſed to him. It was thought that becauſe he was the ambaſſador of Louis, they might impute to him the plans of Choiſeul Gouffier, but the letter itſelf of this ambaſſador proves that it was but three days after his recall, and on account of his recall, that he had formed an intrigue againſt the national ambaſſador who replaced him. It was Choiſeul who wrote, who acted, who ſpoke of his ſervices to the princes, the king's brothers, and the note proves that the king had no relation with him.</p>
               <p>I come now to the reproaches of ſubordination of ſeveral members of the legiſlative aſſembly. This plan reduced the liquidation of the offices ten millions, it diſcharged the natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal bank, and charged the civil liſt with the intereſt of this ſum. A corruption which turns to the profit of perſonal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:025499_0017_0FCDEC1F4CE3E958"/>
may be conceived: but a caption that leaves us all the ſhame, and ſecures to others all the profit is ſcarcely to be imagined—the fact is, and it reſults from the papers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the king, that it was he alone who prevented the plan of a decree from being laid before the aſſembly, and that he expreſſed his anger and indignation at it.</p>
               <p>A reproach has been made againſt him which has excited the indignation of the people, and which muſt in fact appear a heavy charge; he has been accuſed of having paid his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des du-corps at Coblentz. I muſt confeſs that this accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation made an afflicting impreſſion upon me, I even ſuſpected his good faith, the papers appeared to me deciſive. I now come to make a due reparation in the eyes of Europe. All the papers relate to the month of October, 1791; hear what the adminiſtrator of the civil liſt writes to the treaſurer in the month of November—"The intention of his majeſty is to continue the pay of his gardes-du corps till they are replac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but his majeſty means that the amount of this ſhall not be delivered in a total to the etat major, but to every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual at the bank of the civil liſt upon his own receipt, and his certificate of reſidence within the kingdom."</p>
               <p>All the papers have been made as public as poſſible, he has been denounced to France, to all Europe; all theſe heads of accuſation have been printed, and the paper, which alone anſwers all theſe accuſations, has been the only one unknown—this ought to be with the other papers. By what ſtrange fatality is it not found there? he has at length obtained, after much trouble an authentic copy of this letter from the office: he produces it to the eyes of Europe.</p>
               <p>I come, laſtly, to that diſaſtrous day, the 10th of Auguſt. If we had believed that he had committed the crimes imputed to him, you would not ſee us at this bar lending him the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of our courageous veracity. All your ſucceſſes ſince that day ſhould permit you to be generous—I demand only that you be juſt; he feared that his palace would be invaded, he kept up the moſt exact correſpondence with the popular au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>authorities, in ſhort the people are there, the procureur ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic reads, with regret doubtleſs, the Vth article of the law which orders to repel force by force, the gunners, as their only anſwer, diſcharge their cannon before him.</p>
               <p>Then the procureur ſyndic invites him to come to the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:025499_0018_0FCDEC205F8CC458"/>
aſſembly—he comes—an hour afterwards our misfortunes commence; how did the battle begin? I know not, hiſtory perhaps will be equally ignorant of it</p>
               <p>He is reproached with having paſſed his troops in review —well then reproach the mayor for having viſited the poſt—was he not a conſtituted authority? was not his authority a depoſit in his hands, to which the law forbid him to ſuffer the leaſt attack? I know it has been ſaid, that he had excited the inſurrection, to gain the end of his plan, but who is now ignorant that this inſurrection had been planned, ripened; that it had its agents, its council, its directory? who knows not that there had been ſigned acts and treaties on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p>Within this hall has been conteſted the glories of the 10th of Auguſt. I do not come to diſpute the glory; but ſince it has been proved that this day was meditated, how can it be attributed as a crime to him? and you accuſe him, and will pronounce ſentence againſt him! againſt him who never yet gave a ſanguinary order; againſt him who at Varennes, rather choſe to return a captive, than expoſe the life of a ſingle man! againſt him, who, on the 20th of June, refuſed every kind of aſſiſtance, and preferred to remain alone, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by the people.</p>
               <p>Hear hiſtory ſay, that Louis, exalted 20 years upon the throne, gave an example of morals, juſtice, and oeconomy, He aboliſhed ſervitude in his dominions; the people wiſhed for liberty—he gave it them.—The glory cannot be diſputed to him, that he has ever anticipated the deſires of the people —I ſtop—hiſtory ſhall finiſh—Think that hiſtory ſhall paſs a ſentence on your judgment.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Deſeze had ſat down, the unfortunate Louis aroſe with much emotion, and addreſſed the Convention in theſe words:—"Citizens, you have heard the manner and matter of my defence. I pledge myſelf that the ſtatement of my counſel is true in every reſpect. Perhaps this is the laſt time I ſhall addreſs you; but be that as it may, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide as you think proper, my conſcience does not reproach me. I feel inexpreſſibly hurt by one of your charges, viz. that I wiſhed to ſhed the blood of the people; and to have it ſaid that I excited the horrible inſurrection of the 10th
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:025499_0019_0FCDEC24104DA138"/>
of Auguſt. My ſoul is weighed down to the earth with the calumny, that I ever had any intention to cauſe the blood of the citizens to be ſpilt."</p>
               <p>The preſident then preſented him a note, and begged to be informed whether he knew the hand-writing.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Louis.</speaker>
                  <p>No.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Preſident.</speaker>
                  <p>Do you recollect theſe five keys?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Louis.</speaker>
                  <p>I cannot ſay that I do. I remember ſome placed at the Feuillans, but I cannot ſay that theſe are the ſame.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>The preſident aſked him if he had any thing more to ſay in his defence.</p>
               <p>He having anſwered in the negative, was permitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, which he did, attended by his counſel.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as he was gone, Manuel requeſted that the defence of Louis, as well as his accuſation, ſhould lay on the table, that every part of his defence ſhould be printed and diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among the members of the Convention, and ſent to all the departments. It was alſo decreed, that the defence ſhould be ſigned by the king himſelf and counſel.</p>
               <p>The remaining part of this day, and the two following, the Convention was occupied in hearing the opinions of the ſeveral members. Some were for paſſing ſentence of death immediately: others were for referring the ſentence to the primary aſſemblies: others, again, were for baniſhing him for ever, and making it death for him to return.</p>
               <p>On the 5th of January, 1793, the Convention received a letter from the king's counſel, containing ſome obſervations on a charge made againg the king by one of the members of the Convention, of having conſtantly kept two miniſters, one oſtenſible, the other private; and for having, in conſequence of this ſecret miniſtry, ſent Hayman to Pruſſia. They aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, that the king, at the time he projected his journey to Montmedi, had tranſmitted to Bouille the ſum of 993,000 livres, of which he was to give an account after his return to Paris. Bouille having retired to Luxembourg, the king's brother, who went thither alſo, finding himſelf without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources, took from Bouille the ſum of 670,000 livres. It was from this ſum that the princes took 3,400 livres for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of Hayman's journey to Pruſſia, on the king's ſervice. This exception was in conſequence of a very extraordinary affectation in the princes, when they formed ſentiments or
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:025499_0020_0FCDEC2591223B00"/>
entered into negociations with foreign powers. Louis could not prevent his brothers from abuſing his name; and in a denunciation made to the national aſſembly on the 31ſt of March, in the king's name, by the miniſter Dumourier, of a treaty between the princes and Hohenloe, Dumourier was particularly charged to teſtify to the aſſembly how much the king was afflicted and diſtreſſed an account of this ſtep. On the 5th of July he denounced a loan of eight millions, nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated for the princes, in Holland, by one Harel-la-Verter. They concluded by this remark; that had there exiſted a ſecret miniſtry, ſome proofs would have been among the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers found at the Thuilleries, when the palace was attacked, as the king was in the habit of preſerving all his papers.</p>
               <p>On the 14th, the Convention adopted the three follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing queſtions, propoſed by the preſident:
<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>Is Louis guilty or not guilty of high treaſon; and of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts againſt the general ſafety of the ſtate?</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>Shall the appeal to the people take place?</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. <hi>What puniſhment ſhall he ſuffer?</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The next day it was decreed, that the ſenſe of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention ſhould be taken on each queſtion, by a nominal call: and one of the ſecretaries having read the firſt queſtion, and having finiſhed the call, the preſident declared, that of 735 voters, 693 had voted in the affirmative, and therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced <hi>Louis Capet guilty of high treaſon and attempts againſt the general ſafety of the ſtate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond queſtion was then put, and there appeared a majority of 280 againſt an appeal. The preſident then roſe, and ſaid, <hi>The National Convention doth decree, that the ſentence which it ſhall pronounce upon Louis Capet ſhall not be referred to the appeal of the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 16th the Convention took up the third propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; when, after a very long debate, the preſident roſe and announced, that of 720 votes, 366 were for death. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of which, he declared in the name of the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the puniſhment which they pronounced againſt Louis Capet was—<hi>death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 19th the Convention paſſed the following decree unanimouſly:—</p>
               <p n="1">1. The executive council ſhall be ſummoned to meet at 11 o'clock to-morrow morning, and a copy of the decree which pronounces ſentence againſt Louis ſhall be delivered them.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="23" facs="unknown:025499_0021_0FCDEC2713B862B8"/>2. The executive council ſhall be charged to notify this decree to Louis in the courſe of the day; to cauſe it to be executed within twenty-four hours after it has been notified to him; to take every meaſure of ſafety and police which to them ſhall appear neceſſary during the execution; to be careful that no inſult be offered to his remains, and to give an account of their diligence to the Convention.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The mayor and municipal officers of Paris ſhall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined to ſuffer Louis to communicate freely with his family, and to have with him ſuch prieſts as he may deſire in his laſt moments.</p>
               <p>On the 20th the miniſter of juſtice informed the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the executive council had been ſummoned, and had aſſembled early in the morning, in order to execute the decree relative to Louis Capet. The council had called the mayor, the department, the commandant-general, and public accuſer to their aſſiſtance. Having concerted with theſe the meaſures of execution, the miniſter of juſtice, preſident of the executive council, a member of council, the ſecretary, and two members of the department, went together to the temple about 2 o'clock, and being introduced to Louis, the preſident of the executive council told him, that they were charged to notify to him the extract from the minutes of the Convention, dated the 15th, 17th and 19th of January, which the ſecretary then read.</p>
               <p>Louis preſented them with a written paper, ſigned with his own hand. They anſwered that they would deliberate thereon; and having retired, reſolved that it ſhould be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Convention.</p>
               <p>The following is a copy of the paper given by Louis to the preſident of the executive council.</p>
               <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">

               <p>After this paper was read, the Convention decreed that there was no room to deliberate thereon, having anticipated the greater part of the requeſts, in the decree of the day before.</p>

               <head>THE EXECUTION.</head>
               <p>On the 21ſt, conformably to the arrangements made by the executive council, Louis was put to death at the Place de la Revolution, heretofore Place de Louis XV.</p>
               <p>Twenty-five citizens of known principles, well armed, acquainted with the manual exerciſe, and having each 16 rounds of ſhot, were choſen from each ſection to form a guard of 1200 men, who accompanied the unfortunate monarch to the place of execution.</p>
               <p>Strong detachments from the different legions were poſted in the ſtreets through which the royal priſoner was to paſs, and alſo in all the avenues leading to the Place de la Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to prevent any confuſion, and each ſection had a body in reſerve, ready to move at moment's warning, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain public order, ſhould any attempt be made to diſturb it.</p>
               <p>Cannon were alſo diſtributed in every quarter, where it was thought they could be any way ſerviceable, had events made it neceſſary to have employed them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="unknown:025499_0023_0FCDEC2B90C07B90"/>Between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, Louis proceeded from his apartments in the Temple, and got into the Mayor's carriage, who accompanied him, as did alſo M. Edgworth, or de Formont, an Iriſh prieſt, whom he requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed might attend him. Louis was dreſſed in a brown great coat, white waiſtcoat, black breeches and ſtockings; his hair was dreſſed.</p>
               <p>The proceſſion commanded by M. Santerre, proceeded along the Boulevard, to the Place de la Revolution. One hundred Gendarmes on horſeback formed an advanced guard to the proceſſion. The rear guard was compoſed of one hundred national guards from the military ſchool. Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reſerves of cavalry lined the proceſſion, and patroled the the out-ſkirts of the city.</p>
               <p>The unfortunate monarch arrived at the foot of the ſcaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold at twenty minutes paſt ten. He mounted the ſcaffold with firmneſs and dignity—and appeared deſirous to addreſs the people. Drums and trumpets gave the ſignal, and at twenty-two minutes paſt ten his head was ſevered from his body. The Place de la Revolution was ſo ſtrongly guarded by troops, that no perſon was ſuffered to paſs after the king had entered it, thoſe however who had previouſly entered and got near enough to the ſcaffold, notwithſtanding the noiſe of drums and trumpets, heard him plainly pronounce theſe words—"Citizens, I forgive my enemies, and I die innocent!"</p>
               <p>Louis, on mounting the ſcaffold, inſtantly took off his great coat and unfaſtened his ſhirt collar. His hair had been clubbed up cloſe like an abbe, that no indignity might be offered him, or that it ſhould occaſion delay by hanging looſe. The executioner went up to tie his arms, which the king recoiled at; but it was ſoon done—The executioner then took a large pair of ſciſſars to cut off his hair, at which the king appeared very much mortified, and ſaid, "I have put all right." His hair, however, was cut off.</p>
               <p>When the executioner ſhewed his head to the people, cries of "Vive la nation! Vive la Republic!" were heard on all ſides.</p>
               <p>His body was tranſported to the pariſh-church of La Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delane, where it was interred without any inſult being offered
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:025499_0024_0FCDEC2EF6FC81F0"/>
to it, between the perſons who loſt their lives during the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations on account of his marriage, and the Swiſs who fell on the 10th of Auguſt.</p>
               <p>Louis, before his departure from the Temple, delivered to the Commiſſioners of the Council General, who were upon the guard, his latter will, two copies of which he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on the 25th of December laſt.</p>
               <p>Thus periſhed in the 40th year of his age, Louis XVI. once the generous friend and ally of the United States, but who, by the infernal machinations of a wicked miniſtry, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred the hatred of his nation.—A dreadful example to thoſe princes who trample on the ſacred "Rights of Man."</p>

            <p>In the name of the Holy Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, Amen.</p>
            <p>I, <hi>Louis the XVI.</hi> king of France, having been for better than four months detained with my family in the tower of the temple of Paris, by thoſe who were my ſubjects, and depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all communication, even with my family ſince the 11th inſtant, beſides being involved in a proceſs of which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to know the event, in conſequence of the paſſions of men who can alledge no good pretext for their conduct, and who have no motive that can be ſupported by any exiſting law—thus circumſtanced, without any perſon preſent but God to witneſs my ſorrows, to whom I may have recourſe, I DO DECLARE here in his preſence, this to be my laſt will and determination.</p>
            <p>I recommend my ſoul to God my Creator, whom I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech to receive it in mercy and not to judge it as it deſerves, but through the merits of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf a ſacrifice to God his Father, for all men, however unworthy they may be, and I the unworthieſt of them all.</p>
            <p>I die in union with our Holy Mother, the Catholic Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolic and Roman church, which holds its powers by unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted ſucceſſion from St. Peter to whom Jeſus Chriſt had confided it.</p>
            <p>I firmly believe and confeſs all that is contained in the creed, the commandments of God, and of the church, the ſacraments and miſteries, ſuch as they are and always were taught by the Catholic church.</p>
            <p>I never pretended to judge of the different modes of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining the tenets which divide the church of Jeſus Chriſt, but have conformed myſelf to them, and always will do ſo whilſt God ſhall ſpare my life; to the deciſions which eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtic ſuperiors give and may give according to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I pity, with all my heart, thoſe of my brethren who may live in error, I do not pretend to judge them, but I love them all in Jeſus Chriſt, according to the precepts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian charity.</p>
            <p>I devoutly pray to God to forgive my ſins having previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſcrupulouſly confeſſed and repented of them, not having been able to avail myſelf of the aſſiſtance of a Catholic prieſt,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:025499_0026_0FCDEC32528DBD98"/>
I pray to God that he may receive this confeſſion which I have made, and eſpecially my profound repentance which I feel for having ſigned, although contrary to my inclination, any acts which may have diſagreed with the faith or diſcipline of the holy Catholic church to which I have ever adhered with all my heart.</p>
            <p>I pray to God to receive my firm reſolution, if he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves my life, to avail myſelf of the firſt opportunity of the miniſtry of a Catholic prieſt, in order to accuſe myſelf of all my ſins, and to receive the ſacrament of penance.</p>
            <p>I beg pardon of all thoſe whom I may inadvertently have injured, for I do not remember to have deliberately offended any one, and alſo I beg pardon of all to whom I may have ſet any bad example, and I hope they will forgive me, if they think they have been injured thereby.</p>
            <p>I beſeech all charitable perſons, that they unite their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with mine, in order to obtain a pardon from God for my ſins. I forgive with all heart, all thoſe who have acted as my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies without my having given cauſe, and I pray to God to pardon them as well as thoſe who by a falſe or miſguided zeal have done me great injury.</p>
            <p>I recommend to God my wife and children, my ſiſter, my aunts, my brothers, and all thoſe allied to me by blood, or in any other manner, every other poſſible connection. I parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly pray to God to look down in mercy on my wife my children and ſiſter, who have ſuffered with me ſo long, and that he will ſupport them with his grace, in caſe they ſhould loſe me, and that I ſhould be taken from this tranſitory world.</p>
            <p>I recommend my children to my wife, of whoſe mater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal tenderneſs I never have doubted, and I recommend to her to educate them in the principles of chriſtianity and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral honeſty, and that ſhe may teach them to look upon the ſplendor of this world in caſe they ſhould be condemned to it as upon dangerous and tranſient good, and I hope ſhe may lay before their view only the principles of ſolid and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting glory.</p>
            <p>I beſeech my ſiſter to preſerve her attachment to my children, which ſhe has always ſhewn, and that ſhe will act the part of a mother in caſe they ſhould be ſo unhappy as to loſe their own.</p>
            <p>I beſeech my wife to pardon all that ſhe has ſuffered in
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:025499_0027_0FCDEC346AF61BA0"/>
conſequence of her attachment to me; as well as for any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt I may have occaſioned her ſince our union: likewiſe, I declare that I do not reproach her with any thing, though ſhe herſelf might think that ſhe has ſomething to repent of.</p>
            <p>I alſo earneſtly requeſt from my children, that after per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming their duties to God, which ought always to be their firſt conſideration, they will ever be united and obedient to their mother and grateful for all the carefulneſs and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows ſhe way ſuffer for their ſake, and remembrance of me. I requeſt that they may look on my ſiſter as their mother.</p>
            <p>I recommend to my ſon, if ever he ſhould be ſo unhappy as to be a king, that he muſt think it his duty to devote himſelf entirely to promote the happineſs of his fellow citizens, and to bury in oblivion all rancour and reſentment, and eſpecially every thing which reſpects the injuries and abuſes inflicted on me. He cannot make the people happy, without conforming to the laws of the country; but at the ſame time to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that a king cannot make himſelf reſpected, nor do the good he would wiſh, unleſs he be inverted with ſufficient au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, otherwiſe he will be obſtructed in his operations, and not inſpiring any reſpect, he will be more prejudicial than uſeful to his country.</p>
            <p>I recommend to my ſon to take care of all thoſe perſons who have ſhewn affection for me, whenever his circumſtances will permit, and he ſhould conſider it as a ſacred debt, which I have contracted with the children and relations of thoſe who died on account of their attachments to me, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently with thoſe who are unhappy for my ſake. I know that ſeveral perſons who were attached to me, have not done by me as they ought to have done, and who have even ſhewn themſelves ungrateful. I forgive them however: as, in times of trouble and efferveſence, perſons are not always maſters of themſelves, and I requeſt of my ſon, in caſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity ſerves, that he will remember that they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy.</p>
            <p>I could wiſh to teſtify at this moment my ſincere gratitude to all thoſe who have ſhewn me a true and diſintereſted at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment towards me: if on the one ſide I felt very ſenſibly the ingratitude and diſloyalty of thoſe men to whom I had never done any thing but loading them with benefits, as well as their friends; on the other ſide I have had the conſolation
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:025499_0028_0FCDEC3550F7FA98"/>
to witneſs the affection and diſintereſted friendſhip which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral perſons have ſhown me. I beg they will receive my thanks, becauſe in the preſent ſituation of things I would be afraid of expoſing them ſhould I ſpeak more explicitly. I recommend them, however, eſpecially to my ſon, that he may acknowledge them if ever it is in his power.</p>
            <p>I ſhould, notwithſtanding, think that I am calumniating the ſentiments of the nation, if I did not recommend expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to my ſon Meſſieurs Chamilly and Hue, whom the ſincere affection they bore me, has induced to ſhut themſelves up in this melancholy abode, and who have run the riſque of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the unhappy victims of their attachment; I alſo recommend Clery, my valet-de-chambre, to whom much praiſe is due for the trouble he has had with me, and as he has been with me to the laſt moment, I requeſt the gentlemen of the municipality to give him my cloaths, my books, my watch, my purſe, and the remainder of the effects that are depoſited with the common council.</p>
            <p>I alſo freely forgive all thoſe who guarded me, for the ill treatments and hardſhips which they have thought proper to put upon me.</p>
            <p>I have found ſome feeling and compaſſionate minds, who, I wiſh may enjoy that tranquility to which their way of thinking entitles them.</p>
            <p>I requeſt Meſſrs. Maleſherbes, Trouchet, and Deſeze, to receive here, my moſt ſincere thanks, and the expreſſion of my ſenſibility for all the fatigues and labours which they have gone through for my ſake.</p>
            <p>I conclude with declaring in the preſence of God, and on the point of appearing before him, that I am innocent of the crimes that are imputed to me.</p>
