            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AT what time, or on what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion this <hi>Pſalm</hi> was penned by <hi>David,</hi> we are not told; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Contents of it give us to underſtand, that it was a time of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated trouble with him; his Enemies were grown inſolent, and gave him great moleſtation; and his Sins mean while pained his Conſcience, and diſquieted his
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000964_0003_0FADE49D2B524560"/>
mind; it may therefore be well ſuppoſed to refer to the diſturbances which were occaſioned by <hi>Abſaloms</hi> unnatural Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, which was conſequent upon, and a threatned correction for his great ſin in the matter of <hi>Uriah.</hi> The <hi>Pſalm</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is a prayer of Faith with which he addreſſeth God in this condition; and is made up of petitions, and pleas where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with thoſe petitions are enforced; intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced with a profeſſion of his recumben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on God in the midſt of his diſtreſs, <hi>verſe</hi> 1, 2. The Petitions, though inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven in the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> may be reduced to two heads, <hi>viz.</hi> for deliverance from his Enemies, and a diſcharge from the Guilt of his Sins; in each whereof he fortifies his Faith, and ſtrengthens his importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with ſuitable arguments. Our <hi>Text</hi> is a <hi>Petition</hi> of the latter ſort. In the words we may obſerve;</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Object</hi> to whom he directs it, the <hi>Lord</hi>; the word is, <hi>Jehovah,</hi> which is a proper and incommunicable name of God, and is no where aſcribed to any ſecond being whatſoever, but to the true God alone.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:000964_0004_0FADE49DCF0759E0"/>2. The benefit which he petitioneth for, <hi>viz. pardon or forgiveneſs</hi>; the word properly ſignifies to pardon, or to ſpare of free grace or mercy, without any the leaſt deſerving in the Subject to whom it is applied: and <hi>Criticks</hi> obſerve that it is moſt commonly uſed in the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> for ſuch a forgiveneſs as is afforded, upon an oblation that hath been offered to God for the expiation of the Guilt contracted by the perſon; ſo that we may here ſuppoſe the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> to have an eye of Faith upon the Sacrifice of Chriſt, which was to ſatisfie the Juſtice of God, in order to the obtaining of a Pardon for Sinners. Pardon preſumes Guilt, and ſuppoſeth it to be removed by it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſpecial Subject about which he petitioneth this benefit to be conferred upon him; <hi>mine iniquity:</hi> and here two things are to be conſidered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is Iniquity, in the ſingular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. I confeſs the word is ſometimes u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the ſingular number, as a name of multitude, comprehending in it all the Sins which the perſon hath ever been
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000964_0005_0FADE4A3A8027650"/>
guilty of: but it ſeems here to refer <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſome one, which his Conſcience was pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly wounded with the remembrance of, and may probably refer to that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated ſin of his that he had been guilty of, which hath already been mentioned; and the word here rendred, <hi>Iniquity,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <hi>pravity,</hi> or <hi>perverſeneſs,</hi> and is uſed for the more bold and high-handed tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, that men do ſometimes run themſelves into; the word is alſo often intended for <hi>Original Sin,</hi> which is the pravity or perverſeneſs of our nature, and unto which we ought to have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in all our Confeſſions of ſin unto God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is his own ſin, <hi>mine iniquity</hi>; he doth not lay it upon any other, but aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth it wholly and entirely to himſelf, and acknowledgeth that he hath rendred himſelf Guilty by it; under which there is neceſſarily implied a confeſſion, both of the ſin it ſelf as chargeable upon him, and alſo of the deſerved Guilt that he hath contracted to himſelf by it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The arguments by which he ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000964_0006_0FADE4A3DE83B0F8"/>
his Faith in making of this petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: indeed, every word doth tacitly carry an argument or plea in it, as might be made evident, but there are two which are expreſſed in the <hi>Text; viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. He pleads Gods <hi>Name</hi> for it: By the Name of God we are to underſtand God himſelf, as he hath revealed himſelf unto us in his Glorious Perfections, in which alone we can ſee any good ground to hope or pray for pardon; and hence it either points us to the <hi>Attributes</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which ſhine forth in the procuring and applying of this forgiveneſs; or to the Glory which will redound to thoſe <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ributes</hi> by it; or to <hi>Chriſt</hi> who is the purchaſer of this mercy for us, and may be equivalent to that in, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.17. <hi>Hear the prayer,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for the Lords ſake</hi>; and God himſelf hath ſaid concerning Chriſt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.21. <hi>My name is in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. He looks upon the greatn<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> of his ſin, <hi>for it is great.</hi> To what <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ead we are to refer this argument, is matter of diſpute, and accordingly there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent reading given to it by Interpreters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:000964_0007_0FADE4A492C8BB28"/>
The particle tranſlated <hi>for,</hi> is variouſly uſed in the Scriptures; and more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in two ſenſes: it is ſometimes uſed <hi>Illatively,</hi> to bring in the reaſon of that which went before, and then it is read <hi>for,</hi> and thus our Tranſlation under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it: and ſo it is uſed by <hi>David</hi> as an argument to enforce his pleading for pardon from God, in regard of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his ſin; ſometimes it is uſed <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretively,</hi> upon the grant of a thing which might ſeem to look to the contrary, and then it is read <hi>although</hi>; and ſo have ſome rendred it in our <hi>Text:</hi> and then it is put to encourage faith to ſeek a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don notwithſtanding the greatneſs of his ſin; that he fortifieth againſt the diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement which that might afford him. The word <hi>great,</hi> is uſed in the Scriptures both for <hi>magnitude</hi> and <hi>multitude,</hi> and is to be tranſlated according as the ſenſe will carry it, and both of them are often comprehended. If we take ſin here <hi>aggregatively,</hi> to comprehend all his ſins, both original and actual; it then intends that they are very many, and grievouſly
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000964_0008_0FADE4A555FBEE00"/>
aggravated; but if we underſtand it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for ſome one particular and ſpecial ſin; it then intends that it is a very great one, and that it hath a great many wrapt in it; and the <hi>pronoun</hi> particle, which is rendred <hi>it,</hi> is Emphatical: it intimateth as much, as if he did point with his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the particular iniquity, and ſay of it, <hi>this, this is a very great ſin</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>There are a great many precious prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Truths contained or implied in theſe words, which I cannot willingly overpaſs without ſome brief glance at them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I come to the Caſe ſpecially intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>DOCT. I. <hi>The Children of God may ſometimes fall into very Great Sins. David</hi> was ſuch an one at this time: he was a true Believer, <hi>a man after Gods own heart</hi>; and yet he acknowledgeth his Sin, and puts that note upon it. Every Sin is great, as it is againſt God, and is a Violation of his Law; for the leaſt affront offered to that glorious being cannot be ſmall: but there are ſome which are aggravated
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000964_0009_0FADE4A66D6EA168"/>
Sins; either as they are the more direct breaches of ſome of the greater and more leading Commands of God, or as they are awfully circumſtanced, by which they are rendred the more preſumptuous; and ſuch was that of <hi>David</hi> in both reſpects, as we ſhall find it amplified on in, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. <hi>begin.</hi> That Godly men may fall into ſuch Sins, there needeth no more to make it evident, than the inſtances of ſuch in the word of God, which are there pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely recorded for our learning and warning. Beſides, <hi>Original Sin,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in all Gods people as long as they live, hath every luſt comprized in it, it being a whole <hi>Body of Death,</hi> and if God leaveth them to themſelves, it will drag them into Captivity. So <hi>Paul</hi> complains of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. And God doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo leave them, as is ſaid of him, 2 Chron. 32.31. <hi>God left him, to try him.</hi> Gods people are under the Command, as it is a Rule of Obedience, and every tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion or coming ſhort in it is a Sin; nor doth their being his Children make it no Sin, or a little one: but it is a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Beware of thinking your neglects or violations of the Command to be no Sins. How many have ruined their own Souls, by miſunderſtanding of that <hi>Text?

            <p>DOCT. II. <hi>When God brings outward troubles on his People, theſe Sins of theirs may peculiarly trouble them.</hi> Thus it was with the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> at this time; and this gave the Occaſion for his putting up the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in our <hi>Text.</hi> God ſometimes brings perſonal afflictions on his own, for their tryal, as he did upon <hi>Job</hi>; and yet then it is good for them to make a diligent ſearch after Sin in themſelves. But very often they are the corrections which he lays on them for ſome bold tranſgreſſions of theirs: and, becauſe he intends to uſe
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000964_0012_0FADE4ABDB2FB398"/>
them for their Correction and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he therefore gives them ſome notice or other about thoſe Sins, either by his Word and Ordinances, directing his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to meet with them, or in the very Language of the Providences themſelves; with which he toucheth their Conſciences, and makes them reflect, and charge ſuch Sins upon themſelves. Thus he did unto <hi>David,</hi> by <hi>Nathan</hi> in, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. <hi>begin</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by <hi>Gad,</hi> when he had <hi>numbred the People, Chap.</hi> 24.10. And when it is ſo, they are more diſtreſſed with the conſideration of their ſin, than with the affliction that is procured by it. Yea this is it which puts the greateſt bitterneſs into the affliction it ſelf, and well it may, becauſe hereby they diſcern anger in the rod, which is more terrible to them than all the rage of Death and Hell: yea they could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to be corrected, ſo they might but be aſſured that it were not in wrath, but in love and compaſſion; hence that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the Prophet, <hi>Jer</hi> 10.24. <hi>Oh Lord, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, leſt thou bring me to nothing</hi>

            </p>
            <p>It may be for the preſent, you may ſwallow the bait, and not feel the hook to prick you, but you know not how ſoon God may in his Providence viſit you with ſome remarkable affliction, and then bring this ſin to your remembrance, and if he do, you will find the bitterneſs of it; little do you think at preſent, how much gall and wormwood this will put into the Cup: now the laſhes of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence within, will be more terrible than all the outward ſtroaks of Providence, though never ſo ſevere. Now it will be a comfortable Cordial, to be able at ſuch a time to ſay as the Church, Pſal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 44.17, 18. <hi>All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falſly in thy Covenant.

III. <hi>There is ſometimes one ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that lies more heavily on the Conſcience of Gods Children, in a time of trouble.</hi> The deſign of Affliction indeed, is to put us upon the making of a thorough ſearch for all ſin; but oftentimes there is ſome one that gives ſpecial occaſion for the affliction, God being peculiarly provoked by it, and thereupon the Spirit of God bears it more heavily on the Conſcience at ſuch a time than any other, though thereby he leads us up to the fountain of all, as he did <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 53.3. <hi>with</hi> 5. <hi>I know my tranſgreſſions, and my ſin is ever before me; behold I was ſhapen in iniquity</hi>; and it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that God is more eſpecially diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by ſome one ſin, than by others, and the ſin it ſelf is more prodigious and preſumptuous, and leaves deeper wounds in the Soul, which when the ſenſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is revived, draw our thoughts that way, and God will leave proportionable impreſſions on our hearts thereby.</p>
            <p>USE. <hi>And let this be a constant caution

            </p>
            <p>Doth God at any time make one ſin ſo bitter to us, that we cannot endure the terrours of it, but are ready to ſink under them; the burden of them hath ſuch a load that we are oppreſſed with it, and roar under it? Surely he doth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by caution us to look to our ways, and beware of multiplying tranſgreſſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; if one be ſo terrible, what will many be? this ſhould put force in that argument, and make it powerful in our reſiſtance, Gen 39 9. <hi>How can I do this great wickedneſs and ſin againſt God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>DOCT. IV. <hi>The Sins of Gods own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple stand in need of forgiveneſs.</hi> Not only thoſe ſins which they committed before they were Converted; and their perſons were Juſtified, but thoſe they fall into af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards do need a pardon. Though they are as to their ſtate, delivered from Condemnation, and ſhall no more be in danger of the Eternal Wrath of God; which is a great encouragement to them
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000964_0016_0FADE4AE571AB410"/>
to hope for, and to ſeek remiſſion upon their falls: yet when at any time they are overtaken with ſin, they provoke God thereby, and lay themſelves open to his holy Diſpleaſure, and can have no peace in themſelves, or ſecurity from his Judgments, till a pardon be gotten. There is a ſort of <hi>Guilt</hi> that cleaves to them, which they muſt ſeek the removal of in order to the reſtoring of their comfort; he prays for this, Pſal. 51.12. <hi>Restore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me the joy of thy ſalvation</hi>; for this reaſon our Saviour made it a petition to be daily put up by all his Diſciples, Mat. 6.12. <hi>Forgive us our Debts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>USE. <hi>Let this then Excite us, if at any time we are overtaken with any ſin, to be reſtleſs till we have obtained the pardon of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this end let us maintain in our ſelves the exerciſe of Repentance. God hath put theſe two together, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31. <hi>Him hath he Exulted by his Right-hand, to give repentance to Iſrael, and remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Take heed of nouriſhing carnal ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000964_0017_0FADE4B07B9A0E80"/>
with the preſumption of your juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified Eſtate, and thinking that you are thereby ſafe, ſo as that God will not charge any tranſgreſſion upon you; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure we our ſelves, that ſin which we have not repented of, and gotten a ſealed pardon for, will look terribly upon us, when Conſcience ſhall charge it home, and we have nothing to ſhew for the forgiveneſs of it.</p>
            <p>DOCT. V. <hi>The Children of God muſt ask for a pardon, if they would obtain it.</hi> God hath appointed a <hi>medium</hi> for the conveyance of thoſe ſaving benefits to his people, which have been purchaſed by Chriſt for them: and he hath made prayer to be neceſſary in this order, <hi>Ezek</hi> 36.37. <hi>I will for this be enquired of by the houſe of Iſrael, to do it for them</hi>; hence that in Jer. 29.12, 13. <hi>Then ſhall ye go and pray to me, and I will hearken unto you; &amp; ye ſhall ſeek me, &amp; find me, when ye ſhall ſearch for me with all your heart</hi>; and as he hath required it, ſo he hath encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged it, Pſal 50.15. <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee.</hi> God
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:000964_0018_0FADE4B09028FA68"/>
hath a pardon ready, only he waits to be asked for it, that we may, by ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, teſtify the ſenſe that we have of our need of it, and acknowledge to him his great kindneſs to us, when we obtain it. Nor indeed are we in a fit poſture to receive a pardon at his hand, till we are brought upon our knees, that we may take it of him in that humble and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate poſture; and in this prayer there muſt be a cordial ſenſe of the ſin, and of the great vileneſs of it, accompanied with a ſincere Confeſſion of it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore till we come to this, we may expect to be in ſore diſtreſs; but in this way there is relief to be had. We have an account of <hi>Davids</hi> experience in both theſe reſpects, Pſal. 32.3, 4, 5. <hi>When I kept ſilence, my bones waxed old,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged my ſin to thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and thou forgaveſt the iniquity of my ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>USE. <hi>Let this then direct us what to do, when we are under Conviction and Remorſe, by reaſon of any ſin that we have made our ſelves Guilty by.</hi> Let it direct us to prayer;
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:000964_0019_0FADE4B199A08FE8"/>
and let us encourage our Faith in prayer. Is this the way to obtain forgiveneſs? let us not be ſo unwiſe as to go without it, for want of ſo doing: how juſtly will God continue us under our diſtreſs, if we neglect to ſeek a deliverance from it? and to eſtabliſh our ſaith in praying for this benefit, let us conſider that God never rejected any that duly ſought to him for it; how many, how great, how aggava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſoever their ſins have been; he waits to be called on, and he takes notice who it is that doth ſo. Even a perſecuting and malicious <hi>Saul,</hi> when he is made to fall upon his knees, hath that remark made upon him, Acts 9.11. <hi>behold he prays.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>DOCT. VI. <hi>God alone is to be addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for pardon</hi> We muſt not only ask it, but of him, if we would obtain it. Men may be wronged by us, and if we have offered them any injury, it is our duty to ſeek reconciliation with them, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend proper means for that end; but it is God who is ſinned againſt, Pſal. 51.4.

               <hi>Againſt thee, thee only have I ſinned</hi>; and therefore he muſt be ſought to for a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. Forgiveneſs of ſin is a Divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative; none can apply it authentically to the Sinner but God: if it comes not under his hand and ſeal, it ſignifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. It is true, we muſt go to him for it in Chriſt's name, or elſe we ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly miſs of it; for it is one of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits which he hath purchaſed for us, at the price of his own blood; but we muſt not ſeek it any where elſe. The Jews were in the right of it, in <hi>Theſi,</hi> when they ſaid, <hi>Mark</hi> 2.7. <hi>None can forgive ſins but God. David</hi> therefore giveth this praiſe to him alone, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.3. <hi>Who forgiveth all thine iniquities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>USE. <hi>Let this encourage us to hope for forgiveneſs, and accordingly to ſeek it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is the object at whoſe hand it is to be ſought.</hi> And indeed there is great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive contained in this conſideration; inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he hath a ſtock of it with him; this the Pſalmiſt pleads; Pſal. 130.4. <hi>There is forgiveneſs with thee, that thou
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:000964_0021_0FADE4B65B1BC9F0"/>
mayſt be feared</hi>; he hath laid in a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency for it, in the Redemption wrought out by Chriſt, of whom we are told, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. <hi>That he is able to ſave to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt all that come to God by him</hi>; and he hath an heart diſpoſed to pardon ſuch as do come to him aright for it; and hence it is one of his <hi>Titles</hi> in which he hath commended himſelf to us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.5. <hi>Thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive</hi>; let us then be ſure to apply our ſelves to him for it, and ſeek it at no other door; and in this way we are likely to ſpeed. How ready was the Father to meet, and how kindly did he entertain his return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prodigal, Luk. 15.20. <hi>He aroſe and came to his father: but when he was yet a great way off, his father ſaw him, and had compaſſion, and ran, and fell upon his neck, and kiſſed him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>DOCT. VII. <hi>The ſenſe of Guilt ſhould not diſcourage Gods People from ſeeking of him deliverance in times of trouble.</hi> It is indeed then an hour of Temptation; Satan, and a miſgiving heart, at ſuch a
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:000964_0022_0FADE4B79AF4B220"/>
time, offer to drive us to deſpondency, when ſin and ſorrow meet together. However the people of God ought not to be overwhelmed in their minds, when it is ſo, and think it in vain to hope and ſeek for deliverance of God, becauſe he is juſtly provoked at them. <hi>David</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves againſt giving way to ſinking fears in ſuch a condition, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.5. <hi>Wherefore ſhould I fear in the day of evil, when the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of my heels ſhall compaſs me about?</hi> and that was the encouragement which that good man offered to the Jews at ſuch a time, in <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.2. <hi>We have treſpaſſed againſt our God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yet now there is hope in Iſrael concerning this thing</hi>; and truly, both theſe are Gods works, and he is to be waited on to do them, both to put away the ſin which hath provoked him to bring trouble upon us, and to remove the ſorrow that hath been procured by our ſin: the one therefore ought not to diſcourage us in regard of the other, but rather to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite us to make haſte the faſter to him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:000964_0023_0FADE4B8160855C8"/>USE. <hi>Let this then rebuke ſuch as nouriſh deſpondencies and deſpair in them, by ſuch reflexions as theſe are.</hi> God indeed afflicts you, that he may thereby make your Sin bitter to you, and humble you to his feet, under the ſenſe of it; but this is not to drive you from him, or to make you think that he will not hear and help you in your trouble, but to excite you the more earneſtly to ſeek it of him. And truly, there is nothing that ſhould make us more earneſt in going to God for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, when we are under his afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand, then to conſider that our Sins have procured this for us, and therefore there is none that can give us deliverance but he, inaſmuch as he alone can take away the cauſe of our trouble, which is our Sin.</p>
            <p>DOCT. VIII. <hi>The proper courſe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain deliverance from trouble, is to ſeek firſt the forgiveneſs of Sin.</hi> This is it which is the <hi>Moral</hi> procuring cauſe of that; and as long as ſin remains unpardoned, Gods
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:000964_0024_0FADE4B8DF409858"/>
controverſy abides; and then it is not to be wondered at, if our crys and howlings for deliverance are not heard. God therefore directs to ſuch a courſe as this is in a time of diſtreſs; <hi>Joel</hi> 2.12. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now turn to me with all your heart, and with faſting, and weeping, and mourning,</hi> &amp;c. And tells them what ſucceſs it ſhould have, <hi>Verſe</hi> 18. <hi>Then will the Lord be jealous for his land, and pity his people,</hi> &amp;c. Till then, the ſin be repented of, and taken out of the way, God threatens that he will go on in his anger, <hi>Joſh</hi> 7.12, 13. <hi>Neither will I be with you any more, except ye deſtroy the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed thing from among you: Thou canſt not ſtand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accurſed thing from among you.</hi> And indeed, if we have not obtained a pardon of God, the outward deliverance which he affords us, is but a reſpite, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy ſtill abides.</p>
            <p>USE. <hi>Learn hence the miſerable folly of thoſe who, in times of trouble, ſeek no farther than to have their outward Calamity removed.</hi> This is the ready way to loſe all our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:000964_0025_0FADE4B996106830"/>
or put caſe they ſhould ſucceed, this very ſucceſs would be in a way of anger and not of love; and we have a great deal of reaſon to be afraid of ſuch a deliverance. Would we have a gracious and an abiding deliverance at any time? Let us make that our great care, to ſee that God and we are atoned; this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was the Churches triumph after all her ſorrows, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 12. <hi>begin. I will praiſe thee: though thou was angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedſt me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>DOCT. IX. <hi>Confeſſion is to be made of particular Sins, in order to the obtaining a Pardon of them. David</hi> indeed mentions all his Sins, <hi>Verſe</hi> 18. <hi>Look upon mine affliction, and my pain, and forgive all my Sins.</hi> But he alſo ſpecifies them, as in <hi>Verſe</hi> 7. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member not the Sins of my Youth.</hi> And he comes to individuals, <hi>Text, Pardon mine Iniquity.</hi> He brings one ſin, and ſpreads it open before God, and prays, Lord, pardon this Sin: And thus we have him again at it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.14. <hi>Deliver me from blood guiltineſs, O God, thou God of my Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:000964_0026_0FADE4BA4F773E68"/>
And the truth is, there can be no kindly Repentance of ſin, unleſs we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to particulars: For, though we muſt be acquainted with, and bewail the fountain of ſin which is in us, yet we are led up unto this by the ſtreams that iſſue from it; nor can we have a kindly apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it, but by feeling the woful effects of it in thoſe fruits that grow upon it, and which are diſcovered in our hearts and lives. And indeed, all conviction of ſin beginneth here, though it terminates not in one, but leads us farther, even into thoſe <hi>Chambers of Imagery,</hi> where all <hi>Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations</hi> are to be ſeen.</p>
            <p>USE. <hi>Hence ſee the folly and deceitfulneſs of general Confeſſions and Repentances.</hi> For, though we can never reach, to every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual ſin that we are chargable withal; for <hi>Who can underſtand his Errors! Pſal</hi> 19.12. And ſo it is impoſſible for us to ſpread every one particularly before God in our acknowledgments; yet it is a great truth, that he who hath not ſeen and bewailed his own vileneſs in ſome particular ſins,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:000964_0027_0FADE4BF4BCD4938"/>
hath never done ſo at all in truth. Theſe general Confeſſions; <hi>I and all men are Sinners; the Lord forgive me, I am not perfect,</hi> &amp;c. are miſerable ſenceleſs things, and he that cannot tell wherein he is ſo, and lay his finger upon the ſore, hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Confeſſed his Sin to God aright.</p>
            <p>DOCT. X. <hi>Our plea for forgiveneſs is to be built on Gods Name.</hi> If we would pray for it ſucceſsfully, we muſt pray be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievingly, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.6. <hi>But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering.</hi> And faith muſt have ſomething to bear its weight upon: And it is of Infinite concernment that it be ſomething that will hold it up, elſe it will fail us, and leave us to ſink in deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondency. Our prayers muſt be argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative, but we muſt ſee that the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments that we make uſe of are good, otherwiſe they will not avail us. There are many that pray, and plead with much vehemency, but they ſpeed not; and why? but becauſe they ground their pleadings wrong, build them on a falſe bottom. Some plead their own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:000964_0028_0FADE4C02F790F98"/>
and goodneſs; So did that <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, Luk.</hi> 18.11. <hi>God, I thank thee, I am not as other men,</hi> &amp;c. but he was not Juſtified in that way: whereas the poor <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> had but one plea, and that ſucceeded, <hi>Verſe</hi> 13. And we then ask in Gods Name, when we renounce all our reliance elſe where, and acknowledge our entire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence to be on his free Grace, of which he hath the Sovereign diſpoſal in his own hands. When we acknowledge our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of the contrary, and reſolve all into his undeſerved mercy: So he applied himſelf to God, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.8, 9. <hi>O Lord, to us belongs confuſion of face: to the Lord our God belong mercies &amp; forgiveneſſes, though we have rebelled againſt him.</hi> And reaſon good, for all our hope of finding acceptance with God, is in the New Covenant, which was opened on purpoſe for the diſplay of the riches of his Grace, which is through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: this then is the Name of God by which he commends himſelf to fallen man.</p>
            <p>USE. <hi>Learn hence, that the more humble
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:000964_0029_0FADE4C056121DB0"/>
we are, the more fit are we to ask, and the more likely to obtain pardon from God.</hi> The humble Soul ſees nothing in himſelf, no worthineſs at all of his own; is put by all pleas from any thing that he either is or hath; he ſees that there is no hope for him but in the free Grace of God, and it is vain for him to look any where elſe: and therefore he reſolves to improve no other arguments in his petitioning of God for pardon, but ſuch as refer to his Great Name.

way for the greater glory to be aſcribed to him by them, when they ſhall experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence his free pardon beſtowed upon them, notwithſtanding the manifold pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation there was given him by thoſe ſins of theirs: and this is the very thing that God aims at in the Diſpenſations of his grace to his people that have ſinned againſt him.</p>
            <p>USE. <hi>Learn we hence the great folly of thoſe who ſeek to encourage their hope of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, by mincing, extenuating and excuſing their ſins.</hi> How many are there who ſeek to quiet their Conſciences, and ſtrengthen their faith by this? <hi>I confeſs I have not done well, I cannot deny but that I have failed, and ought to have been more watchful to my ſelf; but I hope that God will not charge it upon me; I was tempted, it was too hard for me, I allowed not my ſelf in it, and it is no ſuch great matter, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in my circumſtances would have done as bad or worſe, &amp;c.</hi> This is to undermine the great aim of the New-Covenant, &amp; is a certain evidence that ſuch an one is not

brought to a kindly repentance. True, we ought not ſo to aggravate our ſin as to drive us to deſpair, as <hi>Cain</hi> did, who ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Mine Iniquity is greater than can be forgiven</hi>; for this will hinder us from going to God: but we ought to put every other aggravation to it, which the nature and circumſtance of it call for.</p>

            <p>DOCT. XIII. <hi>A right conſideration of the greatneſs of our ſin, is very helpful to our profitable ſeeking a pardon from God. David</hi> makes uſe of it to this very purpoſe in our <hi>Text</hi>: And here cometh in that great Caſe to be enquired into, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> This Caſe being practical; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Children of God have daily occaſion to make uſe of it in their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to him in prayer, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to give a diſtinct account of it; and to make way to the thing it ſelf, let me offer the following Concluſions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That pardon of ſin is an act of Gods free grace.</hi> As a pardon ſuppoſeth a ſin whereby the perſon hath made himſelf Guilty, elſe there would be no occaſion for it; ſo it is a ſpecial way whereby the Guilt comes to be removed. It finds the perſon inſolvent, utterly unable to repair the wrong he hath done to the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Glory of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo make ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for his Guilt, and thereupon it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers him from it frankly; thus our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt expreſſeth it in that <hi>Parable,</hi> Luk. 7 42. <hi>When they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both.</hi> Nor could
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:000964_0036_0FADE4C5E39C3218"/>
ſin have ever been remitted to the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in any other way but this; for, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could he for himſelf, nor yet could the whole Creation for him, make a due compenſation to injured Juſtice on his account: <hi>So dear is their Redemption, and it must have ceaſed for ever,</hi> Pſal. 49 8. and that God would thus forgive him, is an act of meer grace, to which he was not at all obliged by any natural neceſſity, but was altogether free in it; and the Sinner had given him ſufficient provocation righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly to have deſtroyed him for ever.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That hence God uſeth his abſolute Soveraignty in chuſing the Subjects of the application of it.</hi> That this pardon is not a priviledge beſtowed upon all Guilty Sinners, is a truth plentifully born witneſs to in the Word of God. Though <hi>all have ſinned,</hi> Rom. 5.12. Yet all Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are not forgiven, but there are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes left to <hi>dy in their ſins,</hi> and there is by this a great diſcrimination made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween men. Now, if a reaſon of this difference be ſought, it muſt be reſolved negatively, that it is not becauſe one is
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:000964_0037_0FADE4CAAF475908"/>
in himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or his natural ſtate better than another, for we read, <hi>Rom</hi> 3.9. <hi>Are we better than they? no, in no wiſe</hi>; and verſe 22. <hi>There is no difference</hi>; and Eph. 2.3. <hi>We are children of wrath by nature, even as others.</hi> Nor is it becauſe one addreſſed God for it. and the other neglected ſo to do; for God ſaith, Iſa. 65.1. <hi>I am found of them that ſought me not,</hi> and we are told, Luk 19.10. <hi>The Son of man is come to ſeek &amp; ſave that which is loſt.</hi> Nor is it becauſe that God foreſaw that theſe would accept of Chriſt upon the offers of him made to them, and believe in him, and that the others would refuſe him, and harden their hearts in unbelief, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>judge themſelves unworthy of eternal life</hi>; for with regard to multitudes of thoſe who are not pardoned, they never had any revelation of Chriſt, and of forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be obtained by him, made unto them; or any terms of reconciliation and peace propoſed to them, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly never did refuſe their compliance with them: and as to thoſe to whom this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery is made, he could foreſee nothing
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:000964_0038_0FADE4CC101B2F28"/>
in them, but what he <gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="1 span">

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That hence nothing in the Subject can be properly a motive to put him upon beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this favour upon it.</hi> The will of God, being the Supream cauſe of all his works of Efficiency, cannot be moved by any thing out of himſelf, to do any of them: for then it were not abſolutely free and independent, as it is. The very notion of a <hi>Motive,</hi> refers to an impulſive cauſe, moving upon the affections, &amp; that either by <hi>Inſtinct,</hi> as in ſenſitive creatures, or by <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſwaſions,</hi> as in Rational beings; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when it is attributed to God, we are to conceive of it after the manner of men: and what can there be in the Subject that ſhould move God to this Compaſſion? Not the miſery which it is under by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Curſe and Condemnation that is upon it; for, as it juſtly deſerves it, and

               </gap> delights in the manifeſtation of it; So the ſame miſery lyeth upon all ſuch to whom this pardon is not given; for there is no other way to remove it but only one: and yet theſe are equally his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with the other, and every whit as capable of being made the monuments of mercy, in whom the glory of it would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually ſhine forth. Nor is it the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in any making of them more ready to accept of a pardon &amp; to cloſe in with the Goſpel terms on which it is offered, for our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Math.</hi> 11.21. <hi>If the mighty works that are done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented long ago in ſackcloth and aſhes</hi>: And the Apoſtle confeſſeth, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.3. <hi>We our ſelves were ſometimes diſobedient.</hi> Nor the greatneſs of their Sin; for, as the greater the Sin is, the more of provocation is thereby offered to God, and his holy and juſt indignation is incenſed proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly;
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:000964_0040_0FADE4CD548B00B0"/>
So there are as great Sinners paſſed by and not pardoned, as any that are made to ſhare in this benefit. We muſt therefore, after all our enquiries, finally reſolve all into a <hi>What if God willing, Rom.</hi> 9.22.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>That yet there is ſomething in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject from which God takes the advantage to advance his Glory in pardoning of them</hi> We conceive of God as an Intelligent Agent, or a cauſe by Counſel, and accordingly that he muſt neceſſarily have ſome worthy deſign, and ſuch as becometh himſelf, in all his works. Hence, as he hath a laſt end in them, which he reſolves to advance by them, ſo he doth wiſely accommodate all the <hi>Media</hi> moſt advantageouſly to ſerve to this end: and though the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance be of ſuch an unfathomable depth, as infinitely tranſcends our ſhort compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, yet we muſt under write with him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.24. <hi>O Lord, how manifold are thy works! in wiſdom haſt thou made them all.</hi> God ſeeks his own Glory in the pardoning of a Sinner, for the exaltation whereof, he taketh an occaſion from

ſomething in the Sinner, by the which he may carry on this purpoſe of his, and from thence get to himſelf a great Name: So that though he is not moved by it, but acts his pleaſure, yet he makes uſe of it in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviency thereto; we are told in 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>That there is a way in the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which God hath laid out for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of this benefit to us.</hi> Not only did he lay in for the procuring of ſuch a favour to be conferred upon Sinners; which was done in the Covenant of Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhip, in which he indented with his own Son to lay down the purchaſe of it; but for which it could never have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on any of <hi>Adams</hi> Children, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Righteouſneſs of the firſt Covenant; but he hath alſo made known how they may come to obtain a Title to this benefit, and this is held forth in the Covenant of Grace.

Sinners in the treaty of Peace which he opens and manageth with them in the external and miniſterial diſpenſation of the Covenant, but they do alſo give us to underſtand after what manner God will by his Grace convey a pardon to Sinners, by a powerful working of the terms in all thoſe whom he hath a deſign to make partakers therein; So that if ever he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them, he will bring them, to it in this way; &amp; therefore there is an inſeparable connexion made between them in the Goſpel; <hi>Mark</hi> 16 16. <hi>He that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved, and he that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not, ſhall be damned</hi>; &amp; Joh. 3.36. <hi>He that believeth in the Son of God, hath ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life; and he that believeth not the Son ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6 <hi>That to this way belongs their coming to him for, and their asking it of him.</hi> When God had mentioned the many and great priviledges of the New-Covenant, which he promiſed to beſtow upon his people, at ſuch time as he ſhould return to them in a way of Grace, he enters that clauſe,

Nay, it is a wonderful condeſcendency in the Great God, and an admirable expreſſion of his rich grace, that he hath given encouragement to ſuch to come unto him for it, by promiſing that if they ſo come, they ſhall ſpeed,

Guilt, ſo the asking a pardon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes a Confeſſion of that Guilt, and the righteouſneſs of the Sentence contained in it: And to ſuch a Confeſſion is the encouraging promiſe made, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13. <hi>Whoſo confeſſeth and forſaketh ſhall have mercy</hi>: and of the good ſucceſs of ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>David</hi> ſets the Seal of his experience, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.5. <hi>I ſaid I will confeſs my tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions to the Lord; and thou forgaveſt the iniquity of my Sin.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. <hi>We muſt renounce all that is in our ſelves, as to any dependance on it to obtain a pardon withal</hi> We muſt not only reject other objects, but all arguments, but what are fetcht from God himſelf. We muſt have no confidence in the fleſh; bring nothing of our own to make a plea with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, but lay our ſelves in the duſt pleading nothing but the meer mercy of God: we muſt come in the form and quality of beggars; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Come without money, and without price</hi>; that ſo we may receive it of him as an alms. And in ſpecial we are to reject our own Righteouſneſs, and refer our ſelves to the compaſſion of God,

We are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to refer it to his free will, believing that it is in his power to do ſo for us, and ſay as the <hi>Leper</hi> did, <hi>Math.</hi> 8.2. <hi>Lord, if thou wilt, thou canſt make me clean.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>We muſt come in Chriſt's Name.</hi> There is no other way in which God commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates the ſaving benefits of the New-Covenant, but through Chriſt, who hath purchaſed them for us: and therefore to come in any other Name is altogether vain, and will prove altogether fruitleſs. <hi>God</hi> out of Chriſt, <hi>is a conſuming fire, Heb.</hi>

            <p n="6">6. <hi>We muſt ask in Faith.</hi> This is a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification belonging to every Evangelical Duty, in order to its finding acceptance with God, for we are told, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>That without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God</hi>; for, as the bond of union on our part; between Chriſt and us, is faith, ſo we are to maintain Communion with him in all his priviledges by the continued exerciſes of it; Heb. 10.38. <hi>And the Juſt ſhall live by his faith</hi>; and to hope to be heard in any other prayer, but ſuch as mounts to heaven on the wings of faith, is vain; that is a caution always to be carried with us, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.6. <hi>But let him ask in faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Hence, whatſoever ſerves to the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our right ſeeking of God, is profitable in this caſe.</hi> That which is a proper and an approved help to our obtaining of pardon, and finding the good and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort

of it, and being helped ſuitably to acknowledge God in it, will be of great uſe in our prayers: for, God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed us to make uſe of thoſe helps which he hath told us of in his Word, and hath accommodated to be ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our doing our duty; and indeed we cannot do well without them. We muſt go to the Word of God for our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection about theſe, nor may we ſuppoſe that it is left to our own fooliſh arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to uſe things which our own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are moved by; but we are to acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs in what God hath commanded, who only is able to bleſs them unto good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>There are many reſpects in which the conſideration of the greatneſs of our ſins will be helpful in this affair</hi>; and theſe are now to be conſidered of, for the more direct reſolution of the Caſe before us, which are more eſpecially ſuch as follow.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>This conſideration rightly entertained, will put us upon ſeeking a pardon.</hi> Though all the loſt, progeny of <hi>Adam</hi> ſtand in
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:000964_0050_0FADE4D79399DA50"/>
need of forgiveneſs, yet how few are there of thoſe, among whom this benefit is proclaimed, and who are with all ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs invited to embrace it, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it, or enquire how they may come at it? The Prophets complaint is ſtill of force, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.1. <hi>Who hath believed our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port?</hi> The moſt of men that ſit under the Goſpel, do practically bid Chriſt to depart, and carry his pardon where it is wanted, if he would put it off, as for them they need it not, they deſire it not; why elſe do men live content with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one, or why do we hear no more crying out, <hi>What ſhall we do to be ſaved</hi>? And ſurely this is either becauſe they do not believe themſelves to be Sinners, and under Guilt, or elſe becauſe they do not know what it is to be ſo. Whereas a looking upon Sin in its true colours, and its greatneſs, will ſerve to promove this enquiry, and make us ſerious in it; and that,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>By ſhewing us the greatneſs of our Guilt.</hi> Guilt derives from the Sanction of the Law, and is the binding of the
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:000964_0051_0FADE4D85B0C83C8"/>
Sentence of the threatning of it upon the perſon, who hath by ſin brought himſelf under it. Hereupon the greater the ſin is, the more ſevere is the threatning, and conſequently the more aggravated is the Guilt, and great Guilt that is felt muſt needs make perſons proportionably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to get it removed. He who looks upon ſin to be but a ſmall thing, reckons the Guilt of it eaſy to bear, and that makes him regardleſs of getting it taken away. <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.9. <hi>Fools make a mock of ſin.</hi> Whereas he that apprehends his ſin to be great, feels his Guilt heavy, and would fain be eaſed of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38 1. <hi>with</hi> 4. <hi>Lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath; for mine iniquities are gone over mine head; as an heavy burden, they are too heavy for me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>By convincing us of what reaſon there is that we cannot expect to eſcape the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned miſery, unleſs we get a pardon.</hi> The reaſon why the generality of ſinful men are no more concerned to get the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that is upon them removed, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they think it is no ſuch great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:000964_0052_0FADE4D93609F818"/>
whether it be or no; and that which maketh them ſo eaſy in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, is a preſumption that they nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in themſelves, that God will not exact ſo ſeverely upon them, as his Miniſters do give them warning of, and that there is more fright than hurt in theſe threatnings. We have men of ſuch a ſpirit as this characterized, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.19. <hi>When he hears the Words of this Curſe, he bleſseth himſelf in his heart, ſaying, I ſhall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart</hi>; and there are a great many ſuch as theſe who live in places of light. Whereas, did men believe that they ſhall not eſcape, except a pardon be ſeaſonably obtained, they could not be ſo quiet: and the reaſon why they do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, is becauſe they have ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minitive thoughts of their ſin. When therefore God comes to convince Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the woful danger they ly open to, he diſplays their ſin to them in its vileneſs and abominableneſs, and when he hath ſo done, he challengeth them
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:000964_0053_0FADE4D9D1897C98"/>
to be judges whether there be any ground to expect that he ſhould not execute the Sentence of his wrath upon them: <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.7, 9. <hi>How ſhall I pardon thee for this? Shall I not viſit for theſe things?</hi> And this puts us upon deliberating with greateſt intenſneſs on that demand, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. <hi>How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect this ſo great Salvation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>By perſwading us of the fearful miſery that awaits us, if we get not a pardon.</hi> Guilt binds Sinners over to puniſhment, and this penalty holds a proportion with that Guilt: and there are greater miſeries for thoſe that have been Guilty of greater Sins. Hence, by the ſuitable apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the greatneſs of our Sin, we ſhall be filled with a ſuitable terrour at the expectation of the greater wrath that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waits us: and he that hath <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> right conception of the miſery which is deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the leaſt Sin, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to get it removed: How concerned then muſt the Soul needs be, which hath in its view the proſpect of thoſe peculiar effects of Divine revenge, which he hath
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:000964_0054_0FADE4DD61C0F208"/>
expoſed himſelf unto, and is every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lyable to the execution of, if he gets not into the <hi>City of Refuge?</hi> See how it was with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 32.4. <hi>Day and night thine hand was heavy upon me, my moiſture is turned into the drought of Summer.</hi> And doubtleſs it was this apprehenſion that brought him into ſuch a condition.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>This Conſideration will make us to go to God, and him alone for pardon.</hi> We are too ready to ſeek our help in other objects, but this will keep us from going to, or knocking at any other door: it will make us to ſay to our ſelves, as he, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.5, 6. <hi>My Soul wait thou only upon God; he only is my rock, and my ſalvation:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that;</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>By ſhewing us that ſuch Sins cannot have their Guilt removed, but by a free pardon.</hi> That if it be not given to us, we can never have it. This affords an undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble demonſtration that it muſt be utterly beyond our ability to make ſatisfaction to the offended Law, and at one the Juſtice of God to us; that <hi>Thouſands of Rams,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:000964_0055_0FADE4DE9DCED430"/>
and ten Thouſand of Rivers of Oyl</hi> will not do it; and that if it be not provided for and given to us on free coſt, we muſt deſpair of our getting it. The want of having ſuch a view of Sin, makes men to think that a confeſſion, and overly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, a good work, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will make amends, make up the breach between God and them, and turn away his wrath from them: whereas this drives them out of their refuges of lies, and ſhews them that the demerit of Sin out-bids all they can do for the expiation of it, and that therefore they muſt ſeek ſome where elſe for it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>By diſcovering that none elſe can pardon them but he.</hi> The greatneſs of Sin truly diſcovered carries evidence in it, that it cannot be leſs than a Divine work to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give it. Men that have low thoughts of Sin, reckon a pardon to be nothing; but they that ſee how great it is, believe that it is a work of Omnipotency. When <hi>Moſes</hi> petitioned God to pardon his peoples ſin, he requeſts that he will manifeſt his power in it, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.17. <hi>And now I beſeech thee,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:000964_0056_0FADE4DF925AF980"/>
let the power of my Lord be great</hi>: and the extenſiveneſs of his mercy, <hi>Verſe</hi> 19. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, I beſeech thee, the iniquity of this people, according to the greatneſs of thy mercy.</hi> And in this Article God is acknowledged to be incomparable, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.18. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and paſſeth by the tranſgreſſion of the remnant of thine heritage?</hi> Nor indeed is there any thing in which he more appears to be God, than in this: and the conviction of it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe great Sins require a great God to forgive them; and thereupon it muſt be ſought of him alone.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>By aſſuring us that if we obtain it not of him, we muſt needs periſh.</hi> When Sin comes to be felt in its weight, it not only ſaith in our Conſciences that we muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther get it removed from us, or elſe it will ſink us into the nethermoſt hell, but alſo that we muſt go to God for it, or we are undone. That <hi>Deſtruction</hi> is upon us, and that he only can <hi>Ranſom</hi> us from it, by forgiving us. It ſaith, that if an holy God finds us under the Guilt of theſe Sins, and that if we have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:000964_0057_0FADE4DFDF00EB90"/>
a pardon under his hand, <hi>We cannot eſcape the vengeance of Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>This Conſideration helps to humble us into a right frame in our coming to God for pardon.</hi> There is a right frame, and only the humble Soul hath it, and this is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by ſuch thoughts divers ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It beats us off from our own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> When we go to God for remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we would fain carry ſomething of our own with us, to ſatisfie our pleadings withal, and encourage our hope for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance by, and this proceeds from pride, and is the principal reaſon why awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sinners ſtand off, and are not willing to apply themſelves to God for it. But when our ſin appears to be exceeding ſinful, our hands are now knocked off, we lay aſide all ſuch pretenſions; and now we are made to come as <hi>poor, miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, blind, and naked</hi> Creatures. This makes true beggars of us, and puts us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the poſture of the <hi>Publican,</hi> of whom, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.13. <hi>The Publican ſtanding afar off,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:000964_0058_0FADE4E091235828"/>
would not lift ſo much as his eyes unto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſmote upon his breaſt, ſaying, God be merciful to me a ſinner.</hi> We now ſee that there is no other hope but what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves entirely unto Gods mercy.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>It helps us to juſtify God</hi>; and there is no hope for us to ſpeed in asking for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of him, without this. God will have the glory of his free grace, aſcribed to him by every one whom he forgiveth; and this will never be, till we plumply confeſs that the greateſt ſeverity of his Law is very righteous; that we are juſtly condemned, and that there is no injuſtice at all to be imputed to him: hence that in, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.8, 9. <hi>To us belongs confuſion of face, to the Lord our God belong mercies and forgiveneſſes</hi>; and we can never come up fully to this, till we ſee a world of vileneſs in our ſin, and the more we ſee of this, the more will our hearts be perſwaded of Gods righteouſneſs, which is one thing that the Spirit cometh to <hi>convince us of, Joh.</hi> 16 8. and till it be ſo, Sinners will be ever finding fault with
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:000964_0059_0FADE4E158920230"/>
the Law, and charging cruelty and injuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice upon it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>It helps us in our confeſſions.</hi> There is a thorough confeſſion which we obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that God expects of us in order to our obtaining forgiveneſs from him: he would not have us to mince and curtail it, but the more ample and aggravated it is, the more is God honoured by it; becauſe it carries in it a diſcovery of the deeper ſenſe that we have of it on our hearts. He that hath a right conception of the evil there is in Sin, will then ſee that he cannot exceed in expatiating on it, and laying of himſelf low by it. They are but lank Confeſſions which that man will make, who doth not <hi>Know the plague of his own heart,</hi> and how evil and bitter his Sin is: God therefore invites his people to this, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Know and ſee that it is an evil and bitter thing, that thou haſt forſaken the Lord thy God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>It ſerves to further our importunity.</hi> Our Cryes for pardon ought to be very urgent and earneſt, as of thoſe that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:000964_0060_0FADE4E254A1D088"/>
the forlorn condition that Sin hath put us in; and nothing will make them to be ſo, but the reſentment which we have on our hearts of that ſin which gives us the Occaſion to pray for pardon. It is felt trouble that draws forth our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to have it removed from us; and therefore theſe requeſts will be more or leſs earneſt in proportion to that ſenſe: light thoughts of ſin, will produce but flat and complemental petitions about it; but terrible apprehenſions of it, will put us upon loud cryes to have it taken away. Such doubtleſs was <hi>Davids</hi> ſenſe, when he prayed in, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41.4. <hi>Lord, be merciful to me, heal my Soul, for I have ſinned againſt thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>It Commends to us the Merits and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Chriſt.</hi> We are directed by the Goſpel, to ſeek for pardon on Chriſt's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; and we are told that our reliance for the obtaining it, muſt be upon his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. Now this ſhews us how infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely we are beholden to him, for that he hath thus laid in for us, and ſo it comes to make his Obedience very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:000964_0061_0FADE4E2CF888830"/>
to us. There are none that prize a Saviour ſo as they do, who have found ſin to be beyond meaſure evil, and the guilt of it to be beyond any other power of taking it away, but the vertue of his Sacrifice: it will make us to ſay with <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.14. <hi>The Grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>It makes us reſtleſs till we get an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of peace from God to our petitions.</hi> They that have ſlighty conceptions of ſin, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect their prayers, and regard not what becomes of them: but this will put us upon repeated requeſts, &amp; agreeable fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency in them, whiles God ſeems to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay us, and make us to reſolve that we will never let him alone, or take a denial of him. He that knows what his ſin will righteouſly coſt him, when he comes to receive his recompenſe, if it be not now forgiven, will follow God unweariedly, until he hath given him a ſealed pardon; this was it which drew forth thoſe repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted requeſts which <hi>David</hi> puts up to him, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="63" facs="unknown:000964_0062_0FADE4E723902810"/>4. <hi>This conſideration will alſo ſerve to help our faith.</hi> Satan indeed, and a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving heart will make uſe of it to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us: and put us upon deſpair by looking on our ſins in their magnitude and multitude; but the Spirit of God, in thoſe who are his, fortifies their faith with it, and that in two reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It tells us there is a work for God to do.</hi> God acquaints us in his word, which is the Rule of our faith, that he delights to do like himſelf in all his works; and then to diſcover his glory to us, when all other help and hope fails us; and what is this but to draw up our <hi>Eyes to him,</hi> when <hi>we cannot tell what do do?</hi> Faith therefore will now argue, what though it out-bids all the power of the Creation to take away the Guilt of theſe grievous Sins of mine, yet God can do it, and in doing of it he will give a ſignal demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his power. Faith ſaith, I know and am fully perſwaded that God can forgive it if he pleaſe, let it be never ſo great, and there is an occaſion now for
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:000964_0063_0FADE4E870E695D0"/>
him to make it appear how ſufficient an object of truſt he is, when all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge fails; and <hi>herein make me a pattern to them that ſhall hereafter believe on him to life everlaſting.</hi> 1 Tim. 1.16.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It alſo tells us that he will herein Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify his Grace abundantly.</hi> An eye of faith alſo looks upon the great deſign of the New-Covenant, to be the making of the Grace of God to appear in its moſt ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent colours: and therefore the believing ſoul under the deep ſenſe of ſin, thus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth; here is an opportunity for the Grace of God to be the moſt reſplendent: how will the pardoning mercy of God be herein magnified? how will the inexhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible vertue of Chriſt's Obedience be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by demonſtrated? God will in this get to himſelf a name, which ſhall be celebrated with the moſt joyful acclamations of praiſe to eternal ages. It therefore helps us belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly to put up that petition, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79.9: <hi>Deliver us, and purge away our ſins for thy name ſake</hi>; and to back it with that ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, <hi>verſe ult. So we thy people, and ſheep of thy paſture, will give thee thanks for
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:000964_0064_0FADE4E99582DDD0"/>
ever; we will ſhew forth thy praiſe to all generations.</hi>

            <p n="5">5. <hi>This conſideration will alſo help to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare us for a right improving of this pardon, when we have obtained it.</hi> When Gods people have gotten any thing of him in a way of prayer, they ought to return to him the acknowledgment thereof in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and therein to uſe it for his Glory, Pſal. 50.15. <hi>Call upon me, and I will deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thee, and thou ſhalt glorify me</hi>; and in reſpect to pardon, this conſideration will abundantly contribute hereto; for,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It will make us the more to admire the riches of Grace appearing in it:</hi> Gods great aim is at the glory of this, in all the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial favours which he confers upon his own, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6. <hi>To the praiſe of the glory of the riches of his grace</hi>; and the more our hearts are touched with the apprehenſion of this, the more will they be filled with admiration at, and acclamations to it. Now, the greater our ſins have been, and found ſo to be by our right conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, the more doth the grace
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:000964_0065_0FADE4EA58492DA8"/>
appear, that was exerted in the procuring for, and applying to us, a free pardon of them. Such therefore will be alwayes harping upon this ſtring, and think that they can never enough expatiate on it. This made <hi>Paul</hi> ſo to commorate on the diſplaying of the Grace of God that had been manifeſted in him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1, 12. <hi>to</hi> 17.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It will enflame our hearts the more with love to God.</hi> There are none in the world, whoſe love burneth ſo bright to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Chriſt, as of thoſe whoſe ſins have been exceedingly great, and born home upon their Souls with the apprehenſion of the greatneſs of them, to conſider that this notwithſtanding, God hath forgiven them all freely. So our Saviour argueth, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.47. <hi>Her ſins which are many are forgiven, for ſhe loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the ſame loveth little.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>It will make us to walk the more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fterwards.</hi> There is nothing which more helpeth the Grace of Humility, to its perfect working in a Child of God,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:000964_0066_0FADE4EB1DDF6A48"/>
than the remembrance of what horrible and deep died ſins he hath been guilty of, and that yet God ſhould forgive them. He is ever reflecting on theſe two toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; what his Sins have been, and what a pardon is beſtowed upon him: he will be on all occaſions turning his eye this way; and indeed the greatneſs of Sin will never work to a kindly Humiliation, till it be joyned with the apprehenſion of a pardon.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>It will help us the more chearfully and ſtedfaſtly to Serve God for the future.</hi> Such an experience as this, when it works kindly on the Soul, will mightily ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Obedience; and this is a fruit of that love which it doth produce and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite in the heart: it will, as often as he turns his eye that way, make him to ſay as he, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.12. <hi>What ſhall I render to the Lord for all his benefits to me?</hi> and now he thinks that he can never do or ſuffer too much for the honour of that God who hath ſo appeared to him.</p>
            <p>USE. <hi>Let it ſerve to direct us in the right
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:000964_0067_0FADE4EBE522F540"/>
improvement of ſuch a conſideration as this is; and that may be in two reſpects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Beware of taking Satans gloſſes.</hi> He will endeavour all he can to make us count Sin to be nothing, ſo long as he can keep us in carnal ſecurity by ſuch an eſteem, and for that end ſupplies us with arguments of the fleſh, accommodated thereto: and when the Spirit of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth the man of his ſin, and ſo he can hold this device no longer, he then would make our Sin appear great beyond the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of a pardon, ſo to precipitate us into deſpair: take heed of this, it will drive you from the uſe of means, and ſo undo you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Oppoſe to the conſideration of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your ſin, and ballance it with theſe three things, and eſtabliſh your faith on them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The great ſufficiency there is in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Chriſt.</hi> It is through this that you come to have any hope of a pardon. Hence the Apoſtle refers it hither, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.14. <hi>In whom we have Redemption through
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:000964_0068_0FADE4EC993988E8"/>
his blood, even the forgiveneſs of Sins.</hi> Out of doubt then there is hope for pardon for all thoſe ſins, which do not exceed the vertue of that Redemption: and this is declared to be very extenſive, Hebr. 7.25. <hi>He is able to ſave to the uttermoſt all that come to him</hi>; think then what a price he paid for this purchaſe: we are put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch a conſideration, 1 Pet. 1.18, 19. <hi>Ye are redeemed, not with corruptible things, as ſilver and gold, but with the precious blood of the Son of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The deſign of the New Covenant.</hi> In that it is that your hope is revealed to you; the Old Covenant had none in it: Now conſider that the opening of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant were to ſet forth the riches of Grace in the ſalvation of Sinful man by Chriſt; ſo long therefore as you have a proſpect how Grace may be exalted in your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pardoned, let <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p n="3">3. <hi>The contrivance of infinite Wiſdom to make Juſtice and Grace to agree in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</hi> This is uſually a great diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Satans temptation, when Sin is

Let then the greatneſs of our ſins drive us the faſter to Chriſt, reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that if he will he can pardon them, and if he do, Everlaſting <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> ſhall be Sung to him on that account.</p>
