            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>MR PRESIDENT AND GENTLEMEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BY your unanimous vote, to honour with an Eulogium, the diſtinguiſhed charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the late DR. WILLIAM CULLEN, Profeſſor of Medicine in the Univerſity of Edinburgh, you have done equal homage to Science and Humanity. This illuſtrious Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician was the Preceptor of many of us:—He was moreover a diſtinguiſhed citizen of the republic of Medicine, and a benefactor to Mankind; and although, like the ſun, he ſhone in a diſtant hemiſphere, yet many of the rays of his knowledge have fallen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this quarter of the globe. I riſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to mingle your grateful praiſes of him, with the numerous offerings of public and private reſpect which have been paid to his memory in his native country. Happy will be the effects of ſuch acts of diſtant ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:022862_0004_0FBA9C005C67E190"/>
if they ſhould ſerve to unite the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſcience with that of commerce, to leſſen the prejudices of nations againſt each other, and thereby to prepare the way for the operation of that divine ſyſtem of morals, whoſe prerogative alone it is, to teach man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind that they are brethren, and to make the name of a fellow-creature, in every regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world, a ſignal for brotherly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p>IN executing the taſk you have impoſed upon me, I ſhall confine myſelf to ſuch parts of Dr. Cullen's character as came within the compaſs of my own knowledge, during two years reſidence in Edinburgh.—To his fellow citizens in Great Britain, who were more intimately acquainted with him, we muſt reſign the hiſtory of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic character, as well as the detail of all thoſe ſteps which, in early life, led him to his unparalleled height of uſefulneſs and fame.</p>
            <p>DR. CULLEN poſſeſſed a great and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal genius. By genius, in the preſent inſtance, I mean a power in the human mind of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the relation of diſtant truths, by the ſhorteſt train of intermediate propoſitions. This precious gift of Heaven, is compoſed
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:022862_0005_0FBA9C01D9A2D5F0"/>
of a vigorous imagination, quick ſenſibility, a talent for extenſive and accurate obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a faithful memory, and a ſound judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Theſe faculties were all united in an eminent degree in the mind of Dr. Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len. His imagination ſurveyed all nature at a glance, and, like a camera obſcura, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to produce in his mind a picture of the whole viſible creation. His ſenſibility was ſo exquiſite, that the ſmalleſt portions of truth acted upon it. By means of his talent for obſervation he collected knowledge from exery thing he heard, ſaw, or read, and from every perſon with whom he converſed. His memory was the faithful repoſitory of all his ideas, and appeared to be alike accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate upon all ſubjects. Over each of theſe faculties of his mind a ſound judgment pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided, by means of which he diſcovered the relation of ideas to each other, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by produced thoſe new combinations which conſtitute principles in ſcience. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the mind has been called invention, and is totally different from a mere capacity of acquiring learning, or collecting know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge from the diſcoveries of others. It e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levates man to a diſtant reſemblance of his Maker; for the diſcovery of truth, is the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:022862_0006_0FBA9C0382236CA0"/>
perception of things as they appear to the Divine Mind.</p>
            <p>IN contemplating the human faculties, thus exquiſitely formed, and exactly balan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, we feel the ſame kind of pleaſure which ariſes from a view of a magnificent palace, or an extenſive and variegated proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect; but with this difference, that the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, in the firſt inſtance, is as much ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to that which ariſes from contemplating the latter objects, as the mind of man is ſuperior, in its importance, to the moſt fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed productions of nature or of art.</p>
            <p>DR. CULLEN poſſeſſed not only the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius that has been deſcribed, but an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common ſhare of learning, reading, and knowledge.</p>
            <p>HIS learning was of a peculiar and uſeful kind—He appeared to have overſtepped the ſlow and tedious forms of the ſchools, and, by the force of his underſtanding, to have ſeized upon the great ends of learning, without the aſſiſtance of many of thoſe means which were contrived for the uſe of leſs active minds. He read the ancient Greek and Roman wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters only for the ſake of the knowledge which they contained, without waſting any of the efforts of his genius in attempting to imitate
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:022862_0007_0FBA9C080626D828"/>
their ſtyle. He was intimately acquainted with modern languages, and through their means, with the improvements of medicine in every country in Europe. Such was the facility with which he acquired a language, and ſo great was his enterpriſe in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearches in medicine, that I once heard him ſpeak of learning the Arabic, for the ſake of reading Avicenna in the original; as if it were a matter of as little difficulty to him, as it was to compoſe a lecture, or to viſit a patient.</p>
            <p>DR. CULLEN'S reading was extenſive, but it was not confined wholly to medicine. He read books upon all ſubjects; and he had a peculiar art of extracting ſomething from all of them which he made ſubſervient to his profeſſion. He was well acquainted with ancient and modern hiſtory, and delighted in the poets, among whom Shakeſpeare was his favourite. The hiſtory of our globe, as unfolded by books of geography and travels, was ſo familiar to him, that a ſtranger could not converſe with him, without ſuppoſing that he had not only travelled, but that he had lived every where. His memory had no rubbiſh in it. Like a ſecretory organ, in the animal body, it rejected every thing in
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:022862_0008_0FBA9C0A18F47938"/>
reading, that could not be applied to ſome uſeful purpoſe. In this he has given the world a moſt valuable leſſon, for the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between error and uſeleſs truth is very ſmall; and a man is no wiſer for knowledge which he cannot apply, than he is rich from poſſeſſing wealth, which he cannot ſpend.</p>
            <p>DR. CULLEN'S knowledge was minute in every branch of medicine. He was an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate anatomiſt, and an ingenious phyſiolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſt. He enlarged the boundaries, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed the utility of Chemiſtry, and thereby prepared the way for the diſcoveries and ſame of his illuſtrious pupil Dr. Black. He ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Materia Medica, of moſt of the errors that had been accumulating in it for two thouſand years, and reduced it to a ſimple and practical ſcience. He was intimately acquainted with all the branches of natural hiſtory and phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy. He had ſtudied every ancient and modern ſyſtem of phyſic. He found the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of Dr. Boerhaave univerſally adopted when he accepted a chair in the Univerſity of Edinburgh. This ſyſtem was founded chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the ſuppoſed preſence of certain acrid particles in the fluids, and in the departure of theſe, in point of conſiſtency, from a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtate. Dr. Cullen's firſt object was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:022862_0009_0FBA9C0B957DB580"/>
the errors of this pathology; and to teach his pupils to ſeek for the cauſes of diſeaſes in the ſolids. Nature is always coy. Ever ſince ſhe was driven from the heart, by the diſcovery of the circulation of the blood, ſhe has concealed herſelf in the brain and nerves. Here ſhe has been purſued by Dr Cullen; and if he has not dragged her to public view, he has left us a clue which muſt in time conduct us to her laſt receſs in the human body. Many, however, of the operations of nature in the nervous ſyſtem have been explained by him; and no candid man will ever explain the whole of them, without acknowledging that the foundation of his ſucceſsful inquiries was laid by the diſcoveries of Dr Cullen.</p>
            <p>HE was intimately acquainted with the hiſtories and diſtinctions of the diſeaſes of all countries, ages, ſtations, occupations, and ſtates of ſociety. While his great object was to explode uſeleſs remedies, he took pains to increaſe the influence of diet, dreſs, air, exerciſe, and the actions of the mind, in medicine. In a word, he was a great practical phyſician; and he has left behind him as many monuments of his ſucceſs in
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:022862_0010_0FBA9C0DB7BC2488"/>
curing diſeaſes, as he has of accuracy and ingenuity in deſcribing their ſymptoms and explaining their cauſes.</p>
            <p>BUT his knowledge was not confined wholly to thoſe ſciences which are intimately connected with medicine. His genius was univerſal, as to natural and artificial ſubjects. He was minutely acquainted with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and practices of all the liberal, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical, and chemical arts; and tradeſmen were often directed by him to new objects of obſervation and improvement in their reſpective occupations. He delighted in the ſtudy of agriculture, and contributed much to excite that taſte for agricultural ſcience, which has of late years ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed the men of genius and leiſure in North-Britain. I have been informed, that he yielded at laſt to that paſſion for rural improvements, which is common to all men, and amuſed himſelf in the evening of his life by cultivating a farm in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of Edinburgh. Happy would it be for the intereſts of agriculture, if phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians in all countries, would imitate Dr. Cullen by an attachment to this noble ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for their previous ſtudies are of ſuch, a nature as frequently to enable them to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:022862_0011_0FBA9C0F51816E18"/>
at improvements in it without experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to apply the experiments of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in the moſt extenſive and pofitable manner.</p>
            <p>DR CULLEN'S publications were few in number compared with his diſcoveries. They conſiſt of his Elements of phyſiology, his Noſologia Methodica, his Firſt Lines of the Practice of Phyſic, an Eſſay upon the cold produced by Evaporation, publiſhed in the ſecond volume of the Phyſical and Literary Eſſays of Edinburgh, a Letter to Lord Cath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cart upon the method of recovering perſons ſuppoſed to be dead from drowning, and a ſyſtem of the Materia Medica. Theſe are all the works which bear his name; but the fruits of his inquiries are to be found in moſt of the medical publications that have appeared in Great Britain within the laſt thirty years. Many of the theſes, publiſhed in Edinburgh during his life, were the vehicles of his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions or practice in medicine; and few of them contained an important or uſeful diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, which was not derived from hints thrown out in his lectures.</p>
            <p>As a TEACHER of medicine, Dr. Cullen poſſeſſed many peculiar talents. He min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled the moſt agreeable eloquence with the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:022862_0012_0FBA9C1444CA5568"/>
moſt profound diſquiſitions. He appeared to <hi>lighten</hi> upon every ſubject upon which he ſpoke. His language was ſimple, and his arrangement methodical, by which means he was always intelligible. From the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he aſcended his chair, he commanded the moſt reſpectful attention from his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pils; inſomuch that I never ſaw one of them diſcover a ſign of impatience during the time of any of his lectures.</p>
            <p>IN the inveſtigation of truth, he ſometimes ventured into the regions of conjecture. His imagination was a hot-bed of hypotheſes, which led him to conſtant obſervation and experiment. Theſe often proved the ſeeds of ſubſequent diſcoveries. It was thus Sir Iſaac Newton founded an empire in ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for moſt of his diſcoveries were the conſequence of preconceived hypotheſes. In delivering new opinions, Dr. Cullen pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the ſtricteſt integrity. I have known him more than once, refute the opinions which he had taught the preceding year, even before the fallacy of them had been ſuſpected by any of his pupils. Such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of candor often paſs with the vulgar for inſtability; but they are the trueſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtics of a great mind. To be unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:022862_0013_0FBA9C1550C8CC78"/>
ſuppoſes perpetual error, or a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of truth without the uſe of reaſon; but this ſublime act of intuition belongs on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Deity.</p>
            <p>THERE was no tincture of credulity in the mind of Dr. Cullen. He taught his pupils the neceſſity of acquiring "the ſlow conſenting academic doubt." I mention theſe words of the poet with peculiar plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as I find them in my notes of one of his lectures, in which he has delivered rules for judging of the truth of things related as facts; for he frequently remarked, that there were ten falſe facts (if the expreſſion can be allowed) to one falſe opinion in medicine. His Materia Medica abounds with proofs of the truth of this part of his character. With how much caution does he admit the efficacy of medicines, as related in books, or as ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted by his own experience! Who could have expected to have found ſo much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty in the writings of a phyſician in the 77th year of his age? But let it be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, that this phyſician was Dr. Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len; and that he always preferred utility to novelty, and loved truth more than fame.</p>
            <p>HE took great pains to deliver his pupils from the undue influence which antiquity
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:022862_0014_0FBA9C172DEEE940"/>
and great names are apt to have upon the human mind. He deſtroyed the ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous veneration which had been paid for many ages to the names of Hippocrates, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, and other ancient authors, and inſpired his pupils with a juſt eſtimate of the writings of modern phyſicians. His conſtant aim was to produce in their minds a change from a paſſive to an active ſtate; and to force upon them ſuch habits of thinking, and obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as ſhould enable them to inſtruct them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>As he admitted no truth without examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, ſo he ſubmitted to no cuſtom in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating it that was not reaſonable. He had a principal ſhare in the merit of deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing medicine from the fetters of the Latin, and introducing the Engliſh language, as the vehicle of public inſtruction in the univerſity of Edinburgh. Much of the ſucceſs of the revolution he effected in medicine, I believe, may be aſcribed to this circumſtance. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the many improvements which have lately been made in medicine, in the Britiſh dominions, may likewiſe be aſcribed to the preſent faſhionable cuſtom of communicating medical knowledge in the Engliſh language. By this means, our ſcience has excited the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:022862_0015_0FBA9C18578A13C8"/>
notice and inquiries of ingenious and obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men in all profeſſions, and thereby a kind of galaxy has been created in the hemiſphere of medicine. By aſſuming an Engliſh dreſs, it has moreover been prepared more eaſily to aſſociate with other ſciences; from each of which it has received aſſiſtance and ſupport.</p>
            <p>IN his intercourſe with his pupils Dr. Cullen was truly kind and affectionate. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have I known a man who poſſeſſed in a higher degree thoſe qualities which ſeize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every affection of the heart. He knew the rare and happy arts, as circumſtances required, of being affable, without being ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable; ſociable without being familiar; and familiar, without loſing a particle of reſpect. Such was the intereſt he took in the health, ſtudies, and future eſtabliſhment of all his pupils, that each of them believed that he poſſeſſed a pre-eminence in his friendſhip; while the equal diffuſion of his kind offices proved that he was the common friend and father of them all. Sometimes he would lay aſide the diſta<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>, without leſſening the dignity of the profeſſor, and mix with his pupils at his table upon terms of the moſt endearing equality. Upon theſe occaſions his ſocial affections ſeemed to have an
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:022862_0016_0FBA9C1CD43A19C0"/>
influence upon his mind. Science, ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and convivial humor, appeared for hours together to ſtrive which ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominate in his converſation. I appeal to you, gentlemen, who have ſhared in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which I have deſcribed, for the juſtice of the picture which I have drawn of him at his hoſpitable table. You will recollect, with me, how agreeably he accommodated himſelf to our different capacities and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers; how kindly he diſſipated our youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful bluſhes, by inviting us to aſk him queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and how much he taught us, by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, of the nature of the ſoil, climate, products, and diſeaſes of even our own country.</p>
            <p>FROM the hiſtory that has been given of Dr. Cullen, we ſhall not be ſurpriſed at the reputation which he gave to the univerſity of Edinburgh, for upwards of thirty years. The city of Edinburgh during his life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the very atmoſphere of medicine. But let me not here be unjuſt to the merits of his illuſtrious colleagues. The names of Whytt, Rutherford, the Monroes, Black, the Gregories, Hope, and Home, will always be dear to the lovers of medical ſcience. May every healing plant bloom upon the graves
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:022862_0017_0FBA9C1F6BFBFAB0"/>
of thoſe of them who are departed! and may thoſe who have ſurvived him, together with their new aſſociate, the learned and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Dr. Duncan, long continue to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the honor, of that juſtly celebrated ſchool of medicine!</p>
            <p>IT remains now that I add a ſhort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Dr. Cullen's conduct as a phyſician and a man.</p>
            <p>IN his attendance upon his patients, he made their health his firſt object, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by confirmed a line between the mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and liberal profeſſions; for while wealth is purſued by the former, as the end of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, it ſhould be left by the latter to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the more noble exertions of the mind. So gentle and ſympathizing was Dr. Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len's manner in a ſick room, that pain and diſtreſs ſeemed to be ſuſpended in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Hope followed his footſteps, and death appeared frequently to drop his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion in a combat with his ſkill. He was compaſſionate and charitable to the poor; and from his pupils, who conſulted him in ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he conſtantly refuſed to receive any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniary ſatisfaction for his ſervices.</p>
            <p>IN his intercourſe with the world he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited the manners of a well-bred gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:022862_0018_0FBA9C2097838030"/>
He exerciſed upon all occaſions the agreeable art, in which true politeneſs is ſaid to conſiſt, of ſpeaking with civility, and liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with attention to to every body. His converſation was at all times animated, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable, and inſtructing. Few perſons went into his company without learning ſomething; and even a common thought, by paſſing through his mind, received an impreſſion, which made it ever afterwards worthy of being preſerved.</p>
            <p>HE was a ſtrict oeconomiſt of time. He ſeldom went out of his houſe in his carriage, or a ſedan chair, without a book in his hand; and he once told me that he frequently em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed one of his ſons to read to him after he went to bed, that he might not loſe that portion of time which paſſes between lying down and falling aſleep.</p>
            <p>HE was remarkably punctual to all his profeſſional engagements. He appeared to conſider time as a ſpecies of property, which no man had a right to to take from another without his conſent.</p>
            <p>IT was by means of his oeconomy and punctuality in the uſe of time, that he accompliſhed ſo much in his profeſſion. I have read of ſome men who have ſpent more
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:022862_0019_0FBA9C221DCBCEC0"/>
time in their cloſets, and of others who have done more buſineſs; but I have never read, nor heard of a man, who mingled more ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and buſineſs together. He lived by rule, without ſubjecting himſelf to the ſlavery of forms. He was always employed, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in a hurry; and amidſt the numerous and complicated avocations of ſtudy and buſineſs, he appeared to enjoy the pleaſures of ſociety, as if company-keeping and converſation were the only buſineſs of his life.</p>
            <p>I ſhall mention but one more trait in the character of Dr. Cullen, and that is, that he was diſtinguiſhed by no one ſingularity of behaviour from other men. It is true he ſtood alone; but this ſingularity was occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, not by his quitting the ſociety of his fellow-men by walking on their left, or right ſide, but by his walking before them. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centricities in behaviour are the offspring of a lively fancy only, but order is inſeparably connected with real genius. The actions of the former may be compared to the crooked flaſh of diſtant lightning, while the latter reſembles in its movements the ſteady revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of the heavenly bodies.</p>
            <p>IN reviewing the character which has been given of Dr. Cullen, I am forced to make a ſhort
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:022862_0020_0FBA9C239528B7B0"/>
digreſſion, while I do homage to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of phyſic by a ſingle remark. So great are the bleſſings which mankind derive from it, that if every other argument failed to prove the adminiſtration of a Providence in human affairs, the profeſſion of medicine alone would be ſufficient for that purpoſe. Who can think of the talents, virtues, and ſervices of Dr. Cullen, without believing that the Creator of the world delights in the happineſs of his creatures, and that his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mercies are over all his works!</p>
            <p>FOR the information of ſuch of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of our college as have not ſeen Dr. Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, it may not be improper to add the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing deſcription of his perſon. He was tall, ſlender, and had a ſtoop in his ſhoulders; his face was long; his under lip protruded a little beyond the upper; his noſe was large, and inclined to a point downwards; his eye, which was of a blue color, was pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating but ſoft; and over his whole face was diffuſed an air of mildneſs and thought, which was ſtrongly characteriſtic of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant temper and operations of his mind.</p>
            <p>IT pleaſed God to prolong his life to a good old age. He lived near 78 years. He lived to ſhew the different nature of the ſoul
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:022862_0021_0FBA9C2511BD36C8"/>
and body, by the increaſing vigor of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, under the gradual decay of the latter. He lived to demonſtrate how much the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all the faculties of the mind de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon their conſtant exerciſe. He liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to teach his brethren by his example, that the obligations to acquire and communicate knowledge, ſhould ceaſe only with health or life; and laſtly, he lived to reap the fruits of his labors in the moſt extenſive fame; for not only his pupils, and his works, had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed his reputation; but canvaſs, paper, and clay, had borne even the image of his perſon to every quarter of the globe.</p>
            <p>THE public papers, as well as private letters, inform us, that he ſurvived his uſefulneſs only a few months. He reſigned his profeſſorſhip in the autumn of 1789, on account of bodily weakneſs, and died in the month of January of the preſent year; a year fatal to the pride of man; for this year Franklin and Howard, as well as Cullen, have mingled with the duſt. During the interval between his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation and his death he received the moſt affectionate marks of public and private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. The city of Edinburgh voted him their thanks, and preſented him with a piece of plate. This inſtance of public gratitude
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:022862_0022_0FBA9C2999B26E20"/>
deſerves our particular attention; as it is more common for cities to treat their eminent lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary characters with neglect during their lives, and centuries afterwards to contend for the honor of having given them birth. The different medical ſocieties of Edinburgh followed him to his chamber with addreſſes full of gratitude and affection. In mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe facts, I am led to contemplate the venerable ſubject of our praiſes in a ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation truly ſolemn and intereſting. How pregnant with inſtruction is the death-bed of a phyſician, who has ſpent a long life in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive and ſucceſsful practice! If the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows we have relieved are the ſureſt ſupport in our own, how great muſt have been the conſolation which Dr. Cullen derived, in his laſt hours, from a review of his active and uſeful life! How many fathers and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, huſbands and wives, brothers and ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whoſe tears he had wiped away by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the ſtroke of death from the objects of their affections, muſt have preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to his imagination, and ſoothed his ſoul with grateful prayers for his eternal wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare! But the retroſpect of the ſervices he had rendered to his fellow-creatures, was not confined to the limits of his extenſive buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:022862_0023_0FBA9C2C96CAB780"/>
in the city of Edinburgh. While the illuſtrious actions of moſt men may be view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a naked eye, the atchievments of Dr. Cullen, in the diſtant regions of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſcience, can only be perceived by the help of a teleſcope. Let us apply this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to diſcover his exploits of benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence in every quarter of the world. He had filled the capitals, and moſt of the towns of Great-Britain and Ireland with eminent phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians. Many of his pupils had arrived at the firſt honors in their profeſſion in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal cities on the continent of Europe. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them had extended the bleſſings of his improvements in the principles and practice of medicine, to every Britiſh ſettlement in the Eaſt and Weſt Indies, and to every free ſtate in America. But the ſum of his uſefulneſs did not end here. He had taught the different profeſſors in the College of Philadelphia, and in the Univerſity of Pennſylvania, the art of teaching others the moſt ſucceſsful methods of curing diſeaſes, and thereby he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed the benefits of his diſcoveries into every part of the United States. How great was the maſs of ſuch accumulated beneficence! and how ſublime muſt have been the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:022862_0024_0FBA9C2E2BCD39F0"/>
which the review of it created in his mind! Had it been poſſible for the merit of ſuch extenſive and complicated ſervices to mankind to have reſcued one mortal from the grave, Dr. Cullen had never died. But the decree of death is univerſal, and even the healing art, is finally of no effect in ſaving the lives of thoſe who have exerciſed it with the moſt ſucceſs in ſaving the lives of others.</p>
            <p>Dr. CULLEN is now no more. What a blank has been produced by his death in the great volume of Science! Behold! The genius of humanity weeping at his feet, while the genius of medicine lifts up the key, which fell from his hand with his laſt breath, and with inexpreſſible concern, cries out, "To whom ſhall I give this inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Who now will unlock for me the treaſures of univerſal nature?"</p>
            <p>VENERABLE Shades, adieu! What tho' thy American pupils were denied the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly pleaſure of following thee from thy Profeſſors-chair to thy ſick-bed, with their effuſions of gratitude, and praiſe! What tho' we did not ſhare in the grief of thy fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral obſequies, and though we ſhall never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dew with our tears the ſplendid monument which thy affectionate and grateful Britiſh
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:022862_0025_0FBA9C2FCCBFA048"/>
pupils have decreed for thee in the metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis of thy native country; yet the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of thy talents and virtues, ſhall be preſerved in each of our boſoms, and never ſhall we return in triumph from beholding the efficacy of medicine in curing a diſeaſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feeling our obligations for the inſtructions we have derived from thee!</p>
            <p>I repeat it again, Dr. Cullen is now no more—No more, I mean, a pillar and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of an ancient ſeat of ſcience—no more, the delight and admiration of his pupils—no more the luminary of medicine to half the globe—no more, the friend and benefactor of mankind.—But I would as ſoon believe that our ſolar ſyſtem was created only to amuſe and periſh like a rocket, as believe that a mind endowed with ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe powers of action and contemplation had ceaſed to exiſt. Reaſon bids us hope that he yet LIVES—And Revelation ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles us to ſay, with certainty and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that he ſtill LIVES.—Fain would I lift the curtain which ſeparates eternity from time, and inquire, what are now his ſtudies and employments—But it is not for mortals to pry into the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of the inviſible world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:022862_0026_0FBA9C3151A44BE0"/>
SUCH was the man whoſe memory we have endeavoured to celebrate. He lived for our benefit. It remains only that we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the event of his death in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that he may die for our benefit likewiſe. For this purpoſe I ſhall finiſh our Eulogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um with the following obſervations.</p>
            <p>I. LET us learn from the character of Dr. Cullen duly to eſtimate our profeſſion. While Aſtronomy claims a Newton, and Electricity a Franklin, Medicine has been equally ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by having employed the genius of a Cullen. Whenever therefore we feel our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves diſpoſed to relax in our ſtudies, to uſe our profeſſion for ſelfiſh purpoſes, or to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect the poor, let us recollect how much we leſſen the dignity which Dr. Cullen has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon our profeſſion.</p>
            <p>II. BY the death of Dr. Cullen the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public of medicine has loſt one of its moſt diſtinguiſhed and uſeful members. It is incumbent upon us therefore to double our diligence in order to ſupply the loſs of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable fellow-citizen. That phyſician has lived to little purpoſe, who does not leave his profeſſion in a more improved ſtate than he found it. Let us remember, that our obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to add ſomething to the capital of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:022862_0027_0FBA9C364617CC98"/>
knowledge, areequally binding with our obligations to practiſe the virtues of integrity and humanity in our intercourſe with our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients. Let no uſeful fact therefore, however inconſiderable it may appear, be kept back from the public eye; for there are mites in ſcience as well as in charity, and the remote conſequences of both are often alike impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and beneficial. Facts are the morality of medicine. They are the ſame in all ages and in all countries. They have preſerved the works of the immortal Sydenham from being deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their mixture with his abſurd theories; and under all the revolutions in ſyſtems that will probably take place hereafter, the facts which are contained in Dr. Cullen's works, will conſtitute the beſt ſecurity for their ſafe and grateful reception by future ages.</p>
            <p>III. HUMAN nature is ever prone to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes. While we celebrate the praiſes of Dr. Cullen, let us take care leſt we check a ſpirit of free inquiry, by too great a regard for his authority in medicine. I well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member an obſervation ſuited to our preſent purpoſe, which he delivered in his introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a courſe of lectures on the inſtitutes of medicine in the year 1766. After ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:022862_0028_0FBA9C3710E516A8"/>
of the long continued and extenſive em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of Galen in the ſchools of phyſic, he ſaid, <q>It is a great diſadvantage to any ſcience to have been improved by a great man. His authority impoſes indolence, timidity, or idolatry upon all who come after him.</q>—Let us avoid theſe evils in our veneration for Dr. Cullen. To believe in great men, is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as great an obſtacle to the progreſs of knowledge, as to believe in witches and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurers. It is the image worſhip of ſcience; for error is as much an attribute of man, as the deſire of happineſs; and I think I have obſerved, that the errors of great men partake of the dimenſions of their minds, and are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of a greater magnitude than the errors of men of inferior underſtanding. Dr. Brown has proved the imperfection of human geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, by extending ſome parts of Dr. Cullen's ſyſtem of phyſic, and perhaps by correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſome of its defects. But he has left much to be done by his ſucceſſors. He has even bequeathed to them the labor of remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the errors he has introduced into medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine by his neglect of an important principle in the animal oeconomy, and by his ignorance of the hiſtories and ſymptoms of diſeaſes. Perhaps no ſyſtem of medicine can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:022862_0029_0FBA9C38B3524670"/>
while there exiſts a ſingle diſeaſe which we do not know, or cannot cure. If this be true, then a complete ſyſtem of medicine can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be formed, till America has furniſhed deſcriptions and cures of all her peculiar diſeaſes. The United States have perfected the ſcience of civil government. The free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of our conſtitutions, by imparting vigor and independence to the mind, is favourable to bold and original thinking upon all ſubjects. Let us avail ourſelves therefore of this politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal aid to our reſearches, and endeavour to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hiſtories and cures of all our diſeaſes, that we may thereby contribute our part towards the formation of a complete ſyſtem of medicine. As a religion of ſome kind is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to promote morals; ſo ſyſtems of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine of ſome kind, are equally neceſſary to produce a regular mode of practice. They are not only neceſſary, but unavoidable in medicine; for no phyſician, nay more, no empiric, practiſes without them.</p>
            <p>THE preſent is an age of great improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. While the application of reaſon to the ſciences of government and religion, is daily meliorating the condition of mankind, it is agreeable to obſerve the influence or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:022862_0030_0FBA9C3A5CBB1270"/>
in leſſening human miſery, by aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the mortality or violence of many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. The decrees of heaven appear to be fulfilling by natural means; and if no ancient prophecies had declared it, the late nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous diſcoveries in medicine would authorize us to ſay, that the time is approaching, when not only tyranny, diſcord and ſuperſtition ſhall ceaſe from our world, but when diſeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es ſhall be unknown, or ceaſe to be incurable; and when old age ſhall be the only outlet of human life.</p>
