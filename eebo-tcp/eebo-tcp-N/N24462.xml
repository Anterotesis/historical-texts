            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>1 TIMOTHY iv.8.</bibl>
               <q>—GODLINESS is profitable unto all things, having prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN all ſituations and conditions of life, true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is of the firſt importance. It is the ſolace of thoſe, who are placed in the vale of poverty and affliction; the ſweetener of all the unambitious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, of the middle walks of private life; and the higheſt ornament to the perſons, and characters of the rich, the honorable, and the great. Without it, no man can be either truly, or laſtingly happy. Were this divine gueſt to be baniſhed from the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of men, this world would become but the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode of folly and wretchedneſs; and man, with all his boaſted reaſon and ſuperiority, inferior, in point of real enjoyment, to the herds who graze the fields.</p>
            <p>THE ſentiments of St. Paul on this ſubject, are clearly expreſſed in our text and context. After cautioning Timothy to avoid perplexing himſelf and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:032377_0005_0FF2033B5616B190"/>
others, with the fabulous traditions of the Jews, and their endleſs genealogies, and exhorting him, like the athleticks in the Grecian games, to exert his utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt labor and diligence, in purſuing and promoting the doctrines and duties of true piety, as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to enforce the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hole he introduces the words of our text. <hi>Godlineſs is profitable unto all things, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THESE motives to godlineſs, though firſt addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Timothy, apply with equal force and propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety to all men, of every age and condition. The import of the text is briefly <hi>this,</hi> "Godlineſs is ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery way advantageous. Whoever ſhall experience the power of it, will thence derive a rich harveſt of gain. Beſide the crown of immortal glory, which it infallibly ſecures to its poſſeſſor, it will produce the higheſt ſatisfaction, of which the human mind is capable, in the preſent ſtate of exiſtence. Its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages are eminent in all ſtations, and ſituations, and in the proſecution of every buſineſs, proper to engage the attention of mankind."</p>
            <p>IF then godlineſs have promiſes of good to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed in this life, as well as in that which is to come, if it be profitable unto <hi>all things,</hi> we may doubtleſs with ſafety conclude, that effectual aid may be deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from it, in the adminiſtration of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that, if generally and faithfully prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, it would moſt eſſentially contribute toward obtaining for, and ſecuring to a community, all the important ends of its inſtitution.</p>
            <p>To illuſtrate <hi>this obſervation,</hi> is the propoſed ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the preſent diſcourſe. Preparatory to which, a conciſe view of the nature of godlineſs, and of the ends of civil government will firſt be taken.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:032377_0006_0FF20361B4B6ACB8"/>GODLINESS is a term uſed in two ſenſes; the one limited, and the other more general. In its limited ſenſe, it includes only the duties of piety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God. In its general ſenſe, it compriſes all the duties preſcribed by the chriſtian religion; thoſe which we owe to our fellow-men, and to ourſelves, as well as thoſe which we owe to God. The apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, in our text, uſes the term in its moſt general ſenſe, as appears from the extenſive benefits, which, he aſſures us, will flow from a faithful practice of its various duties. Theſe duties cannot now be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutely detailed. It may however be proper to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in general, that they may be divided into four claſſes, the duties we owe to God, to Chriſt, to our fellow-men, and to ourſelves.</p>
            <p>IN the firſt of theſe, are compriſed ſupreme love to God, a fixed dependance on, and a humble truſt in him, a cordial ſubmiſſion to his providential diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, together with conformity to his revealed will.</p>
            <p>IN the ſecond, are included faith in the mediator, accompanied with a daily and ſincere attention to him, conſidered as our teacher, our example and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, our advocate and interceſſor with the father.</p>
            <p>IN the third, are contained univerſal love to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, mercy, juſtice, beneficence, truth and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of injuries.</p>
            <p>THE fourth, comprehends the graces of humility, meekneſs, prudence, fortitude and ſelf-government.</p>
            <p>ALL the before mentioned virtues are briefly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, by our divine maſter, in the following expreſſive words. "Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and thy neighbour as thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf" <hi>Theſe</hi> unitedly conſtitute that godlineſs, which
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:032377_0007_0FF2037B05DE4DD8"/>is urged on us in our text, as being every way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to the advancement, of all the important in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of mankind.</p>
            <p>BUT in order to determine, how far godlineſs contributes to the obtainment of the great ends of civil inſtitutions, it will be neceſſary to enquire what thoſe ends are? Or what are the great objects, all governments ought to purſue, and which all good governments actually do purſue, though with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent degrees of ſucceſs? Theſe, it is ſuppoſed, may be all comprehended in the following particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE primary object of civil inſtitutions is to prevent thoſe evils, which, conſidering the deprav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of mankind, would certainly reſult from a ſtate of nature.</p>
            <p>SELFISHNESS is the predominant principle of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len man. This, by being ſupreme, neceſſarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the fear of God, and benevolence to our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-men. And among a number of individuals, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united by any ſocial compact, would produce a ſtate of conſtant mutual hoſtility. In ſuch a ſituation, jarring intereſts would at once enkindle the fire, and conſtantly fan the flame of diſcord; and of courſe baniſh peace and ſecurity. No protection, except what may be derived from perſonal proweſs, can be obtained by individuals, in a ſtate of nature. Life and property are equally inſecure. Indeed without ſome kind of civil aſſociation, the laſt muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely limited. The power of an individual, unaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by thoſe arts, which flouriſh only under the protection of civil government, is wholly incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to the acquiſition of more property, than a bare ſufficiency for a ſcanty ſubſiſtence. But admitting the poſſibility of acquiring conſiderable property in a ſtate of nature, ſtill it would only ſerve to invite plunder, and lawleſs invaſion. The more one poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:032377_0008_0FF20377370E7B80"/>the greater would be his danger. And if his ſtrength ſhould prove ſufficient, to reſiſt a ſingle invader, it muſt unavoidably yield to the ſuperior force of a combination of thoſe, who would chooſe to live by rapine, rather than ſubmit to the toils of daily labor.</p>
            <p>THE evils to which men would unavoidably be expoſed, in a ſtate of nature, we may learn from thoſe, which have ever been attendant on revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. During ſuch changes there is ever a period, in which laws loſe their influence, and licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs prevails. This reign of anarchy is at its moſt alarming criſis, in that ſtage of a revolution which intervenes, between the deſtruction of the old, and the eſtabliſhment of new principles and maxims of government. It is probable that no revolution was ever effected in any country, with leſs of theſe evils, than the recent one here in America. In our own State, very few diſorders appeared; owing perhaps principally to the inconſiderable alterations, which the revolution produced. But in ſome parts of the union, the moſt fatal evils were experienced. Law was no longer a reſtraint, right no longer regarded, property was invaded, virtue inſulted, chaſtity pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted, and life ſacrificed, by abandoned ruffians, who, having broken over every reſtraint, rioted on the ſpoils of their innocent neighbours. Under an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſibly more dreadful experience of theſe, and many other ſimilar evils, it is well known, one of the principal kingdoms of Europe, has for ſeveral years been groaning.</p>
            <p>THESE things have been mentioned, ſolely with a view of exhibiting a ſpecimen of what may be expected from a ſtate of nature. To prevent their exiſtence, as far as poſſible, to ſecure to individuals the peaceable poſſeſſion of life, liberty and property,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:032377_0009_0FF1D5E06147ED90"/>is a primary object of civil government. And its tendency to accompliſh this purpoſe, undoubtedly wrought a coviction of its abſolute neceſſity, in the minds of men, in the early ages of the world.</p>
            <p n="2">2. ANOTHER object worthy of the purſuit of government, is the promotion of the greateſt good of the whole community, ſo far as that may be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, without injury done to others.</p>
            <p>PRIVATE intereſt, or the good of an individual, farther than it may be conſidered as involved in the good of the whole, ought not to be, and cannot conſiſtently be the object of the ſocial compact. As the whole is greater than its parts, ſo the good of a community is greater than the private intereſt of any individual. And to cauſe a greater intereſt to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, for the purpoſe of advancing a leſs, is a violation of the order of nature, and of the laws of equity and reaſon. A community is but one great family; in which, every member ought to consider his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, as involved in that of the whole; and this whole ought to ſwallow up every private or detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed intereſt. As no private family can be happy, where each member is actuated ſolely by a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of ſelf-gratification; as ſuch a line of conduct will produce a conſtant claſhing of intereſts, which will unavoidably iſſue in contention and animoſity; ſo no ſtate can enjoy political happineſs, where the public good is neglected, and an attachment to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, becomes the ruling paſſion. Hence cabals are always injurious, and ought to be oppoſed and even deſpiſed, as deſtructive of the great ends of civil ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. They invariably have for their object, ſome party deſign. And the ſetting up of ſuch an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt as the principal object of purſuit, is in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, hoſtile to public good. Private emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot be ſet in competition with public, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out endangering the latter. And to endanger the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:032377_0010_0FF2033D189AB8A8"/>public good, for any private advantage, is always to ſacrifice the greater intereſt to the leſs.</p>
            <p>FROM theſe obſervations it appears, that the good which ought to be the object of government is the public good; and that in competition with it, no private or party intereſt ought ever to be placed.</p>
            <p>BUT it is further to be obſerved, that although the greateſt good of a community, ought to be the leading object of its government, yet even <hi>this</hi> is not to be purſued, by ſuch meaſures as are injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to other communities. Although the intereſt of an individual may be ſacrificed, where it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to promote the greateſt good of the public, of which he is a member; yet it by no means follows, that a ſtate or kingdom, in order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote its own advantage, poſſeſſes a right to adopt ſuch meaſures, as are injurious to a ſiſter ſtate. It is as inconſiſtent with every rule of moral obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for one ſtate to commit injuſtice againſt anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as it is for an individual to rob or plunder his neighbour. All mankind are brethren, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the ſame common parent. Different ſtates are correlatives of each other. The great chriſtian law which preſcribes our duty toward our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, conſidered in our individual capacity, will, if obſerved, regulate the conduct of ſtates toward each other.</p>
            <p>ALTHOUGH politicians have burdened the ſcience of government, with many intricacies, which may, not improperly, be called the chicanery of courts; yet, if inexperience may be permitted to riſk an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, we ſhould ſay that it is reducible to a few plain principles. To love our neighbour as our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves—To do to others as we would that they ſhould do to us, are rules of moral conduct as appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to communities, as to individuals. Nor can
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:032377_0011_0FF2031CB1E861E8"/>any reaſon be aſſigned in juſtification of fraud, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, oppreſſion, or cruelty in a body of men, more than in a ſingle perſon. On the contrary, where a body of men practiſe injuſtice, the crime is far greater, than a ſimilar act of injuſtice performed by an individual: becauſe in the one caſe, the guilt is confined to a ſingle ſubject, and in the other, it extends to a whole community; and becauſe the evil conſequences of public injuſtice, and the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries done by it, are far more extenſive, than thoſe of private. When one nation is guilty of injuſtice towards another, thouſands and millions may feel the injury. It is not in human power to calculate the evils, which will follow one deliberate act of ſuch injuſtice. It will be readily granted, that the evils of private injuſtice are many. Among theſe may be enumerated expenſive law-ſuits, the diſaffection of families to each other, and all the uſual conſequences of private hatred. Yet admitting the worſt that can follow, the civil law is a barrier, which will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways check and reſtrain theſe evils, and confine them within certain limits. But when one nation practiſes groſs injuſtice againſt another, there is no common arbiter, either to decide the contention, or to control its deſtructive effects. War commonly burſts forth like a ſweeping deluge, overwhelming and confounding the innocent with the guilty; and inflicting on whole countries greater, and more du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable calamities, than any of the uſual ſcourges, by which heaven corrects the madneſs of mankind.</p>
            <p>THE foregoing obſervations ſufficiently prove, that national injuſtice is far more criminal in itſelf, and far more fatal in its conſequences, than private. And of conſequence, that the ſame moral rule of righteouſneſs, which the ſcriptures have preſcribed to individuals, and by which they are bound to reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulate their conduct, ought to be adopted by nations, and faithfully adhered to, in all their treatment of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:032377_0012_0FF2037EA1425BC8"/>each other. Hence will appear the juſtice of the remark before made, that although the greateſt public good of a community, ought to be the end of its government, yet even that object, great and important as it is, ought never to be purſued, by means, which involve in them, a violation of the rights of other nations.</p>
            <p>BUT notwithſtanding the evident truth of this remark, it is to be lamented, that a policy directly repugnant to the rules of moral juſtice, has been too prevalent among all nations. The Roman love of their country, ſo much the boaſt of her citizens and ſo highly celebrated by her beſt writers, even in the pureſt days of that republic, was but a ſelfiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted principle. Its object was the aggrandize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their commonwealth, not only without any regard to the happineſs of other nations, but at the expenſe of their liberties, privileges and independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Their love of their country, led them to deſtroy, or at leaſt to ſubjugate every neighbouring ſtate, which ſtood in the way of the enlargement of their empire, or whoſe intereſt was inconſiſtent with their own ambitious views. Juſtly were they char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acterized by the ſpirit of propheſy as <hi>a beaſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and terrible, and ſtrong exceedingly; as devouring and breaking in pieces, and ſtamping the reſidue with their feet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is with the deepeſt regret, that truth obliges us to confeſs, that too ſimilar to this deteſtable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, has been the policy of modern, as well as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient nations. While the rulers of kingdoms have been careful to inculcate mutual juſtice among their ſubjects, by wiſe and ſalutary laws, they appear to have forgotten that national juſtice is a virtue; or not to be ſenſible, that there is any thing criminal in injuring a neighbouring ſtate, where the power of doing it is poſſeſſed, and an opportunity offered.
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:032377_0013_0FF20322B6073CE0"/>While the private robber, who forces from an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual a ſmall ſum, muſt expiate his crime on a gibbet, it has been but too common for one nation to rob another of whole provinces, not only without cenſure, but with a tribute of praiſe for their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialy atchievments. To this fatal ſource, the injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of nations toward each other, is to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted the awful ſcourge of war, with all its dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful calamities. If the cauſe could once be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, the effect would ceaſe; and the prophecy of univerſal peace, ſo frequently repeated in the ſacred writings, meet with an immediate accompliſhment. The inſtruments of war would then be converted into implements of huſbandry; nation would not lift up ſword againſt nation, nor would they learn war any more.</p>
            <p>THESE few remarks on national injuſtice have been made, to call to the minds of this audience, the evils, which muſt neceſſarily reſult from the prevalency of that unjuſt policy, which leads a nation to advance her own intereſt, by acts of injuſtice done to others. And likewiſe for the purpoſe of explaining in what ſenſe, the public good ought to be the object of political inſtitutions. To avoid the evils of a ſtate of nature, and to promote the greateſt national happineſs, have been mentioned as the proper ends of government. Theſe, are conſidered as including not only the particular ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which have been brought up to view in what has been ſaid, but whatever tends to the proſperity of a nation.</p>
            <p>WE will now proceed to enquire, what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, in the purſuit of theſe ends, may be derived from the practice of godlineſs.</p>
            <p n="1">1. GODLINESS will be productive of national fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, by ſecuring the fidelity of rulers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:032377_0014_0FF20328751858A0"/>THAT national happineſs and miſery, are cloſely connected with the character and conduct of thoſe who hold the reins of government, approaches nigh to a ſelf-evident propoſition. At leaſt it is a truth which a very little argumentation will ſupport, and which has been fully confirmed by all hiſtory, both ſacred and profane. The government of an Ahab, and a Manaſſeh, of a Nero and a Caligula, afford unequivocal proofs of the miſery of a people, deſtined to endure the ſcourge of wicked and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical rulers. "When the righteous are in author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, the people rejoice, but when the wicked bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth rule, the people mourn." An unprincipled magiſtrate is regardleſs of the public good, and wholly under the influence of ſelfiſh and mercenary views. In ſuch hands neither the property, the lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty nor the life of the people are ſecure. <hi>Theſe</hi> may, and moſt probably often will be ſacrificed to the luſt, the ambition, the avarice, and even the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price of the tyrant. The public good is unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably too precious a depoſite, to be betruſted to ſuch men. He who diſregards the obligations he is under to his God, cannot be ſuppoſed ſuitably to feel thoſe which he is under to his fellow men. He will rather be led to conſider his exaltation to office, as rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him above the reſtraints, laid upon his unofficed brethren, and as affording him an opportunity for indulging with impunity, the ſelfiſhneſs and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of his heart. A ruler deſtitute of virtue, will without doubt in a greater or leſs degree be guilty of malepractice. And a government badly admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtered, will produce evils introductory, both to public and private infelicity. There is an inſepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able connexion between the moral character of rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and their adminiſtrations. If the former be vicious, corruption will appear in the latter, and a corrupted adminiſtration militates againſt the very ends of the ſocial compact. And of courſe is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the happineſs of a community.—
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032377_0015_0FF2032A51922758"/>The liberties of a nation are always extremely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe, in the hands of vicious rulers; and the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which nations have ſuffered under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch characters, are to be ranked with the heavieſt of divine judgments.</p>
            <p>IF then vice in authority be deſtructive of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic felicity, it is but rational to conclude that vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue exalted to power, muſt be productive of directly contrary effects; and that a pious magiſtracy muſt afford the moſt encouraging proſpect, of national happineſs. The magiſtrate, who to the natural and acquired abilities neceſſary to prepare him for office, adds the fear of God, a reverence for the dictates of his own conſcience, and that love to his fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, implied in true godlineſs, will not fail to make the good of his conſtituents, the ultimate object of his political purſuits. His example will uniformly be in favor of virtue, and his abilities ſteadily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted to ſupport and maintain that "righteouſneſs which exalteth a nation, and to diſcountenance and ſuppreſs that vice which is a reproach to any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple." As a legiſlator, he will diſregard local preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices and party views, and ever give his voice in favor of ſuch laws, as he believes to be founded in juſtice and public utility; and oppoſe with firmneſs, and uncorruptible integrity thoſe of an oppoſite tendency. As a judge, his deciſions will be guided by law and equity, without partiality for, or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice againſt any man. In whatever ſtation he is called to ſerve his country, he will remember that he is accountable for his conduct not only to his fellow citizens, but to the ſupreme ruler of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; that he has a moſt important truſt commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him; that he is a miniſter of God, for good to his people; that the primary deſign to his hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orary appointment, was to capacitate him to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all his talents, in promoting and diffuſing happineſs through the community; and that he
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:032377_0016_0FF2032C32A02CB0"/>anſwers the great end of his being called into office, only ſo far as he ſteadfaſtly purſues this grand ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. And that a greater proportion of happineſs will be enjoyed by a people, where their rulers are actuated by ſuch diſintereſted motives, than where they are influenced by ſelfiſhneſs, is too evident to need proof. It is as unneceſſary to prove, that men of piety are not only the moſt likely to purſue the public good, but the only characters, from whom we have reaſon ſteadily to expect, ſuch diſintereſted conduct. Nothing can afford ſo great a ſecurity for the fidelity of rulers, as godlineſs. Other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives may for a time produce unexceptionable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. But the influence of theſe other motives will be ever uncertain, and at beſt ſubſervient to ſelfiſh views. The public good will always be abandoned by ſuch a mind, whenever it is conſidered as direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſed to private intereſt.</p>
            <p>No men, in any ſituation or employment, are ſo ſenſible of the obligations they are under to fidelity as the truly religious. No others ſo fully perceive its importance, or are ſo deeply impreſſed with a conviction of its neceſſity. Religion is a crown of glory to all who poſſeſs it. It does not of itſelf pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare men for office, either in church or ſtate. But where they are otherways prepared, the addition of true religion, above every thing, contributes to their fidelity and uſefulneſs. This obſervation applies with as much propriety, and force to the civil ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, as to any official characters. Fidelity in that office, is eſſential to national proſperity. So that godlineſs, when it lives and reigns in the hearts and lives of the magiſtrates of a country, contrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utes directly, and moſt eſſentially to the public hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. GODLINESS is no leſs ſalutary to a community, by the influence, which it has on the great body of the people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:032377_0017_0FF203517183C418"/>As it ſecures the fidelity of rulers, ſo it makes good citizens. If its practice could once become univerſal in a nation, it would produce ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in all ranks, as would iſſue in general proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. So far as national happineſs depends, on the promotion of the ſocial virtues—on the cultivation of benevolence, kindneſs, juſtice and charity—on the prevalence of harmony and tranquillity, the practice of godlineſs has a direct tendency to its advancement. Godlineſs teaches us to do juſtly, to love mercy and to walk humbly with God. To owe no man any thing, but to love one another. To render to all their dues, tribute to whom trib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ute, cuſtom to whom cuſtom, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor is due. And, to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the whole in few words, to love our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as ourſelves. So far as theſe virtues promote public happineſs, or are any way conducive to the proſperity of a nation; ſo far the ſalutary influence of godlineſs is indiſputable. As it reſpects the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ſecond table of the law, it conſiſts in the exerciſe of theſe very virtues. And how far the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them actually does contribute to national proſperity, we may learn from the evils which their oppoſite vices never fail to produce. Fraud, injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, anger, wrath and hatred are moſt evidently the bane of ſocial happineſs; and in proportion to their prevalency, are invariably productive of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The practice of theſe virtues then, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of true godlineſs, has a direct tendency to promote the public good.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, ſo far as national happineſs depends on a ſuitable conduct in the members of a community, toward each other, it is directly promoted by godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The circumſtance laſt mentioned, it is well known, has great influence on domeſtic happineſs. It is eſſential to the proſperity of a private family, that the conduct of each member be regulated by
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:032377_0018_0FF203342E72B770"/>the ſtricteſt rules of propriety—that the heads con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct with a dignity becoming their ſtation; equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remote from unreaſonable auſterity on the one hand, and trifling familiarity on the other—that children and ſervants, conſtantly exhibit reverence and reſpect, by an unreſerved and cheerful obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Imprudence and folly in the governors of a family, and obſtinacy and diſobedience in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior members, are utterly deſtructive of domeſtic felicity. And why ſhould not the caſe be the ſame with larger communities? The happineſs of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is compoſed of ſimilar ingredients with that, of a private family. And as the conduct of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral members of the latter, toward each other, has ſo evident an influence on their happineſs, why muſt not the proſperity of a nation be greatly affected, by the mutual conduct of its rulers and ruled? If ſo, godlineſs muſt certainly promote national felicity. For it influences rulers to rule in the fear of God, and unofficered citizens to reverence and reſpect the magiſtrates of their country, as miniſters of the Moſt High, appointed for the good of his people. So far as it extends, it leads every man to conduct agreeable to his ſtation; to abide in, and faithfully to diſcharge the duties of his particular calling, and thus to contribute to the advancement of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral felicity.</p>
            <p>BUT I take the liberty of farther obſerving, that godlineſs promotes national proſperity, as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes to an increaſe of wealth. If any ſhould call in queſtion the truth of this obſervation, let me deſire him to remember, that there are few vices but what are luxurious; that they are expenſive, and even prodigal both of time and money; and that thoſe which are moſt corrupting, which ſpread their contagion the moſt rapidly, which ever have and ever will prevail where godlineſs is neglected, are not only ſuch as devour property, but ſuch as introduce
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:032377_0019_0FF2033ED72C1160"/>diſeaſe, debility, idleneſs, and even an averſion to ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery ſpecies of labor, and thus dry up the very ſources of national wealth.</p>
            <p>ON the other hand, godlineſs leads to temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, health, induſtry and frugality. It not only retrenches the expenſes of extravagance, but it adds to the ſtock already poſſeſſed, the daily gains of diligence. From the command and example of her divine teacher, ſhe gathers up the fragments, and ſuffers nothing to be loſt.</p>
            <p>IF, after conſidering theſe particulars, any ſhould ſtill be diſpoſed to doubt, whether a general diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of godlineſs through a nation, would contrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ute more to the increaſe of its wealth, than the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrained reign of vice, let him compare the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes of the ſeveral virtues included in true godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with thoſe of their oppoſite vices. Let him for inſtance compare the expenſes of humility, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and frugality, with what would be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſupport pride, luxury, intemperance and prod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igality, and the compariſon will convince him, that it is vice which drains a nation of her wealth. We venture further to offer it as a decided opinion, that if ſuch a perſon ſhould judge with impartiality, he would meet a conviction, that the faſhionable vices of the preſent day, are far more expenſive than the ſupport of government, together with all the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic and private means of literary, moral and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious inſtruction. The univerſal ſpread of godlineſs among us, would ſave this enormous expenſe, and thus increaſe the pecuniary advantages of our nation. So true is it that godlineſs is profitable unto <hi>all things,</hi> having promiſe of <hi>the life that now is,</hi> and of that which is to come.</p>
            <p>BUT permit me to add, that godlineſs, above ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery other principle that can be named, gives efficacy
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:032377_0020_0FF20356E6EAFB70"/>to the laws of a nation. Among many other ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, neceſſary to the happineſs of a people, a good code of laws will doubtleſs be included. But ſimply the exiſtence of ſuch a ſyſtem of laws, will be but of little advantage, unleſs they are ſacredly regarded— unleſs they poſſeſs a commanding influence on all ranks of citizens. Laws, that have loſt their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, neither afford protection to the virtuous, nor lay reſtraint on the exceſſes of the vicious. And laws diſregarded and trampled on with impunity will ever loſe their influence. Of conſequence, the ſupport of law, by giving it as extenſive an obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as poſſible, and by putting its penalty in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution on delinquents, muſt be of high importance to national proſperity. And yet no part of civil government is attended with more, or greater diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. Men of true piety will ſee, and feel the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of giving efficacy to laws, and from the pureſt motives, throw their whole weight into that ſcale.—They will obey the ordinances of man for the Lord's ſake. But the vicious part of every community are always impatient under the reſtraints of law; and ready to violate it, whenever they can flatter themſelves of doing it with impunity. Hence the well known fact, that laws are trampled upon, in proportion to the increaſe of vice. The more groſs wickedneſs prevails, the more are all laws di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and human diſregarded. The inference from this fact is plain, that no principle can give ſuch an efficacious influence to the laws of a nation, as true godlineſs. There is a cloſe connection between fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to God, and fidelity to man; he who poſſeſſes the former will not neglect the latter. Conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the diffuſion of true religion through a nation, would in this reſpect, be attended with a moſt happy influence.</p>
            <p>BUT it is worthy of further remark, that godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs not only contributes to the maintenance and
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:032377_0021_0FF20358A141EA80"/>ſupport of law, by its influence on the hearts and lives of its true friends; but the doctrines of reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed religion, have a happy political effect on all who believe them, even with a ſpeculative faith. The corruptions of mankind, it is believed, are far more reſtrained, from an apprehenſion and dread of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture puniſhment, than from all the penalties, which ſanction the ſeveral codes of human laws. Revealed religion denounces future wrath, not only againſt perſons guilty of impiety toward God; but againſt murderers, thieves, adulterers, perjured perſons, and all who commit crimes againſt ſociety. So far as divine revelation is believed—ſo far as it gains even an hiſtorical aſſent from mankind, the idea of this future puniſhment, muſt operate as a forcible check to human corruptions. Theſe penalties, admitting the authenticity of the ſcriptures, are known by the impenitent to be unavoidable, and therefore affect the mind as realities. No concealment, no fraud, no flight, can protect the offender from the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of the judge. If the ſinner dies in impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, he muſt unavoidably ſuffer the dreadful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences. But men can eaſily eſcape the penalties of human laws. Under the beſt executed govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the probability is that they are actually avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in more inſtances, than ſuffered by tranſgreſſors. The means of eſcaping civil puniſhments are very numerous, and perfectly known to the moſt vicious part of every nation. So that human laws are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways tranſgreſſed with a hope of impunity. If then all dread of future puniſhment were totally annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, the ſtrongeſt ſupport of civil law, would be removed, and very little be left to reſtrain the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the vicious. And the conſequence might be an abſolute impoſſibility of ſuppprting civil gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment.</p>
            <p>FROM the foregoing obſervations we may at leaſt conclude, that godlineſs is not only highly advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:032377_0022_0FF2035A6E4926D0"/>but that, a belief of its doctrines, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe which reſpect the divine character and future rewards and 0puniſhments, are eſſential to the well being, if not to the exiſtence of civil ſociety. And it is a well known fact that all antiquity were in favor of a ſimilar ſentiment. Not a ſingle legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator has ever attempted to enforce obedience to his laws, ſolely on the foundation of civil ſanctions. They univerſally perceived the inſufficiency of theſe motives, unaſſiſted by thoſe derived from religion. And as they were ſtrangers to divine revelation, they formed a ſubſtitute, and adapted it, as well as they could, to the circumſtances, the genius, and the prejudices of their people. Lycurgus, Solon, Numa Pompilius, Capac, and every legiſlator, at all famed for the wiſdom of his inſtitutions, found it neceſſary to have recourſe to religion; and, in fact, derived from that ſource, the principle mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to enforce obedience. This ſhows, that in the judgment of theſe eminent men, the belief of a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being, and the practice of ſome religion, are of great importance to the ſupport of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that it is in vain to expect that a ſyſtem of laws can be maintained for any conſiderable pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, independent of all aſſiſtance of this kind. An opinion, as is confidently ſuppoſed, founded in a very accurate, and extenſive knowledge of human nature, and which, we cannot but preſume, will be ever found true, as long as ſinful paſſions and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions poſſeſs ſuch an influence on mankind.</p>
            <p>IF then ſome religion has ever been found neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the exiſtence of civil government; if where the true religion has been unknown, the ableſt le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlators have thought it neceſſary to invent a ſubſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute; if even an hiſtorical belief of the doctrines of revealed religion, have ſo direct a tendency to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port civil inſtitutions; certainly the reality itſelf, the general ſpread of true piety among all ranks in a

commonwealth, muſt be attended with the moſt ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utary effects. Its influence on the order, the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, the peace, and the harmony of a community, cannot fail of augmenting its felicity.</p>
            <p>WE ſee then, that beſide the ſpiritual and eternal advantages of true godlineſs, which the deſign of this diſcourſe will not admit of our conſidering, there are important benefits to be derived from it in the adminiſtration of civil government; and if gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally and faithfully practiſed, it would moſt eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially contribute toward obtaining for, and ſecuring to a community all the valuable ends of ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
            <p>IF the preceding obſervations be juſt, then to maintain, that godlineſs is of no importance in a civil point of view—that gentlemen may be every way as well qualified, to act in any official character, in the government of a nation without, as with reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion—that it is a matter of no conſequence to the political happineſs of a people, what religious ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, or whether any at all prevails among them,—to ſupport theſe, and ſimilar ſentiments, not only tends to the encouragement of immorality, but to the propagation of political hereſy. And in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to their prevalence, muſt be productive of the moſt dangerous conſequences. Without reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, a ſenſe of moral obligation can never be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. And once deſtroy a ſenſe of moral obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and you ſtrike a deadly blow at the root of all mutual confidence between the different members of the community, and invite the ſpread of thoſe vices, which are moſt hoſtile to the political as well as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal intereſt of mankind.</p>
            <p>I FEEL a peculiar happineſs on this occaſion, in being able to confirm theſe ſentiments, by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of that moſt excellent MAN, that BEST OF
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:032377_0024_0FF1D5D72F66C400"/>PATRIOTS, whoſe diſtinguiſhed talents and eminent abilities, faithfully conſecrated to his country's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, have not only in an unexampled manner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared him to his fellow-citizens, but rendered him the object of the veneration of the world. From that valuable legacy of political experience and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, which he bequeathed to his country, in his addreſs accompanying his reſignation, I gladly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce the following paſſages.</p>
            <p>
               <q>OF all the diſpoſitions and habits, ſays he, which lead to political proſperity, religion and morality are indiſpenſible ſupports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotiſm, who ſhould labor to ſubvert theſe great pillars of human happineſs, theſe firmeſt props of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of men and citizens. The mere politician equally with the pious man ought to reſpect and to cheriſh them. A volume could not trace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it ſimply be aſked, where is the ſecurity for property, for reputation, for life, if the ſenſe of religious obligation deſert the oaths, which are the inſtruments of inveſtigation in the courts of juſtice? And let us with caution indulge the ſuppoſition, that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of a peculiar ſtructure; reaſon and experience both forbid us to expect, that national morality can prevail in excluſion of religious principle.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>IT is ſubſtantially true, that virtue or morality is a neceſſary ſpring of popular government. The rule indeed extends with more or leſs force to every ſpecies of free government. Who that is a ſincere friend to it, can look with indifferency on attempts to ſhake the foundation of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bric?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:032377_0025_0FF20337B222BF50"/>I CANNOT conclude this extract, without obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the ſentiments it contains, in the view of every wiſe and good man, muſt add a luſtre to a character, already enrolled on the records of death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs fame, and the ſubject of a more univerſal admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and more extenſive eſteem, than any which the world hath hitherto produced. May America preſerve in everlaſting remembrance his political counſels—may they continue, through all ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generations, the fundamental maxims of their government—may his ſucceſſors be all animated by the ſame ſpirit of wiſdom, patriotiſm, firmneſs, and uncorruptible integrity—may he in the ſhades of retirement be conſtantly bleſſed with the ſpecial tokens of the divine favor—may ſelf-approving re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on the part he has acted, and the ſpiritual joys of communion with God and Chriſt repay the ceaſeleſs toils and anxieties of his public life—and when heaven ſhall call him from his earthly abode, may he be admitted to a diſtinguiſhed ſeat in the paradiſe above.</p>
            <p>PERMIT me to add, that if any thing can conſole us under the painful idea that WASHINGTON, no longer directs the helm of our government, it is the pleaſing reflection that we have for his ſucceſſor, a gentleman, not only of the firſt character for litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and political merit, wiſdom, firmneſs and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency of ſentiment, but one, who in the very moment of his inauguration, and in the preſence of both houſes of our national legiſlature, and a moſt crowded aſſembly of all ranks of ſpectators,<note n="*" place="bottom">See Preſident ADAMS's ſpeech at his inauguration.</note> had the fortitude to avow his attachment to the chriſtian religion, and his fixed determination to conſider a decent reſpect for chriſtianity among the beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendations for the public ſervice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:032377_0026_0FF203448E7504F0"/>BUT we ſuſpend theſe pleaſing reflections, and proceed to remark, that if the obſervations which have been made be juſt, the importance of ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chriſtianity is undeniable. All the political ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efits, which can be rationally expected from any religion ever taught in this world, may certainly be expected from the chriſtian, and in a much higher degree than from any other, in proportion to the ſuperior excellency of its moral precepts. The can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did enemies of our faith confeſs, that the morality taught in the goſpel is the moſt pure, and the beſt adapted to the purpoſes of ſocial happineſs, of any moral ſyſtem ever publiſhed to men. If then ſome religion be neceſſary to anſwer the purpoſes of civil government, chriſtianity even on political views ought to be preferred to all others, as it poſſeſſes far the greateſt tendency to promote the important de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns already mentioned. If its morals are the pureſt, its tendency to promote ſocial happineſs is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and therefore good policy requires its ſupport.</p>
            <p>IT is not however our wiſh that any thing ſimilar to the religious eſtabliſhments of Europe, ſhould be introduced into our country. We hope never to ſee our magiſtrates employed, in preſcribing articles of faith; nor in the exerciſe of the leaſt coercive power to compel men to adopt this, or that creed, or ſubmit to any one mode of worſhip in preference to another. May liberty of conſcience, in this land, be never violated. But if there be important polit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical advantages to be derived from chriſtianity, which cannot be ſo effectually ſecured by any other means, as appears evident from the preceding ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, then is it as much the duty of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to endeavour its preſervation, as in any other way to ſeek the public good. If every individual be left to chooſe for himſelf both with reſpect to doctrines, and modes of worſhip, laws made for the ſupport of public inſtruction, and the religious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:032377_0027_0FF2036FB68B7C58"/>of the ſabbath, cannot in any proper ſenſe infringe on liberty of conſcience.</p>
            <p>IF religion then has a juſt claim to the protection of government, it muſt be peculiarly important to official characters. The more exalted gentlemen are in office, the more public and extenſive their ſphere of action, the more neceſſary is it, that their whole conduct ſhould exhibit undeniable evidence of their attachment to religion. The great body of the people look up to them, not only for examples in every virtue, but for that legiſlative encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the cauſe of religion, on which its general proſperity under God muſt in a great meaſure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend. If godlineſs be profitable unto all things, if its political advantages be as great as has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, good policy will certainly lead to a preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ervation of the laws for the ſupport of morality, to a maintenance and if need be, to an enlargement of the ſtatutes for the ſuppreſſion of vice, and to the appointment of ſuch men to fill the ſeveral offices under our government, as are known to be at leaſt men of unblemiſhed morals. A ſteady adherence to this rule would diſappoint the hopes of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and proportionably encourage thoſe of the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous. It would make our legiſlature a terror in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to evil doers, and a praiſe to them who do well. Much depends on the conduct of rulers. To ſupport religion, law and liberty, is theirs. We live in a day when each of theſe have many foes. When the advocates of infidelity are loudly boaſting of the increaſe of their numbers—When licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is alarmingly prevalent, and when the federal conſtitution, the great palladium of our liberties, has been violently attacked. That amidſt all theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal evils, and the dangers which ariſe from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign inſults and depredations, our rulers may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by unerring wiſdom—that they may ever poſſeſs that firmneſs and fidelity, which the arduous
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:032377_0028_0FF2037387A53AC8"/>duties of their ſtation, and the peculiar difficulties of the day require, is the ardent prayer of all their pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſtituents. And ſupported by ſo important an encouragement, it is hoped, and expected that they will diſregard the unfounded clamours, of the enemies of religion and our country.</p>
            <p>BUT beſides the ſupport which chriſtianity has a right to expect from government, it is of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt importance, that it receive all encouragement from ever y claſs of citizens. In this buſineſs all ſhould be united, and extend as far, and as general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as poſſible the practice of true piety. If there were no futurity, if the race of men had been made only for this world, ſtill the univerſal practice of godlineſs would be a moſt deſirable object, and as ſuch muſt meet the ſincere approbation of every friend to his country. And if ſo, how inconceivably important indeed is it, when we are aſſured by a well authenticated revelation from heaven, that we are all acting not for time only, or principally, but for the rewards, or the puniſhments of an eternity. The motives to the choice and practice of godlineſs are immenſely great. Both temporal and eternal ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efit, the promiſe of this life and of that which is to come, are all preſented to our view, and placed in a very conſpicuous light before our eyes, and nothing but the groſſeſt ſtupidity can prevent our feeling the force of them.</p>
            <p>THIS ſubject leads me further to remark, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the laws of our land have excuſed clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men from the burdens of civil functions, and left them at liberty to devote their whole time to the buſineſs of their peculiar profeſſion, yet no body of men are more deeply intereſted in the proſperity of their country, or under greater obligations to conſtant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions for that purpoſe. And happily their duty as chriſtian miniſters, and as members of civil ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:032377_0029_0FF203486CA8EC20"/>perfectly coincide. In the former, which is the principal capacity in which they are called to act, they are pointedly commanded by their divine Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to become <hi>enſamples to the whole flock over which the Holy Ghoſt has made them overſeers, and to teach, rebuke and exhort with all long ſuffering and doctrine.</hi> The firſt object of their labors is to prepare men for the kingdom of heaven. This they are to attempt by explaining to them the nature, and enforcing on them the importance of true godlineſs, and by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading them, if poſſible, to a faithful practice of it in all its branches. If they can effect this great purpoſe, they will not only benefit the ſouls of men, and advance the kingdom of the Redeemer in the world, but do a moſt important ſervice to civil ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. If they can become the happy inſtruments of leading thoſe among whom they labor, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake ſin, to embrace the goſpel, to love God and practiſe every branch of true piety; they will no doubt obey magiſtrates, and ſubmit themſelves to every ordinance of man, for the Lord's ſake. The more we promote the intereſt of religion, the more ſhall we advance that of civil ſociety. The more ſpiritual good we do the ſouls of men, the more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual aid ſhall we afford to the rulers of our land. Miniſters have every argument ſet before them, to excite them to diligence and fidelity, drawn from the temporal, and the eternal intereſt of men. And in addition to all this, they are further animated, by a conſideration of that future account which they muſt give of themſelves, before an aſſembled univerſe. Though the ſtupidity of this infidel age, may often excite in them the complaint of the evangelical prophet "that they labor in vain and ſpend their ſtrength for nought," yet let them not be weary in well doing, but perſevere with redoubled diligence, ſupported by the glorious hope that their labor will not be in vain in the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:032377_0030_0FF2034A41B992F8"/>LASTLY, the foregoing obſervations point out to us all, the ſure means of promoting national happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Public virtue, and political proſperity are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately connected. Righteouſneſs will exalt, and vice bring ruin on a people. If then we are true patriots, if it is our glory <hi>really to be,</hi> as well as to be <hi>eſteemed</hi> the friends of our country, we ſhall devote ourſelves to the ſincere practice of true godlineſs; and in our ſeveral ſtations faithfully endeavour its univerſal promotion. Enmity to religion is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with true patriotiſm. They who are either publicly or privately undermining the foundation of piety toward God, are weakening the force of moral obligation, and aiming a fatal blow againſt the dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt privileges reſulting from the ſocial compact. If we would wiſh to be a happy people, to enjoy in peace and tranquillity the bleſſings of a moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent conſtitution, and to tranſmit thoſe fruits of ſuch vaſt expenſe of blood and treaſure unimpaired to poſterity, it is of the higheſt importance, that we practiſe true godlineſs; as every other expedient, while that is neglected, will be found utterly inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>
            <p>IN one word, the choice and practice of religion is urged on us, by every conſideration which ought to affect a rational mind. Our duty to God, our country, and ourſelves require it—our intereſt and happineſs for time and eternity demand it of us. May God, of his infinite mercy grant us all, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience it, in all its power, and in all its comforts and conſolations, for the ſake of the dear Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
