            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>'TIS not the only, nor even the chief, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of theſe ſheets, to refute the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and objections of Mr Hume, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to miracles: the chief deſign of them is, to ſet the principal argument for chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity in its proper light. On a ſubject that hath been ſo often treated, 'tis impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to avoid ſaying many things which have been ſaid before. It may, however, with reaſon be affirmed, that there ſtill remains, on this ſubject, great ſcope for new obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Beſides, it ought to be remembered, that the evidence of any complex argument depends very much on the order into which the material circumſtances are digeſted, and the manner in which they are diſplayed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Eſſay on Miracles</hi> deſerves to be conſidered, as one of the moſt dangerous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks that have been made on our religion. The danger reſults not ſolely from the merit of <hi>THE PIECE;</hi> it reſults much more from that of <hi>THE AUTHOR. The piece</hi> itſelf, like every other work of Mr Hume, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious;
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:022387_0004_0FB861A5EA882348"/>genious; but its merit is more of the orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial kind than of the philoſophical. The merit of <hi>the author,</hi> I acknowledge is great. The many uſeful volumes he hath publiſhed of <hi>hiſtory,</hi> as well as on <hi>criticiſm, politics,</hi> and <hi>trade,</hi> have juſtly procured him, with all perſons of taſte and diſcernment, the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reputation as a writer. What pity is it, that this reputation ſhould have been ſullied by attempts to undermine the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions both of <hi>natural religion</hi> and of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For my own part, I think it a piece of juſtice in me, to acknowledge the obligations I owe the author, before I enter on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed examination. I have not only been much entertained and inſtructed by his works; but, if I am poſſeſſed of any talent in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract reaſoning, I am not a little indebted to what he hath written on <hi>human nature,</hi> for the improvement of that talent. If therefore, in this tract, I have refuted Mr Hume's <hi>Eſſay,</hi> the greater ſhare of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is perhaps to be aſcribed to Mr Hume himſelf. The compliment which the Ruſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an monarch, after the famous battle of Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towa, paid the Swediſh generals, when he
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:022387_0005_0FB861A90701C708"/>gave them the honourable appellation of his <hi>maſters in the art of war,</hi> I may, with great ſincerity, pay my acute and ingenious adverſary.</p>
            <p>I ſhall add a few things concerning the occaſion and form of the following diſſertati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Some of the principal topics here diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, were more briefly treated in a <hi>ſermon</hi> preached before the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>ABERDEEN,</hi> and are now made public at their deſire. To the end that an argument of ſo great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance might be more fully and freely canvaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than it could have been, with propriety, in a ſermon, it was judged neceſſary to new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>model the diſcourſe, and to give it that form in which it now appears.</p>
            <p>The <hi>edition</hi> of Mr Hume's eſſays to which I always refer in this work, is that printed at <hi>LONDON,</hi> in duodecimo, <hi>1750,</hi> intitled, <hi>Philoſophical eſſays concerning human underſtanding.</hi> I have, ſince finiſhing this tract, ſeen a later <hi>edition,</hi> in which there are a few <hi>variations.</hi> None of them appeared to me ſo material, as to give ground for altering the <hi>quotations</hi> and <hi>references</hi> here uſed. There is indeed one <hi>alteration,</hi>
               <pb n="viii" facs="unknown:022387_0006_0FB861AA5AC977B8"/>which candour required that I ſhould men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I have accordingly mentioned it in a note
<note n="*" place="bottom">page 126,</note>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>arguments</hi> of the eſſayiſt I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to refute by <hi>argument.</hi> Mere <hi>declamation</hi> I know no way of refuting, but by <hi>analyſing</hi> it; nor do I conceive how inconſiſtencies can be anſwered otherwiſe than by <hi>expoſing</hi> them. In ſuch <hi>analyſis</hi> and <hi>expoſition,</hi> which, I own, I have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted without ceremony or reſerve, an air of <hi>ridicule</hi> is unavoidable: but this <hi>ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule,</hi> I am well aware, if founded in <hi>miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation,</hi> will at laſt rebound upon <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> It is poſſible, that, in ſome things I have <hi>miſtaken</hi> the author's meaning; I am conſcious, that I have not, in any thing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly <hi>miſrepreſented</hi> it.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>"CHRISTIANITY," it hath been ſaid, "is not founded in argument." If it were only meant by theſe words, that the religion of Jeſus could not, by the ſingle aid of reaſoning, produce its full effect upon the heart; every true Chriſtian would chearfully ſubſcribe to them. No arguments unaccompanied by the influences of the Holy Spirit; can convert the ſoul from ſin to God; though even to ſuch converſion, arguments are, by the agency of the Spirit, render'd ſubſervient. Again, if we were to underſtand by this aphoriſm, that the principles of our religion could never have been diſcovered, by the natural and unaſſiſted faculties of man; this poſition, I preſume, would be as little diſputed as the former. But if, on the contrary, under the cover of an ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous expreſſion, it is intended to inſinuate, that thoſe principles, from their very nature, can admit no rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal evidence of their truth, (and this, by the way, is the only meaning which can avail our antagoniſts) the goſpel, as well as common ſenſe, loudly reclaims againſt it.</p>
            <p>The Lord JESUS CHRIST, the author of our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, often argued, both with his diſciples and with his adverſaries, as with reaſonable men, on the principles of reaſon, without this faculty, he well know, they could not be ſuſceptible either of religion or of law. He argued from prophecy, and the conformity of the event to the prediction
<note n="*" place="bottom">Luke xxiv. 25. &amp;c. John v. 39, &amp; 46.</note>. He
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:022387_0011_0FB861B59F83FE40"/>argued from the teſtimony of John the Baptiſt, who was generally acknowledged to be a prophet
<note n="†" place="bottom">John v. 32, &amp; 33.</note>. He argued from the miracles which he himſelf perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<note n="‡" place="bottom">John v. 36. x. 25, 37, 38. xiv. 10, 11.</note>, as uncontrovertible evidences, that GOD Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty operated by him, and had ſent him. He expoſtulates with his enemies, that they did not uſe their reaſon on this ſubject. <hi>Why,</hi> ſays he, <hi>even of yourſelves, judge ye not what is right</hi>

            <p>THUS much I thought proper to premiſe, not to ſerve as an apology for the deſign of this tract, (the

Whilſt therefore we enforce an argument, which, in ſupport of our religion, was ſo frequently inſiſted on by its divine founder, we will not dread the reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful titles of <hi>dangerous friends,</hi> or <hi>diſguiſed eneries</hi> of revelation.

<note n="‡" place="bottom">p. 204.</note>; not, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, through malice againſt them, but as a ſort of excuſe for himſelf, or at leaſt a handle for introducing a very ſtrange and unmeaning compliment to the religion of his country, after a very bold attempt to undermine it. We will however do him the juſtice to own, that he hath put it out of our power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort the charge.

               <p>IT is not the aim of this author to evince, that miracles, if admitted to be true, would not be a ſufficient evidence of a divine miſſion. His deſign is ſolely to prove, that miracles which have not been the objects of our own ſenſes, at leaſt ſuch as are ſaid to have been performed in atteſtation of any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ſyſtem, cannot reaſonably be admitted by us, or believ'd on the teſtimony of others.

He ſeems however immediately ſenſible, that in aſſerting this, he hath gone too far; and therefore, in the end of the ſame paragraph, retracts part of what he had advanced in the beginning. <q>We may eſtabliſh it as a maxim that no human teſtimony can have ſuch force, as to prove a miracle, and make it a juſt foundation for any ſyſtem of religion.</q> In the note on this paſſage, he has theſe words. <q>I beg the limitation here made, may be remarked, when I ſay, that a miracle can never be prov'd, ſo as to be the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a ſyſtem of religion. For I own that otherwiſe there may poſſibly be miracles, or violations of the uſual courſe of nature, of ſuch a kind, of to admit of proof from human teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</q>
               </p>
               <p>So much for that cardinal point, which the eſſayiſt labours ſo ſtrenuouſly to evince; and which, if true, will not only be ſubverſive of revelation, as received by us, on the teſtimony of the apoſtles, and prophets, and martyrs; but will directly lead to this general concluſion: <q>That it is impoſſible for God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to give a revelation, attended with ſuch evidence that it can be reaſonably believed in after-ages, or even in the ſame age, by any perſon who hath
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:022387_0016_0FB861C0C9CE2D78"/>not been an eye-witneſs of the miracles, by which it is ſupported.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now, by what wonderful proceſs of reaſoning is this ſtrange concluſion made out? Several topics have been employ'd for the purpoſe by this ſubtle diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. Among theſe there is one principal argument which he is at great pains to ſet off to the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Here indeed he claims a particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, having diſcovered it himſelf. His title to the honour of the diſcovery, 'tis not my buſineſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovert; I confine myſelf entirely to the conſideration of its importance. To this end I ſhall now lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reader, the unanſwerable argument, as he flatters himſelf it will be found; taking the freedom for brevity's ſake, to compendize the reaſoning, and to omit whatever is ſaid merely for illuſtration. To do otherwiſe would lay me under the neceſſity of tranſcribing the greater part of the eſſay.</p>
               <p>'Experience,' ſays he, <q>is our only guide in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning concerning matters of fact
<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 174.</note>. Experience is in ſome things variable, in ſome things uniform. A variable experience gives riſe only to probability; an uniform experience amounts to a proof

                     </gap> he exact force of the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior evidence
<note n="‡" place="bottom">ibid.</note>. Our belief or aſſurance of any fact
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:022387_0017_0FB861C5AB9EDEC0"/>from the report of eye-witneſſes, is derived from no other principle than experience; that is, our obſervation of the veracity of human teſtimony, and of the uſual conformity of facts to the reports of witneſſes
<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 176.</note>. Now, if the fact atteſted partakes of the marvellous, if it is ſuch as has ſeldom fallen under our obſervation, here is a conteſt of two op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite experiences, of which the one deſtroys the other, as far as its force goes, and the ſuperior can only operate on the mind by the force which remains. The very ſame principle of experience, which gives us a certain degree of aſſurance in the teſtimony of witneſſes, gives us alſo, in this caſe, another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of aſſurance, againſt the fact which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to eſtabliſh; from which contradiction, there neceſſarily ariſes a counterpoiſe, and mutual deſtruction of belief and authority
<note n="†" place="bottom">p. 179.</note>. Further, if the fact affirmed by the witneſſes, inſtead of being only marvellous, is really miraculous; if beſides the teſtimony conſider'd apart and in itſelf, amounts to an entire proof; in that caſe there is proof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt proof, of which the ſtrongeſt muſt prevail, but ſtill with a diminution of its force, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that of its antagoniſt. A miracle is a viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the laws of nature; and as a firm and unalterable experience has eſtabliſhed theſe laws, the proof againſt a miracle from the very nature of the fact, is as entire, as any argument from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience can poſſibly be imagined
<note n="‡" place="bottom">p. 180.</note>. And if ſo, 'tis an undeniable conſequence, that it cannot be ſurmounted by any proof whatever from teſtimony. A miracle, therefore, however atteſted, can never
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:022387_0018_0FB861C6D3C79940"/>be render'd credible, even in the loweſt degree.</q> This, in my apprehenſion, is the ſum of the argument on which my ingenious opponent reſts the ſtrength of his cauſe.</p>
               <p>IN anſwer to this I propoſe firſt to prove, that the whole is built upon a falſe hypotheſis. That the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of teſtimony is derived ſolely from experience, which ſeems to be an axiom of this writer, is at leaſt not ſo inconteſtable a truth as he ſuppoſes it; that, on the contrary, teſtimony hath a natural and original influence on belief, antecedent to experience, will, I imagine, eaſily be evinced. For this purpoſe let it be remark'd, that the earlieſt aſſent, whch is given to teſtimony by children, and which is previous to all experience, is in fact the moſt unlimited, that by a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual experience of manknd, it is gradually contracted, and reduced to narrower bounds. To ſay, therefore, that our diffidence in teſtimony is the reſult of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is more philoſophical, becauſe more conſonant to truth, than to ſay that our faith in teſtimony has this foundation. Accordingly youth, which is unexperienced, is credulous; age, on the contrary, is diſtruſtful. Exactly the reverſe would be the caſe were this author's doctrine juſt.</p>
               <p>Perhaps it will be ſaid. If experience is allowed to be the only meaſure of a logical or reaſonable faith in teſtimony, the queſtion, <hi>Whether the influence of teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony on belief, be original or deriv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d?</hi> if 'tis not mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly verbal, is at leaſt of no importance in the preſent controverſy. But I maintain it is of the greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. The difference between us is by no means ſo inconſiderable, as to a careleſs view it may
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:022387_0019_0FB861C847024FC0"/>appear. According to his philoſophy, the preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is againſt the teſtimony or (which amounts to the ſame thing) there is not the ſmalleſt preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in its favour, till properly ſupported by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. According to the explication given, there is the ſtrongeſt preſumption in favour of the teſtimony, till properly refuted by experience.</p>
               <p>If it be objected by the author, that ſuch a faith in teſtimony as is prior to experience, muſt be unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and unphiloſophical, becauſe unaccountable; I ſhould reply, that there are, and muſt be, in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, ſome original grounds of belief, beyond which our reſearches cannot proceed, and of which therefore 'tis vain to attempt a rational account. I ſhould deſire the objector to give a reaſonable account of his faith in this principle, that <hi>ſimilar cauſes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways produce ſimilar effects;</hi> or in this, that <hi>the courſe of nature will be the ſame to-morrow, that it was ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday, and is to day:</hi> principles, which he himſelf acknowledges, are neither intuitively evident, nor deduced from premiſes; and which nevertheleſs we are under a neceſſity of preſuppoſing, in all our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings from experience
<note n="*" place="bottom">Sceptical doubts. Part 2.</note>. I ſhould deſire him to give a reaſonable account of his faith in the cleareſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations of his memory, which he will find it alike impoſſible either to doubt, or to explain. Indeed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory bears nearly the ſame relation to experience, that teſtimony does. Certain it is that the defects and miſrepreſentations of memory are often corrected by experience. Yet ſhould any perſon hence infer, that memory derives all its evidence from experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he would fall into a manifeſt abſurdity. For,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:022387_0020_0FB861CE08F4EC48"/>on the contrary, experience derives its origin ſolely from memory, and is nothing elſe but the general maxims or concluſions, we have form'd, from the compariſon of particular facts remember'd. If we had not previouſly given an implicit faith to memory, we had never been able to acquire experience. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſay that memory, which gives birth to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, may nevertheleſs in ſome inſtances be correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by experience, no more is imply'd, but that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences form'd from the moſt lively and perſpicuous reports of memory, ſometimes ſerve to rectify the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes which ariſe from ſuch reports of this faculty, as are moſt languid and confus'd. Thus memory, in theſe inſtances, may be ſaid to correct itſelf. The caſe is often much the ſame with experience and teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as will appear more clearly in the ſecond ſection, where I ſhall conſider the ambiguity of the word <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,</hi> as us'd by this author.</p>
               <p>BUT how, ſays Mr Hume, is teſtimony then to be refuted? Principally in one or other of theſe two ways: <hi>firſt,</hi> and moſt directly, by contradictory te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony; that is, when an equal or greater number of witneſſes, equally or more credible, atteſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: <hi>ſecondly,</hi> by ſuch evidence either of the inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity or baſeneſs of the witneſſes, as is ſufficient to diſcredit them. What, rejoins my antagoniſt, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not then teſtimony be confuted by the extraordinary nature of the fact atteſted? Has this conſideration no weight at all? That this conſideration hath no weight at all, 'twas never my intention to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; that by itſelf it can very rarely, if ever, amount to a refutation againſt ample and unexceptiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:022387_0021_0FB861CFC7A75DA8"/>teſtimony, I hope to make extremely plain. Who hath ever denied, that the uncommonneſs of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent related, is a preſumption againſt its reality; and that chiefly on account of the tendency, which, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience teacheth us, and this author hath obſerved, ſome people have to ſacrifice truth to the love of wonder
<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 184.</note>? The queſtion only is, How far does this preſumption extend? In the extent which Mr Hume hath aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd it, he hath greatly exceeded the limits of nature, and conſequently of all juſt reaſoning.</p>
               <p>In his opinion, <q>When the fact atteſted is ſuch as has ſeldom fallen under our obſervation, there is a conteſt of two oppoſite experiences, of which the one deſtroys the other, as far as its force goes, and the ſuperior can only operate on the mind, by the force which remains
<note n="†" place="bottom">p. 179.</note>.</q> There is a metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical, I had almoſt ſaid, a magical <hi>balance</hi> and <hi>arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metic,</hi> for the weighing and ſubtracting of evidence, to which he frequently recurs, and with which he ſeems to fancy he can perform wonders. I wiſh he had been a little more explicit in teaching us how theſe rare inventions muſt be us'd. When a writer of genius and elocution expreſſes himſelf in general terms, he will find it an eaſy matter, to give a plauſible appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to things the moſt unintelligible in nature. Such ſometimes is this author's way of writing. In the inſtance before us he is particularly happy in his choice of metaphors. They are ſuch as are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally adapted to prepoſſeſs a reader in his favour. What candid perſon can think of ſuſpecting the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality of an inquirer, who is for <hi>weighing</hi> in the <hi>ſcales</hi> of reaſon, all the arguments on either ſide?
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:022387_0022_0FB861D14A0615F8"/>Who can ſuſpect his exactneſs who determines every thing by a <hi>numerical computation?</hi> Hence it is, that to a ſuperficial view his reaſoning appears ſcarce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to demonſtration; but, when narrowly canvaſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 'tis impracticable to find an application, of which, in a conſiſtency with good ſenſe, it is capable.</p>
               <p>In confirmation of the remark juſt now made, let us try how his manner of arguing on this point can be applied to a particular inſtance. For this purpoſe I make the following ſuppſition. I have lived for ſome years near a ferry. It conſiſts with my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the paſſage-boat has a thouſand times croſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the river, and as many times returned ſafe. An unknown man, whom I have juſt now met, tells me in a ſerious manner, that it is loſt; and affirms, that he himſelf ſtanding on the bank, was a ſpectator of the ſcene; that he ſaw the paſſengers carried down the ſtream, and the boat overwhelmed. No perſon, who is influenced in his judgment of things, not by philoſophical ſubtilties, but by common ſenſe, a much ſurer guide, will heſitate to declare, that in ſuch a teſtimony I have probable evidence of the fact aſſerted. But if leaving common ſenſe, I ſhall recur to metaphyſics, and ſubmit to be tutored in my way of judging by the eſſayiſt, he will remind me, <q>that there is here a conteſt of two oppoſite experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, of which the one deſtroys the other, as far as its force goes, and the ſuperior can only operate on the mind by the force which remains.</q> I am warned, that <q>the very ſame principle of experience, which gives me a certain degree of aſſurance in the teſtimony of the witneſs gives me alſo, in this caſe, another degree of aſſurance, againſt
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:022387_0023_0FB861D322B7F080"/>the fact, which he endeavours to eſtabliſh, from which contradiction there ariſes a counterpoiſe and mutual deſtruction of belief and authority
<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 179.</note>.</q>— Well, I would know the truth, if poſſible; and that I may conclude fairly and philoſophically, how muſt I balance theſe oppoſite experiences, as you are pleaſed to term them? Muſt I ſet the thouſand, or rather the two thouſand inſtances of the one ſide, againſt the ſingle inſtance of the other? In that caſe, 'tis eaſy to ſee, I have nineteen hundred and ninety-nine degrees of evidence that my information is falſe. Or, is it neceſſary, in order to make it credible, that the ſingle inſtance have two thouſand times as much evidence, as any of the oppoſite inſtances, ſuppoſing them equal among themſelves; or ſuppoſing them unequal, as much as all the two thouſand put together, that there may be at leaſt an equilibrium? This is impoſſible. I had for ſome of thoſe inſtances, the evidence of ſenſe, which hardly any teſtimony can equal, much leſs exceed. Once more, muſt the evidence I have of the veracity of the witneſs, be a full equivalent to the two thouſand inſtances, which oppoſe the fact atteſted? By the ſuppoſition, I have no poſitive evidence for or againſt his veracity, he being a perſon whom I never ſaw before. Yet if none of theſe be the balancing, which the eſſay-writer means, I deſpair of being able to diſcover his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Is then ſo weak a proof from teſtimony incapable of being refuted? I am far from thinking ſo; tho' even ſo weak a proof could not be overturned by ſuch a contrary experience. How then may it be
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:022387_0024_0FB861D69F391A60"/>overturned? <hi>Firſt,</hi> by contradictory teſtimony. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing homewards I meet another perſon, whom I know as little as I did the former; finding that he comes from the ferry, I aſk him cencerning the truth of the report. He affirms that the whole is a fiction; that he ſaw the boat, and all in it, come ſafe to land. This would do more to turn the ſcale, than fifty thouſand ſuch contrary inſtances, as were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. Yet this would not remove ſuſpicion. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if we were to conſider the matter abſtractly, one would think, that all ſuſpicion would be removed, that the two oppoſite teſtimonies would deſtroy each other, and leave the mind entirely under the influence of its former experience, in the ſame ſtate as if nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther teſtimony had been given. But this is by no means conſonant to fact. When once teſtimonies are introduced, former experience is generally of no account in the reckoning; it is but like the duſt of the balance, which hath not any ſenſible effect upon the ſcales. The mind hangs in ſuſpence between the two contrary declarations, and conſiders it as one to one, or equal improbability, that the report is true, or that it is falſe. Afterwards a third, and a fourth, and a fifth, confirm the declaration of the ſecond. I am then quite at eaſe. Is this the only effectual way of confuting falſe teſtimony? No. I ſuppoſe <hi>again,</hi> that inſtead of meeting with any perſon who can inform me concerning the fact, I get from ſome, who are acquainted with the witneſs information concerning his character. They tell me, he is notorious for lying; and that his lies are commonly forged, not with a view to intereſt, but merely to gratify a malicious pleaſure, which the takes in alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:022387_0025_0FB861D8E600CE38"/>ſtrangers. This, tho' not ſo direct a refutation as the former, will be ſufficient to diſcredit his report. In the former, where there is teſtimony contradicting teſtimony, the author's metaphor of a balance may be uſed with propriety. The things weighed are homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneal: and when contradictory evidences are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the mind, tending to prove poſitions which cannot be both true, the mind muſt decide on the comparative ſtrength of the oppoſite evidences, before it yield to either.</p>
               <p>But is this the caſe in the ſuppoſition firſt made? By no means. The two thouſand inſtances formerly known, and the ſingle inſtance atteſted, as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to different facts, tho' of a contrary nature, are not contradictory. There is no inconſiſtency in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving both. There is no inconſiſtency in receiving the laſt on weaker evidence, (if it be ſufficient evidence) not only than all the former together, but even than any of them ſingly. Will it be ſaid, that tho' the former inſtances are not themſelves contradictory to to the fact recently atteſted, they lead to a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that is contradictory? I anſwer, 'Tis true, that the experienced frequency of the conjunction of any two events, leads the mind to infer a ſimilar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction in time to come. But let it at the ſame time be remarked, that no man conſiders this inference, as having equal evidence with any one of thoſe paſt events, on which it is founded, and for the belief of which we have had ſufficient teſtimony. Before then the method recommended by this author can turn to any account, it will be neceſſary for him to compute and determine with preciſion, how many hundreds,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:022387_0026_0FB861DA8828AB38"/>how many thouſands, I might ſay how many myri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ads of inſtances, will confer ſuch evidence on the concluſion founded on them, as will prove an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poize for the teſtimony of one ocular witneſs, a man of probity, in a caſe of which he is allowed to be a competent judge.</p>
               <p>There is in <hi>arithmetic</hi> a rule called REDUCTION, by which numbers of different denominations are brought to the ſame denomination. If this ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous author ſhall invent a rule in <hi>logic,</hi> analogous to this, for reducing different claſſes of evidence to the ſame claſs, he will bleſs the world with a moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant diſcovery. Then indeed he will have the honour to eſtabliſh an everlaſting peace in the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blic of letters; then we ſhall have the happineſs to ſee controverſy of every kind, theological, hiſtorical, philoſophical, receive its mortal wound: for though, in every queſtion, we could not even then determine with certainty, on which ſide the truth lay, we could always determine (and that is the utmoſt the nature of the thing admits) with as much accuracy as geometry and algebra can afford, on which ſide the probability lay, and in what degree. But till this metaphyſical <hi>reduction</hi> is diſcovered, 'twill beimpoſſible where the evidences are of different orders, to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by <hi>ſubtraction</hi> the ſuperior evidence. We could not but eſteem him a novice in arithmetic, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſked, whether ſeven pounds or eleven pence make the greater ſum, and what is the difference? ſhould, by attending ſolely to the numbers, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking the value, conclude that eleven pence were the greater, and that it exceeded the other by four.
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:022387_0027_0FB861DBFA1A86E8"/>Muſt we not be equal novices in reaſoning, if we follow the ſame abſurd method? Muſt we not fall into as great blunders? Of as little ſignificancy do we find the balance. Is the value of things hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneal to be determined merely by weight? Shall ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be weighed againſt lead, or copper agaiſt iron? If in exchange for a piece of gold, I were offered ſome counters of baſer metal, is it not obvious, that till I know the comparative value of the metals, in vain ſhall I attempt to find what is equivalent, by the aſſiſtance either of ſcales or arithmetic?</p>
               <p>'TIS an excellent obſervation, and much to the purpoſe, which the late learned and pious biſhop of Durham, in his admirable performance on the analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of religion to the courſe of nature, hath made on this ſubject. "There is a very ſtrong preſumption," ſays he, <q>againſt the moſt ordinary facts, before the proof of them, which yet is overcome by almoſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny proof. There is a preſumption of millions to one againſt the ſtory of Caeſar, or of any other man. For ſuppoſe a number of common facts, ſo and ſo circumſtanced, of which one had no kind of proof, ſhould happen to come into one's thoughts every one would, without any poſſible doubt, conclude them to be falſe. The like may be ſaid of a ſingle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fact
<note n="*" place="bottom">Part 2. chap. 2. § 3.</note>.</q> What then, I may ſubjoin, ſhall be ſaid of an uncommon fact? And that an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fact may be proved by teſtimony, hath not <hi>yet</hi> been made a queſtion. But in order to illuſtrate the obſervation above cited, ſuppoſe, firſt, one at random mentions, that at ſuch an hour, of ſuch a day, in ſuch a
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:022387_0028_0FB861E13502E470"/>part of the heavens, a comet <hi>will</hi> appear; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion from experience would not be as millions, but as infinite to one, that the propoſition is falſe. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of this, ſuppoſe you have the teſtimony of but one ocular witneſs, a man of integrity, and ſkilled in aſtronomy, that at ſuch an hour, of ſuch a day, in ſuch a part of the heavens, a comet <hi>did</hi> appear; you will not heſitate one moment to give him credit. Yet all the preſumption that was againſt the truth of the firſt ſuppoſition, tho' almoſt as ſtrong evidence as experience can afford, was alſo againſt the truth of the ſecond, before it was thus atteſted.</p>
               <p>It is neceſſary to urge further, in ſupport of this doctrine, that as the water in the canal cannot be made to riſe higher than the fountain whence it flows; ſo it is impoſſible, that the evidence of teſtimony, if it proceeded from experience, ſhould ever exceed that of experience, which is its ſource? Yet that it greatly exceeds this evidence, appears not only from what hath been obſerved already, but ſtill more, from what I ſhall have occaſion to obſerve in the ſequel. One may ſafely affirm, that no conceivable concluſion from experience, can poſſeſs ſtronger evidence, than that which aſcertains us of the regular ſucceſſion and duration of day and night. The reaſon is, the inſtances on which this experience is founded, are both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out number and without exception. Yet even this concluſion, the author admits, as we ſhall ſee in the third ſection, may, in a particular inſtance, not only be ſurmounted, but even annihilated by teſtimony.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, let it be obſerved, that the immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion from experience is always <hi>general,</hi> and runs thus: 'This is the ordinary courſe of nature.'
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:022387_0029_0FB861E292676918"/>
                  <q>Such an event may reaſonably be expected, where all the circumſtances are entirely ſimilar.</q> But when we deſcend to particulars, the concluſion becomes wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, being more indirect. For though all the <hi>known</hi> circumſtances be ſimilar, all the <hi>actual</hi> circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances may not be ſimilar: nor is it poſſible in any caſe to be aſſured (our knowledge of things being at beſt but ſuperficial,) that all the <hi>actual</hi> circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are <hi>known</hi> to us. On the contrary, the direct concluſion from teſtimony is always <hi>particular,</hi> and runs thus; <q>This is the fact in ſuch an individual inſtance.</q> The remark now made will ſerve both to throw light on ſome of the preceding obſervations and to indicate the proper ſphere of each ſpecies of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. <hi>Experience</hi> of the paſt is the only rule where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we can judge concerning the <hi>future:</hi> And as when the ſon is below the horizon, we muſt do the beſt we can by light of the moon, or even of the ſtars; ſo in all caſes where we have no teſtimony, we are under a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of recurring to experience, and of balancing or numbering contrary obſervations
<note n="*" place="bottom">Where-ever ſuch balancing or numbering can take place, the oppoſite evidences muſt be entirely ſimilar. It will rarely aſſiſt us in judging of facts ſupported by teſtimony; for even where contradictory teſtimonies come to be conſidered, you will hardly find that the characters of the witneſſes on the oppoſite ſides are ſo preciſely equal, as that an arithmetical operation will evolve the credibility. In matters of pure experience it hath often place. Hence the computations that have been made of the value of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuities, inſurances, and ſeveral other commercial articles. In calculations concerning chances, the degree of probability may be determined with mathematical exactneſs. I ſhall here take the liberty, tho' the matter be not eſſential to the deſign of this tract, to correct an overſight in the eſſayiſt, who always ſuppoſes, that where contrary evidences muſt be balanced, the probability lies in the remainder or ſurplus, when the leſs number is ſubtracted from the greater. The probability doth not conſiſt in the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus, but in the ratio, or geometrical proportion, which the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers on the oppoſite ſides bear to each other. I explain myſelf thus. In favour of one ſuppoſed event, there are 100 ſimilar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, againſt it 50. In another caſe under conſideration, the favourable inſtances are 60, and only 10 unfavourable. Though the difference, or arithmetical proportion, which is 50, be the ſame in both caſes, the probability is by no means equal, as the author's way of reaſoning implies. The probability of the firſt event is as 100 to 50, or 2 to 1. The probability of the ſecond is as 60 to 10, or 6 to 1. Conſequently on comparing the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent examples, tho' both be probable, the ſecond is thrice as probable as the firſt.</note>. But the evidence
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:022387_0030_0FB861E45672EED8"/>reſulting hence, even in the cleareſt caſes, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be ſo weak, compared with that which reſults from teſtimony, that the ſtrongeſt conviction built merely on the former, may be overturned by the ſlighteſt proof exhibited by the latter. Accordingly the future hath in all ages and nations, been deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated the province of conjecture and uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>FROM what hath been ſaid, the attentive reader will eaſily diſcover, that the author's argument againſt <hi>miracles,</hi> hath not the leaſt affinity to the argument uſed by Dr Tillotſon againſt <hi>tranſubſtantiation,</hi> with which Mr Hume hath introduced his ſubject. Let us hear the argument, as it is related in the Eſſay, from the writings of the Archbiſhop. <q>'Tis acknowledged on all hands, ſays that learned prelate, that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority either of the ſcripture or of tradition, is founded merely on the teſtimony of the apoſtles, who were eye-witneſſes to thoſe miracles of our
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:022387_0031_0FB861E591F29EA8"/>Saviour, by which he proved his divine miſſion. Our evidence then for the truth of the Chriſtian religion, is leſs than the evidence for the truth of our ſenſes; becauſe even in the firſt authors of our religion, it was no greater; and 'tis evident, it muſt diminiſh in paſſing from them to their diſciples; nor can any one be ſo certain of the truth of their teſtimony, as of the immediate objects of his ſenſes. But a weaker evidence can never deſtroy a ſtronger; and therefore, were the doctrine of the real pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence ever ſo clearely revealed in ſcripture, 'twere directly contrary to the rules of juſt reaſoning to give our aſſent to it. It contradicts ſenſe, tho' both the ſcripture and tradition, on which it is ſuppoſed to be built, carry not ſuch evidence with them as ſenſe, when they are conſidered merely as external evidences, and are not brought home to every one's breaſt, by the immediate operation of the Holy Spirit.
<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 173, 174.</note>
                  </q> That the evidence of <hi>teſtimony</hi> is leſs than the evidence of <hi>ſenſe,</hi> is undeniable. <hi>Senſe</hi> is the ſource of that evidence, which is firſt transferred to the <hi>memory</hi> of the individual, as to a general reſervoir, and thence tranſmitted to others by the channel of <hi>teſtimony.</hi> That the original evidence can never gain any thing, but muſt loſe, by the tranſmiſſion, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond diſpute. What hath been rightly perceived, may be miſremembered; what is rightly remembered may, thro' incapacity, or thro' ill intention, be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reported; and what is rightly reported may be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtood. In any of theſe four ways therefore,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:022387_0032_0FB861E74F482BA0"/>either by defect of memory, of elocution, or of veracity in the relater, or by miſapprehenſion in the hearer, there is a chance, that the truth received by the information of the ſenſes, may be miſrepreſented or miſtaken; now every ſuch chance occaſions a real diminution of the evidence. That the ſacramental elements are bread and wine, not fleſh and blood, our ſight and touch, and taſte, and ſmell concur in teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If theſe ſenſes are not to be credited, the apoſtles themſelves could not have evidence of the miſſion of their maſter. For the greateſt external evidence they had, or could have, of his miſſion, was that which their ſenſes gave them, of the reality of his miracles. But whatever ſtrength there is in this argument with regard to the apoſtles, the argument with regard to us, who, for thoſe miracles, have only the evidence, not of our own ſenſes, but of their teſtimony, is incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably ſtronger. In their caſe, it is ſenſe contradicting ſenſe; in ours it is ſenſe contradicting teſtimony. But what relation has this to the author's argument? None at all. Teſtimony, it is acknowledged, is a weaker evidence than ſenſe. But it hath been already evinced, that its evidence for particular facts is infinitely ſtronger than that which the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral concluſion from experience can afford us.— Teſtimony holds directly of memory and ſenſe. Whatever is duly atteſted muſt be remembered by the witneſs; whatever is duly remembered muſt once have been perceived. But nothing ſimilar takes place with regard to experience, nor can teſtimony, with any appearance of meaning, be ſaid to hold of it.</p>

THUS I have ſhown, as I propoſed, that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's reaſoning proceeds on a falſe hypotheſis. — It ſuppoſeth teſtimony to derive its evidence ſolely from experience, which is falſe.—It ſuppoſeth by conſequence, that contrary obſervations have a weight in oppoſing teſtimony, which the firſt and moſt acknowledged principles of human reaſon, or, if you like the term better, common ſenſe, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſhows that they have not.—It aſſigns a rule for diſcovering the ſuperiority of contrary evidences, which, in the latitude there given it, tends to miſlead the judgment, and which 'tis impoſſible, by any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, to render of real uſe.</p>

               <head>SECTION II. <hi>Mr Hume charged with ſome fallacies in his way of managing the argument.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN the eſſay there is frequent mention of the word <hi>experience,</hi> and much uſe made of it. 'Tis ſtrange that the author hath not favoured us with the definition of a term of ſo much moment to his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This defect I ſhall endeavour to ſupply; and the rather, as the word appears to be equivocal, and to be uſed by the eſſayiſt in two very different ſenſes. The firſt and moſt proper ſignification of the word, which, for diſtinction's ſake, I ſhall call <hi>perſonal</hi> experience, is that given in the preced|'ing ſection. 'It is,' as was obſerved, <q>founded in <hi>memory,</hi> and conſiſts ſolely of the general maxims
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:022387_0034_0FB861EC5076EB88"/>or concluſions, that each individual hath formed, from the compariſon of the particular facts he hath remembered.</q> In the other ſignification, in which the word is ſometimes taken, and which I ſhall diſtinguiſh by the term <hi>derived,</hi> it may be thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined. <q>It is founded in <hi>teſtimony,</hi> and conſiſts not only of all the experiences of others, which have thro' that channel been communicated to us, but of all the general maxims or concluſions we have formed, from the compariſon of particular facts at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In propoſing his argument, the author would ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be underſtood to mean only <hi>perſonal</hi> experience; otherwiſe, his making teſtimony derive its light from an experience which derives its light from teſtimony, would be introducing what logicians term a <hi>circle in cauſes.</hi> It would exhibit the ſame things alternately, as cauſes and effects of each other. Yet nothing can be more limited, than the ſenſe which is conveyed under the term <hi>experience,</hi> in the firſt acceptation. The mereſt clown or peaſant derives incomparably more knowledge from teſtimony, and the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated experience of others, than in the longeſt life he could have amaſſed out of the treaſure of his own memory. Nay, to ſuch a ſcanty portion the ſavage himſelf is not confined. If that therefore muſt be the rule, the only rule, by which every teſtimony is ultimately to be judged, our belief in matters of fact muſt have very narrow bounds. No teſtimony ought to have any weight with us, that doth not relate an event, ſimilar at leaſt to ſome one obſervation, which
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:022387_0035_0FB861EE6FA697D8"/>we ourſelves have had acceſs to make. For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that there are ſuch people on the earth as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, could not, on that hypotheſis, be rendered cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible to one who had never ſeen a negro, not even by the moſt numerous and the moſt unexceptionable atteſtations. Againſt the admiſſion of ſuch teſtimony, however ſtrong, the whole force of the author's ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument evidently operates. But that innumerable abſurdities would flow from this principle, I might eaſily evince, did I not think the taſk ſuperfluous.</p>
               <p>The author himſelf is aware of the conſequences; and therefore, in whatever ſenſe he uſes the term <hi>experience</hi> in propoſing his argument; in proſecuting it, he with great dexterity ſhifts the ſenſe, and ere the reader is appriſed, inſinuates another. <q>'Tis a miracle,</q> ſays he, <q>that a dead man ſhould come to life, becauſe that has never been obſerved in any age or country. There muſt therefore be an uniform experience againſt every miraculous event, otherwiſe the event would not merit that appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 181.</note>.</q> Here the phraſe, <hi>an uniform experience againſt an event,</hi> in the latter clauſe, is implicitly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in the former, not what has never been obſerved BY US, but (mark his words) <hi>what has never been obſerved</hi> IN ANY AGE OR COUNTRY.— Now, what has been obſerved, and what has not been obſerved, in all ages and countries, pray how can you, Sir, or I, or any man, come to the knowledge of? Only I ſuppoſe by teſtimony, oral or written. The perſonal experience of every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual is limited to but a part of one age, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:022387_0036_0FB861EF7B241360"/>to a narrow ſpot of one country. If there be any other way of being made acquainted with facts, 'tis to me, I own, an impenetrable ſecret; I have no apprehenſion of it. If there be not any, what ſhall we make of that cardinal point, on which his argument turns? 'Tis in plain language, <q>Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is not intitled to the leaſt degree of faith, but as far as it is ſupported by ſuch an extenſive expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, as if we had not had a previous and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent faith in teſtimony, we could never have acquired.</q>
               </p>
               <p>How natural is the tranſition from one ſophiſm to another! You will ſoon be convinced of this, if you attend but a little to the ſtrain of the argument. "A miracle," ſays he, <q>is a violation of the laws of nature; and as a firm and unalterable expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hath eſtabliſhed theſe laws, the proof againſt a miracle is as entire, as any argument from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience can poſſibly be imagined
<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 180.</note>.</q> Again, <q>As an uniform experience amounts to a proof, there is here a direct and full proof, from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the fact, againſt the exiſtence of any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
<note n="†" place="bottom">p. 181.</note>.</q> I muſt once more aſk the author what is the preciſe meaning of the words <hi>firm, unalterable, uniform?</hi> An experience that admits no exception, is ſurely the only experience, which can with propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety be termed <hi>uniform, firm, unalterable.</hi> Now ſince, as was remarked above, the far greater part of this experience, which compriſeth every age and every country, muſt be derived to us from teſtimony; that the experience may be <hi>firm, uniform, unalterable</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:022387_0037_0FB861F10A272EA0"/>there muſt be no contrary teſtimony whatever. Yet by the author's own hypotheſis, the miracles he would thus confute, are ſupported by teſtimony At the ſame time to give ſtrength to his argument, he is under a neceſſity of ſuppoſing, that there is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception from the teſtimonies againſt them. Thus he falls into that paralogiſm, which is called <hi>begging the queſtion.</hi> What he gives with one hand, he takes with the other. He admits, in opening his deſign, what in his argument he implicitly denies.</p>
               <p>But that this, if poſſible, may be ſtill more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, let us attend a little to ſome expreſſions, which one would imagine he had inadvertently dropt. "So long," ſays he, <q>as the world endures, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, will the accounts of miracles and prodigies be found in all profane hiſtory
<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 174.</note>.</q> Why does he preſume ſo? A man ſo much attached to experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, can hardly be ſuſpected to have any other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon than, becauſe ſuch accounts have hitherto been found in all the hiſtories, profane as well as ſacred, of times paſt. But we need not recur to an inference to obtain this acknowledgment. It is often to be met with in the eſſay. In one place we learn, that the witneſſes for miracles are an infinite number
<note n="†" place="bottom">p: 190:</note>; in another, that all religious records of whatever kind abound with them
<note n="‡" place="bottom">p. 191:</note>. I leave it therefore to the author to explain, with what conſiſtency he can aſſert, that the laws of nature are eſtabliſhed by an uniform experience, (which experience is chiefly the reſult of teſtimony) and at the ſame time allow, that almoſt all human hiſtories are full of the relations of
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:022387_0038_0FB861F5D9898960"/>miracles and prodigies, which are violations of thoſe laws. Here is, by his own confeſſion, teſtimony againſt teſtimony, and very ample on both ſides. How then can one ſide claim a firm, uniform, and unalterable ſupport from teſtimony?</p>
               <p>It will be in vain to object, that the teſtimony in ſupport of the laws of nature, greatly exceeds the teſtimony for the violations of theſe laws; and that, if we are to be determined by the greater number of obſervations, we ſhall reject all miracles whatever. I aſk, Why are the teſtimonies much more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in the one caſe than in the other? The anſwer is obvious: Natural occurrences are much more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent than ſuch as are preternatural. But are all the accounts we have of the peſtilence to be rejected as incredible, becauſe, in this country, we hear not ſo often of that diſeaſe, as of the fever? Or, becauſe the number of natural births is infinitely greater than that of monſters, ſhall the evidence of the former be regarded as a confutation of all that can be advanced in proof of the latter? Such an objector needs to be reminded of what was proved in the foregoing ſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that the oppoſite teſtimonies relate to different facts, and are therefore not contradictory; that the concluſion founded on them, poſſeſſeth not the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the facts on which it is founded, but only ſuch a preſumptive evidence, as may be ſurmounted by the ſlighteſt poſitive proof. A general concluſion from experience is in compariſon but preſumptive and indirect; ſufficient teſtimony for a particular fact is direct and poſitive evidence.</p>

I SHALL remark one other fallacy in this author's reaſoning, before I conclude this ſection. <q>The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian prince,</q> ſays he, <q>who refuſed to believe the firſt relations concerning the effects of froſt, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned juſtly; and it naturally required very ſtrong teſtimony to engage his aſſent to facts, which aroſe from a ſtate of nature, with which he was unacquainted, and bore ſo little analogy to thoſe events, of which he had had conſtant and uniform experience. Tho' they were not contrary to his experience, they were not conformable to it
<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 179.</note>.</q> Here a diſtinction is artfully ſuggeſted, between what is <hi>contrary</hi> to experience, and what is <hi>not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable</hi> to it. The one he allows may be proved by teſtimony, but not the other. A diſtinction, for which the author ſeems to have ſo great uſe, it will not be improper to examine.</p>
               <p>If my reader happen to be but little acquainted with Mr Hume's writings, or even with the piece here examined, I muſt intreat him, ere he proceed any farther, to give the eſſay an attentive peruſal; and to take notice particularly, whether in one ſingle paſſage, he can find any other ſenſe given to the terms <hi>contrary to experience,</hi> but that which has <hi>not</hi> been <hi>experienced.</hi> Without this aid, I ſhould not be ſurpriſed, that I found it difficult to convince the judicious, that a man of ſo much acuteneſs, one ſo much a philoſopher as this author, ſhould, with ſuch formality, make a diſtinction, which not only the eſſay, but the whole tenour of his philoſophical writings, ſhows evidently to have no meaning. Is
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:022387_0040_0FB861FA8A797138"/>that which is contrary to experience a ſynonymous phraſe for that which implies a contradiction? If this were the caſe, there would be no need to recur to experience for a refutation; it would refute itſelf. But 'tis equitable that the author himſelf be heard, who ought to be the beſt interpreter of his own words. "When the fact atteſted," ſays he, <q>is ſuch a one, as has ſeldom fallen under our obſervation, here is a conteſt of two oppoſite experiences
<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 179.</note>.</q> In this paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, not the being <hi>never</hi> experienced, but even the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>ſeldom</hi> experienced conſtitutes an <hi>oppoſite</hi> experience. I can conceive no way but one, that the author can evade the force of this quotation; and that is, by obtruding on us, ſome new diſtinction between an <hi>oppoſite</hi> and a <hi>contrary</hi> experience. In order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude ſuch an attempt, I ſhall once more recur to his own authority. <q>'Tis no miracle that a man in ſeeming good health, ſhould die of a ſudden.</q> Why? <q>Becauſe ſuch a kind of death, tho' more unuſual than any other, hath yet been frequently obſerved to happen. But 'tis a miracle that a dead man ſhould come to life,</q> Why? Not becauſe of any inconſiſtency in the thing. That a body ſhould be this hour inanimate, and the next animated, is no more inconſiſtent, than the reverſe that it ſhould be this hour animated, and the next inanimate; though the one be common, and not the other. But the author himſelf anſwers the queſtion: <q>Becauſe that has never been obſerved in any age or country
<note n="†" place="bottom">p. 181.</note>.</q> All the contrariety then that there is in miracles to experience, doth, by his own conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:022387_0041_0FB861FC10B102A0"/>conſiſt ſolely in this, that they have never been obſerved; that is, they are not conformable to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, To his experience perſonal or derived, he muſt certainly mean; to what he has had acceſs to learn of different ages and countries. To ſpeak beyond the knowledge he hath attained, would be ridiculous. It would be firſt ſuppoſing a miracle, and then inferring a contrary experience, inſtead of concluding from experience, that the fact is miraculous.</p>
               <p>Now, I inſiſt, that as far as regards the author's argument, a fact perfectly unuſual, or not conformable to our experience, ſuch a fact as, for aught we have had acceſs to learn, was never obſerved in any age or country, is as incapable of proof from teſtimony, as miracles are; that, if this writer would argue conſiſtently, he could never, on his own principles, reject the one and admit the other. Both ought to be rejected or neither. I would not, by this be thought to ſignify, that there is no difference between a miracle and an extraordinary event: I know that the former implies the interpoſal of an inviſible agent, which is not implied in the latter. All that I intend to a ſert is, that the anthor's argument equally affects them both. Why doth ſuch interpoſal appear to him incredible? Not from any incongruity he diſcerns in the thing itſelf. He doth not pretend it. But 'tis not conformable to his experience. "A miracle," "ſays he," is a tranſgreſſion of the law of nature
<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 182. in the note.</note>," But how are the laws of nature known to us? By experience. What is the criterion, whereby we muſt
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:022387_0042_0FB861FD8C543448"/>judge, whether the laws of nature are tranſgreſſed? Solely the conformity or diſconformity of events to our experience. This writer ſurely will not pretend, that we can have any knowledge <hi>a priori,</hi> either of the law, or of the violation.</p>
               <p>Let us then examine by his own principles, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the King of Siam, of whom the ſtory he alludes to, is related by Locke
<note n="†" place="bottom">Eſſay on human underſtanding, book 4. chap. 2. § 5.</note>, could have ſufficient evidence from teſtimony, of a fact ſo contrary to his experience as the freezing of water. He could juſt ſay as much of this event, as the author can ſay of a dead man's being reſtored to life. <q>Such a thing was never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, as far as I could learn, in any age or country.</q> If the things themſelves too are imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conſidered and independently of the notions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by us in theſe northern climates, we ſhould account the firſt at leaſt as extraordinary as the ſecond. That ſo pliant a body as water ſhould become hard like pavement, ſo as to bear up an elephant on its ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, is as unlikely in itſelf, as that a body inanimate to-day ſhould be animated to-morrow. Nay, to the Indian monarch, I muſt think, that the firſt would appear more a miracle, more contrary to experience than the ſecond. If he had been acquainted with <hi>ice</hi> or frozen water, and afterwards ſeen it become fluid; but had never ſeen nor learned, that after it was melted, it became hard again, the relation muſt have appeared marvellous, as the proceſs from fluidity to hardneſs never had been experienced, tho' the reverſe often had. But I believe nobody will que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:022387_0043_0FB8620377FCFA30"/>that on this ſuppoſition it would not have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared quite ſo ſtrange, as it did. Yet this ſuppoſition makes the inſtance more parallel to the reſtoring of the dead to life. The proceſs from animate to inanimate we are all acquainted with; and what is ſuch a reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but the reverſing of this proceſs? So little reaſon had the author to inſinuate, that the one was only <hi>not conformable,</hi> the other <hi>contrary</hi> to experience. If there be a difference in this reſpect, the firſt to one alike unacquainted with both, muſt appear the more contrary of the two.</p>
               <p>Does it alter the matter, that he calls the former <q>a fact which aroſe from a ſtate of nature, with which the Indian was unacquainted?</q> Was not ſuch a ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> quite unconformable, or (which in the author's language I have ſhown to be the ſame) contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his experience? Is then a ſtate of nature which is contrary to experience, more credible than a ſingle fact contrary to experience? I want the ſolution of one difficulty: The author, in order to ſatisfy me, preſents me with a thouſand others. Is this ſuitable to the method he propoſes in another place, of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting always the leſs miracle and rejecting the greater
<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 182.</note>? Is it not, on the contrary, admitting without any difficulty the greater miracle, and thereby removing the difficulty, which he otherwiſe would have had in admitting the leſs? Does he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, that to exhibit a ſtate of nature entirely differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from what we experience at preſent, is one of thoſe enormous prodigies, which, in his account, render the Pentateuch unworthy of credit
<note n="†" place="bottom">p. 206.</note>? "No
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:022387_0044_0FB86204F245B0A0"/>Indian," ſays he in the note, <q>'tis evident, could have experience that water did not freeze in cold climates. This is placing nature in a ſituation quite unknown to him, and 'tis impoſſible for him to tell <hi>a priori,</hi> what will reſult from it.</q> This is preciſely, as if, in reply to the author's objection from experience againſt the raiſing of a dead man (ſuppoſe Lazarus) to life, I ſhould retort: <q>Neither you, Sir, nor any who live in this century can have experience, that a dead man could not be reſtored to life at the command of one divinely commiſſioned to give a revelation to men. This is placing nature in a ſituation quite unknown to you, and 'tis impoſſible for you to tell <hi>a priori</hi> what will reſult from it. This therefore is not contrary to the courſe of nature, in caſes where all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances are the ſame. As you never ſaw one veſted with ſuch a commiſſion, you are as unexperienced, as ignorant of this point, as the inhabitants of Sumatra are of the froſts in Muſcovy; you cannot therefore reaſonably, any more than they, be poſitive as to the conſequences.</q> Should he rejoin, as doubtleſs he would, <q>This is not taking away the difficulty; but, like the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant and the tortoiſe, in the account given by ſome barbarians of the manner in which the earth is ſupported, it only ſhifts the difficulty a ſtep further back. My objection ſtill recurs. That any man ſhould be endowed with ſuch power is contrary to experience, and therefore incredible:</q> Should he, I ſay, rejoin in this manner, I could only add. <q>Pray Sir, reviſe your own words lately quoted, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:022387_0045_0FB86208137F0338"/>impartially whether they be not as glaringly expoſed to the like reply.</q> For my part, I can only perceive one difference that is material between the two caſes. You frankly confeſs, that with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the freezing of water, beſides the abſolute want of experience, there would be from analogy a preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt it, which ought to weigh with a rational Indian. I think, on the contrary, in the caſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by me of one commiſſioned by Heaven, there is at leaſt no preſumption againſt the exertion of ſuch a miraculous power. There is rather a preſumption in its favour.</p>
               <p>Does the author then ſay, that no teſtimony could give the King of Siam ſufficient evidence of the effects of cold on water? No. By implication he ſays the contrary: "It required very ſtrong teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony." Will he ſay, that thoſe moſt aſtoniſhing effects of electricity lately diſcovered, ſo entirely unanalogous to every thing before experienced, will he ſay, that ſuch facts no reaſonable man could have ſufficient evidence from teſtimony to believe? No. We may preſume, he will not, from his deciſion in the former caſe; and if he ſhould, the common ſenſe of mankind would reclaim againſt his extravagance. Yet 'tis obvious to every conſiderate reader, that his argument concludes equally againſt thoſe truly mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous, as againſt miraculous events; both being alike unconformable, or alike contrary to former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<note n="*" place="bottom">I cannot forbear to obſerve, that many of the principal terms employed in the eſſay, are uſed in a manner extremely vague and unphiloſophical. I have remarked the confuſion I find in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the words, <hi>experience, contrariety, conformity:</hi> I might remark the ſame thing of the word, <hi>miracle.</hi> "A miracle," 'tis ſaid, p. 182, in the note, <q>may be accurately defined, A TRANS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GRESSION <hi>of a law of nature, by a particular volition of the Deity, or by the interpoſal of ſome inviſible agent.</hi>
                     </q> The word <hi>tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> invariably denotes a criminal oppoſition to authority. The author's accuracy in repreſenting God as a tranſgreſſor, I have not the perſpicacity to diſcern. Does he intend, by throwing ſomething monſtrous into the definition, to infuſe into the reader a prejudice againſt the thing defined? But ſuppoſing that thro' inadvertency, he had uſed the term <hi>tranſgreſſion,</hi> inſtead of <hi>ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> which would have been both intelligible and proper; one would at leaſt expect, that the word <hi>miracle</hi> in the eſſay, always expreſt the ſenſe of the definition. But this it evidently does not. Thus in the inſtance of the miracle ſuppoſed (p. 203, in the note) he calls it, in the beginning of the paragraph, <q>A violation of the uſual courſe of nature;</q> but in the end, after telling us that ſuch a miracle, on the evidence ſuppoſed, <q>our preſent phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers ought to receive for certain,</q> he ſubjoins, (how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently, let the reader judge) <q>and ought to ſearch for the cauſes, whence it might be derived.</q> Thus it is inſinuated, that tho' a fact apparently miraculous, and perfectly extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, might be admitted by a philoſopher, ſtill the reality of the miracle muſt be denied. For if the interpoſal of the Deity be the proper ſolution of the phenomenon, why ſhould we recur to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural cauſes? Hence a careleſs reader is inſenſibly led to think, that there is ſome ſpecial incredibility in ſuch an interpoſal, diſtinct from its <hi>uncommonneſs.</hi> Yet the author's great argument is built on this ſingle circumſtance, and places ſuch an interpoſition juſt on the ſame footing with every event that is equally uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. At one time, he uſes the word <hi>miracle</hi> to denote a <hi>bare improbability,</hi> as will appear in the ſixth ſection: at another, <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd</hi> and <hi>miraculous</hi> are, with him, ſynonymous terms; ſo are alſo the <hi>miraculous nature</hi> of an event, and its <hi>abſolute impoſſibility.</hi> Is this the ſtyle and manner of a reaſoner?</note>.</p>

               <head>SECTION III. <hi>Mr Hume himſelf gives up his favourite argument.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>'MR Hume himſelf,' methinks I hear my reader repeating with aſtoniſhment, <q>gives up his favourite argument! To prove this point is indeed a very bold attempt.</q> Yet that this attempt is not altogether ſo arduous, as at firſt hearing, he will poſſibly imagine, I hope, if favoured a while with his attention, fully to convince him. If to acknowledge, after all, that there may be miracles, which admit of proof from human teſtimony; if to acknowledge, that ſuch miracles ought to be received, not as probable only, but as abſolutely certain; or, in other words, that the proof from human teſtimony may be ſuch as that all the contrary uniform experience, ſhould not only be overbalanced, but, to uſe the author's expreſſion, ſhould be annihilated; if ſuch acknowledgments as theſe, are ſubverſive of his own principles; if by making them, he abandons his darling argument; this ſtrange part the eſſayiſt evidently acts.</p>
               <p>"I own," theſe are his words, <q>there may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be miracles, or violations of the uſual courſe of nature, of ſuch a kind as to admit a proof from
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:022387_0048_0FB86210DC380B78"/>human teſtimony, tho' perhaps</q> (in this he is modeſt enough, he avers nothing; <hi>perhaps</hi>) <q>it will be impoſſible to find any ſuch in all the records of hiſtory.</q> To this declaration he ſubjoins the following ſuppſition: <q>Suppoſe all authors, in all languages, agree, that from the 1ſt of January 1700, there was a total darkneſs over the whole earth for eight days; ſuppoſe that the tradition of this extraordinary event, is ſtill ſtrong and lively among the people; that all travellers, who return from foreign countries, bring us accounts of the ſame tradition, without the leaſt variation or contradiction: 'tis evident, that our preſent philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, inſtead of doubting of that fact, ought to receive it for certain, and ought to ſearch for the cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, whence it might be derived
<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 203, in the note.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Could one imagine, that the perſon who had made the above acknowledgment, a perſon too who is juſtly allowed by all who are acquainted with his writings, to poſſeſs uncommon penetration and philoſophical abilities, that this were the ſame individual, who had ſo ſhort while before affirmed, that "a miracle," or a violation of the uſual courſe of nature, <q>ſupported by any human teſtimony, is more properly a ſubject of deriſion than of argument
<note n="†" place="bottom">p. 194.</note>;</q> who had inſiſted, that <q>it is not requiſite, in order to reject the fact, to be able accurately to diſprove the teſtimony, and to trace its falſehood; that ſuch an evidence carries falſehood on the very face of it
<note n="‡" place="bottom">ib.</note>;</q> that <q>we need but oppoſe even to
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:022387_0049_0FB862128DEB1470"/>acloud of witneſſes, the abſolute impoſſibility, or,</q> which is all one, <q>miraculous nature of the events, which they relate; that this in the eyes of all reaſonable people, will alone be regarded as a ſufficient refutation
<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 196, &amp;c.</note>;</q> and who finally to put an end to all altercation on the ſubject had pronounced this <hi>oracle.</hi> 
                  <q>NO TESTIMONY FOR ANY KIND OF MIRACLE CAN EVER POSSIBLY AMOUNT TO A PROBABI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LITY, MUCH LESS TO A PROOF
<note n="†" place="bottom">p. 202.</note>.</q> Was there ever a more glaring contradiction!</p>
               <p>YET for the event ſuppoſed by the eſſayiſt, the teſtimony, in his judgment, would amount to a <hi>probability;</hi> nay to more than a probability, to a <hi>proof;</hi> let not the reader be aſtoniſhed, or if he cannot fail to be aſtoniſhed, let him not be incredulous, when I add, to <hi>more than a proof,</hi> more than a full, entire and direct proof; for even this I hope to make evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the author's principles and reaſoning. "And even ſuppoſing," ſays he, that is, granting for argument's ſake, <q>that the teſtimony for a miracle amounted to a proof, 'twould be oppoſed by another proof, derived from the very nature of the fact, which it would endeavour to eſtabliſh
<note n="‡" place="bottom">ib.</note>.</q> Here is then, by his own reaſoning, proof againſt proof, from which there could reſult no belief or opinion, unleſs the one is conceived to be in ſome degree ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to the other.

<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 180.</note>
                  </q> Before the author could believe ſuch a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle as he ſuppoſes, he muſt at leaſt be ſatisfied that the proof of it from teſtimony is ſtronger than the proof againſt it from experience. That we may form an accurate judgment of the ſtrength he here aſcribes to teſtimony, let us conſider what, by his own account, is the ſtrength of the oppoſite proof from experience. <q>A miracle is a violation of the laws of nature; and as a firm and unalterable expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience has eſtabliſhed theſe laws, the proof againſt a miracle, from the very nature of the fact, is as <hi>entire,</hi> as any argument from experience can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be imagined
<note n="†" place="bottom">ibid.</note>.</q> Again, <q>As an uniform experience amounts to a proof, there is here a <hi>direct</hi> and <hi>full</hi> proof, from the nature of the fact, againſt the exiſtence of any miracle
<note n="‡" place="bottom">p. 181.</note>.</q> The proof then which the eſſayiſt admits from teſtimony, is, by his own eſtimate, not only ſuperior to a <hi>direct</hi> and <hi>full</hi> proof; but even ſuperior to as <hi>entire</hi> a proof, as any argument from experience can poſſibly be imagined. Whence, I pray, doth teſtimony acquire ſuch ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing evidence? 'Teſtimony,' ſays the author, <q>hath no evidence, but what it derives from experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Theſe differ from each other only as the ſpecies from the genus.</q> Put then for <hi>teſtimony,</hi> the word <hi>experience,</hi> which in this caſe is equivalent, and the concluſion will run thus: <hi>Here is a proof from experience, which is ſuperior to as entire a proof from experience as can poſſible be imagined.</hi> This
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:022387_0051_0FB862170A4FC158"/>deduction from the author's words, the reader will percieve, is ſtrictly logical. What the meaning of it is, I leave Mr Hume to explain.</p>
               <p>What hath been above deduced, how much ſoever it be accounted, is not all that is implied in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion made by the author. He further ſays, that the miraculous fact ſo atteſted, ought not only to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but to be received <hi>for certain.</hi> Is it not enough, Sir, that you have ſhown that your moſt full, moſt direct, moſt perfect argument may be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; will nothing ſatisfy you now but its deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? One would imagine, that you had conjured up this demon, by whoſe irreſiſtible arm you propoſed to give a mortal blow to religion, and render ſcepticiſm triumphant, (that you had conjured him up, I ſay) for no other purpoſe, but to ſhow with what facility you could lay him. To be ſerious, does not this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor remember, that he had oftener than once laid it down as a maxim, That when there is proof againſt proof, we muſt incline to the ſuperior, ſtill with a diminution of aſſurance, in proportion to the ſorce of its antagoniſt
<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 178. 180.</note>? But when a fact is received <hi>for certain,</hi> there can be no ſenſible diminution of aſſurance, ſuch diminution always implying ſome doubt and <hi>uncertainty.</hi> Conſequently the general proof from experience, tho' as entire as any argument from experience can poſſibly be imagined, is not only ſurmounted, but is really in compariſon as nothing, or, in Mr Hume's phraſe, undergoes annihilation, when balanced with the particular proof from teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. Great indeed, it muſt be acknowledged, is
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:022387_0052_0FB86218CD3ACF70"/>the force of truth. This concluſion, on the principles I have been endeavouring to eſtabliſh, has nothing in it, but what is conceivable and juſt; but on the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the eſſay, which deduce all the force of teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony from experience, ſerves only to confound the underſtanding, and to involve the ſubject in midnight darkneſs.</p>
               <p>'TIS therefore manifeſt, that either this author's principles condemn his own method of judging, with regard to miraculous facts; or that his method of judging ſubverts his principles, and is a tacit deſertion of them. Thus that impregnable fortreſs, the aſylum of infidelity, which he ſo lately gloried in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving erected, is in a moment abandoned by him, as a place untenable.</p>

<note n="†" place="bottom">ib.</note>
                  </q> Notwithſtanding this ſtrong affirmation, there is reaſon to ſuſpect that the author is not in his heart, ſo great an enemy to the love of wonder, as he affects to appear. No man can make a greater conceſſion in favour of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, than he hath done in the paſſage quoted in the preceding ſection. No man was ever fonder of para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, and, in theoretical ſubjects, of every notion that is remote from ſentiments univerſally received.

<note n="*" place="bottom">Dedication to the four diſſertations.</note>. There muſt ſurely be ſome foundation for ſo univerſal a cenſure. If therefore, in reſpect of the paſſion for the marvellous, he differ from other people, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference ariſeth from a particular delicacy in this gentleman, which makes him nauſeate even to wonder with the crowd. He is of that ſingular turn that where every body is ſtruck with aſtoniſhment, he can ſee nothing wondrous in the leaſt; at the ſame time he diſcovers prodigies, where no ſoul but himſelf ever dreamt that there were any.</p>
               <p>We may therefore reſt aſſured of it, that the author might be conciliated to the <hi>love of wonder,</hi> provided the <hi>ſpirit of religion</hi> be kept at a diſtance, againſt which he hath unluckily contracted a mortal antipathy, againſt which he has reſolved to wage eternal war. When he but touches this ſubject, he loſeth at once his philoſophic compoſure, and ſpeaks with an acrimony unuſual to him on other occaſions. Some thing of this kind appears from the citations already made. But if theſe ſhould not ſatisfy, I ſhall produce one or two more, which certainly will. There is a ſecond ſuppoſition the author makes of a miraculous event, in a certain manner circumſtanced and atteſted, which he declares, and I think with particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, that he would <q>not have the leaſt <hi>inclination</hi> to believe
<note n="†" place="bottom">p. 204. in the note.</note>.</q> At his want of inclination the reader will not be ſurpriſed, when he learns, that this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed miracle is concerning a <hi>reſurrection;</hi> an event
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:022387_0055_0FB8622237718EC8"/>which bears too ſtrong a reſemblance both to the doctrine and to the miracles of holy writ, not to alarm a modern Pyrrhoniſt. To the above declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he ſubjoins, <q>But ſhould this miracle be aſcribed to any new ſyſtem of religion, men in all ages have been ſo much impoſed on by <hi>ridiculous ſtories</hi> of that kind, that this very circumſtance would be a full proof of a cheat, and ſufficient with all men of ſenſe, not only to make them reject the fact, but even <hi>reject it without further examination.</hi>
                  </q> Again, a little after, <q>As the violations of truth are more common in the teſtimony concerning religious mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, than in that concerning any other matter of fact,</q> (a point which the author is poſitive, tho' he neither produceth facts nor arguments to ſupport it) <q>this muſt diminiſh very much the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the former teſtimony, and</q> (pray obſerve his words) <q>
                     <hi>make us form a</hi> GENERAL RESOLUTION, <hi>never to lend any attention to it, with whatever ſpecious pretext it may be covered.</hi>

               <p>Never did the paſſion of an inflamed orator, or the intemperate zeal of a religioniſt, carry him further againſt his adverſary, than this man of ſpeculation is carried by his prejudice againſt religion. Demagogues and bigots have often warned the people againſt liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening to the arguments of an envied and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted rival, leſt by his ſophiſtry they ſhould be ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into the moſt fatal errors. The ſame part this author, a philoſopher, a ſceptic, a diſpaſſionate inquirer after truth, as ſurely he chuſeth to be accounted, now acts in favour of infidelity.

               <p>I had almoſt congratulated Mr Hume, and our enlightened age, on this happy invention, before I reflected, that tho' the application might be new, the expedient itſelf, of reſolving to be deaf to argument, was very ancient, having been often with great ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs employed againſt atheiſts and heretics, and warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recommended by Bellarmine and Scotus, and moſt

               <p>I'm afraid that after ſuch a declaration, I muſt not preſume to conſider myſelf as arguing with the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, who hath, in ſo peremptory a manner, reſolved to attend to nothing that can be ſaid in oppoſition to his theory.

                  </q> whether this conduct would not have afforded great matter of triumph to thoſe gentlemen the deiſts; whether it would not have been conſtrued by them, and even juſtly, into a tacit conviction of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our cauſe, which we were afraid of expoſing
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:022387_0058_0FB862264CF4D560"/>in the light, and bringing to a fair trial. But we ſcorn to take ſhelter in obſcurity, and meanly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the combat; confident as we are, that REASON is our <hi>ally</hi> and our <hi>friend,</hi> and glad to find that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy at length ſo violently ſuſpects her.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt method, by which the author ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts for the fabulous relations of monſters and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies, 'tis freely acknowledged, that the Creator hath implanted in human nature, as a ſpur to the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the underſtanding, a principle of <hi>curioſity,</hi> which makes the mind feel a particular pleaſure in every new acquiſition of knowledge. 'Tis acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged alſo, that as every principle in our nature is liable to abuſe, ſo this principle will often give the mind a bias to the marvellous, for the more marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous any thing is, that is, the more unlike to all that hath formerly been known, the more new it is; and this bias, in many inſtances, may induce belief on inſufficient evidence.</p>
               <p>But the preſumption that hence ariſeth againſt the marvellous is not ſtronger in the caſe of miracles (as will appear from an attentive peruſal of the ſecond ſection) than in the caſe of every fact that is perfectly extraordinary. Yet how eaſily this obſtacle may be overcome by teſtimony, might be illuſtrated, if ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, in almoſt every branch of ſcience, in phyſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, in geography, in hiſtory. On the contrary, what an immenſe impediment would this preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on prove to the progreſs of philoſophy and letters, had it in reality one fiftieth-part of the ſtrength which the author ſeems to attribute to it. I ſhall not tire my reader or myſelf by recurring to the philoſophic
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:022387_0059_0FB86227E94D7C80"/>wonders in electricity, chymiſtry, magnetiſm, which, all the world ſees, may be fully proved to us by te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, before we make the experiments our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>BUT there is, it ſeems, additional to this, a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar preſumpti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> againſt religious miracles. <q>The wiſe,</q> as the author hath obſerved with reaſon, <q>lend a very academic faith to every report, which favours the paſſion of the reporter, whether it magnifies his country, his family, or himſelf, or in any other way ſtrikes in with his natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and propenſities
<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 200.</note>.</q> Now, as no object whatever operates more powerfully on the fancy than <hi>religion</hi> does, or works up the paſſions to a higher fervour; ſo, in matters relating to this ſubject, if in any ſubject, we have reaſon to ſuſpect that the underſtanding will prove a dupe to the paſſions. On this point therefore we ought to be peculiarly cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that we be not haſty of belief. In this ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we all agree.</p>
               <p>But there is one circumſtance, which he hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlooked, and which is nevertheleſs of the greateſt conſequence in the debate. It is this, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice reſulting from the religious affection, may juſt as readily <hi>obſtruct,</hi> as <hi>promote</hi> our faith in a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious miracle. What things in nature are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, than one religion is to another religion? They are juſt as contrary as light and darkneſs, truth and error. The affections, with which they are contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated by the ſame perſon, are juſt as oppoſite, as
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:022387_0060_0FB8622FDD07D2E0"/>deſire and averſion, love and hatred. The ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious zeal which gives the mind of a Chriſtian, a <hi>propenſity</hi> to the belief of a miracle in ſupport of Chriſtianity, will inſpire him with an <hi>averſion</hi> from the belief of a miracle in ſupport of Mahometiſm. The ſame principle, which will make him acquieſce in evidence <hi>leſs</hi> than ſufficient in the one caſe, will make him require evidence <hi>more</hi> than ſufficient in the other.</p>
               <p>Before then the remark of the author can be of any uſe in directing our judgment, as to the evidence of miracles atteſted, we muſt conſider whether the original tenets of the witneſſes would naturally have blaſſed their m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nds in <hi>favour</hi> of the miracles, or in <hi>oppoſition</hi> to them. If the former was the caſe, the teſtimony is ſo much the <hi>leſs</hi> to be regarded; if the latter, ſo much the <hi>more.</hi> Will it ſatisfy on this head to acquaint us, that the prejudices of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes muſt have favoured the miracles, ſince they were zealous promoters of the doctrine, in ſupport of which thoſe miracles are ſaid to have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed? To anſwer thus would be to miſunderſtand the point. The queſtion is, Was this doctrine the faith of the witneſſes, before they ſaw, or fancied they ſaw the miracles? If it was, I agree with him. Great, very great allowance muſt be made for the prejudices of education, for principles, early perhaps, carefully, and deeply roote<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in their minds, and for the religious affection founded in theſe principles; which allowance muſt always derogate from the weight of their teſtimony. But if the faith of the witneſſes ſtood originally in oppoſition to the doctrine
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:022387_0061_0FB8623164CEED88"/>atteſted by the miracles; if the only account that can be given of their converſion, is the conviction which the miracles produced in them; it muſt be a prepoſterous way of arguing, to derive their convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from a religious zeal, which would at firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately withſtand, and for ſome time hinder ſuch conviction. On the contrary, that the evidence ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from miracles performed in proof of a doctrine diſbelieved, and conſequently hated before, did in fact ſurmount that obſtacle, and conquer all the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition ariſing thence, is a very ſtrong preſumption in favour of that evidence: juſt as ſtrong a preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in its favour, as it would have been againſt it, had all their former zeal, and principles, and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, co-operated with the evidence, whatever it was, in gaining an entire aſſent.</p>
               <p>Hence there is the greateſt diſparity in this reſpect, a diſparity which deſerves to be particularly attended to, betwixt the evidence of miracles performed in proof of a religion <hi>to be</hi> eſtabliſhed, and in <hi>contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to opinions generally received; and the evidence of miracles performed in ſupport of a religion <hi>already</hi> eſtabliſhed, and in <hi>confirmation</hi> of opinions generally received. Hence alſo the greateſt diſparity betwixt the miracles recorded by the evangeliſts, and thoſe related by Mariana, Bede, or any monkiſh hiſtorian.</p>
               <p>THERE is then no peculiar preſumption againſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious miracles merely as ſuch; if in certain cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances there is a preſumption againſt them; the preſumption ariſeth ſolely from the circumſtances, inſomuch that, in the oppoſite circumſtances, it is as ſtrongly in their favour.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IN this ſection I propoſe to conſider the reverſe of the queſtion treated in the former. In the former I proved that there is no peculiar preſumption againſt religious miracles; I now inquire whether there be any in their favour. The queſtion is important, and intimately connected with the ſubject.</p>
               <p>THE boldeſt infidel will not deny, that the immortality of the ſoul, a future and eternal ſtate, and the connection of our happineſs or miſery in that ſtate, with our preſent good or bad conduct, not to mention the doctrines concerning the divine unity and perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are tenets which carry no abſurdity in them. They may be true for aught he knows. He diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believes them, not becauſe they are incredible in themſelves, but becauſe he hath not evidence of their truth. He pretends not to diſprove them, nor does he think the taſk incumbent on him. He only pleads, that before he can yield them his aſſent, they muſt be proved.</p>
               <p>Now, as whatever is poſſible, may be ſuppoſed, let us ſuppoſe that the dogmas above mentioned are all infallible truths; and let the unbeliever ſay, whether he can conceive an object worthier of the Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſal, than to reveal theſe truths to mankind? and
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:022387_0063_0FB862344D30B198"/>to enforce them in ſuch a manner, as may give them a ſuitable influence on the heart and life. Of all the inhabitants of the earth, man is incomparably the nobleſt. Whatever therefore regards the intereſt of the human ſpecies, is a grander concern, than what regards either the inanimate or the brute creation. If man was made, as is doubtleſs not impoſſible, for an after ſtate of immorality; whatever relates to that immortal ſtate, or may conduce to prepare him for the fruition of it, muſt be immenſely ſuperior to that which concerns merely the tranſient en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of the preſent life. How ſublime then is the object which religion, and religion only, exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits as the ground of ſupernatural interpoſitions! This object is no other than the intereſt of man, a reaſonable and moral agent, the only being in this lower world which bears in his ſoul the image of his Maker; not the intereſt of an individual, but of the kind; not for a limited duration, but for eternity: an object at leaſt in one reſpect adequate to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of God.</p>
               <p>Does this appear to the eſſayiſt too much like ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing <hi>a priori,</hi> of which I know he hath a deteſtation? It is juſt ſuch an argument, as, preſuppoſing the moſt rational principles of Deiſm, reſults from thoſe max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims concerning intelligent cauſes, and their operations, which are founded in general experience, and which uniformly lead us to expect, that the end will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate to the means. The <hi>Pagans</hi> of Rome had notions of their divinities infinitely inferior to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions concerning God, which in Chriſtian countries are maintained even by thoſe, who, for diſtinction's
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:022387_0064_0FB86236482E3D00"/>ſake, are called DEISTS. Yet ſuch of the former as had any juſtneſs of taſte, were offended with thoſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, who, exhibited the celeſtials on ſlight occaſions, and for trivial purpoſes, interfering in the affairs of men. Why? Becauſe ſuch an exhibition ſhocked all the principles of probability. It had not that veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilitude which is abſolutely neceſſary to render fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion agreeable. Accordingly it is a precept, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the machinery of the drama, given by one who was both a critic and a poet, <hi>That a god muſt never be introduced, unleſs to accompliſh ſome important deſign which could not be otherwiſe effectuated</hi>

               <head>SECTION VI. <hi>Inquiry into the meaning and propriety of one of Mr Hume's favourite maxims.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THERE is a method truly curious, ſuggeſted by the author, for extricating the mind, ſhould the evidence from teſtimony be ſo great, that its falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:022387_0065_0FB86238077EA3E0"/>might, as he terms it, be accounted miraculous. In this puzzling caſe, when a man is ſo beſet with miracles, that he is under a neceſſity of admitting one, he muſt always take care it be the ſmalleſt; for it is an <hi>axiom</hi> in this writers DIALECTIC, That <hi>the probability of the fact is in the inverſe ratio of the quantity of miracle there is in it.</hi> "I weigh," ſays he, <q>the one miracle againſt the other, and according to the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority which I diſcover, I pronounce my deciſion, and always reject the greater miracle
<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 182.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now, of this method, which will no doubt be thought by many to be very ingenious, and which appears to the eſſayiſt both very momentous and very perſpicuous, I own, I am not able to diſcover either the reaſonableneſs or the uſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I cannot ſee the reaſonableneſs. 'A miracle,' to adopt his own definition, <q>implies the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</q> or rather the ſuſpenſion, <q>of ſome law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and that either by a particular volition of the Deity, or by the interpoſal of ſome inviſible agent
<note n="†" place="bottom">Ib. in the note.</note>.</q> Now, as I ſhould think, from the principles laid down in the preceding ſection, that it would be for no trifling purpoſe, that the laws of nature would be ſuſpended, and either the Deity or an inviſible agent would interpoſe; 'tis on the ſame principles, natural to imagine, that the means, or miracle performed, ſhould bear a proportion in reſpect of dignity and greatneſs, to the end propoſed. Were I therefore under ſuch a neceſſity as is ſuppoſed by Mr Hume, of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:022387_0066_0FB8623F77A85A20"/>the truth of a miracle, I acknowledge, that of two contradictory miracles, where all other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are equal, I ſhould think it reaſonable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the greater. I ſhall borrow an illuſtration from the author himſelf. "A miracle," he ſays, <q>may either be <hi>diſcoverable</hi> by men or not. This alters not its nature and eſſence. The raiſing of a houſe or ſhip into the air is a viſible miracle; the raiſing of a feather, when the wind wants <hi>ever ſo little</hi> of a force requiſite for that purpoſe is as real a miracle, tho' not ſo <hi>ſenſible</hi> with regard to us
<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 182. in the note.</note>.</q> Surely if any miracle may be called <hi>little,</hi> the laſt mentioned is intitled to that denomination, not only becauſe it is an <hi>undiſcoverable</hi> and <hi>inſenſible</hi> miracle, but becauſe the quantum of miraculous force requiſite, is, by the hypotheſis, <hi>ever ſo little,</hi> or the leaſt conceivable. Yet if it were certain, that God, angel, or ſpirit, were, for one of thoſe purpoſes, to interpoſe in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending the laws of nature; I believe moſt men would join with me in thinking, that it would be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the raiſing of a <hi>houſe</hi> or <hi>ſhip</hi> than for the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of a <hi>feather.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But though the maxim laid down by the author were juſt, I cannot diſcover in what inſtance, or by what application, it can be rendered of any utility. Why? Becauſe we have no rule, whereby we can judge of the greatneſs of miracles. I allow, that in ſuch a ſingular inſtance, as that above quoted from the eſſay, we may judge ſafely enough. But that can be of no practical uſe. In almoſt every caſe that
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:022387_0067_0FB86240F8404C90"/>will occur, I may warrantably aver, that it will be impoſſible for the acuteſt intellect to decide, which of the two is the greater miracle. As to the author, I cannot find that he has favoured us with any light in ſo important and ſo critical a queſtion. Have we not then ſome reaſon to dread, that the taſk will not be leſs difficult to furniſh us with a <hi>meaſure,</hi> by which we can determine the magnitude of miracles; than to provide us with a <hi>balance,</hi> by which we can aſcertain the comparative weight of teſtimonies and experiences?</p>
               <p>If leaving the ſpeculations of the eſſayiſt, we ſhall, in order to be aſſiſted on this ſubject, recur to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and deciſions: let us conſider the miracle which was recited in the third ſection, and which he declares, would, on the evidence of ſuch teſtimony as he ſuppoſes, not only be probable, but certain. For my part, 'tis not in my power to conceive a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter miracle than that is. The whole univerſe is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by it; the earth, the ſun, the moon, the ſtars. The moſt invariable laws of nature with which we are acquainted, even thoſe which regulate the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the heavenly bodies, and diſpenſe darkneſs and light to worlds, are violated. I appeal to the author himſelf, whether it could be called a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or even ſo great a miracle, that all the writers at that time, or even all mankind, had been ſeized with a new ſpecies of epidemical delirium, which had given riſe to this ſtrange illuſion. But in this the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is remarkably unfortunate, that the principles by which he in fact regulates his judgment and belief,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:022387_0068_0FB86241C973D0A8"/>are often the reverſe of thoſe which he endeavours to eſtabliſh in his theory.</p>
               <p>SHALL I hazard a conjecture? It is, that the word <hi>miracle,</hi> as thus uſed by the author, is uſed in a vague and improper ſenſe, as a ſynonymous term for <hi>improbable;</hi> and that believing the <hi>leſs,</hi> and reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>greater miracle,</hi> denote ſimply believing what is <hi>leaſt,</hi> and rejecting what is <hi>moſt improbable;</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſtill more explicitly believing what we think <hi>moſt worthy of belief,</hi> and rejecting what we think <hi>leaſt worthy.</hi> I am aware, on a ſecond peruſal of the author's words, that my talent in gueſſing may be juſtly queſtioned. He hath in effect told us himſelf what he means. "When any one," ſays he, <q>tells me, that he ſaw a dead man reſtored to life, I immediately conſider with myſelf, whether it be more <hi>probable,</hi> that this perſon ſhould either deceive or be deceived, or that the fact he relates, ſhould really have happened. I weigh the one <hi>miracle</hi> againſt the other; and according to the ſuperiority which I diſcover, I pronounce my deciſion, and always reject the greater miracle. If the falſehood of his teſtimony would be more miraculous than the event which he relates; then, and not till then, can he pretend to command my belief or opinion
<note n="*" place="bottom">182.</note>.</q> At firſt indeed one is ready to exclaim, What a ſtrange <hi>revolution</hi> is here! The belief of miracles then, even by Mr Hume's account, is abſolutely inevitable. Miracles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves too, ſo far from being impoſſible, or even extraordinary, are the commoneſt things in nature;
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:022387_0069_0FB86243DF68E4C0"/>ſo common, that when any miraculous fact is atteſted to us, we are equally under a neceſſity of believing a miracle, whether we believe the fact, or deny it. The whole difference between the eſſayiſt and us, is at length reduced to this ſingle point, Whether greater or ſmaller miracles are intitled to the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. This myſtery however vaniſhes on a nearer inſpection. The ſtyle, we find, is figurative, and the author is all the while amuſing both his readers and himſelf with an unuſual application of a familiar term. What is called the weighing of <hi>probabilities</hi> in one ſentence, is the weighing of <hi>miracles</hi> in the next. If it were aſked, For what reaſon did not Mr Hume expreſs his ſentiment in ordinary and proper words? I could only anſwer, I know no reaſon but one, and that is, To give the appearance of novelty and depth to one of thoſe very harmleſs propoſitions, which by philoſophers are called <hi>identical,</hi> and which, to ſay the truth, need ſome diſguiſe, to make them paſs upon the world with tolerable decency.</p>
               <p>What then ſhall be ſaid of the concluſion which he gives as the ſum and quinteſſence of the firſt part of the eſſay? The beſt thing for aught I know, that can be ſaid, is, that it contains a moſt certain truth, tho' at the ſame time the leaſt ſignificant, that ever perhaps was uſhered into the world with ſo much ſolemnity. In order, therefore, to make <hi>plainer Engliſh</hi> of his <hi>plain conſequence,</hi> let us only change the word <hi>miraculous,</hi> as applyed to the falſehood of human teſtimony, into <hi>improbable,</hi> which in this paſſage is entirely equivalent, and obſerve the effect produced
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:022387_0070_0FB862476FEBAF58"/>by this elucidation. <q>The plain conſequence is, and 'tis a GENERAL MAXIM, <hi>worthy of our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,</hi> That NO TESTIMONY IS SUFFICIENT TO ESTABLISH A MIRACLE; UNLESS THE TESTIMONY BE OF SUCH A KIND, THAT ITS FALSEHOOD WOULD BE MORE IMPROBABLE, THAN THE FACT WHICH IT ENDEAVOURS TO ESTABLISH

               </head>
               <p>FROM what hath been evinced in the fourth and fifth ſections of the former part, with regard to religion in general, <hi>two corollaries</hi> are clearly deducible in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Chriſtianity. <hi>One</hi> is, That the preſumption ariſing from the dignity of the end, to ſay the leaſt of it, can in no religion be pleaded with greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, than in the Chriſtian. <hi>The other</hi> is, That the preſumption ariſing from the religious affection, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of weakening, corroborates the evidence of the goſpel. The faith of Jeſus was promulgated, and gained ground, not with the aſſiſtance, but in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance, of all the religious zeal and prejudices of the times.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="unknown:022387_0072_0FB8625011DB74F8"/>
IN order to invalidate the <hi>ſecond</hi> corollary, it will poſſibly be urged, that proſelytes to a new religion, may be gained at firſt; either by addreſs and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, or by the appearances of uncommon ſanctity, and rapturous fervours of devotion; that if once people have commenced proſelytes, the tranſition to enthuſiaſm is almoſt unavoidable; and that enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm will fully account for the utmoſt pitch both of credulity and falſeneſs.</p>
               <p>Admitting that a few converts might be made by the aforeſaid arts, it is ſubverſive of all the laws of probability, to imagine, that the ſtrongeſt prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, fortified with that vehement abhorence which contradiction in religions principles rarely ſails to excite, ſhould be ſo eaſily vanquiſhed in multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes. Beſides, the very pretext of ſupporting the doctrine by miracles, if a falſe pretext, would of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity do unſpeakable hurt to the cauſe. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of miracles will quickly attract the attention of all to whom the new doctrine is publiſhed. The influence which addreſs and eloquence, appearances of ſanctity and fervours of devotion, would otherwiſe have had, however great, will be ſuperſeded by the conſideration of what is infinitely more ſtriking and deciſive. The miracles will therefore firſt be can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſſed, and canvaſſed with a temper of mind the moſt unfavourable to conviction. 'Tis not ſolely on the teſtimony of the evangeliſts that Chriſtians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the goſpel, tho' that teſtimony appears in all reſpects ſuch as merits the higheſt regard; but it is on the ſucceſs of the goſpel; it is on the teſtimony, as we may juſty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the numberleſs proſelytes
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:022387_0073_0FB8625191AB25C8"/>that were made to a religon, oppoſing all the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous profeſſions then in the world, and appealing, for the ſatisfaction of every body, to the viſible and miraculous interpoſition of Heaven in its favour. The witneſſes conſidered in this light, and in this light they ought to be conſidered, will be found more than 'a ſufficient number:' and tho' perhaps there were few of them, what the author would deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate 'men of education and learning;' yet, which is more eſſential, they were generally men of good ſenſe, and knowledge enough to ſecure them againſt all deluſion, as to thoſe plain facts for which they gave their teſtimony; men who, (in the common acceptation of the words) neither did, nor could derive to themſelves either intereſt or honour by their atteſtations, but did thereby, on the contrary, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently abandon all hopes of both.</p>
               <p>It deſerves alſo to be remembered, that there is here no contradictory teſtimony, notwithſtanding that both the founder of our religion, and his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, were from the firſt ſurrounded by inveterate enemies, who never <q>eſteemed the matter too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable to deſerve their attention or regard;</q> and who, as they could not want the means, gave evident proofs that they wanted not the inclination to detect the fraud, if there had been any fraud to be detected. They were jealous of their own reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and authority, and foreſaw but too clearly, that the ſucceſs of Jeſus would give a fatal blow to both. As to the teſtimonies themſelves, we may permit the author to try them by his own rules
<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 173.</note>.
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:022387_0074_0FB86253CB3B84D0"/>There is here no oppoſition of teſtimony; there is no apparent ground of ſuſpicion from the character of the witneſſes; there is no intereſt which they could have in impoſing on the world; there is not a ſmall number of witneſſes, they are innumerable. Do the hiſtorians of our Lord deliver their teſtimony with doubt and heſitation? Do they fall into the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite extreme of uſing too violent aſſeverations? So far from both, that the moſt amazing inſtances of divine power, and the moſt intereſting events, are related without any cenſure or reflection of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters on perſons, parties, actions, or opinions; with ſuch an unparallelled and unaffected ſimplicity, as demonſtrates, that they were neither themſelves ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by paſſion like enthuſiaſts, nor had any deſign of working on the paſſions of their readers. The greateſt miracles are recorded, with as little appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance either of doubt or wonder in the writer, and with as little ſuſpicion of the reader's incredulity, as the moſt ordinary incidents: A manner as unlike that of impoſtors as of enthuſiaſts; a manner in which thoſe writers are altogether ſingular; and I will add a manner which can on no ſuppoſion be tolerably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for, but that of the truth, and not of the truth only, but of the notoriety, of the events which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. They ſpoke like people, who had themſelves been long familiarized to ſuch acts of omnipotence and grace. They ſpoke like people, who knew that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the moſt marvellous actions they related, had been ſo publicly performed, and in the preſence of multitudes alive at the time of their writing, as to be uncontrovertible, and as in fact not to have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:022387_0075_0FB86255D5ABA350"/>even by their bittereſt foes. They could bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeal on this head to their enemies. <hi>A man,</hi> ſay they, ſpaking of their maſter
<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts ii. 22.</note>, <hi>approved of God among you, by miracles and wonders and ſigns, which God did by him in the midſt of you, as</hi> YE YOURSELVES ALSO KNOW The objections of Chriſt's perſecutors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his doctrine, thoſe objections alſo which regard the nature of his miracles, are, together with his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, faithfully recorded by the ſacred hiſtorians; 'tis ſtrange, if the occaſion had been given, that we have not the remoteſt hint of any objections againſt the reality of his miracles, and a confutation of thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.</p>
               <p>BUT paſſing the manner in which the firſt proſelytes may be gained to a new religion, and ſuppoſing ſome actually gained, no matter how to the faith of Jeſus; can it be eaſily accounted for, that, even with the help of thoſe early converts, this religion ſhould have been propagated in the world, on the <hi>falſe</hi> pretence of miracles? Nothing more eaſily, ſays the author. Thoſe original propagators of the goſpel have been deceived themſelves; for <q>a religioniſt may be an <hi>enthuſiaſt,</hi> and imagine he ſees what has no reality
<note n="†" place="bottom">p. 185.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Were this admitted, it would not in the preſent caſe, remove the difficulty. He muſt not only himſelf imagine he ſees what has no reality, he muſt make every body preſent, thoſe who are no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts, nor even friends, nay he muſt make enemies alſo imagine they ſee the ſame thing which he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:022387_0076_0FB8625A4A739D08"/>he ſees; for the miracles of Jeſus were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acknowledged by thoſe who perſecuted him.</p>
               <p>That an <hi>enthuſiaſt</hi> is very liable to be impoſed on, in whatever favours the particular ſpecies of enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm, with which he is affected, none, who knows any thing of the human heart, will deny. But ſtill this frailty hath its limits. For my own part, I cannot find examples of any, even among enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts, (unleſs to the conviction of every body they were diſtracted) who did not ſee and hear in the ſame manner as other people. Many of this tribe have miſtaken the reveries of a heated imagination, for the communications of the Divine Spirit, who never, in one ſingle inſtance, miſtook the operations of their external ſenſes. Without marking this difference, we ſhould make no diſtinction between the <hi>enthuſiaſtic</hi> character and the <hi>frantic,</hi> which are in themſelves evidently diſtinct. How ſhall we then account from <hi>enthuſiaſm,</hi> for the teſtimony given by the apoſtles, concerning the reſurrection of their maſter, and his aſcenſion into heaven, not to mention innumerable other facts? In theſe it was impoſſible that any, who in the uſe of their reaſon were but one remove from <hi>Bedlamites,</hi> ſhould have been deceived. Yet, in the preſent caſe, the unbeliever muſt even ſay more than this, and, accumulating abſurdity upon abſurdity, muſt affirm, that the apoſtles were deceived as to the reſurrection and aſcenſion of their maſter, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that they themſelves had concerted the plan of ſtealing his body, and concealing it.</p>
               <p>BUT this is not the only reſource of the infidel. If he is driven from this ſtrong hold, he can take refuge
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:022387_0077_0FB8625D789D39A0"/>in another. Admit the apoſtles were not deceived themſelves, they may nevertheleſs have been, thro' mere devotion and benevolence, incited to deceive the reſt of mankind. The religioniſt, rejoins the author, <q>may know his narration to be falſe, and yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in it, with the beſt intentions in the world, for the ſake of promoting ſo holy a cauſe
<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 185.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Our religion, to uſe its own nervous language, teacheth us
<note n="†" place="bottom">Job. xiii. 7, 8.</note>, that we ought not to lie, or <hi>ſpeak wickedly,</hi> not even <hi>for God;</hi> that we ought not to <hi>accept his perſon</hi> in judgment, or <hi>talk,</hi> or act <hi>deceitfully for him.</hi> But ſo very little, it muſt be owned, has this ſentiment been attended to, even in the Chriſtian world, that one would almoſt think, it contained a ſtrain of virtue too ſublime for the apprehenſion of the multitude. 'Tis therefore a fact not to be queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, that little pious frauds, as they are abſurdly, not to ſay impiouſly, called, have been often prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed by ignorant zealots in ſupport of a cauſe, which they firmly believed to be both true and holy. But in all ſuch caſes the truth and holineſs of the cauſe are wholly independent of thoſe artifices. A perſon may be perſuaded of the former, who is too clear-ſighted to be deceived by the latter: for even a full conviction of the truth of the cauſe is not, in the leaſt, inconſiſtent with either the conſciouſneſs, or the detection of the frauds uſed in ſupport of it. In the Romiſh church, for example, there are many zealous and orthodox believers, who are nevertheleſs incapable of being impoſed on by the lying wonders, which ſome of their clergy have exhibited. The cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:022387_0078_0FB8625F0F7A43D8"/>of the apoſtles were widely different from the circumſtances, either of thoſe believers, or of their clergy. Some of the miraculous events which the apoſtles atteſted, were not only the <hi>evidences,</hi> but the diſtinguiſhing <hi>doctrines</hi> of the religion which they taught. There is therefore in their caſe an abſolute inconſiſtency betwix a conviction of the truth of the cauſe, and the conſciouſneſs of the frauds uſed in ſupport of it. Thoſe frauds themſelves, if I may ſo expreſs my ſelf, conſtituted the very eſſence of the cauſe. What were the tenets, by which they were diſtinguiſhed, in their religious ſyſtem, particularly from the Phariſees, who owned not only the unity and perfections of the Godhead, the exiſtence of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and demons, but the general reſurrection, and future ſtate of rewards and puniſhments? Were not theſe their peculiar tenets, That <q>Jeſus, whom the Jews and Romans joined in crucifying without the gates of Jeruſalem, had ſuffered that ignominious death, to make atonement for the ſins of men
<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. v. 6. &amp;c.</note>? that, in teſtimony of this, and of the divine acceptance, God hath raiſed him from the dead? that he had exalted him to his own right hand, to be a prince and a ſaviour, to give repentance to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the remiſſion of their ſins
<note n="†" place="bottom">Acts ii. 32. &amp;c. v. 30. &amp;c. x. 40. &amp;c.</note>? that he is now our advocate with the father
<note n="‡" place="bottom">1 John ii. 1.</note>? that he will deſcend from heaven at the laſt day, to judge the world in righteouſneſs
<note n="§" place="bottom">Acts x. 42. xvii. 31.</note>, and to receive his faithful diſciples into heaven, to be forever with himſelf
<note n="‖" place="bottom">John xiv. 3.</note>?</q> Theſe fundamental articles of their ſyſtem, they
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:022387_0079_0FB862608E6326B8"/>muſt have known, deſerved no better appellation than a ſtring of lies, if we ſuppoſe them liars in the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony they gave of the reſurrection and aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their maſter. If, agreeably to the Jewiſh hypotheſis, they had, in a moſt wonderful and daring manner, ſtole by night the corpſe from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, that on the falſe report of his reſurrection, they might found the ſtupendous fabrick they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected among themſelves, how was it poſſible they ſhould conceive the cauſe to be either true or holy? They muſt have known, that in thoſe cardinal points, on which all depends, they were falſe witneſſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God, wilful corrupters of the religion of their country, and public, though indeed diſintereſted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiaries, whitherſoever they went. They could not therefore enjoy even that poor ſolace, <q>that the end will ſanctify the means:</q> a ſolace with which the monk or anchoret ſilences the remoſtrances of his conſcience, when in defence of a religion which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards as certain, he, by ſome pitiful juggler-trick, impoſeth on the credulity of the rabble. On the contrary, the whole ſcheme of the apoſtles muſt have been, and not only muſt have been, but muſt have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to themſelves, a moſt audacious freedom with their Maker, a villainous impoſition on the world, and I will add, a moſt fooliſh and ridiculous project of heaping ruin and diſgrace upon themſelves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the proſpect of any compenſation in the preſent life, or reverſion in the future.</p>
               <p>ONCE more, can we account for ſo extraordinary a phenomenon, by attributing it to that moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:022387_0080_0FB862621DAED0E0"/>of all motives, as the author thinks it
<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 200.</note>, <q>an ambition to attain ſo ſublime a character, as that of a miſſionary, a prophet, an ambaſſador from heaven?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Not to mention, that ſuch a towering ambition was but ill adapted to the mean rank, poor education, and habitual circumſtances, of ſuch men as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles moſtly had been; a deſire of that kind, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever wonders it may effectuate when ſupported by enthuſiaſm, and faith, and zeal, muſt ſoon have been cruſhed by the outward, and to human appearance inſurmountable difficulties and diſtreſſes they had to encounter; when quite unſupported from within by either faith, or hope, or the teſtimony of a good conſcience; rather, I ſhould have ſaid, when they themſelves were haunted from within by a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the blackeſt guilt, impiety, and baſeneſs. Strange indeed it muſt be owned without a parrallel that in ſuch a cauſe, and in ſuch circumſtances, not only one, but all, ſhould have the reſolution to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere to the laſt, in ſpite of infamy and torture; and that no one among ſo many confederates; ſhould be induced to betray the dreadful ſecret.</p>

               <p>THE eſſayiſt is confident, that all the evidence reſulting hence is on his ſide. Nay ſo unqueſtionable a truth does this appear to him, that he never attempts to prove it: he always preſuppoſeth it, as a point univerſally acknowledged. 'Men in all ages,' we learn from a paſſage already quoted, <q>have been much impoſed on, by ridiculous ſtories of miracles aſcribed to new ſyſtems of religion
<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 204. in the note.</note>.</q> Again he aſſerts, that <q>the violations of truth are more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the teſtimony concerning miracles, than in that concerning any other religious matter of fact
<note n="†" place="bottom">p. 205 in the note.</note>.</q> Theſe aſſertions, however, tho' uſed for the ſame purpoſe, the attentive reader will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, are far from conveying the ſame ſenſe, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of equal weight in the argument. The difference hath been marked in the fourth ſection of the firſt part of this tract. The oracular predictions among the ancient Pagans, and the pretended wonders per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:022387_0082_0FB862650A93BF98"/>by capuchins and friars, by itinerant or ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary teachers among the Roman Catholics, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor will doubtleſs reckon among religious miracles; but he can with no propriety denominate them, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles aſcribed to a new ſyſtem of religion
<note n="†" place="bottom">Should the author inſiſt, that ſuch miracles are nevertheleſs meant to eſtabliſh, if not a new ſyſtem, at leaſt ſome <hi>new point</hi> of religion; that thoſe which are wrought in Spain, for example, are not intended as proofs of the goſpel, but as proofs of the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of a particular <hi>crucifix</hi> or <hi>relic;</hi> which is always a new point, or at leaſt not univerſally received: I muſt beg the reader will conſider, what is the meaning of this expreſſion, <hi>a new point of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> It is not <hi>a new ſyſtem,</hi> 'tis not even <hi>a new doctrine.</hi> We know, that one article of faith in the church of Rome is, that the images and relics of ſaints ought to be worſhipped. We know alſo, that in proof of this article, 'tis one of their principal argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that miracles are wrought by means of ſuch relics and i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages.

Now, 'tis with thoſe of the claſs laſt mentioned, and with thoſe only, that I am concerned; for 'tis only to them that the miracles wrought in proof of chriſtianity bear any analogy.</p>
               <p>I ſhall then examine impartially this bold aſſertion, That <q>men in all ages have been much impoſed on,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:022387_0083_0FB8626A788EE5A8"/>by ridiculous ſtories of miracles aſcribed to new ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tems of religion.</q> For my part, I am fully ſatisfied, that there is not the ſhadow of truth in it: and I am utterly at a loſs to conceive what could induce an author ſo well verſed in the annals both of ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern times as Mr Hume, in ſuch a poſitive manner to advance it. I believe it will require no elaborate diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition to evince, that theſe two, JUDAISM and CHRISTANITY, are of all that have ſubſiſted, or now ſubſiſt in the world, the only religions, which claim to have been attended in their firſt publication with the evidence of <hi>miracles.</hi> It deſerves alſo to be remarked, that it is more in conformity to common language, and incidental diſtinctions which have ariſen, than to ſtrict propriety, that I call Judaiſm and Chriſtanity, two religions. 'Tis true, the Jewiſh creed, in the days of our Saviour, having been corrupted by rabbinical tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, ſtood in many reſpects, and at this day ſtands in direct oppoſition to the Goſpel. But it is not in this acceptation that I uſe the word Judaiſm. Such a creed, I am ſenſible, we can no more denominate the doctrine of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> than we can denominate the creed of Pope Pius the doctrine of the <hi>New.</hi> And truly the fate which both inſtitutions, that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> have met with among men, hath been in many reſpects extremely ſimilar. But when, on the contrary, we conſider the religion of the Jews, not as the ſyſtem of faith and practice, which preſently obtains, or heretofore hath obtained among that people; but ſolely as the religion that is revealed in <hi>the law and the prophets,</hi> we muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that in this inſtitution are contained the rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:022387_0084_0FB8626C90C07F78"/>of the goſpel. The ſame great plan carried on by the Divine Providence, for the recovery and final happineſs of mankind, is the ſubject of both diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations. They are by conſequence cloſely connected. In the former we are acquainted with the <hi>occaſion</hi> and <hi>riſe,</hi> in the latter more ſully with the <hi>progreſs</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion</hi> of this benign ſcheme. 'Tis for this reaſon that the ſcriptures of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> which alone contain the authentic religion of the SYNAGOGUE, have ever been acknowledged in the CHURCH, an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential part of the <hi>goſpel-revelation.</hi> The apoſtles and evangeliſts in every part of their writings, preſuppoſe the truth of the Moſaic economy, and often found both their doctrine and arguments upon it. 'Tis therefore, I affirm, only in proof of this one ſeries of revelations, that the aid of miracles hath with ſucceſs been pretended to.</p>
               <p>CAN the PAGAN religion, can, I ſhould rather ſay, any of the numberleſs religions (for they are totally diſtinct) known by the common name of <hi>Pagan,</hi> produce any claim of this kind that will me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit our attention? If the author knows of any, I wiſh he had mentioned it; for in all antiquity, as far as my acquaintance with it reacheth, I can recollect no ſuch claim. However, that I may not, on the one hand, appear to paſs the matter too ſlightly; or, on the other, loſe myſelf, as Mr Hume expreſſes it, in too wide a field; I ſhall briefly conſider, whether the ancient religions of <hi>Greece</hi> or <hi>Rome</hi> (which of all the ſpecies of heatheniſh ſuperſtition are on many ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts the moſt remarkable) can preſent a claim of this nature. Will it be ſaid, that that monſtrous
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:022387_0085_0FB8626E4E485B58"/>heap of fables we find in ancient bards, relating to the genealogy, productions, amours, and atchievements, of the gods, are the miracles on which Greek and Roman Paganiſm claims to be founded?</p>
               <p>If one ſhould talk in this manner, I muſt remind him, <hi>firſt,</hi> that theſe are by no means exhibited as EVIDENCES, but as the THEOLOGY itſelf; the poets always uſing the ſame affirmative ſtyle concerning what paſſed in heaven, in hell, and in the ocean, where men could not be ſpectators, as concerning what paſſed upon the earth: <hi>ſecondly,</hi> that all thoſe mythological tales are confeſſedly recorded many cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies after they are ſuppoſed to have happened; no voucher, no teſtimony, nothing that can deſerve the name of evidence having been produced, or even al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, in proof of them; <hi>thirdly,</hi> that the intention of the writers ſeems to be ſolely the amuſement, not the conviction of their readers; that accordingly no writer ſcruples to model the mythology to his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular taſte, or rather caprice; but conſidering this as a province ſubject to the laws of Parnaſſus, all agree in arrogating here the immemorial privilege of poets, to ſay and feign, unqueſtioned, what they pleaſe; and <hi>fourthly,</hi> that at leaſt ſeveral of their narrations are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorical, and as plainly intended to convey ſome phyſical or moral inſtruction, as any of the apologues of Aeſop. But to have ſaid even thus much in refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſo abſurd a plea, will perhaps to many readers appear ſuperfluous.</p>
               <p>LEAVING therefore the endleſs abſurdities and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherent fictions of idolaters, I ſhall inquire, in the next place, whether the MAHOMETAN worſhip
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:022387_0086_0FB8626F92804848"/>(which in its ſpeculative principles appears more rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal) pretends to have been built on the evidence of miracles.</p>
               <p>Mahomet, the founder of this profeſſion, openly and frequently, as all the world knows, diſclaimed ſuch evidence. He frankly owned that he had no commiſſion nor power to work miracles, being ſent of God to the people only as a preacher. Not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed but that there are things mentioned in the revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he pretended to give them, which, if true, would have been miraculous; ſuch are the nocturnal viſits of the angel Gabriel, (not unlike thoſe ſecret inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>views, which Numa, the inſtitutor of the Roman rites, affirmed that he had with the goddeſs Egeria) his getting from time to time parcels of the uncreated book tranſmitted to him from heaven, and his moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing night-journey. But theſe miracles could be no evidences of his miſſion. Why? Becauſe no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was witneſs to them. On the contrary, it was becauſe his adherents had previouſly and implicitly believed his apoſtleſhip, that they admitted things ſo incredible, on his bare declaration. There is indeed one miracle, and but one, which he urgeth againſt the infidels, as the main ſupport of his cauſe; a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, for which even we, in this diſtant region and period, have not only the evidence of teſtimony, but, if we pleaſe to uſe it, all the evidence which the contemporaries and countrymen of this military a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ever enjoyed. The miracle I mean is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt divinity, or ſupernatural excellence, of the ſcriptures which he gave them; a miracle, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:022387_0087_0FB862712947DF00"/>which I ſhall only ſay, that as it falls not under the cogniſance of the ſenſes, but of a much more fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible tribunal, taſte in compoſition, and critical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, ſo a principle of leſs efficacy than enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm, even the ſlighteſt partiality, may make a man, in this particular, imagine he perceives what hath no reality. Certain it is, that notwithſtanding the many defiances which the prophet gave his enemies ſometimes to produce ten chapters, ſometimes one, that could bear to be compared with an equal portion of the perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picuous book
<note n="*" place="bottom">Alcoran. The chapter—of the cow,—of Jonas,—of Hud.</note>, they ſeem not in the leaſt to have been convinced, that there was any thing miraculous in the matter. Nay this ſublime performance, ſo highly venerated by every Muſſulman, they were not afraid to blaſpheme as contemptible, calling it, <q>A confuſed heap of dreams,</q> and the ſilly fables of "ancient times
<note n="†" place="bottom">—Of cattle,—of the ſpoils,—of the prophets. That the Alcoran bears a very ſtrong reſemblance to the Talmud is indeed evident; but I hardly think, we can have a more ſtriking inſtance of the prejudices of modern infidels, than in their comparing this motley compoſition to the writings of the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Let the reader but take the trouble to peruſe the hiſtory of Joſeph by Mahomet, which is the ſubject of a very long chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to compare it with the account of that patriarch given by Moſes, and if he doth not perceive at once the immenſe inferio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the former, I ſhall never, for my part, undertake by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to convince him of it. To me it appears even almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, that the moſt beautiful and moſt affecting paſſages of holy writ, ſhould be ſo wretchedly disfigured by a writer whoſe intention, we are certain was not to burleſque them. But that every reader may be qualified to form ſome notion of this mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of a book, I have ſubjoined a ſpecimen of it, from the chapter of <hi>the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

I have not ſelected this paſſage on account of any ſpecial futility to be found in it, for the like abſurdities may be obſerved in every page of the performance; but I have ſelected it, becauſe it is ſhort, and becauſe it contains a diſtinct ſtory which bears ſome relation to a paſſage of ſcripture. I uſe Mr Sale's verſion, which is the lateſt and the moſt approved, omitting only, for the ſake of brevity, ſuch ſupplementary expreſſions, as have been without neceſſity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by the tranſlator. <q>Solomon was David's heir; and he ſaid, O men, we have been taught the ſpeech of birds, and have had all things beſtowed on us; this is manifeſt excellence. And his armies were gathered together to Solomon, conſiſting of genii, and men, and birds; and they were led in diſtinct <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ands, till they came to the valley of ants. An ant ſaid, O ants, enter ye into your habitations, leſt Solomon and his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my tread you under foot and perceive it not. He ſmiled, laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at her words, and ſaid, O Lord, excite me, that I may be thankful for thy favour, wherewith thou haſt favoured me, and my parents; and that I may do that which is right and well pleaſing to thee: and introduce me, thro' thy mercy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thy ſervants the righteous. And he viewed the birds, and ſaid, What is the reaſon that I ſee not the lapwing? Is ſhe abſent? Verily I will chaſtiſe her with a ſevere chaſtiſement, or I will put her to death; unleſs ſhe bring me a juſt excuſe. And ſhe tarried not long, and ſaid, I have viewed that which thou haſt not viewed; and I come to thee from Saba, with a certain piece of news. I found a woman to reign over them, who is provided with every thing, and hath a magnificent throne. I ſound her and her people to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the ſun, beſides God: and Satan hath prepared their works for them, and hath turned them aſide from the way, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not directed) leſt they ſhould worſhip God, who bringeth to light that which is hidden in heaven and earth, and knoweth whatever they conceal, and whatever they diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. God! there is no God but he; the Lord of the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent throne. He ſaid, We ſhall ſee whether thou haſt ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the truth or whether thou art a liar. Go with this my letter, and caſt it down to them; then turn aſide from them, and wait for their anſwer. The queen ſaid, O nobles, verily an honourable letter hath been delivered to me; it is from So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, and this is the tenour thereof. <hi>In the name of the moſt merciful God, riſe not up againſt me: but come, and ſurrender your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to me.</hi> She ſaid, O nobles, adviſe me in my buſineſs: I will not reſolve on any thing, till ye be witneſs thereof. They anſwered, We are endued with ſtrength, and endued with great proweſs in war; but the command appertaineth to thee: ſee therefore what thou wilt command. She ſaid, Verily kings, when they enter a city, waſte the ſame, and abaſe the moſt powerful of the inhabitants thereof: and ſo will theſe do. But I will ſend gifts to them: and will wait for what thoſe who ſhall be ſent, ſhall bring back. And when the embaſſador came to Solomon, that prince ſaid, Will ye preſent me with riches? Verily that which God hath given me is better than what he hath given you: but ye glory in your gifts. Return to your people. We will ſurely come to them with forces which they ſhall not be able to withſtand; and we will drive them out humbled; and they ſhall be contemptible. And So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon ſaid, O nobles, which of you will bring me her throne, before they come and ſurrender themſelves to me? A terrible genius anſwered, I will bring it thee, before thou ariſe from thy place. And one with whom was the knowledge of the ſcripture ſaid, I will bring it to thee, in the twinkling of an eye. And when Solomon ſaw it placed before him, he ſaid, This is a favour of my Lord, that he may make trial of me, whether I will be grateful, or whether I will be ungrateful: and he who is grateful, is grateful to his own advantage; but if any ſhall be ungrateful, verily my Lord is ſelf-ſufficient and munificent. And he ſaid, Alter her throne that ſhe may not know it, to the end we may ſee whether ſhe be directed, or whether ſhe be of thoſe who are not directed. And when ſhe was come, it was ſaid, Is thy throne like this? She anſwered, As though it were the ſame. And we have had knowledge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on us before this, and have been reſigned. But that which ſhe worſhipped beſides God, had turned her aſide, for ſhe was of an unbelieving people. It was ſaid to her, Enter the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. And when ſhe ſaw it, ſhe imagined it to be a great wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſhe diſcovered her legs. Solomon ſaid, Verily this is a palace, evenly floored with glaſs. She ſaid, O Lord, verily I have dealt unjuſtly with my own ſoul; and I reſign myſelf together with Solomon, to God, the Lord of all creatures.</q> Thus poverty of ſentiment, monſtroſity of invention, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways betokens a diſtempered not a rich imagination, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of diction the moſt turgid verboſity, ſo apt to be miſtaken by perſons of a viciated taſte for true ſublimity, are the genuine characteriſtics of the book. They appear almoſt in every line. The very titles and epithets aſſigned to god not exempt from them. The Lord of the daybreak, the Lord of the magnificent throne, the King of the day of judgment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They are pompous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant. If the language of the Alcoran, as the Mahometans pretend, is indeed the language of God, the thoughts are but too evidently the thoughts of men. The reverſe of this is the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Bible. When God ſpeaks to men, 'tis reaſonable to think that he addreſſes them in their own language. In the Bible you will find nothing inflated, nothing affected in the ſtyle. The words are human, but the ſentiments are divine. Accordingly there is perhaps no book in the world, as hath been often juſtly obſerved, which ſuffers leſs by a literal tranſlation into any other language.</note>."</p>

Was it that he had too much honeſty to concert and carry on ſo groſs an artifice? Thoſe who belive him to have been an impoſtor in pretending a divine miſſion, will hardly ſuſpect him of ſuch delicacy in the methods he would take to accompliſh his aim. But in fact there is no colour of reaſon for ſuch a ſuggeſtion. There was no prodigy, no miraculous interpoſition, which he heſitated to give out, however extravagant when he ſaw it would contribute to his ends. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies of which they had no other evidence but his own allegation, he knew his adverſaries might <hi>deny,</hi> but could not <hi>diſprove.</hi> His ſcruples therefore, we may well conclude, proceeded not from <hi>probity,</hi> but from <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi> and were ſolely againſt ſuch miracles, as muſt be ſubjected to the ſcrutiny of other people's ſenſes. Was it that miracle-working had before that time become ſo ſtale a device, that inſtead of gaining him the admiration of his countrymen, it would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him to their laughter and contempt? The moſt curſory peruſal of the Alcoran, will, to every man of ſenſe, afford an unanſwerable confutation of this hypotheſis.
<note n="*" place="bottom">It is obſervable, that Mahomet was very much haraſſed by the demands and reaſonings of his oppoſers with regard to mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.

The following are ſome of the reaſons, with which he endcavours to ſatisfy the people on this head. 1ſt, The <hi>ſovereignty</hi> of God, who is not to be called to account for what he gives or with-holds. 2d, The <hi>uſefulneſs</hi> of miracles, becauſe every man is foreordained either to believe, or to remain in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief; and this decree no miracles could alter. 3d. The <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced inefficacy</hi> of miracles in former times. 4th, The <hi>mercy</hi> of God, who had denied them this evidence, becauſe the ſin of their incredulity, in caſe he had granted it, would have been ſo hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, that he could not have reſpited or tolerated them any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. 5th, The <hi>abuſe</hi> to which miracles would have been expoſed from the infidels, who would have either charged them with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture, or imputed them to magic. See the chapters—of cattle, —of thunder,—of All Hejir,—of the night-journey,—of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,—of the prophets.</note> Laſtly, was it that he lived in an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened

The too timid prophet would doubtleſs have remonſtrated againſt this ſpirited counſel, inſiſting, that it was one thing to ſatisfy <hi>friends,</hi> and another thing to ſilence or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert <hi>enemies;</hi> that it was one thing to impoſe on mens <hi>intellects,</hi> and another thing to deceive their <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:</hi> that tho' an attempt of the laſt kind ſhould ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with ſome, yet if the fraud were detected by any, and he might expect that his adverſaries would exert themſelves in order to detect it, the whole my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of craft would be divulged, his friends would become ſuſpicious, and the ſpectators of ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended miracles would become daily more prying and critical; that the conſequences would infallibly prove fatal to the whole deſign; and that therefore ſuch a cheat was on no account whatever to be riſked. To this methinks I hear the other replying with ſome earneſtneſs, <q>Make but the trial, and you will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly find, that what judgment, nay and what ſenſes your auditors have, they will renounce by principle in thoſe ſublime and myſterious ſubjects; they will imagine they ſee and hear what has no reality, nay whatever you ſhall deſire that they ſhould ſee and hear. Their credulity (forgive a freedom which my zeal inſpires) will increaſe your impudence, and your impudence will overpower their credulity. The ſmalleſt ſpark may here kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle into the greateſt flame; becauſe the materials are always prepared for it. The <hi>avidum genus auricu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larum</hi>

One perhaps (if I might be indulged in a conjecture) whoſe notions are founded in metaphyſical refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or whoſe reſolutions are influenced by ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical declamation, will incline to the opinion of the latter. One whoſe ſentiments are the reſult of a practical knowledge of mankind, will probably ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe to the judgment of the former, and will allow, that in this inſtance the CAPTAIN-GENERAL and PROPHET of <hi>Iſlamiſm</hi> acted the more prudent part.</p>
               <p>Shall we then ſay, that it was a more <hi>obſcure</hi> thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre on which JESUS CHRIST appeared?

It may indeed be affirmed with truth, that the religion of the wild Arabs was more repugnant to the doctrine of Mahomet, than the religious dogmas of the Jews were to thoſe of Jeſus. But we ſhall err egregiouſly, if we conclude thence, that to this repugnancy the repugnancy of diſpoſition in the profeſſors of theſe religions muſt be proportionate. 'Tis a fine obſervation of the moſt piercing and comprehenſive genius, which hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in this age.

                  </gap>METANS, let us turn our eyes to the CHRISTIAN world. The only object here, which merits our attention, as coming under the denomination of miracles aſcribed to a new ſyſtem, and as what may be thought to rival in crebibility the miracles of the goſpel, are thoſe ſaid to have been performed in the <hi>primitive church,</hi> after the times of the apoſtles, and after the finiſhing of the ſacred canon. Theſe will probably be aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a new ſyſtem, ſince Chriſtianity, for ſome cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies, was not (as the phraſe is) <hi>eſtabliſhed,</hi> or (to ſpeak more properly) <hi>corrupted</hi> by human authority; and ſince even after ſuch eſtabliſhment, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained long in the empire a conſiderable mixture of idolaters. We have the greater reaſon here to conſider this topic, as it hath of late been the ſubject of very warm diſpute, and as the cauſe of Chriſtianity itſelf (which I conceive is totally diſtinct) ſeems to have been ſtrangely confounded with it. From the manner in which the argument hath been conducted,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:022387_0097_0FB8635842441FB8"/>who is there that would not conclude that both muſt ſtand or fall together? Nothing however can be more groundleſs, nothing more injurious to the religion of Jeſus, than ſuch a concluſion.</p>
               <p>The learned writer who hath given riſe to this controverſy, not only acknowledges, that the falſity of the miracles mentioned by the fathers, is no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the falſity of the miracles recorded in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but that there is even a preſumption in favour of theſe, ariſing from thoſe forgeries, which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to have detected
<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr Middleton's preſatory diſcourſe to his letter from Rome.</note>. The juſtneſs of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark contained in this acknowledgment, will appear more clearly from the following obſervations.</p>
               <p>Let it be obſerved, firſt, that ſuppoſing numbers of people are aſcertained of the truth of ſome mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, whether their conviction ariſe from ſenſe or from teſtimony, it will ſurely be admitted as a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that in all ſuch perſons, the preſumption againſt miracles from uncommonneſs muſt be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diminiſhed, in ſeveral perhaps totally extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Let it be obſerved, ſecondly, that if true miracles have been employed ſucceſsfully in ſupport of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain religious tenets, this ſucceſs will naturally ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt to thoſe, who are zealous of propagating fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite opinions in religion, to recur to the plea of miracles, as the moſt effectual expedient for accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing their end. This they will be encouraged to do on a double account: <hi>firſt,</hi> they know, that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from recent experience, are made to expect ſuch
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:022387_0098_0FB8635C5FD68728"/>a confirmation; <hi>ſecondly,</hi> they know, that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this experience, the incredibility, which is the principal obſtruction to ſuch an undertaking, is in a manner removed: and there is, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, as in ſuch circumſtances there certainly would be, a promptneſs in the generality to receive them.</p>
               <p>Add to theſe, that if we conſult the hiſtory of mankind, or even our own experience, we ſhall be convinced, that hardly hath one wonderful event actually happened in any country, even where there have not been ſuch viſible temptations to forgery, which hath not given riſe to falſe rumours of other events ſimilar, but ſtill more wonderful. Hardly hath any perſon or people atchieved ſome exploits truly extraordinary, to whom common report hath not quickly attributed many others, as extraordinary at leaſt, if not impoſſible. As <hi>fame</hi> may, in this reſpect, be compared to a <hi>multiplying glaſs,</hi> reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble people almoſt always conclude in the ſame way concerning both; we know that there is not a real object correſponding to every appearance exhibited, at the ſame time we know that there muſt be ſome objects to give riſe to the appearances.</p>
               <p>I ſhould therefore only beg of our adverſaries, that, for argument's ſake, they will ſuppoſe that the miracles related in the New Teſtament were really performed; and then, that they will candidly tell us, what, according to their notions of human nature, would, in all likelihood, have been the conſequences. They muſt be very partial to a darling hypotheſis, or little acquainted with the world, who will heſitate to own, that, on this ſuppoſition, 'tis not barely proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

                  </gap> a few endowed with the miraculous power, there would ſoon have ariſen numbers of pretenders; that from ſome miracles well atteſted, occaſion would have been taken to propagate innumerable falſe reports. If ſo, with what colour of juſtice can the detection of many ſpurious reports among the primitive Chriſtians be conſidered as a preſumption againſt thoſe miracles, the reality of which is the moſt plauſible; nay the only plauſible account that can be given of the origin of ſuch reports? The preſumption is too evidently on the oppoſite ſide to need illuſtration.</p>
               <p>'Tis not my intention here to patronize either ſide of the queſtion which the Doctor's <hi>Free inquiry</hi> hath occaſioned. All that concerns my argument is, bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to evince, and this I imagine hath been evinced, that, granting the Doctor's plea to be well founded, there is no preſumption ariſing hence, which tends in the loweſt degree to diſcredit the miracles record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in holy writ; nay, that there is a contrary preſumption. In further confirmation of this truth, let me aſk, Were there ever, in any region of the globe, any ſimilar pretenſions to miraculous powers, before that memorable <hi>era,</hi> the publication of the goſpel? Let me aſk again, Since thoſe pretenſions ceaſed, hath it ever been in the power of the moſt daring enthuſiaſt, to revive them any where in favour of a new ſyſtem? Authentic miracles will, for a time, give a currency to counterfeits; but as the former be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come leſs frequent, the latter become more ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, till at length they are treated with general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and diſappear. The danger then is, leſt
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:022387_0100_0FB8636054D826B0"/>men, ever prone to extremes, become as extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently incredulous, as formerly they were credulous. <hi>Lazineſs,</hi> the true ſource of both, always inclines us to admit or reject in the <hi>groſs,</hi> without entering on the irk ſome taſk of conſidering things in <hi>detail.</hi> In the firſt inſtance, knowing ſome ſuch events to be true, they <hi>admit all without examination;</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, knowing ſome to be falſe, they <hi>reject all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out examination.</hi> A procedure this, which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever excuſable in the unthinking herd, is altogether unworthy a philoſopher.</p>
               <p>But it may be thought, that the claim to miracles in the early ages of the church, continued too long to be ſupported ſolely on the credit of thoſe perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our Lord and his apoſtles. In order to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for this, it ought to be attended to, that in the courſe of ſome centuries, the ſituation of affairs, with regard to religion, was really inverted. Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and even ſuperſtition, and bigotry, and popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which the miracles of Chriſt and his apoſtles had to encounter; came gradually to be on the ſide of thoſe wonders, ſaid to have been performed in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times. If they were potent <hi>enemies,</hi> and ſuch as we have reaſon to believe nothing but the force of truth could vanquiſh; they were alſo potent <hi>allies,</hi> and may well be ſuppoſed able to give a temporary triumph to falſehood, eſpecially when it had few or no enemies to combat. But in diſcourſing on the prodigies ſaid to have been performed in primitive times, I have been inſenſibly carried from the point, to which I propoſed in this ſection to confine myſelf. From inquiring into miracles aſcribed to new ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtems
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:022387_0101_0FB863621DA59D68"/>I have proceeded to thoſe pleaded in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of ſyſtems previouſly eſtabliſhed and generally received.</p>
               <p>LEAVING ſo remote a period, I propoſe, laſtly, to inquire, whether, ſince that time, any hereſiarch whatever, any founder of a new ſect, or publiſher of a new ſyſtem, hath pretended to miraculous pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. If the eſſayiſt had known of any ſuch pretender, he ſurely would have mentioned him. But as he hath not afforded us any light on this ſubject, I ſhall juſt recall to the remembrance of my reader, thoſe perſons who, either as innovators or reformers, have made ſome figure in the church. They were the perſons from whom, if from any, a plea of this kind might naturally have been expected; eſpecially at a time when Europe was either plunged in barbariſm, or but beginning to emerge out of it,</p>
               <p>Was ever then this high prerogative, the power of working miracles, claimed or exerciſed by the founders of the ſects of the Waldenſes and Albigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? Did Wickliff in England pretend to it? Did Huſs or Jerom in Bohemia? To come nearer mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern times, Did Luther in Germany, Zuinglius in Switzerland, Calvin in France, or any other of the reformers, advance this plea? Do ſuch of them as are authors, mention in their writings any miracles they performed, or appeal to them as the evidences of their doctrine? Do contemporary hiſtorians al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that they challenged the ſaith of their auditors, in conſequence of ſuch ſupernatural powers? I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, if they did, that their miracles might be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to a new ſyſtem. For tho' they pretended only
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:022387_0102_0FB86363458A2AC8"/>to re-eſtabliſh the Chriſtian inſtitution, in its native purity, expunging thoſe pernicious interpolations, which a falſe philoſophy had foiſted into the doctrinal part, and Pagan ſuperſtition into the moral and the ritual; yet as the religion they inculcated, greatly differed from the faith and worſhip of the times, it might, in this reſpect, be denominated a new ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem; and would be encountered by all the violence and prejudice, which novelties in religion never fail to excite. Not that the want of real miracles was a preſumption againſt the truth of their doctrine. The God of nature, who is the God of Chriſtians, does nothing in vain. No new revelation was pretended to; conſequently there was no occaſion for ſuch ſupernatural ſupport. They appealed to the revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on formerly beſtowed, and by all parties acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, as to the proper rule in this controverſy: they appealed to the reaſon of mankind as the judge; and the reaſon of mankind was a competent judge of the conformity of their doctrine to this unerring rule.</p>
               <p>But how, upon the author's principles, ſhall we account for this moderation in the reformers? Were they, in his judgment, calm inquirers into truth? Were they diſpaſſionate reaſoners in defence of it? Far otherwiſe. He tells us, <q>They may ſafely be pronounced to have been univerſally inflamed with the higheſt enthuſiaſm
<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. of Great Britain, James I. chap. 1.</note>.</q> And doubtleſs we cannot expect from this hand a more amiable picture of their diſciples. May not we then, in our turn, ſafely pronounce, this writer himſelf being judge, that for a man to imagine he ſees what hath no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, to impoſe in this manner not only on his own
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:022387_0103_0FB86368B0BDFB48"/>underſtanding, but even on his external ſenſes, is a pitch of deluſion higher than the higheſt enthuſiaſm can produce, and is to be imputed only to downright frenzy
<note n="*" place="bottom">Perhaps it will be pleaded that the working of miracles was conſidered by the leaders in the reformation as a Popiſh artifice, and as therefore worthy of being diſcarded with the other abuſes which Popery had introduced. That this was not the light in which miracles were viewed by Luther, who juſtly poſſeſſes the firſt place in the liſt of reformers, is evident from the manner in which he argues againſt Muncer, the apoſtle of the Anabaptiſts. This man, without ordination, had aſſumed the office of a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian paſtor. Againſt this conduct Luther remouſtrates, as being in his judgment, an uſurpation of the ſacred function. "Let him be aſked," ſays he, <q>Who made him teacher of religion? If he anſwers, God; let him prove it by a viſible <hi>miracle:</hi> for 'tis by ſuch ſigns that God declares himſelf, when he gives an extraordinary miſſion.</q> When this argument was afterwards retorted on himſelf by the Romaniſts, who deſired to know how his own vocation, originally limited and dependent, had become not only unlimited, but quite independent of the hierarchy, from which he had received it; his reply was, That the <hi>intrepidity,</hi> with which he had been enabled to brave ſo many dangers, and the <hi>ſucceſs,</hi> with which his enterprſe had been crowned, ought to be regarded as miraculous: And indeed moſt of his followers were of this opinion. But whether this opinion was erroneous, or whether the argument againſt Muncer was concluſive, 'tis not my buſineſs to enquire. Thus much is evident from the ſtory: <hi>firſt,</hi> That this reformer, far from rejecting miracles as a Romiſh trick, acknowledged, that in ſome religious queſtions, they are the only medium of proof; <hi>ſecondly,</hi> That notwithſtanding this, he never attempted, by a ſhow of miracles, to impoſe on the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of his hearers; (if they were deceived in thinking that his ſucceſs and magnanimity were miraculous, 'twas not their ſenſes, but their underſtanding that was deceived); <hi>laſtly,</hi> That the Anabaptiſts themſelves, tho' perhaps the moſt outrageous fanatics that ever exiſted, did not pretend to the power of working mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.—<hi>Sleidan lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Luth.

Since the world began, there hath not appeared a more general propenſion to the wildeſt fanaticiſm, a greater degree of credulity in every claim that was made to the illapſes of the Holy Spirit, or more tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough contempt of all eſtabliſhed modes of worſhip, than appeared in this iſland about the middle of the laſt century. 'Tis aſtoniſhing, that when the minds of men were intoxicated with enthuſiaſm; when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very new pretender to divine illuminations was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurrounded by a crowd of followers, and his moſt incoherent effuſions greedily ſwallowed as the dictates of the Holy Ghoſt; that in ſuch a Babel of ſectaries, none are to be found, who advanced a claim to the power of working miracles; a claim which, in the author's opinion, tho' falſe, is eaſily ſupported, and wonderfully ſucceſsful, eſpecially among enthuſiaſts. Yet to Mr Hume himſelf, who hath written the hiſtory of that period, and who will not be accuſed of neglecting to mark the extravagancies effected by enthuſiaſm, I appeal whether this remark be juſt.</p>
               <p>Will it be alledged as an exception that one or two frantic people among the Quakers, not the leaders of the party, did actually pretend to ſuch a power? Let it be remembered, that this conduct had no other conſequences, but to bring upon the pretenders ſuch a general contempt, as in that fanatical and gloomy age, the moſt unintelligible jargon or glaring nonſenſe would never have been able to produce.</p>
               <p>Will it be urged by the eſſayiſt, that even in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the preſent century, this plea was revived in Britain by the French prophets, a ſet of poor viſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, who, by the barbarity with which they had been treated in their own country, had been wrought up
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:022387_0105_0FB8636B8F057198"/>to madneſs, before they took refuge in this? I muſt beg leave to remind him, that it is manifeſt, from the hiſtory of thoſe delirious and unhappy creatures, that by no part of their conduct did they ſo effectually open the eyes of mankind naturally credulous, diſcredit their own inſpirations, and ruin their cauſe, as by this, not leſs fooliſh than preſumptuous pretence. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly they are perhaps the only ſect, which hath ſprung up ſo lately, made ſo great a buſtle for a while, and which is nevertheleſs at this day totally extinct. It deſerves alſo to be remarked concerning this people, that though they were mad enough to imagine that they could reſtore a dead man to life; nay tho' they proceeded ſo far, as to determine and announce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand the day and the hour of his reſurrection; yet none of them were ſo diſtracted, as to imagine, that they had ſeen him riſe; not one of them afterwards pretended, that their prediction had been fulfilled. Thus even a frenzy, which had quite diſordered their intellects, could not in this inſtance overpower their ſenſes.</p>
               <p>UPON the whole, therefore, till ſome contrary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is produced, I may warrantably conclude,— that the religion of the BIBLE is the only religion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, which claims to have been recommended by the evidence of <hi>miracles;</hi>—that though in different ages and countries, numberleſs enthuſiaſts have ariſen, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely few have dared to advance this plea;—that wherever any have had the boldneſs to recur to it, it hath proved the bane, and not the ſupport, of their cauſe. Thus it hath been evinced, as was propoſed, that there is no preſumption ariſing from the <hi>hiſtory

                  <q>WHY is a miracle regarded as evidence of a religious doctrine?</q> Or, <q>What connection is there between an act of power admitted to be ſupernatural, and the truth of a propoſition pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by the perſon who exerts that power?</q> Theſe are queſtions, which ſome of our infidels have exulted in as unanſwerable: and they are queſtions, which 'tis proper to examine a little; not ſo much for their own ſake, as becauſe a ſatisfactory anſwer to them may throw light on the ſubject of this ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>A man, I ſuppoſe, of an unblemiſhed character, advanceth doctrines in religion, unknown before, but not in themſelves apparently impious or abſurd. We interrogate him about the manner wherein he attained the knowledge of thoſe doctrines. He affirms, That by no proceſs of reaſoning, nor in any other natural way, did he diſcover them; but that they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to him by the Spirit of God. It muſt be own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there is a very ſtrong preſumption againſt the truth of what he ſays; and 'tis of conſequence to inquire, whence that preſumption ariſeth. It is not primarily from any doubt of the man's integrity. If the fact he
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:022387_0107_0FB86372A015E9B8"/>related, were of an ordinary nature, the reputation he has hitherto maintained would ſecure him from being ſuſpected of an intended deceit. It is not from any abſurdity or immoral tendency we perceive in the doctrine itſelf. It ariſeth principally, if not ſolely from theſe two circumſtances, the extreme uncommon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſuch a revelation, and the great facility with which people of ſtrong fancy, may in this particular impoſe upon themſelves. The man, I ſuppoſed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints us further, that God, when he communicated to him the truths he publiſhes, communicated alſo the power of working miracles; ſuch as, of giving ſight to the blind, and hearing to the deaf, of raiſing the dead, and making whole the maimed. 'Tis evident, that we have preciſely the ſame preſumption againſt his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing endued with ſuch a power, as againſt his having obtained ſuch a revelation. Two things are aſſerted: there is one preſumption, and but one, againſt them; and it equally effects them both. Whatever proves either aſſertion, removes the only preſumption which hinders our belief of the other. The man, I ſuppoſe, laſtly, performs the miracles before us, which he ſaid he was commiſſioned to perform. We can no longer doubt of a ſupernatural communication. We have now all the evidence which the integrity of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon could give us, as to an ordinary event atteſted by him, that the doctrine he delivers as from God, is from God, and therefore true.</p>
               <p>Nay, we have more evidence than for any common fact, vouched by a perſon of undoubted probity. As God is both almighty and all-wiſe, if he hath beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on any ſo uncommon a privilege, 'tis highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that it is beſtowed for promoting ſome end un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commonly
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:022387_0108_0FB86373C6F11D68"/>important. And what more important end than to reveal to men that which may be condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive to their preſent and eternal happineſs? It may be ſaid, That, at moſt, it can only prove the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of ſome power ſuperior to human: the being who interpoſeth is perhaps a bad being, and intends to deceive us. This it may be allowed, is <hi>poſſible;</hi> but the other is <hi>probable.</hi> For, <hi>firſt,</hi> From the light of nature, we have no poſitive evidence of the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſuch intermediate beings, good or bad. Their exiſtence is therefore only poſſible. Of the exiſtence and perfections of God, we have the higheſt moral aſſurance. <hi>Secondly,</hi> If there were ſuch beings, that raiſing the dead, and giving ſight to the blind, ſhould come within the verge of their power, is alſo but poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; that they are within the ſphere of omnipotence is certain. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whatever ſeems to imply a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of any of the eſtabliſhed laws of nature, we may preſume, with great appearance of reaſon, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the author of nature, either <hi>immediately,</hi> or, which amounts, to the ſame thing <hi>mediately:</hi> that is, by the intervention of ſome agent impowered by him. To all theſe there will alſo accrue preſumptions, not only, as was hinted already, from the character of the preacher, but from the apparent tendency of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and from the effect it produceth on thoſe who receive it. And now the connection between the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle and the doctrine is obvious. The miracle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves the improbability of a ſupernatural communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of which it is in fact an irrefragable evidence. This improbability, which was the only obſtacle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing removed, the doctrine hath, at leaſt, all the evidence
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:022387_0109_0FB86375475FDCF8"/>of a common fact, atteſted by a man of known virtue and good ſenſe.</p>
               <p>In order to illuſtrate this further, I ſhall recur to the inſtance I have already had occaſion to conſider, of the Dutchman and the King of Siam. I ſhall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that, beſides the account given by the former of the freezing of water in Holland, he had informed the prince of the aſtoniſhing effects produced by gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, with which the latter had been entirely unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted. Both accounts appear to him alike incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or, if you pleaſe, abſolutely impoſſible. Some time afterwards, the Dutchman gets imported into the kingdom a ſufficient quantity of gunpowder, with the neceſſary artillery. He informs the monarch of this acquiſition; who having permitted him to make experiments on ſome of his cattle and buildings, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieves, with inexpreſſible amazement, that all the European had told him, of the celerity and violence with which this deſtructive powder operates, is ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conformable to truth. I aſk any conſiderate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Would not this be enough to reſtore the ſtranger to the Indian's good opinion, which, I ſuppoſe, his former experienced honeſty had entitled him to? Would it not remove the incredibility of the account he had given of the freezing of water in northern coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries? Yet, if abſtractly conſidered, what connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is there between the effects of gunpowder and the effects of cold? But the preſumption ariſing from miracles, in favour of the doctrine publiſhed by the performer, as divinely inſpired, muſt be incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably ſtronger; ſince, from what hath been ſaid, it appears to have ſeveral peculiar circumſtances, which
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:022387_0110_0FB8637A11C178A0"/>add weight to it. 'Tis evident, then, that miracles are a proper proof, and perhaps the only proper proof, of a revelation from Heaven. But 'tis alſo evident, that miracles may be wrought for other purpoſes, and may not be intended as proofs of any doctrine what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
               <p>THUS much being premiſed, I ſhall examine ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very curious argument of the eſſayiſt: <q>There is no teſtimony,</q> ſays he, <q>for any prodigy, that is not oppoſed by an infinite number of witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; ſo that not only the miracle deſtroys the credit of the teſtimony, but even the teſtimony deſtroys itſelf
<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 190, &amp;c.</note>.</q> In order to illuſtrate this ſtrange poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he obſerves, that, <q>in matters of religion, whatever is different is contrary; and that it is impoſſible the religions of ancient Rome, of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key, of Siam, and of China, ſhould all of them be eſtabliſhed on any ſolid foundation. Every mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle therefore pretended to have been wrought in any of theſe religions, (and all of them abound in miracles) as its direct ſcope is to eſtabliſh the particular ſyſtem to which it is attributed, ſo it has the ſame force, tho' more indirectly, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw every other ſyſtem. In deſtroying a rival ſyſtem, it likewiſe deſtroys the credit of thoſe miracles, on which that ſyſtem was eſtabliſhed; ſo that all the prodigies of different religions are to be regarded as contrary facts, and the evidences of theſe prodigies, whether weak or ſtrong, as oppoſite to each other.</q> Never did an author
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:022387_0111_0FB8637C1CF14958"/>more artfully avail himſelf of indefinite expreſſions. With what admirable ſleght does he vary his phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſo as to make the inadvertent reader look upon them as ſynonymous, when in fact their ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are totally diſtinct? Thus what, by a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary idiom, is called at firſt, <q>miracles wrought in a religion,</q> we are next to regard, as 'miracles attributed to a particular ſyſtem,' and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as <q>miracles, the direct ſcope of which is to eſtabliſh that ſyſtem.</q> Every body, I will venture to ſay, in beginning to read the ſentence, if he forms any notion of what the author means by a 'miracle wrought in a religion,' underſtands it barely as a <q>miracle wrought among thoſe who profeſs a particular religion,</q> the words appearing to be uſed in the ſame latitude, as when we call the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional tales current among the Jews, tho' they ſhould have no relation to religion, Jewiſh tales; and thoſe in like manner Mahometan or Pagan tales, which are current among Mahometans or Pagans. Such a miracle, the reader, ere he is aware, is brought to conſider as a miracle attributed to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſyſtem; nay further, as a <q>miracle, the direct ſcope of which is to eſtabliſh that ſyſtem.</q> Yet nothing can be conceived more different than the meaning of theſe expreſſions, which are here jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together as equivalent.</p>
               <p>'Tis plain, that all the miracles of which there is any record, come under the firſt denomination. They are all ſuppoſed to have been wrought before men, or among men; and wherever there are men, there is religion of ſome kind or other. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:022387_0112_0FB8637D8866E8D0"/>too all may, in a very <hi>improper</hi> ſenſe, be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to a religious ſyſtem. They all imply an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption of the ordinary courſe of nature. Such an interruption, wherever it is obſerved, will be aſcribed to the agency of thoſe divinities that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored by the obſervers, and ſo may be ſaid to be attributed by them to their own ſyſtem. But where are the miracles (thoſe of holy writ excepted) of which you can ſay with propriety, it is their direct ſcope to eſtabliſh a particular ſyſtem? Muſt we not then be ſtrangely blinded by the charms of a few am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous terms, if we are made to confound things ſo widely different? Yet this confuſion is the very baſis, on which the author founds his reaſoning, and rears this tremendous doctrine; That <q>a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Mahomet, or any of his ſucceſſors,</q> and, by parity of reaſon, a miracle of Chriſt, or any of his apoſtles, <q>is refuted (as if it had been mentioned, and had in expreſs terms, been contradicted) by the teſtimony of Titus Livius, Plutarch, Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, and of all the authors, Chineſe, Grecian, and Roman Catholic, who have related any mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in their particular religions.</q> Here all the miracles, that have been related by men of different religions, are blended, as coming under the common denomination of miracles, the direct ſcope of which was to eſtabliſh thoſe particular religious ſyſtems; an inſinuation, in which there is not even the ſhadow of truth.</p>
               <p>That the reader may be ſatisfied on this point, I muſt beg his attention to the following obſervations concerning the miracles of profane hiſtory. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Many facts are related as miraculous, where we may
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:022387_0113_0FB863820D19F160"/>admit the fact, without acknowledging the miracle. Inſtances of this kind we have in relations concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing comets, eclipſes, meteors, earthquakes, and ſuchlike. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The miracles may be admitted as genuine, and the manner in which hiſtorians ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for them, rejected as abſurd. The one is a matter of teſtimony, the other of conjecture. In this a man is influenced by education, by prejudices, by received opinions. In every country, as was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved already, men will recur to the theology of the place, for the ſolution of every phenomenon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed miraculous. But, that it was the ſcope of the miracle to ſupport the theology, is one thing; and that fanciful men thought they diſcovered in the theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy the cauſes of the miracle, is another. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Lyſtra accounted, from the principles of their own religion, for the miracle performed in their city by Paul and Barnabas
<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xiv. 8. &amp;c</note>. Was it therefore the ſcope of that miracle to ſupport the Lycaonian religion? <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Many miracles are recorded, as produced directly by Heaven without the miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men: by what conſtruction are theſe diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to be proofs of a particular ſyſtem? Yet theſe alſo, wherever they happen, will be accounted for by the natives of the country, from the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of their own ſuperſtition. Had any of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan citizens eſcaped the ruin in which Sodom was miraculouſly involved, they would doubtleſs have ſought for the cauſe of this deſtruction in the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mode of polytheiſm, and would probably have imputed it to the vengeance of ſome of their deities, incurred by the neglect of ſome frivolous ceremony.
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:022387_0114_0FB863864BEE7950"/>Would it therefore have been the ſcope of the miracle to confirm this nonſenſe? <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Even miracles ſaid to have been performed by a man, are no eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the truth of that man's opinions; ſuch, I mean, as he pretends not to have received by revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but by the excerciſe of reaſon, by education, or by information from other men; no more than a man's being endowed with bodily ſtrenth greater than ordinary, would prove him to be ſuperior to others in his mental ſaculties. I conclude with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, that if inſtances ſhall be produced, of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles wrought by men of probity, in proof of doctrines which they affirm to have been revealed to them from Heaven, and which are repugnant to the doctrine of the Bible, then I ſhall think it equitable to admit, that religious miracles contradict one another. Then will reaſonable people be reduced to the dilemma, either of diſproving the allegations on one ſide, or of acknowledging that miracles can be no evidence of revelation. No attempt however hath as yet been made by any writer to produce an inſtance of this kind.</p>
               <p>'But will nothing leſs ſatisfy?' replies the author. <q>Will not the predictions of augurs and oracles, and the intimations ſaid to have been given by the gods or ſaints in dreams and viſions, of things not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe knowable by thoſe to whom they were thus intimated; will not theſe, and ſuchlike prodigies, ſerve in ſome degree as evidence?</q> As evidence of what? Shall we ſay of any religious principles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed at the ſame time by revelation? No, 'tis not even pretended, that there were any ſuch principles
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:022387_0115_0FB8638838A04EB0"/>ſo conveyed: but as evidence of principles which had been long before entertained, and which were originally imbibed from education, and from education only. That the evidence here, ſuppoſing the truth of the facts, is at beſt but very indirect, and by no means on the ſame footing with that of the miracles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the goſpel, might be eaſily evinced, if there were occaſion. But there is in reality no occaſion, ſince there is no ſuch evidence of the facts as can juſtly intitle them to our notice. Let it be remembered, that, in the fourth ſection of the firſt part, it was ſhown, that there is the greateſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity, in reſpect of evidence, betwixt miracles per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in proof of a religion <hi>to be</hi> eſtabliſhed, and in <hi>contradiction</hi> to opinions generally received; and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles performed, on the contrary, in ſupport of a religion <hi>already</hi> eſtabliſhed, and in <hi>confirmation</hi> of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions generally received; that, in the former caſe, there is the ſtrongeſt perſumption <hi>for</hi> the miracles, in the latter <hi>againſt</hi> them. Let it alſo be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, that in the preceding ſection it was ſhown, that the religion of the Bible is the only religion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, which claims to have been uſhered into the world by miracles; that this prerogative neither the Pagan religion, the Mahometan, nor the Roman-Catholic, can, with any appearance of reaſon, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate; and that, by conſequence, there is one of the ſtrongeſt preſumptions poſſible <hi>for</hi> the miracles of the goſpel, which is not only wanting in the miracles of other religions, but which is contraſted by the ſtrongeſt preſumption poſſible <hi>againſt</hi> theſe miracles. And tho' this preſumption ſhould not, in all caſes,
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:022387_0116_0FB8638A076FF9F8"/>be accounted abſolutely inſuperable, we muſt at leaſt ſay, it gives an immenſe ſuperiority to the proofs of Chriſtianity. 'Twere an endleſs and a fruitleſs taſk to canvaſs particularly the evidence of all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended miracles either of Paganiſm or Popery, (for on this head Mahometiſm is much more modeſt) but as the author hath ſelected ſome, which he conſiders as the beſt atteſted, of both religions, theſe ſhall be examined ſeverally in the two ſubſequent ſections. From this examination a tolerable judgment may be formed concerning the pretenſions of theſe two ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of ſuperſtition.</p>
               <p>But from what hath been ſaid, it is evident, that the contrariety which the author pretends to have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in the miracles ſaid to have been wrought, as he expreſſeth it, in different religions, vaniſhes entirely on a cloſe inſpection. He is even ſenſible of this himſelf; and, as is cuſtomary with orators, the more inconcluſive his reaſons are, ſo much the more poſitive are his aſſertions. "This argument," ſays he, "may appear over ſubtile and refined;" indeed ſo ſubtile and refined, that it is inviſible altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <q>
                     <hi>but</hi>— is not <hi>in reality</hi> different from the reaſoning of a judge, who ſuppoſes that the credit of two witneſſes maintaining a crime againſt any one, is deſtroyed by the teſtimony of two others, who affirm him to have been two hundred leagues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, at the ſame inſtant when the crime is ſaid to have been committed.</q> After the particle <hi>but,</hi> with which this clauſe begins, the reader naturally expects ſuch an explication of the argument, as will convince him, that tho' <hi>ſubtile</hi> and <hi>refined,</hi> it hath
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:022387_0117_0FB8638B063BE2E0"/>
                  <hi>ſolidity</hi> and <hi>ſtrength.</hi> Inſtead of this, he hath only the author's <hi>word</hi> warranting it to be good to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents: "But <hi>is not in reality</hi> different," <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogy between his <hi>example</hi> and his <hi>argument</hi> ſeems to be but very diſtant; I ſhall therefore, without any comment, leave it with the reader as I find it.</p>
               <p>THUS it appears, that, for aught the author hath as yet proved, no miracles recorded by hiſtorians of other religions are ſubverſive of the evidence ariſing from the miracles wrought in proof of Chriſtianity, or can juſtly be conſidered as contrary teſtimony.</p>

               <p>Thus the eſſayiſt hath laid us under the diſagreeable neceſſity of inferring, that he is either very raſh in his
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:022387_0121_0FB86392D1C8D758"/>general aſſertions, or uſeth very great amplification in his particular narrations. Perhaps in both infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, we ſhall find, upon inquiry, that there is ſome truth. In his <hi>Hiſtory of Great Britain,</hi> he gives us notice
<note n="*" place="bottom">James I. chap. 2.</note>, that he addreſſed himſelf <q>to a more diſtant poſterity, than will ever be reached by any local temporary theology.</q> Why did he not likewiſe, in writing the <hi>Eſſays,</hi> entertain this grand idea? It would have been of uſe to him. It would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented his falling into thoſe inconſiſtencies, which his too great attention and antipathy to what he calls a <hi>localtemporary theology,</hi> only could occaſion; and which, when that theology, according to his hypotheſis, ſhall be extinct, and when all our religious controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies ſhall be forgotten, muſt appear unaccountable and ridiculous. People will not then have the means of diſcovering, what is ſo obvious to us his contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries, that he only aſſumes the appearance of an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate for ſome miracles, which are diſbelieved by the generality of Proteſtants, his countrymen, in order, by the compariſon, to vilify the miracles of ſacred writ, which are acknowledged by them.</p>
               <p>BUT to deſcend to particulars, I ſhall begin with conſidering thoſe miracles, for which the author is indebted to the ancient Pagans. Firſt, in order to convince us, how eaſy a matter it is for cunning and impudence to impoſe by falſe miracles on the credulity of barbarians, he introduces the ſtory of Alexander of
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:022387_0122_0FB8639410FC4440"/>Pontus
<note n="†" place="bottom">p 188. &amp;c.</note>. The juſtneſs of the account he gives of this impoſtor from Lucian, I ſhall not diſpute. But that it may appear, how little the Chriſtian religion is affected by this relation, notwithſtanding ſome inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations he hath intermixt with it, I ſhall make the following remarks.</p>
               <p>It is of importance to know, what was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of this once ſo famous, tho' now forgotten Paphlagonian. Was he a publiſher of ſtrange gods? No
<note n="*" place="bottom">The learned and judicious author of the <hi>Obſervations on the converſion and apoſtleſhip of Saint Paal,</hi> hath inad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>antly ſaid of Alexander, that he introduced a <hi>new god</hi> into Pontus. The truth is, he only exhibited a reproduction of <hi>Eſculapius,</hi> a well known deity in thoſe parts, to whom he gave indeed the <hi>new name</hi> GLY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CON. In this there was nothing unſuitable to the genius of the mythology. Accordingly, we do not find, that either the prieſts, or the people, were in the leaſt alarmed for the religion of the country, or charged Alexander as an <hi>innovator</hi> in religious matters. On the contrary, the greateſt enemies he had to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, were not the religioniſts, but the latitudinarians.</note>. Was he the founder of a new ſyſtem in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? No. What was he then? He was no other than a profeſſed fortune-teller. What were the arts by which he carried on this gainful trade? The eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayiſt juſtly remarks, that <q>it was a wiſe policy in him to lay the firſt ſcene of his impoſtures in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where the people were extremely ignorant and ſtupid, and ready to ſwallow the groſſeſt deluſion.</q> For, <q>had Alexander fixed his reſidence at Athens, the philoſophers of that renowned mart of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, had immediately ſpread thro' the whole Roman empire their ſenſe of the matter; which, being
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:022387_0123_0FB8639589A1C648"/>ſupported by ſo great authority, and diſplayed by all the force of reaſon and eloquence, had entirely opened the eyes of mankind.</q> I ſhall beg leave to remark another inſtance of good policy in him. He attemped not to gain the veneration of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude by oppoſing, but by adopting their religious prejudices. His whole plan of deceit was founded in the eſtabliſhed ſuperſtition. The author himſelf will acknowledge, it would have been extreme folly in him to have acted otherwiſe: and all the world, I believe, will agree in thinking, that, in that caſe, he could not have had the ſmalleſt probability of ſucceſs. What were the miracles he wrought? I know of none, unleſs we will dignify with that name, ſome feats of legerdemain, performed moſtly by can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle light; which, in many parts of Europe, we may daily ſee equalled, nay far exceeded, by thoſe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern juglers. Add to theſe ſome oracles he pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, concerning which, if we may form a judgment from the account and ſpecimen given us by Lucian, we ſhould conclude, that, like other Heathen ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, they were generally unintelligible, equivocal, or falſe. Before whom did he exhibit his wonders? Before none, if he could help it, that were not tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough believers in the popular ſyſtem. His noctur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal myſteries were always introduced with an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAUNT to <hi>Atheiſts, Chriſtians,</hi> and <hi>Epicurians:</hi> and indeed it was dangerous for any ſuch to be preſent at them. Mr Hume ſays, that, <q>from his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Paphlagonians, he was enabled to proceed to the inliſting of votaries among the Grecian philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers.</q> On what authority he advances this, I have not been able to diſcover. He adds, <q>and
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:022387_0124_0FB86397054B29E0"/>men of the moſt eminent rank and diſtinction in Rome.</q> Lucian mentions one man of rank, Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilianus, among the votaries of the prophet; an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man he calls him, but at the ſame time the weakeſt, the moſt ſuperſtitions that ever lived. As to the military expedition, which one would imagine from Mr Hume's expreſſion, the Emperor had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved on, in conſequence of the encouragement which the deluſive prophecies of this impoſtor gave him, we find, on the contrary, it was undertaken, before thoſe prophecies were uttered. But further, Did Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der riſk any thing in aſſuming the character of the <hi>interpreter</hi> of ESCULAPIUS? Did he loſe, or did he ſuffer any thing in defence of it? Quite the reverſe. He enriched himſelf by this moſt ingenious occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toin. I ſhall ſay nothing of the picture which Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an gives of his morals, of the many artifices which he uſed, or of the atrocious crimes which he perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated. It muſt be owned, that the principal ſcope for calumny and detraction is what concerns the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life and moral character. Lucian was an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and, by his own account, had received the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt provocation. But I avoid every thing, on this topic, that can admit a queſtion.</p>
               <p>Where, I would gladly know, lies the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance between this impoſtor and the firſt publiſhers of the goſpel? Every one, on the moſt ſuperficial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, may diſcover, that, in all the material circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, they are perfect contraſts. There appears not therefore to be great danger in the poignant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark with which the author concludes this relation: <q>Tho' <hi>much to be wiſhed,</hi> it does not always hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, that every <hi>Alexander</hi> meets with a <hi>Lucian</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:022387_0125_0FB8639C8F6A0B80"/>to expoſe and detect his impoſtures.</q> Leſt the full import of this emphatical clauſe ſhould not be apprehended, the author hath been ſtill more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit in the note: <q>It may here perhaps be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that I proceed raſhly, and form my no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Alexander, merely from the account gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of him by Lucian, a profeſſed enemy. <hi>It were indeed to be wiſhed,</hi> that ſome of the accounts publiſhed by his followers and accomplices had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained. The oppoſition and contraſt betwixt the character and conduct of the ſame man, as drawn by a friend or an enemy, is as ſtrong, even in common life, much more in theſe religious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as that betwixt any two men in the world, betwixt Alexander and St Paul for inſtance.</q> Who can forbear to lament the uncommon diſtreſs of an author, obliged every moment to recur to unavail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wiſhes? Mr Hume, however, in this calamitous ſituation, ſolaceth himſelf, as well as he can, by ſuppoſing what he cannot aſſert. He ſuppoſeth what would have been the caſe, if his wiſhes could have been gratified; and artfully inſinuates, in this manner to his readers; that if we had the character and conduct of the apoſtle, delineated by as able an enemy as Lucian, we ſhould find the portrait as ugly as that of Alexander.</p>
               <p>Let us then for once ſuppoſe, what the author ſo ardently wiſhes, that ſuch an enemy had undertaken the hiſtory of Paul of Tarſus. I can eaſily conceive what a different repreſentation we ſhould, in that caſe, have had, of the mental endowments and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſpoſition, as well as of the inducements and views of this Chriſtian miſſionary. I can conceive
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:022387_0126_0FB8639FAA9EDBB0"/>alſo, that both his actions and diſcourſes might have been ſtrangely disfigured. But if the biographer had maintained any regard, I ſay not, to truth, but to probability; there are ſome things, we may be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely certain, he would never have advanced. He would not ſurely have ſaid of Paul, that he was by pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ſion a cunning man, or <hi>conjurer;</hi> one who, for a little money, either told people their fortunes, or taught them how to recover ſtolen goods. He would not, I ſuppoſe, have pretended, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the apoſtle went, he flattered the ſuperſtition of the populace, in order to gain them, and founded all his pretenſions on the popular ſyſtem. He would not have alledged, that Paul <hi>inriched</hi> himſelf, or that he could ever have the proſpect of inriching himſelf, by his vocation; nay, or that he riſked nothing, or ſuffered nothing, by it. He could not have ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, that he <hi>declined</hi> the audience or ſcrutiny of men, whoſe opinions in religion differed from thoſe on which his miſſion was founded. He durſt not have imputed to him the <hi>wiſe policy</hi> of laying the ſcene of his impoſtures, only where ignorance, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariſm, and ſtupidity prevailed: as it is unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that our apoſtle traverſed great part, not only of Aſia Minor, but of Macedonia, and Achaia; fixed his reſidence eighteen months at Corinth, a city not leſs celebrated for the polite arts, than for its popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſneſs and riches; preached publicly at Athens before the Stoics and the Epicureans, and even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Areopagus, the moſt venerable judicature in Greece; not afraid of what the philoſophers of that renowned mart of learning, might ſpread through
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:022387_0127_0FB863A0CA78B9A0"/>the whole Roman empire, concerning him and his doctrine; nay, and laſtly preached at Rome itſelf, the miſtreſs and metropolis of the world.</p>
               <p>The reader will obſerve, that, in this compariſon, I have ſhunned every thing that is of a private, and therefore of a dubious nature. The whole is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on ſuch actions and events as were notorious; which 'tis not in the power of contemporary hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians to falſiſy; ſuch with regard to Alexander, as a <hi>votary</hi> could not have diſſembled; ſuch with regard to Paul, as an <hi>enemy</hi> durſt not have denied. We are truly indebted to the eſſayiſt, who intending to exhibit a <hi>rival</hi> to the apoſtle, hath produced a character which, we find on making the compariſon, ſerves only for a foil. Truth never ſhines with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter luſtre, than when confronted with falſehood. The evidence of our religion, how ſtrong ſoever, appears not ſo irreſiſtibly, conſidered by itſelf, as when by compariſon we perceive, that none of thoſe artifices and circumſtances attended its propagation, which the whole courſe of experience ſhows to be neceſſary to render impoſture ſucceſsful.</p>
               <p>THE next topic on which the ingenious author hath beſtowed ſome flouriſhes, is the miracle <q>which Tacitus reports of Veſpaſian, who cured a blind man in Alexandria, by means of his ſpittle, and a lame man by the mere touch of his foot, in obedience to a viſion of the god Serapis, who had enjoined them to have recourſe to the emperor, for theſe miraculous and extraordinary cures

<pb n="119" facs="unknown:022387_0128_0FB863A252AEAB48"/>
                  <q>one of the beſt atteſted miracles in all profane hiſtory.</q> If ſo, it will the better ſerve for a ſam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of what may be expected from that quarter. "Every circumſtance," he tells us, <q>ſeems to add weight to the teſtimony, and might be diſplayed at large, with all the force of argument and eloquence, if any one were now concerned to enforce the evidence of that exploded and idolatrous ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition.</q> For my part, were I concerned to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the evidence of that exploded and idolatrous ſuperſtition, I ſhould not wiſh the ſtory were in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hands than in the author's. He is by no means deficient in eloquence; and if ſometimes there appear a deficiency in argument, that is not imputable to him, but to the ſubject, which cannot furniſh him with any better: and tho' I do not ſuſpect him to be in the leaſt concerned to re-eſtabliſh Paganiſm, yet 'tis well known, that hatred to his adverſary may as ſtrongly animate an advocate to exert himſelf, as affection to his client.</p>
               <p>But to proceed to the ſtory: Firſt, the author pleads <q>the gravity, ſolidity, age, and probity of ſo great an emperor, who, thro' the whole courſe of his life, converſed in a familiar way with his friends and courtiers, and never affected thoſe extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry airs of divinity aſſumed by Alexander and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius.</q> To this character, the juſtneſs of which I intend not to controvert, I ſhall beg leave to add, what is equally indubitable, and much to the purpoſe, that no emperor ſhowed a ſtronger inclination to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborate his title by a ſanction of the gods, than the prince of whom he is ſpeaking. This, doubtleſs,
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:022387_0129_0FB863A46F894BD8"/>he thought the more neceſſary in his caſe, as he was of an obſcure family, and nowiſe related to any of his predeceſſors. How fond he was of p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Doth Tacitus pretend that he was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a witneſs of the miracle? No. Doth he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it as a thing which he believes? No. In ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe I a knowledge, that the reputation of the <hi>relater</hi> for candour and penetration, muſt have added weight to the relation, whether conſidered as his <hi>teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony,</hi> or barely as his <hi>opinion.</hi> But is it fair to plead the veracity of the writer in proof of every po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular rumour mentioned by him? His veracity is only concerned to ſatisfy us, that it was actually report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as he r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ectly, whether he believes the miracle or not; but by his manner of telling it, he plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuates, that he thought it ridiculous. In introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:022387_0130_0FB863A548992048"/>it, he intimates the utility of ſuch reports to the Emperor's cauſe. "By which," ſays he, <q>the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of heaven, and the appointment of the gods, might be urged in ſupport of his title

But if this be allowed to take the place of argument, I ſee no reaſon why I may not avail myſelf of the privilege of ſuppoſing, as well as the author.

Was it then matter of ſurpriſe, that a ſtory, which at once ſoothed the ſuperſtition of the populace, and ſavoured their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical ſchemes, ſhould gain ground among them? Can we juſtly wonder, that the wiſer few, who were not deceived ſhould convive at, or even contribute to promote a deceit, which was highly uſeful to the cauſe wherein themſelves were imbarked, and at the ſame time highly grateful to the many? Laſtly, can we be ſurpriſed that any, who, ſo ſeven and twenty years, had, from motives of intereſt, and ambition, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity, propagated a falſchood, ſhould not afterwards be willing to expoſe themſelves as liars?</p>

The author finiſhes the ſtory thus: <q>To which if we add the public nature of the facts related, it will appear, that no evidence can well be ſuppoſed ſtronger for ſo groſs and ſo palpable a falſehood.</q> As to the nature of the facts, we are told by Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus, that when Veſpaſian conſulted the phyſicians, whether ſuch maladies were curable by human art, they declared
<note n="*" place="bottom">Huic non exeſam vim luminis, et redituram, ſi pellerentur obſtantia: illi elapſos in pravum artus, ſi ſalubris vis adhibeatur, poſſe integrari.</note>, that <q>in the one the power of ſight was not extinct, but would return, were the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles removed; that in the other, the joints had ſuffered ſome diſlocation, which by a ſalutary preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure might be redreſſed.</q> From this account we are naturally led to conclude, that the diſorders were not ſo conſpicuous, but that either they might have been feigned, where they were not; or that cures might have been pretended, where none were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. I think it is even a further preſumption of the truth of this concluſion, that Suetonius, the only other Roman hiſtorian who mentions the miracle, (I know not how he hath been overlooked by Mr Hume) differs from Tacitus, in the account he gives of the lameneſs. The one repreſents it as being in the hand, the other, as in the leg

               <p>There are other circumſtances regarding this ſtory on which I might make ſome remarks; but ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear,

               <p>THE firſt of this kind he takes notice of
<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 193. &amp;c.</note>, is a Spaniſh miracle recorded in the memoirs of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>de Retz.</hi> The ſtory, he ſays, is very memorable, and may well deſerve our conſideration. <q>When
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:022387_0134_0FB863ACFB7FB850"/>that intriguing politician fled into Spain, to avoid the perſecution of his enemies, he paſſed thro' Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goſſa the capital of Arragon; where he was ſhown in the cathedral church, a man, who had ſerved twenty years as a door keeper of the church, and was well known to every body in town, that had ever paid their devotions at that cathedral.— He had been for ſo long a time wanting a leg; but recovered that limb, by the rubbing of holy oil upon the ſtump; <hi>and, when the cardinal examined it, he found it to be a true natural leg, like the other.</hi>
                  </q> Would not any perſon imagine, from the laſt words of the ſentence, that the cardinal had ordered the man to put off his ſhoes and ſtockings, that, by touch as well as by ſight, he might be ſatisfied, there was no artifice uſed, but that both his legs conſiſted of genuine fleſh and bone? Yet the truth is, his Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency did not think it worth while to examine any one circumſtance of this wonderful narration, but contented himſelf with reporting it preciſely as it had been told him. His words literally tranſlated are, <q>In that church they ſhowed me a man, whoſe bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs it was to light the lamps, of which they have a prodigious number, telling me, that he had been ſeen ſeven years at the gate, with one leg on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

I have a better opinion both of the candour and of the good ſenſe of Mr Hume, than to imagine, he would have deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly miſrepreſented this ſtory, in order to render it fitter for his purpoſe. I believe the ſource of this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror hath been ſolely the truſting to his memory in the relation which he gave, and not taking the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to conſult the paſſage in the memoirs. This conjecture appears the more probable, as he hath made ſome other alterations, which are nowiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to his deſign; ſuch as, that the man had been ſeen in the church <hi>twenty</hi> years wanting a leg, and that he was a <hi>door-keeper;</hi> whereas the memoir-writer ſays only <hi>ſeven</hi> years, and that he was one <hi>who light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the lamps</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Since finiſhing this tract, I have ſeen an edition of Mr Hume's eſſays, &amp;c. later than that here reſered to. It is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at London 1760. I muſt do the author the juſtice to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that, in this edition, he hath corrected the miſtake, as to the cardinal's examining the man's leg, of which he only "ſays, The cardinal aſſures us, that he ſaw him with two legs." He ſtill calls him a <hi>door-keeper,</hi> and ſays, that he had ſerved <hi>twenty</hi> years in this capacity.</note>.</p>
               <p>"This miracle was vouched," ſays the author, <q>by all the canons of the church; and the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in town were appealed to, for a confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the fact, whom the Cardinal found, by their zealous devotion, to be thorough believers of the miracle.</q> 'Tis true, that the company in town were appealed to, by thoſe eccleſiaſtics; but 'tis alſo true, that <hi>De Retz,</hi> by his own account,
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:022387_0136_0FB863B20CB670B8"/>ſeems not to have aſked any man a queſtion on the ſubject. He acknowledges indeed, that an anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary feſtival, inſtituted in commemoration of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, was celebrated by a vaſt concourſe of people of all ranks.</p>
               <p>"Here," continues the eſſayiſt, <q>the relater was alſo contemporary to the ſuppoſed prodigy, of an incredulous and libertine character, as well as of great genius.</q> But of what weight, in this affair, is either the genius or the incredulity of the relater, ſince, by Mr Hume's confeſſion, he had no faith in the relation? Strange indeed is the uſe which the eſſayiſt makes of this circumſtance!</p>
               <p>"What <hi>adds mightily,</hi>" ſays he, <q>to the force of the evidence, and may double our ſurpriſe on this occaſion, is, that the cardinal himſelf, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the ſtory, ſeems not to give any credit to it.</q> It doth not in the leaſt ſurpriſe me, that the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal gives no credit to this relation; but I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond meaſure ſurpriſed, that Mr Hume ſhould repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent this circumſtance as <hi>adding mightily</hi> to the force of the evidence. Is then a ſtory which is reported by a man of genius, the more credible that he doth not believe it? Or, Is it the more incredible that he doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it? What would the author have ſaid, if the cardinal had told us, that he gave credit to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation? Might he not, in that caſe, have very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently pleaded the great genius, and penetration, and incredulity of the relater, as <hi>adding mightily</hi> to the force of the evidence? On that hypotheſis, he ſurely might, for pretty obvious reaſons. Uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon penetration qualifies a man for detecting fraud;
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:022387_0137_0FB863B386D2B058"/>and it requires evidence greater than ordinary to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount incredulity. The belief therefore of ſuch a perſon as the cardinal, who had not only the means of diſcovering <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n impoſture, as he was contemporary and on the ſpot, but the ability to diſcover it, as he was a man of genius, and not over-credulous; his belief, I ſay, would evidently have been no ſmall preſumption of the truth of the miracle. How his diſbelief can be in like manner a preſumption of its truth, is to me incomprehenſible. Ay but, rejoins the author, <q>as he ſeems not to give any credit to it, he cannot be ſuſpected of any concurrence in the holy fraud.</q> Very well. I am ſatisfied that a man's TESTIMONY is the <hi>more</hi> to be regarded, that he is above being ſuſpected of concurring in <hi>any fraud,</hi> call it holy or unholy. But I want to know why, on the very ſame account, his OPINION is <hi>the leſs</hi> to be regarded? For my part, I find no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in believing every article of the narration for which the cardinal gives his teſtimony: notwithſtanding this, I may be of the ſame opinion with him; that the account given by the dean and canons, which is their teſtimony, not his, was all a fiction. But it is not with the cardinal's <hi>teſtimony</hi> we are here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned: about that there is no diſpute. It is with his <hi>opinion.</hi> Are then a man's ſentiments about a matter of fact, I muſt inſiſt on it, the leſs worthy of regard, either becauſe he is a man of genius, and not at all credulous, or becauſe he cannot be ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of any concurrence in a holy fraud? Are they the more improbable on theſe accounts? The eſſayiſt, when he reflects, will be the laſt man in the world,
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:022387_0138_0FB863B838BCA0B0"/>would aſſiſt in eſtabliſhing a maxim ſo unfavora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, not only to candour, but even to genius and ſcepticiſm: and indeed there are few, if any, that would be greater ſufferers by it than himſelf.</p>
               <p>But leaving this, as one of the unfathomable depths of the eſſay, I proceed to the other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. "The miracle," ſays the author, <q>of ſo ſingular a nature, as could <hi>ſcarce</hi> admit of a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit.</q> He did well at leaſt to uſe the word <hi>ſcarce;</hi> for if every viſitant was as little deſirous of prying into the ſecret, as the cardinal, nothing could be more eaſily counterfeited: <q>And the witneſſes very numerous, and all of them, <hi>in a manner,</hi> ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the fact, to which they gave their teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</q> By the <hi>very numerous witneſſes,</hi> I ſuppoſe he means the whole company in town, who were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to. They were all, <hi>in a manner,</hi> ſpectators of the fact. What preciſe abatement the author intended we ſhould make, from the ſenſe of the word <hi>ſpectators,</hi> on account of the qualifying phraſe, <hi>in a manner,</hi> I ſhall not preſume to determine; but ſhall obſerve, from the memoirs, that it was not ſo much as pretended by the canons, that any of the citizons had ſeen the miracle performed; 'twas only pretended, that they had ſeen the man formerly at the gate of the church, wanting a leg. Nor is it alledged, that any of them was at more pains in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining the matter, either before or after the recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the leg, than the cardinal was. They were therefore properly no ſpectators of the fact. The phraſe, <hi>in a manner,</hi> ought, I imagine, to have been placed in the end of the ſentence, which would have
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:022387_0139_0FB863B98C671450"/>run thus: <q>to which they, <hi>in a manner,</hi> give their teſtimony:</q> for no direct teſtimony was either aſked of them, or given by them; their belief is inferred from their devotion.</p>
               <p>I have been the more particular in my remarks on the circumſtances of this ſtory, not becauſe there was need of theſe remarks: for, tho' to the eſſayiſt the relation appeared very <hi>memorable,</hi> to me, and, I believe, to moſt people, it appears very <hi>trifling;</hi> but that the reader might have this further ſpecimen of the author's talents in embellithing, To the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, and all other ſuch idle tales, this ſhort and ſimple anſwer will, by every man of ſenſe, be thought ſufficient. <hi>The country where the miracle is ſaid to have been wrought, is</hi> SPAIN; <hi>the people who propagated the faith of it, were</hi> THE CLERGY.

I COME now to conſider the miracles ſaid to have been performed in the church-yard of Saint Medard, at the tomb of <hi>Abbe</hi> Paris.

<pb n="135" facs="unknown:022387_0144_0FB863C798F90930"/>author therefore muſt be underſtood, as ſpeaking with great latitude, when he ſays, <q>There ſurely never was ſo great a number of miracles aſcribed to one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as thoſe which were lately ſaid to have been wrought in France, upon the tomb of <hi>Abbé</hi> Paris, the famous Janſeniſt, with whoſe ſanctity the people were ſo long deluded
<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 195.</note>.</q> If <hi>thouſands</hi> of diſeaſed perſons had applied for medicine to ſome ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant quack, in the aſſurance of his extraordinary abilities; would it be matter of ſurpriſe to a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable man, that, of ſo many, <hi>eight</hi> or <hi>nine</hi> ſhould be ſound, whoſe diſtempers had taken a favourable turn, whilſt they were uſing his ſpecifics, and had there by given countenance to the deluſion? I think it would be matter of ſurpriſe that there were ſo few.</p>
               <p>I ſhall obſerve, <hi>thirdly,</hi> That <hi>impoſture</hi> was actually detected, and proved in ſeveral inſtances. That the reader may be ſatisfied of this, I muſt intreat him to have recourſe to the Archiſhop of Sens' <hi>Paſtoral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions;</hi> a book which Mr Hume could not, with propriety, take any notice of, having poſitively aſſert that <q>the enemies to thoſe opinions, in whoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the miracles were ſaid to have been wrought, were never able diſtinctly to refute or detect them
<note n="†" place="bottom">ib.</note>.</q> This prelate, on the contrary, hath not only given a diſtinct refutation of ſome of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:022387_0145_0FB863C88B4F10B8"/>miracles, but hath clearly detected the deceit and little artifices by which their credit was ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I intend not to deſcend to particulars, and ſhall therefore only refer the reader to the book itſelf, and beg that he will peruſe what relates to the caſes of <hi>Jacques Laurent Menedricuz, Jean Nivet, Sieur le Doulx, Laleu, Anne Coulon,</hi> the widow <hi>de Lorme,</hi> as well as <hi>Mademoiſelle le Franc,</hi> of whom the eſſayiſt hath made mention in a note. In this peruſal, the reader will obſerve the ſhameful prevarications of ſome Janſeniſt witneſſes, for whom Mr Hume would fain apologize, by telling us pleaſantly, they were <hi>tamperd with.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 197. in the note,</note>. I ſhall only add on this head, that the detection of fraud in ſome inſtances, juſtly brings ſuſpicion on all the other inſtances. A man whom I know to have lied to me, on ſeveral occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, I ſhall ſuſpect, on every occaſion, where I have not acceſs to diſcover, whether what he affirms be true or falſe. It is in the ſame way we judge of the ſpirit and conduct of parties, as of individuals.</p>
               <p>I obſerve, <hi>fourthly,</hi> That all the cures recorded by Montgeron, as duly atteſted, were ſuch as might have been effected by <hi>natural</hi> means. There are two kinds of miracles, to which Mr Hume hath alluded in a note, tho' he does not directly make the diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. One is, when the event, conſidered by itſelf, is evidently <hi>preternatural.</hi> Of this kind are, raiſing the dead, walking on water, making whole the mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; for by no natural cauſes can theſe effects be produced. The other kind is, when the event, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by itſelf, is <hi>natural,</hi> that is, may be produced by natural cauſes, but is denominated miraculous,
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:022387_0146_0FB863CA4D7EFC90"/>on account of the manner. That a ſick perſon ſhould be reſtored to health, is not, when conſidered ſingly, preternatural; but that health ſhould be reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tored by the command of a man, undoubtedly is. Let us hear the author on this point: <q>Sometimes an event may not, <hi>in itſelf, ſeem</hi> to be contrary to the laws of nature, and yet, if it were real, it might, by reaſon of ſome circumſtances, be deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated a miracle; becauſe, <hi>in fact,</hi> it is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to theſe laws. Thus, if a perſon claiming a divine authority, ſhould command a ſick perſon to be well, a healthful man to fall down dead, the clouds to pour rain, the winds to blow, in ſhort, ſhould order many natural events, which immediately follow upon his command; theſe might juſtly be eſteemed miracles, becauſe they are really, in this caſe, contrary to the laws of nature. For if any ſuſpicion remain, that the event and command concurred by accident, there is no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, and no tranſgreſſion of the laws of nature. If this ſuſpicion be removed, there is evidently a miracle, and a tranſgreſſion of theſe laws; becauſe nothing can be more contrary to nature, than that the voice or command of a man, ſhould have ſuch an influence
<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 181. in the note.</note>.</q> From what hath been ſaid, it appears, that theſe two kinds of miracles muſt differ conſiderably in reſpect of evidence, ſince the latter naturally gives room for a ſuſpicion, which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely excluded from the former. In the former, when the fact or event is proved, the miracle is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable. In the latter, the fact may be proved and yet the miracle may be juſtly queſtioned. It
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:022387_0147_0FB863CB8695BAE0"/>therefore merits our attention, that all the miracles recorded in Montgeron's collection, were of the ſecond kind. One of the moſt conſiderable of thoſe cures, was that of Don Alphonſo de Palacios, who had loſt one eye, and was diſtreſſed with an inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the other. The inflamed eye was cured, but the loſt eye was not reſtored. Had there been a reproduction of the member which had periſhed, a ſufficient proof of the fact, would have been a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient proof of the miracle. But as the caſe was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, the fact vouched may be admitted, without admitting any miracle. The cures ſaid to have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed on thoſe patients who were afflicted with para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytic or dropſical diſorders, or that performed on Louiſa Coirin, who had a tumour on her breaſt, will not appear to be intitled to a rank in the firſt claſs. As little can the cure of Peter Gautier claim that honour. One of his eyes had been pricked with an awl; in conſequence of which the aqueous humour dropped out, and he became blind of that eye. His ſight was reſtored, whilſt he paid his addreſſes to the <hi>Abbé.</hi> But that a puncture in the cornea of the eye will often heal of itſelf, and that the aqueous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, after it hath been quite loſt, will be recruited, and conſequently, that the faculty of viſion will, in ſuch a caſe, be recovered, is what every oculiſt can aſſure us of. The loſs of the watery humour, is the conſtant effect of a very common operation in ſurgery, couching the cataract. Hence we may learn, how we ought to underſtand theſe words of the author <q>The curing of the ſick, giving hearing to the deaf, and ſight to the blind, were every where talked of
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:022387_0148_0FB863CD31A40200"/>as the uſual effects of that holy ſepulchre
<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 195.</note>.</q> As therefore the alledged miracles were all of the ſecond claſs, 'tis only from the attendant circumſtances we can judge, whether the facts, tho' acknowledged, were miraculous or not.</p>
               <p>In order to enlighten us on this point, I obſerve, <hi>fifthly,</hi> That <hi>none</hi> of the cures were <hi>inſtantaneous.</hi> We have not indeed the ſame hold of the deceaſed <hi>Abbé,</hi> as of a living prophet, who pretends to work miracles. Thoſe who attend the latter, can know exactly, to whom he grants the benefit of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous aid. They can judge alſo, whether the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicant's recovery be coincident, with the prophet's volition or command. In the former caſe, we have not acceſs to judge of either; and conſequently, there is much greater ſcope for fancy and credulity to operate. No voice was ever ſaid to have proceeded from the tomb of the bleſſed deacon, as his votaries ſtyled him. They obtained no audible anſwer to their prayers. There are however ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, by which a probable conjecture may be made concerning the efficiency of the ſaint in the cures aſcribed to him. One is, if the cure inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly followed the firſt devotions at the tomb. Supernatural cures differ, in this particular, as much as in any other, from thoſe which are effected by natural means, that they are not <hi>gradually,</hi> but <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly,</hi> perfected. Now of which kind were the cures of St Medard? From the accounts that are given, 'tis evident, that they were <hi>gradual.</hi> That ſome of them were <hi>ſudden,</hi> is alledged; but that any
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:022387_0149_0FB863D0D8C8E110"/>of them were <hi>inſtantaneous,</hi> or immediately followed the firſt application, is not even pretended. All the worſhippers at the tomb, perſiſted for <hi>days,</hi> ſeveral of them for <hi>weeks,</hi> and ſome for <hi>months</hi> ſucceſſively, daily imploring the interceſſion of the <hi>Abbé,</hi> before they received relief from their complaints; and the relief which was received, is, in moſt caſes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to have been gradual.</p>
               <p>I obſerve, <hi>ſixthly,</hi> That moſt of the devotees either had been uſing <hi>medicines</hi> before, and continued to uſe them, during their applications to the ſaint; or, that their diſtempers had <hi>abated,</hi> before they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ſolicit his help. That the Spaniſh youth had been uſing, all the while a medicine preſcribed by an eminent oculiſt, was proved by the depoſitions of witneſſes; that Gautier had begun to recover his ſight, before he had recourſe to the ſepulchre, was atteſted, not only by his uncle, but even by himſelf, when, as the Archbiſhop of Sens informs us, he ſigned a recantation of what he had formerly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced. With regard to the reſt, it appears at leaſt probable, from the circumſtances of the proof, that they were uſing the preſcriptions of the phyſicians, whom they had conſulted before applying to the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, and who were afterwards required to give their teſtimony, concerning the nature and malignancy of the different diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſeventh</hi> obſervation is, That ſome of the cures atteſted were <hi>incomplete.</hi> Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Not only was ſhe confined to her bed, for many days, after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of her dropſy; but the ſtill remained incapable of moving two of her ſingers. Silva, phyſician to the Duke of Orleans, atteſted this; adding expreſsly, that he <hi>could not look on her as being cured.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>eighth</hi> and laſt obſervation I ſhall make on this ſubject is, That the relief granted ſome of them was but <hi>temporary.</hi> This was clearly proved to be the caſe of the Spaniſh gentleman. That ſoon after his return home, he relapſed into his former malady, the prelate I have often quoted, hath, by the certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates and letters which he procured from Madrid, put beyond controverſy. Among theſe, there are let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from a Spaniſh grandee, Don Francis Xavier, and from the patient's uncle, beſides a certificate ſigned by himſelf.</p>
               <p>After the above obſervations, I believe, there will be no occaſion for ſaying much on this ſubject. The author has, in a note, artfully enough pointed out his aim, that it might not be overlooked by the careleſs reader
<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 196.</note>. "There is another book," ſays he, <q>in three volumes, (called <hi>Recueil des miracles de l' Abbe Paris,</hi>) giving an account of many of theſe miracles, and accompanied with prefatory diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, which are very well wrote
<note n="†" place="bottom">I am ſurpriſed that Mr Hume hath taken no notice of the profound erudition diſplayed in the <hi>Recueil,</hi> as I imagine its au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is much more eminent for this, than for his talent in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Beſides, his learning deſerves our regard the more, that it is of a kind rarely to be met with in the preſent century. Where ſhall we find in theſe dregs of the ages, to adopt his own emphatical expreſſion, ſuch an extenſive knowledge, as he hath exhibited, of all the monkiſh and legendary writings of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt barbarous, or, according to him, the moſt devout ages of the church? Or whence elſe, but from thoſe productons, could he have ſelected ſuch admirable materials for his work? The lives and writings of the ſaints are an inexhauſtible treaſure for a performance of this kind. 'Tis true, St Mathew, St Mark, St Luke, and St John, have ſaid little to his purpoſe, and he makes as little uſe of them. But is not this want richly ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in St Cudbert, St Edildride, St Willibrord, St Baudri, and five hundred others of equal note? One thing however I would gladly be informed of, being utterly at a loſs to account for it. What intitled this author, who ſeems not to be deficient in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration truly catholic for ignorance, ſuperſtition, and barbariſm, to ſpeak contemptibly of Capgravius, Colganus, and Jacobus de Voragine author of <hi>The golden legend?</hi> To be plain with him, this is a freedom which doth not at all become him: for of <hi>the ſew</hi> readers in this age, who happen to be acquainted with the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities quoted in the <hi>Recueil,</hi> moſt, if not all, will, I'm afraid, be of opinion, that the writers laſt mentioned are fully as credible, not leſs famous, and much more ingenious, than many of thoſe to whom he is ſo greatly indebted for his moſt extraordinary nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative. Was it for him then to ſcandalize <hi>theſe few?</hi> 'Tis pity that a writer of ſuch uncommon reading and application ſhould act ſo inconſiſtently, and undermine his own cauſe. But paſſing his literature, which is unqueſtionable, I ſhall give the reader a ſpecimen of his talent in diſputation. To the objection that had been made, that the miracles of the deacon were gradual, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, "So was <hi>the creation,</hi> the firſt of miracles, which employed no leſs than ſix days." As all that was done in that time, is comprehended under <hi>one name,</hi> THE CREATION, he concludes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſagely, that it ought to be denominated <hi>one miracle.</hi> A wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this ſtamp would no doubt deſpiſe the anſwer which an ordinary reader might make him,—<hi>firſt,</hi> That every ſingle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction was a perfect miracle,—<hi>ſecondly,</hi> That nothing could be more inſtantaneous than thoſe productions, <hi>God ſaid, let there be light, and there was light, &amp;c.</hi>—and <hi>laſtly,</hi> That the world was not created by the miniſtration of man, nor in the preſence of men, nor in order to ſerve as evidence of any doctrine. I muſt be forgiven to remark, that in the whole of this author's reply, he hath unfortunately miſtaken the meaning of the objectors, who intend not to ſay, that God may not perform a miracle gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually, but that what is ſo performed, hath not the ſame evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of its being miraculous, as what is done in an inſtant, and therefore cannot ſo well ſerve as evidence of any doctrine. Now that the miracles of Monſieur de Paris were intended as evidence of his doctrine, and conſequently of that of the appellants from the bull <hi>Unigenitus,</hi> he every where vehemently maintains. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpecimen of this author's acuteneſs and ingenuity I ſhall give in a literal tranſlation from his own words. <q>But, it will be ſaid, in the earlieſt times of the church, miraculous cures were commonly perfected in an inſtant. True; and 'tis this which confirms my doctrine. As it was ordinary then, to convert great ſinners all of a ſudden. But ſuch wonders in both kinds are for the commencement of the church, or for the renovation promiſed her. In theſe days, which the French clergy have juſtly ſtyled <hi>the dregs of the ages,</hi> 'tis much that God convert many ſinners, and cure many ſick, by ſlow degrees, at the ſame time that he ſhows by ſome more ſhining exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that his arm is not ſhortened.</q>
                     </note>.</q> He adds,
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:022387_0151_0FB863D594D0BC40"/>
                  <q>There runs however, thro' the whole of theſe a a ridiculous compariſon betwixt the miracles of our
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:022387_0152_0FB863D6C7B93FC8"/>Saviour and thoſe of the <hi>Abbé;</hi> wherein 'tis aſſerted, that the evidence for the latter is equal to that for the former
<note n="†" place="bottom">I am ſorry to be again ſo ſoon laid under the neceſſity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, that the eſſayiſt, by confiding too much in his memory, often injures the writers whom he quot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>. It is but doing juſtice to the author of the <hi>Recueil,</hi> to obſerve, that he hath, in no part of his performance, aſſerted that the evidence for the miracles of Monſieur de Paris is equal to that for the miracles of Jeſus Chriſt. Perhaps my reader will be ſurpriſed when I tell him, for I own I was exceedingly ſurpriſed when I diſcovered, that he hath not only in the plaineſt terms aſſerted, but ſtrenuouſly maintained, the contrary. And for this purpoſe he hath employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no leſs than twelve pages of his work. He introduces the ſubject (Diſcourſe 2. part 1.) with obſerving, that he and the reſt of his party had been traduced by their adverſaries, as equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the miracles of the deacon to thoſe of our Saviour. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety of ſuch a compariſon he mentions with horror, and treats the charge as an abſolute calumny. Hence he takes occaſion to enuinerate thoſe peculiar circumſtances in the miracles of our Lord, which gave them an eminent ſuperiority, not only over thoſe of his ſaint, but over thoſe of every other ſaint, or prophet whatſoever.

We acknowledge, we inculcate this truth.</q> Afterwards, ſpeaking of evidence, he owns alſo, that the miracles of the deacon are not equally certain with thoſe of Jeſus Chriſt. The latter, he ſays, are more certain in many reſpects. He ſpecifies the natural notoriety of ſome of the facts, the public and inſtantaneous manner in which moſt of them were offected, the number, the quality, the conſtancy of the witneſſes, and the ſerced acknowledgement of his moſt ſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enemies. He concludes this ſubject in theſe memorable terms.

<pb n="146" facs="unknown:022387_0155_0FB863DFB41AB6F0"/>God himſelf, who conducted the pen of the inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red writers.</q> An ingenious piece of raillery with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtion. Is it poſſible, in a politer man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or in more obliging terms, to tell the Chriſtian world, <hi>They are fools;</hi> and that all who are ſilly enough to believe the miracles recorded in ſcripture, are not intitled to be argued with as <hi>men?</hi> How? They are ſo abſurd as to believe the ſcriptures to be the word of God, on the evidence of the miracles wrought by our Lord and his apoſtles; and that theſe miracles were wrought, they could not believe on any teſtimony, leſs than that of God, reporting them in the ſcriptures: and thus, by making inſpiration and miracles reciprocally foundations to each other, they, in effect, admit both without any foundation at all. After this handſome compliment to the friends of holy writ, he thinks himſelf at liberty to be very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit on the comparative evidence of the miracles of the <hi>Abbè,</hi> and thoſe of Jeſus: <q>If theſe writers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed were to be conſidered merely as human teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, the French author is <hi>very moderate</hi> in his compariſon; ſince he might, <hi>with ſome appearance of reaſon,</hi> pretend, that the Janſeniſt miracles <hi>much ſurpaſs</hi> the other, in evidence and authority.</q> Was ever ſo rough an aſſault, preceded by ſo ſmooth, but ſo inſidious a preamble? Is it then ſtill the fate of Jeſus to be betrayed with a kiſs? But notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this author's declaration, no Chriſtian will have reaſon to dread the iſſue of the compariſon. Mr Hume hath not entered on particulars, neither ſhall I enter on them. I ſhould not incline to tire my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with repetitions, which, in a minute inquiry,
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:022387_0156_0FB863E1E8A60950"/>would be inevitable. I ſhall therefore only deſire him, if he think it needful, to peruſe a ſecond time the eight foregoing obſervations. Let him try the miracles of our Lord by this touch ſtone; and I perſuade myſelf, he will be ſatisfied, that there is <hi>no appearance of reaſon</hi> to pretend, that the Janſeniſt miracles <hi>much ſurpaſs</hi> the other, or even equal them, in evidence and authority.</p>
               <p>The author triumphs not a little in the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the reports of the prodigies performed by the deacon, were violently oppoſed by the civil ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, and by the Jeſuits, the moſt learned ſociety in the kingdom. He could ſee the importance of this circumſtance in the the caſe of <hi>Abbè</hi> Paris, tho' not in the caſe of Jeſus Chriſt. But that the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the caſes as well as their reſemblance, may better appear; it ought likewiſe to be obſerved, that Janſeniſm, tho' not the <hi>ruling</hi> faction, was at that time the <hi>popular</hi> faction; that this popularity was not the effect of the miracles of the <hi>Abbè,</hi> but ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to thoſe miracles; that, on the contrary, the Jeſuits were extremely <hi>unpopular;</hi> and that many, who had no more faith in the miracles of Saint Medard than Mr Hume hath, were well pleaſed to connive at a deluſion, which at once plagued and mortified a body of men, that were become almoſt univerſally odious.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only add, that nothing could more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually expoſe the folly of thoſe pretenſions, than the expedient by which they were made to ceaſe: In conſequence of an order from the King, the ſepulchre was incloſed with a wall, and the votaries were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:022387_0157_0FB863E2D042DB68"/>barred from approaching the tomb. The author ſays, in relation to this
<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 198. in the note.</note>, <q>No Janſeniſt was ever em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſed to account for the ceſſation of the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, when the churchyard was ſhut up by the Kings edict.</q> Certain it is, that <q>God is maſter of his own graces and works.</q> But it is equally certain, that neither reaſon nor the goſpel leads us to think, that any human expedient will prove ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, which is calculated to fruſtrate the decrees of Heaven. Both, on the contrary, teach us, that men never more directly <hi>promote</hi> the deſigns of their Maker than when they intend directly to <hi>oppoſe</hi> them. It was not thus, that either Phariſees or Sadducees, Jews or Gentiles, ſucceded in their oppoſition to the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Jeſus and his apoſtles. The opinion of Gamaliel
<note n="†" place="bottom">Actsv 38.39.</note> was undoubtedly judicious: <hi>If this counſel or this work be of men, it will come to nought; but if it be of God, ye</hi> CANNOT <hi>overthrow it; beware therefore, leſt ye be found fighting even againſt God.</hi> To conclude; Did the Janſeniſt cauſe derive any advantage from thoſe preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded miracles? None at all. It even ſuffered by them. It is juſtly remarked by Voltaire
<note n="‡" place="bottom">Siccle de Louis XIV. chap. 33.</note>, that <q>the tomb of the deacon Paris, proved in effect, in the minds of all people of ſenſe, the tomb of Janſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm:</q> How unlike in all reſpects the miracles recorded by the Evangeliſts!</p>

There is, however, one queſtion diſtinct from the former, tho' akin to it, which, even from the principles of reaſon, we may with great probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:022387_0159_0FB863E5C78D45F8"/>determine. The queſtion I mean is, Whether the world had an origin or not?</p>
               <p>That there hath been an infinite, eternal, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent ſeries of finite, ſucceſſive, and dependent beings, ſuch as men, and conſequently that the world had no beginning, appears, from the bare conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the thing, extremely incredible, if not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abſurd. The abſtract argument uſed on this head, might appear too metaphyſical and refined: I ſhall not therefore introduce it; but ſhall recur to to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pics which are more familiar, and which, tho' they do not demonſtrate, that it is abſolutely impoſſible that <hi>the world hath exiſted from eternity,</hi> clearly evince that is highly improbable, or rather, certainly falſe. Theſe topics I ſhall only mention, as they are pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty obvious, and have been often urged with great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ergy by the learned, both ancient and modern. Such are, the late invention of letters, and of all the ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and arts by which human life is civilized; the known origin of moſt nations, ſtates and kingdoms; and the firſt peopling of many countries. 'Tis in our power at preſent to trace the hiſtory of every people, backwards to times of the greateſt barbarity and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. Europe, tho' not the largeſt of the four parts into which the earth is divided, is, on many ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, the moſt conſiderable. But what a different face doth Europe wear at preſent, from what it wore three thouſand years ago? How immenſe the odds in knowledge, in arts, in policy, in every thing? How eaſy is the intercourſe, and how extenſive the acquaintance, which men can now enjoy with all, even the remoteſt regions of the globe, compared with
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:022387_0160_0FB863EB8257CEC8"/>what was, or could have been enjoyed, in that time of darkneſs and ſimplicity? A man differs not more from a child, than the human race now differs from the human race then. Three thouſand years ago, appear indeed to mark a very diſtant epoch; and yet it is but as yeſterday, compared with eternity. This, when duly weighed, every thinking perſon will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to be as ſtrong moral evidence, as the ſubject can admit, (and that I imagine is very ſtrong) that the world had a beginning.</p>
               <p>I ſhall make a ſuppoſition, which will perhaps ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear whimſical, but which will tend to elucidate the argument I am enforcing. In antediluvian times, when the longevity of man was ſuch as to include ſome centuries, I ſhall ſuppoſe, that a few boys had been imported to a deſart iſland, and there left toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, juſt old enough to make ſhift to ſuſtain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as thoſe in the golden age are fabled to have done, on acorns, and other ſpontaneous productions of the ſoil. I ſhall ſuppoſe, that they had lived there for ſome hundreds of years, had remembered nothing of their coming into the iſland, nor of any other perſon whatſoever; and that thus they had never had acceſs to know, or hear, of either birth or death. I ſhall ſuppoſe them to enter into a ſerious diſquiſition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their own duration, the queſtion having been ſtarted, Whether they had exiſted from eternity, or had once begun to be? They recur to memory, but memory can furniſh them nothing certain or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſive. If it muſt be allowed that it contains no trace of beginning of exiſtence, it muſt alſo be allowed, that it reaches not beyond a few centuries at moſt.
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:022387_0161_0FB863ED4B985E58"/>They obſerve beſides, concerning this faculty, that the further back it goes, it becomes the more indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, terminating at laſt in confuſion and darkneſs. Some things however they diſtinctly recollect, and are aſſured of. They remember, they were once of much lower ſtature, and of ſmaller ſize; they had leſs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſtrength; and all their mental faculties were wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker. They know, that, in the powers both of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and of mind, they have advanced, by impercept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible degrees, to the pitch they are now arrived at. Theſe conſiderations, eſpecially when fortified by ſome analogous obſervations they might have made on the growth of herbs and trees, would have ſhown the probability to be entirely on the ſide of thoſe who aſſerted, that their exiſtence had a beginning: And tho', on account of the narrow ſphere of their knowledge and experience, the argument could not have appeared to them in all its ſtrength, we, from our long acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with nature, even abſtracting from our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of man in particular, muſt be ſatisfied, that it would have been ſtrictly analogical and juſt. Exactly <hi>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar,</hi> the very <hi>ſame,</hi> I ſhould rather ſay, is the argument I have been urging for the origination of the ſpecies. Make but a few alterations in phraſeology: for <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,</hi> ſubſtitute <hi>hiſtory and tradition;</hi> for <hi>hundreds of</hi> years, ſay <hi>thouſands;</hi> for <hi>the powers of body and mind,</hi> put <hi>the arts and ſciences;</hi> and, with theſe, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps one or two more ſuch variations, you will find the argument as applicable in the one caſe, as in the other. Now, if it be granted, that the human ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies muſt have had a beginning, it will hardly be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned, that every other animal ſpecies, or even that the univerſe, muſt have had a beginning.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="unknown:022387_0162_0FB863EEC80D6E90"/>
BUT in order to prove the propoſition laid down in the title of this ſection, 'tis not neceſſary to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that the world had a beginning. Admit it had not, and obſerve the conſequence. Thus much muſt be admitted alſo, that not barely for a <hi>long continued,</hi> but for an ETERNAL, ſucceſſion of generations, mankind were in a ſtate little ſuperior to the beaſts; that of a ſudden, there came a moſt aſtoniſhing change upon the ſpecies; that they exerted talents and capacities, of which there appeared not the ſmalleſt veſtige, during the eternity preceding; that they acquired ſuch knowledge as procured them a kind of empire, not only over the vegetable and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal worlds, but even, in ſome reſpect, over the elements, and all the unwieldy powers of matter; that, in conſequence of this, they were quickly raiſed, much more above the ſtate they had been formerly and eternally in, than ſuch their former and eternal ſtate was above that of the brute creation. If ſuch a revolution in nature, ſuch a thorough, general, and ſudden change as this, would not be denominated miraculous, 'tis not in my power to conceive what would. I could not eſteem it a greater miracle, hardly ſo great, that any ſpecies of beaſts, which have hitherto been doomed to tread the earth, ſhould now get wings, and float about in the air.</p>
               <p>Nor will this plea be ſubverted by that trite ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, That mankind may have been as much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, perhaps myriads of years ago, as they are at preſent; but that by ſome <hi>univerſal</hi> calamity, ſuch as deluge or conflagration, which, after the rotation of many centuries, the earth poſſibly becomes liable
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:022387_0163_0FB863F304D9E1E0"/>to, all traces of crudition and of ſcience, all traces both of the elegant and of the uſeful arts, may have been effaced, and the human race, ſpringing from a few who had eſcaped the common ruin, may have emerged anew, out of barbarity and ignorance. This hypotheſis doth but ſubſtitute one miracle in the place of another. Such general diſorder is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely unconformable to our experience of the courſe of nature. Accordingly the deſtruction of the world by a deluge, the author hath numbered among thoſe prodigies, or miracles, which render the Pentate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch perfectly incredible.</p>
               <p>IF, on the contrary, we admit, that the world had a beginning, (and will not every thinking perſon acknowledge, that this poſition is much more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable than the contrary?) the production of the world muſt be aſcribed either to <hi>chance,</hi> or to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Shall we derive all things, ſpiritual and corporeal, from a principle ſo inſignificant as blind <hi>chance?</hi> Shall we ſay, with Epicurus, that the fortuitous courſe of rambling atoms hath reared this beautiful and ſtupendous fabric? In that caſe, perhaps, we ſhould give an account of the origin of things, which, moſt people will think, could not properly be ſtyled miraculous. But is it, becauſe the formation of a grand and regular ſyſtem in this way, is conformable to the experienced order of nature? Quite the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. Nothing can be more repugnant to univerſal experience, than that the leaſt organic body, not to mention the glorious frame of nature, ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:022387_0164_0FB863F6104E1280"/>by ſuch a caſual jumble. It has therefore, in the higheſt degree poſſible, that particular quality of miracles, from which, according to the author's the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory, their incredibility reſults, and may doubtleſs, in this looſe acceptation of the word, be termed <hi>mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.</hi> But ſhould we affirm, that, to account thus for the origin of the univerſe, is to account for it by miracle; we ſhould be thought, I'm afraid, to ſpeak both weakly and improperly. There is ſomething here, if I may ſo expreſs myſelf, which is far beyond the miraculous; ſomething, for which I know not whether any language can afford a proper appellation, unleſs it be the general appellations of <hi>abſurdity</hi> and <hi>nonſenſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Shall we then at laſt recur to the common doctrine, that the world was produced by an <hi>intelligent cauſe?</hi> On this ſuppoſition alſo, tho' incomparably the moſt rational, it is evident, that in the creation, formation, or firſt production of things, call it by what name you pleaſe, a power muſt have been exerted, which, in reſpect of the preſent courſe of nature, may be ſtyled <hi>miraculous.</hi> I intend not to diſpute about a word, nor to inquire, whether that term can, in ſtrict propriety, be uſed of any exertions before the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the laws of nature. I uſe the word in the ſame latitude, in which the author commonly uſeth it in his reaſoning, for every event that is not conformable to that courſe of nature with which we are acquainted by experience.</p>
               <p>WHETHER, therefore, the world <hi>had,</hi> or <hi>had not, a beginning;</hi> whether, on the <hi>firſt</hi> ſuppoſition, the
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:022387_0165_0FB863F71E51BBE8"/>production of things be aſcribed to <hi>chance,</hi> or to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign;</hi> whether, on the <hi>ſecond,</hi> in order to ſolve the numberleſs objections that ariſe, we <hi>do,</hi> or <hi>do not,</hi> recur to univerſal <hi>cataſtrophes;</hi> there is no poſſibility of accounting for the phenomena that preſently come under our notice, without having at laſt recourſe to MIRACLES; that is, to events altogether uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſormable, or, if you will, contrary to the preſent courſe of nature known to us by experience. I cannot conceive an hypotheſis, which is not reducible to one or other of thoſe above-mentioned. Whoever imagines, that another might be framed, which is not comprehended in any of thoſe, and which hath not as yet been deviſed by any ſyſtem-builder; let him make the experiment, and I will venture to prognoſticate, that he will ſtill find himſelf clogged with the ſame difficulty. The concluſion therefore above deduced, may be juſtly deemed, till the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is ſhown, to be not only the reſult of one, but alike of every hypotheſis, of which the ſubject is ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible.</p>
               <p>THUS it hath been evinced, as was propoſed, that abſtracting from the evidence for particular facts, we have irrefragable evidence, that there have been, that there muſt have been, <hi>miracles</hi> in former times, or ſuch events, as when, compared with the preſent conſtitution of the world, would by Mr Hume be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated miraculous.</p>

The contraſt we diſcern betwixt the ISRAELITES, and the ancient GREEKS and ROMANS, is remarkable. The GRFEKS and ROMANS, on all the ſubjects of human erudition, on all the liberal and the uſeful arts, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned like <hi>men;</hi> on the ſubject of religion, they prated like <hi>children.</hi> The ISRAELITES, on the contrary, in all the ſciences and arts, were <hi>children;</hi> but, in their notions of religion, they were <hi>men;</hi> in the doctrines, for example, of the unity, the eternity, the omnipotence, the omniſcience, the omnipreſence, the wiſdom, and the goodneſs of God; in their opinions concerning providence, and creation, the preſervation and government of the world; opinions ſo exalted and comprehenſive, as, even by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's acknowledgment, could never enter into the thoughts of barbarians.</p>
               <p>But to proceed in the reviſal: We have here a book, ſays the eſſayiſt, "wrote in all probability long after the facts it relates." That this book was written long after <hi>ſome</hi> of the facts it relates, is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed denied: that it was written long after <hi>all,</hi> or even <hi>moſt</hi> of thoſe facts, I ſee no reaſon to believe. If
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:022387_0169_0FB863FD466446B8"/>Mr Hume meant to ſignify, by the expreſſion quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that this was in all probability the caſe, why did he not produce the grounds on which the probability is founded? Shall a bold aſſertion paſs for argument? or can it be expected, that any one ſhould conſider reaſons, which are only in general ſuppoſed, but not ſpecified?</p>
               <p>He adds, <q>corroborated by no <hi>concurring</hi> teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</q> as little, ſay I, invalidated by any <hi>contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> teſtimony; and both, for this plain reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no human compoſition, that can be compared with this, in reſpect of antiquity. But tho' this book is not corroborated by the concurrent teſtimony of any coeval hiſtories, becauſe, if there ever were ſuch hiſtories, they are not now extant; it is not therefore deſtitute of all collateral evidence. The following examples of this kind of evidence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſome notice. The diviſion of time into weeks, which hath obtained in many countries, for inſtance among the Egyptians, Chineſe, Indians, and nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern barbarians; nations whereof ſome had little or no intercourſe with others, and were not even known by name to the Hebrews
<note n="*" place="bottom">The judicious reader will obſerve, that there is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the concurrence of nations, in the diviſion of time into <hi>weeks,</hi> and their concurrence in the other periodical diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, into <hi>years, months, days.</hi> Theſe diviſions ariſe from ſuch natural cauſes, as are every where obvious; the annual and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnal revolutions of the ſun, and the revolution of the moon.

'Tis eaſy to conceive, that the practice, in rude and barbarous ages, might remain, thro' habit, when the tradition, on which it was found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was entirely loſt; 'tis eaſy to conceive, that afterwards, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple addicted to idolatry, or who, like the Egyptians, had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<note n="*" place="bottom">This in particular merits our attention the more, that it cannot, by any explication, be made to agree with the doctrine which obtained among the Pagans, commonly called <hi>the Mytho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.</hi> Ovid is ſo ſenſible of this that, when he mentions a dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as the efficient cauſe of the creation, he leaves him, as it were, detached from thoſe of the popular ſyſtem, which it was his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs as a poet to deliver, being at a loſs what name to give him, or what place in nature to aſſign him. Quiſquis fuit ille deorum. <hi>Whichever of the gods it was.</hi> He well knew that, in all the catalogue of their divinities, the god who made the world was not to be found, that theſe divinities themſelves were, on the contary, produced out of the chaos, as well as men and beaſts. Mr Hume in his <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hiſtory of religion,</hi> IV. remarks this conduct in Ovid, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes it to his having lived in a learned age, and having been inſtructed by philoſophers in the principle of a divine formation of the world. For my part, I very much queſtion, whether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny nation was ever yet indebted, for this principle, to the diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of philoſophers. Had this opinion never been heard of, till the Auguſtan age, it might indeed have been ſuſpected, that it was the daughter of philoſophy and ſcience, but ſo far is this from being the caſe, that ſome veſtiges of it may be traced even in the earlieſt, and moſt ignorant times.

At the ſame time I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that there is ſomething ſo noble and ſo rational in the principle, <hi>That the world was produced by an intelligent cauſe,</hi> that ſound philoſophy will ever be ready to adopt it, when once it is propoſed. But that this opinion is not the offspring of philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, may be reaſonably deduced from this conſideration alſo, that they were not the moſt enlightened or philoſophic nations, amongſt whom it was maintained in greateſt purity. I ſpeak not of the Hebrews. Even the Parthians, Medes and Perſians, whom the Greeks conſidered as barbarians, were genuine theiſts, and notwithſtanding many ſuperſtitious practices which prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among them, they held the belief of one eternal God the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator and the lord of the univerſe. If this principle is to be deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the utmoſt improvement of the mind in ratiocination and ſcience, which is Mr Hume's hypotheſis, the phenomenon juſt now obſerved is unaccountable. If, on the contrary, it is to be derived originally from revelation, preſerved by tradition, thro' ſucceſſive genrations, nothing can more caſily be accounted for. Traditions are always longeſt retained, and moſt purely tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, in or near the place where they were firſt received, and amongſt a people who poſſeſs a ſtrong attachment to their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent laws and cuſtoms. Migrations into diſtant countries, mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of different nations, revolutions in government and maners, yea and ingenuity itſelf, all contribute to corrupt tradition, and do ſometimes wholly efface it. This I take to be the only admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible account, why ſo rational and ſo philoſophical a principle pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed moſt in ages and countries in which reaſon and philoſophy ſeemed to be but in their infancy. The notion, that the Greeks borrowed their opinions on this ſubject from the books of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, a notion for which ſome Jewiſh writers, ſome Chriſtian fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and even ſome moderns have warmly contended, appears void of all foundation. Theſe opinions in Greece, as hath been obſerved, were of a very early date; whereas that there exiſted ſuch a people as the Jews, ſeems ſcarce to have been known there till about the time of the Macedonian conqueſts. No ſooner were they known than they were hated, and their laws and cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms univerſally deſpiſed.

               <p>But to return: The author ſubjoins, <q>reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling thoſe fabulous accounts, which every nation gives of its origin.</q> 'Tis unluckily the fate of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly writ with this author that both its reſemblance,
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:022387_0173_0FB8640866941D28"/>and its want of reſemblance, to the accounts of other authors, are alike preſumptions againſt it. He hath not indeed told us, wherein it reſembles fabulous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts: and, for my part, tho' the charge were juſt I ſhould imagine, little or nothing to the diſadvantage of the Pentateuch, could be deduced from it. It is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally agreed among the learned, that even the moſt abſurd fables of idolaters, derive their origin from facts, which having been, in barbarous ages, tranſmitted only by oral tradition, have come at length to be groſsly corrupted and disfigured. 'Tis nevertheleſs probable, that ſuch fictions would ſtill retain ſome ſtricking features of thoſe truths, from which they ſprung. And if the books of Moſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble, in any thing, the fabulous accounts of other nations, it would not perhaps be difficult to prove, that they reſemble only whatever is leaſt fabulous in theſe accounts. That this will be found to be the caſe, we may reaſonably preſume, even from what hath been obſerved already; and if ſo, the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, ſo far from being an argument againſt thoſe books, is evidently an argument in their favour. In order to remove any doubt that may remain on this head, it ought to be attended to, that, in a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of concurrent teſtimonies, (where there could have been no previous concert) there is a probability in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of that which reſults from our faith in the witneſſes: nay, ſhould the witneſſes be of ſuch a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter as to merit no faith at all. This probability ariſeth from the <hi>concurrence</hi> itſelf. That ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence ſhould ſpring from <hi>chance,</hi> is as one to infinite, in other words, morally impoſſible: if therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert be excluded, there remains no other cauſe but the reality of the fact.</p>

'Tis true, that <q>upon reading this book, we find it ful of prodigies and miracles:</q> but 'tis alſo true, that many of thoſe miracles are ſuch, as the ſubject it treats of, muſt unavoidably make us expect. For a proof of this poſition, I need but refer the reader to the principles eſtabliſhed in the preceding ſection. No book in the world do we find written in a more ſimple ſtyle; no where does there appear in it, the leaſt affectation of ornament; yet nowhere elſe is the Almighty repreſented, as either acting or ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a manner ſo becoming the eternal ruler of the world. Compare the account of the CREATION which is given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> with the ravings of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choniatho the <hi>Phenician</hi> philoſopher, which he had dignified with the title of COSMOGONY: or compare it with the childiſh extravagancies of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> poets, ſo juſtly likened by the author to a ſick <hi>man's dreams</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Natural hiſtory of religion. XV.</note>; and then ſay, whether any perſon of candour and diſcernment will not be diſpoſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim in the word, of the prophet, <hi>What is the</hi> CHAFF <hi>to the</hi> WHEAT
<note n="†" place="bottom">Jer. xxiii. 28.</note>! The account is what we ſhould call in reference to experience, <hi>miraculous.</hi> But was it poſſible it ſhould be otherwiſe? I believe the greateſt infidel will not deny, that it is at leaſt as plauſible an opinion that the world had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining, as that it had not. If it had, can it be imagined by any man in his ſenſes, that that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar quality ſhould be an objection to the narrative, which he previouſly knows it muſt have? Muſt not the firſt production of things, the original formation of animals and vegetables, require exertions of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:022387_0175_0FB8640DA13FF298"/>which, in preſervation and propagation, can never be exemplified?</p>
               <p>It will perhaps be objected, That if the miracles continued no longer, and extended no further, than the neceſſity of creation required, this reaſoning would be juſt; but that in fact they both continued much longer, and extended much further. The anſwer is obvious: it is impoſſible for us to judge, how far the neceſſity of the caſe required. Immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the creation, things muſt have been in a ſtate ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry different from that which they are in at preſent. How long that ſtate might continue, we have not the means of diſcovering: but as, in human in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, 'tis neceſſary that the feeble creature ſhould, for ſome time, be carried in the nurſe's arms, and afterwards, by the help of leading ſtrings, be kept from falling, before he acquire, ſtrength to walk; 'tis not unlikely, that in the infancy of the world, ſuch interpoſitions ſhould be more frequent and requiſite, till nature attainining a certain maturity, thoſe laws and that conſtitution ſhould be eſtabliſhed, which we now experience. It will greatly ſtrengthen this concluſion, to reflect, that in every ſpecies of natural productions, with which we are acquainted, we invariably obſerve a ſimilar feebleneſs in the indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals on their firſt appearance, and a ſimilar gradation towards a ſtate of greater perfection and ſtability. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if we acknowledge the neceſſity of the exerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a power, which only in reference to our expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience is called miraculous, the queſtion, as is well obſerved by the judicious prelate formerly quoted
<note n="*" place="bottom">Analogy of religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> part 2. chap. 2. ſect. 2.</note>, <q>whether this power ſtopped immediately, after it
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:022387_0176_0FB8640F08220030"/>had made man, or went on and exerted itſelf farther, is a queſtion of the ſame kind, as whether an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary power exerted itſelf in ſuch a particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and manner, or not.</q> It cannot therefore, if we think reaſonably on this ſubject, greatly aſtoniſh us, that ſuch a book ſhould give <q>an account of a ſtate of the world, and of human nature, entirely different from the preſent; of our fall from that ſtate; of the age of man extended to near a thouſand years; and of the deſtruction of the world by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, if, in ſuch a book, mingled with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies I have remarked, there ſhould appear ſome difficulties, ſome things for which we are not able to account; for inſtance, <q>the arbitrary choice of one people, as the favourites of Heaven; and their deliverance from bondage by prodigies the moſt aſtoniſhing imaginable;</q> is there any thing more extraordinary here, than, in a compoſition of this nature, we might have previouſly expected to find? We muſt be immoderately conceited of our own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, if we imagine otherwiſe. Thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites of Heaven, it muſt be likewiſe owned, are the countrymen of the writer; but of ſuch a writer, as of all hiſtorians or annaliſts, ancient or modern, ſhows the leaſt diſpoſition to flatter his countrymen. Where, I pray, do we find him, either celebrating their virtues, or palliating their vices; either extolling their genius, or magnifying their exploits? Add to all theſe, that, in every thing which is not expreſsly aſcribed to the interpoſal of Heaven, the relation is in itſelf plauſible, the incidents are natural, the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:022387_0177_0FB86410CFF9A538"/>and manners ſuch as are admirably adapted to thoſe early ages of the world. In theſe particulars, there is no affectation of the marvellous; there are no <q>deſcriptions of ſea and land monſters; no relations of wonderful adventures, ſtrange men, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth manners

               </p>
               <p>WHEN all theſe things are ſeriouſly attended to, I perſuade myſelf, that no unprejudiced perſon will think, that the Pentateuch bears falſehood on the face of it, and deſerves to be rejected without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination. On the contrary, every unprejudiced perſon will find (I ſay not, that its falſehood would be more miraculous, then all the miracles it relates; this is a language which I do not underſtand, and which only ſerves to darken a plain queſtion; but I ſay, he will find) very many and very ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications of authenticity and truth; and will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that all the evidences, both intrinſic and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſic, by which it is ſupported, ought to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially canvaſſed. Abundant evidences there are of both kinds; ſome hints of them have been given in this ſection; but to conſider them fully, falls not within the limits of my preſent purpoſe.</p>

            <p>"OUR moſt holy religion," ſays the author in the concluſion of his eſſay, <q>is founded on faith, not on reaſon; and 'tis a ſure method of expoſing it, to put it to ſuch a trial, as it is by no means fitted to endure.</q> If, by <hi>our moſt holy religion,</hi> we are to underſtand the fundamental articles of the Chriſtian ſyſtem, theſe have their foundation in the nature and decrees of God; and, as they are antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to our faith or reaſonings, they muſt be alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of both. If they are true, our diſbelief can never make them falſe; if they are falſe, the belief of all the world will never make them true. But as the only queſtion between Mr Hume and the defenders of the goſpel, is, Whether there is reaſon to believe thoſe articles? he can only mean by <hi>our moſt holy religion,</hi> our belief of the Chriſtian doctrine: and concerning this belief we are told, that it is founded on <hi>faith,</hi> not on reaſon; that is, our faith is founded on our faith; in other words, it hath no foundation, it is a mere chimera, the creature of a diſtempered brain. I ſay not on the contrary, that <hi>our moſt holy religion</hi> is founded on <hi>reaſon,</hi> becauſe this expreſſion, in my opinion, is both ambiguous and inaccurate; but I ſay that we have ſufficient reaſon for the belief of our religion; or, to expreſs myſelf in the words of an apoſtle, that the Chriſtian, if it is not his own fault, may <hi>be ready always to give an anſwer to every man, that aſketh</hi> him <hi>a</hi> REASON <hi>of</hi> his <hi>hope,</hi>

So far therefore am I from being afraid of expoſing Chriſtianity by ſubmitting it to the teſt of reaſon; ſo far am I from judging this a trial, which it is by no means fitted to endure, that I think, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the moſt violent attacks that have been made upon the faith of Jeſus, have been of ſervice to it. Yes: I do not heſitate to affirm, that our religion hath been indebted to the <hi>attempts,</hi> tho' not to the <hi>intentions,</hi> of its bittereſt enemies. They have tried its ſtrength indeed, and, by trying, they have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played its ſtrength; and that in ſo clear a light, as we could never have hoped, without ſuch a trial, to have viewed it in. Let them therefore write, let them argue, and, when arguments fail, even let them cavil againſt religion as much as they pleaſe: I ſhould be heartily ſorry, that ever in this iſland, the aſylum of liberty, where the ſpirit of Chriſtianity is better underſtood (however defective the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are in the obſervance of its precepts) than in any other part of the Chriſtian world; I ſhould, I ſay, be ſorry, that in this iſland, ſo great a diſſervice were done to religion, as to check its adverſaries, in any other way, than by returning a candid anſwer to their objections. I muſt at the ſame time ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that I am both aſhamed and grieved, when I obſerve any friends of religion, betray ſo great a diffidence in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>ONE word more with the eſſayiſt, and I have done. "Upon the whole," ſays he, <q>we may conclude, that the <hi>Chriſtian religion,</hi> not only was at firſt atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with miracles, but even, at this day, cannot be believed by any reaſonable perſon without one. More reaſon is inſufficient to convince us of its ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity; and whoever is moved by faith to aſſent to it;</q> that is, whoever by his belief is induced to believe it, <q>is conſcious of a continued miracle in his own perſon, which ſubverts all the principles of his underſtanding, and gives him a determination to believe, what is moſt contrary to cuſtom and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</q> An author is never ſo ſure of writing unanſwerably, as when he writes altogether unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligibly. 'Tis impoſſible that you ſhould fight your enemy before you find him; and if he hath ſcreened himſelf in darkneſs, 'tis next to impoſſible that you ſhould find him. Indeed, if any meaning can be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from that ſtrange aſſemblage of words juſt now quoted, it ſeems to be one or other of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſe which follow: <hi>either,</hi> That there are not any in the world, who believe the goſpel; <hi>or,</hi> That there is no want of miracles in our own time. How either of theſe remarks, if juſt, can contribute to the author's pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, it will not, I ſuſpect, be eaſy to diſcover. If
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:022387_0182_0FB8641E017467F0"/>the ſecond remark is true, if there is no want of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles at preſent, ſurely experience cannot be pleaded againſt the belief of miracles ſaid to have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in time paſt. Again, if the firſt remark is true, if there are not any in the world who believe the goſpel, becauſe, as Mr Hume ſuppoſeth, a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle cannot be believed without a new miracle, why all this ado to refute opinions which nobody enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains? Certainly, to uſe his own words, <q>The knights-errant, who wandered about to clear the world of dragons and giants, never entertained the the leaſt doubt concerning the exiſtence of theſe monſters

            </p>
            <p>Might I preſume faintly to copy but the manner of ſo inimitable an original, as the author hath exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his concluding words, I ſhould alſo conclude upon the whole, That miracles are capable of proof from teſtimony, and there is a full proof of this kind, for thoſe ſaid to have been wrought in ſupport of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; that whoever is moved, by M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Hume's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious argument, to aſſert, that no teſtimony can give ſufficient evidence of miracles, admits for <hi>reaſon,</hi> tho' perhaps unconſcious, a mere <hi>ſubtilty,</hi> which ſubverts the evidence of teſtimony, of hiſtory, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of experience itſelf, giving him a determination to deny, what the common ſenſe of mankind, founded in the primary principles of the underſtanding, would lead him to believe.</p>
