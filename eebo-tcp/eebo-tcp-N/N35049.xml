            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THIS little book is a part taken from SEVEN PIECES written on the <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennium,</hi> anſwering to the SEVEN <hi>Lamps of Fire burning before the</hi> THRONE OF GOD. Rev. 4.5.—And to the SEVEN <hi>Trumpets</hi> or <hi>Thunders.</hi> Rev. 10.3.—As likewiſe unto the SEVEN <hi>Spirits of God.</hi> Rev. 1.4.—The former SEVENS denoting the higheſt perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or outgoing of JUSTICE. with a double force unto mankind—the latter SEVEN de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noting the greateſt depth of divine MER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CY and GRACE to all who yield to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent call; as opening a new ſcene to them within the goſpel diſpenſation, where JUS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TICE and MERCY diſplay a renewal of ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, each acting ſo far, or as high, as hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man beings may bear, without being borne down, or carried away therewith, beyond that balance of perſonal freedom which man is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:045865_0004_10207397962576D0"/>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed truths, or in oppoſing them. At this <hi>criſis,</hi> (which is a momentous period,) each intelligent being, whether in the viſible or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible worlds, muſt ſhew to be on one ſide or the other, JUSTICE or MERCY then mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring accordingly—not only meeting him as upon his own grounds, <hi>i. e.</hi> on that which he in his own freedom gives, but as carrying him forward, in which ever of theſe lines (for or againſt this cauſe) that he willingly runs.</p>
            <p>THE ſubſtance of this book is in itſelf a twofold diſplay of TRUTH, in the way of JUSTICE and MERCY—and as belonging to the ſaid SEVEN PIECES, which take their date from <hi>anno domini</hi> 1783, opens the moſt awful and glorious REVOLUTIONS to the world—turning round now as it were upon their own centre, viz. the power of God, who confines himſelf to his foreknown periodical times, never deviating therefrom in any of his important deſigns or firſt eternal plan.</p>
            <p>IT was <hi>at the fulneſs of time,</hi> or centre of the world's duration, that <hi>God ſent his ſon.</hi>
               <pb n="v" facs="unknown:045865_0005_102073D61D1B6698"/>Gal. 4.4.—The very period of his coming was to ſignify him to the world as its ETERNAL CENTRE, and the only balancer of <hi>time,</hi> as well as the diſpoſer of it—And as he had an appointed <hi>time,</hi> viz. his FIRST COMING, in which he divided the whole duration of this world into two parts, ſo has he an appointed <hi>time,</hi> or SECOND COMING, within his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral goſpel, (<hi>i. e.</hi> in renewing its ſpiritual power, to extend out unto and gather in all people,) called the <hi>Millennium</hi>—at the promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of which, (even this preſent day,) the whole duration of the goſpel is divided into two parts—And as great <hi>revolutions</hi> were the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his firſt coming, ſo will the like now attend upon this his SECOND COMING to reclaim the world, <hi>church</hi> and <hi>ſtates, i. e.</hi> all orders and degrees of men, and bring them to a knowledge of himſelf and his divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments.</p>
            <p>As there were to be two <hi>covenants</hi> for the full completion of the whole deſigns of the GOD-HEAD, reſpecting man in the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond</hi> ſtate of probation in this creation, ſo
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:045865_0006_1020739A77044A20"/>were there to be two great ERAS of time that ſhould complete the whole duration of this cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation—And as the <hi>firſt</hi> ERA, from the creation to the coming of Chriſt, was divided into two parts, by the opening of a new ſcene in the days of <hi>Noah</hi>—ſo the <hi>ſecond</hi> ERA of the world's du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, viz. from the FIRST COMING of Chriſt to the end, is divided into two parts by a SECOND COMING, which opens this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ERA that completes the duration of the goſpel—the eternal God never leaving himſelf, in any order of his appointments, without a double witneſs; nor could the ends <hi>foreordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> by <hi>Him</hi> be completely anſwered, but in this exactneſs of order, nor otherwiſe proceed from the GOD OF ORDER, <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>mercy,</hi> having thereby renewing and interchanging ſcenes that fully anſwer his eternal purpoſe—particularly this latter period, in which both theſe attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes put forth their joint power, as it were to the higheſt, in <hi>firſt,</hi> CONVICTING and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all as guilty before God. <hi>Secondly,</hi> in <hi>converting</hi> or changing all (which in the courſe of a <hi>little time</hi> will be the caſe,) to a moſt righteous life, and which righteous ſpirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:045865_0007_102073D7A4E56B58"/>in reforming the orders of human govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, caſting off (through the inſtrumentality of its inſtruments, who work therewith,) all that iniquity, whether of church or ſtates, that held the people as ſlaves unto it.</p>
            <p>As the whole body of the JEWS has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto ſtood afar off, oppoſite the goſpel king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> therefore this CALL goes out in juſtice to them firſt, becauſe being the <hi>beloved for the Father's ſake,</hi> in order that <hi>they,</hi> with all men, whether <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> may be brought near, to hear diſtinctly, and alſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive, what this new thing is that God performs. Nor could any thing leſs than AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIGHTY POWER open out and bring for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a new and general change in things, by the removing of thoſe which have been ſo long and ſecurely eſtabliſhed on the earth; and that this is a ſcene perfectly new, the very grounds that it opens on do ſhew, giving ſuch <hi>light</hi> upon theſe main heads as never appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore—and its conſiſtency with ſcripture, and refined reaſon, evidences that it is of God.— And if he has now fully concerned himſelf, not

            <p>AS there is natural light, as well as darkneſs, two ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oppoſites—ſo is there ſpiritual light and ſpiritual darkneſs, truth and error, which are ever oppoſing each other; the one flowing from God, as the fountain of light and truth, the other ſpreading out from the devil, as the centre of dark wickedneſs, being the father of all ſophiſm and lies.</p>
            <p>GOD has witneſſes of truth in all circles of the creation.— each according to order or appointment, bearing teſtimony to his outgoing and incoming, reſpecting the various diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations or diſplayings of his truth, or true ſpirit, as well as providence. So ſatan alſo has inſtruments of error or falſehood, who, in the ſpirit of darkneſs, run in direct oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to God's holy light, let the outgoing of its power and teſtimony be what it will.</p>
            <p>THE firſt intelligent witneſs of God's pureſt truth and power placed on this earth, was Adam, who in his perſonal office was a prophet, a prieſt, and a king, as the true figure of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> that was afterwards to come in theſe charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to redeem the world—who, upon his coming, ſhould of neceſſity open out a new diſpenſation, or change of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, by his goſpel, anſwerable to the ſecond <hi>covenant</hi>—the
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:045865_0010_102073A0136C9860"/>conditions of which, in the moſt true or perfect ſenſe, as well as benefits, were reſerved for this goſpel's promulgation—as ſtanding upon, or riſing out from, its true head, viz. the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> born into the world—for before he appeared in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the fulneſs of the ſecond covenant, as belonging to him, and in which he encircled human nature, never could be manifeſted—which covenant was to be revealed to men, and from the firſt eſtabliſhing of that covenant, at the time of Adam's fall or promiſe being made, up to the very centre of time that he was to come, in every renewal or the opening out of each new circle of divine light and truth, ſtill pointed unto him, as alſo to the manner of his coming, as well as to the period of time, giving the very ſigns and marks that ſhould go before, attend and follow.—All the prophets, as one continued chain of living witneſſes linked after each other—as in a twofold row, giving from the ſpirit of God's own mouth a double teſtimony, (every eminent prophet having a cotemporary;) the angels of heaven bore witneſs alſo, upon every occaſion, giving a diſtinct and yet joint teſtimony with all the prophets and wiſe men, infolding their double teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony into theirs, making the whole then as a <hi>threefold cord that could not be broken</hi>—and thus it ran from Adam to the birth of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> at which point of time a hoſt from Heaven appeared to ſeveral living witneſſes, teſtifying his birth into this world—theſe witneſſes ſeeing <hi>him</hi> alſo with their eyes.—</p>
            <p>NOR was it at hand, but alſo afar off, that his birth was known—for God's ſpirit clearly revealed the very time of it to the eaſtern philoſophers; and his ſtar in the elements bore witneſs thereto, which they followed, travelling to the place to which his providence led them, till they both beheld and handled him.</p>
            <p>SIMEON the prophet, and <hi>Anne</hi> the propheteſs, bore wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to him in the temple, and when an infant, embraced him as the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>—his divine wiſdom (when he was but twelve years old) bore witneſs of him before all the learned doctors

            <p>IT was impoſſible for John to be a ſalſe witneſs herein, becauſe if ſo, all the prophets muſt be liars, who exactly agree with him in pointing out the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to the world; and if theſe could not be liars, how much leſs could God the father—and when he ſaid Jeſus was his <hi>only</hi> begotten ſon,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:045865_0012_102073A414F81A60"/>would not he be a liar if that he was not his ſon—and this of Jeſus being the true ſon of God, was declared in the hearing of other witneſſes, upon another occaſion, by the audible voice of God himſelf, ſpeaking from Heaven, who ſaw with their bodily eyes his divine glory ſhining through the vail of his fleſh, even too glorious to be looked upon, how much leſs then to be deſcribed.</p>
            <p>IF Jeſus of Nazareth was not the true Meſſiah, the Holy Ghoſt muſt be a deceiver—not only at his birth, baptiſm and transfiguration, but during the whole courſe of his life, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly that of his public miniſtry, and that not only through the means of his words, (truth itſelf ſays, <hi>no man ever ſpake like him,</hi>) but alſo through the works which he did, for no man ever before did the like—no, nor ſince, even in any ſort of compariſon, ſave by his power or divine appointment to peculiar perſons choſen to work wonderouſly in his name—and the many glorious works his ſervants have wrought by his power with them, yet never equal to his, in intrinſic value.—Devils became not only ſubject to his power, but trembled and fled at the very found of his name when expreſſed by others—acknowledging him to be the true Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, and holy one of God; and men who deny him to be that perſon, and reſiſt ſelf conviction, act even worſe than does Satan, which ſully proves that there are many embodied ſpirits on earth, more diſingenuous than ſome diſembodied fiends in bell.</p>
            <p>TO the JEWS were committed, not only the revealed law, and divine ordinances, but the living prophets of God, as the moſt lively images of his ſon, raiſed up in regular courſe from time to time amongſt them—and though often diſapproving of their teſtimony, yet they were never in point of truth able to contradict them.—All theſe prophets in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, one after the other, were moſt inhumanly murdered for teſtifying againſt the vice of theſe people. So the very heads of this nation, or in other words the reigning ſpirit of that whole body, roſe ſtill from one generation to another to
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:045865_0013_102073E03B5C1350"/>be as wicked comparatively as the powers of the infernal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. The JEWS do not deny but they put the holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets to death, and yet cannot ſay that they ſlew them for their wickedneſs; and as the laſt of the ancient Prophets, or <hi>head</hi> of all, the Father of Heaven, <hi>ſent them down his only begotten Son</hi> to turn them from the error of dark wickedneſs unto the trueſt light or holy knowledge of himſelf. His di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine precepts, both in their deep purity and power, fully proved him to be the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> his miraculous works on others, as well as the miraculous events that ſtill attended him, proved him altogether ſo ſupernatural, that they had no way under heaven to deny him, but by alleging all this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabundant goodneſs, or ſupernatural power, as coming wholly from Belzebub within him.—O! deluded nation, when did the Devil become ſuch a benefactor to men? It is well known that <hi>Jeſus</hi> diſcovered his power of giving life unto thoſe who were totally dead, and brought the ſouls of ſome, back again, into their bodies, after being long in the inviſible world; of this there were different inſtances, viz. raiſing a dead perſon to life, whoſe corpſe was ſtretched and laid out—a ſecond, who was carried on a bier, to be buried— and a third, who lay four days in the grave. Often he open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the eyes of grown perſons who were born blind; made thoſe who were always before dumb and deaf, to hear and ſpeak; the lame or dead limbed, at his word, would leap up and walk with all natural livelineſs, the bowed down or paralytic he delivered from all ſuch infirmity, the incurable lepers cleanſed at his word—in ſhort, be gave inſtances of his almighty power in repeatedly curing diſeaſes of all kinds, on the bodies and ſouls of men, without any medicine whatever, by his touch, (nay by the diſeaſed perſon even touching his garment,) by his word, on thoſe who heard, or by his intention to thoſe who were afar off. Theſe are notorious facts, ſeen, heard and witneſſed, by an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable number of ſpectators. He fed at different times, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral thouſands, in the barren wilderneſs, having only a few ſmall loaves and two or three little fiſhes—his Diſciples taking the bread from his hands and ſtretching it unto the heads of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:045865_0014_102073A5B37D32B8"/>the ranks, as they ſat around, who found it to increaſe as they brake it then one to the other; nor was it leſſened even after they had eat of it to their full ſatisfaction, for the remaining fragments were more than was the whole bread, before be miraculouſly increaſed it to them; and while he could feed hundreds and thouſands to their full ſatisfaction, upon ever ſo trifling a morſel, yet he himſelf could live without any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural food; an inſtance of which is given in his faſting, in a wilderneſs forty days and forty nights together. Nor was it only in his own natural body he did this, but alſo enabled others, viz. <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elijah,</hi> by his ſupernatural power upon them, even hundreds of years before his coming in the fleſh, to faſt the ſame length of time, as two diſtinct types, figuring or referring to what himſelf ſhould do, when he would come. Theſe being appointed, each one in his day, a ſtriking ſign of him, as forerunning ſervants unto him who is <hi>Lord of all.</hi> It was his divine power that raiſed up and preſerved the holy fathers, who all lived according to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment <hi>with a ſingle eye to him;</hi> it was <hi>he</hi> who brought all Iſrael, with a high hand, up out of Egypt; (yet afterwards murdered him as touching his human perſon,) led them on dry ground, through the red Sea; overthrew their enemies; bore with their diſobedience, in the wilderneſs, forty years; fed and nouriſhed them all that time in a ſupernatural man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, bringing them into the poſſeſſion of a land flowing with milk and honey.</p>
            <p>BEING the ſecond in the divine plurality, and in point of unity—God of the whole creation. He was therefore in his own perſon, above all creatures: Every thing that he created ſhould in its own order or place ſerve his holy deſign; even in his human perſon he could walk over or upon the ſeas, when his way was to paſs thereon, without the help of any natural means whatſoever, and gave a viſible inſtance therein of his divine power; and not only doing it himſelf, but by his word, could appoint any other to do the ſame.—He could tranſport himſelf, in leſs than a moment, to any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and not himſelf alone, but cauſe any number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:045865_0015_102073E3145B8C40"/>or natural bodies, to be inſenſibly moved to ever ſo great a diſtance, as in a moment; of which there was art in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance—witneſs the ſhip and crew of Diſciples, who found themſelves on the intended ſhore without ever ſailing their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary courſe—he being found with them the other ſide of the ſea, to the miraculous aſtoniſhment of numbers of Jews, who knew him to be on this ſide, the very night before; and that there was no ſhip or boat of any kind there, for his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. Now this was a notorious fact, known to thouſands; and yet he never acted upon caprice or whimſical fancy, but upon grounds altogether neceſſary to make known his divine power, without moving out of the ſtraight line of providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial occurrences, for it was upon whatever offered, or provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentially occurred, that he always acted like a God of truth and order, without doing violence to any of his creatures, reſpecting <hi>time, thing, place</hi> or <hi>perſon,</hi> for all created nature, ſhould give way, and each order yield a compliance to ſerve as well as to prove or bear teſtimony as he paſſed in courſe through this creation, that he alone is GOD, <hi>

Two were ſtruck dead on Saint Peter's ſentence againſt them, at the one time, and for the one offence; two were devoted and both together made over to Satan, under the one ſentence of Saint PAUL: theſe two men of God acting through the power of Chriſt Jeſus, and even where a judgment is executed on a ſingle perſon, it is generally in a double or twofold nature—<hi>Elymas the ſorcerer,</hi> was ſtruck with dimneſs within, and ſtone blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs without—The angel of the Lord ſmote king Herod in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and worms or lice then began outwardly to eat him alive, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>NUMEROUS inſtances of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> ALMIGHTY power, might be mentioned, ſhining forth even through the moſt ſimple things in nature, which all the powers of Earth and Hell would fall totally ſhort of ever effecting. His perſonal actions, as well as what he wrought through his Apoſtles, proved beyond all contradiction that he was the true <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> unlimitted in wiſdom, ſpiritual preſence and power di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine. For not only in the days of his ſojourning here in a human body, were the Devils ſubject unto him, but by his holy ſpirit in all his ſervants from the beginning, has he fully made known, on every neceſſary occaſion, his power over the ſpirit of darkneſs—and alſo ever ſince the days of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation has his divine power, in all his faithful witneſſes, or true miniſters of his holy goſpel, been diſplayed, <hi>i. e.</hi> upon every appointed occaſion in which he deſigned to honour himſelf in the eyes of the world, and exalt his truth above the power of error: yet, as it was his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſign to redeem the world, <hi>and tha without ſhedding of his blood, there could be no remiſſion of ſin,</hi> did he, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſuffer himſelf to be murdered—If he did not give his life a ranſom, and thus ſuffer himſelf to be ſlain, by the inſtruments of iniquity, there could be no redemption for man; yet his having power in himſelf firſt <hi>to lay it down,</hi> and ſecondly <hi>to take it again,</hi> fully proved him to be that
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:045865_0018_102073ABB0A98500"/>
               <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> who in his own wiſdom and divine power as God, redeemed his creation by laying down that life; and though all this his goodneſs unto men was foreordained, and the manner of accompliſhing it the wiſe reſult of his own mind— yet thoſe who murdered him, though acting even in the very courſe that forwarded God's foreordained purpoſe, were therein committing the greateſt wickedneſs. His goodneſs in dying for the world, was not the leaſt ſhare of goodneſs in thoſe who killed him, becauſe he and they were of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſpirits; and his ſuffering himſelf to be ſold, betrayed, falſely accuſed, to be condemned, taunted, derided, ſcoffed, ſpit upon, beaten, wounded, torn, pierced and wrecked, when hung up a ſpectacle between Heaven and Earth, to fully accompliſh the whole circle of his eternal deſign; as alſo what had been recorded of him, in the ſcripture of truth, fully proved him to be the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> who was <hi>to bear in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the iniquities of all men; the chaſtiſements juſtly due to all being laid upon him, that by his ſtripes they might be healed;</hi> and having run (as to his manhood) a courſe of ſuffering, was in length worn out, and his life thus <hi>by wicked hands, taken from him,</hi> for he ſhould <hi>be led as a lamb to the ſlaughter,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own eternal purpoſe, as well as ſcripture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy. All truths that in anywiſe related hereto, as well as viſible demonſtration, meeting in the one point, or perſon of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> evidenced him to be the ſon of God: Nor was it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that any one inferior to that <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> could lay down his life for theſe his bitter enemies, purchaſing the love of God for his murderers, by the pouring out of that blood which they were ſpilling, and the free pardon of Heaven for every ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, who would believe in his goodneſs, and yield to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of his grace, which ſtrove then with his murderers, and continues to ſtrive for a certain period, to reclaim all, men, even the moſt abandoned ſinners; and if laying down his very life for his enemies, evidenced him to be that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, how much more does his riſing from the dead, in which be takes that life into him again. The angels who attended his coming forth from the tomb, in the very order of their waiting upon him, evidence him to be the Son of God; the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:045865_0019_102073E76A3BDBF0"/>guards who were placed to watch him there, trembled and became as dead men, at the ſight of his glorious attendants; and upon recovering themſelves to be able to retreat, were found then in the city, as ſo many living witneſſes of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, till threatened by their rulers, and alſo bribed by them, to ſay that he was ſtolen away by his Diſciples, while theſe guards were aſleep, though watching him. When he was riſen from the dead, they could not ſay he was then in the tomb, and yet by ſhutting it up and keeping it ſo, they could better paſs the cheat upon the world, than by ſuch an ill framed lie, that had not even the ſmalleſt probability: They were broad awake, and yet they could not hinder him from riſing! If aſleep, how could they perceive his Diſciples taking him away? Nor was it poſſible that the Son of the living God, <hi>who is Lord of life and glory,</hi> could be holden down by the chains of death; or that all the lying inventions of Devils and Men could for ever deceive the world in the diſbelief of his reſurrection; for God has both ways and means to make himſelf and his truths manifeſt where he will, and whenever he pleaſes. Although he ſuffers thoſe who, for a juſt puniſhment of their ſins, are given over to the blindneſs of their own perverſe hearts, or deluſions of the Devil, to believe lies and harden themſelves in falſehood, his viſible aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion to glory, before a croud of living witneſſes, evidenced him to be the ſon of God, ſeated for ever, at the right hand of power, having, with the eternal Father, the whole govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all worlds. His ſending down the Holy Ghoſt, even viſibly on his Diſciples, evidences him to be the living God, <hi>one with the Father,</hi> and the ſupernatural power that was publicly known to remain with them, proved to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, that through him they poſſeſſed the Holy Ghoſt —enabling them inſtantaneouſly to ſpeak all kinds of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages—cure all manner of diſeaſes without any fort of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, by their word, or by their ſhadow, and even by handkerchiefs or aprons only touching one of theſe perſons, and carried ever ſo far to the ſick, were then recovered in laying the ſame upon them—alſo their raiſing the dead to like again by his name, their caſting out Devils; converting
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:045865_0020_102073AD654E7DC8"/>of ſinners to the true love and worſhip of God; likewiſe in his name, pronouncing juſt <hi>judgments,</hi> which were viſibly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted.</p>
            <p>AND the graces of the ſame pure ſpirit that ſtill remains with all the true ſervants of God, as well as its miraculous operations, bear witneſs that Jeſus of Nazareth was the true Meſſiah, and the only <hi>advocate or mediator between God and man, and that through him alone is</hi> SALVATION. And all the doctrines of that ſpirit which have been providently preſerved hitherto, manifeſt their true light, even by ſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, and as branching cut in all their various chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels; yet never run contrary to themſelves, in countenancing ſin in the ſmalleſt degree, oppoſite the purity and upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their holy nature, making againſt ſin and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving error at all times. And they could not, in every paſt and particular, be pure and holy, if all ſprung from a falſe <hi>head</hi>—for as the fountain, ſo ſhould be the ſtreams.— Then as the goſpel of Chriſt is pure and holy, it evidences, beyond all contradiction, that Chriſt is GOD, and through him alone that fountain of light and happineſs, viz. the <hi>ſecond</hi> covenant as well as the <hi>firſt</hi> was opened to the world, and this is <hi>the true fountain for ſin and uncleanneſs,</hi> which was in that centre of time, <hi>opened in the midſt of the houſe of David;</hi> for divine purity could come from no other head but <hi>God,</hi> through the ſecond Perſon, or Son of his love, by the agency of God the Holy Ghoſt. If there was the leaſt deceit or impoſture in Jeſus of Nazareth, his goſpel ſhould be falſe and blaſphemous, and be abhorred by God the Father—but, on the contrary, it is moſt pleaſing to God, who, by his own voice from Heaven, declared Jeſus to be his Son, commanding then his diſciples (and through them all the world) <hi>to bear him.</hi> And the light that ſhines in the conſcience of every intelligent being upon Earth, bears wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the ſtrivings of his grace within them, though all do not know him by name, and do alſo juſtify the motions of that ſpirit, though they may not follow it; yet they know there has been the motion of that good ſpirit in them.—So
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:045865_0021_102073EA32B4A6E0"/>be they ſaved or be they loſt, they ſhall juſtify him, or his goſpel ſpirit, in the great day of accounts. And all that were written in the new teſtament concerning the <hi>birth, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, ſuffering, death, burial, reſurrection</hi> and <hi>aſcenſion,</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, as alſo the obtaining, through his merits, the various gifts or portions of his ſpirit for men, exactly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond with the fights the Prophets of the old teſtament got of the Meſſiah, hundreds of years before he did come.</p>
            <p>MOSES was the higheſt and grandeſt witneſs in all the old teſtament, as a <hi>lawgiver,</hi> and in that reſpect ſtood the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt related to Chriſt, whoſe figure he was—anſwering not only in office and character exactly, but alſo in all his laws, whoſe aim or end was Chriſt and his goſpel, that being as the true ſubſtance itſelf, and the outward or literal ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony of Moſes, as the ſhadow of it. And Moſes, in a clear foreſight of Chriſt, ſays of him, <hi>"a prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you like unto me."</hi> Here Moſes ſhews that himſelf was a figure of him. And the prophet Iſaiah, in one extenſive view, eyes him as man and God in one perſon, ſpeaking thus of him, <hi>"unts us a child is borw, unto us a ſon is given, and the government ſhall be upon his ſhoulders, and his name ſhall be called Wonderful, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor, the Mighty God, the Everlaſting Father, the Prince of Peace,"</hi> his names being deſcriptive of his nature. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he deſcribes the nature of his birth—<hi>"Beheld, a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin ſhall conceive and bear a ſon, and ſhall call his name Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel,"</hi> (God with us;) then the nature of his miniſtry, <hi>"preaching good tidings to the meek, proclaiming liberty to the captives, opening the eyes of the blind, unſtopping the ears of the deaf, making the lame man leap as a bort, and the tongue of the dumb to ſing."</hi> He then deſcribes him in his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>"deſpiſed and rejected of men, a man of ſorrows and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with grief, who was cut off from the land of the living, and poured out his foul unto death; he hath borne our griefs and carried our ſorrows, was wounded for our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions and braiſed for our iniquities, becauſe the Lord, or Father of Heaven, laid upon him the iniquities of us all."</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:045865_0022_102073AEF378E528"/>Alſo in patiently enduring—<hi>"he was oppreſſed and be was afflicted, and yet he opened not his mouth; be was brought as a lamb to the ſlaughter, and as a ſheep before his ſhearers is dumb, ſo opened be not his mouth."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE language of the ſpirit out of this Prophet's mouth runs all in the paſt tenſe, becauſe the ſpirit of God had all along an eye to this preſent age, or dawning of the millenni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, when there was to be a general CALL to all, (who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Chriſt in the firſt circle or era of the goſpel,) that they might look back and take a view of all this, which has been long fulfilled—although hitherto neglected by the greater part of the world, the word of God ſuiting itſelf to men in the moſt ſuitable and ſtriking manner, always falling in with the ſituation of things or courſe of his providence to which ancient ſcriptures, the whole new teſtament, exactly agrees, proving the full accompliſhment of theſe prophecies in his holy perſon. Inſtance the following harmony:</p>
            <p>THE Prophet Micah, 5 chap. 2. ver. in the old teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, foretold him to be born at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and Saint Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew and Saint Luke's goſpel, of the new teſtament, ſhews he was born there, and the inhuman maſſacre of the young infants gave cauſe for a public remembrance of that to be the very place of his birth, as alſo the time of it. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Malachi, ſpeaking the language of Chriſt's ſpirit, ſays, "<hi>behold I ſend my meſſenger,</hi> (John the baptiſt) <hi>and he ſhall prepare the way before me;</hi>" and ſo he did, for John came before him into this world, and alſo began his miniſtry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as the goſpel evidences, and the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes John in that public office, <hi>"crying in the wilderneſs, prepare ye the way of the Lord, make ſtraight a high way for our God."</hi> Now if Chriſt was not the Lord or true God, this Prophet muſt be all along a liar. And the goſpel ſhews how exactly all this was fulfilled—And the public alarm that was given by John's preaching, was well known to all the countries about Judea, for it was of him the Prophet Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi ſpeaks, where he ſays in the word of God, <hi>behold I will
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:045865_0023_102073ED155C5688"/>ſend you Elijah the Prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.</hi> So <hi>John</hi> came in that very ſpirit and alarming power of Elias, <hi>to turn the hearts of parents to their children, and children to their parents.</hi> This, the moſt unnatural rebellion, is mentioned, to ſignify how far the whole Earth was-corrupted at the time <hi>John</hi> came to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin that prepartion of bringing them back to the true fear of God, anſwering exactly to that ſituation of things, when Elijah began to reſtore the true worſhip of God, when loſt as it were from the Earth. They were not only inwardly but alſo outwardly the likeneſs of each other—Elijah was clad with a rough garment and a leathern girdle, and ſo was John —Elijah was ſupported in an uncommon manner in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, and ſo was John in an uncommon manner in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs—three years and a half was the time of Elijah's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement with the cauſe of God, and three years and a half was the courſe ſignified by Daniel's prophecy for John's mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry to continue. It was ſaid of Elijah, <hi>that he ſtood up as a fire, and that his word burned like a lamp</hi>—Eccleſ. 48, 1. And the ſon of God ſaid of John <hi>that he was a burning and a ſhining light.</hi> The one did not fear to reprove king <hi>Ahab,</hi> nor the other to reprove king Herod—the one forced to fly from Ahab's wiſe, who would have put him to death—the other put to death by the inſtigation of the wiſe of Herod.— And as Elijah was the true figure of John, ſo was John a true figure of the ſon of God, and the very nigheſt to Chriſt in preparing men for the kingdom of heaven. John baptized with water, as ſetting men cleanly apart for-God's kingdom, and Chriſt, as the only true God, baptized with the Holy Ghoſt, taking them into it. John's circle of action therein was his laſt three and a half years, and the courſe of Chriſt's public miniſtry in his body of fleſh, was his laſt three and a half years alſo. The matchableneſs of God's equptal ways ſhould be kept up, ſo the ſcriptures alſo ſhould be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, the one in courſe ſtill giving place to the other, all things going on hand in hand and conſiſtent with each other. The goſpel of the new teſtament evidently ſhews that <hi>Jeſus</hi> or <hi>Meſſeah</hi> was ſold and betrayed by his own friend or Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:045865_0024_102073B0A698D818"/>and that they pierced both his hands and his feet, nail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to the croſs; and after they hanged him up, ſtood ſtaring and looking upon him, dying thereon, and did not the Pſalmiſt, by the cleareſt foreſight hereof, in the old teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, deſcribe him in that ſituation, when he ſays of him, <hi>"mine own familiar friend, in whom I truſted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel againſt me; they piercea any hands and my feet, they ſtand ſtaring and looking upon me."</hi> Pſa. 41, 9. The treatment they gave him on the croſs Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid clearly foreſaw alſo by the ſame ſpirit of prophecy.— <hi>"All they that ſee me laugh me to ſcorn, they ſhoot out the lip and wag the head, ſaying, he truſted in God that he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him, let him deliver him if be will have him. They gave me gall to eat, and when I was thirſty they gave me vinegar to drink; they parted my garments amongſt them, and upon my veſture did they caſt lots"</hi>—Pſa. 22. How exactly was all this fulfilled, both in word and action, on the Son of God.</p>
            <p>THE goſpel of the new teſtament ſhews he was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied between two thieves, and the ſpirit of the Prophet, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of years before that, in the old teſtament, eyed him in that ſituation. See Iſa. 53, 12—<hi>"He was numbered with the tranſgreſſors."</hi> The new teſtament ſhews he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred in a rich man's tomb, and there ſurrounded by a guard of wicked men, and did not the Holy Ghoſt eye him thus when it ſpeaks by the Prophet, <hi>"that he ſhould make his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death."</hi> Iſa. 53, 9. By the goſpel of the new teſtament, his reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in every circumſtance is plainly ſhewed, to which theſe very guards of wicked men gave affirmation, as eye-win neſles of it, and their framing a lie afterwards to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry remains ſtill only a negative teſtimony to the ſame—and did not the Holy Ghoſt foreſhew his reſurrection, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

THE very truth of the new teſtament manifeſts his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion into Heaven, there being a vaſt number of living witneſſes beholding him with their eyes, going up, <hi>till the clouds received him out of their ſight,</hi> and this was only ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling what the holy ſpirit declared in the old, when, by the mouth of David, it cries, <hi>lift up your heads, O! ye gates, and be ye lift up ye everlaſting doors, and the king of glary ſhall come in</hi>—Pſa. 24, 9. This text fully ſhews that the Prophet was by no means ſpeaking of himſelf, but of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the everlaſting King of glory, who thus aſcended up to the eternal Heavens. And if God had not come down in the perſon of Chriſt, dwelling bodily in him, he could not, in the language of truth, be ſaid to aſcend up, to take his glory above. The ſame Prophet Tpeaks of him as having actually gone up in triumph, where he ſays, "<hi>thou art gone up on high, thou haſt led captivity captive, and received gifts for men,</hi> not for himſelf; and to this the new teſtament bears witneſs by the miraculous power of theſe ſpiritual gifts, which men received, as do alſo the doctrines of grace and purity, in or upon thoſe who truly obey the goſpel of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and all being thus, as in the laſt ſentence, brought home to a point, into the very centre of man's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward feeling, he muſt know theſe things to be true, and before ever his conſcience can be brought to diſcredit any of theſe fundamental truths, reſpecting the incarnation of the Son of God, and full redemption of mankind through him, he muſt be firſt perſuaded that he has no lively feeling nor exiſtence, and that never could be, becauſe while he is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of knowledge he has both life and feeling. So ſtrong, concluſive, and ſelf evident, has God made the clear light of his goſpel truth upon the ſouls of all men, that no man can periſh, but in wilfully perſiſting in ſin, ever againſt the true light of the goſpel ſpirit that ſhines unto him, and appears within him, knowing himſelf to be oppoſing God's ſaving truth, and alſo perverting his own underſtanding.</p>
            <p>THE harmony that is between the old and the new teſtaments is worthy the admiration of angels; how much
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:045865_0026_102073B78DCBA590"/>more the admiration of men, for whoſe ſake the whole was accompliſhed—not by a mean perſon—not by a created an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel; no, but by the ETERNAL JEHOVAH. O! man, how highly favoured.</p>
            <p>ALL the ſcriptures of the old teſtament that related to the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> were in the only full or trueſt ſenſe accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> at the very head of the goſpel, as failing all within the circle of the chriſtian diſpenſation, into which theſe prophecies ſhould launch, and by no other perſon, nor at any other point of time, could theſe ſcriptures be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, elſe all prophecy is falſe. And not barely through the words of a Prophet, but from the very mouth of an <hi>Arch-Angel</hi> of the firſt Heavenly order, was conveyed to <hi>Daniel,</hi> and through him to all men, the very <hi>time</hi> that the Meſſiah ſhould come, and be alſo cut off for his people; and where all this has been fulfilled, even to the laſt exactneſs, taking in all theſe prophecies within that point of time, and in that very perſon, agreeable to the report of that <hi>Angel,</hi> it does not leave even the ſmalleſt room for people to conceit any thing to the contrary.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Angel</hi> ſaid to <hi>Daniel, "ſeventy weeks are determined upon thy people, and upon thy holy city, to finiſh the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and to make an end of ſins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlaſting righteouſneſs, and ſeal up the viſion and prophecy, and to anoint the moſt holy,"</hi> even Jeſus Chriſt, who is the moſt holy God; or that Angel is a liar. Here this Angel delivers the whole circle or courſe of the time, counting a day for a year, in which all theſe things in their full or trueſt heads were to be accompliſhed. He then divides that circle of ſeventy weeks (or 490 years) into three diſtinct periods, viz. <hi>ſeven weeks—ſixty-two weeks—and one week,</hi> and fully explains what ſhould be accompliſhed in each of theſe diſtinctly, one after the other, to the fulfilment of the whole 490 years, counting from the ſeventh year of the reign of Artaxerxes, in which a commandment was to go forth from God, through the mouth of that King, unto
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:045865_0027_102073F335C3CF28"/>
               <hi>Ezra,</hi> to reſtore and build again the walls and city of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, which was completed by Nehemiah in the firſt ſeven weeks period of forty-nine years, reckoning from the date of that command. Juſt at the cloſe of <hi>three ſcore and two weeks,</hi> or 434 years after, which was the ſecond period, making in all 483 years, <hi>John</hi> came preaching in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, the 26th year of Chriſt; then there remained but the third period, viz. <hi>one week,</hi> or ſeven years of the whole 490; and this one week was particularly ſingled out, and chiefly pointed at by the Angel as the crowning of all; for the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah could not be cut off, within the ſecond period, nor until the cloſe of the third, for he ſaid, "<hi>and after</hi> (not before) <hi>three ſcore and two weeks,</hi> from the finiſhing of Jeruſalem, <hi>ſhall Meſſiah be cut off,</hi>" viz. at the cloſe of the laſt week, and then a particular account follows of what was to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed by the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and his forerunner theſe ſeven years, allowing three and a half years to each, to wit: "<hi>He ſhall confirm the covenant</hi> (of the goſpel light) <hi>with many for one week,</hi> (even as many as did receive it,) <hi>and in the midſt of the week,</hi> (namely, when Chriſt began to preach)—<hi>he ſhall cauſe the ſacrifice and oblation to ceaſe,</hi> (Jewiſh ceremonies never more to be accounted the true worſhip of God,) <hi>and for the overſpreading of abominations, he ſhall make it deſolate, even until the conſummation of the whole; and that determined ſhall be poured upon the deſolate</hi>"—And has not all this been known to be exactly and fully accompliſhed, before the face of the world?</p>
            <p>THE prophetic accounts of the Meſſiah's actions, ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and death, are ſo wonderfully minute and exact, that they look altogether more like a hiſtory than prophecies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling more a copy drawn from the events, than a predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them; and yet theſe prophecies were written ſeveral hundred years before his coming; and as an additional evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in ſavour of theſe ſcriptures, they were in the keeping of the enemies of the goſpel, who hated and deſpiſed <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and at that foreknown point of time crucified him—being at once both the preſervers and accompliſhers of the very
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:045865_0028_102073B9177F4628"/>prophecies, which their own wilful blindneſs would not let them ſee fulfilled, and God juſtly gave them up thereto.</p>
            <p>IN the firſt grand and extended view, this <hi>Angel</hi> (who converſed with <hi>Daniel</hi>) gathers up all as into one head, in which he ſhews the full atonement to be made for the ſins of the whole world, viz. <hi>"to finiſh tranſgreſſion, to make an end of ſins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlaſting righteouſneſs, and to ſeal up the viſion"</hi> of all the prophecies of the old teſtament concerning the Meſſiah, being all directed to this as their central point. He then, as within this one great head, or upon the grounds of it, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularizes every thing neceſſary, whereby the fulfilment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of might be clearly known, from his foregoing deſcription, including alſo within theſe ſeventy weeks the removal of the ſceptre from Judah, and after the end of that ſpace of time how the Romans were to deſtroy Jeruſalem, as alſo the deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating miſery, or long ſcene of misfortunes, that were to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that nation for wickedly rejecting their <hi>Meſſiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN this one revelation to Daniel, was determined firſt, the very point of time, that Chriſt was to be born into this world, ſecondly, the exact time, he was to enter into his miniſtry, and thirdly, the inſtant of time, he was to be cut off for the ſins or his people, and may be well termed one of the nobleſt prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in all the old teſtament, this intelligence not being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to the Prophet in the ordinary line, but the moſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, and in that ſenſe riſes to the higheſt head of cleareſt knowledge, receiving it all from the very mouth of the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angel,</hi> whom he beheld face to face, and with whom he freely converſed; and that great <hi>Angel</hi> always addreſſed Daniel as a man mightily beloved of God for his great piety and truth, which love to him was made manifeſt, where God changed the very nature of the lions, ſo that, inſtead of deſtroying him, as was deſigned, they fawned upon him, when he was caſt down into their <hi>den;</hi> and that his light far exceeded all the Prophets in diſcerning particular periods in which the moſt extraordinary events were to happen, and giving an account
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:045865_0029_102073F4D80830F0"/>of the number of years that <hi>reached</hi> to each, is <hi>very</hi> evident as alſo the amazing extent of his views, and ſo far as things have had time to come about, or follow in courſe, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies have been ſo far fulfilled to the niceſt exactneſs; and in point of freedom with the Almighty he ſtands not a whit below any man, but was, in this reſpect, a ſtriking figure or type of Chriſt; he converſed freely with God himſelf in the perſon of the <hi>Angel of the covenant,</hi> afterwards manifeſted in the fleſh as the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and that <hi>Meſſiah</hi> has named him <hi>Daniel the Prophet,</hi> and the Holy Ghoſt has ſignified him, in Zek. 14, 20, to be one of the greateſt worth in the ſight of God. If Daniel was liable to err in his judgment, yet the <hi>Arch Angel</hi> could not err in his commiſſion; and how much leſs could the <hi>Angel of the covenant,</hi> or God himſelf, who confirmed theſe truths unto him, and when all the Prophets bear witneſs hereto, in the moſt exact harmony, and that the fulfilment of all has been truly accompliſhed before the face of the world, there cannot then be the leaſt room left for any error in all theſe accounts of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and his goſpel kingdom, neither can the truth of thoſe which have been long ſince fulfilled be now diſputed, for thoſe propheſies which are now fulfilling evidences the truth of thoſe which have been already fulfilled. Daniel's prophecies are this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment fulfilling, and ſo are all the extended prophecies of the old teſtament which reached into this goſpel era, where men now ſtand, for the goſpel <hi>time</hi> now ſurrounds all, being come to its middle <hi>point,</hi> in which there muſt be a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral change or turning round, and unto which the whole old teſtament does lend its ſtrength to aſſiſt that change— ſtanding no longer, as it were, upon its own legs or old grounds, but as uniting with that is entirely new, and ſhall bring forth a new ſcene in its preſent revolution throughout the world, turning about as it were upon its own centre, yet this ſtrength, or ſtrong revolve of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, is not upon any thing old, but upon that which is now, in its preſent motion. Though the old teſtament was written long before the new, to which is bears a forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning witneſs, yet the new teſtament fully proves itſelf to
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:045865_0030_102073BADC7B0BD0"/>be diving, without a dependence on the old for that proof. The old teſtament, conſidered altogether in itſelf, is but one witneſs—and in the nature of things there could not but be a ſecond in that order—for God would not leave himſelf without a ſecond witneſs therein. And that the goſpel diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation has ſufficiently proved itſelf, may be now fully known from all the true grounds already opened in the circular courſes of its twofold order, exactly correſpondent to that foreknowledge, which at its firſt head was diſplayed by nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous predictions—and the full completion of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions not only prove the goſpel true, but alſo manifeſts its divine independence to any thing elſe for that proof. The prophecies of the new teſtament, correſponding exactly with the occurrencies of theſe ſeventeen or eighteen hundred years paſt, plainly diſcovers that this goſpel of the new teſtament is divine, and totally independent to the old teſtament for any ſupport, which proves its head <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> to be GOD, and alſo ſhews, that all the revolutions on the whole face of this creation ſince the commencement of the goſpel <hi>era,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon it, as lying in, and proceeding from, the womb of God, whoſe providential power over-ruleth all things; and through the <hi>wiſdom, mercy</hi> and <hi>juſtlce,</hi> of the goſpel, is his preſence diſplayed, the true picture of which in matter and miniature, was his veil of fleſh; nor is there any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or huding him out, but as in the truth of that goſpel, for through this alone be diſplays his attributes; firſt, in the light of his <hi>ſpirit;</hi> ſecondly, through the doctrines and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the ſcripture <hi>word;</hi> and thirdly, the revolving and wondrous occurrences of <hi>Providence;</hi> and it is through theſe that men can ſee him, and through which, in all the depths of divine wiſdom, he miniſters both <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>juſtice</hi> to all pations, as well as individuals. Not even a devil in hell can with any face, ſay, but there have many things occurred in this world theſe eighteen hundred years paſt, and that all theſe momentous things have been conſiſtent with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of the new teſtament, is what the powers of darkneſs cannot deny—Therefore all that has occurred throughout the whole world theſe eighteen hundred years, is one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued

Therefore, ſhallow, light and empty, muſt thoſe be, though their number be ever ſo great, who ſet up themſelves againſt divine wiſdom, or that weight of God's fulneſs; and where the whole force of Heaven and Earth, in a bulk of eighteen hundred years occurrences, (not to mention more,) come againſt ſuch, what can be their wiſdom and ſtrength, in compariſon?

God himſelf is the preſent God, not a paſt one; his higheſt work, which is moſt to be thought of, is his preſent work, and not that which is paſt; it is what is doing this moment that bas his greateſt engagement, and it is what he is engaged moſt in, that is to be the greateſt concern of men and angels; then his chief concernat this preſent, is to bring all men back un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, or his true ſpiritual worſhip, through a new diſpenſed power of light and truth, which is now to extend to all, in order to gain them, even on the grounds of their own free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; therefore this is what every intelligent creature is now to eye or attend.</p>
            <p>ALL the former outgoings of truth, in the line of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have had a tendency to this preſent outgoing; and this, as the laſt and higheſt, being the upper head or middle point of the goſpel duration, gathers in all the former; therefore the preſent is the mean point, in which <hi>God, Angels</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> are concerned, and alſo that againſt which all the infernal powers are engaged, and not againſt any ſcene that is paſt; what is paſt and gone, is paſt and gone, but now ſets in a ſeens that is perfectly new, (though the likeneſs has been in ages paſt) and as to its foundation riſe, ſtands entirely upon its own centre, the eternal, 1 AM; without a dependence for its ſupport upon any former ſcene, or upon him <hi>who was;</hi> for the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> or great deliverer comes out now anew, in his ſplendid power, the ſame as if he had never come before, yet fully illuſtrated, and witneſſed by his former coming; not as oppoſite to his firſt coming, but conſiſtent with it, having all the light and ſtrength of his firſt coming bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to this his ſecond; yet the former grounds are not it, inviſible ſupport, no more than its direct circle of action, for the ſtrength of this comes anew down <hi>from above,</hi> and all
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:045865_0033_102073FD6B4AAFF8"/>the former truths manifeſted even from the beginning of the world, are but illuſtrations to it, backing and confirming it. This new ſcene ſtands upon its own true <hi>baſe,</hi> even the <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal independent,</hi> under no obligation for the aid of any thing that is paſt to hold him up, and yet, before this can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted or reverſed, all the truths from the beginning that have been even already openly fulfilled before the face of the world, muſt be proved falſe, which could not be done by all the powers in Heaven, Earth or Hell; and even in caſe the truth of any former ſcene was never called in queſtion, nor a portion of ancient ſcripture alleged, as a proof in all this, yet God would make his preſent cauſe ſtand in itſelf ſtrong againſt every oppoſition, though adverſaries, in all the power and ſubtilty of Satan, were to twiſt about even the whole letter of ſcripture againſt it, yet it would be but a dead word againſt this living power, or moving of God upon the face of the world, and in which motion all men find their hearts moved for ſomething great, which they term <hi>freedom.</hi> There are no bounds to be ſet by men or angels to the free liberty of God, who has his own way and time for all things, and Chriſt is this God. The incontenſtible proofs of his god-head could never be delivered in full, for they would not only be beyond all number, but they run as long as <hi>eternity,</hi> and as wide as <hi>immenſity,</hi> ſo that not only a book, but this whole world could not contain all the proofs of it. <hi>Himſelf,</hi> who contains all worlds, ſays he is <hi>one with the Father,</hi> and commands men <hi>to worſhip him eveil as they worſhip the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> and the Father of glory ſpeaks down out of Heaven, and deſires all men <hi>to hear and obey him;</hi> and God the Holy Ghoſt does openly appear, as a diſtinct attendant upon him, or as <hi>one</hi> with him in point of inſeparable union, obeying his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or working together by the word of his own power, to bring all men to that faith and obedience of him.</p>
            <p>IT is through God that <hi>men live, move, and have their being,</hi> as well as freedom of power either in ordinary or extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry things; and this power is through Chriſt as God, <hi>for he treated all things, and by him all things now ſubſiſt;</hi> and he

It is only God himſelf could ſave a loſt world, and all the angels in Heaven teſtify that <hi>he is the Saviour of all.</hi> All the created elements ſtooped to him as God of all, and were attendants on his beck, in either ordinary or extraordinary caſes, and all do at this day ſerve his purpoſe, and fall into the line or circle of his wiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. The powers of the damned region, ſo ſar as they have had a communion with men, openly acknowledged him to be the God of Heaven. All the Prophets and wiſe men taken together witneſs him to be God, nor was there ever a divine prophecy yet given that contradicted it, or denied him to be one with the Father, whatever alleged to the contrary, at any time, was altogether from the infernal region. The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment both of his threats and promiſes, and the general occurrences of his over-ruling providence, continually evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that he is God over all; for God the Father, God the Holy Ghoſt, Arch-Angels, Angels, Prophets, holy Men, learned Philoſophers, as well as the unlearned and ſimple, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with holy Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, as alſo an innumerable number of pious Preachers, and multitudes of righteous people, in all ages ſince, give a full and inconteſtible evidence to the divine nature and power of Jeſus Chriſt, as have at times the very infernal powers; ſo that all worlds, creatures and things, viſible and inviſible, do harmonize in this, let them appear ever ſo oppoſite in other things, leaving it out of the power of any to call this (even in any degree of probability) in queſtion, having now no ſort of grounds leſt them to act upon againſt it. If the <hi>word,</hi> which was made fleſh in the perſon of Jeſus of Nazareth, and dwelt amongſt men, was not God, as the ſecond perſon coequal and coeternal with the Father, one and all of theſe muſt be falſe witneſſes. Long before he aſſumed the fleſhly form of a man, his ſpirit
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:045865_0035_102073FEF4A47C78"/>ſays, by one of its inſtruments, "<hi>behold I will ſend Elijah the Prophet,</hi> (viz John, who acted as Elijah,) <hi>before the coming of the great and awful day of the Lord, and be ſhall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to the ſpirit of the holy fathers, leſt I come and ſmite the Earth with a curſe.</hi>" The hearts of the children have been turned to the true ſpirit of the fathers, and parents to a pious regard for their children, ſo far as they embraced and obeyed John's doctrine, who was the immediate forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the Lord of that great and awful day, or goſpel ſcene; and all thoſe who ſlighted that reclaiming doctrine of John, and diſregarded his warning, particularly that nation to which he was immediately ſent, ſell under that curſe, to the utter deſtruction of their <hi>temple, city</hi> and <hi>ſelves;</hi> for, at the firſt head, or higheſt outgoing of its power, it ſwept the chief part of them away <hi>with the beſom of deſtruction,</hi> and has, though in a lighter ſenſe, been purſuing a puniſhment upon their children, from generation to generation, above 1700 years, their native land, all that time lying under the eſſects or that curſe.</p>
            <p>ALL the foregoing truths that bear witneſs to Chriſt's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power as God, do alſo witneſs that he has long ago come in the fleſh; for if he has not come in the fleſh, the whole of what has been ſaid is falſe, and if falſe, all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are liars, and if liars, the whole grounds upon which <hi>Judaiſm</hi> was founded, as well as that upon which <hi>Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> is founded, is erroneous, and of the devil. But chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is founded upon GOD, and if Chriſt is not GOD, the wiſeſt and holieſt men that ever were in the world have been all deceived in every age, none being right or true but infidels.</p>
            <p>LET men think what they may, <hi>God is true,</hi> and delights in nothing but <hi>truth,</hi> and the Prophets who were influenced by his ſpirit muſt be true, for he had pleaſure in them, and all who hurted his faithful Prophets highly offended him, and yet hurt they would be, as he clearly foreſaw and predicted, in the ſerpent <hi>biting their heel;</hi> and even thoſe who ſlew the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:045865_0036_102073C4B95BDE50"/>prophets well knew that they were neither falſe nor wicked, for it was for bearing teſtimony againſt the errors and vices which theſe people themſelves were conſcious of, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling them the conſequence of their doings, and the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that ſhould follow, that provoked them to kill them; and as God cannot vary in the leaſt from his own truth and holineſs, neither can that prophecy which comes from his own ſpirit, vary even the ſmalleſt degree from what it abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely declares; for it is that that muſt be, and nothing elſe— and as a crowning or concluding point, even the cloſing of the patriarch Jacob's life, he in his laſt words declared by the ſpirit of God, <hi>"that the ſceptre ſhould not depart from Judah, nor a ruling lawgiver until Shiloh ſhould come"</hi>—So the <hi>temple, city,</hi> or Jewiſh polity, never could be deſtroyed until after the coming of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and theſe have been deſtroyed above 1700 years, therefore it is above that long ſince he did come in bodily perſon.</p>
            <p>ALL prophecies in both the new and the old teſtaments do in this agree, nor is there any one, in all the ſcriptures, againſt it, nor could there even one ſentence, from the ſpirit of truth, by any perſon whatſoever, be delivered ſince to the contrary; and Chriſt the head, as God of all the Prophets, ſhould ſuffer in his fleſh in like manner with them, for <hi>teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying that the deeds of men were evil,</hi> and pronouncing his righteous judgments againſt ſuch, which, in all particulars, anſwered to the predictions of all the forerunning Prophets, as have been verified upon them who crucified their King, even <hi>the holy one of God;</hi> and this their doing in all particulars, was juſt fulfilling the predictions of the Prophets, who, through the light of God, foreſaw they would do it; alſo the ſevere chaſtiſement that ſuch have undergone ever ſince, is but a fulfilment of the predictions of that true ſpirit; for, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on committing that evil, they were to be puniſhed, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo ſuch a courſe of affliction, as could not be one jot lighter than that decreed, nor a whit ſhorter than the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known courſe of its appointed bounds, agreeable to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of Daniel, and declarations of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as alſo of his
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:045865_0037_10207400B021D2B8"/>Prophets of the new teſtament, witneſſed particularly by his two chief or moſt extenſive ſeers, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and Saint <hi>John;</hi> and yet the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> in reſpect of the Jews deliverance, as foreſeeing the very date or day of it, ſeems to lie cloſeſt to them of all, for as living and dying within the Jewiſh Church, he was favoured with the cleareſt views of all things that were to befal the children of his people, during the rites of Moſes, and even afterwards, until they ſhould be all gathered into the chriſtian fold, under the one true ſhepherd; and therein this holy Prophet rejoiced in the cloſe of that true account delivered him by the Angel of the covenant, viz. <hi>"bleſſed is he that waiteth and cometh to the thouſand three hundred and five and thirty days,"</hi> which is forty-five days longer than the <hi>"thouſand two hundred and ninety days,"</hi> being two particular points or eras of circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating time, mentioned to this Prophet; and this waiting or patiently enduring, implies an eager longing for that <hi>little time</hi> of forty-five days to be cloſed—and the natural occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences within theſe forty-five years, it ſeems will need this patient waiting, or ſteady enduring, <hi>and bleſſed is he that cometh</hi> to the end thereof, (this was written in Europe, by the Watchman, where the great ſlaughter was to begin,) or to whatever time he is ſuffered to live, in the line of <hi>believing</hi> and holding to what this new opening or renewing diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, now in its firſt outgoing declares; acting all along conſiſtent therewith, and growing up in the divine power thereof. The leſſer circle, viz. <hi>Daniel's</hi> 1290 days, has reached to the firſt dawning of this new diſpenſation; the greater, viz. his 1335 days, reaches unto its ſetting in, in all its fulneſs of conquering power. By or through the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of theſe forty-five years, <hi>"many ſhall be purified and made white,"</hi> to enjoy the fulneſs of bleſſings that is to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed, in all civil and religious freedom, to the whole world, <hi>i. e.</hi> eſtabliſhed univerſally at the end of thoſe days, namely, at the cloſe of the 1335 days; <hi>but the wilfully wicked</hi> (if the <hi>Angel</hi> ſpoke truth to <hi>Daniel) ſhall do wickedly</hi> in the interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate time, and <hi>and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

<pb n="30" facs="unknown:045865_0038_102073C6A94A57D0"/>the alarming outgoing of the divine power through its zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous inſtruments, to overthrow the corruption and iniquity of high ſtates, and the help afforded them by the renewing light of true prophecy, which one might think would make the moſt fooliſh wiſe. <hi>But the wiſe,</hi> ſays the <hi>Angel, ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, i. e.</hi> all diſcerning <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and enlightened JEWS, who may now prepare themſelves for a return to their own land, where none ſhall be able, after this <hi>little time,</hi> to make them afraid.</p>
            <p>THEY who reckon theſe forty-five days (as that foreor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained period of purging the general floor,) from the year 1789, taking the year 1790 as the firſt of the forty-five which reaches to 1836, will hardly be miſtaken.</p>
            <p>ALL the prophecies of the peaceful ſtate of the Meſſiah kingdom, are yet, in the moſt eminent ſenſe, to be fulfilled; nor could he ever anſwer that character, <hi>Prince of Peace,</hi> if he was not to give univerſal peace on Earth, which has not yet come to paſs. It ſeems that peaceful ſtate falls into this ſecond era, or higher circle of his goſpel. It was a grand error or in thoſe who rejected the Meſſiah, to ſuppoſe that his kingdom of univerſal peace was to take place immediately on-his appearing. The prophecies of the old teſtament plainly intimate, that this proſperous ſtate of his kingdom was not only to be preceded by his ſuffering, but the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the new teſtament alſo ſhew that perſecutions, trials, and ſufferings, ſhould, in different degrees, attend his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, before the kingdoms of the earth became, by a general converſion, the kingdom of the Lord and his Chriſt. See Math. 10, 34.</p>
            <p>THE new teſtament prophecies take in, as it were, all the old, and add not only new luſtre, but extended ſtrength un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; ſo that had the JEWS believed <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> they would have believed in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and their oppoſition to <hi>him,</hi> proved they were neither of the faith or ſpirit of <hi>Moſes, Prophets,</hi> or holy <hi>Fathers,</hi> ſet theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded themſelves in every ſenſe by oppoſing the MESSI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AH, and in juſtice, God confounded them; ſor in the very line of their diſobedience, his judgment overtook them. They put the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to a ſhameful death, when all their nation were aſſembled at the celebration of the paſſover; and when aſſembled to that celebration, Titus the Roman, (as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of juſtice) ſhut them up within the walls of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem to put them to death. The rejection of the true Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah was their crime, and the following of falſe Meſſiahs was their ſore puniſhment. They ſold and bought Jeſus as a ſlave, and were afterwards ſold and bought at the loweſt price for miſerable ſlavery themſelves. They made him a companion of thieves and robbers, and they were afterwards infeſted with bands of thieves and robbers. They put their <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to death, leſt the Romans ſhould come and take away their place and nation, and in ſo doing the Romans did come, and took away their place and nation. They cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <hi>him</hi> before the walls of Jeruſalem, and before the walls <hi>themſelves</hi> were crucified, in ſuch numbers that it is ſaid room was wanted for the croſſes, and croſſes for the bodies; ſo their own imprecation, <hi>"his blood be upon us and our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,"</hi> was remarkably fulfilled; and that predicted by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> has been verified, viz. <hi>the Lord ſhall ſcatter thee among all people, from the one end of the Earth even to the other, &amp;c.</hi> Deut. 28, 64. And being now ſo many hundred years un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the effect of that prediction, fully proves that till now there has been ſome heinous crime amongſt them, for which they did not repent. The downfal of the tabernacle of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, could not be before the rejection of the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> for it was upon that ſin that God gave it wholly up, to be trodden down by the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> juſtly rejecting them who rejected his <hi>Son,</hi> and this tabernacle could not be again raiſed up, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the predictions of the Prophets, if it was not firſt broken down, nor could it be raiſed up according to all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            <p>THEIR fathers put the Meſſiah to death, not for any evil that was in <hi>him,</hi> but to ſatisfy their malice; and to the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this new ſcene, they have been of that ſame ſpirit of their fathers; ſo that the guilt, till now, has lain upon them, and of courſe the puniſhment continues, while ever there is guilt. They perſecuted him to death, merely upon their own judgment; and was not this at beſt acting upon the greateſt uncertainty? <hi>He that truſts his own heart,</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the public cry, often <hi>finds himſelf a fool;</hi> and if their hearts deceived them herein, is it any wonder that they now ſhrink at the thought, and keep as far off as poſſible from it? But though they ſhould ſtrive ever ſo much againſt it, yet it is true, and truth will break in and overpower them.</p>
            <p>HE was to come at the very time he did come, and at no other time could he come, agreeably to the Prophets. If he has not yet come, all their ancient Prophets muſt be falſe, and of courſe their manner of worſhip, founded upon their ſcriptures, were always falſe; ſo if he did not come, their preſent worſhip muſt be utterly falſe; and if he has come, their Jewiſh worſhip now is erroneous, and rejected of God, becauſe oppoſing his goſpel; ſo their preſent caſe, as to the Moſaic ceremonies, is bad on every hand; and <hi>we</hi> be unto them if he has not yet come, becauſe his coming was to be unto his own people, <hi>the ſtock of Iſrael,</hi> and him they will not receive, as their own ſcriptures affirm, <hi>but caſt him out and ſtay him, in order to keep the inheritance;</hi> ſo that, upon the grounds of their own ſuppoſision, if he is yet to come in the fleſh, they are to put him to death, and after that, there is above 1700 years of ſuch, miſery to come upon them, as
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:045865_0041_10207409335AA6F8"/>never beſel any nation. Now here is what they gain by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying that he did come; for if he was yet to come in the fleſh, all this would lie before them, as certain as God is in Heaven; but in the very nature of things that cannot be, becauſe they are that long in a courſe of ſhame and afflicting miſery—Already diſperſed, their temple and city deſtroyed, and their polity gone; ſo that he has no houſe of David now to come unto as a King, they having no particular kingdom, being broken down long ſince. Moreover, God's <hi>ſpirit, word</hi> and <hi>providence,</hi> muſt have confounded one another, and wrought all along againſt each other, to the great fruſtration or confuſtion of divine oeconomy.</p>
            <p>BUT know, O! JEW, <hi>that blindneſs in part only happened to Iſrael.</hi> TRUTH leads thee now into the light of a new <hi>myſtery,</hi> which could not be opened before this <hi>ſecond</hi> ERA of the goſpel diſcloſed it, and which fully correſponds with thy idea of expecting the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>UPON your rejecting the Son of God, you were then given up to the blindneſs of your own hearts, and upon mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering him, divine <hi>juſtice</hi> engaged itſelf againſt you; yet, during the foreordained period of your long puniſhment, you were in part ſupported, and by <hi>mercy</hi> kept diſtinct from every people, from generation to generation. Through all your calamities a remnant was ſtill preſerved. An expectation of the Meſſiah's coming, one day or other, to deliver you, has been always your hope, and this has been founded in the very depth of God's truth. But your denying that he came before, is not of God, but of that evil power that deceived your hearts. When ye rejected him, at the firſt head of his goſpel, ye could not, in point of divine juſtice, receive him, until that firſt circle, belonging to that head of its diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cloſed, but as conſiſting of two <hi>eras</hi> within itſelſ— <hi>Chriſt</hi> comes at the head of the <hi>ſecond,</hi> as well as he did at the head of the <hi>firſt,</hi> not in bodily perſon, but ſpiritual power, through which he brings all nations, kindreds and people, to acknowledge him; ſo that, in expecting the <hi>Deliverer,</hi> you
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:045865_0042_102073CEEDA5CA80"/>have been all along right; and though you had that hope, yet you could not clearly comprehend the manner of his coming, nor the nature of his kingdom, till opened out unto you, notwithſtanding your being in a meaſure united to God through grace, and reſerved until this day ſhould dawn, and its morning ſtar riſe clear before your eyes, and you receive the true evidence thereof in your own conſciences. And further, this WORD, is the firſt DIVINE CALL to you on this head; for the calls given you before this, were only from men, but now God's power ſpeaks, and ſooner than now it could not be; nor was the like from Heaven to you theſe 1700 years paſt, nor could you ſooner than this, as one great body, come into the Meſſiah's kingdom; but now you will enter therein, for this <hi>word cannot return till it accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhes that for which it is ſent;</hi> and you will know that it is from HIM, by his light ſhining upon your hearts, and by the general influence of his grace ſwaying your wills, which now is yielding thereto, as if the whole of ye were but one man.</p>
            <p>HERE is good tidings for you—and ſhall, in the courſe of a <hi>little time</hi> be matter of joy unto all nations. But then it is required of men, as Beings capable of free action, to fall in with God's deſigns, concerning them: His richeſt bleſſings are received only in the line of <hi>believing</hi> his report, <hi>i. e.</hi> yielding thereto. <hi>Without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe him,</hi> much leſs to riſe high in his favour.</p>
            <p>THOUGH you have waited now above 1700 years, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting your MESSIAH, yet ye have had no deliverance, and you ſhould wait now not only 1700, but 17000 years, were the world to laſt ſo long, and yet find no MESSIAH to deliver you, if you do not accept him in the light and truth of this ſimple <hi>word,</hi> through which he offers himſelf unto ye.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE open your hearts to God, and he will now ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy you with an enlarged freedom in all happy circumſtances, both <hi>internally</hi> and <hi>externally,</hi> becoming a people peculiarly
