            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>THE ambitious deſire of ſeeing your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's name prefixed to this little work may perhaps, in ſome degree, be excuſed, on the following conſiderations: The firſt is, that this circumſtance will immediately excite that preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice in its favour, which there could be no hope of its receiving from the name of the tranſlator: The other is, that, appearing under the patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of your Majeſty, its power of doing good will be conſiderably enlarged.</p>
                  <p>WHATEVER influence vanity may have on the former of theſe motives, the latter cannot, I hope, be blamed. And if theſe pages ſhould
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:029954_0003_0FE381029354A390"/>
appear calculated to inculcate the principles, or to encourage the practice of VIRTUE, no other argument, I am confident, need be urged to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce your Majeſty to ſuffer them to come forth under the ſanction of your illuſtrious auſpices.</p>
                  <p>A LADY of high rank, inſtructing her children in virtue and religion, and forming their tender minds to whatſoever may render them wiſe and good, ſeems, for very obvious reaſons, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly entitled to your Majeſty's gracious atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But though the reſemblance betwixt your Majeſty and the principal character before you, ſo far as her parental ſolicitude extends, is too ſtriking to eſcape our notice; yet do we thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully reflect, that in one reſpect a very eſſential difference may be obſerved: this lady, MADAM, employed only the uncertain intervals of ſickneſs, and the anxious moments of an expiring life, in the diſcharge of that important duty, which is well known to engage your Majeſty's beſt hours of youth, and health, and vigour.</p>
                  <p>MAY your Majeſty happily perſevere in ſo good a work! to the edification of your amiable Offspring in every princely virtue—to the great
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:029954_0003_0FE381029354A390"/>
delight of your loyal and affectionate ſubjects— to the furtherance of their Royal Highneſſes' preſent and future happineſs—and, above all, to the glory and praiſe of GOD!</p>
                  <p>SUCH is the prayer of thouſands; and, among the reſt, of one, who preſumes to ſubſcribe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, with all imaginable duty and reſpect,</p>

                  <head>THE TRANSLATOR's PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>IN one of <hi>Pope Ganganelli</hi>'s letters, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing work is honourably mentioned, as being <hi>a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete treatiſe on Education.</hi> From the moment of my ſeeing it thus ſpoken of, I determined to examine its pretenſions to ſo favourable a character. The pains it has coſt me, to render it of general uſe to my countrymen, may be conſidered as the beſt proof of my opinion in this reſpect.</p>
                  <p>I can truly ſay, I have read the book with inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible delight: the involuntary tear has more than once been witneſs to my approbation of that tenderneſs of affection, with which it abounds. And the hours, which I have moſt agreeably, and I truſt not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitably, paſſed in the ſociety of this incomparable mother, have made me ample amends for the trouble
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:029954_0004_0FE3810885D47268"/>
I have taken, in endeavouring to do juſtice to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of her ſentiments, the warmth of her affection, and the pathetic engergy of her expreſſions.</p>
                  <p>For myſelf, I claim no more merit from the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tranſlation, than that which is due to a good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is poſſible, that many may profit by theſe excellent inſtructions, who are unacquainted with the language in which they were written; and ſome even of thoſe, who are acquainted with it, may yet read them with greater eaſe and benefit in their own tongue.</p>
                  <p>A cloſe compariſon with the original, I foreſee, may be unfavourable to my reputation as a tranſlator; but it cannot injure it as an honeſt man. For, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out adhering with too ſervile an attachment to my author, I have endeavoured to expreſs the ſentiments before me as exactly as poſſible, except only in a very few paſſages; where, for obvious reaſons, it was neceſſary to give a different turn to the expreſſions of this excellent woman. In all other inſtances, I have cauſe to think meanly of myſelf, in proportion as I have departed from the original; as nothing can be more pure, more inſtructive, or more affecting, than the genuine dictates of that heart, which gave utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to theſe moſt intereſting conferences.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="viii" facs="unknown:029954_0005_0FE3810D25F58398"/>If, upon the whole, the following work be read with candour, the tranſlator has no doubt of the reader's indulgence: if otherwiſe, he has little to hope for, either with reſpect to the reader or himſelf. He who is deſirous to profit by the inſtructions here preſented to him, will be more diſpoſed to tranſcribe them into his own conduct, than to criticiſe on the preciſe terms in which they are conveyed.</p>
                  <p>There never was a period, in which ſuch an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to the prevailing manners of the age was more neceſſary than the preſent. It will be a matter of unſpeakable ſatisfaction to me, if the following pages ſhould lay the leaſt reſtraint on any of the ſons or daughters of pleaſure; and if, withdrawing their attention from the purſuit of a phantom, a bubble, and toy, they ſhould direct it to thoſe objects, which religion recommends, which reaſon approves, and which virtue and good ſenſe univerſally applayd and admire.</p>

                  <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
                  <p>WE here preſent you with the pure effuſions of parental tenderneſs: as filial affection pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved them from being loſt, ſo a deſire to promote the benefit of mankind has induced me to make them public.</p>
                  <p>THIS excellent woman having herſelf given us the hiſtory of her life in her firſt diſcourſe, we ſhall only add, that ſhe had every advantage of perſon and underſtanding; and that nothing can be more affecting, than that diſplay of female delicacy and manly ſenſe, which appear in theſe conferences with her children.</p>
                  <p>WE here ſee a mother, elevated as it were above herſelf, and inſenſible of the miſeries of ſickneſs, and the horrors of the grave; while ſhe is inculcating in the minds of her children the duties which they owe to GOD, to their countr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and to ſociety. Her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is chiefly directed to thoſe two of her ſons, who had engaged in a military life; in one of theſe conferences, ſhe addreſſes herſelf particularly to her third ſon, who had dedicated himſelf to the church: another is confined to the inſtruction of her daughter. In all of them, her admonitions are enforced with tears, and interrupted by ſighs; they are the natural dictates of the tendereſt affection, which no bodily
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:029954_0006_0FE38114D2C0B478"/>
infirmities could prevail with her to ſuppreſs. If the reader finds not in this work thoſe epiſodes, or that variety which diſtinguiſhes a romance, it is only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Truth wants none of theſe embelliſhments: ſhe needs only to be ſeen, to command our attention and our admiration: the voice of nature is heard throughout the work, and the eloquence here diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played is the forcible language of the heart.</p>
                  <p>THE evening being made choice of as the propereſt ſeaſon for inſtruction, we find the work divided into EVENING CONFERENCES. The whole was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully collected by the induſtry of an AMANUENSIS, ſo placed as to be an ear-witneſs of all that paſſed. Had not this care been taken, the world would have been deprived of an invaluable ſyſtem of education, which no one can read with inattention, and few without improvement.</p>
                  <p>THE reader will at once perceive, that though the expreſſions of our admirable inſtructreſs are diveſted of ornament and art, ſhe was a perſon of ſuperior abilities, and great knowledge.</p>
                  <p>IT were a tribute juſtly due to the memory of ſuch a lady, to tranſmit her name, with all the reſpect which is due to it, to poſterity. But as her humility induced her to wiſh ſhe might not be recorded after her death, we think ourſelves obliged to do violence to our inclinations, in compliance with her laſt requeſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="xi" facs="unknown:029954_0006_0FE38114D2C0B478"/>NOR are we at all apprehenſive, that this conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will impeach the authenticity of the work: it is conceived in ſuch terms, as to convince any judicious reader, that ſuch ſentiments could only be founded in nature. Here are no brilliant conceits, no affected phraſes; but the artleſs expreſſions of maternal affection: he who does not yield to the force of ſuch evidence as this, muſt be conſidered as one who cannot diſtinguiſh what is really the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of nature; or as one who never yet experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced the power of ſentimental affection.</p>
                  <p>PROBABILITY does not always go hand in hand with truth; but they are happily united in this work. What indeed can be conceived more natural, than that a tender mother, anxious for her children's welfare, ſhould take advantage of her gradually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining health to ſet before them the vanities of the world; and to give them the beſt directions for the regulation of their conduct? Let any man enter ſeriouſly into himſelf; liſten to the language of his own heart—he will ſoon find, that thoſe noble ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which occur in the following pages, could never have been the offspring of imagination. The life of this incomparable mother was but too ſhort, as it did not exceed thirty-nine years; but ſhe will yet live in theſe her genuine conferences, which no doubt will be watered with the reader's tears.</p>

                     <p>THE very weak ſtate of health, in which I have now been eighteen months, forbids me to hope for any long continuation of my life I have determined therefore, my dear children, to call yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>YOU are not inſenſible of the obligations laid upon you, to ſhew mankind from what anceſtors you derive your origin. Their hiſtory you are ſufficiently acquainted with, to know WHO they were, and HO<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="2" facs="unknown:029954_0008_0FE3811FC1ADC770"/>
beſt friend, who is now converſing with you; one, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions are the dictates of affection, and the reſult of a tender regard for your happineſs. The only books, from which my precepts ſhall be drawn, are experience, a knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of the world, and the convictions of my own heart.</p>
                     <p>DESCENDED from a family not leſs diſtinguiſhed by its misfortunes than its honours, I was left an orphan at ten years of age. My education fell under the direction of my father's ſiſter; whoſe inclination, as well as rank, drew her frequently to court. No time was loſt in furniſhing me with maſters of every kind. I ſoon became an object of attention; and my friends took care to announce me poſſeſſed of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable fortune. The world preſented itſelf to my view in the moſt brilliant colours; and with ſingular delight I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ged the deception. A ſucceſſion of amuſements ſerved to ſtifle reflection; and I ſeemed to live for no other purpoſe than to purſue my pleaſures.</p>
                     <p>SOMETIMES my ſoul, not quite as yet debaſed, ſeemed deſirous to ſoar above theſe enchanting trifles; but vanity and diſſipation ſoon hurried me away, and effaced the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of reflection. How far from real happineſs is a life of ſubjection to prevailing faſhions; from which it has neither opportunity, nor reſolution to withdraw itſelf! In vain do we perceive the miſeries, which intrude themſelves amidſt the pleaſures of the world; in vain do we receive inſtructions, by which we might be both affected and improved: we ſtill continue enſlaved to our paſſions, and eagerly embrace the phantom of deluſion. I reſembled thoſe travellers, who, knowing the right way, yet thinking to ſhorten their journey, turn aſide from it, and are loſt.</p>
                     <p>ALL that were about me, conſpired to fill my mind with falſe ideas; their language was that of flattery and deceit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>
                        <pb n="3" facs="unknown:029954_0008_0FE3811FC1ADC770"/>
they either concealed from me my faults, or they only cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected ſuch as might ſerve to render me ridiculous. Scarce had I begun the day, when my attendants made it their buſineſs to inſpire me with a love of idleneſs and pleaſure: one part of it was ſpent in decorating my perſon with all the ornaments of dreſs; and the other, in receiving the rewards of my unprofitable induſtry. I was admired, in proportion to my external appearance; and this admiration ſerved only to feed my vanity.</p>
                     <p>I NEVER ſhall forget, that, being one evening quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with that ſatiety, which deſtroys the ſatisfaction of the votaries of pleaſure, I opened by chance a volume of moral eſſays, a few <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> of which ſilled my ſoul with confuſion and remorſe: "<hi>Either,</hi> ſaid I to myſelf. <hi>I am a dupe to the life which I now lead, or this writer is an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>gious impoſtor.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>THESE reflections began to diſquiet me; when I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that it was time for me to go to a ball, to which I had been invited: my guardian, who took me with her in her coach, obſerved that I was unuſually penſive; for which ſhe ſeriouſly reproved me. Though ſhe was in many reſpects an excellent woman, ſhe was almoſt wholly engaged in the purſuit of amuſements: ſhe repeated her cenſures, when we entered the ball-room, in which every thing appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed truly magnificent; the elegant taſte of the D—ſs of— had brought together perſons of the moſt eminent rank, beauty, and accompliſhments.</p>
                     <p>TOO ſoon the inſtruments of muſic, and harmony of the voices, made me forget my Monitor, and all his reaſoning: my heart, again ſeduced by pleaſure, quickly perſuaded me that ſuch auſtere morality was calculated only to fill us with melancholy: I danced with ſome degree of elegance, and the praiſes beſtowed upon me were exceſſive; in ſhort, I returned home more enchanted than ever, with the world.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="4" facs="unknown:029954_0009_0FE3812465C26990"/>WE croſſed the park, which a judicious diſtribution of lamps had ſo illuminated, as to give it almoſt the glare of noon-day. The crowd of people about us, the variety of faces and dreſſes, an unreſtrained feſtivity, which every where prevailed, all ſerved to ſeduce my ſoul with ſtronger deluſions. One needs no more than ſuch a ſcene as this, to ruin one's taſte forever. It fills the mind with the vaſt idea of the world and its plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; and when once the heart has received theſe firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, it is next to impoſſible to efface them.</p>
                     <p>SIX years paſſed away in a continual round of pleaſure and diverſions; at the end of which, I was married to your much honoured father. Some circumſtances, fortunate for me, gave HIM the preference in my regard to ſeveral young noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who had profeſſed the ſtrongeſt attachment to me. Had any one of THESE ſucceeded in his addreſſes, I ſhould have been wedded to folly and repentance; it was my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier lot to be connected with diſcretion and politeneſs.</p>
                     <p>WE muſt needs appear with eclat on our marriage, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> this reſpect my natural turn of mind was of great ſervice to me; it made me as ſplendid, as I was vain: And as our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come was ſuch as enabled me to indulge my taſte for ſhew, I gave the reins to it without reſtraint. I kept a ſort of court, in which I preſided as a ſovereign princeſs: My cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers were laviſh of their praiſes, they were ſuppliant for favours, and my huſband and I were conſidered as beings ſuperior to the reſt of mankind in happineſs and honours.</p>
                     <p>A WAR with the houſe of Auſtria deprived me of your father, for a time: He parted from me with that heroic ſpirit, which diſtinguiſhed his character to the lateſt moment of his life; while in his abſence I gave myſelf up to ſorrow and regret. His letters, however, comforted me; and no ſonner was my peace of mind reſtored, than my taſte for
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:029954_0009_0FE3812465C26990"/>
pleaſure returned. The opera of THETIS was performed, at which I was preſent; and then it was, that my fondneſs for publick diverſions reſumed its dominion in my heart. I now put myſelf forward to ſit in judgment on every new theatrical performance; and was the firſt to admire the deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the ſtage. The world is like a troubled ſea, whoſe waves always carry us away much farther than we at firſt intended to go.</p>
                     <p>HOWEVER, notwithſtanding my allowed taſte for whatever might gratify the ſenſes, or encourage vanity; I was generally conſidered as a pattern of prudence and diſcretion: People were aſtoniſhed to ſee a young woman, only twenty years old, with any other paſſion than a love for dreſs, and ſhew, and diverſions. The world cannot conceive it poſſible, that while we are gliding down the ſtream of luxury and pleaſure, we are, in the eye of reaſon, objects of pity.</p>
                     <p>THE hints, which I had received from my friendly Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, whoſe writings I had only curſorily dipt into, were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually obtruding themſelves; but, like thoſe gentle breezes, which ruffle the ſurface of the waters, they only ſerved to glance upon my heart. What ſurprized me was, that a very diſcreet relation of mine, to whom I had mentioned this author, ſtrictly forbade me looking into it. But this ſhe did, as ſhe many years afterwards declared, merely to excite my eagerneſs to read it, and attach me more ſtrongly to my book. She well knew, that prohibition ſerves only to ſtimulate; and that to interdict, is often the ſureſt means of fixing our affections on that which is forbidden us. Her ſtratagem ſucceeded; I was never at reſt, 'till I became poſſeſſed of theſe eſſays, and 'till I had read them again and again. His reflections gave me ſome uneaſineſs; but I was ſo far from being amended by them, that I only compared this emotion
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:029954_0010_0FE3812BE57E5BB0"/>
to the tranſient effect of a tragical repreſentation on the ſtage. I was affected for a moment, and that was all.</p>
                     <p>AT length, your father returned from the war, covered with wounds and laurels: The compliments which were paid to him at court, and the honours which were heaped upon him, occaſioned a ſecond diverſion of my thoughts, which plunged me deeper than ever in the gulf of diſſipation.</p>
                     <p>MY firſt ſtudy was, to be diſtinguiſhed by the elegance of my entertainments; and in this I was very ſucceſsful; my exquiſite taſte was generally admired, and every one expreſſed the higheſt ſatisfaction. What an encouragement was this to a woman, whoſe only ambition was to ſhine in her ſphere, to pleaſe and be applauded! You will not wonder, that our expences were exceſſive; and that, to ſupport our vanity, we diminiſhed our ſubſtance, and conſequently your inheritance.</p>
                     <p>YOU ſee, my dear children, that I lay open to you, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſerve, all the circumſtances of my life; and that my language is that of one, whoſe heart dictates nothing but tenderneſs and ſincerity. Where my conduct has been faulty, you will, I am ſure, be the firſt to forgive: It may, perhaps, prove a fortunate circumſtance for YOU, that I, who have been firſt ſeduced into the ways of vanity and folly, am the better enabled to point out to you that path, which it will be your wiſdom and happineſs to purſue.</p>
                     <p>CERTAIN it is, that this abridgment of our fortune wrought ſome change in my manner of life: Your father again left me in obedience to the orders of the court, which ſent him into ITALY; and I endeavoured to amuſe myſelf in his abſence by reading our beſt hiſtorians.</p>
                     <p>THERE with delight I found the name, which you bear, mentioned with honour in the French and Engliſh hiſtory;
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:029954_0010_0FE3812BE57E5BB0"/>
there ſaw I thoſe virtues diſplayed by your anceſtors, which I hope it will be the ſtudy of your lives to imitate.</p>
                     <p>ABOUT this time, my friendſhip commenced with the Counteſs of S—, an excellent lady, of whom the hand of death has lately deprived the world; in which ſhe ſeemed to live for no other purpoſe, than to do good. Her converſation charmed me; her prudence delighted me; there was no opportunity of inſtruction, which ſhe did not improve; and this ſhe did with ſo much eaſe and affability, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſo natural and agreeable, that the moſt inconſiderate could not but attend to her: She often urged to me the neceſſity of uniting in the ſame character the Philoſopher and the Chriſtian. Here I muſt acknowledge, not without taking ſhame to myſelf, that the pleaſures of the world left me nothing more than a fruitleſs deſire of being what I ought to be. It was continually interpoſing itſelf between the conviction of my judgment, and the propenſities of my will, 'till my mind was utterly diſtracted: I would, and I would not; and my exiſtence was nothing more than a life perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally interrupted with doubt and perplexity.</p>
                     <p>IN this ſtrange ſituation did your father find me at his return. The King received him with that gracious air, which often ſerves inſtead of more ſubſtantial favours; and which is in fact equivalent to a recompence. Every one partook of my joy; and dragged me out, as it were, in ſpite of myſelf, into the midſt of pleaſures and diverſions. Paris and Verſailles, each in its turn, beheld me wholly engaged in doing honour to my huſband on account of his good fortune. Pleaſure and ambition are cruel tyrants; they leave us not a moment to ourſelves; and when they have filled us with hope, they almoſt always abandon us to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="8" facs="unknown:029954_0011_0FE381308B4AEE20"/>YOUR father, though much engaged in the buſineſs of the world, had his intervals of ſolitude and retirement: He ſometimes pleaded indiſpoſition, that he might apply himſelf to the ſtudy of his profeſſion; and, as I imagined, to amuſe himſelf by a change of employment. He found, that the world has every thing that is good in it, except true wiſdom.</p>
                     <p>THE reſtleſs ſpirit of mankind renewed the war; and again obliged me to live in a ſtate of ſeparation from a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who was dearer to me than myſelf. His valour, which rendered him inſenſible of danger, procured him at the ſame time the honour—of being grievouſly wounded, and of being made a Lieutenant-General. Joy and ſolicitude by turns took poſſeſſion of my heart; and in this anxious ſtate I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, 'till I was fully aſſured of his perfect recovery.</p>
                     <p>THIS advancement of my huſband revived my paſſion for the vanities of the world: I now again felt myſelf inclined to taſte largely of the pleaſures of the court. I hired one houſe at Verſailles, and another at Fontainbieau; and my taſte for luxury, together with my natural vanity, led me to fit them up in the moſt expenſive manner. I piqued myſelf on having more elegant furniture than any woman of my rank, and on having my table more ſumptuouſly ſupplied. I became pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial for the magnificence of my entertainments; and happy was the man, who could be preſent at them. Perſons of faſhion aſſembled at my houſe with eagerneſs; and each endeavoured to diſtinguiſh himſelf by the utmoſt exertion of pleaſantry and humour.</p>
                     <p>I NEVER found myſelf ſo far removed from wiſdom, as when I was ſurrounded by the moſt celebrated wits: I heard nothing from them but ſallies of mirth, which interrupted all ſerious thoughts; and ſuch flighty converſation, as ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only to ſtifle reflection. Our deciſions were peremptory
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:029954_0011_0FE381308B4AEE20"/>
on every ſubject, and were wholly influenced by faſhion and by prejudice.</p>
                     <p>THUS was my mind entirely taken up in the purſuit of folly; inſtead of being employed, as it ought to have been, in attending to your education.</p>
                     <p>THE prevalence of cuſtom, my dear children, had taught me to think, that I ought not to have you with me more than a few days in a year; with which cuſtom I could n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, without doing violence to my tenderneſs and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ion for you. Inſtead of endeavouring to inform myſelf, what ſchool was under the beſt and wiſeſt regulation, my inquiry was, which was the moſt genteel; and I was much more deſirous that you ſhould form honourable connexions, than that you ſhould receive good inſtructions: Thus did I ſecretly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage your vanity, while your IMPROVEMENT ought to have been my principal care. When we cannot amend our faults, the leaſt we can do is to acknowledge them: And do not think that I offer any violence to myſelf in thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing my folly, and indiſcretion: It is my greateſt comfort, that I am giving you this ſureſt evidence of my repentance. If my affection for you were leſs than it is, I ſhould ſpeak to you with leſs ſincerity; it is the compunction I feel, for having liſtened more attentively to the voice of cuſtom than to that of my duty, which extorts from me this undiſguiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed profeſſion of my miſconduct; in ſhort, my extreme ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude for you, baniſhes every ſelfiſh conſideration from my mind.</p>
                     <p>THE conduct of your father diſtinguiſhed him now more than ever. He was deſervedly eſteemed a moſt accompliſhed ſoldier; inſomuch that I dare venture to aſſert, without fearing the imputation of partiality or oſtentation, that the dignity of Field-Marſhal, to which he was advanced, was

no more than a diſtinction due to his ſuperior merit as an officer. He ſaw himſelf elevated to the higheſt point of honour in his profeſſion; at a time of life, wherein he was very capable of enjoying the fruits of his promotion; being at that time not fifty years old.</p>
                     <p>I WAS too fond of gaiety and pleaſure, not to ſurpaſs on this occaſion all my former inſtances of luxury and expenſe. Balls, illuminations and entertainments of every kind, conſpired to celebrate that happy event, which filled my heart with joy; and nothing was now to be ſeen around me, but trophie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> erected to my vanity: I was wholly taken up in going from one circle to another, eager to receive congratulation and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe from every quarter. But how inconſtant is all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glory! alas! your father died within three years after his promotion to the honour of a Marſhal: And my heart, overpowered by this dreadful ſtroke, ſeemed to go down with him even into the grave. He died like a Chriſtian philoſopher; full of loyalty to his King, full of tenderneſs for his wife and children; and moſt earneſtly deſiring to be admitted into the preſence of GOD. He would have been better pleaſed, had his laſt breath been drawn in the ſervice of his country; and had he been permitted to make com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation with his life, for the honours which his ſovereign had heaped upon him.</p>
                     <p>THE firſt year of my widowhood was wholly given up to the effuſions of grief; to an utter diſreliſh for every kind of ſatisfaction, and to an entire indifference about myſelf and every thing around me. I thought of nothing, but a moſt affectionate huſband, who was now no more; and this ſad idea ſerved only to fill my ſoul with the moſt melancholy reflections.</p>
                     <p>I COULD then have readily anſwered for myſelf, that the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:029954_0012_0FE381386A5A4130"/>
world would never more take poſſeſſion of my heart. But the world is not content with being a maſter only: It is a TYRANT, which holds its vaſſals in fetters of iron; from which in vain I endeavoured to releaſe myſelf: My former habits reſumed their empire in my heart; and though I did not forget my huſband, I forgot all my reſolutions. I now appeared a faſhionable widow; wholly taken up by the pleaſures of the world, and all its vanities. My greateſt comfort in this moment of reflection is, that I never could be prevailed with to liſten to any propoſals of a ſecond mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. I had too much reſpect for the memory of your father, ever to conſent to loſe his name; and I had too much regard for you his children, ever to endanger your welfare and happineſs by ſuch a ſtep. This double attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ſuperior to every other conſideration; I felt myſelf altogether devoted to my children; who I feared might be leſs the objects of my attention, if I transferred my affections to any other: This ſingle circumſtance was ſufficient to determine me. Heaven grant, that you may make me the beſt return for this ſacrifice, not merely by your thanks, but by the tendereſt regard for my happineſs. I have not a more ſincere wiſh, than to excite your affection; and as I am truly ſenſible of the full extent of my own, no one ſurely can blame me for earneſtly deſiring, that our love for each other ſhould be reciprocal.</p>
                     <p>WERE I ſo unhappy as to diſcover in either of you an abatement of affection towards me, I ſhould remind you, that there is not one of you, whoſe birth was not almoſt the occaſion of my death; and that the more I ſuffered in bringing you into the world, the more cloſely is my heart attached to you: This only knows to what degree you have hitherto engaged its affections; and I can truly ſay, that,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:029954_0013_0FE3813D1A16F098"/>
amidſt the diſſipations of a life of pleaſure, I never felt any REAL ſatisfaction but in ſeeing you thus ſitting round me. Happy moment! the only one which can afford me a gleam of conſolation for a loſs, which I can never ceaſe to lament.</p>
                     <p>BUT, to return to the world; which continually enſlaved my affections, and which, whilſt I was engaged in the grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ification of my paſſion for pleaſure, ſuffered me not to reſt, day or night. I had ſacrificed to it the beſt moments of my life; the hours deſtined to calm repoſe were devoted to it; and, on the return of every day, freſh ſnares were laid for me; and new temptations offered to engage me in its ſervice. I found myſelf abſolutely ſubject to its caprice; I was preſent at every publick aſſembly; I had a high opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of its extravagancies; I ſtudied all its refinements; I commended only what the world approved; I rejected only what the world condemned: I was, in ſhort, as much a ſlave to its commands, as one who has no power to move or act, without the permiſſion of his maſter.</p>
                     <p>SOMETIMES, quite wearied with its importunity, I wiſhed to ſhake off the yoke; and to enter into a ſerious examination or my heart; of which it had too long maintained an entire diſpoſal: But ſuch tranſient inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions only ſerved to convince me of my weakneſs. This ſufficiently appeared, when after ſome days of ſtrict retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ſhould have been the commencement of a new life, a ſlight invitation called me forth again, to put myſelf under the power of my tyrant; and made me fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhly repent of having ever wiſhed to withdraw myſelf from his dominion.</p>
                     <p>IN the mean time I began to perceive that the ſpring of my life was paſſed and gone; and that it was time to break
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:029954_0013_0FE3813D1A16F098"/>
the charm, which thus ſeduced me: However the lot was caſt, and rather than have recourſe to reaſon, I employed every artifice to ſupply the deficiency of blooming youth. Thus did I at once endeavour to impoſe on others, and delude myſelf; and nothing but the aſtoniſhing incident which I am going to relate, was capable of overcoming this dangerous illuſion.</p>
                     <p>HAVING been informed that a new play was to be acted, I engaged to go with a party of friends to the theatre, and among the reſt, with Lady —, whom I loved with the tendereſt affection. At the appointed hour, I called at the door of my friend. Surpriſed, at my arrival, not to find any of the ſervants ready to receive me, I immediately ran up into her bed-chamber; I went to her, and ſaluting her, I aſked her the reaſon why ſhe was not ready to go with me: Oh! Heaven! She was dead! Her countenance ſtill retained its beauty; her fleſh was yet warm, but her body was motionleſs and lifeleſs! Having ſhricked ſo loud as to fill the whole houſe with my cries, I fell into a ſwoon, which laſted above an hour and a half. The domeſticks, who in their conſternation had fled different ways, re-aſſembled at the noiſe of my cries; and uſed every poſſible endeavour to bring me to my ſenſes. After which, they informed me, that their miſtreſs was juſt dead of a quinſy, that had choked her. Conceive, if you can, the horrors of my ſituation; I was almoſt ſuffocated with grief, which laboured to expreſs itſelf; and in the utmoſt terror and amazement, I withdrew from this ſcene.</p>
                     <p>BY this method it ſeemed that heaven thought fit to act upon my mind, to diſſipate impoſture and deluſion. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to my houſe, wherein I ſaw nothing but emblems of pride and vanity. I now diſcovered for the firſt time, that
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:029954_0014_0FE38145A536DEE8"/>
thoſe ſpecious charms, with which the world had ſo long deceived me, were in reality no better than ſplendid miſeries. I now reflected, that I had been only a dupe to my own pride, and the faſhions of the world: That I had been running after a phantom of happineſs, which had eſcaped me; that human life was moſt uncertain in its tenure; in ſhort, that my eſſayeſt, who had diſtreſſed me, had told me the truth; and that one muſt be abſolutely blind, not to ſee the force of his arguments.</p>
                     <p>AS I had learnt from experience to diſtruſt my own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I felt no inclination to make a publick profeſſion of my change of ſentiments; eſpecially, as I knew that it is not eaſy to ſupport a conſiſtency of character in extremes; that too great zeal is ſeldom laſting, and almoſt always indiſcreet; and that to diſcharge the duties of Chriſtianity, it was ſufficient to be—a Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>HOWEVER, I inſenſibly withdrew myſelf from the world and its pleaſures; and under a pretence of taking care of my health, as my conſtitution had been always delicate, I began with living very much alone, and no more mixing in large companies. I was conſidered as an invalid; and after a few cenſures from my acquaintance, the world as eaſily reſigned me, as it had formerly ſolicited me. There is nothing ſooner forgotten, than a perſon, who wiſhes to be ſo: one's retirement from the world may afford a topic of converſation for a day, and to-morrow nothing more is ſaid about us.</p>
                     <p>MY ſolitude being neither the affectation of ſingularity, nor the effect of ill humour, but the reſult of ſerious reflection; I continued to diſcharge the duties which I owed to ſociety: I made my appearance at court, when it was thought neceſſary; I viſited my acquaintance when
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:029954_0014_0FE38145A536DEE8"/>
civility required it: I paid that attention to the duties of my ſtation, which it appeared to demand; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> it down as a maxim, only to abſtain from ſuch things, as religion and reaſon forbade.</p>
                     <p>VERY ſoon the pleaſure of reading ſerious books, and of ſtudying myſelf, convinced me, that true happineſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in conformity to truth; and that they, who give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to a life of diſſipation, have in reality nothing more than the ſhadow of happineſs.</p>
                     <p>THAT horrible ſpectacle before mentioned, continually preſented itſelf to my mind. I never can forget, that, whilſt I fancied I was embracing a living friend, I held in my arms only a lifeleſs corpſe, on which GOD himſelf had already paſſed an irrevocable ſentence! At midnight the image of my friend very frequently appeared to my diſturbed imagination; whom I had been wiſhing to drag to the theatre, while heaven was pronouncing an irreverſible decree either of life or death everlaſting.</p>
                     <p>THIS it was, my children, which opened my eyes to a ſight of my duty; this it was, which determined me to cultivate and improve your good diſpoſitions, and to ſow in your hearts the ſeeds of virtue and religion.</p>
                     <p>MAY heaven bleſs and proſper my deſign! Indeed it is with the greateſt ſatisfaction I obſerve, that your ſentiments appear to be ſuch, as ſeem likely to do honour to the memory of your father; and that you want nothing but a little more knowledge and information, and a little more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to attain it. It is with a deſign to aſſiſt you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that I have determined to call you together every evening, when my health will permit; and to diſcourſe with you on ſome of the moſt intereſting ſubjects. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now given you the hiſtory of my own life, I ſhall

henceforth concern myſelf only about your's; and ſhall endeavour to furniſh you with the beſt inſtructions in my power, that you may become acceptable to your GOD, uſeful to your Country, and worthy of the King whom you have the honour to ſerve.</p>

                     <p>IN vain, my dear children, do my phyſicians flatter me on the ſubject of my health. I perceive myſelf haſtily declining, and am apprehenſive, that if I any longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to guard you againſt the rocks and ſhoals which you may meet with in your paſſage through the world, whether from the tyranny of cuſtom, or from the violence of your own paſſions, I might never be able to diſcharge that duty, to which my own affection for you, and the dying requeſt of your father, ſo powerfully excite me. His laſt words ſtill ſounding in my ear, as if they had been uttered by a voice from heaven, dwelt only on this great ſubject: The recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion fills my ſoul with an inexpreſſible mixture of tenderneſs and grief.</p>
                     <p>ALAS! our united tears will never be ſufficient to deplore our loſs: thoſe, which I ſee you ſhed at this time, are the ſtrongeſt aſſurance that you inherit his generous ſentiments, and it is the only pleaſure which at preſent I feel myſelf ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of enjoying.</p>
                     <p>YOUR excellent father, juſt before his death, taking me by the hand, expreſſed himſelf neatly in the following words:
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:029954_0015_0FE3814A4D268038"/>
                        <hi>Let your firſt care, I moſt earneſtly entreat you, be the education of my children: Be yourſelf their principal inſtructor; and fail not to inculcate with all imaginable earneſtneſs this great truth, that they are born for no other purpoſe, than to conſecrate their lives to the ſervice of their</hi> GOD, <hi>and their King; and that they will then only do honour to the memory of their father, when they faithfully diſcharge this two-fold Duty.</hi> You cannot conceive, my dear children, with what heart-felt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs I recal to mind this laſt moſt affecting ſcene; it pierces my ſoul with the livelieſt ſenſations of grief. But my ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for your welfare gets the better of every other conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and I had rather tear open my wounds afreſh, than conceal from you a circumſtance, which cannot but affect you in the ſtrongeſt manner. I have always kept it treaſured up in my breaſt, as a valuable depoſit; which I intended ſome time or other to produce, whenever you ſhould be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to judge of its value and importance,</p>
                     <p>I CALL heaven to witneſs, that neither buſineſs nor pleaſure has ever been able to efface the remembrance of your father: On the contrary, he is always preſent to my mind; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is this lively repreſentation of him, which alone en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables me to ſupport his loſs. Without this painful reſource, my mind would have abſolutely ſunk beneath the burthen of my grief.</p>
                     <p>BUT now the hour approaches, when I ſhall be re-united to the tendereſt of huſbands; when our aſhes, mixed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſhall teach you, my dear children, the inſtability of every earthly poſſeſſion, and the wiſdom of deſpiſing the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary vanities of life, when brought into compariſon with the treaſures of an immortal ſtate.</p>
                     <p>IT is by ſuch reflections as theſe, that order and regularity are beſt preſerved in our minds; and that we are taught the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:029954_0016_0FE38151AB716DF0"/>
neceſſity of doing nothing contrary to the rules of prudence and diſcretion.</p>
                     <p>THIS practice is ſo eſſential to our happineſs, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the deſigns of our Creator, that it cannot be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected without a violation of the laws of GOD. It is this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to duty and propriety, by which peace is preſerved in kingdoms, and union in families: It is this which regulates the conduct of the ſervant towards his maſter, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject towards his prince; it is this which engages my love towards you, and your reſpect towards me: It is this which makes YOU ſtudious to mitigate my ſorrows, and ME inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly ſolicitous to advance your happineſs.</p>
                     <p>IT is this regularity of conduct, which makes us good pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, good friends, and good citizens; which gives us a right judgment of things, and aſſiſts us both in the choice of the fitteſt time and the propereſt method of doing whatever is to be done. It is one of the greateſt misfortunes in the world, to live without any ſtated rule of conduct, in perpetual diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and confuſion. Our life ſhould be a tranſcript of the harmony of the univerſe; which could not ſubſiſt, much leſs attract our admiration, were it not for that juſt proportion, which is diſcoverable in all its parts. Take away order from the world, and you reduce it to a frightful chaos: Leave man without any other guide than his own paſſions and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice; and there will be nothing but perpetual diſcord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his judgment and his will.</p>
                     <p>RUIN enſues, when a man exhibits in his own ill-governed mind the miſeries of anarchy: His ideas are confuſed; his imagination is bewildered; his conſcience is miſled; his reaſon is obſcured; and his ſoul becomes the ſeat of confuſion and irregularity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="19" facs="unknown:029954_0016_0FE38151AB716DF0"/>IF you do not accuſtom yourſelves, at your firſt ſetting out in life, to lay down ſome regular plan of conduct; you will never attain to that rectitude of judgment, which eſtimates things according to their worth: And which, in the midſt of errors and prejudices, will enable you to give the preference to truth.</p>
                     <p>YOUR father's inclinations were ſo wiſely regulated, that his behaviour was always influenced by a ſtrict regard to propriety: He knew, with the philoſopher, that we ought to weigh the motives of our conduct; and every evening to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into an examination of our actions.</p>
                     <p>THE man, who lives at random, is a ſlave to his own whims and caprice. The world reprobates ſuch an one, as a monſter which diſturbs its harmony; and ſociety rejects him, as a being incapable of friendſhip. We ſee, in ſhort, that, whoever is thus irregular in his own mind, is deſtitute of every quality, which can contribute to the ornament or benefit of human life: His mannners are diſguſting, his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes are exceſſive, and his whole conduct unaccountable.</p>
                     <p>Do not think that I am carried away by my imagination beyond the truth; which I ſhall always ſtrictly obſerve in converſing with you. The too ſad experience of many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms what I ſay; and it may ſerve to teach you that it is impoſſible rightly to manage your affairs, or diſcharge your duty without a proper command of your mind and paſſions; every movement of which ſhould be as nicely regulated, as thoſe of a well finiſhed clock.</p>
                     <p>THE exact proportion obſervable in every work of GOD is intended to teach us, that order is the greateſt beauty in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and that to deſpiſe this, is to counteract one of the great laws of the Creator of the univerſe. Endeavour then,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:029954_0017_0FE381570FF47CE8"/>
I beſeech you, to imitate in your behaviour that general har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in the creation, which, in the courſe of every year, ſupplies us with whatever is either agreeable or uſeful: Let your ſtudies be methodical, all conducted rather with a view to inſtruction, than mere amuſement. If you read without a plan, you will overload your memory without improving it: And your knowledge will be little better than an undigeſted chaos.</p>
                     <p>THE mind, in which diſorder prevails, is, in the eye of reaſon, like a city without government, or, a houſe without unanimity. But a perſon of this diſpoſition deceives himſelf; and fancies, that if he keeps clear of thoſe irregularities, which are offenſive to ſociety, he may make himſelf eaſy, though he has all the reaſon in the world to be diſſatisfied with his way of life.</p>
                     <p>YOU will find many, who ſeem to delight in nothing but irregularity; who go to reſt when others riſe; who eat, when others faſt; who ſtay at home, when others go to church; in ſhort, whoſe chief employment ſeems to be, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>BE aſſured, that there is nothing ſo bewildered, as the life of a perſon, given up to the hurry and tumult of the world: Such an one has no ſenſe of the value of time; ſhe knows as diſtinction of days, and pays no regard to duty; ſhe ſtudi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="21" facs="unknown:029954_0017_0FE381570FF47CE8"/>
perpetually ſeeking happineſs where it is not to be found; and, though wearied with the purſuit, renews it every day.</p>
                     <p>THE world is full of perſons always engaged in new pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and diſtracted with new deſires; who die without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, becauſe they have lived without any knowledge of themſelves. When the mind is thus diſordered, it is afraid to look into itſelf; or if it ventures to examine things at all, it only does it ſuperficially. The ſenſes are ſo many tyrants, from whoſe power we are unable to deliver ourſelves: And nothing appears really valuable, which does not adminiſter to their gratification.</p>
                     <p>MAINTAIN then the dominion over your own minds, that you be not overcome by thoſe paſſions, which will lay ſiege to your virtue; your thoughts will then be regulated by wiſdom, and you will be raiſed by thoſe clouds, which obſcure the light of the underſtanding. Each of us may be conſidered as an epitome of the world, which is ſubject to eclipſes, changes of weather, to ſtorms and tempeſts. We all obſerve the ſtrange revolutions, which happen in the univerſe; but as Providence, in the midſt of ſuch a multitude of created beings, preſerves the utmoſt harmony both in heaven and earth, ſo ought reaſon to preſerve in the human mind the ſtricteſt attention to order and peace. Without this we degrade ourſelves below the meaneſt inſect, or even the inanimate parts of the creation; which only ſubſiſt to anſwer the purpoſes for which they were made. Behold the bee, or the ant; a thouſand times wiſer, each of them, than the man who deſpiſes them. Theſe never deviate from the laws of their nature, nor from the courſe which Providence has aſſigned them: It is only by an imitation of their conduct and foreſight, that families are maintained, and kingdoms preſerve their power and ſplendour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="22" facs="unknown:029954_0018_0FE3815D658FB518"/>THIS may ſerve to convince you, that whatever ſtate of life you are placed in, it will always be full of diſquiet, if your judgment and your paſſions are at variance with each other: You muſt therefore frequently examine into the ſprings and motives of your conduct, in order to regulate your affections. You will then ſee, as in a picture, the tendency of your actions; and will ſoon be enabled to rectify whatever is amiſs in you.</p>
                     <p>WHEN a houſe is on fire, with what eagerneſs do we haſton to put it out! And ſhall we ſuffer our paſſions to burn with fury, in the midſt of us; without giving ourſelves the leaſt trouble to extinguiſh the flame? We ſeldom reflect that the mind is a kingdom; which cannot be well governed, without a conſtant care as well to defend it from its enemies, as to promote whatever may tend to the eſtabliſhment of peace and tranquility. Conſider the ſtars, which ſhine in their courſes over our heads; conſider the elements which are the ſource of life and reſpiration: Alas! what monitors are theſe to man, to be always ready like them to execute the commands of GOD! This view of the creation perpetually reminds us, that every rational creature alſo ought to move in his proper ſphere, and diſcharge his appointed duty. When we only act as we are influenced by a capricious humour; we inſult the wiſdom of a GOD of order, and raiſe a perpetual tumult in our own breaſts.</p>
                     <p>I HAVE always obſerved, that perſons of a diſſipated turn are as much diſordered with reſpect to their affairs, as they are unſettled in their own minds; and leave no inheritance to their children, but debts and law-ſuits. There is an eaſy kind of arithmetick, which every lover of method is acquainted with; and which conſiſts in computing our obligations and our neceſſities, and our ability to anſwer
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:029954_0018_0FE3815D658FB518"/>
both, in order to keep ourſelves within due bounds, and to pay a proper regard to that which may reaſonably be expected from us. If you have not this love of method, which I wiſh to recommend; you will never be able to regulate your actions, or your families, or your own minds. You will either behave with too great haughtineſs, or with too great familiarity, towards your domeſtics; you will not diſtinguiſh what is ſuperfluous from what is neceſſary; and for want of calculation, you will have nothing but creditors, or debtors who have nothing to pay.</p>
                     <p>YOU are born, my children, to a conſiderable fortune; but what will become of it, if its uſe is not regulated by economy? Riches are abſolute ruin to a diſſipated owner: The ſame confuſion which diſtracts his mind, produces an inconſiſtency in all his actions; one while you ſee an aſtoniſhing prodigality, at another time you are ſhocked with as unreaſonable avarice. He can throw away money, but he cannot give it: He ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>WHEN you are confirmed in this wiſe habit of acting methodically, every part of your conduct will be happily adjuſted: You will ſet apart proper ſeaſons for ſtudy and for recreation; you will manage your time and your income with prudence; you will diſtribute exact juſtice to your neighbours, and you will never engage in any important enterprize, without <hi>conſidering the end.</hi> Nothing will ever make you forget the duties which you owe to your character and ſtation; no day will paſs, in which you will not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber your duty to GOD. We never loſe ſight of theſe duties, but when we give the preference to a life of irregularity; when we go on without a ſingle thought what we are, and what will become of us: Hence it is, that the affections of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:029954_0019_0FE38162DCB286F0"/>
diſorderly perſons differ very little from the propenſities of the brute creation.</p>
                     <p>YOUR good diſpoſitions encourage me to hope that my advice will ſink deep into your hearts. Remember always, that it is the counſel of a mother, who would gladly ſacrifice her life to purchaſe your happineſs; and of a friend, whoſe heart is bound up with your's, and who would not wiſh to live a moment, but in the moſt intimate connexion with you. All the faults of my life have been offences againſt ORDER, which can never be abſolutely neglected, without fruſtrating the end of our creation; for GOD hath doubtleſs made us for this purpoſe, that we might moderate our deſires, and keep our paſſions within proper bounds.</p>
                     <p>BUT if your intentions are good, as I truſt they are, enough has been ſaid on this ſubject; beſides, my want of ſtrength reminds me that it is time to relieve myſelf, and diſmiſs you for the preſent.</p>

                     <p>I DESIGN that the duties, which you owe your country, ſhall be the ſubject of this day's inſtructions; but as this is above my ability properly to handle, your father ſhall ſpeak, inſtead of me. A little before his death, he left me theſe reflections, deſiring me to communicate them to you, when you were of a proper age to receive benefit from them. Read them, therefore; and let us liſten to them with great attention.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="25" facs="unknown:029954_0019_0FE38162DCB286F0"/>THE eldeſt ſon received the manuſcript from his mother, and thus began—</p>
                     <p>"PROVIDENCE, which directs the place of our birth, as well as every other circumſtance of it, has ordained that the country in which we were born, ſhould be dearer to us than any other; and that we may not have the leaſt doubt of the truth of it, this ſentiment is ſo univerſally impreſſed on our minds, that there is not a man upon earth, who is not nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urally A PATRIOT. The whole world may be conſidered as one great family; but the alliance is much ſtricter betwixt thoſe who ſerve the ſame maſter, and are ſubject to the ſame laws. They have all one common intereſt; good and evil are indiſcriminately diſpenſed; and each partakes more or leſs of the proſperity or misfortunes of the ſtate.</p>
                     <p>"THOUGH you owe the tendereſt affection to your mother, you muſt never forget that much is alſo due to the country which gave you birth; and which conſiders you as its child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, and its ſubjects: You muſt divide betwixt them thoſe ſentiments of love and reſpect, which nature has implanted in your hearts. Nay, I will venture to ſay, however jealous I may be of my rights, as your father, that you ought not to heſitate in a caſe of neceſſity, whether you ſhould leave me or not, when your country demands your aſſiſtance. Then it is, that, with the heroic ſelf-denial of a Roman, you muſt ſacrifice every other conſideration, and poſtpone every other intereſt to the duty which you owe to your King and country.</p>
                     <p>"THE firſt character, you ſuſtained, was that of citizens: The ſtate then recognized you as ſubjects, intimately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with it. Religion adopts the ſame language with reaſon: She will teach you that your induſtry and abilities ought to be united in the ſervice of your country; and that it is an abſolute robbery to deprive her of this aſſiſtance.
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:029954_0020_0FE3816ADF84B5D8"/>
She has a right to demand an account of our engagements, and to expect the application of our talents to her advantage. They, therefore, who only employ themſelves in the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of their own vanity, or who lie down in a ſtate of torpid indolence, can only be conſidered as burthens to the ſtate; or as waſps, which come to devour the labour of the bees.</p>
                     <p>"WE are much miſtaken, if we imagine ourſelves at liberty to engage in thoſe ſtudies and employments alone which are moſt pleaſing to ourſelves; the purſuits of one, who wiſhes to be called a patriot, ought to be directed only by the love of his country, and an earneſt deſire to promote her welfare. What would be the ſtate of that kingdom, in which every one, being maſter of his own actions, ſhould do juſt what he pleaſes; and employ all his powers of mind and body, only in the gratification of his own fancy? A cheerful ſubmiſſion to our governors, and a readineſs to ſtand forth in our country's cauſe, give us the trueſt picture of a well ordered and happy government.</p>
                     <p>"YOU, who are already engaged in the publick ſervice, ought to be more ſenſible of this than any others; you are inveſted with honours and advantages, only on condition that you be always ready to aſſiſt your country. Wo be to you, if ever ye forget, that the very blood which ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"HISTORY, ſacred and prophane, is full of examples of perſons, ready to ſacrifice their lives for their country's good; even women, forgetting the weakneſs of their ſex, have become heroines, when the publick welfare demanded their aſſiſtance."</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Indeed, my children, I firmly believe this female heroiſm to be very attainable. I myſelf actually feel reſolution enough, notwithſtanding my bodily infirmities, to carry me even to the mouth of a cannon; and encourage you by my exhortations to chooſe an honourable death, if my duty rendered ſuch a trial neceſſary: Reaſon, in that caſe, would make me altogether regardleſs of myſelf. The conſideration, that I had brought ſuch worthy children into the world, would dry up my tears; and render me rather an object of envy than of pity, in the ſight of my ſovereign and my country.—But go on.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>"THE enjoyment of life is by no means equivalent to the honour of dying for our country: For life is but a ſhadow; whereas the glory which accrues from ſuch a death, is a light which ſurvives the obſcurity of time, and ſhines with everlaſting brightneſs. You find that MARCELLUS and many other heroes are ſtill remembered, as if they were but juſt dead; they ſacrificed their mortal part, that they might become immortal. The renown, which accompanied their laſt breath, ſeems to have perpetuated their duration; and where is the man of ſenſe and reflection, who would not be glad to ſhare their fate?</p>
                     <p>"IT is not enough, my children, to wear the livery of men of valour; to live in a corps, whoſe examples encourage bravery: Fortitude muſt be ingrafted in the heart; and it muſt be ſo diſintereſted, as neither to be influenced by eye-witneſſes, nor by the proſpect of reward.</p>
                     <p>"EXAMINE yourſelves on this head; and if your ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions unfortunately contradict your profeſſion, take ſhame to yourſelves, and know that you are no better than hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:029954_0021_0FE3816F86F547D0"/>
as to perſonal courage. It is the inward motive, not the outward appearance, which ſtamps a value upon actions: If in taking up arms we have more regard to our own intereſt, than to that of our Country, and if, under a pretence of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the rights of our King and Country, we think only of enriching ourſelves, we only wear the habit, without hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any portion of the ſpirit of a ſoldier. Many indeed have been found acting only under the influence of avarice and pride, at the very time that they ſignalized themſelves exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally by the moſt ſpecious conduct. But the true ſoldier deſires no other recompence, than the pleaſure of doing his duty; no other witneſs, than his own conſcience; he is juſt as ready to die in a crowd, wherein he will be mixed with the multitude, as to fall, diſtinguiſhed in a ſingle combat.</p>
                     <p>"THIS confidence is the effect of religion; which purifies the intentions, and influences the will, and is the ſchool of true magnanimity: Without the motives which religion offers, nothing is to be ſeen but the ſhadow of virtue. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is actuated by ſelf-intereſt, ſhould take care to conceal the principle on which he is acting: For the world, corrupt as it is, is not yet accuſtomed to applaud thoſe actions, which have no better principle than pride and covetouſneſs.</p>
                     <p>"YOU are deſcended from a line of anceſtors, whom your country ranks in the number of her heroes; their blood circulated in their veins for no other purpoſe, than that it might be ready to be ſhed, in order to oppoſe the miſchiefs which the enemy deviſed againſt the ſtate. With the price of their blood they purchaſed thoſe honours which you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit; and of which you then only properly avail yourſelves, when you imitate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="29" facs="unknown:029954_0021_0FE3816F86F547D0"/>
in pride and luxury, and gives us an air of arrogance and diſdain.</p>
                     <p>"IT is a certain indication of a weak and ungenerous mind, to imagine that a title gives us a right to deſpiſe the reſt of mankind, and to do whatever our paſſions may ſuggeſt to us. Nobility is at once both a recompence for paſt ſervices done to our country; and an engagement by which the party ſo diſtinguiſhed, binds himſelf to excel, not leſs in the dignity of his ſentiments, and the ſuperiority of his virtues, than in his rank and ſituation in the world.</p>
                     <p>"YOU can never therefore properly reflect on your noble birth, without being touched with a ſenſe of the duties which it requires of you. If your country gives you credit on account of your anceſtors; you ought to exert yourſelves to the utmoſt to diſcharge the debt, and do honour to their memory. From the firſt moment of your being, the world has expected that you ſhould be as great as your progenitors, and it is your duty to anſwer theſe expectations: Otherwiſe, the artiſan or the labourer will ſurpaſs you in the eyes of your country; and your titles and honours will only ſerve to make you contemptible.</p>
                     <p>"THE preſent age is not ſo barbarous, as to be ignorant, that all men are naturally equal; that all ought equally to labour; and that, if ſome are by the favour of their country diſtinguiſhed above others, it is only with a deſign to hold them up as patterns to the reſt of mankind. It is right, that there ſhould be, in every kingdom, perſons particularly called upon to vindicate the rights of honour and virtue: When we would kindle emulation in the minds of men, we muſt exhibit to them examples worthy of their imitation. What a ridiculous miſtake then i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

receive the title of nobility, as an encouragement to licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs and pride!</p>
                     <p>"IT is not a little pleaſing to find one's ſelf, in the midſt of ſo many different ranks and orders of men, particularly called upon to ſupport the character of generoſity and valour. This pleaſure is certainly worth all the trouble of expoſing ourſelves to any dangers, difficulties, or inconveniencies to which our profeſſion may be liable. True greatneſs conſiſts in being ready to reſign our claim to that honour which we well deſerve; and in generouſly reſolving never to be wanting to our King and Country, whatever we may be expoſed to, in the diſcharge of our duty. When you make your entrance on the theatre of the world, you muſt expect to be an eye-witneſs of the various ſcenes which it exhibits; and think, with MARCUS AURELIUS, that there is no part, however tragical, which you may not at one time or other be called upon to perform.</p>
                     <p>"THE more attentive you are to your duty, the more you will be expoſed to invidious cenſure: But it is then that you muſt ſeek for comfort in your own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>nd. Only make a point of doing what you ought; and then, whatever injury you ſuſtain, you will never be greatly diſconcerted. For this alſo is a proof of real magnanimity, to be ſuperior to all events; nay, in ſome caſes, even to hazard our reputation, while we are doing what we are convinced is right. It was thus, that FABIUS conducted himſelf; never altering his meaſures, notwithſtanding the murmurs occaſioned by the ſlow caution with which he acted. It is by no means im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that calumny and ingratitude ſhould be the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of your ſervices; but this you will utterly diſregard, whilſt your conſcience bears witneſs that you have diſcharged
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:029954_0022_0FE38176413AB280"/>
your duty; virtue is equally ſuperior both to the ſmiles and to the frowns of fortune.</p>
                     <p>"THE reaſon why ſo many perſons are found diſaffected towards government, is, becauſe their patriotiſm is really founded in ambition. They conſider only themſelves, while they pretend to have nothing in view but the publick good: And the leaſt diſappointment of their hopes leads them to rail againſt the conſtitution, and determines them no longer to ſtand forth in the ſervice of their country. May ſuch ſentiments as theſe never enter into your minds! May the publick welfare ſo engroſs your attention, as to make you regardleſs of your own! No man can ever be eſteemed poor, who can boaſt of the advantage of being ſerviceable to the nation to which he belongs.</p>
                     <p>"OBSERVE with what reſolution the common ſoldier ruſhes into the battle; who has no expectation of being diſtinguiſhed by a triumph, or of enlarging his fortune by conqueſt: He has nothing to expect but death. Learn from him that it is your duty to perform whatever is required of you, with firmneſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> without conſidering what may be the conſequence to yourſelf in particular.</p>
                     <p>"BUT to whatever advantage that perſon may appear, who is taught by his profeſſion only to eſtimate his life by the pleaſure of ſacrificing it, whenever his duty calls upon him to do it; yet will the brightneſs of his glory be entirely ſullied, if he is led to deſpiſe other ranks of men on the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon. He ought to be told, that our country is a body, which hath equal need of all its members; all of which co-operate in different ways for the general benefit. The ſtrength of a kingdom would be very ſoon exhauſted, if it could only be maintained by the ſword. The ploughſhare of
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:029954_0023_0FE3817C51BAE508"/>
the huſbandman, and the inſtrument of the loweſt mechanic, are the honourable means of ſerving their country; ſuch perſons cannot therefore be deſpiſed, without degrading hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity itſelf.</p>
                     <p>"I AM not here ſpeaking of Magiſtrates or Clergymen. You have no need to be told, that theſe functions (the one employed to preſerve an intercourſe betwixt heaven and earth, the other to maintain the peace and good order of families) are ſacred and venerable; and that it is a mark of ignorance or folly in either, to be inſenſible of their own dignity or util<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. How many of both theſe orders of men ſpend their whole lives in the diſcharge of their reſpective duties! They die with leſs eclat, I allow, than he who falls in the field of battle: But their death is ſo much more precious in the ſight of GOD, as it continued almoſt during their whole life: Every moment of which was a kind of diminution of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, through the continual waſting of their health and vigour.</p>
                     <p>"The generality of men, looking on perſons of diſtinction, ſee nothing but what ſerves to flatter their vanity, and excite the envy of their inferiors. But theſe are only ſuperfluities, with which a mind that is really great can never be affected: It is right that our country ſhould have rewards to beſtow, and it is natural for us to be pleaſed with receiving them; but we then ſhew they are unworthily beſtowed upon us, whenever we ſuffer them to miniſter to pride or luxury. Better were it to live in poverty and obſcurity, than to apply our riches and honours to the purpoſes of vanity. The more favours you have received from the hands of your country, the more ought you to ſtudy to be affable, modeſt, and induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious, in return for ſuch diſtinctions: Otherwiſe, you will expoſe her to the cenſures of the invidious, whoſe wiſdom

                     <p>HAVING, by the help of your father's invaluable manuſcript, inſtructed you in your duty to your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, I ſhall now proceed to thoſe obligations which you owe to ſociety. Affection ſupplies me with freſh ſpirits; and I willingly forget my own weakneſs, when your happineſs is concerned. My phyſicians indeed would fain diſſuade me from ſuch exertions of myſelf; but their apprehenſions only ſerve to quicken my zeal to diſcharge that office, which love and duty towards you inſpire.</p>
                     <p>THOUGH young, you already know enough of the world, to be ſenſible that there are connections ſuited to every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of life. And that, to confound the diſtinction betwixt each of theſe, would be equally contrary to the rules of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and diſcretion. In your choice of companions, regard muſt be paid to age, profeſſion, and fortune. This diſtinction is not the effect of ſcrupulous vanity, but the fruit of a wiſe diſcernment.</p>
                     <p>WHAT would you think of a man of quality, who ſhould only aſſociate with the vulgar? Would you not juſtly conſider him, as a contemptible character, and as one who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited the privileges of his birth and education? Providence has appointed diverſities of rank and condition, which we cannot confound without a violation of its laws: The cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of your birth were intended to teach you, that you ſhould connect yourſelves chiefly with perſons of your

own rank, or at leaſt with thoſe who diſtinguiſh themſelves by the worthineſs of their ſentiments. A ſimilitude of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and of inclinations, is the only ſure foundation of friendſhip among men.</p>
                     <p>SOCIAL intercourſe is not an arbitrary commerce with each other, with which we are at liberty to diſpenſe, AS we will, and WHEN we will: The ſeveral claſſes into which men are divided, are mutually bound to ſhew reſpect, and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and good will to one another. If regard is paid to your rank, you muſt, on your part, honour your ſuperiors: This diſtinction ſerves to maintain harmony in the world; and forms that interchange of true politeneſs, which cannot be too nicely preſerved.</p>
                     <p>HE who is really well-bred will ſhew reſpect to his inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, complaiſance to his equals, and condeſcenſion to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors: He will endeavour to accommodate himſelf to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent characters and circumſtances. You will never ſee ſuch a one running from one company to another, to carry tales, to broach new opinions, or to ſlander perſons behind their back. Always obliging, always a friend to truth, he well knows how to reconcile his language with his heart; and never ſays a word, which is inconſiſtent with decency or politeneſs. He is utterly unacquainted with the art of ſetting himſelf off at the expenſe of another: If he chooſes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge a vein of humour, it is only in ridiculing the follies of the age, without any perſonal reflections: If he chooſes to moralize, it is in ſo pleaſing a manner, that at once he both delights and perſuades.</p>
                     <p>THE ſafety as well as enjoyment of ſociety would be at an end, if every libertine might freely utter his obſcenities, and every atheiſt his blaſphemies; but good manners are a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity againſt ſuch offenſive diſcourſe: And even the moſt
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:029954_0025_0FE3818A19986DE0"/>
abandoned is obliged, in ſpite of himſelf, to conceal his vices, and aſſume the appearance of virtue. It is only in particular companies, equally reprobated by decency and good ſenſe, that we are inſulted by filthy jeſts; and the palm of wit is aſſigned to thoſe, who ridicule religion and its miniſters: Such company as this you ought never to be made acquainted with; true merit ſeeks a more advantageous reſidence, than in ſuch ſociety.

                     <p>THE greateſt miſchief is, when we do not diſtinguiſh betwixt the faſhion of the world, and the duties which we
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:029954_0025_0FE3818A19986DE0"/>
owe to ſociety; whereas there is a wonderful difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. The one engages us in a train of fooliſh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes, vicious intrigues, and a round of unprofitable idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the other makes us uſeful and friendly, and offers to us only thoſe amuſements which are innocent and proper.</p>
                     <p>A SOCIABLE man is really a friend to his country; a man of the world (in the ſenſe in which we have juſt now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered him) would ſacrifice his country to his intereſt and his pleaſures. When this attachment to the world has taken poſſeſſion of the heart, its votaries only exiſt for the ſake of gratification; and what dependence can there be on a mind that is ſubject to the tyranny of pleaſure?</p>
                     <p>HE, who attends to the duties which he owes to ſociety, is like a ſtream, which diffuſes itſelf through a beautiful meadow; but he, who gives himſelf up to the world, is like a torrent, which haſtens to empty itſelf into the ſea: In the one we diſcover nothing but delight, in the other nothing but noiſe a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I have been too well acquainted with this dangerous world; and it is becauſe I fooliſhly confounded it with ideas of ſociety, that I am at preſent ſo well able to diſtinguiſh betwixt them. Alas! I thought once, there was no being ſociable, without being preſent at every entertainment, at every play, and at every aſſembly; and I had ſo thoroughly recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled myſelf to this notion, that I ſhould have looked upon any one, as the moſt ſtupid and unſociable of all creatures, that did not readily concur with me in my ideas. So power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is the love of pleaſure, that it puts a falſe interpretation upon every thing, and aſſumes the language of folly inſtead of that of reaſon.</p>

                     <p>IT is my earneſt deſire, that my own paſt imprudence ſhould prove uſeful to YOU; and that you would not make SOCIETY conſiſt in any thing, but what it really is; that is to ſay, in a polite intercourſe, which unites us to each oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;—in friendly viſits, which cannot be diſpenſed with;—in letters of civility, which we ought to write;—and in that neceſſary familiarity, which we mutually ſtand in need of for the purpoſes of relaxation: All beyond this, deſerves not the name of SOCIETY.</p>
                     <p>AFTER determining, what it is to be really and properly ſociable; it is neceſſary for us to know, how we ought to conduct ourſelves in the company of others. Many rules have been laid down upon this ſubject; and they are plainly reducible to theſe: Never to ſpeak, but to the purpoſe: Never to rally, but with good humour: Never to appear ſupercilious: Never to indulge caprice: Never to ſhew any thing inconſiſtent with a good heart. Strokes of humour may pleaſe for a moment; but good ſenſe is always agreeable, and always gives ſatisfaction: We cannot endure that, which lets us down; and therefore we are much better pleaſed with him who only ſays common things, than with him whoſe turn of converſation is of a ſuperior kind: Nature is always pref<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable to art.</p>
                     <p>LEARN to make uſe of your wit, without ſhewing that you are vain of it; the leſs you affect to ſhew it, the more
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:029954_0026_0FE38191E32D7A58"/>
admirers you will find, and the more friends. Equally avoid both raillery and flattery; the one is always conſidered as ill-nature, the other paſſes for deceit. In former times it was neceſſary to praiſe in the moſt extravagant terms, in order to attract a ſmile, or even a gracious look: The ladies of the preſent age know how ridiculous ſuch commendations are; and rather than be diſguſted by flattery, they wiſh never to be complimented at all. If you are ſo happy as to have a grave and ſtudious turn; you will find fewer of theſe loſſer duties on your hands. All thoſe important trifles, which the world calls little attentions (though abſolutely neceſſary within proper limits) ſeem in their extreme to belong only to PETITS MAITRES; becauſe every thing, that is inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, is ſuited to that character. You are undone, if ever you propoſe ſuch as theſe for your examples. I never ſaw one of them, whoſe mind was not utterly ruined by his folly: They are fit only to afford diverſion, and they always do it at at their own expenſe. When the arrival of one of theſe gentry is announced, only by the ſcent of amber and muſk, and when he brings nothing with him but impertinence; it is impoſſible that any man of ſenſe can be pleaſed with ſuch company.</p>
                     <p>IT is by good manners and a genteel air, that others are prepoſſeſſed in our favour. Every man has ſo much ſelf-love, as to oppoſe him, who wiſhes to trample upon thoſe about him; we love to ſee the charms of ſweetneſs in a modeſt countenance: While you are poſſeſſed of theſe graces, my children, all the world will admire you. It is not neceſſary, in order to be ſociable, that you be eloquent, or witty, or poſſeſſed of any rare or ſuperior talents; all that ſociety de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of you is, that you be complaiſant without meanneſs, polite without flattery, ſteady without rudeneſs, and ſprightly
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:029954_0027_0FE381968C1D41E0"/>
without affectation. She requires that you cultivate her, as the friends of mankind; and that you do her honour by an unblemiſhed reputation, by decency in your words, and purity in your morals.</p>
                     <p>A FARTHER knowledge of the world will teach you many particulars, on which my weakneſs will not ſuffer me to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large. It will furniſh you with that gracefulneſs, that eaſe in your carriage, that politeneſs, that propriety of behaviour, which ought to diſtinguiſh a perſon of faſhion. It will ſhew you the neceſſity of not publiſhing ſtories without caution, of not judging of any performances but with modeſty; and of not ſpeaking of your neighbour's faults, but with reſerve. It will teach you that you ought to be neither the firſt to ſet the faſhion, nor the laſt to leave it; and in ſhort, that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not too carefully avoid the imputation of needleſs ſingularity.</p>
                     <p>BE careful not to ſlight any perſon; yet let your attentions be properly regulated: Nothing is more improper, than to treat a ſtranger with the intimacy of a friend; or an intimate friend with the diſtance due to a ſuperior. Diſtinguiſh merit wherever you find it, without troubling yourſelf about the garb in which it appears: Court the company of the learned, and the converſation of the aged; their diſcourſe is often more uſeful, than any book that you can read. Never argue on a ſubject, which you do not underſtand; every one admires modeſty; no one can endure conceit. If you are deſired to play for mere amuſement, do not decline it; but never play for the ſake of gain: If you are unlucky, you will loſe with good humour, when the ſtake is a matter of indifference: He, that cannot command his temper, never fails to diſcover his weakneſs, and gives offence to every one about him. Treat the female ſex with the utmoſt delicacy; they have a
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:029954_0027_0FE381968C1D41E0"/>
claim to the greateſt attention. Avoid intrigues; have a ſtrict regard to modeſty: And you will never have a quarrel with any woman.</p>
                     <p>NEVER promiſe any thing without deliberation; but having made a promiſe, implicitly obſerve it. Whoever joins the firſt party that comes in his way, without regarding a prior engagement, does not deſerve to have friends: Let diſcretion conſtantly direct your conduct. And if, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all theſe precautions, you ſhould meet with ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, they, and not you, will deſerve blame.</p>
                     <p>THE more attention you appear to ſhew to theſe inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, my children, the more dear you muſt neceſſarily be to me: and the leſs I ſhall lament the ſad ſeperation which death is preparing to make betwixt us. In leaving you well ſtored with good principles, and furniſhed with my beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, I ſhall think I only loſe you in part; and that I ſhall be always in ſome degree in the midſt of you. It is thus you will be able to find me in your own minds, when you can no longer ſee or hear me; and I truſt, you will there find me faithfully repreſented.</p>

                     <p>A SUCCESSION of fainting fits had exceedingly weakened this pious mother; but, by an exertion worthy of her virtue, and magnanimity, ſhe ſeemed to forget her bodily weakneſs, that ſhe might fully expreſs the dictates of her heart. Her children, full of attention, and impreſſed with the utmoſt tenderneſs, looked upon her
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:029954_0028_0FE3819EC5C510E8"/>
with a mixture of admiration and grief; while ſhe commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated this valuable leſſon of inſtruction on the ſubject of virtue.</p>
                     <p>VIRTUE, my children, ought to be the ruling principle of all your actions: I cannot but conſider her as the offspring of heaven, without whom there would be nothing in this world but iniquity and impurity. In vain have the moſt corrupt ages of men endeavoured to obſcure her brightneſs: She forces her way through the thickeſt cloud of paſſions; dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing thoſe rays of glory, which we never can ſufficiently admire. Even her enemies are compelled to praiſe her; and they who themſelves are wicked, if not utterly abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, would fain be accounted virtuous.</p>
                     <p>BUT it is not ſufficient to bear our teſtimony in favour of virtue, in empty words; we muſt do her honour by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct which is irreproachable. The eulogium, which we outwardly beſtow upon her, muſt be confirmed by the inward diſpoſitions of the heart. You will never be truly great, but in proportion as you are virtuous: The higheſt honours are no more than the pedeſtal; but merit is the ſtatue erected upon it. This it is, which diſtinguiſhes an individual from the multitude; this it is, which renders him ſuperior to all that birth and fortune can beſtow. Our talents do us hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; and wit gains us credit: But Virtue exalts us even above humanity; raiſing us above the events of life, and even above ourſelves. With her, we ſecure the admiration of poſterity: We live in the annals of hiſtory; we never die: Without her, on the contrary, we are degraded, we grovel, we only exiſt, to the diſhonour of humanity.</p>
                     <p>THOUGH ſhe has flouriſhed above 4000 years, ſhe is not yet grown old: We ſpeak of her, as if the great effects of her power were manifeſted even to this day. The ROMANS
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:029954_0028_0FE3819EC5C510E8"/>
are preſent with us, as though they were but juſt now dead; we ſeem as it were eye-witneſſes of their glory and magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity: So true is it, that —</p>
                     <p>HERE ſhe was obliged to break off her diſcourſe, that ſhe might not ſink under her extreme weakneſs; and ſhe had only juſt ſtrength enough left to tell her children, who were melted into tears, that ſhe muſt defer the remainder 'till another day.</p>

                     <p>FOUR days had now paſſed, within which this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent lady had not been able to converſe with her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; but happily her ſufferings abated, and ſhe now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed her inſtructions.</p>
                     <p>YOU ſee me, ſays ſhe, reſtored to you for a little time; and it is with the greateſt ſatisfaction I avail myſelf of this ſhort reſpite, from the pleaſing hope of rendering the few remaining hours of my life as uſeful to you as poſſible. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, of which I was ſpeaking, in my laſt conference with you, is ſo fruitful a field, that one might compoſe large volumes upon this ſubject. O! That I were able to rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſent her to you ſurrounded with that peace which is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to her, adorned with thoſe charms which diſtinguiſh her, ſupported by that true greatneſs, which is her characteriſtic! You would ſee that ſhe was formed to be the empreſs of the univerſe; that ſhe alone deſerves our regard; that her ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime perfections would have altars erected in every heart, if
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:029954_0029_0FE381A394923858"/>
man were not a dupe to his paſſions: the higher ſhe is raiſed, the more modeſt is her deportment; the more charms ſhe poſſeſſes, the more ſtudious is ſhe to conceal them.</p>
                     <p>IN vain doth vice oppoſe her attractions, and declare open war againſt her: The remorſe, which diſturbs the ſoul of every ſinner, comes to avenge her cauſe, and to teach us that there is no happineſs, but what is found in the poſſeſſion of Virtue. Attach yourſelves therefore cloſely to HER, and you will find that the perfection of happineſs conſiſts in the enjoyment of her. I never knew what real pleaſure was, 'till I became ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the worth of virtue, and the greatneſs of her beauty. As a proof of this, my deareſt children, I can with truth aſſure you, that notwithſtanding I am on all ſides ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with the ſhadow of death, I feel an inward joy which I am not able to expreſs. This is the preſent happy effect of my love for virtue; which has taken ſuch poſſeſſion of my heart, that nothing can materially affect me, which hath not ſome relation to HER: even You are only ſo far dear to me, as I truſt you will prove really good and virtuous.</p>
                     <p>THIS diſpoſition, however, is the gift of GOD, and cannot be derived from ourſelves alone; it is therefore the ſubject of my conſtant prayers, that you may be filled with that grace, which I have ſo often and ſo earneſtly implored for myſelf. No one will be richer than you, if you are in poſſeſſion of this treaſure; you can then be placed in no ſituation of life, in which you will not diſtinguiſh yourſelves by ſome laudable action. In each of you, the indigent will find a beneficent father; your family, an equitable and kind maſter; your relations, an affectionate and generous friend; your country, a zealous ſupporter; your king, a moſt faithful ſubject: In ſhort, all men will conſider you as their brethren, who only live to comfort and aſſiſt them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="45" facs="unknown:029954_0029_0FE381A394923858"/>WHAT a bleſſing will riches and honours prove in your hands, if you are really virtuous! You will then become a ſource of comfort, perpetually flowing to communicate hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to all mankind.</p>
                     <p>YOUR favour will be implored, as though ye were, in ſome degree, the miniſters of heaven; and men will bleſs you, as doing honour to the age and nation in which you live.</p>
                     <p>VIRTUE is far from being unrewarded even in this life. What a ſatisfaction do we feel, in awaking from ſleep, that we have in our will, and in our power to diſtinguiſh the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching day, by ſome act of mercy to the wretched! How are we delighted with ſuch ſentiments as theſe! What tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port doth the combination of ſuch virtues afford! Theſe are the never-failing attendants on good men.</p>
                     <p>YOU muſt however beware of confounding natural diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the dictates of virtue; we often miſtake conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional firmneſs, for heroic magnanimity: Vivacity of temper produces courage, as phlegm occaſions prudence. We can only know, by a ſtrict inquiry into ourſelves, the true motive on which we act. If it is really virtue which excites us, there will be neither affectation, nor ſeverity: Simplicity and moderation will every where appear. They, who carry things to an extreme, know not, that even wiſdom itſelf muſt be tempered with ſobriety.</p>
                     <p>I AM not fond of thoſe outrageous virtues, which certain enthuſiaſts recommend as the characteriſtics of human per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. True virtue only ſhews herſelf by a moſt obliging deportment; the more gracious her air is, the more ſtrongly ſhe engages our attachment: We are offended at the ſight of a countenance, which is overſpread with a cloud of ſeverity.</p>
                     <p>TAKE care then to exhibit nothing in your outward beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, but what is truly amiable; for otherwiſe you will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figure
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:029954_0030_0FE381AAF0D7FF70"/>
virtue, and make her appear different from what ſhe really is: All, that we add of our own, is only an alloy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of her purity. It is our misfortune that there is too great a want of ſincerity among us: Accuſtomed from our infancy to diſſemble, we think nothing excellent, but what is diſguiſed; whereas there is no virtue where there is no truth.</p>
                     <p>LAY this down as a maxim, and you will deteſt every ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of diſſimulation; there is nothing more odious, than a mind enſlaved to falſehood, a heart in which duplicity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails. It is better to ſpeak truth, though it ſhould prove to our own hurt, than to make uſe of the leaſt equivocation to gain the greateſt advantage.</p>
                     <p>ALL the riches in the world, are not worth one ſingle vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: So that if you were allowed to make your choice betwixt the wealth which you are to be poſſeſſed of, and the virtues which I have recommended to you to practiſe, you ought not to heſitate a moment, which of theſe you ſhould prefer. A man, who is truly virtuous, can never be really wretched. He finds in himſelf thoſe rich reſources, which even princes are unable to beſtow: Always patient and reſigned, he do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His thoughts are raiſed above the ſufferings of the preſent life, to the joys of a much happier ſtate; the ſublimity of his ſentiments renders him ſuperior to all the calamities, which fortune can inflict.</p>
                     <p>A SOUL, in which virtue reſides, is the neareſt repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of heaven itſelf: All is ſerenity, and light, and joy: The troubles of the world cannot interrupt its repoſe, the cloud of paſſions cannot diminiſh its brightneſs.</p>
                     <p>RELIGION is the only ſolid foundation of morality: This wiſdom is the chief ornament of the human mind, and the chief director of our life. Without this, the heart is degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:029954_0030_0FE381AAF0D7FF70"/>
the whole ſoul is degenerate; we are diſſatisfied with ourſelves, and we have only fools or libertines, for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions and friends.</p>
                     <p>ASK any man who has preferred a vicious to a virtuous courſe of life; and, if he is ſincere, he will acknowledge that his uneaſineſs was continual; that his joy was merely exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: That his imagination was bewildered; that his paſſions conſumed him; that his actions brutalized him; and that his whole mind and body were exhauſted.</p>
                     <p>WE need not wait for the coming of that awful day, when GOD ſhall puniſh vice, to know how odious ſhe is: Even in this life ſhe carries with her her own condemnation. Her moſt eloquent and bold panegyriſts, have never been able, with all their endeavours, to cover that deformity, which attends her; and always renders her th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>IN what ignominious terms doth hiſtory make mention of vicious princes! It ſpeaks of them with horror; and never ſo much as names them, but to make them odious to every age and nation.</p>

A man is always acting amiſs, when he is not virtuous; his conduct is a ſatire againſt himſelf: And he finds only mean and baſe minds, that will venture to applaud him.</p>
                     <p>WHILE we practiſe virtue, we belong, as it were, to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: While we lead a diſorderly life, we are retained in the ſervice of our paſſions. The obſervance of our duty unites us with good men; the love of vice throws us into the company of the wicked.</p>
                     <p>THE world will not fail to throw abundance of obſtacles in your way, to hinder your approach to virtue; but theſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties will preſently vaniſh, whenever you enter into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of your own hearts: You will then find, that it is impoſſible to be truly good, without all thoſe qualities, which religion demands; you will then find, that the inconſtancy of the human mind has need to be fixed by the authority of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and juſtice.</p>
                     <p>THE vivacity of youth is too apt to form a ſelfe idea of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as throwing a veil of melancholy over the world, and
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:029954_0031_0FE381B041733B28"/>
all its pleaſures. But ſuch young people are greatly miſtaken: Wiſdom and goodneſs are very conſiſtent with, if they are not indeed the only ſource of cheerfulneſs. If you look into the world, and attend carefully to the actions of men, you will find true enjoyment only among thoſe who are really vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous: Others indeed may APPEAR with more noiſy jollity about them; but this is only a kind of intemperate exceſs, which, in a few moments, will give place to an inſupportable melancholy. When a man is only joyous by fits and by compulſion, the heart remains a prey to diſſipation and remorſe.</p>
                     <p>IF what I have ſaid to you in recommendation of virtue, is not ſufficient to determine you in favour of her charms, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call to your minds your excellent father; review the hiſtory of your illuſtrious anceſtors! And by no means diſhonour their memory by a conduct ſo widely different from theirs. The life which you derive from them, ſhould paſs as incorrupt as theirs: You ought to bear their name, only that you may ſhew to poſterity, that you are ſo many living repreſentatives of their virtues.</p>
                     <p>I flatter myſelf, my admonitions will not eaſily be effaced; and that you will ſtudy that moderation in all things, which conſtitutes true wiſdom. Your minds will never be truly great, except whilſt, being ſteady without boldneſs, prudent without avarice, liberal without profuſion, you ennoble every action of your lives. Take heed that you do not, even in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, diveſt yourſelves of that prudence and caution which you outwardly profeſs; you muſt never forget, that you ought to be virtuous, for the ſake of Virtue, and for the ſake of Heaven. A truly good man is he, who acts, as if his whole conduct was open to the ſight and examination of GOD and men.</p>

                     <head>CONFERENCE VII. ON PLEASURE.</head>
                     <p>AS GOD, my dear children, is pleaſed to prolong my life, and to enable me to continue my inſtructions to you; I ſhall take this opportunity of dwelling more at large on the ſubject of Pleaſure; the chief rock againſt which you are in danger of ſplitting. Youth is the ſeaſon, in which pleaſures preſent themſelves to the imagination, to ſeduce and captivate it. They begin by dazzling our ſight; and when once they have ſucceeded in this point, they ſoon aſſume the empire of the heart: There they eſtabliſh their dominion, and choke every ſeed of virtue.</p>
                     <p>AS ſoon as the inordinate love of pleaſure takes poſſeſſion of the ſoul, virtue is obliged to retire; we are thenceforth wholly taken up with ſuch objects as gratify the paſſions, cheriſh effeminacy, and ſupport vanity: We ſeek for nothing but miſchievous indulgencies, we liſten only to the dictates of our ſenſual appetites.</p>
                     <p>THERE is no man, who is not fond of eaſe and tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: This principle is ſo deeply imprinted in our minds, that we muſt diveſt ourſelves of our nature, before we can think otherwiſe. But by TRANQUILLITY OF MIND<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I mean that pure ſatisfaction, which has nothing in common with thoſe gratifications, in which the world chiefly delights: For you cannot be too often told, that the pleaſures which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues, as its ſovereign good, are only phantoms which miſlead us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="51" facs="unknown:029954_0032_0FE381BC129E4410"/>I AM no ſtranger to theſe boaſted delights: I have been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently engaged in their vain purſuit; and from my own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience I can with truth declare, that they only ſerve to lull reaſon to ſleep. It is, in ſhort, a ſtate of ſtupefaction, which terminates in remorſe; a dream, from which, when we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, we find a VACUUM, which we are not able to ſupply. I always fancied, that they would fill my heart with the moſt perfect joy; and I found myſelf conſtantly diſappointed.</p>
                     <p>THOUGH the ſoul drink ever ſo largely of this cup, it nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er finds that inward ſatisfaction, which leaves nothing further to be deſired: We never can be completely happy, whilſt we are under the government of our paſſions.</p>
                     <p>IF I had time and ability to analyze thoſe pleaſures to which the world is enſlaved, I could demonſtrate to you the inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of public diverſions and amuſements, to give real ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a rational mind. It is ſufficient to know that they are trifling, that they are fatiguing, that they are tranſient; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the ſoul can find no real happineſs in that, which is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial, peaceful, and unchangeable. We always therefore of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer violence to our better part, when we launch forth into that tumultuous ocean of trifles, which conſtitute the life of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of faſhion. It is only by ſtifling reflection, that the lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of pleaſure can ſupport themſelves: they well know that a little ſerious conſideration would give them a diſtaſte for the pleaſures which they are purſuing, and therefore they do every thing they can to get rid of it. Thus do they live in a wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>norance even of their own minds.</p>
                     <p>HOW often does the theatre, which we are fond of calling the ſchool of true politeneſs and juſt ſentiments, carry us away from ourſelves, and render us the ſlaves of paſſion! It is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally love, which performs the principle character, and which
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:029954_0033_0FE381C0E03E5178"/>
is repreſented in the moſt alluring manner: We ſeldom attend, I believe, to what is paſſing there, without returning more enamoured with the world, more paſſionately fond of dreſs, more ſtrongly inclined to diſſipation. The glaring appearance of the ſtage, the ſentiments there delivered, and the objects exhibited, all ſerve to enchant the ſenſes, excite the paſſions, intoxicate the mind, and encourage the love of pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>THINK not, I aſſume the language of a preacher; mine is only that of reaſon and experience. The theatre is very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the ruin of young men, whom the ſight of an actreſs ſeduces, and carries headlong into every ſpecies of miſchief. From that moment, all domeſtic attachments are at an end; all relative duties are neglected; a total diſorder in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs ſucceeds, and they become the ſubject of public conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and the authors of ruin to themſelves and to their families.</p>
                     <p>I DEFY the advocates for theſe entertainments to deny the facts, juſt mentioned. Alas! what I have ſaid is too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly verified, to queſtion the truth of it. In vain are we told, that the tears, which we ſhed in the theatre, teach us to be compaſſionate; the momentary tenderneſs, excited by ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, ſeldom, if ever, materially affects the heart. Some, who are juſt come from a ſcene, at which they were almoſt diſſolved into tears, could with dry eyes behold the wretch, who, in want of every comfort, implores their pity and relief.</p>
                     <p>ASSEMBLIES have ſo often proved the occaſions of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues and duels, that I cannot venture to recommend them to you. It is certainly very proper, that a young man of faſhion ſhould know how to introduce himſelf, at ſuch places; and particularly that he ſhould be able to dance gracefully. But it is alſo alſo very neceſſary, that he ſhould know, that
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:029954_0033_0FE381C0E03E5178"/>
of all qualifications, dancing is the leaſt conſiderable: That a man of ſcience looks on it with an eye of pity; and that an officer ought neither too curiouſly to ſtudy it, nor too earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engage in it: It is the property of perſons of a trifling cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, to be wholly occupied by trifles.</p>
                     <p>AS to play; there is no ſpecies of it, which does not ſtand in need of ſome apology to excuſe it. At beſt, it ſhews a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of mind, which is incapable of proper application; and occaſions a loſs of time which it is impoſſible to redeem: You muſt never conſider it, but as a neceſſary recreation, and an act of civility which you owe to ſociety. But lay this down as a maxim, that the money, which we win, ſeldom does us the leaſt good; and that the loſs of our money ſeldom fails to diſconcert us.</p>
                     <p>OF games of hazard I ſay nothing; they are ſo dangerous that I am perſuaded you will moſt carefully avoid them: In theſe, men either loſe their reputation, or their fortune, or both. And however rich they may ſuppoſe themſelves; from the moment they commence gameſters, they can never inſure their being worth a ſhilling: A ſingle throw often reduces an opulent man to abſolute beggary.</p>
                     <p>I AM, perhaps, wrong, in reckoning play in the number of pleaſures; it certainly has much more the appearance of ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, than of recreation. The eyes fixed, the attention engroſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a deep ſilence, a reſtleſs inquietude ariſing from the fear of loſing or the hopes of gain, exclude the moſt diſtant idea of pleaſure. This is the ſtate of all who loſe. They are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> of complaints, they torment themſelves; and when they are ſeen PLAYING, to ſay the truth, they do every thing but PLAY.</p>
                     <p>AS for feaſts: They are only our ordinary meals, embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by elegance and a variety of meats. They may ſerve to
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:029954_0034_0FE381C8B4B10380"/>
remind us, that this body of ours is a ſlave, that has a great many wants to be ſupplied, and that all theſe kinds of food, with which our vanity is fed, were originally deſigned merely for a remedy againſt death. It is a ſure indication of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate mind, when any man makes his happineſs to conſiſt in the pleaſure of eating.</p>
                     <p>DO not imagine, my dear children, that I have the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of making you unſociable, or moroſe. My intention is only to inſpire you with elevated ſentiments; to teach you the true value of things; that you may not miſtake tinſel for gold; but that you may uſe this world as not abuſing it: And that you may be aſſured, that a conſcientious diſcharge of your duty, is the only ſource of real pleaſure; that to reach forth comfort to the miſerable gives the trueſt ſatisfaction; and furniſhes the mind with that enjoyment, which no enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments or diverſions can afford.</p>
                     <p>CAN there be a more pitiable object than one whoſe whole happineſs depends on a fox chace, a concert, or a play? Should either of theſe fail him, he is undone: Or, if by chance he ſhould be ſo circumſtanced, as to be out of the reach of them, he is ſo miſerable, that his exiſtence is a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to him.</p>
                     <p>WHO, on the contrary, is more happy than he who, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with the means of amuſing ſolitude, can ſit down and reliſh the pleaſures of reading and contemplation? Such a man goes out into the world merely for recreation, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the duties which he owes to ſociety: He conſiders the public amuſements as incidental means of relaxation; but can never be induced to ſet his heart on ſuch uſeleſs trifles.</p>
                     <p>AS your military life may often oblige you to live in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries very ill ſupplied even with common neceſſaries, you muſt accuſtom yourſelves to be well ſatisfied, wherever you are. In
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:029954_0034_0FE381C8B4B10380"/>
order to which, reflect, that the mind is the principal object, which deſerves your attention; and that if you cultivate the growth of virtue in your hearts, you will have within your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a never failing ſource of ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>THE diverſions of the field are certainly amuſing; the charms of muſic are unqueſtionably great; but our attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to either, falls little ſhort of madneſs, if we ſuffer them to engroſs our whole time, or our beſt affections. It is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, which muſt give a reliſh even to our pleaſures; and which alone renders them worthy of a rational ſoul. When we would be always amuſed, we loſe the idea of amuſement; even what is moſt delicious becomes inſipid, by being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly within our reach. Every thing grows dull to that heart, which is a prey to voluptuouſneſs; every unneceſſary refinement made uſe of to whet the appetite for pleaſure, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a painful ſatiety. If you only conſider recreation, as the remedy of fatigue, it will be very eaſy to find amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Studied pleaſures are only for thoſe, whoſe appetites are in a manner exhauſted.</p>
                     <p>AS you are now arrived at an age, in which your paſſions begin to ſhew themſelves; guard with the utmoſt care againſt every thing which may corrupt your morals, or diſturb your tranquillity. Youth is the torrid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ne of life; and the irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar love of women the ſource of inquietude and misfortunes. Hiſtory abounds with inſtances of thoſe ravages which it is continually making: It preſents itſelf to us under the attractive idea of pleaſure; but it ſoon becomes a torment, which diſorders the imagination, diſtracts the mind, and tyrannizes over the heart.</p>
                     <p>WHOEVER is thoroughly ſubject to its power, is always ready to violate the moſt ſacred duties: He forgets his friends,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:029954_0035_0FE381CE12903E38"/>
his country, and his GOD; he ſees nothing but the object of his paſſion; he hearkens to nothing but the voice of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled deſires.</p>
                     <p>IN this dreadful ſituation you will be ſure to find your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if you know not how to fill up your time in a proper manner. The paſſions muſt be ſubdued by the ſtubbornneſs of labour; and temptation muſt be reſiſted, by avoiding the occaſions of it: We are ſure of being loſt, whenever we ſeek for danger. The miſeries of luſt may be read in the very faces of thoſe, who give themſelves up to it. Nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſts and enervates like debauchery; it deſtroys at once the underſtanding and the health.</p>
                     <p>YOU will tell me, perhaps, that by my ſyſtem of morality ALL pleaſures are forbidden: No, my children, there are many recreations, which virtue allows; and in which you will find ſufficient ſatisfaction, when you only ſeek them for the ſake of amuſement.</p>
                     <p>A SOCIAL game at cards, cheerful converſation, an even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing walk, an intereſting book, a game at tennis, or a day's hunting, a dinner with your friends, and innocent mirth— theſe ſhould be your amuſements. And theſe will have charms enough, if you know the nature of true pleaſure; I mean that, which is not purchaſed with pain or remorſe; and which, leaving the mind at all times in the ſame eaſy ſtate in which it found it, is under no apprehenſion of ſhame, nor fears the cenſures of mankind.</p>
                     <p>IF a libertine would venture to calculate all the difficulties and embarraſſments, which he is under, to diſguiſe his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct from the eyes of men, and to conceal his ſhame from his parents or his friends, he would ſee that his life is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual torment: And that the wretched privilege of ruining
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:029954_0035_0FE381CE12903E38"/>
his conſtitution, and deſtroying his life, is purchaſed with endleſs vexations. In vain does he ſhelter himſelf from the reproaches of men; GOD ſees him and his crimes, in the very moment of commiſſion; and they are written in that everlaſting book, in which all our actions are recorded.</p>
                     <p>FREQUENTLY reflect, I beſeech you, on what I have ſaid; and you will find, that true ſatisfaction conſiſts only in an upright attention to your duty. A mind ſo compoſed will receive pleaſure even from a ſight of a flower beginning to diſcloſe its beauties, or from a murmuring ſtream; or even from viewing the formation of the ſmalleſt inſect. A reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mind improves every contemplation of the wonderful works of the Creator; it finds numberleſs beauties in thoſe objects, which paſs unnoticed by perſons of a diſſipated turn.</p>
                     <p>WHAT delight is the proſpect of a flowery meadow capable of affording to a mind unſullied by vice! What ſatisfaction does a tender and a virtuous heart feel, from the conſcious ſenſe of a good action! Such as theſe are the pleaſures, which I wiſh you to experience: We are always independent, when we have the reſources of entertainment within ourſelves. He, who is always running about in ſearch of happineſs, ſeldom finds any thing more than the ſhadow of it.</p>
                     <p>LET your minds then open themſelves to the pleaſures, which virtue offers to your acceptance; and think, that, as effeminacy is the parent of chagrin, you will no longer be able to ſupport yourſelves than while you are fond of labour, and know how to diverſify it. This variety tends admirably to hinder diſtaſte; nothing being ſo tedious as an uniform ſame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of employment.</p>
                     <p>WHILST you carefully avoid the company of libertines, I am ſure you will be ſafe; but if once you aſſociate with them, you will infallibly become a prey to vice: Their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:029954_0036_0FE381D66FCB7558"/>
tends only to ſeduce, and their examples are infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious. Accuſtomed to receive, from the moſt plauſible writers, whatever can inſpire them with the love of pleaſure; they praiſe, extol, and recommend them wherever they go; as a cloud ſcatters hail, or rain, over every country through which it paſſes.</p>
                     <p>I AM ſenſible that you have need of reſolution. But what is a man, that is driven about with every wind? Who can be good with ſuch as are good, and a libertine with ſuch as are diſſolute; in ſhort, who has no inclinations or purpoſe of his own. If you think my advice tends only to render your life melancholy; you will neither do juſtice to my affection, nor to my diſcernment. Adopt the meaſures which I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend; and you will very ſoon know, by experience, that as your happineſs is the only earthly object of my care; ſo I am neither miſtaken in the end, nor in the means which I point out to you, of effecting it. The voice of a mother, ſo deeply intereſted as I am in your welfare, is not the voice of treachery. Death, approaching, begins to open my eyes; and imparts to me new rays of light: It deſtroys indeed my bodily ſtrength, but it increaſes the powers of my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. It redoubles my love of thoſe, whom I conſider as a part of myſelf, which will ſoon ſurvive me; and, as it were, ſecure to me a continuance on that earth, on which I ſhall no longer perſonally exiſt.</p>
                     <p>IF any thing can afford me comfort in death, it will be the confidence, that you will conſcientiouſly obſerve my precepts. Promiſe me, therefore, my beloved children, with ſuch expreſſions as a ſenſe of duty will ſuggeſt; promiſe me on the truth of a ſoldier, whoſe word of honour is moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred; promiſe me that you will conform your lives to the rules which I have here laid down, and that you will
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:029954_0036_0FE381D66FCB7558"/>
not diſhonour my memory by an irregular and vicious conduct.</p>
                     <p>HERE the children of our excellent mother caſt themſelves at her feet: And in the midſt of tears and ſighs proteſted, that their lives ſhould be exactly ſuch, as ſhe had marked out to them; and that they had rather die in her preſence, than make her ſuch promiſes, as they did not mean to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. Each of them embraced her in the tendereſt manner; after which the generous parent finiſhed her conference by ſaying, in a ſteady, but interrupted tone of voice—</p>
                     <p>I RECEIVE your protection with the utmoſt comfort: I would make it known, that it might be a witneſs againſt you, if you ſhould ever counteract your own ſolemn engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The world, corrupt as it is, would then ſhew, that it has virtue enough to ſet itſelf againſt you, and vindicate my rights: But in ſo doing, I ſhould think I diſhonoured you by my unjuſt apprehenſions. Only remember, that no one, without GOD'S aſſiſting grace, can attain to any thing which is good; and that you ſtand in need of ſuccour from Heaven, to enable you to put in practice what you have promiſed.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE never been able to read the hiſtory of thoſe wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people without horror; who, to ſatisfy their inordinate deſires, have effected the utter ſubverſion of a whole nation, and feaſted their eyes and their hearts with the dreadful ſpectacle. They are monſters, which deſerved to have been buried in oblivion: Hiſtory ought not even to have tranſmitted their names to our remembrance. Immortality is the reward of virtue alone; as for wickedneſs, it is worthy to be conſigned to that darkneſs, whence it proceeded.</p>
                     <p>THERE is a kind of ambition, which we call emulation; and which, having nothing in its view but the public good, or its own advancement, according to the ſtricteſt rules of equity and honour, muſt needs be conſidered as a virtue. Without this ſpecies of ambition, our faculties would be benumbed, our talents would remain buried; there would be no enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, or diſcovery in the world: Men, reduced to a level with the brute creation, would live without rule and without reaſon.</p>
                     <p>IT was the deſign of Providence, that our own private inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt ſhould be intimately connected with that of the public; and that the general good ſhould be promoted by the exertion of each man's particular abilities. Every one ſeems to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring for himſelf; and yet this labour, though SELF ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be the immediate object, ſoon unites with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:029954_0037_0FE381DBF1265238"/>
maſs of induſtry: And thus is compoſed that uſeful body of men, who maintain the ſtrength and magnificence of the ſtate, at the hazard of their lives, or by the ſweat of their brows.</p>
                     <p>WE are no where forbidden to keep our own advancement in our view; but we are at all times required to prefer the public good before our private intereſt: And while we are leſs concerned about our own advantage, than about that of our country, we ſhall never deſire any thing, but what is juſt and reaſonable. When either arrogance or avarice ſo far prevails, as to make us with to appropriate to ourſelves the praiſes and rewards, which are not our due, we then become uſurpers, and ceaſe to be worthy citizens.</p>
                     <p>AMBITION is a paſſion, which runs into every extreme: One while it debaſes him, who is enſlaved to it; at another time it exalts him above meaſure: It is the parent of pride on one hand, and of meanneſs on the other. Of this ſort are thoſe obſequious wretches, who bow themſelves at the feet of ſuch as are able to promote them; while they treat thoſe with contempt, from whom they have nothing to expect.</p>
                     <p>WE muſt be well acquainted with the ambitious, if we would be competent judges of the miſeries they endure. We ſhould then ſee what variety of projects, what a ſucceſſion of uneaſineſſes, fills their imagination: How their minds are diſtracted with hopes and fears; how continually they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded with the phantom of glory, which ſuddenly vaniſhes away; and which makes the ambitious man think himſelf perpetually on the brink of happineſs, without ever actually attaining to it. Scarce is one of his deſires gratified, when a ſecond preſents itſelf: His heart, like the veſſel of the DANAIDES, can never be filled; he is like another TAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TALUS,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:029954_0038_0FE381E4654A0D10"/>
whoſe thirſt is never to be quenched. What a lamentable ſtate is this!</p>
                     <p>WHETHER it is the deſign of Providence to ſtop the ambitious in his career, or whether he is exhauſted by his own deſires; I have ſeen a multitude of young people, hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away by this paſſion, periſh in the midſt of their projects of grandeur and advancement. Alas! will there not be earth enough to ſupply us with a grave; and muſt we be inceſſantly reminded, that this life is ſo ſhort and tranſitory, that there is not time to form deſigns, and to ſee them exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted?</p>
                     <p>IT ſhould ſeem, that the honours with which men feed their imagination, muſt needs be eternal; and yet—a ſingle moment is ſufficient to put an end both to them and their poſſeſſors. The earth is covered with inſcriptions, which announce the tranſitory condition of human grandeur: We ſpend our whole lives in deſiring that promotion, at which we never arrive; or, at leaſt, not before the eve of death. Truly it was well worth our while, to torment ourſelves night and day, about what is ſo full of uncertainty, and of ſo ſhort duration!</p>
                     <p>THERE is only one ſort of ambition, which I can venture to recommend to you; that of imitating your anceſtors, and of ſerving your country with a zeal which nothing can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh. In every thing elſe, let moderation ſet bounds to your deſires: He is worthy of every thing, who thinks he deſerves nothing.</p>
                     <p>THEY who are continually complaining of the injuſtice done them, becauſe their merit is not properly attended to, are men of a moſt ignoble ſpirit: We adopt a very different language, when we feel in our minds that generoſity of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:029954_0038_0FE381E4654A0D10"/>
which raiſes us above the caprice of fortune. The mere ſatisfaction of having honourably ſerved the public, is of more value, than every kind of recompence. We muſt put ourſelves in a ſituation to hope for every thing from Heaven; this will prove the beſt ground of comfort, amidſt all the injuſtice of men.</p>
                     <p>I SHOULD be very miſerable, if I thought you could only riſe, by means of intrigue. Shew on all occaſions a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous greatneſs of mind, which raiſes you above all the little artifices, and baſe compliances, which ambition ſtudies. Habituate yourſelves to deſire no other advancement, than that which may ariſe from the performance of your duty; chooſe rather to live in obſcurity, than to ſhine with a bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed luſtre. If we would be really honoured by the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties conferred on us, we muſt never be aſhamed to declare, by what means we attained to the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>: True honour conſiſts not ſo much in obtaining promotion, as in having deſerved it. Thoſe titles, with which a man of faſhion is diſtinguiſhed, no longer afford him any real ſatisfaction than while they are confirmed by the public approbation.</p>
                     <p>IF you love the truth, as I truſt you always will, you will be utter ſtrangers to flattery and duplicity; but you muſt expect in return, that fortune, who beſtows the chief of her favours on compliance and deceit, will not reckon you in the number of her favourites. You will then be great, only in the way which is proper for you; true glory will never leave you. You will find, in yourſelves, thoſe honours and riches, which are not to be found in courts; and you will have this ſatisfaction, that neither injuries nor death itſelf will be able to take any thing from you.</p>
                     <p>IT is time for you, my children, to ſhew to the world an example of true magnanimity: The hearts of too many are
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:029954_0039_0FE381E9E43A5E48"/>
ſo debaſed, that they only think how they may arrive at honours, without concerning themſelves whether the means are generous and lawful. Envy, which always forms an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere round virtuous characters, will perhaps conſider you as proud; but what doth calumny avail, againſt a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience void of offence? It is then we wrap ourſelves up in our integrity; and are contented to defy malevolence Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever reſolutely devotes himſelf to the practice of virtue, will not fail to have enemies; ſo invariably is it the lot of real merit to be perſecuted, that it is laid down as an axiom, that it muſt be ſo.</p>
                     <p>IT is not ſufficient to be poſſeſſed of military courage. You muſt have a ſtrength of mind, which extends itſelf to every part of your conduct; which raiſes you above all the rumours of malice and envy; which makes you deſpiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports and cabals; and which renders you invulnerable to the ſhafts of ingratitude and revenge.</p>
                     <p>DO not imagine that, under the pretext of elevating your minds, I wiſh ſo to debaſe them, as to make you indifferent to every inſult which may be offered to you: All I have to ſay on ſo delicate a ſubject, is, that your own prudence muſt be your chief defence. By being affable and well-bred, you will avoid thoſe dreadful rencounters, in which we know what we ought to do, but do not know what we ſhall be compelled to do.</p>
                     <p>WHATEVER may happen to you, never forget, that every ſubject owes his life to his king and country; and that YOU doubly owe your's, both as citizens and ſoldiers. You are appointed by the ſtate as centinels, to watch in its defence; the preſervation therefore of your own lives is a neceſſary part of your duty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="65" facs="unknown:029954_0039_0FE381E9E43A5E48"/>IF a trial muſt be made of your perſonal courage, war will furniſh you with abundant opportunities of ſhewing it. You never will be accuſed of want of bravery, whilſt you are ſeen the laſt in a retreat, and the foremoſt to engage; it is in ſuch ſituations, that a noble ambition ought to influence your conduct. When you have only deſires of this kind, virtue will ſecure them, and crown them with bleſſing and good ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>THE duties of a ſoldier are the propereſt to excite emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they never want opportunities to diſtinguiſh themſelves. Even peace furniſhes them with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Let merit alone ſpeak in your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half; and leave it to thoſe who wiſh you well, to give it its proper weight. Your attendance at court will not then be irkſome to you; and courtiers will not look upon you with a jealous eye. As you will not have any pretenſions, you will have no inducement to act a part; and this ſimplicity and eaſe being ſomething uncommon, will perhaps more ſtrongly recommend you than diſſimulation. We had once an <note n="*" place="bottom">Colbert.</note> ambaſſador, who ſurprized thoſe of every other court; and obtained every thing he wanted, by always ſpeaking the truth.

They will convince you, that it is not from the republick of PLATO, that I derive theſe admonitions; and that you will never be truly happy, but when you reduce them into practice. Follow after virtue; make a grateful return for the love which I have ſhewn you; honour your mother, liſten to her inſtructions: And remember, that there are no people upon earth, with whom the advice of a dying parent is not accounted as ſacred as an oracle.</p>

You would have found in the ſtrength of his underſtanding, and in the greatneſs of his ſentiments, every thing that is capable of improving and perfecting your own.

                     <head>CONFERENCE IX. <hi>On</hi> GENEROSITY.</head>
                     <p>I HAVE often thought that amidſt all the different modes of educating young people, they have never been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently inſtructed in the nature of true Generoſity. To ſupply this defect, I intend to ſhew you, that there is nothing which raiſes us to a nearer reſemblance to the Deity, than the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this duty. We become imitators of that Providence, which diſpenſes its bounty with profuſion; and we reſemble thoſe beneficial clouds, which diſtil plenty on every part of the earth.</p>
                     <p>THE ſpendthrift is as far from generoſity as the miſer: They are both of them beings, who have nothing in view but their own gratifications, without any regard to the neceſſities of their neighbour. The one throws his money away, and the other locks it up; but miſery receives no conſolation from either. There is no virtue, where there is neither diſcretion, nor any regard for the public good: Whatever has nothing better than vanity for its principle, is certainly far from being worthy of praiſe.</p>
                     <p>WHAT indeed would become of us, if our ſentiments were wholly under the influence of caprice! Nothing but folly and ſingularity would be found among men; and that attention to the public welfare, which ought to direct our ſentiments and conduct, would inſenſibly come to nought. It is the law of prudence and of reaſon, which determines the uſe we ought to make of our talents and abilities; and it is only in following this law, that we advance towards perfection, and do honour to humanity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="68" facs="unknown:029954_0041_0FE381F740CA54E0"/>RICHES are either an honour, or a diſgrace, to thoſe who poſſeſs them; it is a real misfortune to be rich, when we know not how to uſe our riches. I had infinitely rather leave you in a ſtate of indigence, than know, that you were either covetous or extravagant. Avarice renders us the objects of public indignation; prodigality carries us headlong into a thouſand difficulties. It is generoſity alone, which obſerves the happy medium betwixt both; which renders us worthy partakers of earthly and heavenly bleſſings; provided it is the work of the heart, and not the effect of humour or oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation.</p>
                     <p>WHAT delight does it afford one, to ſee a generous noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who, giving every thing to beneficence, and nothing to vanity, finds reſources in frugality, for the ſupply of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of his friend, the aſſiſtance of an indigent widow, or the conſolation of the unfortunate! Such a ſight as this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes itſelf to the heart; and with a power ten thouſand times more affecting than any theatrical repreſentation, awakens all the ſenſibility of the ſoul, and raiſes it above hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity itſelf.</p>
                     <p>EXHIBIT to the world, my dear children, ſuch a character as this; conſecrate a part of your income to the benefit of your diſtreſſed fellow-creatures. Let your liberality extend it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, wherever the miſeries of others are urgent; adapt your bounty to the different degrees of wretchedneſs: When cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances demand it, be generous according to the extent of your ability, and the exigency of the caſe.</p>
                     <p>TRUE generoſity conſiſts in giving with propriety: The manner of diſpenſing is oftentimes more pleaſing than the gift itſelf. A man, who gives with an ungracious air, deſtroys all the merit of his benefaction: If you would oblige by your generoſity, you muſt ſhew the party whom you ſerve, that you
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:029954_0041_0FE381F740CA54E0"/>
think it more bleſſed to give than to receive. A liberal man ſets a greater value on gold, chiefly becauſe it enables him to relieve the neceſſitous.</p>
                     <p>I HAVE often ſeen your father give large ſums of money to the truly diſtreſt; and perceived that he was more delighted with ſuch an act, than he could have been by any favour conferred upon himſelf. He felt, in his heart, that there is no ſatisfaction equal to the pleaſure of obliging others. Oh! if he were now inſtructing you in my ſtead, with what earneſtneſs of affection would he encourage you to adopt his ſentiments, and imitate his practice! How often hath the generous tear of pity fallen from his eyes, at the ſight of a miſerable object! Many a time has he led me to the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the wretched, to teach me a proper regard for the poor, and to excite my deſire to comfort them. He ſought the company of ſuch as needed relief; he converſed freely with them as with brethren: He became a party in their ſufferings by a friendly ſympathy, and filled their hearts with conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and joy.</p>
                     <p>SO bright an example muſt needs engage your reverence and imitation. You are under the ſtrongeſt obligations to ſhew thoſe perſons, who have experienced the goodneſs of your father, that his virtues have deſcended to you, and that you are not degenerate: Otherwiſe, you will only be deſpiſed, and will be conſidered as unworthy of that inheritance which he has left you.</p>
                     <p>YOU live in an age, wherein luxury dries up the ſource of liberality: That we may give full ſcope to our vanity, we have nothing left for the relief of miſery. We do not inquire, how much we can ſpare for acts of mercy; but what will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us to gratify our paſſion for the moſt expenſive pleaſures? As for generoſity, it paſſes with ſome for a romantic virtue:
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:029954_0042_0FE381FE20AEED98"/>
and yet I will venture to aſſure you, that it is as eſſential to a man of quality as courage; and that it even makes a part of honeſty itſelf.</p>
                     <p>YOU will never be truly great, but ſo long as greatneſs is the principle of your actions. Every thing is little in a noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who is not generous: His ideas are little, his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are mean. The ſoul grows narrow and confined, when we are thinking only of oeconomy; we muſt know how to ſpend, and how to give.</p>
                     <p>GENEROSITY is a virtue, which foreſees evil, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to prevent it; which embraces every opportunity of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, and is awakened by the firſt complaint of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable. Liſten only to her dictates, and you will liberally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence thoſe who ſerve you; you will be ready to lend, and will know no greater ſatisfaction, than when you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving your neighbour. It is ſhocking, to ſee men prefer ſo worthleſs a poſſeſſion as money, before the life of their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or to ſee them make uſe of their riches, only to feed their vanity and pride. I had rather your houſe were without furniture, and your wardrobe without clothes; than that you ſhould be inſenſible of the miſeries of the poor. But gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eroſity, which runs not to ſuch exceſs, and is duly mindful of meaſure and proportion, will ſuggeſt to you the means of rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onciling what you owe to your rank, with what you owe to your neighbour: It will give order to your domeſtic affairs, and an air of greatneſs to all your actions: So as to enable you to be oeconomical, and yet magnificent on proper occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
                     <p>ABRIDGE yourſelves as much as poſſible of thoſe ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities, which the world eſteems faſhionable; To be the ſlave of vanity and folly, argues a weak and puſillanimous
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:029954_0042_0FE381FE20AEED98"/>
ſpirit. A ſoldier is not allowed to be ſubject to thoſe trifles, which engroſs the attention of a PETIT MAITRE: Nothing is more incompatible with the indulgencies of luxury and pride, than a military life; nor does any thing better ſupport the dignity of that character, than a noble, unaffected exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal appearance. We often have recourſe to the world; only becauſe we eſteem what is faſhionable and ſpecious, in preference to what is really meritorious and praiſe-worthy.</p>
                     <p>THE different maſters, who have hitherto had the care of your education, have only taught you to read and ſpeak with propriety: They have inſtructed you in the elements of ſome of the ſciences; and enabled you to appear with an air of eaſe and elegance. But MY buſineſs is to furniſh your minds with ſuch ſentiments, as may render you worthy of the country in which you live; the reſt is no more than mere varniſh. When your ſouis are filled with the love of GOD, your king and your country, and with a true ſenſe of your ſeveral duties; your character will be complete, your conduct will be exemplary: You will then give every man his due, and live in ſuch a manner as to render virtue reſpectable.</p>
                     <p>THE generoſity which I recommend to you, being that virtue which particularly belongs to people of quality, is not ſimply confined to lending or giving: It extends itſelf much farther, rendering the mind ſenſible of every thing that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting to humanity. What indeed can be more truly great, more worthy of your illuſtrious birth, than to be touched with the ſight of the miſeries of others? You will not only ſympathize with thoſe who ſuffer; but you will make every one about you happy. If you have a detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to command, you will render the ſoldier's duty as eaſy to him as you can: You will liſten to his complaints; you
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:029954_0043_0FE38205A9E7BCC8"/>
will comfort him in his ſorrows, you will be his protector and his friend. Your father has often told me, that the great VENDOME could have led his troops even into the midſt of the ſea; ſo warmly were they attached to their Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral. They were ready to ſacrifice themſelves for the ſake of a commander, who treated them with humanity; and who knew how to be good to his ſoldiers, without being familiar with them.</p>
                     <p>OF that multitude of young perſons who are ruined by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance, none are capable either of friendſhip or compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: Their life, which is a continual ſucceſſion of pleaſures, of debts, and embarraſſments, puts it out of their power to ſerve and oblige others. Their vanity and their paſsions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all they have; and beſides what tends to the gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of theſe, nothing more is to be expected. You will ſee the world filled with this ſort of people; who, being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed in the midſt of large NOMINAL eſtates, enrich only thoſe who plunder them, or who lend them money at an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant intereſt. They inſult the wretched; they deſpiſe the common people; they make a jeſt of the public miſery; and pay attention only to the inſtruments of their pleaſures, and the miniſters of their paſſions.</p>
                     <p>THESE are the men, with whom you muſt never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected: The company of the wicked is truly peſtilential; we inſenſibly grow familiar with their vices, and we ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to imitate them. Engage virtue to find you true friends, and ſhe will procure them for you. There are yet generous minds to be found, whom the world has not corrupted; and who, knowing how to diſtinguiſh betwixt the demands of faſhion, and thoſe of right reaſon, would rather abridge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, than leave the wretched without conſolation and relief.
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:029954_0043_0FE38205A9E7BCC8"/>
We cannot, to be ſure, aſſiſt all who ſuffer; but a well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed mind makes amends for this inability, by thoſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of pity and regret, which render its generoſity, unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable.</p>
                     <p>IT only remains, that I recommend it to you not to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the folly of thoſe miſtaken devotees, who, to make a greater ſhow with their alms, divide into a great number of ſmall portions, what is ſcarce ſufficient to relieve a twentieth part of thoſe among whom it is diſtributed. By confining your benefactions within a narrower compaſs, you will be enabled to do more real good; you may perhaps ſave ſome diſtreſſed families from ruin: Whereas alms ſcattered here and there are like medicines which palliate, but never heal.</p>
                     <p>GIVE the reins to your natural diſpoſition, which has hitherto appeared excellent; and in the caſe of generoſity I know no better guide. Fear not, that you ſhall leſſen your fortune by aſſiſting the neceſſitous; we only ruin ourſelves by being vicious: Virtue keeps every one within proper bounds, who is attentive to her precepts.</p>
                     <p>WHAT <hi>I</hi> have neglected to do in this reſpect, I charge YOU to ſupply; filial affection engages you to do it: And my love demands it of you in the moſt earneſt manner, as the means of enabling me to live, even after my death. You cannot but ſee how nearly it approaches: My eyes are already grown dim; my voice is weakened; and nothing remains to me, but that ſpirit which a ſenſe of duty inſpires. I will keep it alive as much as poſſible, even to my lateſt moment, that I may omit nothing which can poſſibly improve your underſtanding, or exalt your ſentiments. As an equal ſhare of attention is due from me to all my children, I ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to-morrow evening with your ſiſter: She is of an age
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:029954_0044_0FE34C7D8134DE50"/>
to underſtand the language of reaſon; and ſhe is ſo apt to learn, that I have great cauſe to hope my advice will not be thrown away upon her.</p>
                     <p>I AM obliged to ſummon together all the information I have ever received, that I may be the better enabled to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh you all with the means of conducting yourſelves aright. My heart is conſtantly filled with anxiety on your account; it urges, it conjures me to unfold to you all that it can think of, and all that it deſires to ſecure your happineſs.</p>
                     <p>WHAT a comfort will it be to me, if death ſhould leave me time fully to declare my ſentiments to you all! There is a wonderful difference betwixt the inſtructions which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from a maſter, and the advice which is delivered by the mouth of a mother; whoſe words are, every one of them, expreſſive of the tendereſt affection. Could you but know what paſſes in my mind every time I ſpeak to you! It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, as if you actually reſided in my heart; and as though my blood, which can hardly any longer circulate through my veins, ſerved only to be employed for your ſupport.</p>
                     <p>NO: Nothing can equal the tenderneſs of ſentiment, which your preſence excites in my heart: I have told you ſo a hundred times; and I ſhall tell you ſo again and again, even to my laſt breath. The more ardent our affection is, the more it delights to repeat its tenderneſs and tranſports. Alas! every thing conſpires to affect me, whenever I behold you: I ſee your father in every line and feature: When you ſpeak, it is his voice I hear. In ſhort, I ſee my own heart repreſented in yours; and this aſſures me, that when I ſhall ceaſe to live, I ſhall be renewed in you: Ah! Diſmal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſeparation both to you and me.</p>

                     <head>CONFERENCE X. <hi>On</hi> FEMALE CONDUCT.</head>
                     <p>I HAVE long wiſhed, my dear Daughter, for this opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of freely converſing with you on ſubjects of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt conſequence to you. Your youth, the world into which you are going, the ſnares which it lays, and the few days which I have yet to live, all induce me to open my heart to you, and to give you ſome inſtructions relative to your danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſituation.</p>
                     <p>IF you could poſſibly entertain a doubt of my affection, the effort I am now making, when my ſoul is bowed down with ſickneſs and ſorrow, and ſees nothing before it but the horrors of the grave, muſt needs convince you how earneſtly I wiſh to ſecure your happineſs. My wiſhes will never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alined, but while you are careful to lay down proper rules for your conduct, and ſuffer nothing afterwards to tempt you to break through them.</p>
                     <p>IF you are ſo unhappy as to give yourſelf up to the diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, you will no longer be able to maintain the dominion over your own heart: You will live an utter ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to yourſelf; and there will not be a ſingle day, which you will know how to diſpoſe of in a proper manner. The world is never to be ſatisfied; the more we beſtow upon it, the more unreaſonable are its demands.</p>
                     <p>YOUR ſex requires the utmoſt circumſpection; what among MEN is reputed a venial fault, is an abſolute crime
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:029954_0045_0FE38214BACE8120"/>
with us. There are a thouſand things ſaid and done in their company, which a woman ought neither to hear nor ſee. I would wiſh that a young woman ſhould be ſilent and modeſt; and the world, diſſipated as it is, expects the ſame. Its judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of us is very ſevere; and it often fixes our character for life.</p>
                     <p>IF you are over-ſolicitous to pleaſe others, you will run into a ridiculous affectation; You muſt make yourſelf agreeable to every one you converſe with, without letting them ſee that you are thinking about it. Nothing pleaſes which is not natural. A woman, who ſets herſelf to draw the attention and admiration of all upon her, will ſoon become an arrant coquette, if ſhe is not one already.</p>
                     <p>IT is only a natural and virtuous behaviour, which will ſecure to you eſteem and approbation: If this ſhould not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, ſo much the worſe for thoſe you meet with. Whatever happens, this truth is indiſputable; that one of the brighteſt ornaments of the ſex is modeſty. And that a young lady can never appear to greater advantage, than when ſhe is utterly diveſted of affectation in her behaviour.</p>
                     <p>DO not confound the ideas of modeſty and timidity: The one pleaſes, the other diſtreſſes; we cannot avoid being hurt, when we ſee a young perſon confuſed and diſconcerted. There is ſuch a thing as an ingenuous confidence, which ſhould make you not unwilling to ſpeak, when the ſubject requires it; and to ſing or dance, when a proper opportunity preſents itſelf. If you are not vain, you will not be timorous to a fault.</p>
                     <p>I SHALL be very ſorry for you, if ever vanity takes poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of your heart; for then, inſtead of being agreeable and communicative, you will be always unhappy in yourſelf, and
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:029954_0045_0FE38214BACE8120"/>
your boldneſs will only ſerve to make you ridiculous to others. A diſdainful carriage is that of a perſon of mean talents, and a bad heart; people of quality are leſs apt to aſſume it, than thoſe of an inferior rank. We ſeldom endeavour to ſet our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves off by pride, but when we have no other means of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing ourſelves; this is a ridiculous affectation, which the world always laughs at, but never forgives: The more humiliating our behaviour is to others, the more pleaſure do they take in letting us down.</p>
                     <p>AFFABILITY will ſupply the want of thoſe qualities, which you do not poſſeſs: It is the beſt apology that I know for little imperfections. Great allowances are always made for one, who has no pride or pretenſions to ſuperior merit: But ſelf-love naturally raiſes in us an oppoſition to arrogance and preſumption. Many women have become the ſubjects of ſatire, only by their haughty behaviour. Your figure is not without its ſhare of elegance; and the handſomer a lady is, the more ready people are to ſuſpect that ſhe is vain.</p>
                     <p>THE education I have hitherto given you convinces me, that the toilet will not engage your chief attention; you ought to ſpend as much time at it, as is neceſſary for your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent appearance in company. We muſt not fly in the face of faſhion, or make ourſelves remarkable by our ſingularity: But there are certain trifles in dreſs, which we ought to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe. Thoſe which make a woman a ſlave to her dreſs, are fit only for ſuch weak minds, as the preſent age, with all its attachment to trifles, hath not yet learnt to eſteem.</p>
                     <p>LET your hours be properly regulated; and you will find time to worſhip GOD, and to purſue ſome uſeful ſtudy. You will then have no imaginary complaints; and will be an utter ſtranger to the miſeries attendant upon idleneſs: A life well employed, is always an agreeable life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="78" facs="unknown:029954_0046_0FE3821B75E71A50"/>DO not think of amuſing yourſelf with reading romances: It is a real malady to have one's brain filled with ſuch ideas as they furniſh. We never ſee things in their true light; they give us a taſte only for ridiculous extravagances, extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry adventures, and marvellous ſentiments: We inſenſibly adopt the language of ſelf-importance and affectation, and become ourſelves the heroines of romance.</p>
                     <p>THE books you read ſhould be as pure as your heart, and be reduced within a narrow compaſs. It is a miſtake, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that our ſex ought to STUDY. We have no offices of truſt to fill, nor any dignities to be inveſted with; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have only need to learn what is neceſſary to form the mind, and improve the underſtanding. Almoſt every learned woman ſhews that the ſciences do not belong to us: I have ſeldom ſeen one of them, that was not vain, deciſive, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in her manner of thinking, ſpeaking, and acting.</p>
                     <p>YOUR attention ſhould be directed to works of ingenuity; and you ſhould learn the beſt methods of regulating a family, whenever you ſhall be ſettled in the world. You may perhaps be told, that this is not the faſhionable mode of education; but faſhion muſt not be allowed to ſuperſede duty. A woman, whoſe life is a perpetual round of trifles, is only fit to be made the ſubject of a comedy.</p>
                     <p>PRIDE perſuades perſons of a certain rank, that they live only to enjoy themſelves. How ſhould I be grieved, if you entertained ſuch ſentiments as theſe! Pleaſure ought only to be conſidered as a relaxation from fatigue; and muſt always be regulated and approved by virtue. Obſerve this rule, and you will ſee what ſentiments we ought to entertain of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erality of public diverſions. I have ſo good an opinion of your underſtanding, as to think you would one day deſpiſe me, if I recommended them to you, as the means of giving you any
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:029954_0046_0FE3821B75E71A50"/>
ſolid ſatisfaction. If ONE innocent mind has been cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by them, that alone is ſufficicnt to prove them danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; beſides this, libertines ſpeak highly enough of them, to make us ſuſpect that they are rather of a miſchievous, than uſeful tendency.</p>
                     <p>AS to cards, played merely for amuſement, and under the reſtrictions formerly mentioned, I ſee not why you ſhould totally reject them. They ruin no one, they prevent idle converſation, they promote a ſocial intercourſe; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided you uſe them with moderation, this is as allowable as any other relaxation. The ſame may be ſaid of muſic; it is with great propriety conſidered as an accompliſhment in a lady; and is often found of great uſe in thoſe hours, wherein we wiſh for amuſement.</p>
                     <p>REMEMBER, my dear child, that an obliging behaviour is the very life of ſociety. There is no one who is not pleaſed with a ſmiling countenance; a want of good humour would render you inſupportable to yourſelf and every one about you. A reaſonable ſoul ought always to be under the guidance of reaſon; the behaviour of a capricious miſtreſs is a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to her attendants: If you would ſecure their affection, endeavour to deſerve it.</p>
                     <p>MY weakneſs, which daily increaſes, will not allow me to hope that I ſhall live to ſee you ſettled in the world: But it is GOD'S will that it ſhould be ſo; and to his good Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence I ſubmit. Yet let me previouſly obſerve to you, that an amiable and obliging wife may almoſt always inſure to herſelf a kind and indulgent huſband. Let your affection be confined to him, whom you have engaged to love: Seek only to pleaſe him, and peace ſhall dwell in your houſe. If, in ſpite of all your care and prudence, things ſhould not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways go ſmoothly on, you will find a conſcience void of reproach, the greateſt comfort in the world.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="80" facs="unknown:029954_0047_0FE3822021DB01E8"/>KEEP yourſelf an utter ſtranger to intrigues; when we are faithful in the diſcharge of our duty, we have no need to have recourſe to artifice and falſehood. The conduct of a virtuous woman never ſhuns the light: The more her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is inquired into, the better ſhe is ſatisfied. It is a pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iable ſituation to live in a ſtate of perpetual apprehenſion; and to have no better ſecurity againſt public ſhame than the prudence or fidelity of a domeſtic, whom one has made a confidant. Nothing is ſo dearly purchaſed, as the confidence of low and venal minds: Be connected only with women of the ſtricteſt virtue; it is our acquaintance, which fixes our reputation.</p>
                     <p>IF you ſhould have children; do not part with them at that time, when the light of reaſon begins to dawn in their minds. Then it is, that the ſoul is capable of impreſſions, which can never afterwards be effaced; then it is, that it muſt be filled with whatſoever can inſpire it with the love of truth. How very imperfectly do they diſcharge the duty of a mother, who only ſee their children, either to admire, or to chide them! Reflect on the conduct of the fowls of the air; always engaged in the care of their young, they never leave them 'till they have taught them to fly. Are we leſs wiſe than theſe irrational creatures? One would think, by the difference in our conduct, that reaſon was inferior to inſtinct.</p>
                     <p>WHEN you appear thoroughly impreſſed with a love of your duty, you will have fewer admirers of your perſon, than of your virtue. There is nothing more diſguſting than the character of a woman, who liſtens only to fulſome compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; who only lies in wait for flattery, and whoſe beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour on obtaining it is truly ridiculous. A well diſpoſed mind treats every one with proper reſpect; and never loſes its dignity, even when it is moſt familiar.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="81" facs="unknown:029954_0047_0FE3822021DB01E8"/>BE always upon your guard againſt a profeſſed wit: He is a critic, who often does us great miſchief: If he is not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirical, he is at leaſt very forward, and his repartees are to be dreaded. Modeſty is no objection to any perſon: And few have ever yet complained of it. To give your own opinion with diffidence, to hear that of others with attention, and candidly to defend your neighbour's reputation where it may be defended, is a ſure way to be loved and eſteemed.</p>
                     <p>ABHOR luxury and idleneſs; theſe two, which are the ſources of many other vices, weaken and deſtroy the powers of the mind. Study nothing more than a delicacy of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and behaviour; ſpeak without affectation, and write without diſguiſe; nothing is ſo pleaſing as the truth. The letters of Madame DE SEVIGNE, which you cannot read too often, have never been without admirers, from their being ſo exactly conformable to nature; it is a ſure ſign of our want of wit, when we are always endeavouring to ſhew it.</p>
                     <p>SUCH is the advice, my dear daughter, which my own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and my heart ſuggeſt; a knowledge of the world will ſupply the reſt: This is a ſcience, which never is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, and which prevents our being deficient in any neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary point of behaviour.</p>
                     <p>YOU are doubtleſs ſurprized that, in a ſeries of inſtruction, which comprehends the whole life, I ſhould have ſaid nothing on the ſubject of religion. But you will ceaſe to wonder, when I tell you, that I reſerve a ſubject, ſo intereſting to your brothers and yourſelf, for another conference; when I have an opportunity of ſpeaking to you all together.</p>
                     <p>YOUR father, whom you ſcarce remember, charged me to be particularly attentive to your education. Though he is no more, he ought to live continually in your heart, by a
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:029954_0048_0FE38227EEDB8390"/>
conſtant love of virtue; this is the beſt way of recalling him to your mind, and of ſhewing your reſpect for his memory.</p>
                     <p>THE hour is at hand, when you will be an orphan; but you will be in the hands of GOD; he is more eſpecially the protector of the fatherleſs. In other reſpects, you may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the goodneſs of your uncle, whoſe ſentiments I well know. He loves you, and he is a man of the ſtricteſt integrity. He will conſider you as his daughter; and will ſettle you in the world, ſo as to make you happy. With all my heart I wiſh you to be ſo; for it is impoſſible to love you more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly than I do. But enough for the preſent, my dear child; it is time for you to retire; and I am too much agitated by talking thus tenderly with you. Your preſence excites thoſe tears, which my grief will not ſuffer to break forth:—I feel myſelf almoſt ſuffocated;—I would wiſh to recover my ſpirits, but I am not able:—Oh! amiable child!—Oh! mother, deeply afflicted!</p>

                     <p>THOUGH the preſence of your ſiſter cauſed in me ſuch emotions of tenderneſs, as almoſt entirely overcame me, yet I am not willing any longer to defer my admonitions on the love which you ought to have for STUDY. I perceive that I am haſtening to my end; and I deſire nothing more ſincerely than that, being reduced to eternal ſilence, I may find a place in your remembrance. This is the portion of a being, who has only a borrowed and moſt precarious life.</p>
                     <p>I SHALL not enter into a detail, which ſuppoſes a knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of the ſciences, and of the learned pvofeſſors of them. For beſides that it was always my opinion, that a woman ought not to ſtudy mathematicks, or philoſophy; that round of diſſipation in which I have ſpent ſo great a part of my life, has left me little more than common experience, and ſome remembrance of what I have heard others mention on this head.</p>
                     <p>I SHOULD imagine that you can never do better, than devote to literary purſuits the moments which are at your own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal: A mind, which we neglect to cultivate, is like a body which we do not feed. By reading, the faculties are enlarged, the memory is ſtrengthened, and the imagination is enriched: But the principal point is, to diſtinguiſh what is worth reading, in the midſt of ſo many works, as are continually making their appearance in the world; this choice is a matter of real difficulty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="85" facs="unknown:029954_0049_0FE3822CC22BD8E0"/>MR. —, to whoſe merit you are no ſtrangers, and whom I have conſulted upon this ſubject, is of opinion, that you ſhould immediately have recourſe to ſuch writings, as tend to regulate the morals, and to form the mind. He adviſes your beginning with books of ſuch a nature as will furniſh you with ſound principles on the moſt important obligations of life; ſuch as will ſhew you the deluſions of ſenſual conduct, and the deſtruction occaſioned by the indulgence of our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; ſuch as will elevate your minds, by making you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with GOD and with yourſelves.</p>
                     <p>WHEN you have firſt taken care to furniſh yourſelves with virtuous ſentiments; you will diligently conſult ſuch authors, as have written on the ſubject of your profeſſion: It being an unpardonable ignorance not to be well acquainted with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is the buſineſs of our lives. Your uncle, who has been engaged in military ſervice all his life, and who has ſtudied all the arts and exerciſes of war, will be the beſt director in this reſpect; and will furniſh you with the propereſt books on the ſubject: Apply yourſelves diligently to this ſtudy, and you will ſoon reap the fruits of it. A ſoldier, who goes on only in the beaten track, without making himſelf thoroughly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the nature of his buſineſs, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> little better than a piece of clock-work; which muſt be ſet in motion, and never deviates from the path aſſigned it.</p>
                     <p>AFTER this, you will learn to know the world; BRUYERE'S characters, and ROCHEFOUCAULT'S max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims, will be found uſeful to you; in theſe writers you will ſee the portraits of all ſorts of men, both in their public and private capacity.</p>
                     <p>HISTORY is another picture, which you ſhould carefully examine: All the operations of the heart and mind are there
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:029954_0050_0FE38237423746A8"/>
deſcribed in the moſt intereſting manner. BOSSUET'S trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe on this ſubject is conſidered as a maſter-piece.</p>
                     <p>BOOKS of mere amuſement, which do not take their place 'till after thoſe of inſtruction, are however neceſſary, by way of relaxation, to prevent fatigue. I know no romance worth reading, except Don Quixotte, and Telemachus; almoſt all the reſt are either trifling, or miſchievous: Fiction is ſeldom made uſe of with ſafety; it either ſerves to embelliſh vice, or to ridicule virtue.</p>
                     <p>IT is very right, that you ſhould read the beſt poets: Poetry elevates the mind, warms the imagination, and makes us per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the art of expreſſion; but care muſt be taken to ſtudy the poets with diſcretion. Proſe, being leſs likely to ſeduce the mind, is more proper for young perſons who ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves too eaſily to be impoſed upon: We can never be too much on our guard againſt the glaring appearance of what is falſely accounted beautiful. I have known many people, whoſe taſte has been ſpoiled by reading poetry only: The rhyme ſeduces, harmony of numbers bewitches; and what is often only fiction, paſſes for truth.</p>
                     <p>NEVER purchaſe books, without conſulting learned and judicious friends; and remember that it is not the number, but the choice of books which really adorns and improves the mind. The library of a military man is large enough, if it contains two or three hundred volumes; they who have more, either keep them for the uſe of others, or to flatter their own vanity. How many noblemen are there, who make no more uſe of their library, than of their green-houſe, ſeldom, if ever, entering into either!</p>
                     <p>I HAVE heard it affirmed by a celebrated writer, that almoſt all modern works are only copies; and that we ought only to
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:029954_0050_0FE38237423746A8"/>
ſtudy ſuch, as are originals. I am ſorry this author is now no more; becauſe he would have given you the beſt informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on this head; but you will eaſily meet with other learned perſons, who will readily direct your ſtudies. If you purſue the plan here propoſed, you will divide into four claſſes all the books which you have any need of: The firſt, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude books on the ſubject of religion; the ſecond, books of inſtruction in your profeſſion; the third, thoſe which are proper to introduce you to natural and moral philoſophy; and the fourth, books of mere amuſement. We ſeldom read to advantage, but when we read methodically.</p>
                     <p>THERE are other works, which we may run through; ſuch as, the daily, and periodical publications; which may ſerve to give you a ſuperficial knowledge of what is paſſing in the literary world; and will prevent your being a ſtranger to what is talked of in company on theſe ſubjects. But always ſhew wiſdom and diſcretion enough, not to confound this kind of writing with thoſe numerous publications which good ſenſe and religion equally diſclaim.</p>
                     <p>IMPROPER reading is the ruin of young minds; forbidden books ought to be conſidered in the light of evil company. Neither the ſtyle of a work, nor the name of an author, can excuſe your reading either what is ſatirical or impure: Vice is always vice, under whatever colours it preſents itſelf. There are theatrical performances, ſo decent that we may venture to go through them, and ſo intereſting that we cannot help wiſhing to do it. Be prudent without affectation, and you will never have any vain ſcruples.</p>
                     <p>THE books, which you have hitherto read, are little more than the elements, and as it were the alphabets of ſcience; thoſe which you ſhould hereafter read, ought to contain the knowledge of things, and ſound reaſoning upon them. There
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:029954_0051_0FE38316B0475830"/>
are different kinds of ſtudy appropriated to all ages and ſtations. The mind of an eccleſiaſtic demands a very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſort of cultivation from that of a man of the world.</p>
                     <p>THE generality of marked are ſatisfied with being able to write and to ſpeak well; but this is not ſufficient for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in your ſituation. Your country requires that as ſoldiers you ſhould be well inſtructed, ſo as to be able to give a ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory reaſon for whatever you do: You will moreover find in ſtudy the happy ſecret of not being burthenſome to any one; and will have a perpetual ſource of entertainment in yourſelves.</p>
                     <p>WELL choſen books are our beſt friends; we find them always ready when we want them: And, when judiciouſly choſen, they always ſpeak the truth to us. It is a great hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to be able ſometimes to endure ſolitude: We muſt learn how to withd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aw ourſelves from the converſe of men, as well as how to bear with it. We muſt lay in a ſtore of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge againſt approaching old age: By reading, we enlarge the ſphere of our underſtanding; and we afterwards feel much greater pleaſure in the midſt of ſociety. All theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages will attend you, if you love ſtudy, and cultivate your intellectual faculties.</p>
                     <p>YOUR father—alas! I would to GOD, he were now ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my place on this important ſubject! Your father has often told me, that in great towns a love of ſtudy preſerved him from a thouſand dangers, and that in little villages it ſerved him inſtead of company. Be poſſeſſed of this reſource; for knowledge is a treaſure which no thief can ſteal: Yet do not ſeek this treaſure at the expenſe of your health. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate application to ſtudy exhauſts the ſpirits, and fatigues the mind.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="89" facs="unknown:029954_0051_0FE38316B0475830"/>TAKE heed alſo, that learning do not make you poſitive or pedantic; the more men really know, the leſs they affect to ſhew it. We make every man our enemy, whom we humiliate by an affected ſuperiority: But he, who regards his own intereſt, ſeeks to make himſelf friends. If it be true that ignorance is deſpiſed, it is not leſs true that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous knowledge is generally hated: An oſtentatious diſplay of learning never ſucceeds.</p>
                     <p>YOU muſt not expect to find ſtudy always agreeable: Like the roſe, it has its beauties, but is not without its thorns. The beginning of every ſcience, as M. de Fontenelle obſerves, is difficult; and nothing but aſſiduity and labour will enable you to taſte the pleaſures of it. I ſhould recommend it to you to devote three hours, at leaſt, in every day, to ſtudy: Two in the morning, and one in the evening. You are never to forget that you owe ſomething to your rank in life, as well as to ſociety; and that it is with the ſoul, as it is with the body: Exceſſive hunger and repletion are both injurious to it; by the one it is famiſhed, by the other it is overloaded.</p>
                     <p>THERE is another inconvenience in an indiſcreet love of ſtudy; that it makes us too cold, and philoſophical; it makes men behave in company with an air of too much gravity, and abſence; and gives them the appearance of old men at the age of thirty. Accuſtom yourſelves to leave your books, as we leave the company of our friends; ſeem to forget them, 'till you take them up again. The world, perhaps, is very little intereſted in what you read; ſo that probably what nearly affected YOU, might to THEM be perfectly indifferent; every one has his own particular manner of conſidering things. Our converſation with the dead, demands recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and application;, but that which we hold with the living ſhould be full of eaſe, and ſprightlineſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="90" facs="unknown:029954_0052_0FE38243A8A6A1A8"/>IF you are really fond of ſtudy, you will every where find an opportunity of gratifying your taſte: The very graſs on which you tread, and the inſect which you deſpiſe, will ſerve to diſplay the wonders of divine wiſdom. Accuſtom yourſelf always to travel with a common-place-book; a landſcape, a monument, a ruin, every thing of this ſort, finds a place in the journal of a perſon of reflection.</p>
                     <p>THE knowledge of cuſtoms and manners is another ſcience, which deſerves your attention. You will doubtleſs have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, in the courſe of your profeſſion, of ſeeing the different nations which ſurround us: War lays open every country to the obſervation of the ſoldier. You will then be able yourſelves to mark the difference betwixt a Spaniard and a Frenchman, an Italian and an Engliſhman. But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member at the ſame time, that in this variety there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing not unlike the parterres of a garden; in which each flower has its merit and perfection: It is a great error, to expect that all the world ſhould be juſt ſuch as ourſelves.</p>
                     <p>I HAVE nothing more to ſay on this ſubject: My knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of it is very confined, and my ſtrength too much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted to be able to prolong this conference. You live in an age in which you will not want for directors, if you know how to chooſe them: As for me, my chief ſtudy at preſent, is the contemplation of death. I perceive nothing but ſhades of darkneſs, which ſurround me on every ſide. My tender regard for you indeed ſerves from time to time to diſperſe them, and opens to my view a gleam of light, by the help of which I behold you, as the delight of my ſoul, and the very joy of my heart. Nothing moves me, where you are not concerned; but I am immediately rouzed, when your welfare is in queſtion, and I at once forget all my pains and all my infirmities.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="91" facs="unknown:029954_0052_0FE38243A8A6A1A8"/>IF my attachment is too ſtrong, GOD, I hope, will pardon it; for he ſees the very bottom of my heart, that it has at preſent only one deſire, viz. that you may be truly virtuous. I will not ſay, I would ſacrifice my life, to obtain this bleſſing; for alas! what would that be worth, at the hands of one, who has only a few wretched hours, or perhaps minutes, to live? But this is moſt certain, that I never yet deſired any thing more earneſtly, than I now wiſh for your happineſs, both in this world and the next.</p>
                     <p>I HUMBLY hope, that GOD will open the kingdom of heaven to receive me; and I truſt, I ſhall hereafter ſee you with me there. The ſhort enjoyment I have had of you upon earth, is not ſufficient to ſatisfy my affection for you; I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it yet too much alive to die with me.</p>
                     <p>ALAS! how much do we ſuffer, when the heart is ſo full of ſenſibility as mine is! But I muſt even diveſt myſelf of nature, if I would get rid of my ſentiments of love and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs for my children.</p>

                     <p>THE diſorder of this excellent lady increaſing, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired of her being any more able to diſcourſe with her family: But it pleaſed GOD, that the ſymptoms abated, and her ſtrength returned for a little while. Ever filled with the tendereſt concern for her children, ſhe embraced this opppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of calling her ſon, the ABBE, and thus addreſſed him—</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="92" facs="unknown:029954_0053_0FE3824A95D2BB20"/>YOU, my ſon, have made choice of a ſtate of life very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that of your brothers; the advice therefore, which I would wiſh to give you, ought to be perſonally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to yourſelf. My great comfort, with reſpect to the profeſſion you have engaged in, is, that I have not over-ruled your choice; this encourages me to hope, that GOD will bleſs you in it. You have more need, than any other, of the gifts of heaven; becauſe you have more duties to diſcharge: No inſtance of miſconduct in an eccleſiaſtic is trifling or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable.</p>
                     <p>I AM but little acquainted with divinity, or with the books which you ought to ſtudy: But I know that your life ought to be a life of application; and that if idleneſs is a fault in us, in one of your profeſſion, it is a crime.</p>
                     <p>I KNOW alſo that the books, which ſhould engage your principal attention, are not merely books of amuſement; but thoſe which treat of chriſtian perfection, and the means which lead us to it. For how will you be able to direct others, if you have not yourſelf learnt the way?</p>
                     <p>BE careful not to be occupied too much with ſecular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs: Thoſe eccleſiaſtics, who have been ſo engaged, have never yet found it the way to procure eſteem. They are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſought after, and conſulted; but they are not really reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected: We think, with reaſon, that their function ſhould be ſacred.</p>
                     <p>EXTERNALLY to renounce the world, and afterwards eagerly to purſue the concerns of it, is to aſſume a character truly ridiculous: The life of an eccleſiaſtic, immerſed in worldly concerns, is inconſiſtency itſelf.</p>
                     <p>I SAY nothing to you of your morals. The moſt unſullied virtue is ſo eſſential to your profeſſion, that he who is deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:029954_0053_0FE3824A95D2BB20"/>
of it, is an object of deteſtation in the ſight of GOD and man: In ſpite of the corruption of the age, a vicious prieſt is inſupportable. Even the libertine is ſhocked, when he hears of the miſconduct of a perſon, inveſted with your ſacred character: All men expect, that they, who are required to ſet an example to others, ſhould themſelves be really exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary.</p>
                     <p>WHAT can be more offenſive, than the ſight of a clerical PETIT-MAITRE, whoſe whole life is ſpent in ridiculous trifles? There is a certain decorum, which you cannot too ſcrupulouſly obſerve. I never ſaw an eccleſiaſtic, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to be a man of the world, that did not make himſelf contemptible: The company generally amuſe themſelves with ſuch an one, as a bauble or a toy.</p>
                     <p>IF you would wiſh to be reſpected, your outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance muſt not contradict the nature of your profeſſion. Let all your purpoſes be honourable and prudent, and all your words be the interpreters of your mind: It is a certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of a depravity of heart, when we are not circumſpect in our converſation.</p>
                     <p>SHUN hypocriſy, and affected ſingularity; your ſituation is too conſiderable to have a part to act. Appear to be ſuch as you really are, and every one will reſpect you; affected manners ſuppoſe weakneſs or duplicity.</p>
                     <p>AS for public diverſions, conſider them as prohibited to perſons of your profeſſion: An eccleſiaſtic is to be pitied, who cannot find ſufficient employment and ſatisfaction in the duties of his function. I do not mean to exclude innocent domeſtic amuſements among your friends, but an immoderate attendance on places of public reſort. And above all things, what is called PLAY in public, I look upon as criminal in a
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:029954_0054_0FE3825519BFEB40"/>
clergyman: One half of the company ridicules, while the other is offended at ſuch behaviour; and all agree, that it tends to the injury and diſcredit of religion.</p>
                     <p>IN your apparel, be neither careleſs nor finical: A graceful ſimplicity ſhould diſtinguiſh a perſon, whoſe duty it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend moderation to others. He, who endeavours to ſet himſelf off by an undue conformity to the world in his dreſs or manners, appears to be aſhamed of his profeſſion: He is a kind of amphibious creature, who being neither fit for the church, nor for the world, has ſomething monſtrous in his appearance. We are not fond of inconſiſtencies, either in men's outward behaviour, or in their minds: He, who is not conſiſtent in his conduct, is like an actor on the ſtage.</p>
                     <p>THE faſhions of the world are not deſigned to be adopted by prieſts or magiſtrates: The gravity of their character muſt be ſhewn in their manners, and in their dreſs. Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence is deſpicable in any one; in perſons conſecrated to the prieſthood it is odious. What muſt one think of a clergyman running from morning to night, from one ſcene of pleaſure to another? The world laughs at him, religion weeps for him.</p>
                     <p>I NEED not ſay, that you cannot be too circumſpect in every thing which concerns the ordinances of religion; one doctrine of which, you well know, cannot be attacked, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out materially injuring the whole. A prieſt, who ſhould him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf be wretch enough to treat them with contempt, muſt be conſidered as one who holds himſelf up to ridicule and juſt reproach.</p>
                     <p>CONSIDER it as your duty, to frequent the ſociety of the moſt learned and virtuous men: Their converſation reflects light upon us; and we inſenſibly copy after their manners. Be cautious in your behaviour to the female ſex, avoiding all
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:029954_0054_0FE3825519BFEB40"/>
offenſive levity: It fares with the reputation of an eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtic, as with a mirrour; the ſmalleſt blemiſh deſtroys its beauty.</p>
                     <p>LET your library conſiſt of the moſt celebrated books, and delight in reading them: An ignorant clergyman is a man, who makes ſport for the public; one who diſhonours religion, aed whom all men deſpiſe.</p>
                     <p>RATHER be afraid, than ambitious, of heaping up bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and dignities; at leaſt never try to obtain them by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulation or intrigue. He, who purchaſes by mean compliances the higheſt preferments in the church, loſes oftentimes his honour, if not his ſoul. Merit alone ought to recommend an eccleſiaſtic, who knows what his profeſſion demands of him, and is diſpoſed to conform himſelf to the duties of it.</p>
                     <p>BE always ready to open your heart and your purſe to the truly wretched: And eſpecially, if you are largely provided for, conſider your riches as intended principally for their benefit. There is nothing ſo oppoſite to the tenor of the goſpel, as a covetous or ambitious prieſt. Your own patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony will be ſufficient for you, if you are not addicted to luxury and exceſs; it is this, which almoſt always reduces men to poverty.</p>
                     <p>AIM at ſimplicity in your furniture, and in every thing that is external: Let your virtues be your principal orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and be indifferent about the reſt.</p>
                     <p>LET not pride ever take poſſeſſion of your heart; it is the characteriſtic of a weak mind, and the ſureſt way to become hateful to others. There is no one, who is not charmed with condeſcenſion and ſweetneſs of behaviour: But if this were not the caſe, how is it poſſible to reconcile a haughty diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition with the precepts of the goſpel?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="96" facs="unknown:029954_0055_0FE38259C487A718"/>SUCH, my dear ſon, are the inſtructions, which I thought it my duty to give YOU; every one of them is dictated by love, and an earneſt deſire of promoting your happineſs. The ſeminary, in which you have been educated, muſt needs have inſpired you with the love of ſtudy, and a veneration for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Never forget the principles there imbibed; and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en reflect, that a perſon of your character ought only to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the world, for the ſake of improving it. His faults are by no means confined to himſelf; they furniſh all who ſee them with a pretence for ſtrengthening themſelves in their wickedneſs, and perſiſting in it.</p>
                     <p>YOU muſt remember, that the conduct of your brothers ought not to be a matter of indifference to you; your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion engages you to point out to them their duty, and to remonſtrate, if you find them negligent of it. But, to give weight to your admonitions, you muſt ſet them a good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; and you muſt adminiſter reproof with tenderneſs and diſcretion: Reprehenſion is always ill received, if the ſeverity of it is not wiſely tempered with expreſſions of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and humility.</p>
                     <p>YOUR father, who was always intent on the welfare of his children, would have taken every method of enabling you to do the higheſt honour to that profeſſion, which you have choſen.

                     <head>CONFERENCE XIII. <hi>On</hi> PRIDE.</head>
                     <p>PRIDE, my dear children, being frequently connected with an exalted ſituation in life, I think it my duty to ſet before you the folly and danger of it. Be aſſured it is this, which hath carried every ſpecies of luxury to its preſent height; and hath made that the idol of almoſt every rank. We impoveriſh ourſelves, merely for the ſake of outward ſhew; and every poſſible ſhift is made to CUT A FIGURE in the world.</p>
                     <p>WE are anxious to conceal our common original; and that common deſtiny, which puts us all upon a level. We endeavour, if poſſible, to perſuade ourſelves, that a rich man is quite a different creature from the reſt of mankind; and that there is no ſuch thing as real greatneſs in the world, inſeparable from riches and honours.</p>
                     <p>THE effect of ſuch a perſuaſion is, that virtue has no charms to engage our affections; it is a ſhade which we avoid, that we may baſk in the ſunſhine of fortune, whom with idolatrous veneration we adore.</p>
                     <p>WE have ſeen the luxury and pride, which abound at this time in our cities, begin and increaſe in ſuch a manner, as to ruin the moſt opulent families: We have ſeen that ſimplicity exploded, which diſtinguiſhed our anceſtors, and rendered their manners ſo amiable and reſpectable. Their deſcendants very ſoon began to be aſhamed of THEIR plain attire, their
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:029954_0056_0FE3826036030AA8"/>
humble accommodations, their venerable portraits; nothing was any where to be ſeen but a profuſion of expenſe, in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing magnificent houſes, in purchaſing the richeſt dreſſes, and having the moſt coſtly furniture.</p>
                     <p>WHAT extravagance do you not ſee, in this reſpect? I am ſure it often aſtoniſhes you; and you are thoroughly ſenſible of the folly of it; and cannot but perceive, how greatly our morals ſuffer by it, and how bitterly virtue laments the effects of it.</p>
                     <p>WHEN we grow familiar with vanity, and make it the object of our love and purſuit; the ſoul is regarded as a thing of nought, and the body is in a manner idolized: We tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and even ruin ourſelves, only for the ſake of this; and think of nothing but dazzling our eyes with ornaments, grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying our ears with concerts, and our taſte with all kinds of meat, however luxurious and expenſive.</p>
                     <p>IT is pride, which produces effeminacy, and which prevents our ever moving but in equipages, even ſleeping but on beds of down: It is continually inventing new pleaſures; it ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates the mind; and renders even the ſtouteſt men, little ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to women, both in their dreſs, and in their general turn of life.</p>
                     <p>O! MY children, place this picture often before your eyes; and let it prevent your giving yourſelves up to pernicious luxury: My former propenſity to this fooliſh vanity is the cauſe why I am not better able to ſpeak to you on the ſubject; but it has alſo enabled me thoroughly to diſcover its emptineſs and folly. My own reflections convince me, that we forget we are rational or even human creatures; and fancy that our wealth is only given us to procure whatever tends to the gratification of our paſſions. Luxury is an abyſs, which
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:029954_0056_0FE3826036030AA8"/>
ſwallows up the greateſt eſtates, and which we ſeldom are able to fathom: The faſhions which it ſtudies, and the trifles which engage its attention, are ſo many occaſions of our ruin.</p>
                     <p>BE truly great, and you will never be vain; you will know, that there is a certain propriety to be found between the two extremes of avarice and prodigality; and it it this, which ought to regulate your table, your dreſs, and your equipage. You will know, that pride, in making us vain, renders us ridiculous; and that when this prevails, we ſee young men effeminately devoting themſelves to the toilet, and paſſing half their time under the hands of the hair-dreſſer. You will find them as ſeriouſly engaged in determining the colour of their clothes, the ſize and ſhape of the ſhoe-buckle, and other ſuch trifles, as if they were matters of the moſt ſerious importance.</p>
                     <p>IF you give yourſelves up to pride, you will be ſlaves to theſe idle vanities; and you will thereby weaken the force of that manly virtue, which you naturally inherit from your worthy father.</p>
                     <p>BESIDES this, you will have every kind of whim and caprice to gratify; you will find numbers ready to ſupply your demands, by advancing you ſums of money, You will be told, that to be in debt is no reflection upon the character of a man of quality; and you will be encouraged to multiply debts, and to ruin your fortune. Every day furniſhes us with examples, which confirm this truth. How many perſons of immenſe eſtates outlive their income; and find themſelves ſurrounded by domeſtics, whom they cannot pay; by creditors, who are frequently worrying them: Filled with remorſe, which perpetually torments them; and reduced at length to a ſtate of extreme indigence and neceſſity!</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="100" facs="unknown:029954_0057_0FE382655F990510"/>SUCH are the effects of pride: It carries us headlong into every kind of extravagance; and preſents to our view a houſe, the furniture of which is not yet paid for, the domeſtics full of diſcontent, and the maſter of the family himſelf at his wit's end, being no longer able to find creditors to truſt him.</p>
                     <p>THESE, my dear children, theſe are the miſeries which you muſt expect to ſuffer, if you give way to the ſuggeſtions of pride. But even ſuppoſing it did not carry you to this extremity of diſtreſs, I need not ſay more to diſſuade you from it, than that it will tend to rob you of your virtue; make you regardleſs of the miſeries of your neighbour, and fond of all thoſe effeminate indulgencies, and that ridiculous parade, which the world encourages, and ſo paſſionately admires.</p>
                     <p>I SHOULD not do juſtice to your father, if I did not obſerve to you, that he was generous and even magnificent according to his circumſtances; yet a noble ſimplicity, and a prudent oeconomy peculiarly diſtinguiſhed his character. His uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted manners rejected all thoſe expenſive trifles, which an unreaſonable fondneſs for luxury has rendered faſhionable. The love of his country ſo engroſſed his affections, as to leave no room for vanity in his heart.</p>
                     <p>EVERY wiſe and virtuous perſon conſiders luxury as the ſource of all kinds of iniquity: He knows it is in the ſchool of pride that we learn to deſpiſe the poor, to harden our hearts, and to ſeek after every refinement of pleaſure. We cannot bear the ſight of an object that is diſagreeable to behold, we cannot breathe but among perfumes; we cannot exiſt, but in the midſt of ſoftneſs and pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>IT is a great misfortune not to be able to diſtinguiſh betwixt the ſuperfluities and the neceſſaries of life; our paſſions are ſo many tyrants, who allow us no reſt 'till we have found the
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:029954_0057_0FE382655F990510"/>
means of ſatisfying their demands. Hence we ſee, that thoſe among the great, who liſten to the dictates of pride, are really in a ſtate of ſlavery: They are abſolutely dependent on faſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, in the moſt trifling circumſtance of their lives. If any article is defective in the midſt of all their ſplendor, they are diſtracted, they loſe all patience; they appear to be ſo entirely taken up with external ornaments, with finery and parade, that they ſeem to live for no other purpoſe, than to gratify a reſtleſs appetite for trifles.</p>
                     <p>WHEN we viſit perſons of this turn of mind, we do them THE HONOUR to be utterly regardleſs of themſelves, that we may give our whole attention to their furniture. We ſpeak to them only of what is every where around them; we attend only to that which dazzles our eyes: As if we meant to give them to underſtand, that if they had nothing to exhibit, more worthy of our notice than themſelves, they might be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to live in perpetual ſolitude.</p>
                     <p>SURELY, my dear children, there is nothing very captivat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſuch empty characters as theſe; yet ſuch is the glory of thoſe who live in ſubjection to luxury and pride, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

How different is the ſtate of thoſe, who are really virtuous! Whatever miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes befall them, they ſeldom want a panegyriſt or admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but are gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>WHICH of you then, my dear children, would not rather embrace a virtuous poverty, than be ſatiated with luxuries,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:029954_0058_0FE3826D9D44DBE0"/>
and be deſtitute of virtue? I am perſuaded, that neither of you would heſitate a moment, in the determination of your choice.</p>
                     <p>IF my health would ſuffer me to enter more particularly on the ſubject, I could ſhew you other evil effects of pride; and particularly, that it attracts to itſelf perſons of the moſt tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling and inſignificant character. Look at the houſe of ſuch an one as I have been deſcribing; and you will find it filled with thoſe pretty gentlemen, whoſe whole life is ſpent in ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their fortune and their conſtitution. You will find it to be the rendezvous of gameſters; (for gaming is an inſeparable appendage to perſons of that turn of mind, which I have been deſcribing:) In ſhort, luxury has there diſplayed her utmoſt charms, to ruin thoſe very people, who are ſtudious to ſupport her empire in the world.</p>
                     <p>AN elegant ſimplicity will deliver you from the ſociety of men of ſuch licentious conduct, among whom virtue almoſt always ſuffers ſhip-wreck. Where pride prevails, religion is deſpiſed; an immortal ſpirit cannot accommodate herſelf to thoſe periſhable objects, which tend only to chain her down to the earth.</p>
                     <p>DO not imagine, that luxury is inſtantaneous in its growth: It has its beginning, and its progreſs: At firſt, it is no more than a deſire of having our houſes more elegantly furniſhed, or our perſons more faſhionably dreſt, than others of our rank. The love of faſhion inſenſibly gets the aſcendency over us; 'till we think nothing agreeable, in which there is not an air of elegance and novelty. Scarce is this firſt ſtep taken, but ſimplicity becomes inſupportable: We deſpiſe a man, whom we ſee indifferently clothed; and we annex the idea of ſupreme felicity to idle and fantaſtic pleaſures.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="103" facs="unknown:029954_0058_0FE3826D9D44DBE0"/>WE cannot but hold pride in the loweſt contempt; when we reflect, that every one of this diſpoſition enjoys the bleſſings of ſociety, without contributing any thing towards its advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage—he deprives the community of many uſeful members— does not properly diſcharge any duty whatever—and dies, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leaving any memorial, except of the riches which he has wantonly conſumed.</p>
                     <p>LUXURY engages all the world in her ſervice: You would think there would be no artificers or manufacturers without her; and that the arts, the elements, and the ſeaſons, muſt become tributary to her. This it is, which overwhelms the luxurious man with pride; and makes him believe, that he is lord of the creation.</p>
                     <p>I EARNESTLY hope, theſe conſiderations will make a due impreſſion on your minds. Look on her without prejudice, and you will ſee that the pride which is ſo idolized, is more tranſient, than the cloud which paſſeth away; you will ſee, that there is nothing good to be expected from a man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved to vanity, and ſunk into effeminacy.</p>
                     <p>THAT ſwarm of PETITS MAITRES, whom every man of ſenſe deſpiſes, owes its origin only to pride; which fills them with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ove of themſelves: And thenceforth a new race of bein<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> makes its appearance on the ſtage, expoſing their van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity to all around them; and burthening ſociety with all the charges of their exiſtence.</p>
                     <p>BUT there is another dreadful effect of pride; which is, that it gives birth to thoſe idle and miſchievous books, which are continually publiſhing to the world: And which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever harmleſs they may be thought, tend to vitiate the taſte, and corrupt the morals. How many young people have been utterly ruined by improper books! If idleneſs and the love of pleaſure had not taken poſſeſſion of their hearts, they
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:029954_0059_0FE38274ACEB8AD0"/>
would never have quitted that happy ſimplicity of manners, which inſpires us with a love of truth, and teaches us to ſhun evil and purſue good.</p>
                     <p>THERE is yet another thing which I wiſh you to obſerve; namely, that you will inſenſibly loſe your ſtrength of mind, whenever you give yourſelves up to the influence of pride: And what a ridiculous character is a ſoldier, diſſolved in luxury, and totally enervated? There remains nothing more of him than the ſhadow of a body, and an effeminate mind, to which the ſlighteſt hardſhip is a moſt inſupportable evil. Accuſtomed to ſleep under a richly-decorated pavilion, to feed on the moſt delicate food, to be attended by a number of ſervants, he is either diſqualified for the neceſſary duties of a ſoldier; or he carries to the camp a train of luxuries, which are ruinous to himſelf, and render him a bad example to others.</p>
                     <p>SURELY, my dear children, you would not wiſh to be ſoldiers, merely to live in eaſe and ſplendor: Were this the caſe, you would be loaded with reproaches; and your pride, far from procuring you reſpect, would only bring you into contempt. A PETIT MAITRE is entirely out of his place, when he is called into the field of battle: His whims, his particularities, his delicacy, all ſerve to render him unhappy in himſelf, and ridiculous to others. He is pointed at as one, who rather acts a part, than is really ſuch as he ought to be.</p>
                     <p>YOUR good Father has told me a thouſand times, that thoſe fine gentlemen who are taken up in admiring themſelves, running continually from one circle to another, and abſolutely devoted to the buſineſs of the dreſſing-room, were always conſidered as officers of no conſequence or authority, whom the meaneſt ſoldier held in contempt. They can dance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and they can ſing; but they cannot fight; both becauſe the art of war demands ſomething more than mere perſonal
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:029954_0059_0FE38274ACEB8AD0"/>
courage, and becauſe courage itſelf is weakened by the love of pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>LOOK at the portraits of your anceſtors; take notice of their ſuits of armour. Think ye, that the delicacy of the preſent age would have had any charms for them; and that they would have admired an officer ſcented with perfumes! Alas! How ingenious are we, only to make ourſelves deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed!</p>
                     <p>LEAVE pride to thoſe who being ſuddenly grown rich, and ſtruck with ſeeing themſelves become men of conſequence, and encircled with flatterers, place all their merit in gilded furniture, and ſplendid equipages. Neither a virtuous man, nor a man of quality, has any need of luxury to ſee him off. It is a great reflection on the preſent age to ſuppoſe, that it only eſteems men according to outward ſhew: Whereas he alone is worthy of reſpect, whoſe character is diſtinguiſhed by a noble ſimplicity.</p>
                     <p>BESIDES, how many real inconveniencies do we ſuffer from this expenſive turn of mind? Every part of our life <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>avours of an uniform profuſion: We are ſubject to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand forms and ceremonies; we are forced to paſs our whole <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>IT is very ſeldom that a man, given up to pride and luxury, knows what ſobriety is. Phyſicians have obſerved, that all, who live to the full, are ſubject to indigeſtions and apoplexies; and that it is this abundance, which generally ſhortens their lives. We no longer regard our conduct, than while we live in a ſtate of ſobriety: As for pleaſures, they are the chief executioners of the human race.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="106" facs="unknown:029954_0060_0FE3827E032C5120"/>I THANK Heaven, that my health has enabled me to talk with you to day with leſs difficulty than uſual: You muſt have obſerved that my days are not all alike; and that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times my ſpirits are depreſſed by the weakneſs of my body. I have now dwelt largely on my favourite ſubject of prudence, ſobriety and moderation: And if I have appeared tedious in my reflections, impute it to that tenderneſs, which makes me inſenſible of my ſufferings, and which gives me new life, whenever I am endeavouring to inſtruct you.</p>
                     <p>IN vain is death making daily advances on my emaciated body; in vain doth he every day rob me of a conſiderable part of my ſubſtance, I think myſelf in perfect health, while you are with me: My concern is, to know how to endure the inſtant of our ſeparation. I perceive the advances which it makes; yet I find, at preſent, no reſources in my own ſtrength to fortify me againſt that affecting moment.</p>
                     <p>BUT perhaps—alas! I only deceive myſelf; I feel noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but death approaching.</p>
                     <p>THE phyſician coming in, the children withdrew; and gave way to thoſe effuſions of grief, which the preſence of their mother had ſuppreſſed.</p>
                     <p>THE lady, having been at church in the morning, returned about eleven o'clock; and having ſummoned her children, ſhe ſaid, I am juſt come from viſiting my burial place, and from looking with my dying eyes on the ſepulchre of your father. O! what pain has it given me to go through this ſolemn ceremony! But I was willing to humble that pride, which conceals from us what we are; and which would prove your ruin, ſhould you not be careful to guard againſt its illuſions. When we are brought up in the midſt of human grandeur, it is very difficult to perſuade ourſelves, that we are like other men, and that the brightneſs which ſurrounds
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:029954_0060_0FE3827E032C5120"/>
us will ſoon be diſperſed like a vapour. In the mean time what have we, whereof we can juſtly glory? Alas! though you were nobly born, you came into the world weeping, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and naked; and you muſt go out of it not leſs deſtitute of riches and honours. In vain will the world then offer you whatever is magnificent, and flattering to our vanity: All this will paſs away like a dream; and the grave will ſwallow up all your riches, and pride, and greatneſs.</p>
                     <p>IN my viſit to your father's tomb, I ſaw nothing of all that glory which accompanied him on earth, and of all that homage which was paid him. Conſigned to a little ſpot of ground, where ſilence and horror prevail, he has only a marble monument; which already begins to be effaced, and which would ſcarcely be ſeen, if we were not purpoſely directed to it.</p>
                     <p>IS this, then, ſaid I to myſelf, all that remains of the buſy tumult of the world? Is it to this, that nobility of birth, and the moſt brilliant fortune lead us?</p>
                     <p>YES, my children, this is the ſum of all our expectations, as to any thing earthly, whatever riches and dignities you enjoy. Death will place you on a level with the meaneſt of our fellow creatures; it will reduce you to duſt ſimilar to their's, both in weight and value: Keep then your eyes ever fixed on this period of human greatneſs.</p>
                     <p>IT is this which will teach you, that you are nothing but frailty; and that the pride, which is almoſt inſeparable from an exalted ſtation, is the perfection of folly. Notwithſtanding all the privileges of your birth, all your titles, and all your advantages, you cannot command a moment's exiſtence: Amidſt all your grandeur, you are in the power of the loweſt men, of the elements which govern you, of the diſeaſes which threaten you, and of a thouſand accidents, which you cannot foreſee. Your ſoul is as ſubject to ſorrow, and your body
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:029954_0061_0FE38282A8CB4C60"/>
to pain, as that of the meaneſt ſlave; and the poor peaſant, whom perhaps you deſpiſe, enjoys the ſame ſun, the ſame climate with yourſelf, and has the ſame faculties of ſight, taſte, and perception.</p>
                     <p>WHY then, my children, ſhould ſuch a difference be made betwixt perſons alike in ſo many reſpects? Is it becauſe there is ſuch a diſparity in their birth? No: Every one knows, that we all have one common father, that our origin is from the earth; and that many a man owes his eminence of ſtation to inſtances of meanneſs, if not of downright wickedneſs.</p>
                     <p>IS it becauſe they are conſigned to live by the labour of their hands? In this they only fulfil the obligation univerſally laid upon mankind. Is it becauſe they are meanly clothed? Alas! what objects of pity are we, if we value ourſelves upon being covered only with the ſpoils of brutes and inſects!</p>
                     <p>WHAT connexion is there, betwixt that ſilk which is the produce of a worm, or that gold which we dig out of the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of the earth, and an immortal ſpirit? Surely we cannot make that ſplendor, which is only borrowed, the ſubject of pride and vanity. The pooreſt of our fellow creatures hath a body, a ſoul, and a ſpirit, as well as we; from whence we ought to conclude that he is our brother; and that we are much inferior to him, in ſpite of all our grandeur and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, if he has more virtues, or nobler ſentiments, than ourſelves.</p>
                     <p>HENCE learn, that you ought never to deſpiſe any one; and that he, upon whom you look down with diſdain, may perhaps be endued with a more generous mind than all thoſe great men of the world, who, while they value themſelves on account of their ſuperiority, are real objects of pity. How many are there, who, if they had an opportunity of ſhewing their abilities, would, by their genius and attainments, eclipſe
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:029954_0061_0FE38282A8CB4C60"/>
thoſe men of fortune, who look down upon them with diſdain! And whom the patronage of one man of rank, or one fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate circumſtance, might have raiſed to that degree of honour to which their abilities entitled them!</p>
                     <p>IT is therefore neither obſcurity of birth, nor poverty, which lowers us in the eye of reaſon; but it is pride; becauſe there is nothing which is in reality ſo abject, as this vice and its effects. It is always an indication either of a mean ſpirit, or a corrupt heart. How can we deſpiſe others, without caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the ſame time a reflection on ourſelves? But were this not the caſe, what, I pray you, do you think we loſe of our riches or our quality, by receiving with a gracious air all who approach us, and by addreſſing ourſelves with condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to our inferiors?</p>
                     <p>ALAS! the man, who is fooliſhly puffed up with a ſenſe of his own importance, loſes eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>MEN of inferior rank are generally a match for thoſe among their ſuperiors, who treat them with contempt; for they are ſcarce out of their ſight, before they ridicule their whims and pride, and make them the ſubject of their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantry and ſatire.</p>
                     <p>O! MY children, if ever you ſhould deſpiſe the leaſt of your brethren, if ever you ſhould treat them with diſdain; you would diſhonour the memory of your father. He never thought himſelf great, but when it gave him an opportunity of obliging others; and in him the weak and indigent found kindneſs and relief. He removed their ſorrows; he anſwered them with gentleneſs: And if he found himſelf conſtrained to refuſe
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:029954_0062_0FE3828C9025CDE8"/>
them what they aſked, he plainly ſhewed how much concern it gave him.</p>
                     <p>REMEMBER, that your elevated ſtation ſtands in need of the aſſiſtance of men of inferior rank to ſupport it; and that if you had not people in ſubjection to your commands, you would lead a life of the moſt dreary ſolitude, and of extreme indigence. Some labour to ſupply you with food, others offer you their perſonal ſervice; and it is their preſence and aſſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous attendance which form your train, and render you an object of public notice.</p>
                     <p>WE are therefore enemies to our own intereſt, when we deſpiſe thoſe, on whom we are ſo dependent for aſſiſtance. The generality of great men are reſpected only in proportion to their retinue; ſo that they owe almoſt all their conſequence to the very perſons, whom they do not regard. O! how happy is it for us, when we know how to do juſtice to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; when we have judgment enough to eſtimate ourſelves according to our real worth!</p>
                     <p>NOTHING can be more dreadful than this arrogance of mind; which, carrying a man beyond the limits of an earthly being, renders him the ſcourge of every one about him. Might not you, my children, have been born the children of a peaſant, or mechanic? And if this was not your lot, can you aſſume any merit to yourſelves on this account? As to mental endowments, however penetrating, or extenſive you may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them, they are no more than a glimmering light, too often ready to miſlead you: And which oftentimes ſhines only, at the expenſe of ſound wiſdom. Men of the greateſt genius frequently commit the greateſt faults: Where wit is predom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inant, diſcretion is ſeldom found.</p>
                     <p>THE more cloſely a man examines himſelf, the more ready he will be to acknowledge his weakneſs and infirmity. It is
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:029954_0062_0FE3828C9025CDE8"/>
only with reſpect to our immortal part, that we are truly great: But in order to deſerve this character, we muſt be raiſed above our paſſions, and eſpecially above pride. It is a vice which we ought not to know, except that we may avoid it: It mars our beſt actions; and leaves to him, who is poſſeſſed of it, nothing but what is mean and ridiculous.</p>
                     <p>ONLY obſerve the man, who is wrapt up in himſelf, and is full of the admiration of his equipage and his gaudy clothes; and you will perceive a degree of emptineſs in him, which you cannot but pity. The poor vain creature labours for no other purpoſe, than to make himſelf contemptible; while only a ſmile, or an obliging look, would conciliate the affections, and win the hearts of all with whom he converſes. An air of affability, and a word of kindneſs, is ſufficient to gain a thouſand praiſes, and a thouſand thanks. From which you may conclude, that every man of quality, who incurs the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of others, through the neglect of that, which would coſt him ſo little, either a look or a word, or an air, is in effect a dupe to his own pride, and really a very deſpicable being.</p>
                     <p>O! MY children, to whatever rank fortune may hereafter raiſe you, never forget to ſhew a pleaſing condeſcenſion in your whole deportment. Men generally vow vengeance againſt thoſe, who think themſelves raiſed above their follow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, only to aggravate the miſeries of the wretched; to overwhelm them with the weight of their pride; to make them the ſport of their capricious humour; to oblige them to a painful attendance in antechambers, where they are wearied out with impatience and diſguſt. Every ſpecies of greatneſs, which is thus aſſuming, is nothing better than abſolute ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.</p>
                     <p>TO one who contemplates, as I do at preſent, the majeſty of GOD, how fooliſh as well as criminal doth the pride of man
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:029954_0063_0FE3829170AF1AB0"/>
appear! How ſenſibly ſhould I be afflicted, if I foreſaw, that you would hereafter behave yourſelves with inſolence, and become diſtinguiſhed by your haughty and imperious deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! But I am perſuaded, this will not be the caſe: You will rather endeavour to imitate the courteſy and affability of your father. And I truſt you will acquit your mother of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance, if ſhe ſhould venture to urge her own example, as not unworthy of your imitation in this reſpect.</p>
                     <p>HEAVEN, which knows my moſt ſecret thoughts, knows that I deſire neither riches nor honours for you: If ye are only good men, you will be always ſufficiently great.</p>
                     <p>O! MY beloved children, if you could penetrate into my inmoſt thoughts, you could not doubt of my ſincerity; I conſider this union of hearts, as the only means of being always together. Death may indeed deſtroy the body, but it has no power over our affection: This is my comfort, when the idea of our approaching ſeparation depreſſes my ſpirits. It is then, I have recourſe to my intelligent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal principle; in whoſe love and affection, as it were in a ſanctuary, you are to live forever, and make part of my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. It is then, I conſole myſelf with reflecting, that I ſhall not be abſolutely deprived of you; but that in ſpite of all the ravages of death, I ſhall retain you in my mind and affections. The triumph of the cruel tyrant will only be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial: Under this perſuaſion, that our union is indiſſoluble, wonder not that my prayers to GOD are inceſſant, that he would preſerve you, and pou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THE more I think of you, the more I find myſelf intereſted in all you have, and do, and are; and it is this, which height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens my affection to an inexpreſſible degree, that you are my own fleſh and blood. What ſtronger motive can there be, moſt tenderly to love you?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="113" facs="unknown:029954_0063_0FE3829170AF1AB0"/>I MAY truly ſay, I forget almoſt every other thing for your ſakes: Scarcely any thing, except my children's welfare, hath any longer a place in my heart. It is natural therefore for me to avail myſelf of the little time I have to remain upon earth, by ſeeing as much of you as poſſible.</p>
                     <p>EXCUSE me, I pray you, to my friends, when I am departed hence. Tell them, that the duties of a parent ſo far ſurpaſſed every other, that I confined my attention entirely to my fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily; to give eaſe to my mind, and diſcharge my laſt duties. Aſſure them, that they had nevertheleſs a ſhare in my regard; and that the remembrance of their kindneſs dwelt on my mind to my lateſt moment. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hank them for the attention, which they have ever ſhewn me; and which, I am very ſenſible, was more than I deſerved.</p>
                     <p>THE ſad commiſſion, which I am giving you to deliver to my friends, is like converſing with you after my death: Ere long, you will hear your mother ſpoken of, as a ſhadow that is departed; you will then recollect all my tenderneſs, and do juſtice to my love.</p>

                     <p>I EXPECT the return of every evening, with all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience that can be conceived. Neither the temporary relief of medicines, nor the cheering light of the ſun, affords me any conſolation; nothing can do this, but the happy op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity afforded me of ſeeing and converſing with you. You will hardly believe, that I reckoned every hour of the laſt night; only grieving that they did not paſs with greater expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:029954_0064_0FE3829A763DC1E8"/>
in order to haſten this pleaſing interview. Surely my tenderneſs for you exceeds the bounds of reaſon; otherwiſe I could not preſume in my preſent ſituation, to wiſh that the time ſhould paſs with more rapidity than it does, when ſo very little remains for me: But let us improve that little; and let us diſcourſe this evening, on the neceſſity of prudence in the choice of Friends.</p>
                     <p>IF we are right in ſaying that a true friend is a treaſure; we may be equally ſure, that a falſe one is a monſter. He abuſes the confidence we place in him, to our injury; and makes ſport of the affection, which we ſhew him: There are hypocrites in friendſhip, as well as in religion.</p>
                     <p>BUT there is nothing, my children, more agreeable or uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to mankind, than friendſhip: Without this, the happieſt life leaves a vacuum which can never be filled.</p>
                     <p>THERE are a thouſand caſes, in which we have need of counſel or aſſiſtance; a thouſand ſituations, in which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive comfort from the ſight of a friend: He is a ſupport in our adverſity; a MENTOR, to recal our wandering ſteps.</p>
                     <p>GENTLENESS of manners, and a compliance of diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will ſecure to you all the bleſſings of friendſhip: But if you are not upon your guard againſt external appearances, you will run the riſque either of having falſe friends, or of having no friend at all.</p>
                     <p>YOUR choice muſt not be determined either by an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able countenance, or a lively turn of converſation, or a bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liancy of wit; we are often enſnared by theſe exterior ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments. But experience will teach you, that there is nothing ſo deceitful as words, and looks.</p>
                     <p>YOU muſt penetrate into the very ſoul of him, whom you wiſh really to know: If you liſten only to the public voice, you will find your judgment equally divided betwixt ſatire
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:029954_0064_0FE3829A763DC1E8"/>
and panegyric, and you will not know which ſide to take. I never knew a perſon, who had not his ſhare of good and evil report. While ſome commend him, others blame him; and it is almoſt always prejudice, which determines both the one and the other.</p>
                     <p>BUT how, you will aſk, ſhall we get at the heart of him, with whom we ſeek to be united in friendſhip? Your own underſtanding will teach you the way: That will make you attentive to thoſe words and actions, which are purely nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural, and unpreme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>ted; and which unfold the inmoſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of the heart. That will teach you to watch the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing inclination of the perſon, whom you wiſh to take into your boſom; and to attend to his different purſuits, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions: That will ſhew you in the mirror of the mind, I mean the eyes, whether there be ſweetneſs, anger, or pride in him.</p>
                     <p>IT is eaſy to ſtudy others, when we have been accuſtomed to ſtudy ourſelves; but unhappily this ſelf-inquiry is too much neglected. We read, with eagerneſs, books on every ſubject; but we do not give ourſelves the trouble to ſearch into that inſtructive volume, the human heart: Thus it deceives us every moment; and makes us pay dearly for our negligence in this matter.</p>
                     <p>BUT, how great advantages would ariſe from this inquiry! We ſhould know the origin of all the evil that we do; we ſhould learn by what means our prevailing paſſions are moſt eaſily attacked; and we ſhould have none but real friends.</p>
                     <p>LIBERTINES and gameſters have thoſe qualities, which would only ſerve to ruin us. Not to mention, that they are levity and inconſiſtency itſelf; they communicate a love of vice, and take a pleaſure in making proſelytes, like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Every vicious man ſeeks to juſtify his conduct by the
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:029954_0065_0FE3829F1CD8B078"/>
authority of others; and this he hopes to effect, by making converts: As if it were in the power of a multitude to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine virtue to be vice, or vice virtue.</p>
                     <p>IT is not in the circle of irregularity, or in the lap of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that you will meet with minds ſuſceptible of true friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: For ſhe is prudent and diſcreet; and young men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved to their paſſions are intemperate and precipitate. You need not ſee them more than once, to know them tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly; they commend nothing but pleaſure; they admire nothing but diſſipation; they ſpeak of nothing but what is injurious to religion and morality; all which are the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt arguments againſt the admiſſion of ſuch perſons into your friendſhip.</p>
                     <p>IF you ſhould make choice of one that is fond of play; he would ſoon perſuade you, that his paſſion is a certain reſource againſt dulneſs and misfortunes; that the gaming table is the rendezvous of the beſt company; that it is very agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make ſuch great intereſt of one's money; 'till, in ſhort, he prevails, and you are undone. Connect yourſelf with a man of pleaſure, and he will tell you there is no hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs but in ſenſual gratifications; and in the end will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert your underſtanding, and corrupt your affections: One inſenſibly becomes wicked, by converſing with ſuch as are wickedly diſpoſed; this is an opinion, which is confirmed by reaſon and ſad experience.</p>
                     <p>AN ill-diſpoſed friend involves us in every kind of misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; and the wounds which he gives us are ſo much the more dangerous, becauſe he often goes down with us into the pit which he has digged for us. His kindneſs enſnares us; and though we ſee we are the dupes of his folly, we have no longer reſolution to oppoſe it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="117" facs="unknown:029954_0065_0FE3829F1CD8B078"/>I HAVE already exhorted you to leave the choice of your friends to Virtue, which will preſerve you from theſe dangers. She is intelligent, without ſuſpicion, and has the beſt means of diſcovering the truth; ſuch a choice is too important to excuſe our inadvertency and neglect.</p>
                     <p>HOW many are there, whoſe fortune or whoſe virtue would have been ruined, had it not been for the aſſiſtance of a friend! He becomes their guide; he ſhews them a ſafe and eaſy way, and his directions are attended with the moſt happy effects. We eaſily ſuffer ourſelves to be perſuaded, when it is Friendſhip that ſpeaks: She knows the diſpoſitions of the heart, and diſcovers herſelf in ſpite of every cloud and every impediment.</p>
                     <p>HOW happy will you be, if ever you are bleſt with a real friend! He will be a living book, in which you may read your duty; and your own affection being joined with his, there will be only one mind, and one will betwixt you. When we are united by generous ſentiments, we mutually encourage each other to every thing that is good: There is ſomething ſacred in friendſhip, when it is animated by virtue.</p>
                     <p>BUT we muſt not expect to find true friends, if we do not uſe our utmoſt endeavours to deſerve them: There is nothing more common than to hear people complain of the ſcarcity of friends, and nothing more rare than to ſee them ſtudious to cultivate friendſhip. We are not apt to think, that friendſhip is a commerce, which muſt be carried on at a mutual expenſe.</p>
                     <p>DO not accuſtom yourſelves to call any man your friend, whom you have not proved, and whom you do not know to be ſuch: Be honeſt, ſincere, and agreeable yourſelves; and I will be anſwerable for it, that the bleſſings of friendſhip
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:029954_0066_0FE382A6A114D770"/>
ſhall be your's. We form connections too haſtily, to have real friends; and we change them too often, to know their value: There is too much levity to be met with every where, and only the ſhadow of friendſhip to be ſeen.</p>
                     <p>WHAT a diſmal ſtate is it, to wander about the world, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a creature in whom we can ſafely confide! to live always in reſerve with thoſe, whom we converſe with. A true friend delivers us from this reſtraint: He is of more value to us, than all the world, without him. While we ſee, and converſe with him, we think of nothing that is removed at a diſtance from us.</p>
                     <p>I MYSELF experienced the bleſſing of a friend, in one, whom Providence threw in my way, when I was young: Her counſels, and her excellent virtues, firſt began to ſhew me the folly and vanity of a diſſipated life. I truſt her goodneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me has not failed of its reward! Were ſhe now alive, ſhe would ſupply my place to you; my eyes have a thouſand times beſtowed the tribute of a tear upon her; and to my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt breath, I ſhall not ceaſe to regret her loſs.</p>
                     <p>IT was in the friendſhip of this excellent woman, that I learnt to raiſe my mind above the trifles of the world; and that I found by experience that our happineſs chiefly depends on the choice of a friend.</p>
                     <p>INDEED, my children, a virtuous perſon, to whom we can at all times with ſafety unboſom ourſelves, is of more uſe to us, than either books or converſation; when we are agitated by our paſſions, we ſeek an aſylum in his breaſt, and find that tranquillity, which we ſo much want.</p>
                     <p>ONLY make your obſervation on two faithful friends; liſten to them, and you will find in their language and their ſentiments, a degree of candor and benevolence, that will charm you. If they deſcant on the emptineſs of earthly hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:029954_0066_0FE382A6A114D770"/>
it is the voice of reaſon; if they give an account of their affairs, it is done with the utmoſt openneſs and integrity. They adhere cloſely to the dictates of virtue; the ſtrongeſt ſupports the weaker; the wiſer inſtructs the more ignorant; each is content with his own meaſure of knowledge: And in this little ſociety, neither wiſhes to have the pre-eminence.</p>
                     <p>I SHOULD not ſay ſo much on the ſubject of friendſhip, if it were not ſo abſolutely neceſſary in human life. Of what ſervice may you find a friend, amidſt the perils of war! It is very poſſible that he may ſave your life; we ſee inſtances of it every day: Your uncle can inform you, that after a bloody battle, he was found fallen among the dead; and that the Count de * * *, inſtigated by friendſhip, came to ſee if there were any ſigns of life in him, and delivered him from the hands of thoſe who were preparing to bury him.</p>
                     <p>YOU are now arrived at a proper age to think of making ſuch friends: A friendſhip, begun in our youth, is a band not eaſily broken. Experience will teach you, that the generality of perſons, whom you meet with in the world, are only fit for the intercourſe of common civility; and that the number of thoſe, among whom a friend is to be choſen, is very ſmall. Let this choice be directed by reaſon, as well as the affections; and you will never then have cauſe to repent of it.</p>
                     <p>WE are never more ſenſible of the true value of a friend, than when we labour under any ſickneſs or misfortune. The courtier paſſes by, and does not remember that he ever ſaw you; the man of the world ſends to enquire after you, and proceeds no farther: But the real friend riſques every thing; nay, quits every thing, to aſſiſt and comfort you. He divides himſelf, he multiplies himſelf; he knows no greater pleaſure, than in opening his heart, and diſcovering the ſincerity of his affection: We are always ready to diſcloſe our hearts, when we have nothing but virtues to ſhew.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="120" facs="unknown:029954_0067_0FE382ABE90D52B8"/>HEAVEN grant, that theſe reflections may imprint on your minds, thoſe ſentiments which friendſhip inſpires. This is the wiſh of your beſt and deareſt friend, who delights in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you; whoſe heart is tranſported with pleaſure in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with you! I am already abſolutely dead to the world; it is only in you, that I ſeem to live and breathe. O! my too tenderly beloved children! To what an orphan-ſtate are you now about to be reduced! Where are the perſons, whom you will hereafter call by the ſacred name of friends? How happy ſhould I be, to know them! How extremely dear would they be to me! I ſhould conſider them as ſupplying my place in your affections. I ſhould conjure them to be forever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to you; both out of tenderneſs for you, and compaſſion for me.</p>
                     <p>ALAS! my whole ſoul is diſordered by ſuch reflections as theſe: All my thoughts are thrown into confuſion. And nothing remains to me, but the pain of loſing you; a pain, which has yet a mixture of pleaſure, even while it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelms me: And which, indeed, I would not but feel, for all the world.</p>
                     <p>THAT ever I ſhould be deſtined to experience ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety of ſenſations! My heart ſeems to be divided, and my ſoul is in a ſtate of diſtraction; my tenderneſs is agitated at the ſame time by ſentiments of a quite different nature: What a ſtrange ſituation! My love of my children, whilſt it heightens my joy, embitters my ſorrow. If my affection is properly returned by you, I ſhall have abundant reaſon to be ſatisfied: Yet do I ſtill lament your fate.</p>

                     <p>AS it is my deſign to give you ſome inſtructions in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to every circumſtance of your life; I think I ought to ſay ſomething to you on the ſubject of the Court. The ſpot, which you will have occaſion moſt frequently to viſit, is the moſt reſpectable part of the kingdom, as being the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the ſovereign. There it is, that the hearts of all his ſubjects ſhould be fixed; thence it is, that favors and benefits are wont to flow.</p>
                     <p>BUT you muſt know that ſelf-love, and our own intereſt, being the firſt mover almoſt in every action, they who frequent the court are carried thither by motives of ambition, and a thirſt for promotion: This is the center, to which every thing tends. It is here that the vehemence of deſire, and the flame of paſſion are kindled: Here it is, that courtiers pine away with envy and impatience; and there is ſcarcely any one, who does not feel himſelf in an uneaſy ſituation. One is afraid of loſing his place, another is apprehenſive that he ſhall put nothing; and as neither of them will venture to utter his real ſentiments, either that he may not expoſe himſelf, or that he may not reveal his ſecret, they both live in a ſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual diſſimulation.</p>
                     <p>THIS accounts for our finding more ſuſpicion and miſtruſt at court, than any where elſe; and hence it is, that it is the place in the world in which men are leaſt apt to expreſs their
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:029954_0068_0FE382B476258AB0"/>
thoughts and inclinations. When this precaution does not exceed the bounds of prudence, we cannot but commend it; but when it degenerates into duplicity, it is doubtleſs a very great fault.</p>
                     <p>EXPECT then to find, within the precincts of a court, only perſons of very great prudence or diſſimulation; and to ſee only looks, whoſe meaning you cannot underſtand. They often laugh, when they have great cauſe to weep; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times weep, when they have occaſion to rejoice. They publicly praiſe their enemies, if they happen to be favorites at court; and they cenſure even their friends, if they chance to be out of favour. Fortune is the compaſs by which the courſe of their friendſhip is directed; the thermometer, which ſhews the degree of warmth or coolneſs, with which people are to be addreſſed.</p>
                     <p>YOU will ſee, that neither openneſs nor freedom are the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent coin of this place; and that the only way to maintain your ground there is to pay a proper reſpect to all, but to place confidence in none. Never to ſay the leaſt evil of any, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the weakeſt has power to hurt; to confine yourſelves within your proper ſphere; and to have nothing to do with intrigues or cabals. To aſk no favours, or at leaſt to uſe the utmoſt diſcretion in aſking them; to give no occaſion either for panegyric or ſatire. Equally to avoid the haughty appearance of pride, and the mean artifices of flattery; to preſerve at all times an evenneſs of temper, and never to ſhew too much ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility. People are apt to miſtruſt a man of wit and humour; they ſuppoſe that he is always deſigning: And they ſuſpect, that what he ſays is not ſincere.</p>
                     <p>LAY down theſe maxims for the direction of your conduct; and I will venture to aſſure you, that whatever dangers may attend the court, it will have none to enſnare you. It is not
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:029954_0068_0FE382B476258AB0"/>
the path of ambition, which I am pointing out to you, but that of an honeſt man; who ſeeks to get the better of his own faults, and only aſpires after true happineſs. The ambitious man hazards all for all: If his exaltation may render him conſpicuous, his fall may be utterly deſtructive to him. Whereas, with virtue, and a generous moderation, we leave fortune to act as ſhe pleaſes; neither coveting her favours, nor dreading her frowns.</p>
                     <p>IT is doubtleſs a very pleaſing ſituation to be honoured with the confidence of a royal maſter, and to be employed in his name to partake of the concerns of government. But how much trouble and diſappointment muſt you expect, before you arrive at ſuch a poſt of honour! And what perpetual inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude muſt you ſuffer to maintain it! You will not have a moment, that you can call your own; your time muſt be wholly devoted to public affairs. And you muſt be intent on juſtifying the choice which your ſovereign has made of you, by inceſſant induſtry, and by an unwearied anxiety for the general welfare.</p>
                     <p>I HAVE ſeen enough of the court, and of the manner of courtiers, to be able to aſſure you, that no one there is happy, but he who deſires nothing. Is it not a ſufficient honour and privilege to be permitted to approach our prince; to be known by him, and to have it in our power to ſhew by our aſſiduity, how much we love him, and how deſirous we are to ſerve him?</p>
                     <p>WHEN we are only engaged in conſulting the intereſt of our King, we find a court the reſidence of true greatneſs and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; but when we think only of our own intereſt, we find there nothing but intrigues, and jealouſy, and diſſimulation. It is not the ſovereigns, or their family, which render the court a place of danger; but the faulty paſſions which we
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:029954_0069_0FE382B91C0AF098"/>
carry thither, and which an ambitious deſire of advancement puts in a ſtate of fermentation. A prince cannot ſee every thing himſelf; and as the greateſt part of his courtiers are accuſtomed to diſguiſe, his court does not appear to him ſuch as it really is.</p>
                     <p>YOU muſt, above all things, beware of learning there that political refinement, which has not the leaſt connexion with truth; that fondneſs for luxury, which plunges us into idle expenſes; that effeminacy, which enervates both the body and mind; that haughtineſs of ſpirit, which knows no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but that of depreſſing others. A good diſpoſition will imitate nothing but virtues; bad examples ſerve only to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it more circumſpect and attentive to its duty.</p>
                     <p>IF it be true, that a court has its inconveniences, it is no leſs true that it has alſo great advantages: It is the centre of true politeneſs; it is the reſidence of the pureſt language; a certain mode of behaviour there prevails, which is not elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where to be found, and which characteriſes perſons of quality. It is there we become acquainted with the neceſſary forms, and what is uſually called ETIQUETTE: The manner of behaving ourſelves with gracefulneſs, and of expreſſing our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with propriety; of receiving others with dignity, and of writing with elegance and eaſe. You will not have continued there long, without learning the art of being polite without impertinence, reſerved without ſtiffneſs, ſteady without rudeneſs, and grave without affectation. Courtiers ſay many things in few words: They know every thing, yet pretend to know nothing; that is, they are ſo guarded, that yet can neither gueſs what are their real ſentiments, nor quot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> their authority for what they ſay.</p>
                     <p>CHOOSE thoſe characters for your examples, which are moſt generally eſteemed: There are always to be found at
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:029954_0069_0FE382B91C0AF098"/>
court, venerable peers, whoſe company is the ſchool of honour and integrity; reſpectable ladies, whoſe example is a leſſon of virtue. Theſe are the perſons, to whom you will do well moſt intimately to attach yourſelves: You will gain their good will by liſtening to them with attention; by frequenting their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; by a well ſupported conduct, and by modeſty and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. The court is only dangerous to thoſe, who give themſelves up to pleaſure or ambition; we can every where find bad examples, when we give ourſelves the trouble to look after them.</p>
                     <p>IF you ſhould have a place at court, you will do well to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that it is only borrowed; and be always ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign it: This will be the ſureſt means of confirming you in it, and of ſecuring you from any fear of revolutions. Courts are like ground that is undermined: When we think ourſelves moſt ſecure, we are in the moſt imminent danger of falling in.</p>
                     <p>IF you only appear there to pay the reſpect, which is due from you; if you are only anxious to procure eſteem; behave yourſelves with politeneſs to all the world: And above all things avoid the character of news-mongers, or banterers; the leaſt degree of raillery is always ill received. The court is the reſidence of extreme diſcretion; they are always talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, without affirming any thing.</p>
                     <p>THERE is no place in the world in which there is more wit, and in which it is more dangerous to ſhew it. Shew nothing there but plain good ſenſe; that, you will find, is the way to commit no faults, and to have no enemies: We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be too circumſpect, when we live in the midſt of a world, in which every thing is ſeen, and every thing is blazed abroad.</p>
                     <p>NEVER boaſt that you have intereſt, if fortune ſhould give it you: Either you will be beſet by dependents, whoſe appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations you muſt refuſe, and which a good heart ſuffers great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

in refuſing; or you muſt be always aſking favours, and thereby weakening your own intereſt.</p>
                     <p>AVOID the ſociety of intriguing women; they almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ruin thoſe, whom they appear to protect. Their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels ſeduce; they fan the flames of ambition; and all they aim at is to form parties, of which you will at length become the victim.</p>
                     <p>PAY no regard to the friendſhip, which they profeſs for you, or to the queſtions, which they will not fail to aſk you. Their friendſhip may be ſincere, but it may perhaps be inſidious; and in a matter of doubt, prudence preſcribes, that we ſteer clear of danger. There are too many jarring intereſts at court, to think that people there are diſintereſted.</p>
                     <p>WHAT I am now recommending to you is not craftineſs, but prudence; you will not be leſs the friends to truth, for knowing how to hold your peace, and act with reſerve: It is a kind of policy which religion allows, and which it calls by the name of diſcretion.</p>
                     <p>WE find fault with the court, as being the region of toil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome attendance and fatigue; and not without reaſon, when we give ourſelves up to idleneſs and pleaſure. But if you are fond of reading, and make temperance the rule of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; you will find you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Satiety belongs only to thoſe who purſue ſenſual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures alone, and who wiſh to be always enjoying them: Let YOUR happineſs center in your own minds, and it will always then be at your command.</p>
                     <p>BUT enough, my children, on this ſubject; experience will teach you the reſt: She is an admirable inſtructreſs; and it is to her I refer myſelf, every time I converſe with you. But it is impoſſible for you to conceive what agitation my mind ſuſtains, while I am giving you theſe directions for your
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:029954_0070_0FE382C38AF3D540"/>
future conduct. I cannot help wiſhing to look into futurity, that I might know whether the counſel which I give you, is exactly ſuch as will be of uſe to you hereafter; or whether you will be diſpoſed to follow it at all. I am always thinking, and therefore it is no wonder that I am inceſſantly repeating, how dreadful is the ſituation of that mother, who wiſhes to attend her children through their whole life, but is obliged to leave them: Who is earneſtly deſirous to know in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they will hereafter conduct themſelves, what will become of them: And yet cannot, with all her efforts of foreſight and tenderneſs, go one ſtep beyond the preſent hour.</p>
                     <p>IT is a melancholy reflection, that I am at this time anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious to give you advice for the regulation of a life, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps will very ſoon be taken away from you. Who knows, alas! But that the firſt campaign may carry you off, in the midſt of all your hopes; and in the flower of that youth, of which you are at preſent in the full enjoyment. Some unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected accident may perhaps open YOUR tomb, almoſt as ſoon as mine is ſhut. Such are the ſad reflections, which diſtract my mind; ariſing, doubtleſs, in part, from the increaſing weakneſs of my outward frame. They hang over me like a thick cloud, which I am unable to remove.</p>
                     <p>TO my own lot I am no ſtranger; my preſent ſolicitude ariſes from my ignorance what will be yours. O! that death would execute all its power upon me, rather than torment me with theſe melancholy thoughts, which caſt down my ſoul, and fill me with diſquiet.</p>
                     <p>HEAVEN has ordained, my children, that I ſhould be taken away from you at a time, when I am deeply impreſſed with a ſenſe of my duty, and am exceedingly deſirous to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it. Alas! how many mothers are there, who live in perfect indifference about their children! How many mothers,
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:029954_0071_0FE382C87A2B3470"/>
who only regard their pleaſures; while I have this great reaſon for wiſhing to live, that I might be of uſe to you: And that I might be inſtrumental in preſerving you from thoſe dangers, to which your youth is about to be expoſed!</p>
                     <p>GRIEVOUS indeed was the ſtroke, when it was the will of heaven to deprive you of your father; it now ſeemeth good to the ſame unſearchable wiſdom, to double your affliction. Submit therefore in all humility to that diſpenſation, which not the moſt coſtly ſacrifices, nor all that your affection could poſſibly prompt you to beſtow, will be able to avert.</p>
                     <p>BUT, what do I ſay? You may perhaps imagine, that the proſpect of death diſquiets me; whereas death hath utterly loſt its ſting. You will not, I hope, ſuſpect that I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to ſubmit to the will of Providence, all whoſe deſigns I humbly and reverently adore. Pardon, gracious Lord, the expiring efforts of parental affection; which overcomes me, in my preſent ſtate of languor and decay.</p>

                     <p>THE ſubject of this evening's converſation ſhall be that infallible characteriſtic of a generous mind, the love of Truth. You cannot but know, that nothing is more deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than falſehood; and that whoever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>tes from truth is held in utter contempt.</p>
                     <p>BE aſſured, my dear children, you will no longer be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed, than while you ſtrictly adhere to truth. The world,
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:029954_0071_0FE382C87A2B3470"/>
corrupt as it is, never yet ſpoke of a liar with reſpect; it even proteſts againſt thoſe flattering compliments, which lead us to commend thoſe that are unworthy of praiſe: So certain is it, that truth is always acceptable, and that her rights are never to be invaded with impunity.</p>
                     <p>WHAT would you ſay of me, my children, if you found that the affection, which I profeſs to bear towards you, was all diſſembled; and that my words were the language of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture: That the regret which I have expreſſed at being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from you, and ſeeing you no more, was merely the effect of artifice and inſincerity? Doubtleſs you would be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended to ſee me trifle with truth, and proſtitute parental af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. But be aſſured, the contrary is true; each word, that I utter, is the dictate of ſincereſt love: Nor do I think it neceſſary to juſtify myſelf in this reſpect.</p>
                     <p>ALAS! of what uſe would it be to me, to aſſume the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of an anxious or afflicted mother? This would be far enough from giving you pleaſure; nor can I have the leaſt intereſt in impoſing upon you. If I wiſhed to do it, in order to make myſelf of ſome conſequence in the world, death is about to remove me from it; and I have nothing here below to expect, but the ſtroke it is about to give me.</p>
                     <p>CONSIGNED in a very ſhort time to the regions of eternal ſilence, I ſhall neither know what is ſaid, nor what is thought of me. None of the concerns of this life will any longer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect me, except perhaps the love which I bear you; and which will, I hope, be perfected in endleſs joy, on ſeeing you again, received into the region<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of eternal life.</p>
                     <p>THAT truth, which is ſo amiable and conſpicuous upon earth, is no other than an emanation from, and as it were, the image of, the Deity: And the reaſon why we hold it in ſuch high eſtimation is, becauſe we know that it proceeds
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:029954_0072_0FE382D22D563380"/>
from heaven. How great is its beauty, how clear its light, when it penetrates the heart and ſoul! From the moment of its entrance, the mind becomes the ſeat of equity and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor: All writings, which are deſtitute of truth, are calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated only to miſlead; all men, who diſregard it in their manners or diſcourſe, are objects of our pity or contempt.</p>
                     <p>LET truth then be the guide of your conduct, the firſt principle of your actions, as hereby a very material point will be gained: You will not then ſuffer yourſelves to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by evil cuſtoms, or bad companions: Your character will not then be marked by diſſimulation and duplicity; your words, and looks, and actions will be uniformly true.</p>
                     <p>YOU have happily choſen thoſe ſtations in life, in which truth is more particularly indiſpenſible: A ſoldier without the ſtricteſt honour, and an eccleſiaſtic, without the moſt rigid veracity, are men ſo truly infamous, that they are looked upon with indignation. Honeſty knows but one kind of language. When we have recourſe to equivocal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, we no longer deſerve to be eſteemed ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ictly honeſt: we are not indeed obliged always to ſpeak all kinds of truth; but we are never allowed to ſay any thing, which is not true.</p>
                     <p>IT is becauſe men are too apt to loſe ſight of theſe max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims, that the world is full of flattery and inſincerity. You may obſerve, that unfortunately there ſeems to be a kind of emulat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This ſpecies of treachery has always been exceedingly offenſive to me; eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the party ſo treated, being abſent, is unable to defend himſelf: It is cutting a man's throat, without allowing him the poſſibility of crying out for ſuccour.</p>

                        <pb n="131" facs="unknown:029954_0072_0FE382D22D563380"/>YOUR father, whoſe example I always propoſe to you with pleaſure, becauſe I well knew his excellent qualities; your father, I ſay, had an utter abhorrence of liars and evil-ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. He conſidered them as birds of prey, which only ſeek to ſurprize and devour: The liar lays his ſnares, the ſlanderer ſtab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> you with a dagger.</p>
                     <p>O! HOW amiable is truth! Her empire ran parallel with the Golden Age: The tongue was then the faithful interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the heart; then mutual love prevailed, and each party expreſſed it without diſguiſe. The world, as it grows old, grows more corrupt; the very nature of truth is changed; and falſehood too often dwells on the lips even of thoſe who have had every advantage of education.—What in fact are all idle compliments, but the art of ſaying agreeable things which mean nothing, and of lulling people into an utter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility of their faults? I would by no means have you rigidly ſevere; but I would never have you ſacrifice truth to complaiſance. Truth is an inexhauſtible ſpring, from which innumerable ſtreams are derived, whoſe purity may be defiled many different ways. Some depart from it by equivocation; ſome by mental reſervations: Neither of them recollecting, that to be a lover of truth is the greateſt ornament of man.</p>
                     <p>SUCH language, I well know would be incomprehenſible to mere courtiers; but I hope I am not giving inſtructions to perſons, who are ambitious of that ſort of life. The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which I am inculcating, will never introduce you to it; if they do, my inſtructions muſt be ſtrangely miſunderſtood. Nothing would affect me more, than to know that my child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren would be mean flatterers, capable of deceiving their maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and of betraying the intereſts of the public. The very idea fills me with horror. No: Heaven, I truſt, will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ambition to take ſuch poſſeſſion of your hearts, as to lead you to any unwarrantable exceſs. That you may never run
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:029954_0073_0FE382D6D2830B50"/>
into it, ſhall be my conſtant prayer; and your good diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions give me cauſe to hope, that my wiſhes will be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed.</p>
                     <p>IF you improve in knowledge and virtue, as I hope you will; you will be ſenſible of the importance of keeping your word, and never contradicting your real ſentiments: What is it but to act in two oppoſite characters, when we outwardly approve what we inwardly condemn?</p>
                     <p>IF he, who is regardleſs of truth, knew what he loſes by his want of uprightneſs and integrit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, he would account himſelf unworthy of ſociety. It is impoſſible to eſteem ſuch a perſon; no one ventures to entruſt him with the moſt trifling ſecret; and even when he ſpeaks the truth, he is not believed. Other vices may be concealed, but falſehood is almoſt always diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered; and oftentimes the liar is betrayed by himſelf.</p>
                     <p>RECEIVE inſtruction on this point from thoſe old officers, whoſe names are an honour to their profeſſion; and you will know how to regard truth as ſhe deſerves. It is in their ſchool we learn, that our life itſelf is not too dear a price to lay down in her behalf; that eſteem is the companion of integrity; and that every promiſe which we make, without performing it, is an inſtance of falſehood which deſerves to be puniſhed.</p>
                     <p>IN proportion as I enter more deeply into reflections upon death, I diſcover how neceſſary it is to regard truth. No per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in my ſituation can avoid moſt highly reſpecting her, and renouncing every ſpecies of falſehood and diſſimulation. They may indeed be found in books, or in ſociety; but in the eyes of thoſe who ſtand on the brink of the grave, they are lighter than vanity itſelf. Such perſons eſteem nothing more than veracity. Adhere to it, my children, as long as you live, and the bleſſing of heaven will reſt upon you. Hate evil ſpeaking; and be as ſlow to believe, as you are backward to utter any thing to another's diſadvantage.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="133" facs="unknown:029954_0073_0FE382D6D2830B50"/>TRUTH affords the greateſt delight to a perſon of a liberal mind: He finds it in himſelf, and among all his friends; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is connected only with ſuch, as are pure and upright, like himſelf.</p>
                     <p>ALL I have to add, is, that, if a ſingle inſtance of falſehood would eſtabliſh your fortune, you ought to prefer a life of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digence before wealth ſo dearly purchaſed. Honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion unite their influence in recommending this love of truth: It may not perhaps be altogether faſhionable to think, and act thus; but your lives are not to be regulated by the dictates of faſhion.</p>
                     <p>THE exertion of my ſpirits, in converſing with you on theſe intereſting topics, may perhaps haſten my death a few days: But what is ſuch a loſs to a mother, who would freely ſacrifice ages for your good, if ſhe had them in her own diſpoſal? I know I can only remain upon earth, ſo long as I continue to live in your hearts; and that the way to do this, is to ſtore them with my ſentiments.</p>
                     <p>RESTRAIN your tears, I beſeech you; and let me not ſuffer what is worſe than death, by ſeeing you overwhelmed with exceſſive grief: It is enough for me to die myſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeing you in danger of being the victims of immoderate ſorrow on my account. It is true, you will very ſoon be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans; but you will be the objects of the divine protection: His Providence never fails to watch over thoſe, who apply to him for ſuccour, with an honeſt and upright heart.</p>
                     <p>I HAVE lived about nine and thirty years; and there have been thouſands, whoſe lives would have been more uſeful than mine, that were not permitted to live near ſo long.

                     <p>UNDER an hourly apprehenſion of death, I am aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhed to find myſelf again converſing with you. Who can leſs reckon upon the return of to-morrow, than one, who is already reduced to a ſkeleton? It is the will of heaven, that the undue attention, which I have formerly paid to this wretched body of mine, ſhould be recompenced by my being an eye witneſs of its total decay: Wherever I turn my eyes, I ſee nothing but the ſad tokens of my approaching diſſolution.</p>
                     <p>THERE are however ſome inſtructions, which I yet wiſh to give you; and that which I intend for the preſent is not one of the leaſt important. It relates to the harmony which ought to ſubſiſt betwixt you all; and without which, you muſt never expect any peace or comfort in each other. I have therefore called you ALL together, becauſe the preſent ſubject of my inſtructions equally concerns you all: This union only can repair the loſs you will ſuſtain by the death of your parents, and it will deliver you from a thouſand inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and embarraſſments.</p>

they mutually wiſh each other's ruin: Where a cordial affection does not ſubſiſt, there is nothing but confuſion. I have ſeen ſome great families reduced by this to indigence: A wretched ſelf-intereſted ſpirit had ſowed tares in the heart of each individual belonging to them.</p>
                     <p>IT is covetouſneſs, which embroils the neareſt relations; for the ſake of a little pelf, men are contented to break the bonds of conſanguinity and friendſhip: Whereas the treaſures of the whole univerſe are not worthy to be compared with the happineſs of living in peace and unity.

                     <p>WITH what deep concern ſhould I be filled, if I foreſaw that my property could poſſibly be the occaſion of ſtrife be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt you! I ſhould in that caſe wiſh, with all my heart, to have no other inheritance to leave you, but peace and virtue; but I flatter myſelf, MEUM &amp; TUUM, that wretched diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which ſo often ſeparates chief friends, will never be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to interrupt your friendſhip. Nothing upon earth ſhould be permitted to violate the bond of brotherly love.</p>
                     <p>SPRUNG from the ſame parents, brothers naturally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the moſt intimate union from their very birth. This friendſhip often grows up amidſt their exerciſes, and their ſports; and increaſes as their hearts unfold themſelves, and their affections are enlarged. An huſband has not always known his wife; oftentimes indeed he knows little or nothing of her before marriage. But brothers and ſiſters have had the ſame cradle, the ſame examples, the ſame inſtructions, and have lived in the ſame way; ſo that they are doubly to blame, if any matter of intereſt is ſuffered to divide them. The more inducements we have to live in union, the more

clearly do we demonſtrate the evil diſpoſition of our hearts, when we give the leaſt encouragement to diſſenſion.</p>
                     <p>IF ever you ſhould be tempted to diſagree with each other; you will do well to eſtimate, what it would coſt you to ſupport your animoſity, through the forms of a tedious and expenſive law-ſuit: And I will anſwer for it, that you will never be induced to carry matters to this cruel extremity.—Alas! the voice of conſanguinity is not ſuppreſſed with impunity: She always maintains her rights; and a generous mind can never forget them, without doing the utmoſt violence to itſelf.</p>
                     <p>I HAVE ever obſerved, with the utmoſt ſatisfaction and delight, your affectionate diſpoſition towards each other; and I am perſuaded that the harmony, which hath hitherto prevailed betwixt you, has been as much the effect of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genial ſentiments, as of your own good ſenſe. I thank heaven for it; and earneſtly beſeech you to preſerve this concord uninterrupted. Remember, that if it is conducive to your preſent advantage to be united, it will not leſs contribute to your future ſatisfaction; the longer ſuch an union continues, the firmer it will become, and the more ſenſible you will be of the bleſſings which attend it.</p>
                     <p>ALAS! how many unhappy families are there, who, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broken the bonds of friendſhip, are reſtrained, by a falſe ſhame, from mutual conceſſions, for the ſake of reſtoring peace! Self-intereſt muſt have a ſtrange aſcendency over our hearts, before the early impreſſions of love and friendſhip can be thoroughly effaced, ſo as to cool our affections towards thoſe whom we once cordially loved.</p>
                     <p>I DECLARE to you, I feel in my heart ſo many reaſons for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> of a brother, that it does not appear to me poſſible to entertain any ſentiment like averſion towards him: If I am miſtaken, I hope you will always be in the ſame error with myſelf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="137" facs="unknown:029954_0075_0FE382E40BD3B1D8"/>O! IF you once taſte the pleaſure of an intimate union with each other, nothing can be equal to your ſatisfaction: Your harveſts will be crowned with peace; your property will be in a manner common; there will be only one heart, and one ſoul, betwixt you. We deſpiſe brothers who quarrel with one another; and chicanery employs all her arts to ruin them both.</p>
                     <p>VIRTUE is only to be found in the regions of peace and love: Every kingdom, divided againſt itſelf, will be brought to deſolation. Rather give up a portion of your goods, than forfeit the bleſſings of peace: This example was ſet you by your father. He choſe rather to recede from his juſt rights<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than to engage in a law-ſuit with his near relations: Such conduct is highly worthy of your imitation.</p>
                     <p>WE are all ready enough to bewail the diſmal effects of thoſe wars, which, for the ſake of an acceſſion of territories, plunge whole nations into the depths of miſery and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And yet for a few yards of land, we perſecute each other without remorſe: Can there be a greater inconſiſtency than this?</p>
                     <p>THE world abounds with perſons, who, inheriting the eſtates of their friends, neglect to diſcharge the moſt ſacred duties, in order to gratify their boundleſs deſires. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted friend is no ſooner interred, than they ſeize on his effects with the utmoſt eagerneſs, and inſiſt on the privilege of plundering his houſe. Could I think you capable of ſuch rapacity, I would rather wiſh that you ſhould take poſſeſſion of every thing I have, while I live, than diſhonour both your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and me by quarrels after my death. My riches are your's; and I ſhould really be pleaſed to have you make an immediate diviſion of them among yourſelves: I ſhall want very little, for the ſhort time I have to live.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="138" facs="unknown:029954_0076_0FE382ED8305C208"/>THERE is ſomething horrible in the love of money: It breaks the longeſt ties; it is utterly regardleſs of the cries of the wretched; it deſpiſes the cenſures of the world; it leads us into the greateſt crimes. When we thirſt after riches, we deſpiſe virtue as a thing of nought: Even the ſoul itſelf is diſregarded, when this paſſion is predominant; hence ſo many eſtates indirectly obtained! Hence ſo many inſtances of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity to the diſtreſſed.</p>
                     <p>BUT what is a palace, however brilliant, in which there is neither peace nor virtue? It is the ſeat of tumult and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in the eye of reaſon; how much better it is to dwell in an humble cottage, and enjoy the bleſſings of concord and tranquillity!</p>
                     <p>THE riches, which we acquire by diſhoneſt means, are ſeldom of a long duration. Heaven oftentimes, no doubt as a puniſhment for the poſſeſſors, cauſeth them to paſs away like a vapour: Every inheritance becomes in ſome ſort un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, when we only poſſeſs it by diſſolving the ties of family affection.</p>
                     <p>I THANK GOD, that covetouſneſs never took poſſeſſion of my heart; I always conſidered that vice, as the portion of a baſe mind. If your ſentiments are not ſordid, you will think the ſame: The love of your relations will appear in your eyes far preferable to all the treaſures in the world; and you will never think yourſelves truly rich, but when thoſe who are neareſt allied to you are your BEST friends. What a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is it to live in the midſt of thoſe of our own family, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſcord, without miſtruſt; and to be able to find, within the circle of our own relations, all the aſſiſtance we ſtand in need of! This indeed deſerves the name of true happineſs.</p>
                     <p>WHAT can I do more, my dear children, to inſpire you with the love of unity and peace; except it be to deſire you

will approach the couch on which you ſee your mother almoſt expiring? In this very room it was, that I implored the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Heaven towards you, the moment you were born; that your ſouls might be filled with wiſdom and benevolence: And hither muſt you direct your eyes, that you may inceſſantly recal the powerful motives, which ought to unite you to each other. Conſider theſe walls, as ready to witneſs againſt you, if you ſhould ever preſume to violate the bands of fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal affection.</p>
                     <p>AS for you, my beloved Daughter, I recommend you moſt earneſtly to the kind attention of your brothers; who, I truſt, will pity the dangerous ſituation of your tender youth, and always continue inviolably attached to you. And do you, on your part, never forget that your happineſs may greatly depend on cultivating their friendſhip.—Reject, with ſcorn, the advice of ſuch as would—But I muſt ceaſe; a cloud this moment overſpreads me, which darkens both my viſual and intellectual ſight. Adieu!—my anxiety for you will prove more fatal to me than the diſeaſe under which I labour: It urges me to ſpeak, at a time when the extremity of my weakneſs will not ſuffer me to proceed! What a ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle betwixt them both!</p>

                     <p>A DAY in my preſent weak ſtate is too precious to be paſſed over by me, without employing it in diſcourſing with you on the ſubject of religion; in explaining to you
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:029954_0077_0FE382F260561380"/>
what it is, and what are the demands which it makes upon you. I am thankful for that meaſure of divine knowledge which has taught me, that nothing can equal the happineſs of being engaged in the ſervice of GOD. Be aſſured, you will never be happy, but while you live in obedience to His laws.</p>
                     <p>ALL the inſtructions, which I have hitherto given you, would be very defective indeed, if they did not lead you to Chriſtianity. An honeſt and an amiable man are only ſketches of virtue: Religion muſt fill up, and finiſh the picture.</p>
                     <p>I WILL not enter upon a diſcuſſion of the ſeveral kinds of religious worſhip. It is ſufficient to ſay, that we believe Chriſtianity to be eſtabliſhed on the foundation of reaſon, ſcripture, and truth; and that they, who have preſumed to level their attacks againſt it, are ſcattered as the duſt before the wind. This is a fact which hiſtory will ſufficiently atteſt, and of the truth of which you will be thoroughly convinced, if you read it with attention: It is only the ſtrength of our paſſions which blinds our ſight in this matter.</p>
                     <p>I NEVER knew a man of real virtue decry religion; men only attack its precepts and inſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>uctions, becauſe it preſcribes mortification and ſelf-denial. The libertine condemns relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, only to revenge himſelf on it, for the reſtraints which it lays upon him. He is like a man who, having been caſt in a law-ſuit, endeavours to defend himſelf, by accuſing his judges of partiality and iniquity.</p>
                     <p>IF ever you liſten to ſuch people, and adopt their idle ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections to the truth, you are undone: Your hearts will ſoon be corrupted; like the heart of that fool upon ſacred record, who preſumed to ſay in it, "There is no God." We begin with liſtening to blaſphemy, and we finiſh with uttering it ourſelves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="141" facs="unknown:029954_0077_0FE382F260561380"/>WHEN I am tormented with frightful apprehenſions on this ſubject, my comfort is, that you have had the bleſſing of a Chriſtian education: I recall to my remembrance thoſe holy ſacraments, whereby you have been initiated and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened; thoſe reſolutions, by which you have ſo often engaged yourſelves to ſerve your GOD with fidelity. All theſe conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erations fill me with a confident aſſurance, that my children will continue faithful members of the church in which they were born and educated; and never diſhonour the religion of their Saviour, by an immoral or irreligious conduct.</p>
                     <p>INDEED if I had any doubts in this matter, I ſhould weep inceſſantly for you; my ſoul would be caſt down with the moſt horrible inquietude: And I ſhould be ready to curſe the very day, in which I brought you into the world. I ſhould no longer be a mother, moſt tenderly attached to her children: But a wretched woman, that had give them up, to vindicate the honour of GOD. O! how infinitely are both you and myſelf indebted to Him! How wonderfully doth He vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to comfort and ſupport, even me, who am but duſt and aſhes. How, good heavens! can I ſufficiently acknowledge this great mercy!</p>
                     <p>IT is the Chriſtian religion alone, which intimately unites us with the Deity. While we walk under the direction of her light, we are in no danger of loſing our way; we find her preſent in all our neceſſities. She never forſakes us in any of our diſtreſſes; ſhe makes us amends, for all the loſſes we ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; ſhe attends us, even to the grave; in her boſom we live, in her arms we expire.</p>
                     <p>RELIGION ſanctifies our actions; and furniſhes the ſoul with infinite conſolation, by ſetting before it the hope of an Everlaſting Recompence. In what deep diſtreſs ſhould I now be involved, if, being about to loſe you, whom I love more
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:029954_0078_0FE382FB933F5A58"/>
dearly than myſelf, I had no reſource in the treaſures of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven! A fatal deſpair would ſeize upon my ſoul; I ſhould ſink into the horrors of annihilation, and ſhould expire, full of rage and fury.</p>
                     <p>BUT, O my GOD, the confidence which I have, that I ſhall ſee and enjoy Thee, calms my grief; and aſſures me, that in Thee I have what is much more precious to me than the whole univerſe, even more than my children themſelves, though ſo exceedingly dear to me.</p>
                     <p>THUS it is, that our holy religion flies to our ſuccour in the midſt of evils; the more afflictive they are, the more abundant are her conſolations. How happy will you be, if you obſerve her maxims! Nothing can then render you miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable.— You will perceive the hand of GOD in every occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of your life, however trivial in appearance: You will acknowledge his wiſdom in every leaf that ſhooteth, in every inſect that creepeth, in every grain of duſt that you tread under your feet. You will know that, He is the Author of life and death; that He directs our thoughts, liſtens to our ſighs, enables us to behold and to declare the wonders of his providence.</p>
                     <p>HOW many days, alas! have I paſſed without reflecting on theſe truths! The world is a ſtream, which always carries us away, far from GOD, and from ourſelves.</p>
                     <p>IN the eyes of the man of this world, religion is a mere engine of ſtate policy: The profane wit treats it as a fable. But to him who liſtens to its dictates, and learns from it to renounce his paſſions, it is no other than truth itſelf. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it as your duty to become acquainted with religion; ſhe fears nothing, except that men ſhould be ignorant of her excellence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="143" facs="unknown:029954_0078_0FE382FB933F5A58"/>IN vain hath impoſture painted Chriſtianity in the falſeſt colours; it cannot name a ſingle error, which ſhe approves; or point out a ſingle truth, which ſhe condemns; nor can an inſtance be produced of any one who ever repented of being a Chriſtian. Self-reproach is the portion only of thoſe perverſe men, who ſcoff at religion: Scarce doth a fit of ſickneſs ſeize them, but they ſmite upon their breaſts in deſpair, and bewail their impiety. The moment of death, is that of truth. If religion would tolerate vice, they, who are now her bittereſt adverſaries, would repreſent her as lovely and delightful, and earneſtly eſpouſe her cauſe.</p>
                     <p>I NEED not tell you, that it is not neceſſary to practiſe works of piety, in order to procure the character of an HON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>EST man; it is ſufficient for this purpoſe, merely to abſtain from injuring your neighbour: But honeſty is always in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being loſt, when it is not ſupported by religion. When we do not admit into our ſyſtem, a Deity, who takes cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of our actions, and who will either reward or puniſh us; we live like brute creatures; we give the reins to our luſts in every action, which we hope will eſcape the eyes of men.</p>
                     <p>ONLY obſerve thoſe unbelievers, who live without faith and hope; attend a little to their words and actions: Their ſyſtem of morality is abominable; and if their manners are corrupt, this is only a neceſſary conſequence. The fear of man is not a ſufficient bridle to reſtrain us; it may ſometimes hinder evil actions, but it lays no reſtraint on evil deſires.</p>
                     <p>IRRELIGION leads to all kinds of exceſs: In her eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the moſt horrid crimes are ſoftened into gallantry. And the ſoul itſelf, O! dreadful imagination! that ſoul, which was created in the image of GOD <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

which death is about to annihilate! See to what height this new philoſophy raiſes us! You cannot conſider it without horror.</p>
                     <p>IS it poſſible, LORD, that my mind ſhould be filled with ſuch exalted ideas of thy perfections, with ſo ardent a deſire of being forever united to thee; and that after all, my lot ſhould be that of a crawling inſect? Is it poſſible, that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the practice whereof is ſo holy; whoſe outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is ſo amiable; which has filled me with ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; which inſpires me with ſo much reſolution, in the midſt of my ſorrows and afflictions: Is it poſſible, that ſuch a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſhould be a mere illuſion and chimera? Away with ſuch deceitful dreams! My fleſh may decay, and my tomb open itſelf to receive me; but I foreſee a never-ending life awaits me: And the GOD, whom I adore, will crown me with unſpeakable joy, if I am ſo happy as to depart this life in his fear and love.</p>
                     <p>O! MY dear children, this idea already fills my ſoul with tranſport; methinks I already ſee time end, and Eternity— But ſuffer me, a moment, to give up my whole attention to this ſublime ſubject; ſuffer me for a while to forget the world and to think only of Heaven.—</p>
                     <p>HERE ſhe continued loſt for ſome time in the depth of her reflections; but afterwards, recovering herſelf, ſhe reſumed her diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>NATURE has certainly made YOU more dear to me, than any other creature in this world: But religion is an additional tie of affection, by which you are ſtill more ſtrongly united to me. When I reflect on our alliance by conſanguinity, I conſider you as children faſhioned and formed within me, of whom death will very ſoon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>prive me: But, by the light of
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:029954_0079_0FE38300D52F2FF0"/>
faith, I behold you as children ſtamped with the image of GOD himſelf, and deſtined to live with me forever in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of eternal happineſs.</p>
                     <p>WITHOUT ſuch ideas as theſe, ſo capable of raiſing and comforting the ſoul, a mother knows nothing ſuperior to that ſort of fondneſs, which the brute creature ſhews towards its young: Affection, which is merely earthly, is nothing more than pure inſtinct. Whereas religion purifies parental love, and gives it a continuance which will never have an end.</p>
                     <p>LEARN hence, my dear children, that your behaviour, unleſs you have heaven in your view, will be mean and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy. Earth has not a point, on which an immortal being can reſt: Whatever it has to offer, muſt needs periſh with it; and whatſoever periſheth, is as nothing.</p>
                     <p>WHEN a ſoldier is thoroughly perſuaded of this truth, he is a thouſand times a better officer for it. He does not wait to be ſeen by men, in order to acquit himſelf with valour: he knows that he is ſeen of GOD, and that is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for him. A true Chriſtian is never faint-hearted, when he is doing his duty: he is perſuaded that religion has placed him in his poſt, that ſhe requires him to hazard his life for his King and Country, and he is prepared to obey her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
                     <p>ALL my comfort, amidſt the ravages which infidelity is making, is, that you are of ſuch rank, as only to aſſociate with perſons of quality. Liberal minds ſeldom proteſt openly againſt religion; it is chiefly in the company of low perſons, or thoſe who have had no proper education, that impious converſation prevails.</p>
                     <p>GOOD GOD! what pleaſure can a Chriſtian find, in ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culing the ſacred truths of Chriſtianity? What credit can he gain, in reviling the religion of his fathers; in which he lives,
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:029954_0080_0FE383088BBF1868"/>
and in which he expects to die? We admire thoſe letters, in which the Jew, the Turk, the Perſian, ſpeak of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of their reſpective deities, with tranſport and enthuſiaſtic reverence. And do WE ridicule a work, on the authority of which the Chriſtian's faith ſtands ſupported? What an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency! what monſtrous abſurdity!</p>
                     <p>O! MY dear children; if you could look into my ſoul, you would ſee how earneſtly I deſire that you ſhould render un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to GOD the things which are GOD'S; that you ſhould obſerve his law, reſpect his miniſters, and not tamely ſuffer wicked raillery to be levelled againſt any thing which relates to divine worſhip. The leaſt pleaſantry, upon ſo ſacred a ſubject, is almoſt always blaſphemy.</p>
                     <p>WHENEVER YOU approach as near to the end of your life, as I am at this time, you will, I hope, have as lively a ſenſe of that awful Deity, whom we are too apt to forget in the days of health, and in the vigour of life: his juſtice on one ſide, and his mercy on the other, will then engage all your thoughts, and all your admiration.</p>
                     <p>WHENEVER you can truly ſay you fear nothing but GOD, you will conſider the approach of my death, only as an entrance on a ſtate of happineſs. A life full of crimes, and even a life that has been unprofitably ſpent, is a dreadful object to the eyes of a Chriſtian, at the point of death. But obſerve, that the piety, which I am at preſent recommending to you, is only ſuch as is manly, rational and ſolid; founded on the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Goſpel, and recommended and enforced by the Chriſtian church, in every age and nation, in which Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ianity is known. Superſtition never yet made a good Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian. It only expoſes religion to contempt, to make it conſiſt in thoſe frivolous ceremonies, which true piety diſclaims.</p>

                        <pb n="147" facs="unknown:029954_0080_0FE383088BBF1868"/>O! if I had but the knowledge of thoſe great and holy men, whoſe names we juſtly venerate; I would paint true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to my children in colours the moſt lively, and repreſent it in terms the moſt endearing that can be conceived. I would ſhew them, that the beauteous firmament itſelf is but a faint image of the ſpiritual purity of religion; and that the ſoul, which it enlightens, is far ſuperior to the material hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.—O thou Spirit of truth! deſcend into the hearts of my children; convincing them ſo thoroughly of the vanity of the world, that they may be attached to Thee alone! I would rather wiſh they ſhould expire in my preſence, than they ſhould ever renounce their religion. It is their happineſs to be born within its influence: their anceſtors were firm believers of the truths of Chriſtianity; and with my lateſt breath I pray, that, above all other riches, they may poſſeſs the ineſtimable treaſures of ſubſtantial piety.</p>
                     <p>EXCUSE, my dear children, the irregularity of this confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: my language is the effuſion of a heart, which utters its ſentiments in a deſultory manner. The deſire I have, of ſaying a thouſand things at the ſame time, creates a confuſion of ideas; and this deſire terminates only in weak endeavours.</p>
                     <p>INDEED I have the moſt dreadful conflicts within myſelf: my bod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But I comfort myſelf by reflecting, that this ſtate is only a paſſage to a better; and that the hour is at hand, when my gracious GOD will receive me into the arms of his mercy. How dear to me is that religion, which preſents ſuch happineſs to my view! What an enemy to his own peace is the man, who would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card his beſt friend, his ſupreme conſolation in this world!</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="148" facs="unknown:029954_0081_0FE3830E6EDF11B8"/>WHAT I have ſaid to you on this important topic, deſerves to be made the ſubject of your moſt ſerious reflections; as well becauſe it is the language of truth itſelf, as becauſe it is the exhortation of a dying parent. How meanly would you think of me, if I were ſo regardleſs of your FIRST concern, as, in theſe my laſt moments, to exhort you to be careful only to ſecure the bleſſings of the preſent life! The ſight of my pallid countenance, which is the very image of death, would ſhew you, that I ſhould be equally weak and wicked in wiſhing to deceive you; and that the world, with all its charms, is in reality nothing more than a dream which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives us, and which paſſes away with incredible rapidity.</p>
                     <p>A LITTLE reflection will convince you that there is noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but GOD and his religion, the continuance whereof we can enſure; and that every thing has an end, except the dominion of virtue. Good heavens! in what a ſituation ſhould I find myſelf, if I had only reckoned upon this mortal life; if all my happineſs had centered within the circle of a few years! I ſhould ſee nothing before me but annihilation, or ſomething far more terrible. But, by the help of religion, my mind is raiſed up to GOD, and from the manſions of the grave I perceive a light ariſing, diffuſed by the mercy of that GOD, whoſe goodneſs is the ſource of my delight. This is my conſolation, and that of every Chriſtian: this alſo, my dear children, will be your comfort, if you faithfully obſerve the divine commandments.</p>
                     <p>YOU are by no means left at liberty to follow the dictates of your own paſſions, or to walk in the paths of unbelief. The education which you have received, the advice of your father juſt before his death, and my admonitions under the ſame circumſtances, make you accountable for your conduct to your country, and to all mankind. They will liſten to
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:029954_0081_0FE3830E6EDF11B8"/>
you, they will watch you; and if your behaviour is unſuitable to the advantages with which you have been diſtinguiſhed, you will be univerſally deſpiſed.</p>
                     <p>THUS it is that the world itſelf can take its revenge of you; and, indifferent as it may appear about religion, it will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be ready to take her part againſt you. Every one will be ready to cry out, how is it poſſible that perſons, ſo virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly educated, ſhould give themſelves up to ſuch licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſurely their hearts muſt be more than ordinarily corrupt.</p>
                     <p>BUT you will not, I hope, be reſtrained altogether by this conſideration; an earneſt deſire to pleaſe GOD, and not to degenerate from the honour of your anceſtors, will, I truſt, engage you to perſevere in the practice of your duty.</p>
                     <p>YOU have too juſt a ſenſe of this, to forget him who hath made you; or to neglect to offer him, every morning and evening of your lives, the tribute of adoration and love; or to forſake the aſſemblies of thoſe holy perſons, who never fail to implore the aſſiſtance of heaven. It is only by debaſing ourſelves to a level with the brute creation, that we loſe the idea of GOD. How can we forget Him; in whom we live, and by whom we have our being? How can we fail to delight in the ſervice of Him, who is the author and fountain of all our honour and happineſs?

                     <p>I AM not afraid that you will be prejudiced againſt the true religion, by being told, that it abounds with incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible myſteries: common ſenſe will inform any one, that an infinite being is a fathomleſs abyſs; and that his nature is unſearchable.

If you waited only for my death, before you declared in favour of infidelity; alas! how little would you gain by it! Will not your heart be equally open to that GOD who ſeeth you now, when I am removed out of your ſight? It is He, and not ſuch a poor worm of the earth as I am, that you ought to regard; that Being who is merciful to the good, but terrible to the ungodly.</p>
                     <p>O! HOW often hath the idea of his juſtice affrighted me! Even at this time, when I have a deep ſenſe of his mercy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed upon my mind; the thoughts of my diſſolution, and circumſtances which will attend it, make me afraid: the profuſion of tears, which my friends will ſhed, the ſolemn proceſſion, the profound reſpect of my attendants, all ſerve to fill my weakened mind with awful apprehenſions. One while I ſee nothing but the Majeſty of the living GOD, and the inſignificance of the creature, which he is about to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: at another time, with moſt dutiful ſubmiſſion I await the blow which ſhall reduce me to my original duſt, as a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute due to his ſovereign Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>HOW wonderful will be the inſtantaneous change in our ideas! How far beyond the power of reaſon to comprehend! It ſtands aſtoniſhed at the view of that immenſity, into which I am about to enter! Yet a moment—and GOD alone will either fill me with His glory, or overwhelm me with the terrors of His juſtice. What an alteration! All the kings in the univerſe muſt experience the ſame fate.</p>
                     <p>IT is not the terror of the grave, nor the horrible corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which this body of mine is about to experience, nor that

eternal oblivion to which I ſhall be conſigned, which affrights me: but that new world, which I ſee only as through a glaſs darkly, and of which we only know in part, even when we are dying; that ſtrange land, to which all generations are deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined to go, and from which no one is permitted to return.</p>
                     <p>THIS, my dear children, is the object which ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage your principal attention, and not altogether the renown which you may acquire in arms, or the rank to which you may be advanced at court.</p>
                     <p>AS for your mother, while you are all of you deeply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the tumult of worldly affairs, ſhe, perhaps—but why, gracious SAVIOUR! ſhould I diſquiet myſelf with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty?

                     <head>CONFERENCE XIX. <hi>On the</hi> VANITY <hi>of the</hi> WORLD.</head>
                     <p>FOR three weeks our exemplary mother had found her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſomewhat better; at the end of which, her appetite failed her, all at once; this, together with her loſs of ſleep, reduced her to the loweſt ſtate of weakneſs imaginable. Yet ſhe wiſhed to have one other opportunity of converſing with her children; though the inſtructions which ſhe had already given them were ſo full, as to leave hardly any thing, that was neceſſary, unſaid.</p>
                     <p>THE extreme weakneſs of my preſent ſtate, ſays ſhe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords me an occaſion of ſpeaking to you on the vanity of all things in this world. Look at me with attention; ſee how dim my eyes appear; how emaciated my perſon, and what poſſeſſion death has already taken of me! This was the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that appeared not long ago with ſuch eclat; that was celebrated for her amiable qualities, as well as for external accompliſhments. Here are the only remains of what ſhe was; a mere ſhadow—a nothing.</p>
                     <p>THIS ſituation has rendered me much more of a philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, than all the books that were ever written on the ſubject could have done. Alas! whilſt I ſuffer, and even am dying by degrees, I have ſeen all thoſe objects gradually loſe their value, which my imagination raiſed far above their real worth. Pleaſures now appear to me only as mere illuſions, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours as an empty vapour.—Truth ſeems every day to take me by the hand and ſhew me the vanity of this world, and the emptineſs of every thing which it poſſeſſeth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="153" facs="unknown:029954_0083_0FE3831BD17CF590"/>THE ſame effect is produced in me, which the autumn every year exhibits to our view: Juſt as we then ſee the beauties of nature gradually diſappear, I have ſeen the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of this world diminiſhed; its moſt valuable poſſeſſions debaſed, and all its ornaments ſtript off, as leaves from the trees by the winter's blaſt.</p>
                     <p>FALSE appearances dazzle our eyes, while we enjoy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect health; every thing then bewitches us; every thing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces us; every thing appears to us eternal in its duration. Scarcely hath a fit of ſickneſs ſeized us, but truth diſpels the charm, and recals us to ourſelves; leaving us to behold noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a veil of darkneſs, drawn over all that heretofore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited our admiration.</p>
                     <p>IN proportion as I draw nearer to my grave, the horizon grows darker; and thoſe entertainments, which once enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, thoſe balls which charmed me, thoſe aſſemblies which intoxicated my mind and my ſenſes, ſeem only phantoms, of which I have been the dupe, which, on a moment's reflection, diſappear.</p>
                     <p>IT is wonderful to obſerve, what an indifference for life a tedious illneſs gives us: How it detaches us from thoſe falſe pleaſures, which ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>CODED you have thought, my dear children, that I ſhould in the ſpace of a few months, become an object ſo different from myſelf; an emblem of all human miſeries, and even a frightful ſpectre! Perhaps, indeed, you have not courage enough to behold me: At leaſt, look beyond thoſe ſhadows of death, which ſurround me. Dwell not on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

objects, which offend the ſight; but amidſt thoſe ſad ruins, which my body has undergone, ſeparate that heart which is ſtill entire, and loves you with inexpreſſible tenderneſs; that alone has not yet felt the ravages of death. But alas! like the wretched ſkeleton that ſurrounds it, that alſo muſt ſoon return to the duſt, from which it was originally formed.</p>
                     <p>IT will only be my immortal ſpirit, of which we are regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs amidſt the buſtle of the world, that will conſtitute the whole of my exiſtence; 'till the time, when my body ſhall be re-animated. Alas! the only part of me, which hath any ſtability or duration, is that, which I ſo long ſuffered to be utterly forgotten: And all thoſe flattering objects, which heretofore ſoothed my vanity, are now departed as a dream.</p>
                     <p>WHAT folly is it, my children, to be ſo ſtrongly attached to objects of ſuch a tranſitory nature! To put one's confidence in things, which have only the appearance of good! Alas! if all the moſt captivating ſcenes in the world could be now exhibited to my view; had I now the diſpoſal of crowns and treaſures what advantage could I receive from them? Could they one moment arreſt the hand of death? Could they give the ſmalleſt degree of ſtrength to my body, or beauty to my perſon? And, even if they were capable of producing ſuch wonders, would they be of any continuance? Every thing here below, not excepting even life itſelf, is but a dream. How many great men have you ſeen paſs away! Though their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry appeared immortal, we now ſcarcely remember that they ever exiſted. Death hath deſtroyed not only their bodies, but their very name and their remembrance.</p>
                     <p>O! HOW low doth human greatneſs ſink, when the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is drawn up, and we ſee only the Majeſty of GOD! It is nothing more than an imperceptible point, loſt in the abyſs of immenſity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="155" facs="unknown:029954_0084_0FE383250FEFFC90"/>I HAVE lived in the ſociety of perſons, among whom my fortune, rank, and dignity, attracted many admirers; when the vivacity of pleaſure intoxicated my heart, and charmed my ſenſes: But all that glory is departed as a ſhadow, and the ſocieties themſelves are ſunk into nothing. A few years have effected this ſtrange revolution: Time is a pitileſs deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troyer, which is daily conſuming every thing that is mortal, and by degrees annihilates itſelf.</p>
                     <p>O HEAVENS! what a vacancy appears before my eyes, when I review the number of perſons within the circle of my own acquaintance, who are now no more; enough almoſt to form a world! You will very ſoon add to the number: My ſlender voice, my emaciated figure, my exhauſted frame, all unitedly declare, that I have nothing to expect within the compaſs of the univerſe, but five or ſix feet of earth.</p>
                     <p>THE ſame lot awaits you all, at ſome little diſtance of time. Your youth will paſs away like a roſe; and, for ought we know, you are this moment on the brink of deſtruction. The grave receives as many young perſons as old: Every creature is tributary to death; he is an unrelenting creditor, who ſuffers no one to be at reſt.</p>
                     <p>HOW ſtrangely ſhould I have been deceived, if I had rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned upon threeſcore or fourſcore years! By the blaſt of the Almighty the bloom of my life is faded away; and I am brought to contemplate my death, in a ſtate of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme weakneſs; and ought I to complain of this ſtate? I, who, like other human creatures, was born to die, and whoſe diſſipation and folly have deſerved a large portion of the cup of bitterneſs and ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>IT is only by the tenderneſs of my affection that you can know me to be your mother. Sickneſs has ſo entirely effaced
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:029954_0085_0FE38329AF125AA0"/>
every line of my perſon, as to render me quite a ſtranger to my own family, and to all my attendants; they look ſhy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me; they are afraid to come near me; and it is only their exceeding great affection for me, that gets the better of their unwillingneſs to approach me. I am very far from blaming them; for I have much ado even to remember myſelf.</p>
                     <p>IT is only this perſpective, that diſcovers truth to us: while we ſee nothing but the gaudy ſplendor of the world, we live in the midſt of error and deluſion. But as ſoon as we reflect upon our frailty, we turn towards ourſelves, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heaven; we penetrate even into the reality of things, and do not ſuffer ourſelves to be dazzled by appearances.</p>
                     <p>HOW thankful ought I to be, that death approaches me ſo gradually, as inſenſibly to reconcile me to it, and withdraw my attention from every ſeducing object! I paſs my days in reflecting on the ſources of my life, which are exhauſted; in reading thoſe books, which remind me of my latter end: for it is right that you ſhould know, that I never ſpare myſelf on this ſubject. Every morning I take my looking-glaſs, to ſee to what ſtate death reduces us; and often, very often I am reminded, that my coffin is juſt ready to receive me.</p>
                     <p>THERE it is, my children, that very ſoon your fond moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, without either ſenſe or motion, and without any proſpect of returning to this world again, will be deſtined to moulder in the boſom of corruption. O! fearful thought!—But I will ſpare your tenderneſs on a ſubject too affecting for you, as well as for myſelf. You are not ignorant, (indeed who is?) that this diſmal end is the lot of all men; and that in ſpite of the pleaſures, which delude them, in ſpite of the falſe glory which dazzles them, they muſt fall into the depths of horror and oblivion.</p>

                        <pb n="157" facs="unknown:029954_0085_0FE38329AF125AA0"/>DREADFUL as the darkneſs of the tomb may appear, it has enlightened me more than the brightneſs of the ſun: This only ſhews me periſhable objects, that diſcovers to me the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of my ſpiritual part, and the Majeſty of my GOD, which before were in a manner concealed from me. By the help of the light which that imparts to me, I have gone thro' the whole world, and have diſcovered much vanity and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery; I have ſeen nothing more effectually inſtructive than death and dying perſons, burials and epitaphs.</p>
                     <p>SEE all that remains to me of earthly greatneſs: A ſhort inſcription ſerves to inform others, that we once lived, and are now no more; and even this is effaced by length of time. The marble itſelf decays; and the eternity of the ſupreme Being triumphs over the nothingneſs of man.</p>
                     <p>I HAVE ſaid enough, I hope, my dear children, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you, that I do not wiſh for inſcriptions, or magnificent titles on my tomb: I am nothing more than duſt, and to the ſame element am I returning, from which I was formed. And can dry bones reduced to duſt, and mouldering in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, deſerve a panegyric?

Heaven would arm itſelf againſt me, if I thought of decorating a miſerable ſepulchre; it would only ſerve to perpetuate my pride beyond the limits of this preſent life, if I ſhould attempt by improper ornaments to alter the very nature of that, which in itſelf is nothing but miſery and corruption.</p>

That awful ſolemnity, that mournful ſilence, which prevail in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of ſepulchres, will give you leiſure and inclination to meditate ſeriouſly on all that I have ſaid to you. The repreſentation of death is the beſt ſchool, wherein we can learn to live as we ought; to raiſe the ſoul from earthly things and to fix it upon GOD.</p>
                     <p>PROMISE me, that you will ſometimes viſit that inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſpot; I invite you thither: And if you love me well enough to have your minds properly ſtored with the precepts which I have delivered to you, you will conſider me as actually preſent with you there; I ſhall have no other method of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to you, or converſing with you.</p>
                     <p>ALAS! my poor children, what a melancholy taſk am I impoſing on you! if the world knew it, it would be ſilly enough to treat it with contempt: But my affection prompts me to communicate to you this uſeful and important ſecret.

It is fond of nothing which does not contribute to its amuſement; and eſteems nothing but what flatters its taſte for vanity and pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>WHAT an impaſſable gulph is about to interpoſe itſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the world and me! Yet a little while and I ſhall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know what ſcenes of entertainment are exhibited; nor what revolutions take place in it: Yet a very little while, and all ideas of the ſucceſſion of months and years will be utterly loſt. But that which gives me ſome concern is, that this ſpot of earth on which you remain, will be loſt in that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:029954_0086_0FE383312D489EF0"/>
which awaits me; ſo that I ſhall be totally unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with your conduct or your deſtination. What a change muſt be wrought in my exiſtence! What a revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in my ſentiments! Is it poſſible to conceive, that an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſhould produce ſuch aſtoniſhing effects? At preſent I cannot properly be ſaid to belong either to this world or the other: I am like a traveller divided between two different ways; and death, in the twinkling of an eye, will put an end to my uncertainty. One while I feel myſelf reluctant; at another time I deſire the ſtroke: Strange alternative! on one ſide, is the proſpect of ſupreme felicity; on the other, the pain of being ſeparated from that which is moſt dear to me.</p>
                     <p>I DOUBT not, my children, but my love for you will be conſidered as romantic; and indeed, I believe it riſes to an uncommon height. But this at leaſt I am ſure of, that I am not miſtaken in the advice which I have given you: It is the language of truth; it is the voice of a dying friend that you have heard.</p>

Here, my children, is a ſcene yet more affecting; we have no reſource to fiction here: The chief character in this tragedy is a mother really expiring; the ſentence is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, and is on the very point of being executed.</p>
                     <p>I HAVE for ſome days felt myſelf more weak than uſual, and find that life is now making its eſcape from this totter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frame; nothing indeed ſupports me but my tenderneſs for you: Hitherto it has detained my fugitive ſpirit, but at length it will be forced to yield.</p>

                        <pb n="160" facs="unknown:029954_0087_0FE38336C224F728"/>COME hither, that I may embrace you; if you have the courage to join your lips to an expiring body, and to bathe in a flood of tears. Alas! I have nothing but tears to give you; the weakneſs of my body and the ſtrength which yet remains, deſtroy my powers of utterance.</p>
                     <p>HOW ſad the ſeparation! What a mournful farewel! The tenderneſs of my affection reminds me of the hour in which I brought you into the world; but there is this ſad difference, that I this day behold you to ſee you no more. Support me, gracious Father, in this dreadful trial: Suffer me not to ſink under the burthen of maternal tenderneſs. I know that I ought to forget every thing for thy ſake; and yet my heart never ceaſes to think of my children. Dear as they are to me, efface them for ever from my memory, if this love either it or will be imputed to me as a fault.</p>
                     <p>BUT, what am I ſaying? Good GOD! thou knoweſt that I only love them for thy ſake, and that I wiſh them no other happineſs than that which ariſes from obedience to thy law. My only reaſon for wiſhing to live among them a few years, had it been thy gracious will, is to eſtabliſh in them the love of that which is good: This it is, which makes my ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from my children a thouſand times more painful than the approaching ſeparation of my ſoul from my body. See! there they are! Yet do I ſee and hear them! Yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>OUR excellent mother, having received a viſit from her brother in law, and having converſed with him for half an hour, deſired he would permit her to introduce her children to him: When in the language of the tendereſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, ſhe thus addreſſed them.</p>
                     <p>THIS, my dear Children, is the perſon whom henceforth you are to conſider as your parent: As you are connected with him by the ties of conſanguinity, I beſeech you to attach yourſelves to him by the obligations of inviolable friendſhip. The love you have for me, which is about to expire, when I ſhall no longer exiſt in this world, ought to be transferred to your uncle: To his favour I recommend you; no one can give you better advice than he can.</p>
                     <p>THEN turning herſelf towards her brother, ſhe addreſſed him thus: O my dear brother, you who continually remind me of my excellent huſband, and in whom I have always found ſuch ſentiments as one ſo nearly related to him may eaſily be ſuppoſed to entertain, have pity on theſe children. Pity their tender age; pity their orphan ſtate, when I ſhall be taken from them. My days are ended; my life is but a blaſt, and nothing remains to me but the regret of having wretchedly miſpent it.</p>
                     <p>O! THAT I could now be aſſured by you that my wiſhes would be accompliſhed: What would become of theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:029954_0088_0FE3833E84AC7110"/>
creatures in the midſt of a moſt dangerous world, if they were not bleſt with your friendſhip! In them, my dear brother, recollect both their father, whom you affectionately loved, and their mother, who has no power of utterance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond ſighs and tears.</p>
                     <p>MY heart is inexpreſſibly affected at this dreadful ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even as it were, from myſelf: As I before obſerved to you, it is more terrible to me than the horrors of the grave.</p>
                     <p>FORGIVE me, gracious LORD! Thou knoweſt, that even in my dreams, even in the moſt ſolemn acts of devotion, even in the prayers addreſſed to thy heavenly Majeſty, the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of my family continually interpoſed itſelf, to diſtract my mind: In vain have I wiſhed to have my whole atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion fixed upon Thee: In vain have I endeavoured to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come wholly abſorbed by the contemplation of Thine infinite perfections. My thoughts perpetually recur to thoſe objects of my love; which Thou haſt given me, and art now about to ſeparate from me.</p>
                     <p>ALAS! my dear children, I feel that I have much leſs fortitude than I appear to have: One moment's reflection on your ſad condition, one ſingle thought on the ſubject of our ſeparation, overwhelms my ſoul with the deepeſt ſorrow. O! Heaven! my mind hath but too much ſenſibility at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: Ere long, no viſible object will affect it. Theſe, my dear children, are the laſt ſtruggles of my affection: My heart at this moment ſeems to collect every thing that is moſt tender and affectionate, in order to bid you an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing farewel.</p>
                     <p>AT theſe words ſhe melted into tears, when her brother-in-law anſwered;</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="163" facs="unknown:029954_0088_0FE3833E84AC7110"/>"NO, my ſiſter, GOD will not be offended with that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs for which you blame yourſelf: He is goodneſs itſelf; and the holy ſcriptures dwell particularly on the ſubject of his love. If your affection for your children were merely carnal and earthly, the caſe were different; but your love for them is that of a Chriſtian parent, who is chiefly ſolicitous for their eternal ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>"MAKE yourſelf as eaſy as poſſible on their account; you entruſt them to my care, and I will not be regardleſs of their welfare. I ſhall conſider them as my own children; in me they ſhall at once experience the authority of a father, and the affection of a mother; and I verily believe we ſhall none of us forget the confidence you repoſe in us. Comfort yourſelf, therefore, with reflecting, that you leave us only preparing ourſelves to follow you; ſince this life, however long it may be accounted, is in reality no more than a ſtate of momentary exiſtence."</p>

                     <head>CONFERENCE XXI. <hi>On</hi> KINDNESS <hi>to</hi> DOMESTICS.</head>
                     <p>THOUGH our exemplary mother appeared to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted her whole power of utterance in theſe admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to her children yet one ſubject remained, ariſing from the care ſhe took to recommend to their kindneſs her family and dependents.</p>
                     <p>WHEN they were all together, ſhe ſaid to her ſons, in a voice that could with difficulty be heard: I charge you to
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:029954_0089_0FE383434F3C7788"/>
be kind to theſe my domeſtics, who have always been ſtrongly attached to me.—Some of them ſerved your father, and others have given me every proof of the moſt dutiful regard. I have not forgotten them in my will; but that is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. They have a demand on you for kindneſſes, as friends in diſtreſs; for it is in this point of view, that I would have you conſider them: They are ſprung from the ſame origin and are deſtined to the ſame end with ourſelves.</p>
                     <p>O! HOW unreaſonable is that pride, which the world af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; and which makes us look down with contempt on perſons, in every eſſential reſpect, like ourſelves!</p>
                     <p>NEVER forget, that we diſhonour and debaſe human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture whenever we treat any perſon with diſdain, merely becauſe his external appearance is meaner than our own. Your names, when you were baptized, were entered in the ſame regiſter with thoſe of the pooreſt; and the duſt, to which you will one day be reduced, may aſſure you that the ſame deſtiny of mortality awaits us all.</p>
                     <p>AM I not going to be mixed with the loweſt and meaneſt of my fellow-creatures? Shall I not be reduced to a level with the humbleſt ſlave? Thus doth death caſt down the high looks of the proud.</p>
                     <p>YOU will indeed act agreeably to my wiſhes, when you treat your domeſtics with kindneſs; when you watch over their morals and take care of their health. GOD knows that even at the time, when pride and a love of the world fed my vanity, I was never altogether unmindful of them; nor ever ſpoke to them in a haughty ſtyle: If I ever did, here they are, let them witneſs againſt me."</p>
                     <p>TO theſe words her domeſtics could only reply with ſighs and lamentations; and her children, overwhelmed with grief, with interrupted accents, ſaid:</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="165" facs="unknown:029954_0089_0FE383434F3C7788"/>"O! THAT your days could be prolonged, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ardency of our deſires! You ſhould acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, in our ſentiments, a perfect copy of your own. You ſhould then ſee and know, that nothing can ever remove from our hearts the love with which they are filled towards you, or the maxims with which you have ſo richly ſtored our minds.</p>

                     <p>LET us, my dear children, for the laſt time, mix our tears together. The moment approaches, when, inſenſible to your cries, I ſhall no longer behold this earth, or he intereſted in what is paſſing on it: I ſhall not even have the conſolation of feeling that tender anxiety, that pleaſing pain, which I now ſuffer on your account.</p>
                     <p>YOUR uncle will communicate to you the contents of my will. I have too good an opinion of you, to think you will diſapprove of the legacies which I have bequeathed to the poor, and to ſome perſons with whoſe merit I am well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted.</p>
                     <p>A FEW days after this laſt interview, her diſorder made ſuch a progreſs, that, being at the very point of death, ſhe received a viſit from her children, who, with the tendereſt effuſions of grief, requeſted her laſt bleſſing.</p>
                     <p>THEN, juſt opening her dying lips, ſhe with the utmoſt difficulty ſaid:</p>
                     <p>"THE hand of death is upon me; your mother is no more.—May the Lord receive you under his protection! With my laſt breath I earneſtly beſeech him to PARDON ME, and BLESS YOU.—You now ſee little more of me,
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:029954_0090_0FE3834C086A6370"/>
than a particle of earth, about to be re-committed to the earth! Such is the end of human greatneſs: Adieu! my dear, my affectionate children, adieu for ever.</p>
                     <p>MY grave is opening—eternity commences—Gracious LORD, receive my ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>HER eyes ſtill looked for her children, 'till ſhe expired.— Thus died this incomparable mother, the remembrance of whom religion will long preſerve.</p>
                     <p>HER daughter ſurvived her only a few days. But her ſons, not regardleſs of the inſtructions which they had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, did honour to the memory of their parents, by lives wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of their birth and their education.</p>
