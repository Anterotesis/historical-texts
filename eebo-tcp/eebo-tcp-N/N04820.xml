            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But the Caſe is otherwiſe in the Controverſy now before us; the Subject whereof <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> any light Matter, or bare Circumſtantial of Chriſtianity: But 'tis one of the great <hi>Things</hi> of the Goſpel; nothing leſs than wherein the Nature and Extent of the <hi>Goſpel it ſelf,</hi> and <hi>New Covenant,</hi> therein revealed, conſiſts.— So that on what Side of this Debate, the <hi>Truth</hi> lies, there lies the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> of Grace, and real Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt: But, on the other Side lies <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Covenant,</hi> and <hi>another Goſpel,</hi> as to this Particular, a Covenant of <hi>Man's</hi> own deviſing, a Goſpel ſuch as <hi>Divine</hi> Revelation knows nothing of.</p>
            <p>We, on the one Hand, readily own, that the <hi>New Covenant</hi> promſis <hi>eternal Life</hi> to <hi>unſeigned Faith, Repentance, Love,</hi> &amp;c. And in a Word, to all <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> thence ariſing; which in a Goſpel-Senſe is termed, <hi>Good Works, Fruits of Righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. But then (as is obſerved in the following Papers) we are expreſly taught by the Holy Ghoſt, that none ſuch car be performed by us, <hi>previous</hi> to our Regeneration.</p>
            <p>Moreover, it is readily acknowledged by us, that the <hi>Encouragement</hi> given to all, to whom the Goſpel is publiſh'd, to labour after a ſaving Compliance therewith, is great; and ſuch as by an infinite Wiſdom is ſated to the State of the fallen Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: But ſtill, ſhort of a <hi>Promiſe,</hi> aſcertaining the Succeſs of his Endeavours

               </gap> on the other Hand, if it be given meerly in the Way of <hi>Sovereignty,</hi> and not at all, in the Way of GOD's performing any gracious Promiſe of his, made to the Doings of the Sinner, then it muſt be very wrong for the Sinner to ſeek it as a Bleſſing <hi>promiſ'd</hi> him, to which he has or may have a <hi>Covenant-Right</hi> by any Doings of his, in his unregenerate State: Becauſe that would be to ſeek it in an. <hi>An <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>criptural</hi> Way, a Way in which GOD hath never by any Engagement of his given him the leaſt Encouragement to expect the Beſtowment to it.—And if this latter be the Caſe, it muſt then certainly follow, that all Preſence of <hi>preaching the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Chriſt,</hi> under this Head of urging Sinners upon ſeeking after renewing Grace as <hi>promiſed</hi> to their own Doings, is ſo far from preaching the true Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, as that 'tis in Reality a <hi>perverting the Goſpel,</hi> or preaching con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it: And is ſo much worſe to than nothing, in this Particular, as the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller's being directed to a wrong Road, is worſe than no Direction at all; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, that, inſtead of forwarding his Journey, at leaſt greatly retards it.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak plainly here, ſuch is the Tenor of the New Covenant, according to the Doctor (if I underſtand him at all) that the <hi>Sinner,</hi> which receives the <hi>ſpecial Grace</hi> of GOD for the Renovation of his Nature to Holineſs, receives it as much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>th Way of <hi>Covenant Right,</hi> by his Works, whilſt Unregenerate, as the <hi>Saint</hi> in Chriſt Jeſus receives the Reward of future Glory by a <hi>Covenant Right,</hi> ariſing from a Compliance with Goſpel-Terms.</p>
            <p>Such a <hi>Scheme</hi> of the Covenant as this (I acknowledge) I have never yet been all to ſee in the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi> — And therefore, I have endeavoured in the following Sheets (after what has been thought ſufficient, is replaced to the <hi>Doctor's</hi> Letter) to evidence from various Arguments, that this Notion of the New Covenant is merely humane, what neither is, nor can be divine, according to the Revelation, which GOD) has given us of his Mind and Will.</p>
            <p>It may perhaps be expected, that I make ſome Apology for my publiſhing this Reply to the <hi>Doctor's Letter,</hi> as it appears now <hi>out of Seaten</hi>; not only becauſe, it is

ſome Time ſince his Letter came abroad; but eſpecially becauſe it hath already received a ſufficient Anſwer from the Rev. Mr. <hi>Dickinſon;</hi> after which it may be thought, nothing further can be needful.—</p>
            <p>I would ſay them, 1ſt. That when I entered upon this Affair, it was with a View, that the <hi>Dr</hi>'s Letter was not like to receive any Anſwer at all. — And therefore, though I knew my ſelf one of the leaſt among my Brethren, and by no Means able to give the Cauſe that fall Advantage, which Truth would allow: Yet taking of to be the Cauſe of GOD, and of common Concern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>2dly.</hi> Though the Sufficiency of Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi>'s Reply be fully conceeded, as to be ſure it is by me; Nevertheleſs, doubtleſs, this will be allowed by all, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever well Error is demonſtrated againſt, and Truth vindicated by one, yet ſtill the ſane Thing being done by another Hand in a <hi>different</hi> Manner, tends to Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And uſually carries this Advantage with it, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſome who did not ſo clearly ſee Truth in the former Repreſentation, will more clearly diſcern it in the latter: And that, even, when the latter is greatly inferior to the former; which I am ſenſible is the preſent Caſe; and yet I conceive it poſſible, that even this Meanneſs may ſerve the better to accomodate what is ſaid, to the Underſtanding and Acceptation of the more Illiterate. Upon this View, together with their Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I have by the Importunity of Friends, been prevailed on to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <hi>A</hi> LETTER <hi>to the Rev. Dr.</hi> JOHNSON, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Rev. Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAVING been requeſted by a Friend, to make ſuch <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks</hi> on that Part of your late Performance, intitled, <hi>A</hi> LETTER from <hi>Ariſtocles</hi> to <hi>Authades,</hi> which relates to the <hi>Promiſes,</hi> as to me might appear neceſſary, for the <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication</hi> of ſome of the great and precious Truths of the <hi>Goſpel</hi>; and having taken ſaid <hi>Letter,</hi> in that Part, under Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it appears to me moſt unexceptionable, in a Matter of ſo great Importance, as that of the <hi>Cauſe of GOD,</hi> wherein (as you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) <hi>the eternal Salvation of Souls is very nearly concerned,</hi> to appear open and free and as I truſt, you will find me equally far from a <hi>diſputatious Temper,</hi> as you profeſs your ſelf to be, ſo I hope I ſhall find my ſelf, by your own Example, ſecured of a kind and candid Acceptance. Therefore I ſhall, without any further Apology, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs my ſelf to you, Sir, in what I have to offer on this Head.</p>
            <p>Now that our Readers may have a clear Underſtanding of this Matter, I think it proper to be noticed, that what gave Occaſion to your <hi>Letter,</hi> was a <hi>Sermon</hi> publiſhed by the Rev. Mr. <hi>Cooke</hi> of <hi>Stratfield,</hi> in Vindication of the <hi>Sovereignty of GOD,</hi> in the Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his <hi>ſpecial Grace</hi> to loſt Sinners, on <hi>Exod.</hi> XXXiii. 18. In the Improvement of which Sermon it is inferred, <hi>That there are no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of ſpecial Grace made unto any Doings of the Unregenerate, by the Performance of which they might become intitied to it.</hi> Accordingly your <hi>Letter</hi> conſiſts of two Parts; the Former on the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> of GOD, the Latter on the Promiſes. It is the <hi>Latter,</hi> that I am here principally concerned with.</p>
            <p>Having finiſhed the former Head of Diſcourſe, you introduce the latter in the following Words. Pag. 22. <hi>Indeed you was then only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking to prove, that there are no Promiſes in the Scripture to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate; [meaning by the Unregenerate, thoſe (whether baptized, or not) who are under the Dominion and Guilt of Sin.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:006010_0008_102771692FB8C430"/>Here, that I may proceed with the greater Clearneſs, I ſhall</p>
            <p>I. State the <hi>Queſtion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. Conſider what is offer'd by you to <hi>invalidate</hi> the Rev. Mr. <hi>Cooke</hi>'s Arguments advanced in his <hi>Sermon,</hi> in Favour of the <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Side of the Queſtion.</p>
            <p>III. Conſider what you have offer'd in Confirmation of the <hi>affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative.</hi> And then,</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Suggeſt a few Things to Conſideration which ſerve, among many others, to perſuade me, that the Truth lies on the <hi>Negative</hi> Side.</p>
            <p>According to this Method, I am</p>
            <p>I. To State <hi>the Queſtion.</hi>—Now in Order to this it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, That the <hi>Queſtion</hi> between Mr. <hi>Cooke</hi> and you is not, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any Promiſes in the Bible</hi>? Which you ſeem, wildly enough, to inſinuate. (<hi>Page</hi> 21, 22, 23.)—Nor is it,</p>
            <p>Whether there are any conditional Promiſes made to Sinners in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Neither is it,</hi> Whether it be the Sinner's indiſpenſable Duty, in the Uſe of appointed Means, earneſtly to ſeek after the Attainment of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace?—<hi>Nor yet,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether God's Beſtowment of ſpecial Grace upon Sinners be ordinarily in the Way of the Sinners diligent, earneſt, and painful Endeavours, in the Uſe of appointed Means? <hi>Nor,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether the Encouragement Sinner's have, in the Goſpel, to hope that Succeſs may attend their thus ſeeking, be very great and precious?</p>
            <p>Nor yet,</p>
            <p>Whether the Sinner's Encouragement to hope for the Succeſs of his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, riſes in Proportion to his Diligence and Painfulneſs in the Uſe of appointed Means?—<hi>None of all theſe properly belong to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy in Hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You do indeed, Sir, charge Mr. <hi>Cooke,</hi> in ſome of his Expreſſions, with denying there are any <hi>Promiſes</hi> at all in the Scripture, <hi>Pag.</hi> 22. But yet at the ſame Time you are oblig'd to confeſs, <hi>That he was only undertaking to prove there were no Promiſes, in the Scripture, to the Unregenerate.</hi> So that it is evident, you did not really un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand him to mean, what you inſinuate his Words ſpeak.</p>
            <p>But to come directly to the Caſe.—</p>
            <p>The <hi>Queſtion</hi> properly now before us is, <hi>Whether there be Promiſes of the Beſtowment of ſpecial Grace, made in the Scripture to unregenerate Sinners, on Condition of any Endeavours, Strivings, or Doings of theirs whatſoever?</hi> or, which amounts to much the ſame,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:006010_0009_1027717F6E91DC18"/>Whether God beſtows ſpecial Grace on the Unregenerate, in the Way of performing a Covenant-Promiſe made to any Doings of theirs whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; allowing that Promiſe, both as to the Matter and Being of it, to be of Meer Grace?</p>
            <p>The Queſtion being thus fairly ſtated, the Buſineſs is brought into a narrow Compaſs; and had you proved either of theſe, both had readily been granted; But Nothing of this Nature hath hitherto been found in your <hi>Letter.</hi> You do indeed, once and again, inſiſt upon it, <hi>That in the final Retributions to be awarded to Men in the Life to come, God acts as a righteous judge of the Behaviour of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and rewards or puniſhes according to Stipulation; and that in this grand affair abſolute Sovereignty has no Place.</hi> Pag. 6, 20.—And who of us ever entertained one ſingle Thought to the contrary? What therefore, Sir, you would be at, in inſiſting ſo much on this Point, I am unable to conceive; unleſs you would hereby inſinuate to the World, that the Rev. Author of that <hi>Sermon,</hi> referr'd to in your Letter, is of a contrary Mind, and if ſo, you had done well to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce your Evidence.—Or,</p>
            <p>Can it once be imagined, that becauſe God acts as a Judge in the final Retributions to be awarded to Men, at the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, therefore he acts as a Judge alſo in the Beſtowment of effectual Grace here in this World, while in a State of Probation? Where is the Connection between theſe Things? Eſpecially, ſince you concede, <hi>That God is entirely ſovereign and arbitrary as a Benefactor in the Diſtribution of his Talents and Favours, both ſpiritual and temporal, as proper Means of Trial and Probation in this World, i.e.</hi> (ſay you) <hi>the various Abilities, Capacities, Priviledges and Advantages be beſtows on Mankind: He is intirely at Liberty</hi> (meaning as to theſe Things) <hi>to do what he will with his own.</hi> Pag. 6.— Now is not ſpecial Grace, beſtowed on Men in this World, a <hi>Favour,</hi> a <hi>Priviledge,</hi> and an <hi>Advantage</hi> to thoſe on whom it is beſtowed? And is it not a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Talent,</hi> given for Improvement, as a proper Means of Trial and Probation here? Eſpecially ſince, according to your own Notion of Things, <hi>it may be, and oftentimes is loſt for want of Improvement, and it's Avail to the eternal Salvation of any one, is intirely owing to a due Improvement.</hi> —So that I ſee not, but that according to your own Account, taken in your own Words, the great God is Lord of his own, with Reſpect as well to the Beſtowment of ſpecial Grace, as other ſpiritual Priviledges and Talents diſpenſed to Men under the Goſpel.—</p>
            <p>If you ſay, <hi>Nay,</hi> but God beſtows ſpecial Grace, not as a <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor,</hi> but as a Righteous <hi>Judge</hi> of the Behaviour of his Creatures,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:006010_0010_1026E52A1671AE88"/>
I anſwer, This is the Thing you ſhould have proved; and had you done <hi>this,</hi> inſtead of explaining <hi>your Way of thinking</hi> ſo largely, you had done ſomething to the Purpoſe: but ſo long as this is not done, you have really done juſt Nothing. For it is not Acquaintance with your Way of thinking, which we want; but Evidence, that your Way of thinking is grounded upon the <hi>Word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, it appears to me, you have abundantly conceded, that God acts as a <hi>Benefactor</hi> in the Beſtowment of ſpecial Grace, when in Pag. 8. you grant that <hi>Every Thing beyond what is juſt ſufficient to render Being deſirable, even to a perfect Creature how obedient ſoever, is Matter of meer ſovereign Goodneſs, in which God may go into what Variety be pleaſes: Much more</hi> (ſay you) <hi>muſt the whoſe Syſtem of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to fallen Man be Matter of meer ſovereign free Grace.</hi>— Now if the whole Syſtem of the Goſpel beſtow'd on fallen Man, in this State of Probation, be, in an eminent Degree, Matter of <hi>meer ſovereign free Grace,</hi> becauſe it goes far beyond what is juſt ſufficient to render Being deſirable, Why is not the Beſtowment of <hi>ſpecial</hi> Grace on ſome of the fallen Race, in this State of Probation, at leaſt in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Degree, Matter of <hi>meer ſovereign free Gift?</hi> Is not the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowment of <hi>ſpecial</hi> Grace on ſome of the fallen Race, at leaſt as much beyond what is juſt ſufficient to render Being deſirable, as the Syſtem of the Goſpel; ſince the former is the End, and Deſign of the latter?— Again,</p>
            <p>You acknowledge, that <hi>common</hi> Grace is given of God, as a <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor</hi>; your Words are, <hi>abſolutely given in Chriſt to all,</hi> Page 25. By which I preſume you intend, <hi>Given</hi> in a Way of <hi>Sovereignty,</hi> by an <hi>abſolute Proprietor.</hi> And if ſo, then I ask, Since God beſtows <hi>common</hi> Grace as a <hi>ſovereign Benefactor,</hi> why not <hi>ſpecial</hi> Grace too? Seeing according to you, <hi>ſpecial</hi> and <hi>common</hi> Grace differ in Degree only, not in <hi>Kind</hi>; ſo that all that is neceſſary in Order to render <hi>common</hi> Grace, where it is beſtowed on any, <hi>ſpecial,</hi> is only the Addition of ſome further Degrees of the ſame <hi>Kind.</hi> And ſince you grant, that God beſtows ſome <hi>Degrees</hi> of <hi>common</hi> Grace, as a <hi>Benefactor,</hi> in the Way of <hi>Sovereignty,</hi> How does it appear, that God never <hi>adds</hi> ſuch further <hi>Degrees</hi> of the ſame Kind, as are neceſſary to render it <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial,</hi> in the ſame Way of Sovereignty? Eſpecially ſince you grant, as above, that <hi>What is beyond what is juſt ſufficient to render Being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable,</hi> — <hi>God may go into what Variety be pleaſes.</hi> i.e. There is no Objection juſtly lying againſt it (according to you) if God pleaſes to add thoſe further Degrees of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſame <hi>Kind,</hi> that are neceſſary to render <hi>common</hi> Grace, where it is beſtowed, <hi>ſpecial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſtill more expreſs, if it be poſſible, is what you ſay in Page
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006010_0011_102771AE88BC2908"/>
5, 6. where you tell us; <hi>In Order to think clearly on this Subject,— it ſeems, to you, very neceſſary to diſtinguiſh between the Conſideration of God as a Benefactor, and as a Judge: And between the Beſtowment of various Talents and Favours upon Men in this Life, which is a State of Probation, and the Retributions to be awarded in the Life to come, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what Uſe they ſhall have made of them here. In the one</hi> (i.e. in the Beſtowment of various Talents and Favours upon Men in this Life, you ſay) <hi>God acts as a ſovereign Lord of his Favours: In the other, as a righteous Judge.</hi> Now is it not certain that the Beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>ſpecial</hi> Grace belongs to the State of <hi>Probation</hi> in this Life, and not to the State of <hi>Retribution</hi> in the Life to come? And is it not certain, that thoſe endowed with this precious <hi>Talent</hi> here, will receive a <hi>Reward</hi> in the Life to come, according to their <hi>Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> here? And if ſo, then, Is it not certain, according to your own Diſtinction, that God acts as a <hi>Benefactor,</hi> and not as a <hi>Judge</hi> in the Beſtowment of it? So that, by your own expreſs Declarations, you ſeem intirely to have given up the Queſtion.— However, I ſhall r.ow proceed, according to what I have propoſed,</p>
            <p>II. To conſider what <hi>you have offered</hi> to invalidate Mr. <hi>Cooke</hi>'s Arguments, advanced in Favour of the <hi>Negative</hi> Part of the Queſtion. Where it is obſervable, after you have propoſed the Queſtion, as above, your firſt Attack is by way of Query, thus; <hi>But, pray Sir, how did you prove it? Why by this Argument</hi>; <q>If God had bound himſelf by his <hi>Promiſe,</hi> to any of his Creatures, he is no more at perfect <hi>Liberty,</hi> either to grant, or with-hold the promiſed Bleſſing, as may pleaſe him.</q>—<hi>Now</hi> (ſay you) <hi>ſurely if this Argument proves any Thing, it proves that no Promiſe at all, to Good, or Bad, is conſiſtent with the divine Sovereignty</hi>; and ſo on.—</p>
            <p>Here, Sir, you muſt have Patience with me, whilſt: I attempt to ſet this Matter in a true Light; becauſe, I apprehend, you have at leaſt, when we have made the beſt of it, here committed a <hi>Blundery,</hi> and then made your own Miſtake the intire Ground of your break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out into ſome warm Reflections upon the Rev. Mr. <hi>Cooke,</hi> Author of the <hi>Sermon</hi> referr'd to; as excluding the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>holy Scriptures,</hi> as an <hi>utterly ſenſeleſs</hi> and <hi>unmeaning Thing.</hi> P. 21, 22. An awful Charge this! and ſtill more ſo to him that brings it againſt another, if founded intirely on his own <hi>Miſtake.</hi> Now, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſet this Matter in a clear View, it may not be amiſs, to take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that the Argument quoted by you is fetcht from the <hi>Author</hi>'s Improvement of that Subject, in the Way of <hi>Inference,</hi> viz: <q>That it is a great <hi>Miſtake,</hi> and of very <hi>dangerous</hi> Conſequence, which many carnal Perſon under the Light of the Goſpel fall into, who
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006010_0012_102771B022BC0760"/>
will perſuade themſelves, that they are <hi>able</hi> (with the common Concurrence of divine Providence in upholding their Beings and Faculties) to <hi>do that</hi> which hath a certain <hi>Connection</hi> with, or which ſhall <hi>aſſuredly iſſue in,</hi> their <hi>Converſion</hi> and eternal Salvation.</q> (<hi>Serm.</hi> Pag. 16.) That is, as the <hi>Author</hi> abundantly explains him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, throughout the following Part of that Diſcourſe, <q>They per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelves, that they are able to <hi>do that,</hi> which will <hi>intitle</hi> them to certain <hi>Promiſes</hi> of the Beſtowment of <hi>effectual Grace.</hi>
               </q>— And having ſaid ſeveral Things for the Illuſtration of this Point, he at length argues in this Form, <hi>viz:</hi> 
               <q>If God be a <hi>Sovereign</hi> Diſpenſer of his ſaving Graces and Favours, and may grant or with-hold them, according to his <hi>meer good Pleaſure,</hi> as I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured before to ſhew; then Sinners in their <hi>natural</hi> State have no <hi>Claim</hi> to the <hi>Promiſes.</hi>
               </q>—The Form of Reaſoning here made uſe of, is plainly that of an <hi>hypothetic</hi> Syllogiſm.—The <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,</hi> or Minor Propoſition, viz. <q>
                  <hi>That God is a ſovereign Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſer of his ſaving Grace, and may give, or with hold it, according to his meer good Pleaſure,</hi>
               </q> This the Author intimates he had before made good. The <hi>Conſequence</hi> is clear and undeniable, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That if God be a <hi>Sovereign</hi> Diſpenſer of his ſaving Grace to Sinners, may grant, or with-hold it, according to his meer good Pleaſure, then, <hi>Sinners have no Claim to it by gracious Promiſes made by God to any Doings of theirs.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now the whole Deſign of the <hi>Author</hi> in the Uſe of thoſe Words (quoted by you) was to confirm this <hi>Conſequence</hi>; and lay open the <hi>Inconſiſtency</hi> there is, between God's beſtowing ſaving Grace on the Sinner, in the way of <hi>ſovereign free Favour,</hi> as being at perfect <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi> either to grant, or with-hold it, according to his meer good Pleaſure,—And his acting herein at the ſame time in the Character of a Judge or Rewarder, <hi>obliged</hi> by his <hi>Promiſes</hi> to the Doings of the Sinner. And the Words fully anſwer the Purpoſe, for which they were uſed; for if God once makes a <hi>Promiſe</hi> to his Creatures, he is no more at perfect <hi>Liberty,</hi> whether to grant, or withhold the promiſed Bleſſing. So that the <hi>Inconſiſtency</hi> between theſe two is equal to that of the ſame Perſon's being <hi>bound</hi> and <hi>free,</hi> at the ſame Time, and in the ſame Reſpect: Things impoſſible in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, oppoſite States, Contraries, that can never agree to one and the ſame Perſon. So that if one of theſe be <hi>true,</hi> the other muſt neceſſarily be <hi>falſe.</hi> Thus it is evident, the Words you quote, do fully prove what they were brought to prove.</p>
            <p>Now inſtead of properly denying any Part of the Argument, or diſcovering any Weakneſs in it, you only with great Aſſurance af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006010_0013_102771B1AE1DE880"/>
that <hi>ſurely if this Argument proves any Thing, it proves that no</hi> Promiſe <hi>at all, to God or Bad, is conſiſtent with the Divine</hi> Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: <hi>and then where is there any Place for any</hi> New Covenant, <hi>or indeed</hi> Old <hi>either? And if the Caſe be ſo</hi> (ſay you) <hi>away with the Bible ſure enough?</hi> and ſo on.</p>
            <p>But pray, Sir, think a little, whether you have Truth with you, in what you here affirm. You ſay, <hi>If this Argument proves any Thing, it proves that no Promiſe as all, to God or Bad, is conſiſtent with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Sovereignty</hi>—With your Leave, Sir, Had you here juſtly and carefully diſtinguiſhed, and ſaid, This Argument proves, that no Promiſe at all to Good or Bad, is conſiſtent with abſolute <hi>Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> in Reſpect to conferring the Good promiſed: <hi>i.e.</hi> That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God acts not as a <hi>Sovereign,</hi> at perfect Liberty, to grant, or to with-hold the Good promiſed; becauſe, in that Particular, he hath <hi>obliged</hi> himſelf by his gracious <hi>Promiſe</hi>: you had expreſſed your ſelf much more agreeable to the <hi>Truth.</hi> This is what that Argument was brought to prove, and undeniably does prove.—But, <hi>Dear Sir,</hi> How does this exclude the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> or not leave any <hi>Place for it</hi>? or how does it <hi>contemn the Sacred Scriptures, as a meer Impoſture, a meer Force, and utterly a ſenſeleſs and unmeaning Thing</hi>? Had you, Sir, kept to Truth in this Inſtance, you had ſaved all thoſe hard Speeches, with which you fill up a great Part of three Pages together, (p. 21, 22, 23.)</p>
            <p>However, granting, this Argument proves, as is above conceded, yet how does it from hence appear, that <hi>no Promiſe,</hi> to Good or Bad, is <hi>ſo</hi> conſiſtent with the divine <hi>Sovereignty,</hi> as to allow any Place for <hi>New Covenant,</hi> or <hi>Old</hi> either, or the <hi>Being</hi> of any Promiſes at all! This is what you confidently enough affirm, that the Argument proves, if it proves any Thing. But this is your own grand Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take: you have, in this particular, evidently gone beyond the Truth. How do you infer, that <hi>if God's obliging himſelf by gracious Promiſes, to any of his Creatures, be inconſiſtent with his being at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to giant or with-hold the Thing promiſed, then it is inconſiſtent alſo with his making any Promiſes at all, or entering into any Covenant at all!</hi> I can't ſee how God's being <hi>obliged</hi> by his Promiſes, <hi>when made</hi> to any of his Creatures, and ſo not being at Liberty to perform, or not perform them, as he pleaſeth, does in the leaſt militate againſt the <hi>Being</hi> of any Promiſes at all, or ſubvert the New Covenant.</p>
            <p>Further,</p>
            <p>Are not the <hi>Author</hi>'s Words, which you quote, and call <hi>this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,</hi> moſt evidently <hi>true</hi>? Nay, are they not ſo true, as that, from Reaſon, Scripture, and the Attributes of God, it is impoſſible
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:006010_0014_102771BAAFA743B8"/>
they ſhould be otherwiſe than true? For if a Promiſe made to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be, in it's own Nature, <hi>binding,</hi> and God be a God of <hi>Truth,</hi> who <hi>cannot lie,</hi> then it is impoſſible but that, if God makes a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to any of his Creatures, it muſt be binding, and his Truth obliges him to Performance. Which is the Sum total of what is contained in the Author's Words. And if ſo, how was it poſſible, Sir, that you ſhould make (ſhall I ſay?) ſuch dreadful Work, with a plain, rational, ſcriptural Truth, as on the Account thereof, to throw out thoſe black Imputations on the Rev. <hi>Author</hi>! However, I charitably hope and believe that all this, in you, ariſes from nothing worſe than a groſs Miſtake, and may be imputed to a too haſty Proceeding, without clear Ideas. Yet in Faithfulneſs to the Cauſe of Truth, and to you, Rev. Sir, I muſt obſerve, 'tis evidently ſuch a Miſtake as is very <hi>blame-worthy,</hi> and ſcarce excuſable.—And that,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe on this <hi>Miſtake</hi> alone you evidently ground all thoſe <hi>cenſorious,</hi> and <hi>unchriſtian Reflections</hi> you make on the Rev. Mr. <hi>Cooke,</hi> in your Letter, <hi>Pag.</hi> 21, 22, 23. Where you repreſent him as one <hi>flying in the Face of the whole Scriptures; denying any Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes at all—deſtroying the very Being of the New Covenant—and by Conſequence, of the whole Deſign, and Purport of all revealed Religion!</hi> This you confeſs is a <hi>heavy Charge,</hi> and grieve over the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness having brought it upon himſelf, and then reſolve all into this, as the Means by which he has done it, <hi>viz.</hi> his having aſſerted, that, <hi>If God had once bound himſelf by his Promiſe to any of his Creatures, be is no more at perfect Liberty either to grant or with-hold the promiſed Bleſſing, as may pleaſe him, but is inviolably holden by his own Promiſe.</hi> A Truth, as evident both from <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> (and as inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently aſſerted) as any other Truth in the whole Book of God: And yet, by ſome unknown Art of yours, the Rev. Author muſt be thus blackned! How is it poſſible for Innocence it ſelf to eſcape, where men will allow themſelves in ſuch Treatment of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another Aggravation attending this Miſtake, is, that it was committed in a Caſe ſo exceeding <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>eaſy</hi>; that it is ſcarce conceivable, how any one unprejudic'd and duly diſpoſed (though but of a common Capacity) ſhould fall into it.—Had the Caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired uncommon Sagacity, deep Penetration, or accurate Diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in order to diſtinguiſh between God's Promiſes obliging him ſo as to be inconſiſtent with his being at perfect Liberty, either to perform or not perform them, <hi>when made,</hi> and their obliging him ſo as to be inconſiſtent with their <hi>being made</hi> at all,—the Miſtake had
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:006010_0015_102771BC575079B0"/>
been much more excuſable. But ſince thoſe Ideas are, not only diſtinct, but very manifeſtly ſo, it is hardly conceivable, how any one ſhould imagine ſuch a Connexion, or ſo near a Relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, as that the one ſhould be infer'd from the other; which is the preſent Caſe.</p>
            <p>To conclude this Particular, though I am reſolved, ſo far as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, conſiſtent with Truth, to be on the charitable Side: Yet I can do no leſs than refer it to your own ſerious Conſideration, whether it be not evidently from your own intire <hi>Miſtake,</hi> at leaſt, that you charge all thoſe frightful Things mentioned on the Rev. Author: And if you find this to be the Caſe, I would charitably hope, you will give the World Conviction by your Practice, as well as by your Words (Page 1.) <hi>That you deſire nothing more, than to know the Truth, that you may be governed by it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You go on to produce ſome Proof, <hi>that there are Promiſes, in the Scriptures</hi>: what no one, I ſuppoſe, ever denied. You appeal to any Man of common Senſe, that reads the <hi>Bible</hi> carefully, whether there be not <hi>Promiſes</hi> in it: And then very gravely quote 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. to prove the Point. Here I ſhall only appeal, with you, to any Man of common Senſe, whether this Management be not trifling, and unworthy a grave Divine? But you carry on your Appeal ſtill further, and expoſtulate, "<hi>Whether it be not manifeſtly the Deſign and Tendency of the whole Scriptures, from the Beginning to the End, to inculcate theſe two Points,</hi> viz. <hi>To put Mankind upon the moſt vigorous Activity in ſeeking and purſuing their everlaſting Happineſs</hi>; and then <hi>to aſcertain to them Succeſs in ſo doing</hi>?" Is it not (<hi>ſay you</hi>) one of the firſt Things you read in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> after the Fall (4. 7.) <hi>If thou doſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted</hi>? And the laſt in <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> (22. 14) <hi>Bleſſed are they that do his Commandments, that they may have a Right to the Tree of Life</hi>?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, If theſe qualifying Words, viz. <hi>through well doing,</hi> be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, either expreſly or implicitly, to your Propoſitions, they are both true, and can be made good from the Scriptures: otherwiſe they are both falſe; for the Scripture no where puts Mankind upon ſeeking their everlaſting Happineſs, or aſcertains them Succeſs in the Purſuit, in any other Way than that of <hi>Well-doing,</hi> truly ſuch in the Account of <hi>God, i. e.</hi> Doing <hi>his Commandments</hi>; which being thus underſtood (as certainly they muſt be, in order either to their being true, or there being any Pertinency in the <hi>Texts</hi> brought for their Proof) what is there in them to your Purpoſe? Will the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence hold good, That, becauſe God has promiſed <hi>eternal Life</hi> to thoſe, who do his Commandments (who in the Way of <hi>Well-doing
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006010_0016_102771C3D88C7838"/>
ſeek for Glory</hi>) Therefore he has promiſed the Beſtowment of <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace,</hi> to the Doings of the <hi>Unregenerate,</hi> that are under the Guilt and Dominion of Sin?</p>
            <p>How then you ſhould once imagine (if really you did ſo) that theſe <hi>Texts</hi> had any Reference to the Queſtion in Hand, is beyond me to conceive; unleſs it ſhould be ſuppoſed, that <hi>well-doing</hi> in the Account of God, or (which is the ſame) <hi>Doing his Commandments,</hi> ſo as to have <hi>Right to the Tree of Life,</hi> is what agrees to the <hi>Unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi> under the Guilt and Dominion of Sin: which certainly none will pretend to.</p>
            <p>Beſides, Is it not exceeding clear from the Occaſion and Deſign of thoſe Words, quoted from <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 7. (if intended in a Goſpel-Senſe) That by <hi>well-doing</hi> there muſt be meant Nothing ſhort of Compliance with the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> preſenting Services, and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings to the bleſſed God with a Reſpect had to the <hi>Mediator,</hi> by <hi>Faith,</hi> for their <hi>Acceptance?</hi> And is it not expreſly witneſſed by the Holy Ghoſt (in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 4.) <hi>That by Faith</hi> Abel <hi>offer'd a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Sacrifice than</hi> Cain? And if ſo, is it not certain that <hi>Cain</hi>'s not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering his Sacrifice in <hi>Faith</hi> was his <hi>doing not well,</hi> ſo that <hi>Sin lay at the Door,</hi> and ſtood in the Way of God's gracious <hi>Acceptance</hi>? Is it not alſo abundantly evident, that the Deſign of the Lord's Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning with <hi>Cain,</hi> wherein theſe Words are made Uſe of, was to point out to him his own <hi>Sin,</hi> as the true Ground of that <hi>Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> (whereat he was much offended) made by the holy God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Sacrifice and his Brother's, in point of <hi>Acceptance</hi>; And thereby to ſet before him Matter of Conviction, that <hi>his Anger</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and againſt his Brother, was intirely groundleſs?—<hi>And the Lord ſaid unto</hi> Cain, <hi>Why art thou wroth? And why is thy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance fallen? If thou doſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted</hi>? i. e. (according to good Expoſitors) If thou hadſt <hi>done well,</hi> as thy Brother did, thou ſhouldſt have been <hi>accepted</hi> as he was, <hi>viz.</hi> If thou hadſt offer'd thy Sacrifice in <hi>Faith,</hi> with an Eye to the <hi>Mediator</hi> for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cceptance, thou hadſt been equally <hi>accepted</hi> of God with thy Brother. <hi>And if thou doſt not well, Sin lieth at the Door,</hi> i. e. If through the Pride of thine Heart, not duly conſidering thy own Sinfulneſs, or the infinite Purity of my Nature, and that the Way of Life by the firſt Covenant, the Way of <hi>immediate</hi> Approach to, and Acceptance with God, by any Services or Offerings whatſoever, is by Man's Apoſtacy intirely and for ever ſhut up, and awfully guarded by a Band of Angels, and a flaming Sword, that turns every Way to keep the Way of the <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> i. e. that Way of Life by Man's <hi>doing the Law,</hi> or perſonal Obedience, the <hi>Doing</hi> in order to Life pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:006010_0017_102771C55CFA55C0"/>
in the <hi>firſt Covenant,</hi> which (it ſeems) the Uſe of the <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> as a Sacrament of that Covenant, was deſign'd to ratify and confirm, and that the only Way now of Approach to, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with an infinitely holy God, for the fallen Creature, is by <hi>Faith</hi> in the <hi>Mediator</hi>; If thus arrogantly, in thy own Self-ſufficiency, thou haſt preſumed to approach unto God, and preſent thy Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a meer moral or legal, and <hi>immediate</hi> Way, and not by <hi>Faith</hi> in the <hi>Mediation</hi> of the promiſed <hi>Seed,</hi> in this <hi>thou haſt done not well,</hi> ſo that <hi>Sin lieth at the Door:</hi> this thy <hi>Unbelief binds Sin</hi> upon thee, expoſes thee to Puniſhment, and is a Bar in the Way of any the leaſt Expreſſion of my <hi>Reſpect</hi> to thee or thy Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And of theſe Things you have had proper Notice, as well as your Brother: therefore if after all you will dare thus preſumptuouſly to approach me in this antiquated <hi>legal</hi> Way, and not in the <hi>new</hi> and <hi>living Way,</hi> through a <hi>Mediator,</hi> you can blame only your own Folly for the Diſappointment you are angry at.</p>
            <p>Now that this is the plain Meaning of theſe Expreſſions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued in an Evangelical Senſe, and in Analogy with the Chriſtian Revelation, is evident. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is certain, <hi>Cain</hi>'s <hi>Fault</hi> in this Matter muſt be, at leaſt eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, his <hi>not</hi> offering his Sacrifice in <hi>Faith,</hi> reſpecting the <hi>Mediator,</hi> the promiſed <hi>Seed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It is certain, the Lord's <hi>Deſign,</hi> by Reaſoning with him, in the Uſe of theſe Words, muſt be, to <hi>point out</hi> to him his <hi>Fault,</hi> in this Matter.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is therefore certain, that theſe Expreſſions, <hi>If thou doſt not well,</hi> muſt point out his Fault in <hi>not</hi> offering his Sacrifice in <hi>Faith,</hi> and conſequently that the <hi>doing Well,</hi> ſpoken of as that upon which he ſhould have been <hi>accepted,</hi> muſt mean his <hi>offering his Sacrifice in Faith</hi>: for if his <hi>Unbelief</hi> was that <hi>not doing well,</hi> whereby he failed of Acceptance, then his <hi>Faith</hi> muſt be that <hi>doing well,</hi> which would have ſecured his Acceptance.— Upon the whole therefore, if by <hi>doing well</hi> here, as ſpoken of to <hi>Cain,</hi> be meant his complying with the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> approaching to God through a <hi>Mediator,</hi> and preſenting his Offerings <hi>in his Name,</hi> and if this be evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with his <hi>Acceptance</hi> with God, or his having Right to any the leaſt Expreſſion of God's <hi>Favour,</hi> How is it poſſible by this <hi>Text</hi> to prove, or from it juſtly to inſinuate, That the <hi>Unregenerate,</hi> under the Guilt and Dominion of Sin, i. e. Short of Faith in the Mediator, have a Right to the Beſtowment of <hi>ſpecial Grace,</hi> by Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of ſome <hi>Promiſe</hi> made (though ſuppoſing it of meer Grace) to certain Doings of their own?— Whether this be not to pervert this
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:006010_0018_102771C86B4E0770"/>
Scripture from it's true Meaning, I refer to all impartial and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Readers.</p>
            <p>But it is eſpecially wonderful to me, Sir, when you ſeemed to fetch ſo large a Compaſs, and carry the whole Scripture before you, from the Beginning of <hi>Geneſis</hi> to the End of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> as tho' every Page and Line were on your Side of the Queſtion, that on ſuch a Survey of the whole ſacred Canon you ſhould fix on <hi>this Text</hi> in particular, as one moſt clear and full to your Purpoſe; a Text which, not only does not contain the leſt Shadow of a Hint in Favour of your Opinion, but is a clear and ſhining Teſtimony againſt it!—</p>
            <p>For,</p>
            <p>If the Performance of that <hi>Duty,</hi> which as to the <hi>general Nature</hi> of it, we are ſure, and for any Thing the Scripture informs us, as to the <hi>particular Circumſtances</hi> attending it (except the Want of <hi>Faith</hi>) was agreeable to the <hi>Will of God,</hi> was notwithſtanding this <hi>rejected</hi> of God for the Want of <hi>Faith</hi>; What clearer Teſtimony can be given, <hi>That God is obliged by no gracious Promiſes, to ſhew his ſpecial Favour to the fallen Creature on any Condition, ſhort of Faith in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator?</hi> Was not <hi>Cain</hi> by awful Experience convinced of this? And does not this Example contain Matter of more powerful Conviction, to all Mankind acquainted with it, than any Declaration by meer Words could do? Inaſmuch as it is a Verification of what God has ſaid, in the <hi>laſt Verſe</hi> of the preceeding <hi>Chapter</hi>: Signifying, that God himſelf, as a conſuming <hi>Fire,</hi> is engaged againſt any of the fallen Race's being entitled to his ſpecial Favour, by any Means whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſhort of <hi>Faith</hi> in the <hi>Mediator.</hi> But to proceed,</p>
            <p>In the next Place you aſſert a <hi>Right,</hi> at leaſt a <hi>conditional Right</hi> to certain Bleſſings, paſſed over to us by the Promiſes.— "<hi>What elſe</hi> (ſay you) <hi>can be made of them, but that God deſigned to paſs over a Right, at leaſt a conditional Right to his Creatures of what he promiſes them</hi>?—The <hi>Matter</hi> and the <hi>

               </gap> a conditional Right.</p>
            <p>Here Sir, I muſt confeſs my ſelf unable, with any Certainty, to fix on your Meaning; And while this is the Caſe, it is impoſſible for me to determine, what I ſhould think proper to reply, in Caſe the Meaning of what is ſaid were aſcertain'd. However, while by this looſe Manner of dealing in doubtful Generals, we are left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of making a pertinent Reply, with any Certainty, to what is intended: Yet at the ſame Time we are ſecured, that ſuch Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:006010_0019_102771CA257E7320"/>
of Dealing can never prove any Thing againſt or hurt the Cauſe, that is thus oppoſed, except it be in the Minds of thoſe, who are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away by Sounds, without any determinate Ideas. Nevertheleſs to make the beſt Gueſs I can in the Caſe.—</p>
            <p>If, by a <hi>conditional Right to the Bleſſings promiſed,</hi> you mean a Right to <hi>Grace and Glory, and every good Thing,</hi> paſs'd over to us in Caſe of an <hi>upright Walk</hi> before God, I readily grant it; and that this Right is given us on the Score of God's meer Grace in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But if you mean (as I think you muſt, in Order to mean any Thing to your Purpoſe) by a <hi>conditional Right to Bleſſings promiſed,</hi> a Right to the Beſtowment of <hi>effectual converting Grace,</hi> paſs'd over to the <hi>Unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate,</hi> on Condition of certain Doings of <hi>theirs</hi>; in this Caſe you proceed on a falſe <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> and evidently take for granted, that very Point in Debate, and which you ſhould have proved. "<hi>In his Right therefore</hi> (ſay you) <hi>we muſt plead, who has purchaſed this Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit for us, and not in the Virtue or Merit of any Thing we do, which we can only humbly conſider as meer Qualifications, neceſſary to render us capable of receiving what God in Chriſt hath freely promiſed.— We muſt plead.</hi>—if you here mean pleading for the Beſtowment of effectual <hi>converting</hi> Grace; and if by <hi>any Thing we do</hi> being <hi>conſidered only at meer Qualifications,</hi> &amp;c. you mean ſomething leſs than what hath in it the Nature of a <hi>Condition,</hi> What is this ſhort of giving up the Queſtion? For if there be no <hi>Conditions</hi> on Man's Part, then ſpecial Grace is not beſtowed in the Way of God's <hi>performing his Promiſe to any Doings</hi> of the Sinner as ſuch. But if, by <hi>our Doings being conſidered only as meer Qualifications,</hi> you mean ſomething that hath in it the Nature of a <hi>Condition,</hi> to which a Promiſe of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowment of effectual converting Grace is annexed, then where is the Injuſtice you charge upon the <hi>Author,</hi> for repreſenting your Doctrine as aſſerting the Sinner's <hi>Right,</hi> ariſing from the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of ſuch <hi>Condition,</hi> and his <hi>pleadable Claim</hi> thereupon to the Good promiſed?</p>
            <p>Again, If, by <hi>the Benefit purchaſed for us,</hi> be meant a <hi>conditional Right to eternal Salvation,</hi> or the <hi>Goſpel</hi> it ſelf, and the Covenant-Promiſes therein, whence ſuch conditional Right ariſeth; it may ſafely be granted, that Chriſt hath purchaſed this Benefit for us.—But if, by <hi>the Benefit purchaſed for us,</hi> you mean, among other Things, a conditional Right to the Beſtowment of <hi>converting Grace,</hi> paſſed over to the <hi>Unregenerate,</hi> in the Goſpel-Promiſe, or a Right granted them on Condition of certain <hi>Doings</hi> of <hi>theirs,</hi> then what you have ſaid in the above-quoted Paſſage is intirely to be ſet aſide, as founded on a Suppoſition not true. The Being of the Sinner's <hi>Right</hi> to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowment
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:006010_0020_102771CC1CB8A940"/>
of converting Grace, by Virtue of any Promiſes made to his own Doings or Endeavours, is the very Thing called in Queſtion and therefore I call it a <hi>Suppoſition not true,</hi> and till it be proved, muſt look upon it in that Light.</p>
            <p>In a Word, what you have ſaid above of a <hi>Conditional Right paſſed over to us,</hi> and <hi>of the Benefit purchaſed for us,</hi> was either meant to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in it the Idea of a conditional <hi>Right</hi> to the Beſtowment of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting</hi> Grace, paſſed over to <hi>unregenerate</hi> Sinners, or not. If this be included, then, for the Reaſons above, what you have ſaid here is to be intirely ſet aſide, together with that you have ſaid of the View in which our <hi>Doings</hi> are humbly to be conſidered. But if <hi>not,</hi> then what you have there ſaid, is nothing to the Purpoſe. And ſo I may paſs on to conſider the Grounds of what you further advance by Way of <hi>Charge</hi> againſt the Rev. <hi>Author,</hi> in the following Words.—</p>
            <p>"<hi>It was therefore</hi> (ſay you) <hi>very unjuſt for you to put Things in ſuch a ridiculous Lights as you did, to talk of</hi> owing, claiming, challenging, <hi>&amp;c. No-Body ever dreamt of uſing ſuch Language to God, which could not become an Angel, much leſs a fallen, ſinful Creature, when the Matter, and indeed the very Being of the Promiſes is Matter of free Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By Way of Reply here, I ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It may be conſidered, that the Author, in making Uſe of theſe Expreſſions, was only deſigning to perſonate thoſe of your Opinion, who maintain, that <hi>converting Grace</hi> is beſtowed according to <hi>Works</hi> done by the <hi>Unregenerate,</hi> under the Dominion and Guilt of Sin, <hi>in the Way of God's performing his Covenant-Engagements,</hi> made to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Seekings</hi> and <hi>Strivings</hi> of theirs. And now becauſe the Author did not ſet himſelf to correct their ſeveral Ways of expreſſing their own Ideas in this Matter;—as one, That <hi>by his Endeavours he was inſured of the Beſtowment of effectual Grace</hi>; Another, That <hi>he was entitled, had a Claim, or Right</hi>:—A Third, That <hi>he was thereby inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted</hi>;—And ſome ſo bold in Expreſſion, as to aſſert, That <hi>God had promiſed to their Endeavours, and by their Endeavours they could therefore challenge</hi>:— Becauſe (I ſay) the Author did not enter into Diſpute with this Sort of People, for their <hi>aſſuming</hi> and <hi>challenging</hi> Language, nor teach them in what Manner of Expreſſion, Perſons of <hi>that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> ſhould addreſs themſelves to God, which did not at all belong to his Subject, but inſtead thereof endeavoured to convince them of the grand <hi>Error at Bottom,</hi> which was the miſtaken Ground of all that Variety of bold Phraſes made Uſe of by them; therefore he is thus very <hi>unjuſt,</hi> in your Judgment: But, I charitably believe, not ſo on this Account, in any other Perſon's in all the World.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is obſervable here, that what you condemn in the Author,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:006010_0021_1026E534F1224EE0"/>
as <hi>unjuſt</hi> and <hi>ſetting Things in a ridiculous Light,</hi> is not the menio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning only of ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of theſe Expreſſions, but of ſuch a <hi>Variety,</hi> and of ſome as well as others; as ſeems evident by your adding an <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (Page 24) Now had the Author mentioned only ſuch Phraſes as ſounded moſt <hi>harſh,</hi> to expreſs that Connexion between the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Unregenerate and the Beſtowment of effectual Grace, maintained by thoſe of your Opinion; or had you condemned only ſuch Expreſſions, I had readily ſo far conceded. But ſince the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor makes Uſe of a great Variety of Expreſſions, and among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of many of the <hi>loweſt</hi> Sort, by which ſuch Connexion can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be expreſſed, ſuch as—the Sinner's being by his Endeavours <hi>Inſured, Aſſured, Intitled, Intereſted;</hi> nay, <q>doing that which hath a <hi>certain Connexion</hi> with, or which ſhall <hi>ſurely iſſue</hi> in their Converſion.</q> (<hi>Ser.</hi> Pag. 16, 17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) And ſince you condemn, in the Author, the Uſe of theſe <hi>loweſt</hi> Expreſſions, by which any <hi>ſure Connexion</hi> between the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's Endeavours, and the Beſtowment of effectual Grace, can poſſibly be expreſs'd; Is not this again entirely to give up the Queſtion? For if the Uſe of the loweſt Expreſſions, by which this <hi>Connexion</hi> can be expreſs'd, is to be condemned as <hi>very unjuſt</hi> and <hi>putting of Things in a ridiculous Light,</hi> it muſt be becauſe there is indeed <hi>no Connexion</hi> between the Doings of the Unregenerate, and the Beſtowment of effectual Grace: And if ſo, then <hi>no Promiſes</hi> made to theſe at all.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon aſſign'd here with a View to make this Charge good againſt the Author, is, <hi>That the Matter, and indeed the very Being of the Promiſes, is Matter of free Grace.</hi> But what Force of Argument does this carry with it? Have not you with your own Pen confuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Reaſon, by what you ſay in your 23d Page? Where, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conceded, That <hi>the Matter and Being of the Promiſes is of meer ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign free Grace,</hi> you ſubjoin, <q>
                  <hi>But ſurely notwithſtanding this, when he has been pleaſed to grant us theſe precious Promiſes, it muſt have been his Deſign to paſs over a Right to us of the Bleſſings promiſed.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now,</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Being</hi> of the <hi>Promiſes</hi> being Matter of <hi>meer</hi> Grace ſhould in <hi>pag.</hi> 23. be <hi>no Reaſon</hi> at all, why a <hi>Right</hi> ſhould <hi>not paſs by ſuch Promiſes,</hi> and yet be aſſigned as a <hi>good Reaſon</hi> (in <hi>p.</hi> 24) to cenſure the <hi>Author</hi> you have in Dealing, as <hi>very unjuſt,</hi> and <hi>ridiculing your Doctrine,</hi> while repreſenting it as aſſerting a <hi>Right paſſed by ſuch Promiſes</hi>; this muſt, I think, be placed among the Inconſiſtencies of your Letter.—So very difficult a thing is it, for any one, in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Error,</hi> conſtantly to ſpeak the ſame Things! And when this is the Caſe, it muſt neceſſarily be equally difficult for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:006010_0022_102771D087851838"/>
to fix upon the true Meaning of ſuch an Author; or indeed for his Anſwerer to confute what is ſaid in one Page, and not at the ſame Time confirm what is ſaid in another—You cloſe the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph before us with a ſummary Reflection: "<hi>Conſidering Things in this Light</hi> [i.e. as the Matter, and indeed the very Being of the Promiſes, is Matter of meer Grace] <hi>then what Senſe is there in your</hi> Categoric Syllogiſm, <hi>and all your other Reaſonings on this Subject</hi>?" Where you profeſſedly offer a View of the Promiſes in <hi>this Light</hi> as a ſufficient <hi>Refutation</hi> of all that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Force hereof having been already conſidered, I refer it to every impartial Judge.—And now paſs on to what I further propoſed,</p>
            <p>III. To conſider what you have offer'd in <hi>Confirmation</hi> of the <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative</hi> Part of the Queſtion.</p>
            <p>Thus the next Paragraph of your <hi>Letter</hi> begins.— <hi>But ſtill you, "inſiſt upon it, that there is no Promiſe to the Unregenerate.</hi>"—Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the <hi>Unregenerate</hi> (as in <hi>pag.</hi> 23. you expreſs your underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Author) <hi>theſe (whether baptized or not) who are under the Dominion and Guilt of Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where, having ſaid ſeveral Things, you demand of the <hi>Author</hi> to tell you, <q>if <hi>there be no</hi> Medium <hi>between an obſtinate relentleſs Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and one that is throughly</hi> regenerate, <hi>in his Senſe of the Word</hi>?</q> And having explained what you mean by a Sinner in a <hi>middle</hi> State, between the <hi>Obſtinate</hi> and the <hi>Regenerate,</hi> viz. <q>
                  <hi>One who is brought by the Aſſiſtance of common Grace—to be ſerious, and really ſolicitous for Salvation, ſo as being deeply ſenſible of his own Guilt and Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, earneſtly to cry to God for Help, and ſtrive in earneſt that he may be qualified for God's Help.—Now</hi> (ſay you) <hi>this is the Man to whom I ſay the Promiſes to divine efficacious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>not yet throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from Sin to God,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Here, ſince you confidently affirm your Opinion on the Place, though without advancing any the leaſt Shadow of Proof, I ſhall take Leave to enquire into the Meaning of this <hi>Text</hi>: in Order to which, it may not be amiſs to obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Scope and Deſign of the <hi>Parable of the Talents,</hi> to which this Text belongs, is evidently to ſhew, wherein our <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:006010_0023_102771D3751C67B0"/>
for Chriſt' s coming to <hi>Judgment</hi> muſt conſiſt; and what will be the main <hi>Inquiry</hi> of the <hi>great Day,</hi> upon which the final Deciſion of our everlaſting Fate will then turn, <hi>viz.</hi> whether we have done <hi>well,</hi> or <hi>ill,</hi> in the Account of the New Covenant? whether we've been <hi>good</hi> and <hi>faithful</hi> Servants of the Lord, or <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>ſlothful,</hi> in the Management of the <hi>Talents,</hi> with which we have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted?—</p>
            <p>This doubtleſs will readily be granted by every impartial atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Reader, who duly conſiders the Occaſion of this <hi>Parable,</hi> viz. The Diſcourſe, begun by our Saviour, in the preceeding Chapter, of his Second coming to <hi>Judgment,</hi> and continued down through this: followed here <hi>firſt</hi> with the Parable of <hi>the Ten Virgins,</hi> evidently referring to Chriſt's Coming to Judgment, at the End of the World, and principally deſign'd to awaken Chriſtians to the greater Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs from the Conſideration of the Uncertainty of the Time. v.13. <hi>Watch therefore, for ye know neither the Day nor the Hour, wherein the Son of Man cometh.</hi>—Next follows this Parable of the <hi>Talents,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly deſign'd (as has been obſerved) to hold forth wherein our <hi>Readineſs</hi> for Chriſt's ſecond Coming to <hi>Judgment</hi> will conſiſt, <hi>viz.</hi> in our having <hi>ſincerely improved the Advantages,</hi> with which we have been intruſted, and ſo having approv'd ourſelves <hi>good and faithful Servants,</hi>in the Account of the <hi>New Covenant.</hi> And wherein this will conſiſt, is further illuſtrated in a particular Inſtance, put for all the reſt, viz. that of honouring the Lord with our Subſtance, in Acts of <hi>Charity</hi> to the Poor, done for <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Sake: contain'd in a Deſcription of the Proceſs of the <hi>laſt Judgment,</hi> continued to the End of the Chapter.—And hence,</p>
            <p n="2">2. By the <hi>Reckoning,</hi> here mentioned as <hi>deferred for a long Time</hi> is plainly to be underſtood the <hi>final Account,</hi> which we muſt all in that Day render to God, of our reſpective Improvements. This is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evident from the Reward aſſign'd to the <hi>Faithful,</hi> and the Doom paſſed on the <hi>Unfaithful.</hi> To the one is ſaid, <hi>Enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord</hi>: but of the other,—<hi>Caſe the unprofitable Servant into outer Darkneſs, there ſhall be Weeping and Gnaſhing of Teeth.</hi> Where our Saviour inſenſibly ſlide, out of the <hi>Parable,</hi> into the <hi>Thing</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be ſignified: and thereby gives us an infallible Key to the whole; it being plain here, that theſe Expreſſions, <hi>Outer Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> where there is <hi>Weeping</hi> and <hi>Gnaſhing of Teeth,</hi> are, by a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riphrases, uſed by our Saviour to ſignify the Miſeries of the Damned in <hi>Hell.</hi>—Hence,</p>
            <p n="3">3. It follows, that by <hi>him that hath,</hi> is evidently meant one who ſhall <hi>then</hi> be found to <hi>have,</hi> in the Account of God, what the New
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:006010_0024_102771D53A5CA898"/>
Covenant requires, what in the Eye of that Covenant will denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate him a <hi>Good and Faithful Servant,</hi> or one that has <hi>done well.</hi> This is plain, in Regard 'tis with an evident Reference to the making up of that final Account in the Day of <hi>Judgment,</hi> that he is here ſaid to <hi>have.</hi>—And hence,</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is equally evident, that by the following Expreſſion, <hi>To him ſhall be given,</hi> is meant the <hi>final Reward</hi> of Glory in the future World.—</p>
            <p>Now if the <hi>Reckoning</hi> here mentioned, refers intirely to the final Account in the Day of <hi>Judgment</hi>; and if it be the Scope and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of this <hi>Parable,</hi> to point out what that is, which will then ſtand us in Stead, in that Day of <hi>Reckoning,</hi> viz. <hi>Well-doing,</hi> in the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>New-Covenant</hi>; And if by <hi>him that hath,</hi> be meant one that hath already exemplified that <hi>Well-doing,</hi> and is thereupon adjudg'd unto <hi>Glory</hi>; How is it poſſible that the <hi>ſeeking ſtriving Sinner,</hi> "not yet converted throughly from Sin to God," but "ſtill under the Dominion and Guilt of Sin," ſhould be "the Man <hi>that hath,</hi> in our Saviour's Senſe," in this Parable?—What <hi>hath</hi> ſuch a Man? <hi>Hath</hi> he that which would ſtand him in ſtead, were he <hi>now</hi> ſtanding at the Bar of God? <hi>Hath</hi> he what the <hi>New Covenant</hi> demands? <hi>Hath</hi> he what, in the Eye of that Covenant, will denominate him a <hi>good and faithful Servant,</hi> one that <hi>has done well,</hi> and ſtands intitled to eternal <hi>Glory?</hi> Can this poſſibly be true of one, who (according to your own Conceſſion) is <q>under the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and Guilt of Sin,</q> and conſequently an Unbeliever and an Impenitent in the Goſpel-Senſe, unreconciled to God, and in a State of Enmity and Rebellion againſt God, and under a righteous Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Condemnation? Nay, is not <hi>the Man that hath, to whom ſhall be given,</hi> in this <hi>Parable</hi> of the Talents, evidently repreſented by our Saviour as one who has paſs'd the awful <hi>Trial</hi> of the Great Day, and is publickly approved, and welcomed to Glory? <hi>Well done, thou good and faithful Servant,—enter into the Joy of thy Lord.</hi> And does the <hi>ſeeking, ſtriving</hi> Sinner, which you deſcribe, anſwer the Character of <hi>this</hi> Man? Hath he paſs'd his laſt Trial? Is he openly approv'd of his Lord, and welcomed to the State of the Bleſſed? How therefore you could, ſo confidently as you do, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm <hi>him</hi> to be <hi>this Man,</hi> in our <hi>Saviour's Senſe,</hi> I muſt leave.</p>
            <p>If you ſhould excuſe your Miſtake, by alledging the Judgment of ſome <hi>great and learned Men,</hi> that have conſtrued this Parable in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Opinion you here advance; I anſwer, <hi>Every Error,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in the Chriſtian World, has its Pretence of being grounded on ſome Text of <hi>Scripture.</hi> Nor is this at all to be wonder'd at: for
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:006010_0025_102771DEE7F23628"/>
when once Perſons have fallen into any erroneous Opinion, the Fruit of their own Imagination, and what appears to them reaſonable, in their own very partial View of Things, they will eaſily fancy ſuch Opinion ſupported by this or that Text of ſacred <hi>Scripture</hi>; it mat be, by a great Variety: And ſometimes (becauſe it is impoſſible, in that Caſe, to fix upon any Text, that is full and clear to their Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) they pretend, that the <hi>Current of the whole Scripture</hi> runs that Way, from the Beginning of <hi>Geneſis</hi> to the End of <hi>Revelation.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, certainly this is not to come to the Scriptures as a pure Fountain, to derive our Opinions from thence; but to bring our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions with us to the Scripture, and by the Help of a ſtrong Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to mould the Bible by them. Now,</p>
            <p>This I take to be evidently the Caſe of thoſe who urge a Promiſe to the <hi>Unregenerate,</hi> from this <hi>Parable.</hi> They firſt, it ſeems, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from their own View of Things, that ſuch a <hi>Promiſe</hi> to the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is highly <hi>reaſonable,</hi> as may ſecure it in <hi>his own Power</hi> (at leaſt <hi>morally</hi>) to be everlaſtingly <hi>happy</hi>: Which Concluſion being ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed partly on a <hi>favourable</hi> Thought of the State of the fallen Creature, eſpecially on the State of an <hi>awakened reforming</hi> Sinner, as deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above, they ſeem to conceive ſome <hi>Fitneſs</hi> in ſuch a State of the Sinner, <hi>qualifying him for Help from God,</hi> and conſtituting him a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Subject of <hi>gracious Promiſes.</hi> This ſeems to be intimated in your Notion of there being a certain "<hi>Medium</hi> between an <hi>obsſtinate relentleſs Sinner,</hi> and one that is <hi>throughly regenerate,</hi> or intirely devoted to God," and ſeems to be the Ground of your inſiſting that the Sinner be brought to "<hi>ſtrive in earneſt,</hi> that he may be <hi>quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for God's Help.</hi>"—And now being fix'd in this Opinion, that there is a <hi>Meetneſs</hi> in this State of a Sinner to receive <hi>Help</hi> (i. e. <hi>efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Aid,</hi> or ſpecial Grace) <hi>from God,</hi> theſe Gentlemen bringing this Opinion with them to the ſacred Text, they read here that <hi>To every one that hath, ſhall be given,</hi> and thence conclude a <hi>Promiſe</hi> from God made to the <hi>ſtriving Sinner,</hi> though not yet thorowly devoted to God in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But, good Sir, by whoſe Authority do they make this Concluſion? Does; it ſlow from divine Promiſes? Chriſt indeed in the <hi>Parable</hi> hath ſaid, <hi>Unto him that hath, ſhall be given</hi>: But hath he any where: ſaid, that the <hi>ſtriving</hi> (but unconverted) <hi>Sinner</hi> is this Man <hi>that hath</hi>? Or, Is there in all this <hi>Parable</hi> one Word, or Syllable, about the <hi>ſtriving Sinner,</hi> or of the Beſtowment of <hi>converting Grace</hi>? Surely, nothing like it. No, This is the preconceived <hi>human Opinion</hi> (I ſpake of) which every one brings with him to the <hi>divine Text,</hi> who infers a <hi>Promiſe</hi> to Sinners from this <hi>Parable.</hi> And it is impoſſible
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:006010_0026_102771E1DBCAF998"/>
to argue any Thing, for their Opinion, concluſively from the <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> it ſelf.</p>
            <p>You go on to ſay, "<hi>And I am under an invincible Neceſſity of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding</hi> MATTH. 7. 7. and 11. 28. LUKE 11. 13, &amp;c. <hi>as belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſuch as be.</hi>" Theſe Promiſes, you hold, do belong to the <hi>Unregenerate,</hi> though under the Dominion and Guilt of Sin, yet <hi>ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>ſtriving,</hi> as aforeſaid. But how do you prove this? Why firſt by the <hi>Neceſſity you find your ſelf under</hi> thus <hi>to underſtand them</hi>: You plead, that you are <hi>neceſſitated</hi> ſo to underſtand them, and that you <hi>cannot for your Life help</hi> thus interpreting them, &amp;c. As if you meant to carry the Argument intirely by Dint of this Plea from a felt <hi>Neceſſity</hi> upon you.—But ſince it is allowed, on all Hands, that wrong Conceptions through Prejudice, or Want of a clear Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Caſe, may be the Ground of ſuch an apprehended <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> as well as the Evidence of Truth, you will doubtleſs allow this Conſideration to be abſolutely ſet aſide in the preſent Debate, as containing nothing concluſive or argumentative in the Caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.</p>
            <p>You proceed, and ſay,—"<hi>Can any one be ſo abſurd as to interpret theſe Promiſes thus? You that have already received the ſpecial Grace of God,</hi> Ask, and ye ſhall receive:— <hi>You that have already found Mercy,</hi> Seek, and ye ſhall find:—<hi>You to whom the Gate of Mercy is already opened and are already got within it,</hi> Knock, and it ſhall be opened:— <hi>You who have already get Reſt,</hi> Come to me, and I will give you Reſt, <hi>&amp;c.— Is not this</hi> (ſay you) <hi>making perfect</hi> Nonſenſe <hi>of the precious Promiſes of God! To me it ſeems nothing can be more ſo. And yet this muſt be your own interpretation</hi> (ſay you to the Rev. <hi>Author</hi>) <hi>if you deny their being made, even to the Unregenerate</hi>:" i. e. to ſuch of them as have been deſcribed.</p>
            <p>The Argument uſed here is what is called <hi>Reductio ad Abſurdum</hi>: And its whole Force lies in this That theſe <hi>Promiſes</hi> cannot be <hi>other-wiſe</hi> interpreted, than as belonging to the <hi>Unregenerate,</hi> while ſuch, but by reſolving their Meaning into <hi>perfect Nonſenſe.</hi> Now, if this can be proved, I own, the Argument muſt be yielded: For, to be ſure, we muſt not <hi>make perfect Nonſenſe of</hi> the holy Scriptures.— But where is the Proof? You, Sir, indeed have ſaid it; and that's all:—To refute this your Notion of the <hi>Abſurdity</hi> of underſtanding theſe <hi>Promiſes</hi> otherwiſe, than as belonging to the <hi>Unregenerate,</hi> whilſt ſuch, it may ſuffice to obſerve, that it is intirely grounded on one or other, or all of the following <hi>falſe Hypotheſes</hi>: viz.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That theſe conditional Promiſes were not ſpoken, or meant to <hi>Believers,</hi> but to others <hi>excluſive</hi> of them.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:006010_0027_102771E3A138D260"/>2. That the <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Petition</hi> and <hi>Inquiry</hi> here, or what is here enjoined to be <hi>asked</hi> and <hi>ſought,</hi> is limited to the firſt Grace of ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Converſion,</hi> and extends not to After-Grace, in <hi>progreſſive</hi> Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the <hi>asking, ſeeking, knocking,</hi> and <hi>coming</hi> to Chriſt, unto which the <hi>Promiſe</hi> is here annexed, are to be conceived as Doings that are <hi>ſhort</hi> of that <hi>Faith,</hi> which implies a thorow Converſion to God in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Theſe, I think, muſt be the Suppoſitions, on which your Notion of the <hi>Abſurdity</hi> of our Interpretation is intirely grounded; Which being fairly examined, and removed by the Force of Truth, theſe <hi>Promiſes</hi> may be interpreted as we underſtand them, without any the leaſt Shadow of <hi>Abſurdity,</hi> and be ſure, without any Danger of their being made <hi>perfect Nonſenſe.</hi> And now,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>theſe Things are here ſuppoſed,</hi> and made the intire Ground of that <hi>Abſurdity,</hi> pretended to be in underſtanding thoſe <hi>Promiſes</hi> otherwiſe than as belonging to the <hi>Unregenerate,</hi> whilſt ſuch, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from this Conſideration, That the <hi>removing</hi> of theſe <hi>Suppoſitions</hi> is the removing of all Appearances of <hi>Abſurdity,</hi> and leaves not any the leaſt Shadow of it in the Caſe. For if theſe Promiſes are ſpoken and meant to <hi>Believers,</hi> and the Matter of the <hi>Petition</hi> here enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is not limited to the firſt Grace of Converſion, <hi>excluſive</hi> of After-Grace in Order to progreſſive Sanctification, where is the <hi>Abſurdity</hi> you ſpeak of, even according to your own Reading of the Text? "<hi>You that have already received the ſpecial Grace of God,</hi> that are true Believers, Heirs of the Promiſes, that have Grace and Glory and very good Thing laid up in them, <hi>Ask; and ye ſhall receive</hi>;— you <hi>who have already found Mercy, Seek and ye ſhall find,</hi> i. e. further Mercy, or <hi>more Grace.</hi> Is it <hi>abſurd,</hi> that he which hath <hi>Life,</hi> ſhould <hi>have it more abundantly</hi>? Is it at all <hi>abſurd,</hi> that the Believer, who has received the <hi>firſt</hi> Grace, ſhould he enjoined to <hi>ask, ſeek,</hi> and <hi>knock</hi> at the Door of Mercy, for further Supplies? Or, is it <hi>abſurd,</hi> that he ſhould be promiſed <hi>Succeſs</hi> in ſo doing? So, if the <hi>Asking,</hi> to which the Promiſe is here annexed, be asking in <hi>Faith,</hi> where is the <hi>Abſurdity</hi> of underſtanding theſe Promiſes <hi>otherwiſe</hi> than as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the <hi>Unregenerate,</hi> continuing ſuch? Nay, how is it poſſible that they ſhould belong to them at all, while continuing in their <hi>Unbelief</hi> and not <hi>through Chriſt having Acceſs by the Spirit unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>?— Thus it is fully evident, here, that the whole Pretence of <hi>Abſurdity,</hi> in underſtanding theſe Promiſes otherwiſe than as belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Unregenerate,</hi> depends intirely on the Truth of this, and the other Suppoſitions; Which if found <hi>not true</hi> the Objection you
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:006010_0028_102771E612290470"/>
make, vaniſhes intirely. So that what remains for me to do here, is,</p>
            <p n="2">2. To evince the utter <hi>Falſeneſs</hi> of each of theſe <hi>Suppoſitions.</hi>— And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Suppoſition, that theſe Promiſes were not ſpoken and meant to <hi>Believers,</hi> but to others <hi>excluſive</hi> of them, is evidently a <hi>Miſtake.</hi> For it is certain, that Chriſt's <hi>Diſciples</hi> were preſent at the preaching of this Sermon on the Mount, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 1. And likewiſe that what is ſaid by our Saviour in <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 13. was ſaid directly to his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> on their Requeſt that he <hi>would teach them to pray,</hi> v. 1. Certain it is therefore, that theſe Promiſes were ſpoken and meant to <hi>Believers,</hi> and not to others <hi>excluſive</hi> of them; unleſs it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed here, that Chriſts <hi>Diſciples</hi> were not Believers; what no one, I preſume, will pretend. Nay, which is more, to make good this Suppoſition, it muſt be proved, that there was not one of the whole Company preſent a <hi>Believer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Suppoſition, that the <hi>Matter</hi> of the <hi>Petition</hi> and Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry here, or what is here enjoined to be <hi>asked</hi> and <hi>ſought,</hi> is limited to the firſt Grace of <hi>Converſion,</hi> excluſive of conſequent Grace in <hi>progreſſive</hi> Sanctification, is alſo evidently <hi>falſe.</hi> For ſince theſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were enjoined upon the <hi>Diſciples</hi> themſelves, with Promiſes of Succeſs, and not on others <hi>excluſive</hi> of them, it muſt therefore be impoſſible, that the Matter of <hi>Petition</hi> and <hi>Inquiry</hi> enjoined them ſhould be limited to the <hi>firſt</hi> Grace, becauſe this they had <hi>already</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; and therefore to enjoin them to ask and ſeek <hi>that,</hi> would be an Inconſiſtency and Abſurdity indeed.—The Suppoſition,</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the <hi>asking, ſeeking,</hi> &amp;c. to which Succeſs is here <hi>promiſed,</hi> are Doings ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ort of that <hi>Faith,</hi> which implies an intire Devotedneſs to God in Chriſt, is alſo evidently <hi>falſe.</hi> For, if the <hi>asking</hi> and <hi>ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> &amp;c. to which the <hi>Promiſe</hi> here is annex'd, be any Doings <hi>ſhort of unfeigned Faith,</hi> then we are to underſtand our Saviour here to <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join</hi> theſe Duties without regarding their neceſſary Principle, which is <hi>Faith.</hi> The Injunction ought in Reaſon to be interpreted in the ſame Latitude as the Promiſe that is annexed. And can it once be imagined, that our bleſſed Saviour would enjoin his Diſciples to <hi>ask, ſeek,</hi> and <hi>knock</hi> by Prayer, without <hi>Faith unfeigned</hi>? Would not this be to teach them to approach unto God otherwiſe than through a <hi>Mediator</hi>; contrary to the grand Deſign of the <hi>Goſpel</hi>? Which is ſtiled Rom. 16. 26. <hi>The Revelation of the Myſtery made known to all Nations for the Obedience of Faith.</hi> Would it not to be to enjoin what could by no Means be pleaſing or acceptable to God? Since (Heb. 11. 6.) <hi>Without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> Do not the Scriptures
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:006010_0029_102771EDA612AC70"/>
enjoin us (Col. 3. 17) <hi>to do all In the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi>? And can this be done without <hi>Faith</hi>? Yea, do not the Scriptures require the Exerciſe of <hi>Faith,</hi> in every Inſtance, to accompany Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? Seeing they declare it the Will of God (1 Tim. 2. 8.) <hi>That Men pray every where, lifting up holy Hands, without Wrath and Doubting.</hi> And can Prayer be performed with <hi>holy Hands lifted up,</hi> where that <hi>Faith</hi> is wanting, which <hi>purifieth the Heart</hi> and Hands? But certainly, it cannot be done <hi>without Doubting.</hi> Does not the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly caution all againſt this Miſtake, of placing Dependance on the Succeſs of Prayer deſtitute of <hi>Faith</hi>? Jam. 1. 5, 6, 7. <hi>If any Man lack Wiſdom, let him ask of Gods, that giveth to all Men liberally, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bradeth not; and it ſhall be given him. But let him ask in Faith, nothing wavering: for he that wavereth, is like a Wave of the Sea, driven with Wind, and toſſed. For let not that Man think that he ſhall receive any Thing of the Lord.</hi> q. d. Taking into Conſideration the Extent of the New-Covenant, the whole Deſign of God's Mercy to fallen Mankind through a <hi>Mediator,</hi> and the unbounded Goodneſs of God's Nature, whereby, in this New-Covenant-Way, he deals out to all Men moſt liberally, without upbraiding any; yet nevertheleſs, upon the largeſt View of theſe Things, let no Man fall into this Miſtake, that a <hi>faithleſs Prayer</hi> will take hold of God, or obtain any Mercy at all, at his Hand.—From all which, and much more that might be offered, were it needful, it is inconteſtibly evident, that the laſt of theſe Suppoſitions, as well as the two former, is intirely a Miſtake.</p>
            <p>Nor is it leſs evident, that the <hi>Coming to Chriſt,</hi> to which a Promiſe of Reſt ſtands annexed (<hi>Matth.</hi> 11 28.) is plainly meant of comings by <hi>Faith</hi>; and it were eaſy to ſhew, it is generally ſo; underſtood by Divines, of every Denomination. But if an Appeal be had here from the Authority of Men to the Authority of God, and according to that moſt excellent Rule of interpreting Scripture by Scripture, you are diſpoſed to reſt ſatisfied in a Deciſion of this Matter, by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, we then have it in <hi>John</hi> 6. 35. <hi>I am the Bread of Life: be that cometh to me, ſhall never hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and be that believeth on me, ſhall never thirſt.</hi> Where it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding obvious, that <hi>coming to Chriſt, as the Bread of Life,</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on him,</hi> are uſed as Terms of the ſame Import, and equal Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificancy: the ſame ſpiritual and everlaſtingly ſatisfying Bleſſings being <hi>promiſed</hi> to each.</p>
            <p>Now, upon the whole, If it be certain, that the <hi>Intire Reaſon</hi> you have aſſign'd, why theſe Promiſes ſhould be underſtood, as belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Unregenerate,</hi> whilſt ſuch, is the <hi>Abſurdity</hi> of underſtanding them <hi>otherwiſe</hi>; which indeed you ſay cannot be done without
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:006010_0030_102771F0A10166E0"/>
making <hi>perfect Nonſenſe</hi> of them;—and if it be alſo certain, that this Notion of the <hi>Abſurdity</hi> of underſtanding them otherwiſe, be grounded wholly on certain <hi>Suppoſitions</hi>; Which Suppoſitions, no leſs certainly are meer <hi>Miſtakes,</hi> and utterly ungrounded: Then it muſt, I think, undeniably follow, that the whole <hi>Reaſon</hi> you have aſſign'd why theſe Promiſes ſhould be underſtood as belonging to the Unregenerate, whilſt ſuch, is intirely <hi>removed</hi> and <hi>vacated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus reſcued theſe <hi>Texts</hi> from that unnatural Force put upon them, by means of <hi>falſe</hi> Suppoſitions, and reſtored their <hi>true</hi> and <hi>genuine</hi> Meaning; all that are honeſtly minded, and have no <hi>preconceiv'd Scheme</hi> of their own to ſerve by <hi>wreſting the Scriptures,</hi> will (I doubt not) be able to read theſe <hi>Promiſes</hi> as made immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to the <hi>Children of God,</hi> to excite them to be much and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt in the great Duty of <hi>Prayer,</hi> from the Conſideration of the Certainty of <hi>Succeſs</hi> to attend the <hi>Prayer of Faith; the effectual ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Prayer of a righteous Man availing much.</hi> Though they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provable alſo as an Excitement and Encouragement to all <hi>others,</hi> to be concern'd that they may be brought likewiſe to <hi>ask, ſeek, knock,</hi> and <hi>come</hi> by <hi>Faith</hi> to the Mercy of God through the <hi>Mediator,</hi> as the only certain Means of Succeſs. taught us in the Scriptures of Truth, by Divine <hi>Promiſes</hi> made thereto.</p>
            <p>Having, as you ſuppoſed, eſtabliſhed the Senſe of theſe Texts in your own Favour; you, in the next Place, thus proceed. "<hi>For God's ſake, Dear Sir, let us take Care that we do not, from a violent Attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to any preconceived humane Schemes, pervert the plaineſt and moſt obvious Declarations, and Promiſes of the Goſpel. To me it is manifeſt, that this is what thoſe on your Side really do; and that your whole Syſtem, where it is peculiar, is not founded on the holy Scriptures (taken in the whole, and critically read and conſidered) but on the empty Cob-webs of</hi> Scholaſtical Metaphyſics (vain Philoſophy, Science falſly ſo called): <hi>together with ſome few obſcure</hi> Texts, <hi>not rightly underſtood, for want of a critical Skill in the ancient Languages, and the Notions and Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies of thoſe Times, and for want of an exact Attention to the Scope and Argument of the ſacred Writers; In Conſequence of which you ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly torture the plaineſt Texts, to make them ſpeak your Senſe, and ſo</hi> corrupt the Plainneſs and Simplicity of the Goſpel, <hi>and in Effect make it a meer unintelligible Riddle.</hi>"</p>
            <p>Here, Sir, being ſtruck with the utmoſt Surprize, I muſt beg leave to <hi>pauſe</hi> a while, as not able ſuddenly to reſolve what is beſt to ſay! — Is <hi>this</hi> the <hi>Charity</hi>!—<hi>This</hi> the following after <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Holineſs</hi>! — which you ſeem ſo earneſtly to pray for, in your next Page.—Is <hi>this</hi> the melting of your <hi>Bowels,</hi> for them, over whom
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:006010_0031_102771F8070B7780"/>
(<hi>Pag.</hi> 22.) you profeſs to <hi>grieve,</hi> and for whom (<hi>Pag.</hi> I) you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs your <hi>Charity,</hi> as <hi>Serious Chriſtians,</hi> that are not at all ſenſible of their Miſtake! Was it poſſible Sir, that you ſhould conceive any the leaſt Tendency, in theſe aſtoniſhing Lines of yours, to win upon their Affections, or to ſet before them any Matter of Conviction;— unleſs it were of the preſent Temper of their <hi>quondam</hi> Friend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them?</p>
            <p>Could you once imagine, Sir, that the Loudneſs of your Cry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt others, as being <hi>violently attached to human Schemes, perverting the plaineſt Texts, building en empty Cobwebs</hi> &amp;c. would ſecure you from the ſame Imputations; or prevent your being; in the Sequel, found in the Number of thoſe, againſt whom you make ſuch a hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous Outery? The dark Character, you have here drawn, may perhaps in the Subſtance of it really agree to one or other of theſe contending Parties: But then what Right have <hi>you,</hi> 'good Sir, to fit <hi>Judge,</hi> in your own Cauſe? Which, to make ſure Work, you have done: and no wonder at all; that you have carried the Caſe in your own Favour.—However, the Right of Appeal is challenged; and the Matter chearfully ſubmitted to the Judgment of impartial Readers, whether you have gained your Point, or not; <hi>i. e.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Scriptures you have alledged, with your Reaſons enforcing them, compared with what has now been replied, do clearly and fully prove the <hi>Affirmative</hi> Part of the Queſtion before us; I ſay, <hi>clearly</hi> and <hi>fully,</hi>—for ſuch ought to be the Proof in this <hi>important</hi> Caſe; ſince the Opinion you've advanced, affects the very Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>New-Covenant,</hi> and adds to it an <hi>eſſential Branch,</hi> that we know nothing of.</p>
            <p>The Covenant of Grace we acknowledge; the Tenor whereof is plainly this, <hi>He that believeth on the Son of God hath everlaſting Life, and ſhall never periſh.</hi> According to this, God is a Covenant-God and Father to <hi>Believers.</hi> But a <hi>Covenant-Obligation,</hi> whereby God is bound to give his <hi>ſpecial efficacious Grace,</hi> and ſo his <hi>Spirit,</hi> and his <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to the <hi>Unregenerate,</hi> by Virtue of his own <hi>Promiſe,</hi> made to any <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Seekings, Strivings</hi> of theirs, ſhort of that <hi>Faith,</hi> by which the <hi>Juſt do live,</hi> is what <hi>we</hi> don't know any Thing of, neither do the <hi>Scriptures of Truth,</hi> nor indeed any publick <hi>Confeſſion of Faith</hi> in the Proteſtant World, that we are acquainted with, nor even the <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> and Homilies of your own Church of <hi>England.</hi> And therefore until this Point, which you ſo contend for, be ſettled, by clear and full Evidence from <hi>Divine Teſtimony,</hi> we muſt not, we dare not, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of it, left we be found guilty of <hi>adding to the Word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what is moſt of all ſurprizing here, is, that you ſhould not only
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:006010_0032_102771FB464A7940"/>
ſo peremptorily decide the Caſe in your own Favour, but that you ſhould in ſo confident a Manner accuſe and condemn all on the other Side, as "<hi>perverting the plaineſt Declarations of the Goſpel,—founding their whole Syſtem, ſo far as it is peculiar</hi> (which at leaſt muſt in your Senſe, take in this of denying <hi>Promiſes</hi> of ſpecial Grace to any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the <hi>Unregenerate</hi>) <hi>on the empty Cobwebs of ſcholaſtical Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſicks, vain Philoſophy, Science falſly ſo called,—Scripture are rightly underſtood, for Want of critical Skill in the antient Languages, and exact Attention to the Scope and Argument of the ſacred Writers; in Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which</hi> (ſay you to die Rev. <hi>Author</hi> and thoſe of his Mind) <hi>you manifeſtly torture the plaineſt Texts to make them ſpeak your Senſe, and corrupt the Simplicity of the Goſpel, and make it in Effects a meer unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible Riddle.</hi>"</p>
            <p>Now, Sir, I pray tell me, was this truly the Caſe with all thoſe famous <hi>Biſhops, Doctors,</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who have given their Suffrages full in Favour of the <hi>Negative</hi> Side of the Queſtion? Or was this indeed the Caſe with the whole Body of the Clergy of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> from the firſt Dawn of the Reformation? And was this the Caſe with all thoſe other eminent Divines at home and abroad, living and dead, that might be mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as favouring the <hi>Negative</hi> in the preſent Queſtion? In ſober Earneſt, tell me, Sir, Do all theſe <hi>pervert the moſt obvious Promiſes of the Goſpel, from a violent Attachment to human Schemes</hi>? Do all theſe godly, learned Men <hi>torture the plaineſt Texts, to make them ſpeak their Senſe</hi>? Do they all, in this Point at leaſt, <hi>build upon the empty Cobwebs of Scholaſtick Metaphyſicks, and vain Philoſophy</hi>? Have none of them ever been Maſters of a ſufficiect <hi>critical Skill in the ancient Languages</hi>? &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I might here confront vour Opinion with the contrary Judgment of many of the greateſt Writers in your own Church: from whom I might eaſily collect enough to fill up a conſiderable Volume, But I ſhall at preſent give you only a Quotation from that renowned <hi>Prelate,</hi> pious and learned Biſhop <hi>Hopkins,</hi> on the <hi>Covenant</hi> (P. 152) where having ſaid ſeveral Things on this Head, he ſums up the Matter thus. <q>In brief, the <hi>abſolute</hi> Covenant promiſeth the firſt Grace of Converſion to God; the <hi>Conditional</hi> promiſeth <hi>Life, if</hi> we be <hi>converted.</hi> The <hi>Conditional</hi> promiſeth <hi>Life, if</hi> we <hi>believe</hi>: The <hi>Abſolute</hi> promiſeth <hi>Faith,</hi> whereby we may believe to the ſaving of our Souls; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is called an <hi>abſolute</hi> Covenant, becauſe the <hi>firſt Grace</hi> of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to God <hi>cannot</hi> be given upon <hi>Conditions.</hi>—It is indeed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly wrought in Men by the right Uſe of <hi>Means,</hi> as hearing the Word, Meditation, Prayer, &amp;c but theſe Means are not <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="unknown:006010_0033_102771FE64B0E220"/>
                  <hi>of Grace,</hi> becauſe we have found that in ſome Inſtanecs God hath not limited himſelf to them.—And indeed, what is there that can in Reaſon be ſuppoſed a <hi>Condition</hi> of God's beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gift of the <hi>firſt Grace</hi> upon us? Either it muſt be ſome Act of <hi>Grace,</hi> or of meer <hi>Nature.</hi> Not of <hi>Grace,</hi> for then the <hi>firſt</hi> Grace would be <hi>already</hi> given: Not of <hi>Nature,</hi> for then <hi>Grace</hi> would be given according to <hi>Works,</hi> which is the <hi>Sum</hi> and <hi>Upſhot</hi> of PELAGIANISM.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, Sir, for my own Part, though I am far from concluding, that <hi>every one,</hi> who is in this Error, is a <hi>Pelagian</hi>: Becauſe this may be the Caſe with ſome, who have, ere they were aware, been induced, by what they have head plauſibly ſaid on this Point, to entertain a favourable Thought of it: Yet I am fully perſuaded, that this learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed BISHOP <hi>throughly underſtood what be here ſays,</hi> and that when ever <hi>Truth</hi> in this Point is ſearched to the Bottom, the <hi>Affirmative</hi> Part of ike Queſtion will be found the pernicious Fruit of Error, growing on the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Root of denying the Doctrine of <hi>Original Sin,</hi> as held forth in our publick <hi>Confeſſions</hi> of Faith, and in the <hi>Articles</hi> and <hi>Homilies</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi>:—And that, reſerving Credit to the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of <hi>Original Sin,</hi> it will be found a much harder Task to <hi>recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile</hi> with the <hi>Divine Attributes</hi> this unaccountable Notion of a <hi>Grant</hi> in the Goſpel, of <hi>New Covenant-Bleſſings,</hi> on Condition of <hi>Old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Works,</hi> i. e. certain Doings of the <hi>Unregenerate,</hi> whilſt ſuch, than to reconcile with the Divine Attributes, the Notion of God's permiting fallen Mankind to come into the World in ſuch a corrupt and ſinful State, as not to have it ſecured in all Reſpects in their <hi>Power</hi> (as well <hi>Morally,</hi> i. e. notwithſtanding any inherent Viciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Depravity, as <hi>naturally</hi>) to be everlaſtingly <hi>happy.</hi> And here, Sir, by the Way, ſince you have been ready to impute it to <hi>Prejudice,</hi> when any among your <hi>Diſſenting Brethren</hi>(as you call them) have doubted of <hi>your Orthodoxy</hi> in the grand Point of <hi>Original Sin,</hi> I would obſerve that you have now (on what is recited above) an advantage of conſidering the Matter more free from <hi>Prejudice</hi>; ſince it is not the doubtful Tho't, but firm perſuaſion of one of your own <hi>Biſhops,</hi> that the <hi>Error,</hi> which <hi>you</hi> plead for is the very <hi>Sum</hi> and <hi>Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot</hi> of <hi>Pelagianiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What now remains of your Letter, is chiefly a repeating and urging of that <hi>invincible Neceſſity,</hi> which you ſay you are under, of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe Promiſes as belonging to the <hi>unregenerate,</hi> i. e. whilſt ſuch.

Creature is all this while <hi>going about to eſtabliſh a Righteouſneſs of his own,</hi> for the general Kind the ſame with That, required in the <hi>firſt</hi> Covenant.</q>—The <hi>Author</hi> argues againſt that miſtaken Perſwaſion,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it leaves Room for <hi>Boaſting</hi>: And this, he juſtly obſerves, "is quite inconſiſtent with and contrary to the whole Tenor and main Deſign of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which is perfectly to exclude all Boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in and of <hi>our ſelves,</hi> and to lay the Crown of our Salvation on the Head of rich, free, and ſovereign <hi>Grace</hi> through Chriſt Jeſus."</p>
            <p>Omitting at preſent the three other ſubſervient Conſiderations, mentioned by the <hi>Author</hi> in his Sermon, I ſhall confine my Thoughts to the two above-recited: And conſidering theſe in one complex View, as they are of ſuch near Affinity, and ſo cloſely connected, I ſhall vindicate them both together, for Brevity's Sake.</p>
            <p>Now, to open the Way to this Defence, allow me to make a few preliminary Obſervations. And I ſay in general, If it can be made evident, that to hold certain <hi>Seekings, Strivings,</hi> or <hi>Doings</hi> whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of the <hi>Unregenerate,</hi> whilſt ſuch, <hi>conditional</hi> of the Beſtowment of <hi>ſpecial converting Grace,</hi> or that to which the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of ſuch Grace is made, be to countenance the fallen Creature's <hi>going about to eſtabliſh his own Righteouſneſs,</hi> and to allow of that Boaſting, to which the Goſpel every where expreſly denies any Place in the Affair of <hi>bringing us unto God</hi>; it will then doubtleſs be acknowledged, upon ſuch Evidence, that the <hi>Arguments</hi> above are ſolid and concluſive.— And the Truth of the foregoing Propoſition, may, I think, be evinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the following Conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That to ſuppoſe <hi>ſpecial converting Grace</hi> enſured or ſecured to the <hi>Unregenerate,</hi> by a <hi>Promiſe</hi> thereof made to any <hi>Doings</hi> of theirs, whilſt under the Dominion and Guilt of Sin, and eſtabliſhing a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection</hi> between ſuch <hi>his Grace,</hi> and ſuch <hi>their Doings,</hi> is to ſuppoſe God's acting properly as a <hi>moral Governor</hi> in this Affair, and making the Sinner's <hi>Works</hi> the Rule of his Diſpenſations, even in point of <hi>Regenerating</hi> Grace, or effectual Calling.—And again,</p>
            <p n="2">2. This ſuppoſes ſome acceptable Degree of <hi>moral Goodneſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick Worth,</hi> or <hi>true Excellency,</hi> in theſe <hi>Doings</hi> of the Unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; ſomething in them of vital and true <hi>Holineſs,</hi> in God's Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: and implies that his Method of <hi>ſaving us</hi> is <hi>by Works of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which we have done,</hi> and not meerly <hi>according to his Mercy,</hi> or ſovereign Grace.—Becauſe if there were not ſome acceptable Meaſure of <hi>moral Rectitude</hi> and <hi>true Goodneſs,</hi> or nothing that is truly <hi>vital, ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> in ſuch their <hi>Doings,</hi> it ſeems not reconcila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the <hi>moral Perfections</hi> of God, and therefore impoſſible in
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:006010_0038_10277213CDAEF9B8"/>
the Nature of Things, that he ſhould eſtabliſh a <hi>Rule,</hi> reſpecting theſe <hi>Doings</hi> of theirs as the <hi>Condition</hi> of his Promiſe, according to which, as a moral Governor, he conducts himſelf in the Diſpenſation of his <hi>firſt</hi> ſpecial Grace to Sinners.—And now,</p>
            <p n="3">3. To aſſert, that there is any the leaſt true <hi>Vitality, Spirituality,</hi> or <hi>moral Rectitude</hi> before God, in the beſt <hi>Doings</hi> of the <hi>Unregenerate,</hi> even of Sinners in your <hi>middle</hi> Condition, i. e. "Such as are really ſolicitous for Salvation, but not yet throughly converted from Sin to God," and accordingly to conſide in and plead any ſuch Doings as <hi>intitling</hi> (though by virtue of the Promiſes only) to <hi>ſpecial Grace,</hi>—this it ſelf is that very <hi>Boaſting,</hi> which by the whole Tenor of the Chriſtian Revelation is <hi>excluded</hi> out of the Buſineſs of our <hi>ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be juſtify'd by Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>coming to God by him</hi> for Salvation.— And hence it inevitably follows,</p>
            <p n="4">4. That to teach for Doctrine, that any the beſt <hi>Endeavours</hi> and higheſt <hi>Improvements</hi> of Sinners <hi>Unregenerate,</hi> or in your Senſe of the Word, ſuch as are "<hi>not yet intirely devoted to God</hi>" are the reveal'd federal <hi>Condition</hi> of promiſed converting <hi>Grace,</hi> is in true Conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion nothing leſs than to <hi>introduce</hi> into the Scheme of Salvation that very <hi>Boaſting,</hi> which the Goſpel moſt expreſly <hi>ſhuts out,</hi> and to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troniſe that <hi>going about to eſtabliſh our own Righteouſneſs,</hi> which is inconſiſtent with a due <hi>Submiſſion to the Righteouſneſs that is of God by Faith.</hi>—This Concluſion will neceſſarily ariſe out of the Premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; which, as I apprehend, admit of the eaſieſt and moſt copious Proofs, from Revelation and Reaſon.</p>
            <p>As to the Thing ſuppoſed in the <hi>firſt</hi> Propoſition, it appears to me one; of the leading Principles in the <hi>Arminian</hi> Scheme, and is agreable (Sir) to your profeſs'd Opinion, That God diſpenſes his <hi>ſpecial Grace,</hi> or in your Senſe of the Words, his <hi>efficacious Aid,</hi> not as an abſolute Proprietor and ſovereign Benefactor, but as a <hi>moral Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor,</hi> and <hi>righteous Judge</hi> of the Behaviour and Improvements of his Creatures.</p>
            <p>And as to the <hi>ſecond</hi> Propoſition, this is ſtrictly demonſtrable from the firſt; ſince to ſuppoſe the Behaviour and Improvements of the Creature to be the <hi>Rule,</hi> which God reſpects, as a <hi>moral Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> and <hi>righteous Judge,</hi> in the Diſpenſation of his ſpecial efficacious Grace, and yet at the ſame time to ſuppoſe the ſaid Behaviour and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements quite <hi>devoid</hi> of all true moral <hi>Goodneſs</hi> or vital <hi>Holineſs</hi> in the ſight of God, would be nothing leſs than to make two <hi>incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible</hi> Suppoſitions, and to run yourſelf into a flat <hi>Contradiction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that the only Article in the Premiſes, that demands Proof, in
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:006010_0039_10277215926B1298"/>
Order to bring out the Concluſion, and eſtabliſh the Argument in hand, is the <hi>third,</hi>—as above. And this again is too evident, to need any elaborate Confirmation of it. For the Sinner's conceiving ſo highly of his own <hi>Doings,</hi> or any poſſible <hi>Strivings, Seekings,</hi> or <hi>Comings to Chriſt,</hi> which he is capable of in his <hi>unregenerate</hi> Condition, and while (according to you) <hi>not yet thoroughly converted,</hi> as to imagine ſome true <hi>Virtue,</hi> ſome proper <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> or moral <hi>Rectitude</hi> in ſuch his Performances and Endeavours, and accordingly to imagine a <hi>Right</hi> to the Bleſſing of <hi>ſpecial Grace,</hi> or Divine efficacious Aid, <hi>paſs'd over to him</hi> by Means of theſe his Doings and Attempt though only as Compliances with the Divine conditional <hi>Promiſe,</hi> in which God is ſuppoſed to have made a ſure <hi>connetion</hi> between renewing Grace and ſuch Endeavours; <hi>This,</hi> if I know any thing of Goſpel-Humility, is not <hi>to think ſoberly,</hi> but <hi>to think of himſelf more highly than he ought to think,</hi> as the Caſe appears to me. Here is ſpiritual <hi>Pride,</hi> founded on vain Imaginations. Here are Falſehoods ſet up for Truths, and improv'd to <hi>Self-Righteouſneſs,</hi> and to ſuch <hi>Self-Boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as hath much of moral Evil in it. And methinks, none ſhould doubt whether the Goſpel-Scheme of Salvation excludes <hi>this,</hi> when it is ſo expreſly declared that <hi>Boaſting</hi> (all ſinful Boaſting) <hi>is excluded by the Law of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The only Point here, requiring Proof, I think is this, That the <hi>Suppoſition</hi> of any true <hi>moral Excellency</hi> and <hi>ſolid Goodneſs</hi> in the beſt poſſible Doings of the <hi>Unregenerate,</hi> whilſt ſuch, is but a meer <hi>Dream</hi> and <hi>vain Imagination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though this appears to me inconteſtibly evident, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

It's impoſſible then, that the <hi>Suppoſition</hi> before us ſhould have any Foundation in <hi>Truth.</hi>—And I argue upon this; If he beſt Doings of the Unregenerate have no proper moral Goodneſs in them, they then have no moral <hi>Fitneſs</hi> to be the <hi>Condition</hi> in a Divine <hi>Promiſe</hi>

of ſpecial Grace; and conſequently to plead ſuch a morally unfit Condition though perform'd to the higheſt Degree that an unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate State will admit of, as intitling the Doer (in Virtue of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Promiſe) to ſaving Grace, is to <hi>rejoice in a Thing of Nought,</hi> and to <hi>bring in</hi> that vain <hi>Boaſting,</hi> which the Goſpel-Scheme intirely <hi>ſhuts out.</hi> To ſuppoſe therefore any <hi>Works</hi> of the Unregenerate, in God's Promiſe, cloathed with ſuch a <hi>Conditionality,</hi> as hath this <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Boaſting</hi> inſeparably connected with it, is nothing leſs than to <hi>pervert the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> and thwart its true Deſign, in this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
            <p>It appears to me a clear Scripture-Truth, that with a View to the <hi>Excluſion</hi> of <hi>Boaſting,</hi> all <hi>Works</hi> of the Unregenerate are, in the Scheme of the Goſpel excluded from being <hi>conditional</hi> of the Beſtowment of <hi>ſpecial Grace.</hi>—And this Truth, I think, is demonſtrable from many plain Texts in ſacred Writ. To inſtance in a few. We read, Tit. 3. 5. <hi>Not by Works of Righteouſneſs, which we have done, but according to his Mercy, be ſaved us.</hi> 2. Tim. 1. 9. <hi>Who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy Calling, not according to our Works, but according to his own Purpoſe and Grace.</hi>—The Apoſtle ſpeaks not of a meer Salvability, but at <hi>actual Salvation</hi>; aſſerts a then-exiſting State; and points out the Method of Introduction into it, both negatively and poſitively.—<hi>Hath ſaved us.</hi> i. e. not only given us the external Means of Salvation, and brought us into his viſible Kingdom, but into a juſtify'd and renew'd State; the Apoſtle ſpeaking this knowingly for himſelf, and charitably for others: nor can any reaſonable Doubt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe here of his uſing the Word [ſaved] in this Senſe. And as to the Method of bringing them into this ſaved State, he peremptorily determines it to be, in its negative View, <hi>not by Works of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which they had done; not according to Works,</hi> any at all whatſoever, previous to and conditional of the Beſtowment of ſaving Grace. He does not meerly ſay, not <hi>for</hi> Works, but not <hi>by</hi> or through them, yea, even not <hi>according to</hi> them, i, e. not with any Reference to them, as a Condition. But, in a poſitive View of the Caſe, 'twas intirely <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to God's Mercy, according to his own Purpoſe and Grace.</hi> His own <hi>Mercy</hi> was all his Motive to <hi>ſaving</hi> them: and his <hi>own Purpoſe</hi> his only Rule in Diſpenſing his Grace.—Again, we read, 1 Cor. 4. 7. <hi>Who maketh thee to differ from another? and what haſt thou, that thou didſt not receive? Now if thou didſt receive it, why doſt thou glory</hi> [or boaſt] <hi>as though thou hadſt not received it</hi>?—So Rom. 4. 2, &amp;c. <hi>If</hi> Abraham <hi>were juſtified by Works, be hath whereof to glory; but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.—To him that worketh, is the Reward not reckoned of Grace, but of Debt.—To him that worketh not, but believeth on Him who juſtifieth</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:006010_0041_1027722275473C88"/>
               <hi>the Ungodly, his Faith is counted for Righteouſneſs.—Unto them God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth Righteouſneſs without Works.</hi>—Again, Rom. 3. 27. <hi>Where is Boaſting then? It is excluded. By what Law? Of works! Nay, but by the Law of Faith.</hi> And Chap. 11. 6. <hi>If by Grace, then it is no more of Works; otherwiſe Grace is no more Grace. But if it be of Works, then is it no more Grace: otherwiſe Work is no more Work.</hi> Again, Eph. 2. 9. <hi>Not of Works, left any Man ſhould boaſt.</hi>—And once more 1 Cor. 1. 29. <hi>That no Fleſh ſhould glory in his Preſence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It appears to me exceeding evident from theſe and other parallel Texts, that with a View to the <hi>Excluſion</hi> of all <hi>Glorying</hi> or <hi>Boaſting</hi> in and of ourſelves, the <hi>Works</hi> of the Unregenerate muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as conſider'd under ſome certain <hi>Notion, Relation,</hi> or <hi>Quality,</hi> to be <hi>excluded</hi> from the Buſineſs of their Recovery out of a periſhing State of Nature into a State of <hi>Salvation,</hi> i. e. a juſtify'd and ſanctfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd State. For, <hi>Boaſting</hi> is ſaid to be excluded, <hi>Not by the Law of Works,</hi> but by the Law of <hi>Faith.</hi> However, <hi>do we make void the Law through Faith? God forbid! Yea, we eſtabliſh the Law.</hi> Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therefore <hi>Works</hi> are not excluded as to their general <hi>Being,</hi> or in Reſpect of our moral <hi>Obligation</hi> to them; but the Law ſtrictly requires them of every Man. And hence it is a clear Conſequence, that ſince the <hi>Law</hi> is not made void through Faith, therefore the Excluſion of Works by the Goſpel muſt be taken in ſome qualified and limited Senſe, and muſt reſpect theſe <hi>Works</hi> as conſider'd under ſome certain ſpecial <hi>Notion, Relation,</hi> or imagin'd <hi>Quality.</hi>—And what can theſe be? I anſwer, They are all poſſible miſtaken Notions, Relations or ſuppoſed Qualities, under which thoſe <hi>Works</hi> being conſidered, they do contain Grounds of <hi>Boaſting.</hi> This is evident from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's ſaying, <hi>Not of Works, laſt any Man ſhould boaſt</hi>: which ſhews, that were it <hi>of Works,</hi> it would threaten this Conſequence, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the View in <hi>excluding Works</hi> is for the ſake of excluding <hi>Boaſting.</hi> But more particularly, the <hi>Works</hi> of the Unregenerate are <hi>excluded</hi> with this View, when conſider'd under the Notion (1.)Of their containing in them a proper <hi>Efficiency</hi> or <hi>Power</hi> to renew and purify their Hearts, cure their moral Diſorders, and recover them to Happineſs, in Concurrence with the external Advantages of the Goſpel.—Or (2.) Of their carrying ſtrict and proper <hi>Merit</hi> in them, to intitle them to Divine ſpecial Grace.—Or (3) Of their having in them ſomething of <hi>Moral Goodneſs</hi> or true <hi>Rectitude</hi> in God's Account, to recommend them to his Acceptance, and us to his Favour.—Or (4.) Of their being an appointed <hi>Condition</hi> in the Goſpel-Covenant, and having the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of ſpecial Grace made to them.—Theſe are ſome of the miſtaken Notions or Reſpects, under which the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:006010_0042_1027722405659780"/>
ſtriving Sinner may be apt to conceive too highly of his Works; and we may juſtly ſuppoſe, his beſt <hi>Works</hi> are, under all ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations of them, <hi>excluded</hi> by the Law of Faith, for the Sake of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding <hi>Boaſting.</hi> Theſe imply ſo many vain Efforts of the fallen Creature in <hi>going about to eſtabliſh his own Righteouſneſs,</hi> and to reſtore himſelf to Happineſs, by Virtue of his own Sufficiency, without <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting himſelf to the Righteouſneſs of God,</hi> or being dependant on his ſovereign Grace for Salvation.</p>
            <p>Now, though it were no difficult Task, to prove, that <hi>Works,</hi> as conſider'd under all the above-mentioned Reſpects, are by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Scheme of Salvation <hi>excluded,</hi> for the ſake of excluding <hi>Boasting</hi>; yet becauſe 'tis the <hi>laſt</hi> only I am here concerned with, I ſhall wholly paſs the others; ſave only ſo far as either of them may ſerve for a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, applicable to my purpoſe, in the preſent Debate.—Two Things are proper to be attempted, for clearing the Point now before us.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That the Works of the Unregenerate are in the Scheme of Man's Salvation <hi>excluded,</hi> for the ſake of excluding <hi>Boaſting.</hi>—And</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Their being excluded with this View, argues that they muſt of Neceſſity be denied the Place of <hi>Conditions</hi> in any Divine Promiſe of ſpecial Grace.</p>
            <p n="1">[I.] I am to ſhew, <hi>that the Works if the Unregenerate, while ſuch, even all their beſt Duties, Endeavours, and Improvements whatſoever, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by themſelves or others to have ſome true Goodneſs and moral Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, whereby they might be acceptable to God, are as considered under that Notion,</hi> excluded <hi>from the Buſineſs of a Sinner's being brought into a ſaved State, for the ſake of excluding</hi> Boaſting.</p>
            <p>The Truth of this may be evine'd from ſundry Conſiderations, As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. From Scripture-Repreſentations of the End deſign'd in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of <hi>Works,</hi> viz. that <hi>Boaſting</hi> may be <hi>excluded.</hi>—By the Texts before cited, it appears, that <hi>Works</hi> are <hi>excluded</hi> for the ſake of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding <hi>Boaſting</hi>: and if ſo, it muſt be concluded, the Deſign is to exclude them under <hi>every Notion,</hi> which contains the Grounds, of or leaves Room for <hi>Boaſting.</hi> By Conſequence, it muſt be the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Holy Ghoſt to exclude them under the Notion of their being <hi>morally good,</hi> in the ſight of God; ſince <hi>Works,</hi> conſider'd in this View, do contain evident Grounds of <hi>Boaſting,</hi> or at leaſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently leave Room for it; Moral Rectitude being the very Image of God, which was the primitive Glory of Man, and the higheſt Excellency that can be attributed to any Doings of the Creature.—It were abſurd, to aſſert that the Scripture ſhould exclude <hi>Works</hi> for the ſake of excluding <hi>Boaſting,</hi> and yet at the ſame time to ſuppoſe
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:006010_0043_1027722619FC34D8"/>
it allows them to have any true <hi>Moral Goodneſs</hi> in them; ſince in this Caſe the deſign would be fruſtated, and <hi>Boaſting</hi> would by no means be excluded, though <hi>Works</hi> were under every ether Notion, but this excluded. Accordingly we find, that the Holy Ghoſt by the Pen of the Apoſtle, in all that he ſays on this Subject in the places above cited, ſhews it plainly to be his Deſign and Drift, to exclude <hi>Works,</hi> as conſider'd under this miſtaken Notion of their having in them <hi>Moral Goodneſs,</hi> or true Holineſs, in the ſight of God. Thus when the Apoſtle uſes ſuch Expreſſions as theſe, <hi>By Grace ye are ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,—not of Works;—Not by Works of Righteouſneſs which we have done,</hi> &amp;c. his Meaning can't be, to deny that he or others then in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd State had before their Converſion done any <hi>Works</hi> whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that were <hi>materially</hi> good, ſuch as praying and the like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Duties; but to diſclaim the <hi>formal Goodneſs</hi> of them, and deny them to have <hi>true Morality</hi> in God's Account, or any ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to his righteous Law, as makes them pleaſing to Him; which the Pride and Ignorance of the fallen Creature flutter him with vain Imaginations of.—All <hi>Works</hi> therefore of the Unregenerate, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd under this Notion of being <hi>morally good,</hi> muſt by the Goſpel be utterly <hi>excluded,</hi> in Order that hereby all Grounds of <hi>Boaſting</hi> might be remov'd, and no Place left for it in the Scheme of Man's Salvation.—Let it be obſerv'd now,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That all Works of the <hi>Unregenerate,</hi> ſuppoſed to be of a true <hi>moral</hi> Complexion, as alone deſcribed, are the very <hi>Works,</hi> which the Scripture clearly points out as deſign'd to be <hi>excluded,</hi> for the ſake of excluding <hi>Boaſting.</hi> Here it may ſuffice to cite two or three plain Texts. Thus, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Even when we were dead in Sins, be hath quickned us together with Chriſt.</hi> (<hi>By Grace ye are ſaved.</hi>) The Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's being brought into a State of Salvation is here, in the ſtrongeſt Language, intirely reſolved into Divine <hi>Grace</hi>: and in like Language the ſame Apoſtle declares it to be <hi>not of our ſelves,—not of Works,</hi> ver. 8, 9. And agreeably in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 6. <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Works are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed</hi> to each other, as incompatible in this Affair. Now that <hi>Works</hi> of the Unregenerate, pretended to be of a ſpiritual and moral Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, are comprehended here, and deſignedly by the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the Buſineſs of their being brought into a <hi>ſaved</hi> State, appears evidently, by his fetching an Argument, for the Illuſtration of Divine Grace, from their <hi>antecedent</hi> State, which he deſcribes as a State of ſpiritual or moral <hi>Death</hi>: and this carries in it the ſtrongeſt Implication of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

tells them, that their Salvation was not <hi>of Works.</hi>—And this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction may be enforc'd, by conſidering the <hi>End,</hi> for which (as he obſerves) <hi>Works</hi> are excluded, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Elſe what Grounds of <hi>Boaſting</hi> could be pretended?—However, to intimate the moral ſpecifick Difference there is between the beſt Duties done <hi>before</hi> Converſion, and the ſame done <hi>after,</hi> he diſtinguiſhes the latter by a peculiar <hi>Epithet,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles them <hi>Good Works.</hi> And the Force of the Argument here, to confirm his Point, lies chiefly in this, That <hi>good Works</hi> (truly ſuch) are <hi>ſubſequent Fruits</hi> of Salvation already begun in the Soul: and therefore they cannot either in the Nature of Things, by their own Efficiency, be the productive Cauſe of it; nor yet in the Scheme of the Goſpel, by Divine Appointment, be the <hi>Covenant-Condition</hi> of it; nor by virtue of any relative or intrinſick Excellency in them, be the <hi>moving</hi> Conſideration with God to beſtow it; becauſe in either of theſe Views of them, an <hi>Antecedency</hi> is ſuppoſed, that is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Scripture, which dates their Exiſtence, not before, but <hi>after</hi> Converſion. <hi>For we are his Workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now can there be any Shadow of a reaſonable Ground to doubt, whether the Apoſtle, where he rejects the Notion of Salvation's being <hi>of Works</hi> (ſo far as it reſpects its Beginning at leaſt) intends ſuch <hi>Works</hi> of the Unregenerate, as they are apt fondly to imagine are of the ſame <hi>moral <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>nd</hi> and <hi>excellent Quality</hi> with thoſe that Believers are ſaid to be <hi>created in Chriſt Jeſus unto,</hi> which the Apoſtle calls <hi>good Works,</hi> and which are ſo indeed, being in point of Principle and End and Manner, as well as Matter, truly (though imperfectly) confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the Nature and Will of God, the Rule and Pattern of moral <hi>Goodneſs.</hi>—Surely it were unworthy the Character of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd Apoſtle, to make him ſo weak and inconſiſtent a Reaſoner, as to argue, that Salvation is <hi>not of Works,</hi> becauſe otherwiſe <hi>Boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> were <hi>not excluded</hi>; and yet all the while to have his Eye here, not to ſuch <hi>Works</hi> as Men flatter themſelves with the Suppoſition of a <hi>Moral Goodneſs</hi> in, and which only can be imagin'd to carry in them
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:006010_0045_1027722C26F6DA80"/>
any Grounds of <hi>Boaſting,</hi> but to others of a quite different Kind, that can be ſuppoſed to afford no poſſible Pretext for this <hi>Boaſting</hi>; for the ſake of <hi>excluding</hi> which, the Apoſtle declares <hi>Works</hi> exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded! — We muſt therefore, were it only in Reverence to the inſpir'd Writer, conclude, that when he ſhuts out <hi>Works</hi> from hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Hand in beginning the Salvation of a Sinner, he means to exclude <hi>all Works</hi> of the Unregenerate, whatever <hi>Goodneſs</hi> or moral Excellence they may conceive to be in them.</p>
            <p>I would ſubjoin here; If I miſtake not, there are theſe two or three Things will clearly follow from the Tenor and Scope of the Apoſtle's Argumentation.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That all <hi>Boaſting</hi> on the Part of the Unregenerate, is ſo founded on that falſe Hypotheſis of their Capacity to do (in their preſent State) Works <hi>morally good,</hi> holy or ſpiritual, in God's Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as that the <hi>excluding</hi> of <hi>Works,</hi> under that Notion or Reſpect will effectually exclude them under every Notion or Reſpect, that implies any the leaſt Ground for <hi>Boaſting</hi>; or, which amounts to the ſame Thing, will effectually exclude all <hi>Boaſting,</hi> in that Caſe.—And this will appear, if we conſider (1.) That it is manifeſtly the Apoſtle's Deſign here, ſo to exclude <hi>Works,</hi> as by that Means to exclude all <hi>Boaſting.</hi> Says he. <hi>Not of Works, leſt any Man ſhould Boaſt</hi>: q. d. Not of <hi>Works,</hi> conſider'd under any Notion whatever that contains in it Grounds of <hi>Boaſting.</hi>—And (2)That with this View, he ſets himſelf to prove, that <hi>good Works,</hi> truly ſuch, are <hi>conſequential</hi> to Regeneration, and ſo an <hi>impoſſible</hi> Suppoſition <hi>before</hi> it. Thus his Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings ſtand in Connection:—<hi>Not of Works, leſt any Man ſhould Boaſt. For we are God's Workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works.</hi> This proves, that when he uſes the excluſive Phraſe, <hi>Not of Works,</hi> he muſt have his Eye to ſuch <hi>Works</hi> only, as being ſuppoſed to have in them the true Excellency of <hi>good Works,</hi> do under that Notion contain Grounds of <hi>Boaſting.</hi> And now to ſhew, that in the Goſpel-Scheme of <hi>Salvation</hi> there's no Room left for any ſuch <hi>Boaſting</hi> he deſtroys the very <hi>Notion</hi> on which this is founded, by aſſuring us that Works truly <hi>good</hi> do <hi>follow</hi> Converſion, or the new <hi>Creation in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and therefore can never have Place in an <hi>unregenerate</hi> State. This View of his Reaſoning makes it cloſe, and effectual to cut off <hi>Boaſting</hi>: but to take it in any other View, not conſiſtent with this, will (for ought I can ſee) leave it looſe, incoherent, and utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concluſive to his Purpoſe; which it were moſt unworthy and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to ſuppoſe in the Caſe of an Apoſtle, writing under divine Inſpiration.—Beſides, this Argument may be ſtrengthen'd by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering (as before ſuggeſted) the <hi>Nature of Things.</hi> For, <hi>ſeeing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

               </gap> ſuch an one of <hi>glorying</hi> in himſelf, or <hi>boaſting</hi> in any Efforts of his own towards Salvation?

            </p>
            <p>Moreover,</p>
            <p>(3.)

            <p>The Truth I am defending, is clearly held forth, I think, in thoſe other Words above-quoted from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Who maketh thee to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from another? And what haſt thou, that thou didſt not receive? Now if thou didſt receive it, why doſt thou glory</hi> (or boaſt) <hi>as though thou hadſt not received it</hi>? The <hi>Deſign</hi> of the Apoſtle here appears to me
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:006010_0047_1027723102AACCE0"/>
very much the ſame, as in the former Text; namely, to cut off all Pretences for <hi>Boaſting</hi> (whether of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Profeſſors, or their Teachers) in their reſpective Attainments, under the Advantages of the Goſpel, either in point of ſpecial Grace, or extraordinary Gifts. And the <hi>Median</hi> he makes Uſe of here, is for Subſtance the ſame too; namely, the ſhutting out <hi>Works,</hi> ſuppoſed to have moral Worthineſs it them, from being die procuring Cauſe of their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, and reſolving them into the ſovereign Pleaſure of the <hi>Divine Donor;</hi> to whom they ſtood Debtors for all their Receipts.—Here are two Queſtions or Demands. The Firſt is <hi>Who maketh thee to differ</hi>? To which the Anſwer, here plainly imply'd, is, That Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Benefactor, who is the ſovereign Author of every good and perfect Gift. It's He, that puts the <hi>Diſtinction</hi> upon Men, when they excell others in valuable Attainments 'Tis the Reſult of his free Favour, 'Tis not any antecedent moral Excellency in any thus diſtinguiſh'd, that <hi>makes the Difference</hi>: Or in Scripture-Language, <hi>Not by Works of Righteouſneſs, which they have done</hi>—The other Queſtion is, <hi>What haſt thou, that thou didſt not recieve</hi> q. d. Theſe your diſtinguiſhing Attainments under the Goſpel in which you are. ſo apt to glory, are you not indebted for them to the <hi>Father of Lights</hi> and <hi>God of all Grace,</hi> who has freely given them to you! Whether as to ſanctifying Grace, or extraordinary Gifts, are you not a meer <hi>Receiver!</hi> Had you Power in your ſelf to acquire them; or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to purchaſe them! Or with regard to <hi>ſpecial Grace,</hi> had you even any <hi>antecedent</hi> moral or ſpiritual Excellency, to intitle you to it! Surely, you muſt confeſs, It is <hi>not of Works.</hi> For you could do None <hi>worthy of God,</hi> before you <hi>receiv'd</hi> his ſpecial Grace: And here you was a meer <hi>Receiver,</hi> in Oppoſition to any Right whatever, or active Acquirement, on your part. You are in every reſpect wholly a <hi>Docter</hi> to the abſolute Grace of the Divine Given.—Thus, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Apoſtle's <hi>Queſtion</hi> in this its natural and unſore'd Meaning, there appears in it a juſt. Foundation for his Concluſion, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, by way of Query again,—<hi>Now if thou didſt receive it why then doſt thou glory, as If thou didſt not receive it!</hi> A very cloſe Expoſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and carrying in it Matter of full Conviction to the Reaſon and Conſcience of thoſe he wrote to, that they had no poſſible Room left for <hi>boaſting</hi> on the Account of any their diſtinguiſhing Attainments. It's good Argument why Men ſhould not glory in any Gifts of <hi>Nature,</hi> or common <hi>Providence,</hi> becauſe theſe are what they have <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</hi> But ſurely theſe were not the only, nor the principal Things, that the Apoſtle moſt probably had in his Eye, or that the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oaſted in. And though <hi>extraordinary Gifts,</hi> of the ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:006010_0048_1027723560C56398"/>
and miraculous kind, are included here; yet certainly <hi>ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Grace</hi> is by no Means to be thought excluded, as ſome pretend. For how would this comport with the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Reaſoning and with his main Deſign here? Would not a proud Elation of Mind in any under the View of a ſuppoſed moral Goodneſs in their Endeavours to get <hi>ſpecial Grace,</hi> be as really in the Apoſtle's Senſe <hi>Glorying</hi> or <hi>Boaſting,</hi> as an undue Lifting-up themſelves under the View of their Endeavours to acquire thoſe extraordinary <hi>Gifts</hi>? And is not the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of <hi>ſpecial Grace</hi> by the Creature's own Doings, rather higher Ground of <hi>Boaſting,</hi> than what appears in the other Caſe; by how much 'tis of a more excellent Nature and ſuperior Importance? If the one's being <hi>received</hi> is a Conſideration ſufficient to ſilence all <hi>Boaſting,</hi> in that Particular, why ſhould not the ſame Conſideration be allowed equal Force in the Caſe of the other, which is as much <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi> alſo? Surelv, by Parity of Reaſon, at leaſt, the Apoſtle's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke to the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Boaſter is applicable to the Caſe of <hi>glorying</hi> in an imagin'd <hi>moral Goodneſs</hi> of unregenerate Men's Endeavours to attain <hi>converting Grace.</hi> For any, upon a ſuppos'd Attainment of this Grace, to aſcribe it to an imaginary moral Excellency in his own Efforts, while unregenerate, ſeems evidently to be a <hi>glorying in it, as though be received it not</hi>; and ſo brings him under the Correction of the Apoſtle's <hi>Rod,</hi> as here exerciſed.</p>
            <p>The Truth, as it appears to me, is (1.) That all <hi>Works</hi> morally good and approvable before God, are utterly <hi>impracticable</hi> by the fallen Creature, whilſt unrenewed, and under the Dominion of Sin; as, Sir, you concede the Subject of our preſent Controverſy to be.—And (2.) That for a poor Sinner, in this his guilty, impotent, and forlorn State, to be elated or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

the ſaved of the Lord, and leſſens their ſenſible Obligations in point of Gratitude; whilſt at the ſame Time it exalts the fallen Creature, quiets him in his own Sufficiency, tempts him to delay his Concern about Salvation, leads him to truſt in himſelf when eſſaying Converſion to God, and ſtands a Bar in the way of his Coming to God by Jeſus Chriſt, for Mercy abſolutely free, and unpromiſed, as to any Duties and Doings of his: I ſay, Becauſe this <hi>Boaſting</hi> is ſuch a moral Evil in it ſelf, and is pregnant with ſo many other Evils, hence it is undoubtedly, that the Holy Ghoſt in Scripture ſo repeatedly and with ſo much Earneſtneſs inſiſts upon the <hi>Excluſion</hi> of it.—And (4) Becauſe this Sin of <hi>Boaſting</hi> is ſo inſeparably connected with the Opinion of true moral Goodneſs in the <hi>Works</hi> of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate, as that it is impoſſible to <hi>exclude</hi> or reject the former, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out alſo <hi>excluding</hi> and diſallowing the latter (the Reaſon whereof is exceeding obvious, viz. becauſe they that entertain that Opinion, do entertain a <hi>falſe</hi> Notion of their own Excellency; and they that build upon a <hi>falſe</hi> Notion of their own Excellency, muſt needs be <hi>puffed up</hi> and <hi>boaſt in themſelves</hi>) therefore the one is excluded for the ſake of excluding the other. <hi>Not of Works, leſt any Man ſhould boaſt.—What haſt thou,</hi> in point of ſuppoſed true Goodneſs and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Religion, <hi>that thou haſt not received,</hi> at the hand of Divine ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign <hi>Grace</hi>? <hi>Now if thou didſt receive it thus, why doſt thou boaſt, as though thou hadſt not thus received it</hi>; Or, as if it were <hi>not of Grace,</hi> but <hi>of Works</hi>?</p>
            <p>I ſhall now ſhut up the preſent Argument, with this ſummary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of all the foregoing Reaſonings under it. Since 'tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputably evident from the ſeveral Scriptures above recited, that all <hi>Works,</hi> proceeding Salvation actually begun in Converſion, are in the Goſpel-Scheme <hi>excluded</hi> for the Sake of excluding all <hi>Boaſting</hi>: — And ſince it thence follows with like Clearneſs, that they are excluded under every <hi>Notion</hi> of them, that contains Reaſons or Grounds of <hi>Boaſting</hi>:— And ſince it is abundantly evident, that conſider'd under the Notion of their having true <hi>moral Goodneſs</hi> in them, they contain the Grounds and Reaſons of <hi>Boaſting</hi>:—And ſince it has been evidenced, that the Holy Ghoſt in Scripture doth actually and on Deſign <hi>exclude</hi> them under <hi>this</hi> Notion, that thereby all <hi>Boaſting</hi> might be excluded :—And laſtly, ſince it hath been made appear, that <hi>Glorying,</hi> or <hi>Boaſting,</hi> in the Caſe before us, is ſo founded in or inſeparably connected with <hi>that Idea</hi> of the Doings of the Unregenerate (their having ſome moral Excellency or true Holineſs in them) as that it is impoſſible, ſuch <hi>Glorying</hi> ſhould other-wiſe be totally <hi>excluded,</hi> than by excluding all ſuch <hi>Works,</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:006010_0050_1027723B9142DA90"/>
under that Idea:—From theſe ſeveral Conſiderations ſaid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, I ſhall take it at preſent for a Point fully prov'd, <hi>That all Works</hi> of the Unregenerate, ſuppoſed to have the ſaid idea an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to them, are under that Notion certainly <hi>excluded,</hi> for the ſake of excluding <hi>Boaſting,</hi> from the Buſineſs of Sinners being bro't into a State of Salvation.—The other Point propoſed was—</p>
            <p n="2">[2.] That all <hi>Works</hi> of the Unregenerate, done by them whilſt ſuch, and reſpected by them as morally good, being thus <hi>excluded,</hi> it is a neceſſary Conſequence, That they can't poſſibly be included in the <hi>Covenant-Promiſe,</hi> as reveal'd <hi>Conditions,</hi> upon the Performance of which, God has engag'd to confer <hi>ſpecial Grace</hi> upon Sinners.— This appears to me a genuine and clear Inference from what has been ſaid. For, if all Performances and Endeavours of Men, previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to a renewed State, are, as reſpected under the Notion of their being morally Good before God, <hi>excluded</hi> the Buſineſs of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to Salvation (or, which is the ſame in Effect, deny'd to have any <hi>Exiſtence,</hi> as conſider'd under that formal Notion) in Order that thereby all <hi>Boasting</hi> in and of themſelves might be ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; it muſt hence inevitably follow, that they can have no poſſible Place in the Goſpel Covenant, as <hi>Conditions,</hi> to which God has made a Promiſe of <hi>ſpecial Grace.</hi>—If, as conſider'd under that Notion of their being <hi>morally good</hi> or holy and ſpiritual, in God's Account, the Scripture denies them any actual Being, it muſt neceſſarily deny them alſo, as conſider'd under the Notion of their being <hi>Conditions,</hi> in a <hi>Promiſe</hi> of ſpecial Grace made to the Doings of the <hi>Unregenerate.</hi> Otherwiſe, we make the Goſpel ſolemnly to eſtabliſh that for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which at the ſame time it has excluded as a meer <hi>Non-Entity</hi>; having no <hi>Exiſtence,</hi> as morally conſider'd, but in the vain Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the haughty Sinner. What is this, but to make the Goſpel as it were <hi>deſtroy it ſelf</hi>? Here were "ſad Havock" indeed!</p>
            <p>That which remains now before me, is, to obviate ſome <hi>Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> that may perhaps be brought againſt me, to invalidate my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings in Anſwer to you and my Way of arguing from ſuch Texts of Scripture as I have alledg'd againſt you.—And here it may be ſuggeſted in Oppoſition to me,</p>

            <p>I anſwer. That in general by <hi>Works,</hi> in this Controverſy, it ſeems to me agreed between us, are meant the apparent <hi>good Works</hi> of Perſons not yet throughly converted t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If we underſtand <hi>Merit</hi> in the <hi>abſolute</hi> and moſt <hi>proper</hi> Senſe them I ſay, it muſt be a great Miſtake, to ſuppoſe that the excluding or denying of <hi>this</hi> only amounts to the full Senſe of the Scripture, when it excludes <hi>Works,</hi> for the Sake of excluding <hi>Boaſting.</hi>—But I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade my ſelf, Sir, there's no Need of arguing this Point with you.

Now by this Kind of <hi>Merit,</hi> I conceive, muſt be intended at leaſt ſome moral Excellency, true Worthineſs, Goodneſs, or Virtue in their Works, before God. And is this, Sir, the <hi>Merit,</hi> which you renounce? Is the Excluſion of this Kind of <hi>Merit</hi> the juſt Import of your Expreſſions, where you tell us (P. 24.) <hi>In his</hi> (i.e. Chriſt's <hi>Right we muſt plead</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> for ſpecial Grace) <hi>who has purchaſed this Benefit for us; and not in the Virtue or Merit of any Thing we do, which we can only humbly conſider as meer Qualifications,</hi> &amp;c. Do you (I ſay) really mean here to diſclaim all Pretence of Merit, in the loweſt and largeſt Senſe of the Word, as above explain'd? If ſo, I anſwer then, there muſt be a palpable <hi>Inconſiſtency</hi> in your Scheme: Since you ſtrenuouſly inſiſt, throughout your Letter, that God in diſpenſing his <hi>ſpecial Grace</hi> acts not in the Character of an abſolute Proprietor or ſovereign Benefactor, at perfect Liberty to give or to withhold the Benefit as he pleaſeth, but only <hi>in the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of a moral Governor and righteous Judge of the Behaviour and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of his Creatures,</hi> and diſpenſing it or not <hi>according to their Conduct in the Uſe of the Talent they've receiv'd.</hi> Now, if this be ſo,. I beg to be inform'd what that <hi>Behaviour of the Creature</hi> is, according to you, which is thus the Rule of God's Diſpenſation in this Matter. Can it be any other than a true <hi>moral</hi> Behaviour, in its formal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, pleaſing to God? Is it poſſible that the <hi>Creature's Behaviour</hi>

ſhould paſs the Teſt with him as a <hi>moral Governor</hi> and <hi>righteous Judge</hi>; and yet ac the ſame Time not have any true <hi>moral Goodneſs</hi> in it! Which it cannot have, and ſo cannot have the lower Kind of Merit, Worthineſs, or recommending Excellency, unleſs it be as well <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally</hi> as <hi>materially</hi> good. How evidently impoſſible the Caſe! And how abſurd the Suppoſition! For a Thing to <hi>be,</hi> and <hi>not</hi> to be, at the ſame Time and in the ſame Reſpect, is ſcarce a greater Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicition.</p>
            <p>Now ſince there is this notorious Incoherence in your Scheme, and both Parts of a Contradiction can't be true, one of the repugnant Principle your muſt certainly give up. And give up which you will, for ought I can ſee, your Scheme muſt fall with it. For if you part with your Principle, of <hi>God's acting</hi> in this Affair <hi>as a moral Governor and righteous Judge if his Creatures Behaviour and Improvements,</hi> making this the <hi>Rule</hi> according to which he diſpenſeth his <hi>ſpecial Grace</hi> to the fallen Creature; I ſay, if you give up this Point, it muſt then una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably follow, that God herein acts only as an <hi>abſolute Proprietor</hi> and <hi>ſovereign Benefactor:</hi> which being all that Mr. <hi>Cooke</hi> or I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for, there's an End of the Debate. Or, if you give up the other Principle (which you ſay you allow) of <hi>the fallen Creatures pleading.</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> for ſpecial Grace) MEERLY <hi>in the Virtue of what</hi> CHRIST <hi>hath done for us, or in Right of his Purchaſe, and not at all in the Virtue or Merit of any Thing we do;</hi> I ſay, if you relinquiſh this Point, then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, for ought I can ſee, that you muſt aſſert a ſort of <hi>Merit</hi> or <hi>Worthineſs,</hi> even in the <hi>Works</hi> of an unregenerate Man, who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted hereby in a Promiſe, which paſſes over to him. <hi>Right</hi> to ſpecial Grace, pleadable before God. But what a vain Imagination is this (as ſhewn before) and how contrary to the whole Tenor of the Scriptures!—In ſhort, when you profeſs to <hi>allow,</hi> that we are <hi>not</hi> at all to <hi>plead in the Virtue or Merit of any Thing we do,</hi> your Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing muſt be, either to teach us, that although in Fact there is true <hi>Virtue</hi> or <hi>Merit</hi> in our Doings, ſome moral Goodneſs or Worthineſs which ſpeaks them proper <hi>Qualification</hi> for the Benefit of ſpecial Grace, and although the actual Subject of theſe Qualifications has a <hi>Right</hi> to this Grace paſſed over to him by God's <hi>Promiſe,</hi> yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs that we muſt not <hi>plead</hi> this Right, when asking, for the promis'd Benefit; in which View of your Words, you renounce, not <hi>the Virtue or Merit of what we do,</hi> but only the making it a <hi>Plea.</hi>— A poor lean Conceſſion! And not half enough, to clear you of ſetting up that <hi>Boaſting,</hi> which the Goſpel <hi>excludes.</hi>—Or, if you mean any<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Otherwiſe, as I've already argu'd, that <hi>Boaſting,</hi> which the Goſpel ſhuts out can never effectually be <hi>excluded:</hi> but there will always lie in the Sinner's way a very invincible Temptation, to <hi>truſt in himſelf that he is righteous, or to look to be ſaved by Works of Righteouſneſs, which he hath done, and not according to God's Mercy, by the Waſhing of Regeneration.</hi>—Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs what faith the Scripture? <hi>Not of Works, leſt any Man ſhould boaſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Inconſiſtency here urged againſt your Principles, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Sir, is nothing peculiar to you: but is common to thoſe in the <hi>Arminian</hi> Scheme, They all profeſs wholly to diſclaim the Plea of <hi>Merit,</hi> in the Caſe before us; and yet they aſſert, with you, God's diſpenſing his <hi>efficacious Aid</hi> or <hi>ſpecial Grace,</hi> not as an abſolute ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Benefactor, but as a <hi>moral Governor and righteous Judge of the Behaviour and Improvements of his Creatures</hi>: A Principle, I think, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily implying the Suppoſition of ſome inherent <hi>true moral Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency</hi> in the Sinner's Doings; which is <hi>Merit,</hi> of the lower kind. And this <hi>Worthineſs</hi> they hold (with you) to be the <hi>Qualification</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of <hi>ſpecial Grace</hi>: to which Grace they alſo with you aſſert a <hi>Right,</hi> by God's Promiſe, paſſed over to the Man ſo qualified. Tho' in ſome Senſe they renounce the Doctrine of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> yet they ſpeak of the <hi>Grace</hi> of God even in the firſt ſpecial Inſtance, as <hi>ſtipulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Good and of the unrenew'd Man's <hi>Endeavours</hi> (whilſt ſuch) as the <hi>Covenant-Condition,</hi> &amp;c. Which, at leaſt, ſeems to be ſetting up a Merit of Congruity.

            </p>
            <p>In brief, Sir, You and they may ſoften your Language as you pleaſe, and be it as it will in the point of Conſiſtency with <hi>yourſelves,</hi> yet ſo long as you are for a <hi>Method of Grace,</hi> according to the Scheme de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended

Nature or deny the Being of <hi>Grace</hi>: and on the contrary, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it to be <hi>by Grace,</hi> is to deſtroy the Nature or deny the Being of <hi>Works.</hi> How then can theſe unalterable <hi>Oppoſites</hi> poſſibly be made to agree in this Affair? The Attempt is vain, and will be found an eternal Impoſſibility, ſo long as the Goſpel <hi>excludes Works</hi> in the Manner it does, with a View to ſecure the Honour of God's <hi>Grace,</hi> and intirely remove every Ground of Man's <hi>Boaſting.</hi> For ſome Ground of <hi>Boaſting</hi> will remain, ſo long as Salvation is imagin'd to be <hi>of Works,</hi> whether in Regard of any true moral <hi>Worthineſs</hi> in them, or any <hi>conditional Right</hi> annexed to them, which God as a <hi>moral Governor</hi> is ſuppoſed to act in Conſideration of, when he beſtows his <hi>ſpecial Grace</hi> on the fallen Creature.

            <p>But, it it be further objected here,</p>
            <p>OBJECT. 4. <hi>That, granting</hi> the Works <hi>of Unregenerate Men,</hi> (<hi>ſuppos'd</hi> morally good) <hi>to be by the Goſpel, for the ſake of excluding</hi> Boaſting, <hi>all of them excluded from being</hi> (under that Notion) <hi>the Condition, to which a Promiſe of ſpecial Grace is made; and granting, that to make Works conditional in this Caſe</hi> as conſider'd under that Notion, <hi>would be to eſtabliſh that</hi> Boaſting, <hi>which the Goſpel excludes</hi>: yet <hi>it will by no Means follow upon theſe Conceſſions, that the</hi> Hypotheſis <hi>of their being made</hi> conditional, <hi>is ſo eſſentially connected with and ſo intirely founded in that Notion of them, as that we cannot rationally ſuppoſe them conſider'd, in the conditional Promiſe under ſome</hi> other <hi>Reſpect or View, fairly conſiſtent with the perfect</hi> Excluſion <hi>of</hi> Boaſting.</p>
            <p>For Anſwer to this plauſible Pretence, it may ſuffice to ſay in brief;—I know of none that deny God's acting in this Affair as a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Proprietor and abſolute Benefactor, who do not at the ſame Time aſſert his acting in it as a <hi>moral Governor and righteous Judge of the Behaviour of his Creatures.</hi> But how is it poſſible, He ſhould act in this laſt Character, without <hi>reſpecting</hi> at all the <hi>moral Goodneſs</hi> of their Behaviour? Can he be ſuppos'd, while acting in this Capacity, and ſo neceſſarily having an Eye to his Rule of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet to have no Eye to the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of that <hi>Behaviour,</hi> in point of its Conformity to his preceptive Will, although it be the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd <hi>Condition,</hi> on which he has ſuſpended his Promiſe of ſpecial Grace? If the <hi>Behaviour</hi> have true <hi>moral Excellency</hi> in it, why ſhould
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:006010_0058_1026E533512340B8"/>
not <hi>this</hi> he both reſpected in the conditional Promiſe, and ey'd by him in his Execution of it?—Nor am I able to conceive what <hi>other poſſible Notion</hi> of Men's Behaviour, any can ſuppoſe <hi>reſpected</hi> in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this <hi>Conditional</hi> of the promised Bleſſing, but what, if receiv'd and acted upon, will certainly, be <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> (as well as that of <hi>moral Goodneſs</hi>) with the intire and abſolute <hi>Excluſion of Boaſting</hi> in a Goſpel-Account.—To reduce the Controverſy here ta an Iſſue, I wou'd a little further argue the Point, after I have obſerv'd, That in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>other</hi> View or Notion <hi>Works</hi> may poſſibly be conſider'd in this Affair, yet if the Notion of their <hi>moral Goodneſs</hi> be at all taken in, it ſeems to me impoſſible perfectly to exclude <hi>Boaſting.</hi> I ſay then, Either this Notion of <hi>moral Goodneſs,</hi> in the <hi>Works</hi> of Unregenerate Men is quite <hi>excluded</hi> from this Affair of their being made <hi>Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal</hi> of the Beſtowment of ſpecial Grace; Or it is <hi>not</hi> quite exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.—Now, if you aſſume, and ſay. That this Notion of them is <hi>intirely excluded,</hi> i.e. if you give up the Point of their <hi>moral Goodneſs,</hi> and allow that there is nothing of <hi>true Rectitude</hi> or <hi>godly Sincerity</hi> in the beſt <hi>Endeavours</hi> of the Man (according to your Deſcription) in <hi>a middle</hi> State, neither <hi>relentleſs</hi> nor yet <hi>thoroughly converted</hi>: To this I reply, that upon ſuch a View of the Caſe it don't appear to me in the leaſt rational, to ſuppoſe <hi>Endeavours</hi> of this Kind made <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> in a Divine Promiſe, upon any <hi>other</hi> Notion of them whatever. If God in diſpenſing ſpecial Grace to ſuch a Man, does at all reſpect his <hi>Endeavours,</hi> as the Conſideration upon which he acts, He muſt (I think) reſpect them either as <hi>morally good, or not.</hi>—But now to ſuppoſe Him acting herein upon the Conſideration of Works <hi>not morally good,</hi> is to ſuppoſe a Thing that has no Congruity with the Idea of a <hi>moral Governor and righteous Judge.</hi> If you don't maintain the Being of ſome true moral Rectitude and <hi>godly Sincerity</hi> in theſe Doings of the ſtriving Sinner, while you plead for their <hi>Conditionality,</hi> methinks you had better diveſt them of this too, in Honour to God's rectoral Holineſs, rather than ſuppoſe Him annexing a great and precious Promiſe to a morally unfit <hi>Condition,</hi> or diſpenſing a promiſed Bleſſing without reſpecting any <hi>Goodneſs</hi> in his Creature's Behaviour, tho' made the Rule of his Adminiſtration. I cannot but think it infinitely more honorary to God, to ſuppoſe with <hi>us,</hi> that in this Affair of diſpenſing ſpecial Grace to the Unregenerate, He acts as a <hi>ſovereign Benefactor,</hi> out of abſolute, and (meaning in Oppoſition to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Promiſe) out of <hi>unpromiſed,</hi> and irreſpective Mercy, <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the meer good Pleaſure of his Will.</hi> I think, you muſt be oblig'd to come to this Concluſion, if you renounce all Pretence of <hi>moral Goodneſs</hi> in the Condition you plead for; ſince, without your ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing

ſome true <hi>moral Excellency</hi> in the Creatures <hi>Behaviour,</hi> I dont ſee how you can poſſibly reconcile its being a Divinely eſtabliſh'd <hi>Condition</hi> in this Affair with the Idea of God as a <hi>moral Governor</hi> and <hi>righteous Judge.</hi>—But after all, it may be you will on the other hand aſſume, and ſay, That you allow of ſome true <hi>moral Goodneſs</hi> in theſe Doings of the ſeeking ſtriving Sinner, though not yet intirely devoted to God in Chriſt, and allow their being (at leaſt partly) under <hi>that Notion</hi> made <hi>conditional</hi> in the Caſe before us. Now if ſo you aſſume, then I anſwer, That <hi>whatever other</hi> Notion you may imagine reſpected in making the Sinners Endeavours <hi>conditional</hi> of the Beſtowment of ſpecial Grace, and however conſiſtent you may ſuppoſe <hi>that</hi> to be with the <hi>Excluſion</hi> of <hi>Boaſting</hi>; Yet if this Notion of <hi>moral Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> be at all admitted in the Caſe, ſome Ground of <hi>Boaſting</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly remains, which (as we have ſeen) the Goſpel-Scheme Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation intirely <hi>excludes</hi> and with a View to the Excluſion of this does <hi>exclude</hi> all <hi>Works</hi> that contain any Grounds of <hi>Boaſting,</hi> as do theſe pretended <hi>good Works,</hi> done before converting <hi>Grace,</hi> and made <hi>conditional</hi> of it.— In ſhort, the Goſpel (as often obſerved) <hi>excludes</hi> ſuch <hi>Works,</hi> for the ſake of excluding <hi>Boaſting.</hi> It <hi>excludes</hi> Works, denies their very Being or Exiſtence, under the Notion of <hi>good Works,</hi> and conſequently denies their <hi>Conditionality</hi>: which is, to all Intents and Purpoſes, ſufficiently to exclude <hi>Boaſting.</hi>— Whereas now your Scheme, which ſets up <hi>Works</hi> of the Unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate for a <hi>Condition</hi> in the Covenant of Grace, does on the contrary ſuppoſe the actual <hi>Exiſtence</hi> of <hi>good Works</hi> before Converſion, and claims a peculiar Honour for them in the Affair of Man's Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: which certainly leaves Room for that <hi>Boaſting,</hi> the Goſpel deſigns to <hi>exclude.</hi>—If after all I have offer'd from Scripture you ſtill diſpute there being any Ground of <hi>Boaſting,</hi> in this Caſe, I will offer this plain Argument from Reaſon, for your Conviction.—For the fallen Creature, not yet <hi>renewed in the Spirit of his Mind,</hi> but <hi>under the Dominion and Guilt of Sin</hi> (as is the Caſe of the <hi>ſtriving Sinner</hi> according to your own Deſcription) for <hi>this Man</hi> (I ſay) to entertain an Opinion of <hi>moral Rectitude</hi> and <hi>true Goodneſs</hi> in any of his Doings of Improvements, is to entertain a <hi>falſe</hi> Opinion of <hi>his own Excellence</hi>: and ſo far as he does this, he is undoubtedly <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>high-minded,</hi> in the Account of the Goſpel. And now for <hi>this Man,</hi> this poor empty vain Man, thus puffed up with a falſe Conceit of his own Doings, to ſtamp them with the dignifying Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>Conditions</hi> in God's Covenant of Grace paſſing over to him a <hi>Right</hi> to promiſed Bleſſings, This is what, I think, includes in its eſſential Idea that very <hi>Boaſting,</hi> which the Goſpel excludes;

or at leaſt, you muſt allow, this leaves large Room for it, and lay in the Sinner's Way a powerful Temptation to this Soul-ruining moral Evil.—Upon theſe Grounds, I leave it (Sir) with you to conſider ſeriouſly whether you are not, ſo far as you have been ſetting up and pleading for this <hi>Opinion</hi> and this <hi>Character</hi> of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate Man's Doings, juſtly chargeable with ſetting up and pleading for that ſame <hi>Boaſting,</hi> which the Goſpel-Scheme of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has moſt abſolutely <hi>excluded,</hi> or deny'd any Place to in this Affair: as we have ſeen from a Variety of <hi>Scriptures.</hi> And the Conſtruction I have made of the ſacred Text, I doubt not might eaſily be confirm'd from the <hi>Articles</hi> and <hi>Homilies</hi> of your own Church, from the concurrent Senſe of the <hi>Engliſh Reformers,</hi> from the publick Confeſſions of the <hi>foreign</hi> Proteſtant Churches, &amp;c. which would all come in as a <hi>Cloud of Witneſſes</hi> on my Side of the Queſtion. But I wave human Authorities, in the preſent Debate.</p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, while you riſe ſo high in your uncandid Reflections upon Mr. <hi>Cooke</hi> and others with him, as even to tax them of <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the Simplicity of the Goſpel,</hi> you ſee for what Reaſons I think the Imputation, (black as it is) rebounds on your own Head. For it muſt needs be a warping from the true Scheme of Salvation, and ſo far a <hi>corrupting</hi> the Goſpel, to ſet up that guilty <hi>Boaſting,</hi> which is here condemned and <hi>excluded.</hi>—But this Matter muſt on the whole be ſubmitted to others impartial Judgment. However, In the mean Time, I cannot refrain making here a ſhort Remark on the obvious <hi>Tendency</hi> of your Opinion in the preſent Point, and of what you have offered in Defence of it, to check the Concern and to ſtifle the Convictions of <hi>awakened</hi> Sinners which you muſt confeſs of <hi>dangerous</hi> Conſequence, I readily confeſs the Scheme you have advanced is what <hi>Fleſh and Blood</hi> will not be likely to take much Offence at, but it would rather afford a pleaſing Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the fallen Creature, and be likely to bear down and keep under his riſing Fears from time to time, to ſooth and huſh his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing Conſcience, and while in Heart really purſuing the World as his chief Good, yet to flatter him with the Hopes of his finally obtaining Heaven too; as having the <hi>Grace of God</hi> well ſecured to him by a <hi>conditional Promiſe,</hi> and brought hereby as it were within the Command of his own <hi>Endeavours</hi> and <hi>Improvements.</hi>— Allow me, Sir, to obſerve, 'Tis no Wonder at all therefore, if in a Time when Religion runs <hi>low</hi> among a People (as it ever will upon an awful Suſpenſion of a ſpecial Divine Influence) Multitudes of the World go over to a <hi>Self-pleaſing</hi> Opinion, and ridicule the Notion of any Danger by it. However, this we are well aſſured of, that
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:006010_0061_1027725C60335CC8"/>
according as the <hi>Work of God</hi> has been <hi>revived,</hi> time after time, ſo that the <hi>Truth</hi> at the ſame Time revived and prevailed; and it is remarkable, through all the Viciſſitudes that have paſſed over the Church, this important <hi>Truth</hi> which I am now pleading for, has been preſerved alive, at lead in the inconteſtible Grounds of it, in all the publick <hi>Confeſſions</hi> of the <hi>Reformed,</hi> from Age to Age; nor has the contrary <hi>Error</hi> ever to this Day, that I can learn, obtained a Place in ſo much as one <hi>publick</hi> Confeſſion of Faith, avow'd in any Proteſtant Church. And this is our Conſolation, amidſt all Dangers threatning the Truth in a Day of Degeneracy, that ſtill the <hi>Spirit of Truth</hi> has the ſame Power and the ſame Grace as ever, and will not let the <hi>Word of Truth</hi> in any Iota of it utterly fail and periſh, but will ſecure it in the Mouth and Heart of all that are <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s, as tot the great Matters of it eſpecially.</p>
            <p>And here, Sir, I might well enough conclude; relying on what has already been ſaid, as ſufficient to the Purpoſe of confirming Mr. <hi>Cooke</hi>'s two Arguments, which I undertook to defend. But I muſt beg your Patience a little longer, whilſt I add an Argument or two, that are of a more <hi>general</hi> Extent, and of no ſmall Weight with <hi>me</hi> in this Controverſy, and whilſt I give you a few further Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on ſome Paſſages of your <hi>Letter,</hi> which hitherto I've not found a Place for.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Argument,</hi> in particular, that I would a while inſiſt on, is this. <hi>If any</hi> Endeavours <hi>of the</hi> Unregenerate, <hi>under the Dominion and Guilt of Sin, as they are, be the</hi> Condition, <hi>to which</hi> ſpecial Grace <hi>is promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, theſe muſt be ſuppoſed ſo, either as Doings</hi> acceptable and pleaſing <hi>to God, or elſe as</hi> diſpleaſing <hi>and</hi> offenſive <hi>to him.</hi> (For I know of no <hi>Medium.</hi>) But, <hi>under</hi> neither <hi>of theſe Views of them, can theſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours be the Condition, to which ſpecial Grace is promiſed.</hi>—</p>
            <p n="1">1. Not under the Notion of their being <hi>acceptable</hi> and <hi>pleaſing</hi> to God; becauſe there is no Foundation in <hi>Truth</hi> for ſuch a Notion of them.—For the Scripture moſt expreſly aſſures us, Rom. 8.8. <hi>They that are in the Fleſh cannot pleaſe God.</hi> By them that are in the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> I underſtand, not meerly the <hi>obſtinate relentleſs Sinner,</hi> but alſo <hi>the Man</hi> you deſcribe, <hi>who</hi> though <hi>ſeriouſly concerned to become</hi> renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Spirit of his Mind, <hi>yet is not throughly converted from Sin to God,</hi> ſuch an one, <hi>not having the Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> ſtill <hi>in the Fleſh</hi> or under the Government of a <hi>fleſhly Mind.</hi> Whatever <hi>fair Shew in the Fleſh</hi> he make, yet under all his <hi>ſeemingly Religiouſneſs</hi> is in Truth <hi>carnally minded</hi>: The <hi>Fleſh</hi> is his predominant Principle. And indeed, Sir, as you yourſelf have conceded, <hi>the Man</hi> you deſcribe
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:006010_0062_1027725F51474378"/>
is <hi>under the Dominion of Sin.</hi> Now ſuch a one, ſays the Scripture, <hi>cannot pleaſe God.</hi>—Agreeably we are told, Heb. 11. 6. <hi>Without faith, it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> None, I think, can doubt of its being <hi>Faith unfeigned,</hi> ſuch as is a <hi>believing with the Heart unto Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> that is here intended: Nor can it be doubted whether all that are <hi>under the Dominion of Sin,</hi> are utterly deſtitute of this <hi>Faith</hi>; without which 'tis <hi>impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi>—I might alſo produce here thoſe Sayings and Reaſonings of our Saviour, in Mat. 7. 17, 18. and in <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. 33, 34, 35. and in <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 12. So <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 12. with many other Texts might be cited, that clearly hold forth the Truth I am upon.—And I am perſuaded, that the <hi>Senſe</hi> I take theſe Scriptures in, agreeable to my Purpoſe, has the approving Suffrage of all <hi>Proteſtant Churches</hi> in their publick Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Faith; not excepting even the <hi>Formulas</hi> of your own Church, as before obſerv'd. And here I could readily turn you to many Paſſages, full to my Deſign, in your <hi>Articles,</hi> and <hi>Homilies,</hi> if not your <hi>Liturgy</hi> too. But for Brevity I omit it at preſent.—And now, Sir, if the Reverend <hi>Compilers</hi> of your own publick Standards, with other eminent <hi>Reformers,</hi> agreed to that Conſtruction of the ſacred Text, which our <hi>Author,</hi> whom you oppoſe, has eſpouſed, I pray, conſider WHOM your <hi>Reflections</hi> upon him and thoſe on his Side of the Queſtion, are equally applicable to. Do you indeed, Sir, think that theſe excellent Divines all built on <hi>empty Cobwebs,</hi>—tortur'd the plaineſt Texts,— &amp;c. to favour a <hi>preconceiv'd humane</hi> Scheme, <hi>not founded</hi> on the holy Scriptures, wherein it was <hi>peculiar,</hi> i.e <hi>ſo far</hi> as it agreed not with the Scheme of thoſe on <hi>your</hi> Side in this Controverſy!—</p>
            <p>But I return from this Digreſſion, and go on with the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.—How is it poſſible, Sir, that the Unregenerate Man's <hi>Doings</hi> ſhould be <hi>pleaſing</hi> to God, ſo long as his <hi>Perſon,</hi> as under the Dominion and Guilt of Sin, is both odious to the Divine Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, after obnoxious to revenging Juſtice? Or how is it poſſible, ſince he is not vitally and ſavingly <hi>united to Chriſt,</hi> and ſo not actually intereſted in the Merits of the <hi>Mediator,</hi> by whom only we have <hi>Acceſs to the Father,</hi> that any of the Sinner's Doings ſhould te pleaſing to God? For, are we not <hi>accepted in the Beloved</hi>? And are not the very Saint's <hi>ſpiritual Sacrifices</hi> only <hi>acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt</hi>? How then can you imagine the <hi>Unregenerate</hi> Man's Doings acceptable, while he does not <hi>come to God by the Mediator,</hi> nor has him an <hi>Advocate</hi> for him with the Father? And if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the infinite <hi>Contrariety</hi> there is between the <hi>Purity</hi> of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, and the <hi>polluted Doings</hi> of the moſt refin'd Creature
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:006010_0063_10277261214AE360"/>
               <hi>under Sin's Dominion,</hi> how can you conceive it poſſible, that any the beſt Endeavours of ſuch a Creature ſhould be pleaſing to God? How can he be ſuppoſed, in any fair Conſiſtence with his unſpotted Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to act in Character of a <hi>moral Governor and Righteous Judge of the Behaviour of his Creature,</hi> even while anſwering Sinners <hi>Cries for</hi> Mercy, ſince their very beſt Devotions, as void of all true <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>godly Sincerity,</hi> muſt needs appear, at the Bottom, but <hi>ſelfiſh, carnal</hi> and <hi>impure</hi> in his Sight?—Whatever Aids of the <hi>Holy Sprit</hi> ſuch may experience, yet while under the <hi>Dominion of Sin</hi> it is impoſſible in the Nature of Things, that ſuch with all the Help of Divine <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Grace</hi> ſhould be able to pleaſe God in the Manner of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming any Duty.—Nor can it be pleaded, that however ſinful and unworthy the Performances of ſuch are <hi>in themſelves,</hi> yet God may accept them <hi>for Chriſt's ſake.</hi> No; for, notwithſtanding the Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's Merits and Purchaſe, there is a wife Scheme or Method provided for the <hi>Application</hi> of Redeeming Grace: and according to the Scripture-Account of this, there's ſuch a <hi>Connection</hi> establiſh'd here between the <hi>Sanctification of the Spirit</hi> and the <hi>Sprinkling if the Blood of Jeſus,</hi> as that the Latter never takes Place on any Soul without the Former. So that only <hi>Saints in Chriſt Jeſus</hi> indeed have true Communion with God and Acceptance in his Sight. Nor can any <hi>under the Dominion and Guilt of Sin,</hi> (which you grant to be the Caſe of all the <hi>Unregenerate</hi>) hope to make their Way into the Favour of God by any poſſible Services of theirs (whilſt in that Situation) notwithſtanding they may profeſſedly implore Acceptance <hi>for Chriſt's Sake.</hi> Without a divine <hi>Application</hi> of Redemption in Effectual Calling, the Sinner's meer pleading its Purchaſe will avail nothing towards gaining the Divine Acceptance and Favour. In vain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the meer Purchaſe ſuppos'd to be the Ground of a <hi>Promiſe</hi> to Men's Endeavours antecedent to this equally neceſſary <hi>Application.</hi> I have the rather (<hi>Sir</hi>) inſiſted on theſe Things here, becauſe many in your Scheme appear to me exceedingly confus'd in their Tho'ts upon them, without any conſiſtent Scheme of Principles, and indeed without) any diſtinct Idea's at all upon theſe Particulars: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Importance of the Things in themſelves, as well as their Reference to the Point <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> in Debate.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only add here, that the <hi>ſtriving</hi> Sinner, whoſe <hi>Right</hi> (at leaſt <hi>conditional Right</hi>) to ſpecial Grace, paſſed over to him by God's Promiſe, you contend for, <hi>this Man</hi> (I ſay) is either <hi>under the Law,</hi> or <hi>under Grace</hi>; I mean, as to his ſecret State before God, he is now actually either in the Covenant of the <hi>firſt Adam,</hi> or in the Covenant of the <hi>ſecond Adam.</hi> He can't be in <hi>Both</hi> at the ſame

Time: or be <hi>of Works,</hi> and <hi>of Faith</hi> too, Now, if the former be his Caſe, the Scripture tells us, he is <hi>under the Curſe.</hi> (Gal. 3. 10.) And how the Man that is <hi>under the Curſe of the Law,</hi> or (as you grant) <hi>under the Dominion and Guilt of Sin,</hi> ſhould at the ſame Time have a <hi>Right</hi> to Salvation, or (which is the ſame Thing) to God's <hi>ſpecial Grace,</hi> by Virtue of a Promiſe in the <hi>Goſpel Covenant,</hi> muſt to my weak Underſtanding remain a <hi>Paradox,</hi> till you can favour me with ſome ſatisfactory Solution of the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. And till you have done this, I hope you'l no more upbraid thoſe on our Side with "<hi>corrupting the Plainneſs and Simplicity of the Goſpel</hi> and in Effect making it a meer <hi>unintelligible Riddle</hi>"— How is it poſſible, Sir, that Sinners actually in a <hi>State,</hi> and under a <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,</hi> condemn'd both by <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Goſpel,</hi> ſhould be capable of pleaſing God with their <hi>dead Formalities</hi>; or be <hi>made accepted in the Beloved,</hi> while they are far from <hi>preſenting their Bodies a living Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, holy and acceptable to God, which is our reaſonable Service</hi>!</p>
            <p>From all thoſe Conſiderations, I think it inconteſtible, that there's be Probability, no Poſſibility of the Unregenerate Man's Endeavours in Religion (whilſt his State and his governing Principle are ſuch) Being in any ſound Scriptural Senſe <hi>pleaſing to God.</hi>—And then, to be ſure, theſe his Endeavours cannot conſiſtently be pretended to be the <hi>Condition</hi> of promiſed <hi>ſpecial Grace,</hi> which the Bleſſed God in Quality of a <hi>moral Governor and righteous Judge of his Creature's Behaviour and Improvements,</hi> ſtands engaged by his Covenant to beſtow in Reward of the Sinner's Endeavours.</p>
            <p>But ſo much for the firſt Thing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nor am I able to conceive how it's poſſible, that any Doings which are <hi>diſpleaſing</hi> and <hi>offenſive</hi> to God, (as for the Principles, the Ends, and Manner of them, are the beſt Doings of every Unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate Man) ſhould, eſpecially under that Notion be the ſtated <hi>Condition</hi> of his obtaining ſpecial Grace, or give him a <hi>Right</hi> to it in Virtue of any <hi>Promiſe</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>Surely this muſt to every unprejudic'd Thinker appear a deep Abſurdity, or in your own Language, <hi>perfect Nonſenſe.</hi> Doubtleſs it will be granted me, there is a Divine <hi>Harmony</hi> and moral <hi>Fitneſs</hi> in the whole Conſtitution of the Goſpel-Covenant, and a perfect Congruity or Suitableneſs to the <hi>moral Perfections</hi> of God running through his whole Adminiſtration of it. But what Shadow of Agreement between the <hi>Behaviour and Improvements</hi> of a fallen Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture actually <hi>under the Dominion and Guilt of Sin,</hi> contrary to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, therefore odious in the Sight of God,—And God's making theſe a <hi>Condiition</hi> in the Goſpel-Covenant, upon which he
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:006010_0065_1027726AE4CBCCC0"/>
has ſuſpended his <hi>Promiſe</hi> of ſpecial Grace, and which accordingly as a moral Governor and righteous Judge, he makes the <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Meaſure</hi> of his Diſpenſations in the preſent Caſe ? Are there not ſome of the moſt <hi>Inconſiſtent</hi> Ideas put together here!—Can the polluted Doings of a Creature, devoid of the Image of God and under the Power of Sin, have any <hi>Virtue</hi> in them to recommend him to God's Favour, and to make him a meet Object of his <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace,</hi> or in your own Phraſe, to <hi>qualify him for God's Help</hi>? And if not, then I pray, what is there in theſe Doings, to render it at all congruous, or ſuitable that they ſhould be made the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> in a Divine <hi>Promiſe,</hi> and ſo in Virtue of <hi>this</hi> ſerve to give the fallen Creature a <hi>Right</hi> to ſpecial and ſaving Grace! Can you poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly conceive, how it ſhould bear any <hi>Agreement</hi> with the rectoral <hi>Holineſs</hi> of God, in tranſacting with his Creatures, to make That a <hi>Condition</hi> of his ſpecial Grace, which (though materially <hi>good,</hi> yet otterwiſe) in its whole moral Complexion, is infinitely <hi>diſagreeable,</hi> and therefore <hi>diſpleaſing,</hi> to the Divine Purity?

            </p>
            <p>Nor will it (as ſome in your Scheme argue againſt us) do any Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the <hi>Mercy</hi> of God, to ſuppoſe ſuch a <hi>Promiſe</hi> as you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for: becauſe his Name is <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>True,</hi> as well as <hi>Merciful</hi> and <hi>Gracious.</hi> And in his Covenant of <hi>Mercy,</hi> and in all the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of <hi>Covenant-Mercy,</hi> He ſtill preſerves his <hi>Truth</hi> inviolable and his <hi>Holineſs</hi> perfectly unblemiſhed. To deny a Divine Promiſe to any <hi>Condition,</hi> that is contrary to his <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> and to deny his being <hi>pleaſed</hi> with any Doings of a Creature <hi>under the Dominion of Sin,</hi> and which have no Degree of true moral Purity in them, is ſo far from leſſening the Honour of Divine <hi>Mercy,</hi> that it is a Vindication of it.

His Promiſes of <hi>Mercy,</hi> and all his Actings upon them, never fail of being intirely conſiſtent with and honorary to all the moral Attributes of his Nature.—And here, Sir, I would join with you (in your <hi>Pag.</hi> 20.) in "Wiſhing it to be more ſeriouſly conſider'd, that it was the <hi>Wicked Servant</hi> (<hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 24. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 22.) who repreſented his <hi>Lord</hi> as an <hi>hard Man, reaping where he had never ſown,</hi>" &amp;c.

way of thinking in Religion, and more eſpecially to the Want of a full and juſt Senſe of the <hi>Sinfulneſs</hi> and <hi>Miſery</hi> of that Eſtate, into which the Fall brought Mankind.</p>
            <p>But, it may be, after all I have ſaid to enforce the Argument in hand, ſome may attempt to weaken it by <hi>denying</hi> the <hi>Disjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; and pretending, <hi>That the Endeavours if the</hi> ſeeking ſtriving <hi>Sinner, to which they ſuppoſe</hi> ſpecial Grace <hi>promiſed, are ſuch a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now the Weakneſs of ſuch a Pretence will eaſily appear, if we conſider, that it is in the Nature of Things impoſſible, the Doings of a <hi>moral Agent,</hi> in a <hi>moral Caſe,</hi> and conſidered <hi>as ſuch</hi> by <hi>a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Governor</hi> and <hi>righteous Judge,</hi> ſhould be neither <hi>good</hi> nor <hi>evil,</hi> and ſo neither <hi>pleaſing</hi> nor <hi>diſpleaſing</hi> to Him.—The Lord <hi>weigheth Actions,</hi> and <hi>loveth Righteouſneſs,</hi> but <hi>hateth Iniquity.</hi> And conſidering fallen Man as ſtill a Subject of moral Government under a Law to God, and obliged by natural Bonds as a Creature to glorify Him in Body and Spirit, which are His; how is it poſſible, that any of his voluntary Actions ſhould be totally indifferent, ſo as not to carry in them <hi>moral Godneſs,</hi> nor yet <hi>moral Evil.</hi> Such an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute <hi>Neutrality</hi> is what this Caſe will never admit of. And now according as they are truly <hi>Works of Righteouſneſs,</hi> or not, ſo does God as a moral Governor and Judge either <hi>approve,</hi> or elſe <hi>diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove</hi> them.—The <hi>Disjunction</hi> then in the Caſe before us muſt forever ſtand: and the Pretence of any Doings, preſcribbed as <hi>Conditions</hi> to a <hi>moral</hi> Agent, being neither good nor evil, neither pleaſing nor diſpleaſing to a moral Governor, muſt be diſcarded as a vain and idle Pretence.—Admitting it were a poſſible Caſe, that the Doings of a <hi>moral Agent,</hi> acting as ſuch, might be perfectly indifferent <hi>in themſelves,</hi> yet if we ſuppoſe them by a <hi>moral Governor</hi> made the <hi>Conditions</hi> of a promiſed Benefit, they muſt in this View <hi>loſe</hi> their Indifferency; and being looked on as <hi>good,</hi> will conſequently be <hi>amiable</hi> and <hi>pleaſing</hi> in his Sight.—However, if the Doings of the Unregenerate Man be indeed, (according to the Objection) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>pleaſing</hi> nor yet <hi>diſpleaſing</hi> to God, then ſurely they muſt ſtand for meer <hi>Cyphers,</hi> moral <hi>Nullities,</hi> in God's Account: and it muſt diſcover too little Reverence of the only wiſe God, to ſuppoſe Him, as a <hi>moral Governor,</hi> in a Covenant-Tranſaction with his fallen Creature making a very <hi>Thing of Nought</hi> the <hi>Condition</hi> of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Grace, and the <hi>Rule</hi> of his Adminiſtration as a <hi>righteous Judge</hi> of the Behaviour of <hi>moral</hi> Agents.—Can ſuch Doings, as morally are <hi>Nothing,</hi> be ſuppoſ'd a <hi>fit Conſideration</hi> for the Majeſty of Heaven

Such Doings as are upon this Hypotheſis indeed but <hi>empty Cobwebs,</hi> can you ſuppoſe it conſiſtent with Wiſdom, that theſe ſhould be (what thoſe in your Scheme make the Unregenerate Man's Doings) <hi>the Conſideration</hi> which God reſpects in diſpenſing his <hi>Grace,</hi> the immediate <hi>Baſis</hi> of the Application of Redemption, the <hi>Ground</hi> of Effectual Calling and ſo of actual Salvation! Has ſuch a pretended Condition any <hi>Meetneſs</hi> to be, as it is made, the grand Hinge, on which a ſaving Intereſt in the Redeemer turns, and on which the Promiſe of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace is ſuſpended!—Yet I muſt needs ſay, as abſurd as the Suppoſition is, which we are upon, is ſeems leſs diſhonourable to God, than either of thoſe in the <hi>Disjunction,</hi> which it is brought to confute. For, to ſuppoſe the Unregenerate Man's Doings, though not morally good, yet <hi>pleaſing</hi> to God, and in this View made the Condition of his Promiſe in the Caſe before us; or to ſuppoſe them, although diſpleaſing to God, as being morally not good, yet however made <hi>conditional</hi> of the Beſtowment of his <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace</hi>; either of theſe appears rather <hi>worſe,</hi> I think, than to ſuppoſe a perfect <hi>Neutrality</hi> here, and that they are under <hi>neither</hi> of theſe Views made the <hi>Condition,</hi> in a free Promiſe and ſovereign Act of Grace. Nevertheleſs, all theſe Suppoſitions are really abſurd, and reflect on the moral Perfections of God, that none of them are to be admitted. And whatever View theſe <hi>Works</hi> ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to Converſion are conſidered in, they can no ways with any Suitableneſs to the Nature of Things, or to the revealed Scheme of Salvation, have this <hi>Conditional</hi> Form put upon them: and I believe, an Appeal might ſafely be made here to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Generality, at leaſt of the moſt experienced Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Divines.</p>
            <p>Here, Sir, I muſt ſeriouſly profeſs my ſelf intirely at a Loſs how to reconcile the Scheme you are upon, either with the <hi>Humility</hi> of ſaving <hi>Faith,</hi> or indeed with the foregoing <hi>Humiliation,</hi> proper to the Caſe of an <hi>awakened ſeeking Sinner,</hi> that is to ſay, if the Principles of your Letter are thoroughly received, conſciouſly acted upon, and fully purſued in all their practical Conſequences.

<pb n="71" facs="unknown:006010_0069_1027727556310F90"/>
Indeed, Sir, I cannot ſee how to reconcile your <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> with the Body of your <hi>Letter,</hi> in this Point. You ſay, You don't <hi>aim at</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining the <hi>humbling</hi> Doctrines of the Goſpel: and yet it is the main Deſign and Drift of your whole Letter to <hi>undermine</hi> that Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine touching God's <hi>Sovereignty</hi> in Converſion, which only is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated for the End of effectually <hi>humbling</hi> the loſt Sinner; and you ſet your ſelf to ſupport that Doctrine of a <hi>Promiſe</hi> of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace, to the Unregenerate, on <hi>Condition</hi> of their own Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, which ſo ſtrongly tends to ſlatter the <hi>Pride</hi> of the fallen Creature, and to countenance that <hi>Boaſting</hi> which the Goſpel for ever <hi>excludes.</hi> You ſeem loath to ſpeak out plainly the whole Truth concerning the Guilt, Pollution and Wretchedneſs of the Sinner's natural State; you appear loath, that fallen Man ſhould be repreſented in ſuch improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd and diſtreſs'd Circumſtances, as to be oblig'd to come (<hi>Form Pauperis</hi>) in the humble Poſture ard Spirit of a <hi>Beggar,</hi> to ſue for divine Alms, <hi>without Money and without Price</hi>; but you would bolſter him up with the Notion of a <hi>Right,</hi> at leaſt a <hi>conditional Right,</hi> paſſed over to him by a divine <hi>Premiſe,</hi> made to his Cries and Endeavours, and ſecuring to him Succeſs; and not leaving the ſovereign God at abſolute <hi>Liberty,</hi> either to give or to with-hold as he pleaſeth. Nay, upon a Suppoſition that God hath reſerv'd ſuch a <hi>Liberty</hi> to himſelf, and not bound himſelf by expreſs <hi>Promiſe,</hi> to diſpenſe his Grace to the Rebel-Creature, upon Condition of his own <hi>Endeavours,</hi> you inſinuate as if in that caſe God would act like a <hi>hard Maſter,</hi> &amp;c. even notwithſtanding all the condeſcending Invitations and gracious Encouragements which the Goſpel abounds with, to the returning Sinner.—Now, ſurely if this be the Spirit of your Letter, I muſt needs ſay, it looks ſo very much like aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to undermine <hi>the Soul humbling Doctrines of the Goſpel,</hi> that I ſhould have verily thought you had really <hi>aim'd</hi> at this, if you had not profeſſed otherwiſe. And if others judge your ſolemn Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſufficient Force to remove that Imputation, I muſt leave it: Only I will here remind you of Bp. <hi>Hopkins</hi>'s Cenſure upon your Scheme, <hi>viz.</hi> That to <hi>ſuppoſe Grace given according to Works is the Sum and Upſhot of</hi> Pelagianiſm.</p>

For all that exceeds what is <hi>juſt ſufficient</hi> to render Being <hi>deſirable,</hi> is more than his Perfections oblige him to, even in that Caſe, and muſt ſpring from meer <hi>arbitrary</hi> Kindneſs.

If ſo, then I think, it follows, 'tis your Opinion, That <hi>Adam</hi>'s Offspring are born <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>innocent</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.

Was it not therefore an Act of <hi>ſovereign Godneſs</hi> in Him to provide a Saviour, to raiſe up a ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> when we were ruin'd in the First?

            <p>Sir, to return to the main Point immediately m Debate between us, I would propoſe to you two Inquiries. (1.) Does not the <hi>Right</hi> to ſpecial Grace, which you plead for, as by a Divine <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> paſſed over to the <hi>ſtriving Sinner,</hi> does not this (I ſay) neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily imply an actual <hi>Agreement</hi> or <hi>Reconciliation</hi> between an offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God and his Rebel-Creature? Does it not evidently ſuppoſe, that the Lord is actually become <hi>this Man's</hi> reconciled <hi>Covenant-God,</hi> and oblig'd by his Juſtice and Veracity to bleſs him with all ſpiritual Bleſſings?—For it would be abſurd, to aſſert a <hi>Right</hi> on the Sinner's part, with an <hi>Obligation</hi> on God's part, both by Virtue of a <hi>Promiſe</hi> of Grace, and yet at the ſame time to ſuppoſe no Agreement or Peace at all between the Parties?—And then (2.) I ask, whether it be poſſible, that there ſhould be this <hi>Reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> or <hi>Agreement</hi> between theſe extream <hi>Oppoſites</hi> in Nature (i. e. whilſt remaining ſuch) a God of infinite <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and a Creature <hi>under the Dominion and Guilt of Sin</hi>? Pleaſe, Sir, to turn to thoſe Divine Declarations to the Purpoſe, in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6 14, 15. and I <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 6. Compar'd with <hi>Amos</hi> 3. 3. When you have maturely conſider'd theſe two Inquiries pleaſe to give me the Reſult of
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:006010_0072_102772821D419020"/>
your Thoughts, and it may contribute to an eaſy Iſſue of this Debate.</p>
            <p>I beg Leave, Sir, before I finiſh, to offer ſome Hints on a <hi>Text,</hi> you have preſs'd into your Service, which has hitherto eſcaped my Notice. In the <hi>Advertiſement</hi> before your Letter you allude to this Paſſage, in <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 12, 13. <hi>Work out your own Salvation with Fear and Trembling: for it is God which worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good Pleaſure.</hi> It were in effect charging yon with Impertinence, not to ſuppoſe that you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood theſe Words as importing a <hi>Promiſe</hi> of <hi>ſpecial Grace,</hi> made to the Endeavours of Unregenerate Men under the Dominion and Guilt of Sin. Yet indeed there is not the leaſt Colour for ſuch a Conſtruction of the Words, neither from the Text not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text. There is a total Silence here, as to the Caſe of an <hi>Unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate</hi> Man.—So there is with regard to the Sinner's <hi>working</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>conditional</hi> of God's <hi>working.</hi> Nay, the Contrary appears, in as much as <hi>God's</hi> working is here conſidered as <hi>prior</hi> to Man's working, and (as ſuch) urged as a <hi>Motive</hi> to it.—Neither is there any Mention made here of <hi>converting Grace,</hi> nor muſt we neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily conceive <hi>firſt Grace</hi> to be intended here by the <hi>Salvation</hi> ſpoken of: but it may as properly mean <hi>progreſſive</hi> Salvation here, and <hi>compleat</hi> Salvation hereafter: in which Views the Word is often uſed, and is ſo in this Epiſtle. (Chap. 1. 19, 28.)—Nor is the <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Trembling,</hi> here mentioned, ſuch as is common to the Unregenerate, but may as well, and doubtleſs doth, intend a <hi>filial</hi> Reverence and <hi>godly</hi> Fear, peculiar to true Chriſtians. — And the Exhortation here is expreſly directed to thoſe whom the Apoſtle calls <hi>his Beloved,</hi> and of whom he ſays they had <hi>always obeyed.</hi> A ſure Sign, he did not here addreſs ſuch as he ſuppoſed to be <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate.</hi>—And the Argument he uſes to enforce it, is, <hi>For it is God that worketh in you,</hi> &amp;c. Which runs not directly in the Form of <hi>a Promiſe,</hi> but ſeems only a Declaration of Fact: <hi>q. d.</hi> It is the Deſign of God's <hi>working in you,</hi> as he has done, and the proper Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you ſhould make of <hi>Grace received,</hi> is, to put you upon Endeavours after progreſſive Sanctification, and taking Pains for the <hi>Furtherance of your Salvation.</hi>—Yet the Words may implicitly couch in them a <hi>Promiſe,</hi> but it is to <hi>Saints in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>—Nor would I be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood here to deny, that this Text may ſeveral Ways be adapted and apply'd for Excitation and Encouragement to the <hi>ſeeking ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Sinner,</hi> and eſpecially for the promoting his <hi>Humiliation,</hi> by a Conviction of his own ſpiritual Impotence, and the Sovereignty
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:006010_0073_102772851020B920"/>
of God in the Operations of efficacious Grace, &amp;c However, Sir, this is no Help to your Argument.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now take a brief Notice of what you have advanced in your <hi>Letter</hi> (Pag. 3.) where you tell us, <q>
                  <hi>Nothing can ſo effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually tend to cut the Sinews of all</hi> Endeavours <hi>to repent,—as even the moſt diſtant</hi> Surmiſe, <hi>that poſſibly all our Labour may be in</hi> vain.</q>—This, Sir, is to my beſt Underſtanding one of the moſt palpable Miſtakes. And if applied to any important Buſineſs in humane Life, will be found contrary to plain Fact, in our daily Experience and Obſervation. Doth not the Husbandman <hi>plow in Hope,</hi> without the leaſt Certainty of Succeſs? Doth not the Mariner ſail in dangerous Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Year, and in Times of War? Doth not the Merchant ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture his Subſtance acroſs the Sea to foreign Countries, even when <hi>Sailing is dangerous</hi>? And do theſe Men act without any the moſt diſtant <hi>Surmiſe</hi> of the Poſſibility of Diſappointments in their Affairs? Or in Caſe of Sickneſs, won't Men ſend for the <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> and <hi>uſe many Medicines,</hi> notwithſtanding apparent Hazard of never recovering? How unjuſtifiabie then muſt be the Conduct of Sinners, if in a Caſe of infinitely greater Importance, and of eternal Conſequence, they ſuffer any <hi>diſtant Surmiſe of all their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours being in vain,</hi> to <hi>cut the Sinews of their Endeavours</hi>! Ought they not in this moſt momentous Caſe, if they would <hi>ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Men</hi> and conſiſtent Agents, to act upon like Encouragement, as in Matters of inferior Concernment? It being a Caſe, in which any the leaſt <hi>Probability,</hi> yea, a bare <hi>Poſſibility</hi> of Succeſs is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more valuable, than in any other Caſe imaginable; and a Caſe, where <hi>Neceſſity</hi> calls aloud for their moſt ardent Deſires, their moſt inceſſant <hi>Strivings to enter in at the ſtrait Gate,</hi> their utmoſt Pains in <hi>preſſing into the Kingdom of God.</hi>— Was the <hi>Man-ſlayer</hi> under the Law ſure of Succeſs, and yet was he not wont to free with all his Might to the City of Refuge? And ſhould not the awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened Sinner, though wuhout a Promiſe of certain Succeſs, yet upon the Encouragement of a <hi>Probability,</hi> or even a meer <hi>Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, flee for Refuge to lay Hold on the Hope ſet before Him</hi>?—Did not the <hi>Ninevites</hi> act meerly upon the Encouragement of a <hi>Who can tell if God will return</hi>!—And the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> were they not Stimulated by an uncertain Hope, ſaying, <hi>Who knoweth if God will repent, and leave a Bleſſing behind him</hi>!—Once more, when an inſpired Apoſtle had an hypocritical Profeſſor of the Goſpel in Dealing, I mean <hi>Simon,</hi> whom he perceived to be in the Gall of Bitterneſs and Bond of Iniquity, with what Encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement doth he enforce his Exhortation to him to <hi>repent,</hi> and <hi>pray to God</hi>?

The Apoſtle only mentions a <hi>Perhaps</hi>; and never liſp to him the moſt diſtant Surmiſe of a <hi>Promiſe</hi> to ſecure certain Succeſs. Now in this, will you ſay of in Inſpired Apoſtle, that he took the ready Method <hi>to cut the Sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> of</hi> Simon's <hi>Endeavours to repent</hi>!—I hope ſurely, in this Caſe you will ſay No — What then is the <hi>Divinity</hi> you teach, in this Particular! Is it not too near akin to that <hi>vain Philoſophy,</hi> you ſo loudly exclaim againſt? Or, is not the Language of your Objection in this Caſe, too agreeable to that of the <hi>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ful Man,</hi> who in Excuſe of his Averſion to taking any Pains without Certainty of Succeſs, ſays on every Occaſion, <hi>There is e Lion in the Way!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, Sir, however thoſe on your Side of the Queſtion may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue any Goſpel-Encouragement, ſhort of a <hi>Promiſe</hi> aſcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Succeſs of a Sinner's Endeavours; Yet we on the other hand are conſtrained, in the View of the glorious Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Goſpel (though from meer Sovereign Mercy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſed to any Endeavours of the Unregenerate) to admire the Wiſdom of God in the Conſtitution of the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> ſo adapted to the Deſign of exalting his own <hi>Sovereignty,</hi> and ſecuring the Honours of his <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Holineſs</hi> together, and ſo adapted to promote at the ſame Time both the <hi>Humiliation</hi> and the <hi>Encouragement</hi> of the fallen Creature: Equally calculated to awaken the Sinner's Fear of God's Wrath, and to ſupport a Hope in his Mercy, ſo, to guard him againſt the Dangers of Security, Preſumption, and Delay, on the one hand, and on the other againſt all Temptations to Deſpair and Dejection.</p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, I have finiſhed what I propoſed on this Occaſion.—I am conſcious of much Infirmity, and ask your Candour. I think, I can ſay uprightly, I have not committed any wilful Miſtakes: but have wrote in the Fear of God, the very Senſe of my Heart, according to my beſt Light.</p>
            <p>On the whole, I would juſt make the one Remark, and be it remember'd: Though I deny any <hi>Pormiſe,</hi> by virtue of which
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:006010_0075_1027728D772848F8"/>
the <hi>ſpecial Grace</hi> of God can poſſibly become <hi>due</hi> to the Prayers and Endeavours of the Unregenerate, whilſt ſuch; Yet however, in I am perſwaded, that it is the Duty of Sinners to be ſeeking and ſtriving after it; and that not a ſingle Inſtance will be found of any Sinner in the Day of Judgment able to ſtand forth, and plead in Truth, <hi>Lord, I did my beſt Endeavour to the very laſt, that I might obtain the Salvation which is by Jeſus Chriſt, and looked diligently lest I should fall of the Grace of God but after all was deny'd</hi>— To be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of this <hi>Fact</hi> on the Score of the Riches of God's Mercy, and yet at the ſame Time to renounce all Pretence of a <hi>Promiſe</hi> to the Sinner's Endeavours, appear to me Things very well conſiſtent. Though, guided by the Word, I limit the <hi>Promiſes</hi> of God to the Believer: Yet far be it from me, to entertain a Thought of limiting Him in his <hi>unpromiſed Mercy</hi> towards Sinners, whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>May the Spirit of Truth leads us into all Truth; and may the Spirit of Grace make all Grace to abound towards us and in as!</p>
