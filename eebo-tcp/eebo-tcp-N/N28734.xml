            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THESE are the words of a mourner, who lamented the death of one not allied to him by the ties of blood; but a man of ſhining talents and diſtinguiſhed abilities, whoſe ſervices were greatly needed at that time.</p>
            <p>The mourner was David, King of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. The perſon whoſe fall he lamented was Abner an offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of the firſt rank.</p>
            <p>This Abner was captain of the hoſt, he had been general of Saul's army, was near the pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap> of the King and poſſeſſed a large ſhare of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and favor.</p>
            <p>He was faithful to king Saul, during his reign,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:038307_0004_10119E3E4ADEF198"/>
and zealouſly ſupported the intereſt of his family after his deceaſe.</p>
            <p>This man was not only in high favor with the King; but with the people <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he had a large ſhare of their confidence.</p>
            <p>Some may think, perhaps, that Abner's forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Iſhboſheth, Saul's ſon, and throwing his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence into the ſcale of his rival, is a blot in his character. But Abner might find Iſhboſheth to be a haughty, jealous, if not an effeminate prince, and unfit to govern a kingdom, and for this reaſon, as alſo to ſave the blood of his country by uniting the contending parties, uſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> his influence to eſtabliſh the regal dignity in the hands of David.</p>
            <p>But if this was any blemiſh in his character, the royal mourner did not take notice of it, or view it in that light.</p>
            <p>But this I ſhall leave, and attend to the eulogium in the text, a prince and a great man.</p>
            <p>His being called a prince ſeems to import that Abner was the chief, or head of a family in the tribe. This was a title of honor given to the head of the tribes of Iſrael: they were princes of the congregation.</p>
            <p>It ſeems to have been an ancient as well as mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern cuſtom to give men in public offices an honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary title; ſuch as was attached to their office.</p>
            <p>But titles of honor are not always connected with a true greatneſs of character. King David ſeems
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:038307_0005_10119E40B70C9B08"/>
to have been aware of this, and therefore mentions Abner, not only as an honorable perſonage, but as a great man.</p>
            <p>It was the greatneſs of this man's character, which made him to be ſo much lamented. He was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of talents which were of importance to the State, and ſuch as were wanted at that time.</p>
            <p>There was no man ſo well calculated to unite the tribes of Iſrael, at that time divided, as was Abner. He was not only in high favor with David; but he had ſuch influence with the tribes of Iſrael, as to be able to incline them to any party, and engage them to ſupport any intereſt he might be diſpoſed to favor.</p>
            <p>With great eaſe he drew the ten tribes into his views of ſupporting David whom God had choſen, and anointed to be King over his people. His in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence with the people was ſo great, as to bow the hearts of all ranks to the houſe of David, which happily terminated a conteſt for the regal dignity, that was dangerous to the State. Thus the twelve tribes were united and became one band, invincible, to their enemies.</p>
            <p>Thus the hands of David were ſtrengthened, and he was eſtabliſhed in the kingdom.</p>
            <p>So much influence in a ſubject may be thought dangerous to the State: and influence ſo extenſive, employed againſt government, would throw all things into confuſion, and might ruin a nation. But when ſuperior talents added to influence ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive as was Abner's, are directed by a generous,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:038307_0006_10119E42452BE210"/>
patriotiſm, and employed for the ſupport of gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, the moſt pleaſing and happy effects are to be expected.</p>
            <p>The active genius and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> talents of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, were what made him appear great in the eyes of David.</p>
            <p>When we conſider the character of David, that he was a man of virtue, of an honeſt mind, yea, "a man after God's own heart," we are conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to believe he ſpoke what he thought was truth, when he announced Abner to have been a great man.</p>
            <p>David was a man of too nice a ſenſe of honor, and had too great a regard to truth, to aſcribe a greatneſs of character to a man whom he did not think worthy of it.</p>
            <p>King David knew Abner: he had accompanied him in former wars—had been an eye witneſs of his conduct in the exalted rank of Captain of the hoſt, or General of the army—he had ſeen that he behaved himſelf wiſely—that his plans were form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with judgment and executed with diſpatch, that he was reſolute and perſevering in accompliſhing whatever he undertook, and was equal to the moſt important enterpriſes, he was therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that Abner merited the eulogy in the text.</p>
            <p>Abner having attached himſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the intereſt of David, the latter had no doubt raiſed expectations from his abilities and influence. He had reaſon to expect in that man a firm friend, and an able ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter of his government—that by his exertion
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:038307_0007_10119E45E21BA8B0"/>
his (David's) intereſt, which might have appeared doubtful, would be much ſtrengthened.</p>
            <p>The addreſs and talents of Abner, were of ſignal advantage to the Kings. By the prudent counſels, the engaging manners, and convincing argument of the former, the tribes of Iſrael had been won over to the intereſt of the latter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they had been made willing to acknowledge David to be their lawful King, and to follow his fortune.</p>
            <p>Altho' Abner did not live to finiſh his great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of eſtabliſhing the kingdom in the hands of David; yet, the foundation was laid ſo ſtrong, that the ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> took place after his deceaſe. The impreſſion made on their minds by this influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial man, continued to direct the conduct of Iſrael after his death; and the happy effect of his exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, were experienced by the King, when Abner was no more.</p>
            <p>Theſe were no doubt among the conſiderations which gave riſe to the mourning recorded in the text and context.</p>
            <p>Whatever ſervices this man had rendered the King, and whatever he might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ect from his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture exertions, his hopes were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> off by his death.</p>
            <p>The King wept at his grave, he lamented his fall, and, to do juſtice to his memory, pronounced him "a great man."</p>
            <p>Mourning is decent and proper, when not indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to exceſs. It is no mark of a weak mind, it betrays no want of religion. On the other hand,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:038307_0008_10119E49452EC070"/>
it diſcovers a ſenſe of the dignity of human nature, and the diſhonor done to man in the grave.</p>
            <p>Mourning is a tribute due to the memory of the deceaſed, eſpecially to illuſtrious characters.</p>
            <p>It is proper to keep in mind their amiable virtues—to call into view the ſhining traits in their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and to make mention of their worthy deeds. This is doing them juſtice, it is a tribute we owe them. This juſtice was done to Abner, this tribute was paid to his memory in the words of the text, "a great man is fallen."</p>
            <p>That ſuch honor is due to the memory of the dead, ſeems to be the ſenſe of mankind. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed upon the minds of people of all ranks.</p>
            <p>When David lamented the fall of his predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, and his ſon, he did it in terms which expreſſed whatever was praiſe-worthy in them. "Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleaſant in their lives, they were ſwifter than eagles, they were ſtronger than lions." "Ye daughters of Iſrael, weep over Saul, who clothed you in ſcarlet, with other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel."</p>
            <p>When the good Hezekiah, King of Judah, kept with his fathers, it is ſaid, that "they buried him in the chiefeſt of the ſepulchers of the ſons of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem did him honor at his death." They gave him an honorable burial, and lamented his fall with to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of grief for the loſs of ſo good a King.</p>
            <p>Death in any form, cauſes mourning. Whoever
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:038307_0009_10119E4AD0078FB8"/>
the victim may be, it ſpreads a gloom upon the countenances of beholders.</p>
            <p>We are not totally indifferent to the fall of any of our fellow creatures. Tho' <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nconnected by the ties of blood or kindred, or the bonds of ſociety, their death makes a melancholly impreſſion.</p>
            <p>Death is a ſtanding token of the divine diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure at man's apoſtacy, and every inſtance of it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces melancholly reflections in ſurvivors.</p>
            <p>This dreadful penalty, with which the divine law was ſanctioned, is inflicted upon every age and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of man; the innocent babe of a day old, not excepted.</p>

            <p>Not only do the common ties of humanity call us to mourn over the dead; but a man's charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, his exalted ſtation in life, his diſtinguiſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities and extenſive benevolence, one conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which make his death to be univerſally la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</p>

When a man in a public ſtation dies, his abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, however great, of whatever utility and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance they were, are forever loſt to his fellow citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, to his country and to the world. All expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations from his future exertions for the good of his fellow men are cut off. His opportunities to ſerve his friends and his country, are at an end.</p>
            <p>When a great and good man in a ſtation of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence falls the victim of death, his country feels the loſs it ſenſibly effects the people at large, a whole nation (the ſons of Belial excepted) is troubled at his death, men of all ranks and every ſtation, feel the public loſs, and mourn, alas! our brother, our friend, our public father or illuſtrious chief.</p>
            <p>When Abner died, he was not only lamented by the King; but all the ſervants of David and the inhabitants of Judea wept: all felt the loſs of ſo great a man. It is moreover ſaid, that all the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites were troubled at his death, which is a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance ſhewing, that he was a man greatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved.</p>

One man, in whom a diſcerning mind, ſound judgment, virtuous integrity, extenſive influence and a generous patriotiſm are united and attached to a public ſtation, is a great ſupport to govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yea, he is one of the main props and pillars of the State; the good produced by his exertions is incalculable. Though the death of ſuch a man may not be an irreparable loſs, yet, it is a very great one. By his fall, the nation is bereaved of an able ſtateſman, government is deprived of a great ſupport: the people of a ſteady friend and the ſtate of a generous Benefactor. The cabinet is deprived of a wiſe Counſellor, or the Army of an able General, and the world of a valuable Citizen. One man of ſuperior talents and diſtinguiſhed vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues in the chair of State, is of more importance than many private perſons. So thought the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of David, when they ſaid to him as they were going out to battle againſt the rebellious Abſalom, "thou art worth ten thouſand of us." And when "they ſware to him ſaying thou ſhalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the light of Iſrael." As if the name and memory of Iſrael muſt die with their King.</p>

and an accompliſhed general. Yea, mankind have loſt a friend, and the world a beloved citizen.</p>
            <p>WASHINGTON, the father of his country, the zealous defender of its rights and liberties is no more! the man of the people, "the delight of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind" is dead! the dignified patriot, the able ſtateſman, the greateſt general the world could ever boaſt of, is fallen! the man whoſe character does honor to human nature is gone from us to ſeek a repoſe in the grave, from the toils of this mortal life. Could the words of the text ever be applied with more propriety than they are to that illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious perſonage? an honorable perſon and a great man is fallen in our Iſrael.</p>
            <p>All the manly and amiable virtues which beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the character and exalt the nature of man, ſeem to have united themſelves in WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, to make him the greateſt of men.

He was decided in his meaſures and conduct, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable in accompliſhing what he undertook, and was equal to the moſt important enterpriſes, civil or military—he was a man of ſuperior abilities, and extenſive influence.

In war he was terrible to the invaders of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's rights: but was generous to his foes; hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane to thoſe whom the fortune of war threw into his hands, "the enemies themſelves being

judges." In peace and war he was an unwavering friend to the rights of hoſpitality: he held them to be ſacred, he invaded them not, nor ſuffered them to be infringed within the circle of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence. He was the inflexible patriot; he loved his country ſincerely, and was the friend of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>WASHINGTON the great, had a good heart, and was attached to revealed religion.—His name ſtands recorded among the profeſſors of chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. He was not aſhamed to confeſs Chriſt and own himſelf to be a diſciple of the crucified Jeſus of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth. As he profeſſed, ſo he exemplified reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. He viſited the aſſemblies of God's profeſſing people, and joined with the worſhippers of Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah in their religious devotions. This I view as the moſt diſtinguiſhing trait in his character—and that which reflects peculiar honor upon the man, in whatever capacity we view him.</p>
            <p>WASHINGTON was truly the great man in the circle of domeſtic life; he was great in a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical view, and great in a military capacity. His great and amiable virtues were carried into every ſtation where God and his country placed him. His ſuperior talents and great abilities were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly employed for the good of his fellow citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens in every public ſtation he filled. His almoſt unbounded influence was invariably directed by a ſincere love to his country—pleaſing and happy were the effects produced by his benevolent exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

            <p>When the drama of a revolutionary war, which gave liberty and independence to more than three millions of people, was opened on the plains of Lexington: WASHINGTON, as the moſt ſuitable perſon among the thouſands of America, was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed commander in chief to direct the operations of war. With a diffidence which argued the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his mind, he accepted the important truſt. Refuſing every pecuniary reward for his ſervices as General of the American Armies, he put on the harneſs, he graſp'd the ſword and haſtened to the ſeat of war. The cordial benedictions and fervent prayers of thouſands in our Iſrael for his ſafety and ſucceſs, followed him to the camp.</p>
            <p>His conduct in the exalted rank of General of the army, through the fatigues, difficulties, and dangers of an eight years war, was ſuch as would have done honor to the moſt experienced General in the world. When that great man appeared at the head of our army, the eyes of America, and even of Europe were upon him. Thouſands were tortured with anxiety for the event—the breaſt of our country was big with expectation. He more than anſwered the hopes of the moſt ſanguine—His conduct was
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:038307_0016_10119E5F687ECE58"/>

               </gap> thoſe important, eſſential ſervices, which, I hope<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will be gratefully remembered by millions, now unborn.</p>
            <p>Through the whole ſcene of that unhappy conteſt WASHINGTON remained the calm, but inflexible Patriot; the intrepid, humane General.</p>
            <p>The war was at length conducted to a cloſe; long wiſhed for peace returned to bleſs our land.</p>
            <p>WASHINGTON diſbanded his army, reſigned his command, and quietly retired to the private walks of domeſtic life, to enjoy there the ſweets of conſcious integrity, and the ſelf approving reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of an untainted mind.</p>
            <p>When the Federal Conſtitution was to be organ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized, WASHINGTON was elected Preſident of the United States by the unanimous ſuffrages of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low citizens. Eight years he filled the chair of ſtate with peculiar dignity, and adminiſtered the Conſtitution with a fidelity which gave ſatisfaction to every enlightened virtuous patriot in the United States. His ſublime virtues and exalted talents, ſhone with equal luſtre in the cabinet as in the field.</p>
            <p>By the firm, decided conduct of this great man, order was maintained through the union. The efforts of a factious few, to miſlead the public mind, create diſturbances in the State, and involve the nation in the horrors of an European war, were happily counteracted.</p>
            <p>

A dangerous inſurrection raiſed in the bowels of the State by the intrigues of an inſidious foreigner, was cruſhed in the beginning. The hoſtile natives of the deſert were compelled to an honorable peace, and ſome unhappy differences exiſting between the American Republic, and the Kingdom of Great Britain, were amicably adjuſted.</p>
            <p>Having piloted the national bark through every ſtorm into ſafe port, he reſigned the Chair of State, and returned to thoſe peaceful ſcenes of domeſtic retirement, which he had reluctantly quitted in obedience to his country's call.</p>
            <p>But his uſefulneſs did not end here, one illuſtrious action more, remained to be added to the long liſt which had characteriſed the man from early life. At the call of God and his country, he conſented to jeopard his life again in the high places of the field. He accepted a military appointment to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the army to be raiſed in the United States, for their defence againſt any ſudden invaſion by the armies of France.</p>
            <p>When France, inſtigated by a boundleſs ambition and inſatiable avarice, wantonly ravaged our coaſt, and gave American property to indiſcriminate plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; WASHINGTON roſe indignant at the unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked inſults; he ſaw, he felt the wrongs; wrongs done to his country by a treacherous foe, who had long been concealed under the maſk of friendſhip. He heard his country's call, and ſtood ready to lead her choſen ſons to the field of battle, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>The appointment he accepted, was from his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor

in the office of Chief Magiſtrate! it was a demonſtration of a great and noble mind! it reflects a diſtinguiſhing luſtre upon the life of that great man.</p>
            <p>The name of WASHINGTON, General of the Armies of the United States, inſpired the ſons of freedom with a lively animation—and the veteran ſoldier with an impetuous ardor.</p>
            <p>While government was making preparation for the defence of the country, by raiſing and officering an army, to be arranged and commanded by the greateſt General in the world; every mind was filled with expectation, and all were waiting the events which God and time would bring forth;—Death, whoſe ravages are indiſcriminate, laid his arreſts upon our beloved Hero; General WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON died. His great abilities, ſublime virtues and goodneſs of heart, could not exempt him from death, the common lot of humanity. He died as a man! as a common mortal! but he died as a good man; he left the world in peace. In the full exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of his reaſon, and under ſtrong apprehenſions of the time of his departure being come, he was calm, and entered the valley of the ſhadow of death, with a ſerenity of mind, which ſeems to be peculiar to thoſe who have Heaven and the joys of the divine preſence in the proſpect before them. We hope he is now enjoying the rewards of a well ſpent life, that his death is infinite gain to him. But our loſs is very great.</p>

            <p>What ſhall we ſay? that "the beauty of America is fallen? that the light of our Iſrael is quenched?" Let us hope and pray that a double portion of the ſpirit of WASHINGTON may reſt on his ſucceſſors.</p>
            <p>Lament for him we muſt; he was "lovely and pleaſant in his life," he was our friend, he was the friend of our country and of mankind.</p>

            <p>We may ſay in the words of the Queen of Sheba to Solomon, "bleſſed be the Lord our God, who delighted in that man to place him at the head of our armies, and in the chair of State," becauſe the Lord loved us, he gave us WASHINGTON to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in the field and in the cabinet.</p>
