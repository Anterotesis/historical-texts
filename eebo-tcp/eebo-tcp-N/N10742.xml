            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A SPEECH INTENDED to have been SPOKEN on the BILL, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IT is of ſuch great importance to compoſe or even to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate diſſentions, which ſubſiſt at preſent between our unhappy country and her colonies, that I cannot help endeavouring, from the faint proſpect I have of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing ſomething to ſo good an end, to overcome the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible reluctance I feel at ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering my thoughts before the moſt reſpectable of all audiences.</p>
            <p>The true object of all our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration on this occaſion, which I hope we ſhall never loſe ſight of, is a full and cordial reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with North America. Now I own my Lords, I have many doubts whether the terrors and puniſhments, we hang out to them at preſent, are the ſureſt means of producing this reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation. Let us at leaſt do this juſtice to the people of North America, to own, that we can all remember a time when they were much better friends than at preſent to their mother country. They are neither our natural nor our determined enemies. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Stamp Act, we conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in the light of as good ſubjects as the natives of any county in England.</p>
            <p>It is worth while to enquiry by what ſteps we firſt gained their affection, and preſerved it ſo long; and by what conduct we have lately loſt it. Such an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry may point out the means of reſtoring peace, and make the uſe of force unneceſſary againſt a people, whom I cannot yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to conſider as our brethren.</p>
            <p>It has always been a moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous taſk to govern diſtant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, with even a tolerable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of juſtice. The vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roys and governors of other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are uſually temporary ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, who think themſelves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to make the moſt of their time; who not only plunder the people, but carry away their ſpoils, and dry up all the ſources of commerce and induſtry. Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in their hands, is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited power of oppreſſion: but in whatever hands the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of taxation is lodged, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies and includes all other pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Arbitrary taxation is plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der authoriſed by law: It is the ſupport and the eſſence of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny; and has done more miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to mankind, than thoſe other three ſcourges from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, famine, peſtilence and the ſword. I need not carry your Lordſhips out of your own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or out of your own domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, to make you conceive what miſery this right of taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is capable of producing in a
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:013615_0003_0F905A835B3EE638"/>
provincial government. We need only recollect that our countrymen in India, have in the ſpace of five or ſix years, in virtue of this right, deſtroyed, ſtarved and driven away more inhabitants from Bengal, than are to be found at preſent in all our American Colonies; more than all thoſe formidable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers which we have been nurſing up for the ſpace of 200 years, with ſo much care and ſucceſs, to the aſtoniſhment of all Europe. This is no exaggeration, my Lords, but plain matter of fact, collected from the accounts ſent over by Mr. Haſtings, whoſe name I mention with honour and veneration. And I muſt own, ſuch accounts have very much leſſened the pleaſure I uſed to feel in thinking myſelf an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhman. We ought ſurely not to hold our colonies totally inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable for wiſhing to exempt themſelves from a grievance, which has cauſed ſuch unexam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled devaſtation; and, my Lords, it would be too diſgraceful to ourſelves, to try ſo cruel an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment more than once. Let us reflect, that before theſe inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations were thought of, by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the line of good conduct which had been marked out by our anceſtors, we governed North America with mutual benefit to them and ourſelves It was a happy idea, that made us firſt conſider them rather as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of commerce than as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of government. It was wiſe and generous to give them the form and the ſpirit of our own conſtitution; an aſſembly in which a greater equality of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation has been preſerved than at home; and councils and governors, ſuch as were adapted to their ſituation, though they muſt be acknowledged to be very inferior copies of the dignity of this Houſe, and the Majeſty of the Crown.</p>
            <p>But what is far more valuable than all the reſt, we gave them liberty. We allowed them to uſe their own judgment in the management of their own inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. The idea of taxing them never entered our heads. On the contrary they have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced our liberality on many public occaſions: we have given them bounties to encourage their induſtry, and have demanded no return but what every ſtate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act from its colonies, the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of an excluſive commerce, and the regulations that are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſecure it. We made requiſitions to them on great occaſions, in the ſame manner as our princes formerly aſked benevolences of their ſubjects; and as nothing was aſked but what was viſibly for the public good, it was always granted: and they ſometimes did more than we expected. The matter of right was neither diſputed, nor even conſidered. And let us not forget that the people of New-England were themſelves, during the laſt war, the moſt forward of all in the national cauſe; that every year we voted them a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſum, in acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their zeal and their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; that in the pr<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ceeding war, they alone enabled us to make the treaty of Aix la Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelle, by furniſhing us with the only equivalent for the towns that were taken from our allies in Flanders; and that in times of peace, they alone have taken from us ſix times as much of our woollen manufactures, as the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:013615_0004_0F905A8419EE5610"/>
whole kingdom of Ireland. Such a colony, my Lords, not only from the juſtice, but from the gratitude we owe them, have a right to be heard in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; and if their crimes are not of the moſt inexpiable kind, I could almoſt ſay, they have a right to be forgiven.</p>
            <p>But in the times we ſpeak of, our public intercourſe was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on with eaſe and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. We regarded them as our friends and fellow-citizens, and relied as much upon their fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as on the inhabitants of our own country. They ſaw our power with pleaſure; for they conſidered it only as their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. They inherited our laws, our language, and our cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms; they preferred our manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, and followed our faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with a partiality, that ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our excluſive trade with them more effectually than all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations and vigilance of the cuſtom houſe. Had we ſuffered them to enrich us a little longer and to grow a little richer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, their men of fortune, like the Weſt-Indians, would undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly have made this country their place of education and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort. For they looked up to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land with reverence and affection, as to the country of their friends and anceſtors. They eſteemed and they called it their home, and thought of it as the Jews once thought of the Land of Canaan.</p>
            <p>Now, my Lords, conſider with yourſelves what were the chains and ties that united this people to their mother country, with ſo much warmth and affection, at ſo amazing a diſtance. The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies of other nations have been diſcontented with their treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not without ſufficient cauſe; always murmuring at their grievances, and ſometimes breaking out into acts of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. Our ſubjects at home, with all their reaſons for ſatisfaction, have never been entirely ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Since the beginning of this century we have had two rebellions, ſeveral plots and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies; and we ourſelves have been witneſſes to the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous exceſſes of ſedition. But the provinces in North-America have engaged in no party, have excited no oppoſition; they have been utter ſtrangers even to the name of Whig and Tory. In all changes in all revolutions, they have quietly followed the fortunes and ſubmitted to the government of England.</p>
            <p>Now let me appeal to your Lordſhips as to men of enlarged and liberal minds, who have been led by your office and rank to the ſtudy of hiſtory. Can you find in the long ſucceſſion of ages, in the whole extent of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man affairs, a ſingle inſtance, where diſtant provinces have been preſerved in ſo flouriſhing a ſtate, and kept at the ſame time in ſuch due ſubjection to their mother country? My Lords, there is no inſtance; the caſe never exiſted before. It is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the moſt ſingular phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon in all civil hiſtory: and the cauſe of it well deſerves your ſerious conſideration. The true cauſe is, that a mother country never exiſted before, who placed her natives and her colonies on the ſame equal ſooting; and joined with them in fairly carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on one common intereſt.</p>
            <p>You ought to conſider this, my Lords, not as a mere hiſtorical fact, but as a moſt important and
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:013615_0005_0F905A855A789898"/>
invaluable diſcovery. It enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es our ideas of the power and energy of good government be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all former examples; and ſhews that it can act like grava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation at the greateſt diſtances. It proves to a demonſtration that you may have good ſubjects in the remoteſt corners of the earth, if you will but treat them with kindneſs and equity. If you have any doubts of the truth of this kind of reaſoning, the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence we have had of a different kind will entirely remove them.</p>
            <p>The good genius of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try had led us to the ſimple and happy method of governing free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which I have endeavoured to deſcribe. Our miniſters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it from their predeceſſors, and for ſome time continued to obſerve it; but without knowing its value. At length, preſuming on their own wiſdom, and the quiet diſpoſition of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, they flattered themſelves that we might reap great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages from their proſperity by deſtroying the cauſe of it. They choſe in an unlucky hour to treat them as other nations have tho't fit to treat their colonies; they threatened and they taxed them.</p>
            <p>I do not now enquire whether taxation is matter of right; I only conſider it as matter of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment; for ſurely the art of government itſelf is founded on experience. I need not ſuggeſt what were the conſequences of this change of meaſures. The evils produced by it were ſuch as we ſtill remember and ſtill feel. We ſuffered more by our loſs of trade with them than the wealth flowing in from India was able to recompence. The bankrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Eaſt India Company may be ſufficiently accounted for by the rapine abroad and the knavery at home; but it certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would have been delayed ſome years, had we continued our commerce with them in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle article of tea. But that and many other branches of trade have been diverted into other channels, and may probably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver return intire to their old courſe. But what is worſt of all, we have loſt their confidence and friendſhip; we have ignorantly undermined the moſt ſolid foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our own power.</p>
            <p>In order to obſerve the ſtricteſt impartiality, it is but juſt for us to enquire what we have gained by theſe taxes as well as what we have loſt. I am aſſured that out of all the ſums raiſed in America the laſt year but one, if the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences are deducted, which the natives would elſe have diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves, the net revenue paid into the Treaſury to go in aid of the ſinking fund, or to be employed in whatever public ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices parliament ſhall think fit, is eighty five pounds. Eighty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>five pounds, my Lords, is the whole equivalent, we have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for all the hatred and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and all the infinite loſſes this kingdom has ſuffered during that year in her diſputes with North America. Money that is earned ſo dearly as this, ought to be expended with great aeconomy. My Lords, were you to take up but one thouſand pounds more from North America upon the ſame terms, the nation itſelf would be a bankrupt. But the moſt amazing and the moſt alarming circumſtances is ſtill behind. It is that our caſe is ſo incurable, that all this experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence has made no impreſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. And yet, my Lords, if
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013615_0006_0F905A85E11DFB48"/>
you could but keep theſe facts, which I have ventured to lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, for a few moments in your minds, (ſuppoſing your right of taxation to be never ſo clear) yet <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> you muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily perceive that it cannot be exerciſed in any manner that can be advantageous to ourſelves or them. We have not always the wiſdom to tax ourſelves with propriety; and I am confident we could never tax a people at that diſtance, without infinite blunders and infinite opereſſion. And to own the truth, my Lord, we are not honeſt enough to truſt ourſelves with the power of ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our own burthens upon them. Allow me, therefore, to conclude, I think, unanſwerably, that the inconvenience and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs we have felt in this change of our conduct, no leſs than the eaſe and tranquility we formerly found in the purſuit of it, will force us, if we have any ſenſe left, to return to the good old path we trod in ſo long, and found it the way of pleaſantneſs.</p>
            <p>I deſire to have it underſtood, that I am oppoſing no rights that our legiſlature may think proper to claim: I am only comparing two different methods of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. By your old rational and generous adminiſtration, by treating the Americans as your friends and fellow-citizens, you made them the happieſt of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man kind; and at the ſame time drew from them, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, more clear profit than Spain has drawn from its mines; and their growing numbers were a daily increaſing addition to your ſtrength. There was no room for improvement or altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ſo noble a ſyſtem of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy as this. It was ſanctified by time by experience, by public <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. I will venture to uſe a bold language, my Lords; I will aſſert, that if we had uniformly adopted this equitable admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration in all our diſtant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces as far as circumſtances would admit, it would have placed this country, for ages, at the head of human affairs in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry quarter of the world My Lords, this is no viſionary or chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical doctrine. The idea of governing provinces and colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies by force is viſionary and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. The experiment has often been tried and it has never ſucceeded. It ends infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly in the ruin of the one coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try or the other, or in the laſt degree of wretchedneſs.</p>
            <p>If there is any truth, my Lords, in what I have ſaid, and I moſt firmly believe it all to be true: let me recommend it ſo you to reſume that generous and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent ſpirit in the diſcuſſion of our differences, which uſed to be the ſource of our union. We certainly did wrong in taxing them: when the Stamp Act was repealed, we did wrong in laying on other taxes, which tended only to keep alive a claim that was miſchievous, impracticable and uſeleſs. We acted contrary to our own principles of liberty, and to the generous ſentiments of our ſovereign, when he deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have their judges depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant on the crown for their ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends as well as their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance It was equally unwiſe to wiſh to make the governors, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant of the people for their ſalaries. We ought to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the governors not as ſpies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the management of our intereſt, but as the ſervant of the people, recommended to
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013615_0007_0F905A8892BAA998"/>
them by us. Our ears ought to be open to very complaint againſt the governors; but we ought not to ſuffer the governors to complain of the people. We have taken a different method, to which no ſmall part of our difficulties are owing. Our ears have been op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to the governors and ſhut to the people. This muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily lead us to countenance the jobbs of intereſted men, under the pretence of defending the rights of the crown. But the people are certainly the beſt judges whether they are well governed; and the crown can have no rights inconſiſtent with the happineſs of the people.</p>
            <p>Now, my Lords, we ought to do what I have ſuggeſted, and many things more, out of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and juſtice, to win their affection, and to do them public ſervice. If we have a right to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern them, let us exert it for the true ends of governments. But, my Lords, what we ought to do, from motives of reaſon and juſtice, is much more than is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to being them to a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble accommodation. For thus, as I apprehend, ſtands the caſe. They petition for the repeal of an act of parliament, which they complain of as unjuſt and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive. And there is not a man amongſt us, not the warmeſt friend of adminiſtration, who does not ſincerely wiſh that act had never been made. In fact, they only aſk for what we wiſh to be rid of. Under ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of mind. one would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine there could be no occaſion for fleets and armies to bring men to a good underſtanding But, my Lords, our difficulty lies in the point of honour. We muſt not let down the dignity of the mother-country; but preſerve her ſovereignty over all the parts of the Britiſh Empire. This language has ſomething in at that ſounds pleaſant to the earn of Engliſhmen, but is otherwiſe of little weight. For, ſure my Lords, there are methods of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reaſonable conceſſions, and yet without injuring our dignity. Miniſters are generally fruitful in expedients to reconcile diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of this kind, to eſcape the embaraſſment of forms, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of dignity and prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency; and to let claſhing rights <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, while they tranſact their buſineſs. Now, my Lords, on this occaſion can they find no excuſe, no pretence, no inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no happy turn of language, not one colourable argument for doing the greateſt ſervice, they can ever render to their country? It muſt be ſomething more than incapacity that makes men bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of expedients at ſuch a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as this Do, but for once, remove this impracticable ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and dignity and treat the matter with a little common ſenſe and a little good humour, and our reconciliation would not be the work of an hour But after all, my Lords, if there is any thing mortifying in undoing the errors of our miniſters, it is a mortification we ought to ſubmit to. If it was unjuſt to tax them, we ought to repeal it for their ſakes; if it was unwiſe to tax them, we ought to repeal it for our own. A matter ſo trivial in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a three penny duty upon tea, but which has given cauſe to ſo much national hatred and reproach, ought not to be ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſubſiſt an unneceſſary day. Muſt the intereſt, the commerce and the union of this country and her colonies, be all of them ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed to ſave the credit of one
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013615_0008_0F905A88ADD02A28"/>
imprudent meaſure of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration? I own I cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that there is any digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty either in being in the wrong, or in perſiſting in it. I have known friendſhip preſerved and affection gained, but I never knew dignity loſt, by the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did acknowledgement of an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. And, my Lords, let me ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to your own experience of a few years backward (I will not mention particulars, becauſe I would paſs no cenſures and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive no unpleaſant reflections) but I think every candid mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter muſt own, that adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has ſuffered in more inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces than one, both in intereſt and credit, by not chuſing to give up points, that could not be defended.</p>
            <p>With regard to the people of Boſton, I am free to own that I neither approve of their riots nor their puniſhment. And yet if we inflict it as we ought, with a conſciouſneſs that we were our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the aggreſſors, that we gave the provocation, and that their diſobedience is the fruit of our own imprudent and imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conduct, I think the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot riſe to any great degree of ſeverity.</p>
            <p>I own my Lords, I have read the report of the Lords Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees of this houſe, with very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſentiments from thoſe with which it was drawn up. It ſeems to be deſigned, that we ſhould conſider their violent meaſures and ſpeeches, as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny determined acts of oppoſition to the ſovereignty of England, ariſing from the malignity of their own hearts. One would think the mother country had been totally ſilent and paſſive in the progreſs of the whole affair. I on the contrary conſider theſe violences as the natural effects of ſuch meaſures as ours on the minds of freemen. And this is the moſt uſeful point of view, in which government can conſider them. In their ſituation, a wiſe man would expect to meet with the ſtrongeſt marks of paſſion and imprudence, and be prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to forgive them. The firſt and eaſieſt thing to be done is to correct our own errors; and I am confident we ſhould find it the moſt effectual method to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect theirs. At any rate let us put ourſelves in the right; and then if we muſt contend with North America, we ſhall be una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous at home, and the wiſe and the moderate there will be our friends. At preſent we force every North American to be our enemy: and the wiſe and the moderate at home, and thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe multitudes, which muſt ſoon begin to ſuffer by the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our rulers, will unite to oppoſe them. It is a ſtrange idea we have taken up, to cure their reſentments by increaſing their provocations; to remove the effects of our own ill conduct, by multiplying the inſtances of it. But the ſpirit of blindneſs and infatuation is gone forth. We are hurrying wildly on with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any fixed deſign, without any important object. We pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue a vain phantom of unlimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſovereignty, which was not made for man; and reject the ſolid advantages of a moderate, uſeful and intelligible authority. That juſt God, whom we have all ſo deeply offended, can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inflict a ſeverer national puniſhment, than by committing us to the natural conſequences of our own conduct. Indeed, in my opinion a blacker cloud ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hung over this Iſland.</p>

               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:013615_0009_0F905A89F64FBF60"/>
To reaſon conſiſtently with the principles of juſtice and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional friendſhip, which I have endeavoured to eſtabliſh, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to revive what was eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our anceſtors, as our wiſeſt rule of conduct for the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of America; I muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily diſapprove of the Bill before us; for it contradicts every one of them. In our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſituation every act of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature, even our acts of ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ought to be ſo many ſteps to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the reconciliation we wiſh for. But to change the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a people, without their conſent, is the higheſt and moſt arbitrary act of ſovereignty, that one nation can exerciſe over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Romans hardly ever proceeded to this extremity even over a conquered nation, till its frequent revolts and inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had made them deem it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible The very idea of it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a moſt total and abject, ſlaviſh dependency in the inferior ſtate. Recollect that the Americans are men of like paſſions with our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and think how deeply this treatment muſt affect them. They have the ſame veneration for their Charters, that we have for our Magna Charta, and they ought in reaſon to have greater. They are the title deeds to all their rights both public and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate. What? my Lords, muſt theſe rights never acquire any legal aſſurance and ſtability? Can they derive no force from the peaceable poſſeſſion of near two hundred years? And muſt the fundamental conſtitution of a powerful ſtate, be forever ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to as capricious alterations as you may think fit to make, in the charters of a little mercan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile company or the corporation of a borough? This will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly furniſh matter for a more pernicious debate than has yet been moved. Every other colony will make the caſe its own. They will complain that their rights can never be aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; that every thing belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them depends upon our arbitrary will; and may think it better to run any hazard, than to ſubmit to the violence of their mother country, in a matter in which they can ſee neither mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration nor end.</p>
            <p>But let us coolly enquire, what is the reaſon of this unheard of innovation. Is it to make them peaceable? My Lords, it will make them mad. Will they be better governed if we introduce this change? Will they be more our friends? The leaſt that ſuch a meaſure can do, is to make them hate us. And would to God, my Lords, we had govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ourſelves with as much oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, integrity and prudence as they have done. Let <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> continue to enjoy the liberty our fathers gave them. Gave them, did I ſay? They are co-heirs of liberty with ourſelves; and their portion of the inheritance has been much better looked after than ours. Suffer them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a little longer that ſhort pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of public integrity and domeſtic happineſs, which ſeems to be the portion allotted by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to young riſing ſtates. Inſtead of hoping that their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution may receive improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from our ſkill in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the moſt uſeful wiſh I can form in their favour is, that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven may long preſerve them from our vices and our politics.</p>
            <p>Let me add farther, that to make any changes in their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013615_0010_0F905A8A15D73790"/>
without their conſent would be to tranſgreſs the wiſeſt rules of policy, and to wound our moſt important intereſts. As they increaſe in numbers and in riches, our comparative ſtrength muſt leſſen. In another age, when our power has begun to loſe ſomething of its ſuperiority, we ſhould be happy if we could ſupport our authority by mutual good will and the habit of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding; but chiefly by thoſe original eſtabliſhments, which time and public honour might have rendered inviolable. Our poſterity will then have reaſon to lament that they cannot avail themſelves of thoſe treaſures of public friendſhip and confidence which our fathers had wiſely boarded up, and we are throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away. 'Tis hard, 'tis cruel, beſide: all our debts and taxes, and thoſe enormous expences which are multiplying upon us every year, to load our unhappy ſons with the hatred and curſes of North America. Indeed, my Lords, we are treating poſterity very ſcurvily. We have mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged all the lands; we have cut down all the oaks; we are now trampling down the fences, root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the ſeedlings and ſamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and ruining all the reſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of another age. We ſhall ſend the next generation into the world, like the wretched heir of a worthleſs father, without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, credit or friend; with a ſtripped, incumbered, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps untenanted eſtate.</p>
            <p>Having ſpoke ſo largely againſt the principle of the bill, it is hardly neceſſary to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the merits of it. I ſhall only obſerve, that even if we had the conſent of the people to alter their government, it would be unwiſe to make ſuch alterations as theſe. To give the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the governor and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to the crown, and the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of all places, even of the judges, and with a power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving them, to the governor, is evidently calculating with a view to form a ſtrong party in our favour. This I know has been done in other colonies; but ſtill this is opening a ſource of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual diſcord, where it is our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt always to agree. If we mean any thing by this eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is to ſupport the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or and the council againſt the people, i e. to quarrel with our friends, that we may pleaſe their ſervants. This ſcheme of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning them by a party is not wiſely imagined, it is much too premature, and at all events, muſt turn to our diſadvantage. If it fails, it will only make us contemptible; if it ſucceeds, it will make us odius. It is our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to take very little part in their domeſtic adminiſtration of government, but purely to watch over them for their good. We never gained ſo much by North-America as when we let them go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern themſelves, and were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to trade with them and to protect them. One would think, my Lords, there was ſome ſtatute law, prohibiting us, under the ſevereſt penalties, to profit by experience.</p>
            <p>My Lords, I have ventured to lay my thoughts before you, on the greateſt national concern that ever came under your deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, with as much honeſty as you will meet with from abler men, and with a melancholy aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, that not a word of it will be regarded. And yet, my Lords, with your permiſſion, I
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013615_0011_0F905A8AD3B0B1F8"/>
will waſte one ſhort argument more on the ſame cauſe, one that I own I am fond of, and which contains in it, what I think, muſt affect every generous mind. My Lords, I look upon North-America as the only great nurſery of free men now left upon the face of the earth. We have ſeen the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Poland and Sweden ſwept away, in the courſe of one year, by treachery and uſurpation. The free towns in Germany are like ſo many dying ſparks, that go out one after another; and which muſt all be ſoon exting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhed under the deſtructive great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſs of their neighbours. Hol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>land is little more than a great trading company, with luxurious manners, and an exhauſted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue; with little ſtrength and with leſ ſpirit. Switzerland alone is free and happy within the narrow incloſure of its rocks and vallies. As for the ſtate of this country, my Lords, I can only refer myſelf to your own ſecret thoughts. I am diſpoſed to think and hope the beſt of public Liberty. Were I to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe her according to my own ideas at preſent, I ſhould ſay that ſhe has a ſickly countenance, but I truſt ſhe has a ſtrong conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</p>
            <p>But whatever may be our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture fate, the greateſt glory that attends this country, a greater than any other nation ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, is to have formed and nurſed up to ſuch a ſtate of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, thoſe colonies whom we are now ſo eager to butcher. We ought to cheriſh them as the immortal monuments of our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic juſtice and wiſdom; as the heirs of our better days, of our old arts and manners, and of our expiring national virtues. What work of art, or power, or public utility has ever equalled the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of having peopled a continent without guilt or bloodſhed, with a multitude of free and happy common wealths; to have given them the beſt arts of life and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and to have ſuffered them under the ſhelter of our authority, to acquire in peace the ſkill to uſe them. In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of this, the policy of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning by influence, and even the pride of war and victory are diſhoneſt tricks and poor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible pageantry.</p>
            <p>We ſeem not to be ſenſible of the high and important truſt which providence has committed to our charge. The moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious remains of civil liberty, that the world can now boaſt of, are lodged in our hands; and God forbid that we ſhould vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ſo ſacred a depoſit. By en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaving your colonies, you not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ruin the peace, commerce, and the fortunes of both coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; but you extinguiſh the faireſt hopes, ſhut up the laſt aſylum of mankind. I think, my Lords without being weakly ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions, that a good man may hope that heaven will take part againſt the execution of a plan which ſeems big, not only with miſchief, but impiety.</p>
            <p>Let us be content with the ſpoils and deſtruction of the eaſt. If your Lordſhips can ſee no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety in it, let the plunderer and the oppreſſor ſtill go free But let not the love of lib<gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="4 letters">

No nation has ever before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, in ſo ſhort a ſpace of time without any war or public ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity (unleſs unwiſe meaſures may be ſo called) to deſtroy ſuch ample reſources of commerce, wealth and power, as of late were ours, and which, if they had been rightly improved, might have raiſed us to a ſtate of more hon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ourable and more permanent greatneſs than the world has yet ſeen.</p>
            <p>Let me remind the noble Lords in adminiſtration, that before the ſtamp act, they had power ſufficient to anſwer all the juſt ends of government, and they were all compleatly anſwered. If that is the power they want, though we have loſt much of it at preſent, a few kind words would recover it all.</p>
            <p>But if the tendency of this bill is, as I own it appears to me, to acquire a power of governing them by influence and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; in the firſt place my Lords, this is not true government, but a ſophiſticated kind, which coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeits the appearance, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſpirit or virtue of the true: and then, as it tends to debaſe their ſpirits and corrupt their manners to deſtroy all that is great and reſpectable in ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable a part of the human ſpecies and by degrees to gather them together with the reſt of the world. under the yoke of univerſal ſlavery; I think, for thoſe reaſons, it is the duty of every wiſe man, of every honeſt man, and of every Engliſhman, by all lawful means, to oppoſe it.</p>
