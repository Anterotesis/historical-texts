            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <bibl>2 Sam. 23. 3.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THese words may be considered two wayes; 1. As hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth a Prophecy of the Kingdom of the Messiah, who is the Mediator, Surety, and Head of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, for his People. In which Covenant <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> comforted himself whatever decayes should befall him, or his house in after-times. 2. As holding forth a Rule for the choice and ordering of Rulers over men. According to this consideration of the words, I purpose to handle them at this time, as best suiting with the present occasion. And so the words hold forth a Rule of Wisdom, whereunto the Lord teacheth his People to apply their hearts, in setling Civil Government according to God's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, so as they may expect the presence and blessing of God, through Jesus Christ with them, and upon the Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>I shall sum up all in one Doctrinal Conclusion, which shall be this;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That it is the Ordinance of God, in reference to Civil Government in Commonwealths, that some men orderly chosen should rule over other men: and in reference to the qualification of Rulers, that they be just, ruling in the fear of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which is twofold. 1. Concerning the thing; <hi>that some men should rule over others.</hi> 2. Concerning the qualification of the persons that are to rule; <hi>that they be just, ruling in the fear of God.</hi> In this way of his Ordinance you see, in my Text, both these are joyned together, and noted as the Ordinance of God, in the Trinity of Persons, God the Father said it, who is called <hi>the God of Israel,</hi> by vertue of his gracious Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them: and God the Son spake it, who is stiled, <hi>the Rock of Israel,</hi> for that title is ascribed to Christ the Mediator, and second Person:<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4.</note> 
               <hi>For they drank of the Spiritual Rock that followed them, and the Rock was Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:039179_0003_10141BD8F75ED5D0"/>
And they both spake it to <hi>David</hi> by the third Person, the Holy Spirit, who spake by <hi>David,</hi> ver. 2. But I shall handle them severally.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The first, that in reference to Civil Order in the Commonweal, God hath ordained. That some men; orderly chosen, should rule over other men.</p>
            <p>It is not my purpose to discourse of the several Forms of Government, <hi>Monarchical, Aristocratical,</hi> and <hi>Democratical,</hi> nor to trouble you with the divers readings of the words, according to the Original, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to handle them as they are translated, and read in all your Bibles. From whence the Doctrine is collected. And the first thing to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Power of Civil Rule, by men orderly chosen, is Gods Ordinance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is from the Light and Law of Nature, and the Law of Nature is God's Law.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The orderly ruling of men over men, in general, is from God, in its root, though voluntary in the manner of coalescing: It being supposed that men be combined in Family-Society, it is necessary that they be joyned in a Civil-Society; that union being made, the power of Civil-Government, and of making Laws, followeth naturally, though the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of union, in a Political Body, is voluntary. That we defend our selves from violence and wrong, is a consequent of pure Nature: but that we do it by devolving our Power into the hands of Civil Rulers, this seems to be rather positively moral, than natural.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Because this special Form of Civil Government of Commonweales, by men orderly chosen, the Scripture ascribes unto God; and also Civil Government, administred by Judges and Magistrates, as Christ spake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Pilate,</hi> Joh. 19. 11. <hi>Jesus answered, Thou couldst have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above:</hi> and they are said to <hi>judge not for man, but for the Lord,</hi> 2 Chron. 19. 6. hence they are called <hi>Gods,</hi> Psal. 82. 6, 7. as appointed by him, according to Christ's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of those words, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 35. <hi>If he calleth them Gods, unto whom the Word of God was given.</hi> See what the Wisdom of God, which is Jesus Christ, saith in <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 15, 16. <hi>By me Kings reign, and Princes decree ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> In 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13, 14. Civil Government by Civil Rulers is called a <hi>humane Ordinance,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Not to shew that it is a meer humane invention, and no Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God: for that is contradictory to <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. <hi>The Powers that be, are ordained of God.</hi> ver. 2. and <hi>he</hi> that <hi>resisteth, resisteth the Ordinance
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:039179_0004_10141BDC070DE498"/>
of God.</hi> But it is so called, 1. Because men are the subject recipient of this Power. So the Syriack expresseth it, <hi>Leculhum benai aushe,</hi> Obey all sons of men that are in Authority. 2. Because the Choice hereunto is from God by men, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Bring you men of Wisdom, and of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and known among your Tribes, and I will make them Rulers over you.</hi> 3. Because humane Concernments are the proper objects of it.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 4.</note> 
               <hi>If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them up which are least esteemed in the Churches.</hi> 4. Because the good of humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties is the end of it. Therefore <hi>Durandus,</hi> in his Book, <hi>De Origine Juris,</hi> saith well, Civil Power, according to God's Institution is of God, and according to its acquisition and use, it is of man. And whereas <hi>Peter</hi> extends this subjection to two sorts of objects; to the King as Supream, and to other Governors as sent by him, for the punishment of evil doers, and for the praise of them that do well; He therefore establisheth the Ruling Power over men in all sorts of Magistrates, who may be said to be sent by the King, either immediate (as some are sent by express designa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Person to such an office) or mediately, by his Royal Charter given to Corporations, to choose from among themselves, such as they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count fit for such a trust. This is our case, who have by Patent from the King, liberty and power to chuse a Governour, and Deputy-Governour, and a limitted Number of Assistants, invested with Magistratical Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the People. My Text saith, He that Ruleth over men, whether as Supream or Subordinate, as being sent by him upon the Peoples choice, must be just, ruling in the fear of the Lord: Therefore we must distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish between Family-Rulers, and Commonwealth-Rulers: Family-Rulers, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> Husbands and Parents, are the Ordinance of God, without designation of the Persons thereunto, by Commission from the King, or Election of the People: but it is not so with Rulers of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: For the designation of these, or those, to be Civil Rulers, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out others, is from God, by the Peoples free Choice, at least by the Suffrages of the major part of them, wherein the rest must acquiesce: This Power of Rulers of the Common-wealth is derived from the Peoples free Choice (therefore it is said in the Doctrine, being orderly chosen) for the Power of Government, is originally in the People, and that Three Wayes:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Radically and vertually, as in the first Subject. For these Reasons. 1. Because, if living Creatures have radically in them a power of self-preservation, to defend themselves from violence and wrongs; men united in Societies, being reasonable Creatures, must have that power in a more reasonable and honorable way, to put this power into the hands of Civil
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:039179_0005_10141BDE9FCF1100"/>
Rulers; nor doth a Community, in chusing Civil Rulers, surrender so much their right and liberty to their Rulers, as their Power, both Active to do, and Passive to suffer unjust violence, so as the People shall not have Moral Power to do, or avenge injuries, <hi>proprio marte,</hi> without punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 2. Because, if men United in a Civil Society, may give Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratical Power to such and such, leaving out others; (then this Power was in this united Society; but it was not in them <hi>formally</hi> (for then all should be Rulers) therefore this Power was in them only <hi>virtually;</hi> for <hi>Nemo dat quod non habet,</hi> None can give that which they have not either formally, or virtually in themselves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Communicatively, By way of free Donation; the People giving to this or that man, and not to others, the Ruling Power over them. For, 1. In regular actings of the creature, God is the first Agent; there are not two several and distinct actings, one of God, another of the People: but in one and the same action, God, by the Peoples suffrages, makes such an one Governour, or Magistrate, and not another. 2. God regulateth his People exercising their Power, in chusing such and such, and not others, to Rule over them; therefore they have Power from God's Ordinance to do it: for none can regulate a <hi>Non Ens,</hi> nor will God by his Word re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate unwarrantable actions, as he doth this. <hi>Exod</hi> 18. 21. <hi>Moreover, provide thou among all the People men of courage, fearing God, men dealing truly, hating covetousness; and appoint such over them, to be Rulers over thousands, Rulers over hundreds. &amp;c.</hi> Deut. 1. 16, 17. <hi>And I charged your Judges, that same time, saying, Hear the Controversies between your Brethren, and judge righteously between every Man and his Brother, and the Stranger that is with him; ye shall have no respect of persons in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not fear the face of man, for the judgement is Gods, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Limitively; For the People so give Magistratical Power unto some, as that still they retain in themselves these Three Acts, 1. That they may measure out so much Civil Power, as God in his Word alloweth to them, and no more, nor less. 2. That they may set bounds and banks to the exercise of that Power, so as it may not be exuberant, above the Laws, and due Rights and Liberties of the People. 3. That they give it out conditionally, upon this or that condition; so as, if the condition be violated, they may resume their power of chusing another.</p>
            <p>Thus you see the first part of God's Ordinance, concerning Civil Rule and Government in Commonwealths, by some orderly chosen hereunto. The second part of God's Ordinance in this matter, followeth, which is concerning the qualifications of such Rulers over men.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:039179_0006_10141BE931ED24A8"/>
2. That, as to the qualifications of Rulers over other men, it is God's Ordinance, that they <hi>be just, ruling in the fear of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. They <hi>must be just.</hi> They are to be termed just, in the sense of this Text, whose wills are sanctified and inclined by the Spirit of God, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to men whatsoever is due to them according to the Rules of the Word. 1. The principal and efficient hereof, is the sanctifying Spirit: therefore it is said,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 9.</note> the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and truth. 2. The proper subject recipient of this gift of Grace, is the sanctified will, into which it puts a bent and inclination unto righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.

               <hi>Motive.</hi> 1. The choice of good Rulers will be a sign and pledge of Gods intendment to bless their Government and his People thereby. For when God gives Rulers, whom he intends to make a blessing to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they shall be such as are blessed of him in Christ for the good of that People, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 25, 26. <hi>Then I will turn mine hand upon thee, and burn out thy dross, till it be pure, and take away all thy tinn; and I will restore thy Judges as at the first, and thy Counsellors as at the beginning.</hi> If this be neglected, the Government will not be blessed, and the welfare of the People will be ruined. But if Christ bless the Governours, he shall be our peace, whatsoever Enemies come against us, or rise up among us: And

But you have no Instance in Scripture, that ever God was with a People to bless them, in a course of special Providence, when they that feared not God, were their Rulers, by their own consent and choice: Let Christ therefore have the preheminence in all things, and in your choice of Rulers for the Commonwealth; and in order thereunto, see that they whom you choose to be Rulers, be men interressed personally in Christ: For when they that are called to Ruling Power, cease to exert it in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serviency to the Kingdom of Christ, there will be an end of <hi>New-England</hi>'s Glory, and Happiness, and Safety.</p>

            <p>I shall add a few Caveats. 1. Take heed of a various management of matters of Religion, to the advantage of the present postures and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of your Civil Affairs. The things of Christ should be as <hi>Josephs</hi> Sheaf, to which all other should bow. When they are made to cringe and bend to mens Policies, they are no longer the things of Christ: All Gods Truths are Eternal and Unchangeable by men: Give them all at once the soveraignty of your Souls, and have not the least thought of making them bend to serve your worldly ends, but cleave to the Truth of the Precepts, and live by the Truth of the Promises; for
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:039179_0012_10141BF5D4AEB938"/>
performance whereof, the God of Truth hath engaged his Alsufficiency. 2. Take heed and beware that you deprive not any Instituted Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church, walking according to Gospel Rules, of the Power and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges which Christ hath purchased for them by his precious blood, and given unto them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 19. God calls Civil Rulers to protect and preserve such Churches; if he hath given them liberty, and you sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject them to bondage; if he hath given them power in their proper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments within themselves, and you countenance and uphold others to exercise power over the Churches, in such things to whom Christ ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gave such puwer; you will have a sad reckoning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Remember <hi>Jeptah's Argument,</hi> against the encroachments of the <hi>Amonites</hi> upon the Rights of <hi>Israel,</hi> Judg. 11. 14. 3.

Mens Opinions, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially when they are such as prevailed in an hour of Temptation, though consented to by the major part of a Topical Synod, yet disliked by some of themselves, and by other godly Ministers, both in this Countrey, and in other Countries, so that they are things Controverted and under Dispute. Impose not such things upon Churches, lest Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions arise in the Churches about Opinons, which are no part of the Faith once given to the Saints, for which we are called to contend ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly, <hi>Jude</hi> 3. 2. A standing Council, for which we find no warrant in the New-Testament, nor Example in the Primitive Churches, nor in Succeeding Ages, for some hundred years after Christ. Nor is it safe for the Churches, which are thereby subjected under an undue Power out of the Church, which under a pretence—of helping the Church with their Light, bereave them of their Power; <hi>in re propriâ,</hi> binding them to rest in their Decisions, and to practise accordingly. As for occasional Councils, two extreams must be avoided. 1. A total rejecting Councils: For, when the need of any Church requireth such helps, through want of Light, or of consent within it self, in weighty and difficult questions, it is their Liberty, and Prudence, and Duty, voluntarily to seek help from others chosen by that Church, being approved for their Orthodoxy, and Faithfulness to Christ, and to his Cause, and Interest; And when their Counsel i<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> given, it is the Duty of the said Church to try it by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and if it be found to agree with the Oracles of God, to acquiesce in it, else not; according to that Rule, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 21. 2. A preferring the Judgment of a Council when it suits? with mens own minds, wills, and ends, above any Light for the contrary, though it he held forth from the Word of God, so as to rest in what the Council saith, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering whether it be according to the holy Mind and Will of God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared

in the Scriptures. This is an abuse of Councils, which hath sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Pens of Godly Learned men in their Writings against it, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against Popish Councils, which bind People to receive their Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Devices and Impositions, as matters of Faith; but against other Councils, which have too peremptorily and absolutely obtruded their own Determinations without Scripture-proof. Hence <hi>Luther</hi> affirmed of the first general Council at <hi>Nice</hi> (which was accounted the best) That he understood not that the Holy Ghost speak in it; and that the Canons and Articles thereof, were but Hay, and Straw, and Stubble. And <hi>Beza</hi> (in his Preface to the New-Testament) saith, That such was the folly, ignorance, and ambition of many Bishops, in the best times, that you would have supposed the Devil to have been President in their Assemblies. And, long before these, <hi>Nazianzen</hi> complained, That he never saw good end of any, and resolved never to come at them more; yet he lived under the good Emperour <hi>Theodosius.</hi> When Councils seek to please themselves and other men, more then to serve Christ, their Conclusions will be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to their scope. Hence the German Interim was agreed upon by sundry Ministers to please the Emperour, but other Orthodox Ministers dissented, and wrote against it. The Synod in <hi>England,</hi> under the Prelacy, published Superstitious Ceremonies; against which many god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learned Ministers wrote, and were silenced; who are, to this day, called, <hi>The good Old Nonconformists:</hi> The late Reverend Teacher, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establish a Church, published a Catechism for the Children of it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he taught them concerning the Power of Councils; that the Question is carried to the Council, but the Cause still remaineth in and with the Church. This shall suffice, for the present, to have been spoken to the Care that the Honourable Court is to Exercise about the <hi>things of God.</hi> The next things to be spoken to briefly, are the things of men; they are righteous Administrations of Justice in matters of this Life. These wheels also you are to set going. 1. If upon revisal of your Body of Laws any one be found to be unjust and oppressing, let it be expunged, and altered; And for those that are good, provide for good execution. 2. Let the soveraign Dictates of Nature, be constantly <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ended by you, which Christ notes to be the sum of all Moral Duties, in the two Tables, <hi>Quod tibi furi non vis, alteri ne faeceris,</hi> Mat. 7. 12. Would you enjoy peace and liberty in Professing and Practising according to the Rules of the Word, as you are perswaded; let others also that fear God, and walk orderly and just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and peaceably with them, enjoy the like Peace and Civil Liberties, lest other Rulers be encouraged by your Example, to measure to us again, with what measure we mete unto others, they accounting, as we do them.

This is threatned in <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 2. I shall conclude with a brief reminding you of the first beginning of this Colony of the <hi>Massachusets,</hi> which I have the better advantage, and more special engagement to do; being one of them, by whom the Patent, which you enjoy, was procured; and to whom it was committed, by King <hi>Charles</hi> the first, and His Majesties most Honorable Privy Council. My Name was not mentioned in the Patent, because I desired it might be left out, lest the then Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> who was of the Privy Council, should have an ill eye upon me for my appearing so far in that work, whereunto he was opposit: but in expences for any Helps to promove the Work, in the first beginnings of it, I bore my part, meerly for the service of Christ, and for the help of his People, I not knowing that ever I should remove unto these parts, by vertue of that Patent. When it was obtained, and committed to us, we were made a Corporation for <hi>New-England,</hi> and accordingly acted, in sundry Meetings, and chose Mr <hi>Endicot</hi> to be the first Governor, and sent him hither; and for his encouragement, we gave him an House at <hi>Salem,</hi> which was built for the use of the Corporation in <hi>London;</hi> and he carried with him two Ministers. The next year the Corporation in <hi>London,</hi> understanding that honorable Mr <hi>Winthrope,</hi> inclined to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move himself and family to <hi>New-England</hi> chose him to be Governor, who came to <hi>Boston,</hi> and with him we sent the Patent, to prevent future inconveniencies; and God blessed it to that end, as it appeared soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward. In the first General Court, after his Arrival, the Civil Order was settled in a Select Company of Free Planters, such as were accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted most fit to manage public Trust, to Christ's Ends; these choose a Governour, and Deputy-Governour, and a limited number of Assistants, invested with Magistratical Power, and Deputies from the respective Plantations, according to the Patent, which gave liberty to order Civil Affairs, as they found best. Churches also were gathered in a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational way, and walked therein, according to the Rules of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, with much peace and consent among themselves, which that now blessed Servant of Christ, Mr <hi>John Cotton,</hi> the first Teacher to this Church, so approved, that he wrote unto me, being then in <hi>Holland,</hi> to encourage my coming to <hi>New-England,</hi> that the Order of the Churches and of the Commonwealth was so settled, by common Consent; that it brought to his mind, the New Heaven and New Earth, wherein dwells Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, advising me to come hither free from Engagements to others. But Satan, in a short time, stir'd up Strifes and Dissentions, to the great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance of the Churches and of the Countrey, which God at last mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully quieted; not hath the Gospel come unto you empty handed, out

hath brought unto you in its right-hand, Spiritual Good Things, through Jesus Christ, with Eternal Salvation to those that believe in him; And in its less hand, Riches, and Honour, with Protection and Deliverances from Enemies of all sorts. Now therefore take heed and beware, that the Lord may not have just cause to complain of us, as he did of those in <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 21. &amp; <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 4. lest you lose by Gods punishing Justice, what you received from his free Mercy, lest he remove the golden Candle-sticks, and the burning and shining Lights in them, as he hath already done many eminent Lights; and wo to them from whom the Gospel is removed, for their abusing it, and the Messengers of it. Would you yet fee good dayes, and enjoy good things as in times past? They the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel that the Spirit gave to the Church at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> Rev. 2. 5. And to the Angel of the Church in <hi>Sardis,</hi> Rev. 3. 2, 3. And take the course that <hi>Jehoshaphat</hi> took, and was blessed therein, and all <hi>Judah</hi> with him. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17. 3. The Lord was with <hi>Jehoshaphat,</hi> because he walked in the first wayes of his Father <hi>David:</hi> And see that your fruitfulness in good, answereth the cost &amp; pains that God hath been at with you in his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, lest the Lord be provoked to deal with us, as he did with his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Vineyard, <hi>Isa.</hi> 5. from the first to the eight verse.</p>
