            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

money, and in which we may be greatly injured by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them a power in, or to direct about. Suppose the parliament of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> should undertake to prohibit us from walking in the streets and highways on certain saints days, or from being abroad after a certain time in the evening, or (to come nearer to the matter) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain us from working up and manufacturing materials of our own growth, would not our liberty and property be as much affected by such regulations as by a tax act? It is the very spirit of the constitution that the King's subjects sháll not be governed by laws, in the making of which they had no share; and this principle is the great barrier against tyranny and oppression. If this bulwark be thrown down, nothing will remain to us but a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful expectation of certain slavery. If any acts of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> parliament are found suitable and commensurate to the nature of the country, they may be introduced, or adopted, by special acts of our own parliaments, which would be equivalent to making them anew; and without such introduction or adoption, our allowance of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity or force of <hi>any</hi> act of the <hi>English</hi> or <hi>British</hi> parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in these dominions of the King, must and will ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate as a concession on our part, that our fellow subjects in another country can choose a set of men among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and impower them to make laws to bind us, as well in the mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ly proved, and is a point not to be contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, that in our constitution the having of property, especially a landed estate, entitles the subject to a share in government and framing of laws. The <hi>Americans</hi> have such property and estate, but are not, and never can be represented in the <hi>British</hi> parliament. It is therefore clear that that assembly cannot pass <hi>any</hi> laws to bind us, but that we must be governed by our own parliaments, in which we can be in person, or by representation.</p>
            <p>BUT of late a new system of politics hath been adopted in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and the <hi>common people</hi> there claim a sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty over us although they be only fellow subjects. The more I consider the nature and tendency of this

               </gap>lery ware, they cease not to make laws injurious to us; and whenever we expostulate with them for so doing, all the return is a discharge of threats and menaces.</p>
            <p>IT is now an established principle in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> that we are subject to the <hi>people</hi> of that country, in the same manner as they are subject to the Crown. They express<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call us their subjects. The language of every paultry scribler, even of those who pretend friendship for us in some things, is after this lordly stile, <hi>our colonies—our wes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern dominions—our plantations—our islands—our subiects in America—our authority—our government</hi>—with many more of the like imperious expressions.

It is enough to break every mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of patience, that fellow subjects should assume such power over us. They are so possessed with the vision of the plenitude of their power, that they call us rebels and traitors for denying their authority. If the King was an absolute monarch and ruled us according to his absolute will and pleasure, as some kings in <hi>Europe</hi> do their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, it would not be in any degree so humiliating and debasing, as to be governed by one part of the Kings sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects who are but equals. From every part of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the administration, from the acts, votes, and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of the parliament, and from all the political wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings in that country, and libels on <hi>America,</hi> this appears to be their claim, which I think may be said to be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion of the rights of the King, and an unwarrantable combination against the liberties of his subjects in <hi>America.</hi>

            <p>THE <hi>common people</hi> of <hi>Great Britain</hi> very liberally give and grant away the property of the <hi>Americans</hi> without their consent, which if yielded to by us must fix us in the lowest bottom of slavery: For if they can take away one penny from us against our wills, they can take all. If they have such power over our properties they must have a proportionable power over our persons; and from hence it will follow, that they can demand and take away our

lives, whensoever it shall be agreeable to their sovereign wills and pleasure.</p>
            <p>THIS claim of the commons to a sovereignty over us, is founded by them on their being the <hi>Mother Country.</hi> It is true that the first emigrations were from <hi>England</hi>; but upon the whole, more settlers have come from <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Germany,</hi> and other par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Would it not be thought strange if the commonalty of the <hi>Massachusetts-Bay</hi> should require our obedience, because this colony was first settled from that dominion?

If this doctrine of the maternal authority of one country over another be a little examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it will be found to be the greatest absurdity that ever entered into the head of a politician — In the time of <hi>Nimrod,</hi> all mankind lived to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is to be hoped that in fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ounds without meaning.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER grievance to be considered, is the alarming attempt o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the peop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of <hi>Old England</hi> to restrain our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures. This country abounds in iron, yet there is
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010886_0011_0F86CC390D8C9508"/>
an act of parliament, passed in the late King's reign to restrain us from manufacturing it into plates and rods by mill-work, the last of which forms are absolutely necessary for the making of nails, the most useful article in a new country that can be conceived.—Be astonished all the world, that the people of a country who call themselves Christians and a civilized nation, should imagine that any principles of policè will be a sufficient excuse, for their prohibiting their fellow subjects in a distant part of the earth from making use of the blessings of the GOD of nature! There would be just as much reason to prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit us from spinning our wool and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ax, or making up our cloaths. Such prohibitions are infractions on the natural rights of men, and are utterly void.</p>
            <p>THEY have undertook, at the distance of three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand miles, to regulate and limit our trade with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives round about us, and from whom our lands were purchased—a trade which we opened ourselves, and which we ought to enjoy unrestricted. Further, we are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by a people, who never set foot here from making any more purchases from the <hi>Indi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns,</hi> and even of settling those which we have made. The truth is, they intend to take into their own hands the whole of the back lands, witness the patents of immense tracts continually sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited, and making out to their own people. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence will be shocking, and we ought to be greatly alarmed at such a procedure. All new countries ought to be free to settlers; but instead thereof every settler on these patent lands, and their descendants forever, will be as compleat slaves to their landlords, as the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Poland</hi> are to their lords.</p>
            <p>A standing army in time of profound peace is cantoned and quartered about the country to awe and intimidate the people—Men of war and cutters are in every port, to the great distress of trade. In time of war we had no sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ships, but were obliged to protect our trade, but now in time of full peace, when there are none to make us afraid we are visited with the plague of men of war, who commit all manner of disorders and irregularities;
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010886_0012_0F86CC39BB7B0D00"/>
and behave in as hostile a manner as if they were open and declared enemies. In open defiance of civility, and the laws of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> which they profess to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by, they violently seize and forcibly carry on board their ships the persons of the King's loving subjects. What think ye my brethren, of a military government in each town?—Unless we exert ourselves in opposition to their plan of subjecting us, we shall all have soldiers quartered about upon us, who will take the absolute command of our families. Centry boxes will be set up in all the streets and passages, and none of us will be able to pass, without being brought too by a soldier with his fixed bayonet, and giving him a satisfactory account of ourselves and business. Perhaps it will be ordered that we shall put out fire and candle at eight of the clock at night, for fear of conspiracy. From which fearful calamities may the GOD of our fathers deliver us!</p>
            <p>BUT after all, nothing which has yet happened ought to alarm us more then their suspending government here, because our parliaments or assemblies (who ought to be free) do not in their votes and resolutions please the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulace of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> Suppose a parcel of mercenary troops in <hi>England</hi> should go to the parliament house, and order the members to vote as they directed under pain of dissolution, how much liberty would be left to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In short, this dissolving of government upon such pretences as are formed, leaves not the semblance of liberty to the people.—We all ought to resent the treatment which the <hi>Massachusetts-Bay</hi> hath had, as their case may soon come to be our own.</p>
            <p>We are constantly belied and misrepresented to our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious sovereign, by the officers who are sent hither, and others who are in the cabal of ruining this country. They are the persons who ought to be called rebels and traitors, as their conduct is superlatively injurious to the King and his faithful subjects.</p>
            <p>MANY other grievances might be enumerated, but the time would fail.—Upon the whole, the conduct of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> shews that they have formed a plan to subject us
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010886_0013_0F86CC3C4288C9D8"/>

               </gap> freedom of speech will be taken from us. This plan they are executing as fast as they can; and almost every day produces some effect of it.
