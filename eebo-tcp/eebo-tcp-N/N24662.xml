            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>SENSIBLE that every attempt at improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in any of the uſeful arts, ever has, and probably ever will meet with oppoſition, either from intereſted or <hi>certain</hi> other motives, which in a greater or leſs degree in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence the generality of mankind,—the ſubſcriber takes the liberty to cite a few among very many caſes in which his method of removing pains, inflammations, and ſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modic affections from the human body, has been attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſucceſs. The novelty and apparent ſimplicity of this practice, may poſſibly induce ſome, before they have attended with candor to the ſubject, to treat it with ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule. That the public may be more ſatisfactorily infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as to its utility and importance, he publiſhes the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing certificates, as received from ſeveral reſpectable characters.</p>

               <p>I JOHN TYLER, of Preſton, in the country of New-London and State of Connecticut, hereby certify, that on or about the 17th day of June laſt, I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by a <hi>Wound,</hi> which I had before that time receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by <hi>cutting my right leg tranſverſely,</hi> in which I had taken cold; and at that time the ſore was in a high ſtate of inflammation, and gave me great pain, to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree that I had been obliged to keep my leg in a hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal poſition, in a chair, the moſt of that day,—when Doct. <hi>Eliſha Perkins,</hi> of Plainfield, called on me, and having operated on me a few minutes with his patent metallic inſtruments, the pain in my leg wholly ceaſed, and the redneſs and inflammation of the wound entirely diſappeared. I was free from pain that night, and indeed the pain and inflammation both ceaſed from that opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and never returned again.</p>
               <p>And I further certify, that my wife at that time was ſorely afflicted with rheumatic pains in her hip, which had been upon her a number of years, and had affected her to ſuch a degree as to render that ſide ſhorter than the other, and to make her unable at that time to raiſe herſelf from her chair without the greateſt difficulty, or to walk acroſs the room without learning on her ſtaff, and with that ſupport, not without the greateſt inconvenience; and Doct. <hi>Perkins</hi> operated upon her a few minutes, when ſhe declared herſelf free from pain, and immediately roſe from her chair, without any aſſiſtance or apparent difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and walked ſeveral times acroſs the room without her

ſtaff, or any other ſupport, and has continued to this time able to walk in that manner; not having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of, or been troubled with pain in the night (of which ſhe had much complained before;) and has truly been to all appearance, a different perſon, as to the uſe of her limbs, from the time of that operation, from what ſhe had been for years before.</p>

               <p>I NATHAN GLOVER, of Plainfield, in the county of Windham and ſtate of Connecticut, certify, that for ſeven years paſt, I have been frequently viſited with ſevere turns of the <hi>Quinſey,</hi> which (notwithſtanding the application of internal and external means, adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the moſt ſkilful neighboring phyſicians) have never leſt me within eight or ten days.</p>
               <p>About the firſt of July, 1796, I was again ſeverely at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked by this diſeaſe, and in about twenty-four hours, my throat became very much ſwelled and inflamed, and extremely painful. I was at this time viſited by Doct. <hi>Perkins,</hi> who operated on the diſeaſed part, with his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent metallic inſtruments.</p>
               <p>The pains after two or three operations, wholly left me, and the inflammation entirely diſappeared; the ſwelling did not maturate and break as it had uſually done,—but in about twenty-four hours wholly ſubſided, and my throat became perfectly well.</p>

The turns of the Quinſey which I have heretofore had, through not more ſevere in their firſt attacks than this, have never left me ſhort of the term of eight or ten days; whereas this continued but two: And I have no doubt but it would have <hi>no doubt but it would have</hi> laſted as long as the others, had not Doct. <hi>Perkins</hi> operated with his inſtruments. I believe the cure to be effected whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be his means.</p>

               <p>I THE ſubſcriber was called on the 4th inſtant, to attend a patient, by the name of <hi>James Crawſon,</hi> who for the term of nearly five years, has been frequently
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:032669_0008_0FF401CBCC2B6AE0"/>
trouble with a <hi>ſpecies of epileptic fits.</hi>—When I firſt ſaw him, he had experienced in the courſe of the day, about twelve, each of which uſually held him nearly fifteen mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes. At the commencement of one of them, I took from him about fourteen ounces of blood; but diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering no happy effect, I applied Doctor <hi>Perkins'</hi> patent metallic inſtruments to his right leg, in which he uſually experienced the firſt attack of his fits. The whole leg immediately became limber and free from ſpſams, and he ſoon revived without ſuffering a general convulſion. About twenty minutes after, I being out of his room, was informed that the ſymptoms of another fit appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and before I could operate on him, he was univerſally convulſed with an entire loſs of reaſon. I then applied the inſtrument to his right leg, ſix or eight ſtrokes, when the ſpaſms immediately ceaſed, and he recovered his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. In a ſhort time, he was ſeized with another, which was removed very much in the manner of the laſt, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments not being applied until a general convulſion had taken place. I then ſeated myſelf on his bed, that I might be enabled to apply the means more ſeaſonably. Here I very ſoon diſcovered the ſymptoms again, but by applying the inſtruments, the ſymptoms immediately diſappeared. Several others at intervals, commenced with their uſual ſymptoms, by ſo contracting and cramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the right leg, that the utmoſt exertions of two men were ſcarcely able to ſtraighten it, each of which were, in leſs then a minute removed by five or ſix ſtrokes of the inſtruments, before they had extended to the other parts of the body, the leg almoſt inſtantaneouſly be coming perfectly lax.</p>
               <p>By the requeſt of a number of gentlemen, who were then preſent, when the ſymptoms of one appeared, I ceaſed to operate, that we might determine whether the above operations had prevented the general convulſions, which before the applications of the inſtruments, had always ſucceeded the firſt attack in his leg. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately he fell into a severe fit, which appeared in one uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſpaſm. In this ſituation, I ſuffered him to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue a few minutes, when by applying the inſtruments to
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:032669_0009_0FF401CEC87A1310"/>
his leg again, in leſs than one minute he was entirely free from any kind of ſpaſm, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately recovered his reaſon. I ſtill continued by his ſide, and prevented ſeveral other general attacks by opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the inſtruments at the beginning of the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms. About one hour and a half after the firſt opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the fits entirely ſubſided. He became eaſy and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced none of thoſe diſagreeable ſenſations, which he ever had after former attacks of this kind. He informs that he had uſually been afflicted with theſe fits except at a few intervals, about twenty four hours from the time they firſt commenced, and it is preſumed the application of the metallic inſtruments, not only ſhortened the fits, but leſſened their number, as at this time they continued not more than nine or ten hours from their firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement, and about an hour and a half after the firſt application of the inſtruments. He further obſerves, that he has diſcovered none of that debility which had univerſally ſucceeded his former attacks, and continues to this day enjoying better health than uſual.</p>

in my left ſhoulder. For the two laſt years it has gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally increaſed till it became very diſtreſſing, and has been attended with a ſtiffneſs, to ſuch a degree that I could not raiſe my hand to the top of my head without great difficulty. On or about the 18th June laſt, I myſelf o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated on my ſhoulder when it was in extreme pain, with Doctor <hi>Perkins's</hi> patent tractors.—The pain, to my great ſurpriſe, wholly left me within ſix minutes, and my ſhoulder was ſoon freed from its former ſtiffneſs, ſo that I could move that arm and ſhoulder with the ſame eaſe, that I could the other.—The pain has but once returned, and then very lightly, in conſequence of ſevere exerciſe: It was immediately removed by applying the tractors.</p>
               <p>I further certify, that I have been afflicted with a pain in my head for twenty years paſt. It has uſually come on in the fore part of the day, and continued ten or twelve hours. Has often been very diſtreſſing. About the time of the above operation. I applied the inſtruments to my head, when in ſevere pain.

               <p>UNTIL of late, I have not been eye witneſs to many operations, with your <hi>Metallic Points</hi>—one caſe which appeared to me a little ſingular, I will relate—A rough, hardy labourer had a <hi>very bad boil</hi> upon the outſide of his ancle—His leg was ſwollen to the knee, and his foot, to the toes, looked as tho' the ſkin was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to burſt—The leg up to the hip, he ſaid, was in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme pain, ſo that he was deprived of ſleep the night preceeding, and the foot was in a high ſtate of inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—I drew the inſtruments repeatedly up and down the leg, without any viſible effect or decreaſe of pain, ſo long that I was almoſt diſcouraged—at length however the patient pulled off his coat and flung it aſide—(It was one of thoſe cold nights the beginning of this month)—Upon obſerving his leg, it was of a ſudden wet, with ſweat—Indeed the ſweat burſt inſtantaneouſly from all his pores—The inflamation, upon the ſurface of the foot, ſubſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and the ſwelling abated—the man declared himſelf free from pain, went to bed and ſlept well, and I heard no further complaint—As I had never known of this ſweating effect being produced I thought the caſe worth reporting to you.<note n="*" place="bottom">

one John Patterſon.

neighbour to me. the wife of Eber Beers, and daughter of Capt. Samuel Huggins, of this town, had been, for fourteen weeks, exceedingly diſtreſſed with the Rheuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, to ſuch a degree, that for the laſt fourteen weeks, previous to the 29th of laſt month, ſhe had not been able to walk acroſs her room, even with crutches, ſave only once, when ſhe made out, with the aſſiſtance of crutches, to hobble part of the way acroſs her room.—On the 29th of September laſt ſhe procured a ſett of your Metallic Subſtances, and in leſs than an hour after ſhe had begun to uſe them, in the manner directed by you. ſhe roſe from her chair, and walked about her houſe, and on the next day ſhe went abroad to her neighbours, having thrown aſide her crutches. I have this day paid her a viſit, in company with her father, Timothy Jones, <abbr>Eſq,</abbr> who lives in the ſtreet where ſhe reſides and directly oppoſite to her reſidence, and with Capt. Abel Burrett, who is her next neighbour, and lives within eight yards of her door. I requeſted her to relate her caſe over in their preſence, which ſhe did; and theſe gentlemen all, with one voice, ſupported, from their own knowledge, her ſtory. It is a duty which you owe yourſelf and the world to promulge this event.</p>
