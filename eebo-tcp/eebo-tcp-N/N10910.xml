            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>SEVERAL Members of the General Assembly having declared, that the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Delegates, to meet in the next Continental Congress, had better come from the people, than from their House; they having drawn up a list of grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, similar to those contained in the proceedings of the Continental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress, and intending also to petition the King on our behalf; have left this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant matter to your nomination.â€”The Chairman, Mr. Isaac Low, with the unanimous voice of your Committee, have thought proper, to call you together on Monday next, to take your sentiments, on the best method of choosing such Delegates.</p>
            <p>You cannot be insensible of the many stratagems, made use of by the ministerial tools among us, <hi>To divide, and then destroy;</hi> as is evident in the hand bill, signed John Thurman, in which it appears, they have nothing else in view, than to postpone this important matter, until it will be too late to appoint any Delegates; for they would leave it until the 20th of April, from which delay, the time will be too short to take the sense of the counties on this subject, as there will then be but twenty days left, until the tenth of May, the day, on which the Continental Congress are to meet at Philadelphia.</p>
            <p>Rouze therefore, my dear Fellow Citizens! and spurn with indignation at their treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous purposesâ€”Their insinuation, that the day is too short, for your consideration, is an insult upon your understandings: All of our sister colonies, have already chosen their Delegates, and shall we delay concurring in a measure, that has been the subject of consideration, ever since the last Congress?</p>
            <p>You cannot be ignorant, that if we do not appoint Delegates, all the Colonies will, and must withhold their trade and connection from us; whereby, as our late respectable Delegates assert, we shall not only act a dishonourable part, but our debt due from them will remain unpaid; we shall be destitute of many necessaries which we now receive from them, and the next Congress may be induced to enter into Measures against u<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>, for our perfidy. <hi>In our Union, we have every thing to expect; in Disunion, Ruin and Destruction.</hi> I entertain not the smallest doubt, but on this day, you will discover to these Seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of court favours, that we are not to be cajoled out of our inestimable and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutional privileges,</hi> by such <hi>contemptible pretexts.</hi>â€”Consider who these people are, who thus darkly advise, and you will soon find their drift is to enslave this free and happy Country, in order to obtain Pensions and Places for themselves and sons. If ever we are taxed by a venal British Parliament, these very persons will be our tax-masters, whilst unhappy for us, we shall be little better than beasts of burthen; and, by the sweat of our brows, support them in luxury and iniquity.â€”And the severity of this more than cruel burthen, will be most heavy on the <hi>industrious poor.</hi> The eyes of all America are now upon us,â€”let us acquit ourselves like men, deserving the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cause for which we contendâ€”We have already chosen a respectable and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved <hi>Committee;</hi> as such, let us strenuously support them in the measures they have adopted, and frustrate the wicked attempts of our enemies.</p>
