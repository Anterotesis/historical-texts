            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Public will expect no apology for the preſent collection of theſe letters; for it is deciſive of their utility, that though the Rebels began, they have found it expedient to diſcontinue, the re-publication of them in their Gazettes.</p>
            <p>They made it a queſtion at firſt, whether Deane was the real author of them? and yet what is that to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, if they are ſound and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial? But this point is now ſettled— Not one of the perſone to whom they are directed, has ventured to deny his receipt of the duplicate; and their preſſes are pouring out abuſes upon their <hi>quondam</hi> Ambaſſador, as freely as of late againſt General Arnold, whom

<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:017509_0005_0FA12587AE887DA8"/>been inſtrumental in pulling down upon his countrymen.</p>
            <p>This collection of his epiſtles, is to aid him in the deſigns of his penitence for repairing if poſſible the miſchief he has done. Happy for America, if they are conducive to the opening the eyes of others, before their wicked ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers ſhall have compleated their vaſſalage to a crafty and arbitrary Monarchy! That they are not already in this gulph of perdition, is under God to be aſcribed, to the efforts of Great-Britain, in favour of her <hi>nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous</hi> friends in this country.</p>
            <p>Be it the conſolation of the ſuffering Loyaliſts, that no arts of their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors for concealing their numbers, to leſſen their conſequence, can at this day ſucceed.</p>

            <p>It is a proof that though the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering, they are the minor party, that they forbid the liberty of the preſs, and in the caſe of their own Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor's letters, dare not appeal to the underſtandings of the multitude; and it adds to the evidence, that ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſing pains are taken, to expreſs a joy and confidence, felt <hi>leaſt</hi> by thoſe who moſt promote the ſhew and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</p>
            <p>With the help of a few lying letters, thoſe Gazettes may perhaps influence the councils of Verſailles, and furniſh matter for factious oratory in England; certainly they cannot miſlead thoſe

                  </gap> France is unwilling, as appearances warrant ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, but when the conduct of men, or of a nation is capable of two conſtructions, I would willingly adopt the moſt favourab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But to which ever of theſe cauſes we impute the continuance of the war, in our country, the conſequences will be found
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:017509_0020_0FA125946FF5D8E8"/>equally pernicious to us. Great-Britain is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in no circumſtances to admit the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency of America, and ſo long as both parties remain inflexible, we ſhall continue to weaken, exhauſt and ruin each other, and who will eventually be the gainers? It is, I think time ***** for us to enquire how our account will ſtand on a cloſe. Let the conteſt cloſe, when or in what manner it may—Will independent ſovereignty, in the hands of a democracy, be a government under which our perſons and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will be better ſecured than they were before this unhappy conteſt began?—Will our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce flouriſh more under independency, than it did whilſt we were connected with Great Britain? This I know is generally believed, it is even relied on, as a principal ſource from which we ſhall reimburſe our preſent expences.—The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject however merits an examination.—If the reſtraints formerly laid on our trade were overbalanced by the protection and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given to it. If in a ſtate of independence, that protection and encouragement muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be withdrawn, and our commerce with Great-Britain and its poſſeſſions, become ſubject to all the duties and prohibitions laid on the commerce of other aliens and ſtrangers.

<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017509_0021_0FA12596C1F79210"/>ſhall become gainers or not. I have exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the queſtion as thoroughly as I am ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, and am convinced we muſt be loſers. We complained of England for including America in the Navigation Act, and other acts of trade, but if the naval force of that nation roſe in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of thoſe acts, into a power ſufficient to protect the trade of the whole empire; if the trade of America was protected thereby, could it be unreaſonable that the trade of America ſhould ſubmit to thoſe acts and regulations which were the ſource of its protection and ſecurity? We complained that acts of parliament prohibited us from carrying certain articles of our produce to foreign markets, and thereby gave England a monopoly advantageous to her and injurious to us; but it muſt at the ſame time be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that Britiſh ſubjects were generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from purchaſing and importing the ſame articles from other countries; ſo that if England made a monopoly of certain articles of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, ſhe gave us in return a monopoly of her market, and the liberty of re-exporting our goods if a better market afforded elſewhere; in this, the advantage ay evidently with us; a great part of the articles thus monopolized by Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, were ſuch as could have been, and were formerly ſupplied by foreigners at as low or lower rates than we could afford them. But the ſyſtem of Great-Britain being as you know to promote the commerce of her own empire in every part
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:017509_0022_0FA1259773948B48"/>of it, not only reſtraints and duties were laid on foreign importations, but bounties given to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the growth and importation of many of our productions, which otherwiſe would not have found their way to Europe; another complaint was, that we were prohibited the taking from fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, articles, which we wanted though not the growth or fabric of England; but it is well known that thoſe articles concerning which ſo much has been ſaid, formed but a very inconſiderable part of our commerce.— Every one who has had an opportunity of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the manufactures of one nation in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope with another, of obſerving the different modes and principles of tranſacting buſineſs, will at once give England and her merchants the preference. All the more ſolid, ſubſtantial and uſeful articles are made better, and afforded cheaper there, than any where elſe, certain linens from Ruſſia and Sileſia excepted—and even thoſe as well as the leſs important foreign articles, came to us, conſidering the drawbacks in England on exportation, nearly, if not quite as cheap, as we could have imported them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly. But it has been alſo objected that fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners were not admitted to bring their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce and merchandize into our ports, and trade with us; of all the complaints made by us on the ſubject of comme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I believe that others as well as myſelf, had at that time but partially examined the ſubject, and in truth we know that too many of our leading pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots had little or no knowledge of commerce, its intereſts and dependencies.—I confeſs that on a more extenſive view, and impartial exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the ſubject, I think it evident that the reſtrictions which were laid on our commerce previous to the preſent diſpute were over-ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced by the protection, and various encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements afforded to it by Great-Britain, but ſuppoſing that at the cloſe of the war America
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:017509_0024_0FA12599AD98B6D8"/>remain independent, what muſt be the future ſituation of our commerce? Will independency at the reſtoration of peace, give commerce ſuch a ſpring, procure for it ſuch new ſources and encouragements as are neceſſary, not only to revive it from the ruined ſtate in which it now is, but to raiſe it ſtill higher than it has been at any former period? Or will independency prove prejudicial to the commerce of America? This is a ſerious queſtion, and the importance of it muſt apologize for the length of my letter. I know that I am writing to the firſt commercial character in America, but I alſo know your candor and love of truth, and therefore I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to communicate to you my thoughts on the ſubject, which if juſt you will approve, if erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous you will correct. America left at liberty will, I am perſuaded, take at the leaſt, three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourths of all the European articles ſhe wants from Great-Britain. The ſuperiority of the Britiſh manufactures, their conformity to our taſte and habits; the generoſity and ſtrict punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of her merchants, and above all the credit which they can give, and which no other nation can, or will give, muſt ſecure to that nation, as great a ſhare of our trade as I have mentioned. But how are we to pay for thoſe purchaſes? Whilſt we were part of the empire, Great-Britain gave a preference to our iron, naval ſtores, pot aſh, flax ſeed, timber, &amp;c. &amp;c. and encouraged the importation of them by bounties,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017509_0025_0FA1259A6F3FA078"/>and by laying heavy duties on the ſame articles from foreign nations. This will no longer be the caſe; we have no reaſon to expect to be even amongſt the moſt favoured foreign nations in the Britiſh ports. We have imagined that Great-Britain would not ſupport its commerce, and manufactures, without our productions and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our markets for a conſumption of theirs; this has been aſſerted, in harangues and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations many thouſands of times within ſeven years paſt, I confeſs, that I once believed it— but obſervation and experience have convinced me, that we have been greatly miſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ken.—Of all the articles furniſhed by us to Great-Britain, I know but two, tobacco and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ce, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be obtained as good and as cheap from other countries. The conſumption of rice in Great-Britain, is very inconſiderable; and that of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, does not exceed twenty thouſand hogſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads annually, on an average.—Other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries indeed can produce both theſe articles at as low a price as America can, but the preference given to them from America by Great-Britain, has formerly prevented their being cultivated to any extent.—It is well known that the Iſland of Cuba, the Coaſt of Brazil, and many other countries produce tobacco of a quality ſuperior to ours.—That the Ukraine is capable of ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Europe with that article: its cultivation it is true is not yet carried to perfection there, but as it is, Ruſſia at this time exports large
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:017509_0026_0FA1259B363D3D18"/>quantities of tobacco to France, and to other nations.—The ſame may be ſaid of many other countries reſpecting rice. Indigo is produced in the Southern parts of America, and in the Iſlands, every way ſuperior to ours.—The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of Ruſſia, Denmark and Sweden, &amp;c. are the ſame with ours, and in exchange for them, thoſe kingdoms take the ſame kind of merchandize from England as we formerly took; at beſt therefore we ſhall meet with rivals in the Britiſh markets on our arrival with our produce, and rivals in the purchaſes we wiſh to make there—But we are ſuppoſed to be Independent, and can therefore go where we pleaſe, but we cannot find purchaſers where we pleaſe, and the nations among whom we find them may lay what impoſitions they pleaſe on our ſales—The North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern powers in Europe cannot become purchaſers for they have the ſame articles to ſell—France wants but a very ſmall part of our productions; it wants neither our iron, pot-aſh, flax ſeed, fiſh, oil, or in ſhort, ſcarcely any thing except about 24000 hogſheads of our tobacco, annually—Our timber and naval ſtores; and for the two latter articles, we ſhall find the ſame rivals in the ports of France as in England; and in regard to the firſt, the moſt important article of all, the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation of it advances ſo rapidly in Flanders, and in the Ukraine, that thoſe countries will ſoon rival us in the quality of their tobacco, and from the cheapneſs of labour, be able at

Our commerce in this moſt important branch of it muſt therefore be confined
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:017509_0032_0FA125A2B4B23818"/>to the ſupplying the French, Dutch, and other foreign iſlands and ſettlements, with ſuch articles as they will conſent to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It was the intereſt and policy of Great-Britain to promote our commerce and fiſheries, whilſt we were part of the empire; accordingly ſhe encouraged our ſhip building by the purchaſe of our ſhips, or by giving them freights; but being independent, the reverſe will become both her intereſt and policy towards us; her ports will be entirely ſhut againſt us in the Weſt-Indies, for the reaſons already given, and our commerce in that important branch confined, as I have ſhewn, to the furniſhing the French, Dutch, and other foreign ſettlements, with ſuch articles as they ſhall conſent to receive, and under ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions as they ſhall ſee fit to impoſe, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn they will give us molaſſes, if they pleaſe,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:017509_0033_0FA125A370D2A840"/>free of duty. But their ſugar, coffee, cotton, &amp;c. will ever remain prohibited articles ſo long as thoſe nations are intereſted to make a mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poly of theſe articles in Europe, both on account of commerce and revenue, and it is impoſſible they can be intereſted to do otherwiſe; when France was in poſſeſſion of Canada, Louiſbourg, &amp;c. the government did not permit thoſe colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to receive ſugar, coffee, or any of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of thoſe iſlands direct from them, but obliged thoſe colonies to take them from France, charged with double freights, duties, &amp;c. and can we expect that France will do for us what ſhe ever refuſed to do for her own ſubjects? That ſhe will grant us privileges which ſhe never granted to any other nation? Can we expect that Great-Britain, reſentful on account of her loſſes, and deſirous of encouraging the colonies which may remain to her in America, and which will be able to ſupply her iſlands with every thing, can we expect that ſhe will permit us to trade with thoſe iſlands on any terms? It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to common ſenſe to ſuppoſe it. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, you may remember ſpent ſome months in debate about the fiſheries, they acted the parts of the hunters who quarrelled about the bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkin—for England in the mean time drove our Allies, as well as us, entirely out of them; nor can France regain any intereſt in the fiſheries, but by the ſacrifice of ſome advantage which ſhe has, or may hereafter gain. But how are we to
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:017509_0034_0FA125A4318769B0"/>come in for any ſhare in them? It will be to no purpoſe to plead that our local ſituation gives us a natural right to participate, and that we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed that right from our firſt ſettlement, &amp;c.— We enjoyed it is true, that right with many others, as ſubjects and part of the Britiſh empire, but we have ſeparated from it and appealed to the ſword; the ſword has decided againſt us on that ſubject, and ſhall we at the peace have any thing to give or reſtore to Great-Britain, equal to the purchaſe of what that nation is almoſt as jealous of as Spain is of her mines? Will France after having regained a ſhare in the fiſheries for herſelf, go ſtill further to obtain an intereſt in them for us? Look-into the treaty between us, and you will find that France and we acted a little like the hunters I have referred to, in our diviſion of Newfoundland and the fiſheries; but it was made on condition of a conqueſt of them by either or both of us; that failing, France is under no obligation to guaranty any part of them to us; and what puts the matter out of all queſtion is, that it is not for their intereſt that America have any ſhare in the fiſheries. —Deprived of theſe, and of almoſt all the Weſt-India trade, wholly excluded from that of Africa, as well as from the benefit of ſelling our iron, pot-aſh, flax-ſeed, timber, naval ſtores, indigo, &amp;c. advantageouſly in Great-Britain and Ireland, with few or no markets opened for thoſe commodities, what reſources

In taking a view of the Weſt India commerce, I have ſaid nothing in particular of the Spaniſh, Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe, or Daniſh ſettlements in America. I think you will agree with me, that as the two former have ever been, and moſt probably will remain ſhut againſt all ſtrangers, nothing can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from thence, and that as to the latter, they are too inconſiderable to merit particular attention even were they not nearly in the ſame predicament, with thoſe of France and Holland, which you know them in truth to be.</p>
               <p>Theſe external difficulties, appear to me to be of themſelves inſurmountable, but they are not all we ſhall have to encounter, if we ſhould, contrary to all probability, continue indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent—Without a marine force, our commerce will be every where expoſed to impoſition and inſult, and we ſhall not probably be able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a marine—In truth neither our friends, nor

Our national debt, conſidering our ability will be immenſe, and we ſhall not eaſily agree in apportioning of it, to the ſeveral ſtates.

You, who are perfectly acquainted with the diſpoſition of thoſe who form the Congreſs and the Aſſemblies of the ſeveral ſtates, know that it is very far from being favourable to commerce; their views are ſo contracted, that they never have ſeen that agriculture and commerce mutually depend on, and ſupport each other. The reſolutions of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in almoſt every inſtance, demonſtrate their ignorance of the principles and effects of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce; the non-exportation agreement (for which I muſt blame myſelf as well as others) was a fatal meaſure; it laid the ax to the root of our commerce, and our agriculture fell with it; that reſolution ſhews what extravagant ideas we then had of our importance, we flattered ourſelves that by ſhutting our ports, we ſhould diſtreſs Great-Britain and Ireland, and ſtarve the Weſt-Indies, ſo far as to effect our purpoſes, but the operation of that reſolve well nigh ſtarved our army, and the poorer people, and brought diſtreſs to the doors of every order; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily but too many of our leaders are ſtill buoyed up with the ſame wild and groundleſs ideas, and when I hear men, reputed as the wiſeſt and moſt enlightened of American patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots, advance that commerce is rather injurious, than beneficial and that it would be better to have foreigners who want our produce, to come
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:017509_0038_0FA125A97160A7D0"/>and purchaſe it, than for us to carry it to them. That the whole attention of America as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent nation, ſhould be turned to agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the manufacturing of articles of the firſt neceſſity. When I hear ſuch doctrines ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, and by men whom America has been taught to look up to revere, and reviewing at the ſame time the other circumſtances which I have touched on, I become doubtful, whether our commerce would not ſuffer as greatly from internal checks and embarraſſments, as from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ones—but, my dear Friend, we are very far from the peaceable eſtabliſhment of indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, ſo far, that I candidly tell you, that I think there is not any probability of its ever taking place, at leaſt in our day. The nations of Europe, France excepted, are all of them againſt it, and none more ſo than Spain, France becomes every day more indifferent to it, but ſo long as we can be made their inſtruments for humbling Great Britain, Spain will temporize, and France will appear to be in earneſt on the ſubject; we are certainly the cheapeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments they can find to employ full one half of the forces of Great-Britain; forces, which if left at liberty to fall on their foreign poſſeſſions, would ſoon reduce them to the ſtate they were in 1762.

               <p>THE appointment of an Ambaſſador to the Empreſs of Ruſſia, has led me to make ſome ſerious reflections on the idea which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs entertain of their own importance in the commercial and political world; they appear to be perſuaded that every nation in Europe, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land excepted, are intereſted to have us inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, and though they have been told the contrary by every Power they have applied to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept France, yet the flattering deluſion conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, and a Miniſter Extraordinary has been ſent to Ruſſia. The fact is, that there is not one Power in Europe, except France, intereſted in having us independent, and by much the greater part are intereſted againſt us; the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of Germany, and King of Pruſſia, not
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:017509_0041_0FA125ABACE5FCF0"/>being commercial Powers, can be very little affected either way; Holland, and all the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Powers, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

It is to the leſt degree abſurd to ſuppoſe that Court can be ſo blind to the conſequences which muſt ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult from ſuch an event; whilſt we continue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on Great Britain, and under its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul, Spain will have nothing to dread ſo long as it continues to be on good terms with the Court of London, and the European connections and alliances of Spain, will ſerve to prevent that Court from wantonly breaking with Spain; but
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:017509_0042_0FA125AC6CD94ED8"/>North-America freed from all European con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul, will be at liberty to break with Spain at any time, without diſturbing the peace of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, or intereſting any of its powers in the quarrel; the family connection between the Courts of France and Spain, and the deſire of revenge for her former loſſes, have led Spain into a war, but it is evident that the Court of Spain, will not on any conſiderations make the war a common cauſe with us.—America out of the queſtion, Great Britain is greatly ſuperior to France and Spain united; this France and Spain are ſenſible of, and therefore give us good words and encourage us on, that England may be weakened by our expence; France has acted openly it is true, but the aſſiſtance afforded us from time to time has been calculated, not to drive the Britiſh forces from the continent, but to keep us from accommodating, and to employ their enemy with us. Spain has given us a triſling aid in money, but in the moſt ſecret manner, more like a bribe than a ſubſidy. The other Southern Powers, are not in any reſpect intereſted in our dependence or independence, but are perfectly indifferent as to either, nor if they ſhould intereſt themſelves would it be of the leaſt conſequence. But you may ſay, France having valuable poſſeſſions in the Weſt-Indies, ought on the general principle which I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, to fear the conſequences of our inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence.—Not at all.—The poſſeſſions of
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:017509_0043_0FA125AD2E4C3BE0"/>France from their being iſlands, can have nothing to apprehend from the independent ſovereignty of the United States.— France will at all times have a fleet ſufficient to protect them, and it can never be our intereſt to have any other concern with them than in the way of commerce—but our poſition with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Spain is different—Nothing but a river will ſeparate us, and the contrariety of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, manners, and habits are ſuch, that it is impoſſible, if left to ourſelves, that we ſhould live for any time in peace with each other.— Congreſs to induce Spain to declare and to act openly, have offered to cede the two Floridas— It is really no great act of generoſity to offer what is not our's, but ſuppoſe Spain accepts and gets poſſeſſion of them we ſhall thereby become ſtill nearer our neighbours, and quarrel ſo much the ſooner—Spain is not however, or appears not to be contented with this offer, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuates that Louiſiana ought to be thrown into the ſcale—on condition of her guaranting our independence. It is but too probable, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs will not even refuſe this, if they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that their independent ſovereignty can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be eſtabliſhed on eaſier terms But no man of ſenſe and knowledge in theſe affairs, can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that Spain is ſcrious in this demand, or that, that court means any thing elſe, by it than to gain time—Spain cannot be ignorant that from the day in which we become peaceably eſtabliſhed in Independent Sovereignty, ſhe muſt
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:017509_0044_0FA125ADEE2F49B8"/>look forward to the loſs of all her ſouthern pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces as an event certain, and not very diſtant; and ſhe muſt know, that though ſhe obtain Louiſiania, yet the Allegany, or weſtern moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, will be as inſufficient a barrier between us, as the river Miſſiſippi—I muſt tell you, that our Independence is ſpoke of in a very different ſtyle here, from what it was three years ſince, it is not viewed here in the light in which Congreſs ſpeak of it, when they ſay it is as fixt as fate (or if they mean any thing) as certain as thoſe eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nallaws of nature which Omnipotence itſelf can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not alter; on the contrary, it is conſidered by every ſenſible man here, as not only doubtfull, but the probability greatly againſt us: The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of American Independence are alſo eſtimated very diſterent from what they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in France—Experience has ſhewn, that our attachment to the Engliſh manners, cuſtoms, and to their manufactures, is ſuch, that if Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent and at liberty to trade where we pleaſe, England will have the preference; almoſt every American who arrives in France is impatient to get over to England, and the ſevere laws you are paſſing on that ſubject, may prevent their ever returning to America, during the war at leaſt; but it will not prevent their going over—The laws ordering confiſcation, &amp;c. demonſtrate more fully than any direct language is capable of, the predilection of Americans for England. France, though at war with England, permits her ſubjects to go to London openly and when
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:017509_0045_0FA125AEB04F4B58"/>they pleaſe, they taking out paſſports, and not a week paſſes but ſome of the citizens of Paris go over to London, and there are now more than four times the Engliſh goods conſumed in this city, than there were before the war; the better ſort of people here, both at court and in the city, are now become mad, as I may ſay, after every thing that is Engliſh, and even the ribbons worn by the ladies at court, are, in a great part, from Engliſh loems.</p>
               <p>I have been told that Monſ. Luzern remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated to Congreſs againſt our trading with Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, or purchaſing and importing its manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and that thoſe laws have paſſed in compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with his remonſtrances and requeſts; I am unwilling to believe it, for if true, we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and that voluntarily, greater ſlaves to France than its own ſubjects are. On whatever ground the laws have been paſſed, I venture to predict that not any one good effect will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by them, but the contrary—A little time will ſhew what ſucceſs Mr. Dana meets with at Ruſſia, but if he meets with any at all, I am greatly miſtaken—I know of no Power in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, Portugal only excepted, that is naturally and neceſſarily more in the Engliſh intereſt than Ruſſia—I hear that your ſpirits were greatly raiſed on hearing of the declaration of England againſt Holland; I expected it would be the caſe, though every thing conſidered there is not the leaſt ground for encouragement from that event, but the contrary—It is now more than
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:017509_0046_0FA125AF6E1AD758"/>four months ſince England commenced hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, yet the Dutch have made no repriſals, nor are they prepared to make any at this time. Nearly one half of the Republic are violently againſt a war with England on any conſiderations whatever—The views of England in declaring were to exclude Holland from the armed neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, to diſſolve at once a confederacy, which at beſt, could not have laſted any time, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive France and Spain of their naval ſupplies, furniſhed by the Dutch, and the French Iſlands of proviſions, by the ſame channels—The pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe has been effected—Ruſſia offers to mediate, but refuſes to take part with Holland; Denmark has in effect long ſince deſerted the confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the armed neutrality, on which I never built any hopes, is come to nothing.</p>
               <p>Before the arrival of Mr. Laurens, jun. France gave Dr. Franklin ſix millions of livres for the current year, it has ſince added four more, and as it is ſaid has engaged to be our ſecurity for 10 millions of livres in Holland, if to be borrowed at four per cent. You will be told therefore of 20 millions, and may poſſibly receive that ſum, but will that do more than prolong the war another year? Without a fleet ſuperior to that of England, nothing can be done to any purpoſe, as to finiſhing the war. I wiſh I could give you a more favourable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of affairs here, and ſuch as you wiſh to receive and credit, but I cannot do it conſiſtent with truth, and though you are certainly miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:017509_0047_0FA125B02E3FEF70"/>as to the face of affairs in Europe by men who are either ignorant of them, and who are reſolved at all hazards to write what they know you wiſh to believe, yet this will not juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify my doing the ſame. In a word, my friend, nothing ſhort of peace can ſave our country from ruin and ſlavery, and whatever you may think in America, I am convinced that the terms offered by Great-Britain afforded a good room to open a treaty on, and ought not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. This will not perhaps be a popular doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine at preſent, but it muſt be ſooner or later— for me, I have freely opened my mind to you, and though you may differ in ſentiment you will not, I truſt, condemn the motive for my having done it. I have long ſince had my accounts ready for ſettlement, and have been waiting here for ſix months paſt, on heavy expence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to get them audited, Mr. Johnſon, nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by Congreſs, as auditor, refuſed from the firſt to act, and Congreſs have not named any other, thus I am kept out of my money in a cruel and moſt unprecedented manner, but I will not add on the ſubject at this time. My com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments to all friends, and be aſſured that I am with much reſpect and friendſhip</p>

               <p>I HAVE not had the pleaſure of any letters from you ſince my leaving America, ſo that though I have written ſeveral, am uncertain of any of them coming to your hand, you doubtleſs muſt be as deſirous to know the true ſtate of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs on this ſide the water, as I am to know how things really are on yours,—the few letters I have received have been too ſhort, and written with too much caution to give me the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation I wiſh for, and the Americans who arrive run into ſuch extremes that I know not what to depend on. But a few weeks before the news of the defeat of Gen. Gates in Carolina, we were told by Mr. Searle, who arrived directly from Philadelphia, that the Britiſh were ſhut up, and in a manner beſieged in Charleſtown, that General Waſhington's army conſiſted of more than 20,000 men, &amp;c. others gave an account very different: In ſhort, nothing can be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory than the accounts given by the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent perſons, who arrive in France, of the ſtate of affairs in America. I wiſh you could find time and a ſafe opportunity to ſend me the truth, and the whole truth; I aſſure you it would be of ſervice, and tend to prevent the miſchiefs which flow from falſe and exaggerated accounts tranſmitted from America, and which are repaid with intereſt in the account ſent back to you of the ſtate of affairs in Europe. The writers and
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:017509_0049_0FA125B1AE246890"/>relaters of falſe accounts on both ſides the water, have done us infinite miſchief. The war itſelf was occaſioned at firſt more by them than by any other, or perhaps every other cauſe taken to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and the continuance of it has been equally owing to them; and in the beginning of the conteſt, the friends of the Britiſh miniſtry in America aſſured them, that America would not perſevere in its oppoſition, and our agents and correſpondents in London encouraged us, by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring us that the majority of the nation was in our favour, that government would not go to extremities, that Parliament would, and muſt recede, for that the nation was unable to make war, and to ſupport it for any time; thus falſe repreſentations on both ſides laid the foundation for the ſcenes which ſucceeded, and in which we are ſtill involved, and a continuation of the ſame kind of wrong and groundleſs information has kept up the action of this great tragedy of errors. You have found ſo many of the accounts tranſmitted you from Europe to have been groundleſs, and ſo many of the flattering encouragements and promiſes made you, diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear and vaniſh into air their original compoſition, that I preſume you would now bear to hear the truth at large, if I dared to ſend it you, and though it is hardly ſafe for me to do it, I dare not ſend you any thing elſe—Great-Britain is neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted nor diſpirited as you have been taught to believe, the Parliament appear more unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:017509_0050_0FA125B2702EEA48"/>and reſolved in the proſecution of the war, than at any former period, and the warmeſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of the Miniſter's unite with him in refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to accede to the Independence of America. The Britiſh fleet is evidently ſuperior at ſea to that of our ally, and the former are preparing to augment it by more than thirty new ſhips of the line, and near forty frigates, actually on the ſtocks—The late ſubſcription to the new loan, ſhews that money is not wanted though the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional debt is become immenſe; this is their fituation—The ſtate of our friends has been as greatly miſrepreſented in America, as that of our enemies—I will not enter into particulars but I think you cannot rely on either men or ſhips from hence, untill very late in this ſeaſon if at all—Monſ. de Graſſe has ſailed with about twenty ſail of the line for the Weſt-Indies, from whence, it is ſaid, he is ordered to America, but as Admiral Rodney has a fleet nearly equal in force, in the Iſlands, I ſee no proſpect of any thing deciſive ſhould ſuch a manoeuvre be made, and ſhould it take place, the French fleet cannot be with you before Auguſt, or later, and in theſe ſeas the maritime force of contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing powers appear too nearly balanced to expect any thing of importance from them this Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer—I am fully of opinion however, that Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land enters on this campaign with greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, than it has began any one ſince France joined in the war, and if they ſucceed in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:017509_0051_0FA125B333854138"/>the Emperor of Germany to interpoſe in their favour, I think the balance will be decidedly on their ſide. This will be known in a very ſhort time, poſſibly before I ſend on this letter— Our firſt object of the war was the repeal of thoſe acts of Parliament which were injurious to our rights and privileges; before this repeal was obtained we were forced to declare Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, and ſolicit an alliance with France, the hereditary enemy of England—By a fortunate turn of our affairs, France was brought into an alliance with us, and to guarranty our Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, juſt at this time the Parliament of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land repealed the obnoxious acts; this changed entirely the object of the war on our part as well as on that of England; it was no longer for the redreſs of grievances, but for ſovereignty that we fought; at the time in which France came into a treaty of alliance with us, their object was to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate America forever from England, and thereby to weaken effectually, a power which for centuries paſt, had given them more uneaſineſs and ſtood more in their way than any other power in Europe, from appearances they judged that by a ſudden declaration and vigorous exertions the point would be gained, in a very ſhort time, and at little expence, either of men or money; that England would be brought to conſent to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence of America, after which every thing elſe would follow of courſe, and in its proper time, but the firſt ſtroke failed, the favourable
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:017509_0052_0FA125B3EE32ACE8"/>moment was loſt, and all the preparations which had been made for improving it, ſerved only to ſhew England the danger it had been in, and to rouſe the ſpirit of the nation to make the moſt vigorous exertions. From this period the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the war became almoſt as much changed with France, as it had before been changed in America; at firſt, it was by a ſudden ſtroke to force England to acknowledge our independence and ſeparation from their empire, which being done, peace muſt have followed, and time will have ſoon effected the reſt; but this failing, the original object was changed, or rather it was thought beſt to obtain it, by taking a different line of conduct. England was loaded with debt, and was violently agitated by parties, the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to Miniſters in Parliament and out, was formidable, and it appeared more ſo than it really was, from the Engliſh freedom of ſpeech in Parliament, and of publications out of it; America was not perfectly unanimous in any of its meaſures, except <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But ſuppoſing that England in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of ſuch a ſyſtem, ſhould in two or three years be reduced to receive the law from France and Spain, in what ſituation muſt America by that time be? And to what Power can we look for relief, if France or Spain, or both, ſhould offer to dictate the laws to us? Though this may not be the caſe, yet nothing is more evident than

               <p>THE famous Abbe Raynall has publiſhed a new edition of his <hi>Hiſtoire Philoſophique &amp; Politique.</hi> The Parliament of Paris have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the book to be torn and burnt, his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be ſeized, and his eſtate confiſcated. The Abbe, however, had timely notice, and has fled. The Book is at preſent both ſcarce and dear, or I would ſend it to you. The liberties which the Abbe has taken with the Chriſtian Religion, and with the political manoeuvres of France, have cauſed his perſecution. I am of opinion that the latter has been the principal, for it is well known that no country in Europe abounds more in Deiſts and Deiſtical writers than this— As you muſt be anxious to know the ſentiments of this celebrated and eloquent writer with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to the American revolution, I have made a few extract, and would gladly oblige you with more if I had time, but having only borrowed the books, I muſt return them as ſoon as read, ſpeaking of our revolution he ſays.

For the grievances accumulated in the declaration of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency, amount to nothing, becauſe the firſt grievance—a queſtion nearly metaphyſical, was not ſufficient to juſtify a general commotion, and much leſs an inſurrection, for which a country is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold herſelf deprived of the hands that ſhould have been her ſupport, her harveſts ravaged, and her fields covered with the carcaſes of her relations, or ſtained with her own blood.</note>

               <p>I EXPECT by the time you receive this, you will hear me announced from letters, written by certain Americans on this ſide the water, as an enemy to my country; though I do not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine you will credit ſuch reports, yet I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded you intereſt yourſelf ſo much in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns me, that you will be glad to know what gave riſe to them.—Too many of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans who arrive in France, bring with them all

In Auguſt laſt I arrived here; Mr. Searle ſoon after me, that gentleman aſſerted that the Britiſh were ſhut up in Charleſtown, ſo that he ſaid <q>

                     <hi>until (ſaid he) that old Lion's claws ſhall be out, and his teeth all drawn.</hi>
                  </q> When any one doubted of theſe and ſuch like extravagant aſſertions, he was ſure to be anſwered with a moſt important air, <q>You muſt pardon me Sir, but I do know, for I am a Member of Congreſs, the only one that ever was in Europe in that quality, and I think I muſt know better than any other, having been Chairman of moſt of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees.</q>—Thoſe who from their perſonal knowledge were able to bring facts as well as circumſtances directly in contradiction to his aſſertions, were ſure to be repreſented as Tories, unfriendly, or as enemies to America, though

By Mr. Searle, and ſome others, it has been deemed criminal next to high treaſon, not to go thoſe lengths; indeed one would imagine that he carried

The generous and noble enthuſiaſm, which firſt inſpired them, to oppoſe acts and claims, injurious to our rights and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges has been kept up after the claims and acts have ceaſed to exiſt, and its force turned to the ſupport of independent ſovereignty, a claim never heard of on our part, until ſince the year 1775. Yet I cannot in juſtice to myſelf and friends conceal from them my ſentiments on the important ſubject, nor the dangers which to me appear at the door. It is the intereſt of each of the contending parties to make peace as ſoon as poſſible, and nothing at this time prevents, but our claim of independent Sovereignty, which France by treaty is bound to ſupport. If we conſent with an accommodation with England, the great obſtacle will be removed, if we do not, it is probable that the war will become more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and it is not difficult to foreſee where we ſhall land, and in what condition in the general ſtorm; have we not by ſending ambaſſadors to almoſt every Court in Europe, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The ſpirit and manlike boldneſs, with which we aſſerted our rights, and ventured ſingly to oppoſe Great-Britain in the defence of them, drew the attention of all Europe, and raiſed our character high, and the very name of an American became reſpectable, but the turn which our affairs have taken ſince the year 1778, owing to the management of them by men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texicated with the ideas of ſovereignty, and the flattering proſpect of becoming ambaſſadors, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys, &amp;c. thus reverſed the ſcene, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced the world at large, how unequal our gentlemen in Congreſs, are to the taſk of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns, and of great ſtateſmen.—Emoluments have had their weight with theſe men, the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taryſhip to an embaſſy, has not been thought below their acceptance, eſpecially as a ſalary of 1000<abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling, per annum, was attached to it.</p>

In the examination of the queſtion, ſome regard ought to be paid to what has paſſed in the world, and we ought to inquire if any country ever was, for any time, even for one century at

This is a ſerious enquiry, and France has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready put it in our power to anſwer the queſtion. When Spain offered to mediate between France and England, the latter accepted the mediation, on condition that France withdrew their reſcript of March 1778, which declared America inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent—to this France replied, that England could not with propriety demand of them a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion at the beginning of a war, the events of which were uncertain, which they could only be brought to grant at the cloſe of an unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate war. This reply of France ſays plainly, that if the war ſhould be unfortunate on their part, our independence may be given up, and ſhews in what point of light we are conſidered. —The events of the war have not hitherto been fortunate, on the part of France and Spain, nor have they been greatly unfortunate though the balance (were the accounts now to be ſettled)
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:017509_0080_0FA1261570EEE6B8"/>is againſt them.—Future events are uncertain, but ſhould France or Spain unfortunately looſe conſiderably, we and our independence remain as a pledge, by a reſtoration of which their loſſes will be made up; if on the other hand, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land proves unfortunate, the acknowledgement of our independence, may ſerve them in the ſame ſtead, if the latter proves the caſe, as it poſſibly may, after two or three years more of war; what by that time will be our ſituation? Our country ravaged, and exhauſted, our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce deſtroyed, an immenſe internal and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign debt contracted, the intereſt only of which will be a greater tax, than we ever had any idea of before this war, to which will be added, the ſupport of civil government, as expenſive, or more ſo than formerly, and the expences of new eſtabliſhments, internal and external, ſuch as Courts of Admiralty, &amp;c. Boards of Trade, of Marine, of Treaſury, &amp;c. &amp;c. of Ambaſſadors, Envoys, Conſuls, &amp;c. which alone will amount to more than all our former public expences, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides we muſt have a marine force at leaſt, or we cannot expect to have our flag reſpected—nor our commerce ſecure from impoſition—ſhall we find ourſelves equal to all this? Will the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of America, taught to believe, that they fought to exonerate themſelves from taxes, be contented under ten times the tax they ever paid, and to have the ſame entailed on their poſterity?—In this ſtate of weakneſs, debt,

<pb n="72" facs="unknown:017509_0083_0FA12617B2486408"/>contrary, I can neither think nor write without touching, and even dwelling on the ſubject, in fact, it is the only one, which lies down with me at night and riſes with me in the morning, it accompanies me in every circle whether gay or ſerious, and often makes me blind and deaf to every thing elſe. I am ſometimes attacked by prudence, which aſks me what I have to do, under my circumſtances with the politicks of any country, or particularly of one more than an other. She tells me if I have time to liſten, which I ſeldom have, that of all men, I ought not to meddle, that being fairly on ſhore, though after ſuffering a ſhipwreck, I have nothing left but to collect what I can of my fortune out of the wreck, and make the beſt of it.

I promiſed myſelf with being able to do ſomething in the commercial way. I have been diſappointed from various cauſes, I hoped to have finiſhed my accounts ſoon, and received the conſiderable balance due me from Congreſs; but though my accounts with vouchers to ſupport

Congreſs have been informed near a year ſince that their audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor could not ſerve, yet they have not appointed any other, tho' they knew I was waiting at my own expence to adjuſt my account. The cruelty and injuſtice of this proceeding is too viſible to require my enlarging on it, I am diſcouraged in writing to men, who conſider themſelves omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, and who have among their other attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, taken that of doing injuſtice when they pleaſe, and juſtify all by the tyrant's plea, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; out of a balance of more than 300,000 li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres, I have not been able to obtain one ſhilling, by a prevailing junto in Congreſs, I have been repreſented in America as a defaulter grown rich at the public expence, this was done to prejudice my countrymen againſt me, and to cover or juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify their horrid ingratitude, and at the ſame time to force me on a dangerous and expenſive voyage, to obtain juſtice here, where they had previouſly taken ſuch arrangements, as to counteract me in purſuit of my right; it is true they appointed an auditor, but laid him under ſuch reſtrictions, that they muſt have known at the time, that no man of ſpirit would accept the office, and on a refuſal, they have neglected the naming any other; does this ſhew them acting like my credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in earneſt for the ſettlement, or like ſhuffling evaſive debtors, who puſh it off, by every means in their power, to have ſome plauſible excuſe for

               <p>A Gentleman lately here from America, aſſured me, that it was conſidered by our country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as political hereſy or treaſon to entertain a doubt that France would under any circumſtances whatever, give up our independency by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from its alliance with us.—This way of thinking, reflects honour on m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What nation in Europe has not during that period broken their moſt ſolemn treaties, and deſerted their allies, as often as ſtate neceſſity or public intereſt and ſafety dictated the meaſure? I declare I know of none; England (and untill lately we joined them in it) has always been very free in cenſuring the cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="76" facs="unknown:017509_0087_0FA1261AAEF3BEB0"/>formerly. On an impartial review of the paſt, and examination of the preſent, I confeſs, I think we ſhall, and if we eventually become the dupes, and are ſacrificed by our unſuſpicious confidence, the political world will judge, at leaſt, that we were rather too young and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced for the great affairs we engaged in. The ſtyle of Congreſs appeared to me, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, a little too ſtrong and preſumptuous, when in September 1779, they declared that the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of America was as fixed as fate; this was in a religious view, bidding defiance to Omnipotence, and placing our independence on a baſis which no civil government or human ſyſtem ever yet could boaſt of. Since my return to Europe, I have had leiſure to take a calm and unprejudiced view of our ſituation, and however confident you may be in America, I can but have the moſt diſtreſſing apprehenſions for our future peace, liberty and ſafety; not that I have more reaſon to diſtruſt the good faith of France than that of any other nation, under ſimilar cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, but I have every reaſon to doubt of the favourable iſſue of the war, and if it ſhould be unſavourable, France has already declared to the world the part it will take with regard to our independence. I will explain myſelf—when Spain offered to mediate, England inſiſted on France's withdrawing the reſcript of the 13th March 1778, (which acknowledged our inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence as preliminary to any treaty) France
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:017509_0088_0FA1261B70C3E6E8"/>replied that it was unreaſonable in England to require that at the beginning of a war, (the events of which were unce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tain) which could only be complied with at the cloſe of an unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful war. This reply needs no comment. The war, though not greatly unſucceſsful hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, on the part of France, has been very far from being ſucceſsful; France is at this time a great loſer on the whole, but whilſt the high ſtyle of England embroils that nation with other Powers, and ſo long as we find employ for near one half its forces, France will continue the war, and encourage us by temporary and partial ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, and the moſt liberal promiſes—but a ſtorm is gathering on the continent of Europe, and how ſoon it will burſt, God, who views the hearts of all men (the Emperor's not execpted) only knows, but the moment it begins, we muſt bid adi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Will France in no caſe, do at this time, what they have repeatedly done heretofore? I mean not to caſt the leaſt reflection by referring to any particular inſtance, what I have already ſaid of nations in general, will clear me of having ſuch intention—But we ought to recall to our minds, how often the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Scotland, ſince the beginning of this cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, have been encouraged to riſe in claim of their ſuppoſed rights, and of thoſe of the Houſe of Stuart; ſtores, troops, ſhips and money have been ſent to their aid, the conſequences are two well known to need repeating—At the cloſe of a war, not very unſucceſsful on the part of rance, they were given up, and their Prince, Charles Edward, though he, as well as his anceſtors, had received as ſolemn promiſes from France, to be re-eſtabliſhed on the throne of England, as we can pretend to have for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency, was ordered to quit the kingdom, and on refuſal was publicly ſei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But there is a treaty, and our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic and national honor and character are pledged. But if France, to whom it is pledged, trifles with us, if unable or unwilling to aſſiſt us effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, or if to ſerve its own views, it leaves us to wear out the force of its hereditary enemy by our deſtruction, are we holden to ſupport our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour pledged in treaty, at ſuch an expence? The univerſal maxim of all nations, <hi>Salus Populi, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prema lex,</hi> will in ſuch caſe have no weight with us, by perſevering we may poſſibly, though not probably, effect with others, the ruin of Great-Britain; but if we and our country muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved and cruſhed by the fall of that paternal edifice, in which we once took ſhelter, and in the beauty and grandeur of which, we once placed our greateſt pride and ſecurity, ſhall we act the parts of patriots or madmen? I know not how you will reliſh theſe reflections, but I cannot forbear making them, ſo long as I can neither forget my country, or ceaſe to be anxious for its peace, liberty and happineſs. I wrote you a few days ſince on private affairs, by the way of L'Orient, I will therefore cloſe this by aſſuring you, that nothing perſonal, though I have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered more injuſtice, than almoſt any man of my time, has had the leaſt influence on my mind, as to our general intereſts. I have done much towards promoting a ſeparation from Great-Britain and for independency—I acted from a

When I query whether the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of America will prove of ſo great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to France, as was once imagined, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine myſelf to advantages merely of a commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial nature, to be derived from us in that ſtate. If France by our aſſiſtance ſucceed ſo far, as to ruin the commerce and marine of Great Britain, and if we in the courſe of effecting this, become reduced to be in effect dependant on France, there can be no queſtion but that we ſhall be of advantage to France, but ſuch a ſuppoſition de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys every idea of real independency.</p>

               <p>PRESUMING that you ſtill continue in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and that the friendſhip which has ſo long ſubſiſted between us, remains unimpaired, I have determined to write you a long and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidential letter, on ſubjects intimately connected to the well being of our country. Some of the ſentiments I am about to communicate, may perhaps appear inconſiſtent with my former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and profeſſions, and therefore it is incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on me to explain the cauſes which have in any degree changed my political opinions. I need not particularly recur to the origin of the
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:017509_0093_0FA1261F2FB2F7D0"/>preſent controverſy with Great Britain; what I profeſſed and did at that period, was profeſſed with ſincerity, and done with the beſt intentions, but had I then foreſeen one half of the calamities that have followed the meaſures of that time, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of approving, I ſhould have moſt ſtrenuouſly oppoſed them; for it muſt be confeſſed, that we were actuated rather by the apprehenſion of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture grievances, than by the actual preſſure of any which we really felt; and moſt certainly I ſhould not have thought it either wiſe or juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable to run into the horrors of civil war, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more urgent neceſſity, and a much greater load of oppreſſion. But unfortunately, we in America were deceived by thoſe flattering ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts tranſmitted to us from England, as much as the Britiſh government was deceived by oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite accounts ſent from America. We were fully perſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aded that a majority of the people of Great Britain, approved our claims, and that a ſhort ſuſpenſion of commerce with that kingdom would obtain us all we deſired; under this deluſion we went forward until hoſtilities ſuddenly began: Thoſe who have moſt ſtudied human nature, and the hiſtory of mankind, will beſt conceive the effects and changes which followed: Inflamed and afterwards exaſperated by the provocations and ravages of war, our minds became gradually alienated from that people whoſe anceſtors were ours, and to whom we had always been connected by the ſtrongeſt ties, that can bind or unite ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:017509_0094_0FA1261FED929870"/>of men. We indignantly ſlighted that union which had been eſteemed our greateſt glory and happineſs, and under whoſe benign influence we had increaſed and proſpered beyond example. With this change in our ſentiments, we heard of the Britiſh government having engaged foreign troops to be employed againſt us, and we na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally determined to follow the example and ſeek foreign aid from thoſe moſt likely to afford it; for this purpoſe, and with this commiſſion I came to Europe, and the Declaration of Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency ſoon followed; a declaration which though abſent I approved of, becauſe I thought Independency attainable with but little more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty or bloodſhed, and that our countrymen were wiſe and virtuous enough to uſe it rightly and make it a bleſſing.—I had beſides other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons—I thought an independent government was allotted to us by nature, and that the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of it could not be long prevented, after the change which had taken place in our ſentiments reſpecting it: That, to depart from the claim we had made to it, would at that time and in that ſtate of things, be like haſtily <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="84" facs="unknown:017509_0095_0FA12620AE378EE8"/>renewal of ſuch calamities, I heartily concurred in negociating and ſigning the treaties with France, and afterwards returned to America, in the hopes of ſeeing our country ſoon reſtored to the bleſſings of peace, commerce, and good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: I need not tell you that the hope proved abortive, nor need I explain to you how much I was diſappointed and diſſatisfied by the changes which had taken place in America, and which were every day increaſing. You will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect the converſations that paſſed between us on this ſubject; I found indeed the hills, the mountains, and rivers of America, ſituated as formerly, but almoſt every thing which had d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But what appeared a more alarming evil, was the depravity of morals which had taken place among our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, and been encouraged if not produced by the revolution; and particularly by the laws
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:017509_0096_0FA126216D295B08"/>for making the depreciated and depreciating pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per currency a legal tender, inſtead of its no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal amount in gold and ſilver; laws which not only afforded temptations, but in effect offered rewards to diſhoneſty, by enabling thoſe already in debt to liberate themſelves for a twentieth or thirtieth part in value of the real debt, and encouraging all who could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain credit, or property from others, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold payment in the certain expectation of being able at a future period legally to exonerate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeves almoſt for nothing; laws by which more injuſtice ſeems to have been occaſioned, than what was ever committed under any other go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and among the ſame number of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in ſo ſhort a ſpace of time.

I could not avoid however, regretting, that a ſimilar change had taken place, and lamenting the miſerable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects which were preſent on every ſide.—Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture declining; the progreſs of arts and ſciences ſuſpended; the education of the riſing generation (the hopes of our country) neglected; thouſands of induſtrious youth forced from the plough, and other uſeful homely occupations,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:017509_0097_0FA126223353E868"/>and prematurely deſtroyed by the diſeaſes, wants and ſufferings of a military life, whilſt the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivors by exchanging their plain morals and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt induſtry, for the habits of idleneſs and vice, appeared more likely to burthen than to bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit their country hereafter, and above all the numerous cauſes and ſources of future diſſentions between the diſterent States, left very little room for agreeable expectations or ideas. Diſtreſſed at the proſpect of theſe, and a thouſand other evils, of which there appeared neither a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, nor an end, you will not wonder that I quitted a ſcene ſo unpleaſant, and came again to this country, where I have had time and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to reflect diſpaſſiona<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ely, on the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtate of things, and the probable conſequences ſo far at leaſt as the intereſts of our country are concerned; and from theſe reflections, combined with all the facts and informations, that I have been able to obtain, I have deduced two propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, of the truth of which I am fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, however extraordinary they may appear in America:—The firſt of theſe is, that there is no probability of our being able finally to eſtabliſh our independency; and the ſecond, that if it were eſtabliſhed, it would prove rather a curſe than a bleſſing to us.—As I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that you will at leaſt read with attention and candour, what I write on ſubjects ſo inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting; I will enter into a particular conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of each of theſe propoſitions, and begin with
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:017509_0098_0FA12622F3AB43B0"/>the firſt which concerns the probability of our being able finally to eſtabliſh the independency which we have aſſumed and declared.—Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience has I preſume by this time, ſo far cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected the vain opinions we formerly entertained of our ſtrength and reſources, than ever the moſt inſane of all our mad politicians will hardly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that we can alone reſiſt the force of Great-Britain. —The final eſtabliſhment of our inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency muſt therefore greatly depend on the aſſiſtance, which other nations may be able and willing to afford us, and I think it very evident, that we have moſt egregiouſly flattered and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ourſelves on this ſubject. There is indeed a generous propenſity in human nature which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines mankind to favour thoſe who ſtruggle againſt ſuperior force, in defence of their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and juſt rights, and this propenſity led many ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>viduals in different parts of Europe, (who conſidered us engaged in ſuch a ſtruggle,) to beſtow on us their unavailing good wiſhes and applauſes.—But it is impoſſible that the motives of our revolt ſhould have been really approved by the government of any kingdom or ſtate of Europe, becauſe there is not one among them, whoſe ſubjects and colonies were ſo free as thoſe of Great Britain; and it would have been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly abſurd, in any government, to vindicate our claim to privileges, which at the ſame time it denied to its own ſubjects; and beſides inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections are naturally viewed with jealouſy, and
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:017509_0099_0FA125C16EB68EA0"/>diſlike, by all regular long eſtabliſhed govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as of dangerous example to their own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.—It happened indeed that Great-Britain, by her vaſt acquiſitions of wealth and power, had become the object of envy and dread to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain European nations, who without expecting or intending, that we ſhould ever become inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, were pleaſed at our revolt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced to ſee that kingdom weakening itſelf by a deſtructive civil war, and leaſt we ſhould be too ſoon ſubdued, and the miſchiefs of our revolt too ſoon terminated, a little ſcanty aſſiſtance was from time to time ſecretly given to us, until this alliance was publicly announced, and France engaged in the war againſt Great-Britain, it might have been naturally expected that every other Power in Europe inclined to favour our independency would have openly acknowledged it, after the example of France. Great-Britain was then univerſally believed to be ſo weakened and diſcouraged, that no nation could have been reſtrained through the fear of incurring her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment; and therefore it is difficult to conceive why any one really withing for our indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, ſhould have witheld from it the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an open avowal or acknowledgement, which would neceſſarily have tended to finiſh the work and ſecure our future gratitude and friendſhip—But though more than three years have paſſed ſince the French alliance was announced, no other nation has manifeſted
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:017509_0100_0FA125B4B4094DE8"/>the leaſt intention to follow the example, or the leaſt favourable inclination towards us, but ſeveral have, on the contrary, moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equivocally diſcovered, that their wiſhes and views are repugnant to our pretenſions. The government of Portugal very early proſcribed all intercourſe with us, in terms of extreme vigor, if not hoſtility; and this very proſcription re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains unrepealed—That of Denmark has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied our independency, and even forced out of our hands (as out of the hands of pirates) ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral prizes which our ſhips of war had taken from Great-Britain, and ſent into the ports of Norway—The Emperor is notoriouſly an enemy to our independency—he retains an hereditary attachment to Great-Britain, as well as jealouſy to the Houſe of Bourbon; and views with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, on every ſide, the territories of his anceſtors poſſeſſed by his neighbours—he is in the full vigor of his life, maſter of the beſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplined, moſt numerous and formidable army in Europe, and certainly is not without ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, enterprizing views; ſo that ſhould the war continue, we have every thing to fear from his influence and interference, which certainly will be againſt thoſe nations who poſſeſs the countries he wiſhes to regain, and not againſt Great-Britain who witholds nothing from him, and from whom he has nothing to claim—He has indeed already prepared the way to interfere by offering to mediate between the belligerent
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:017509_0101_0FA125B56D7C0B00"/>powers, and you need not be told that an unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful mediator almoſt always takes part in the quarrel—The Dutch, though at war with Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, publicly diſavow our independency, and ſo far from connecting their cauſe with ours, that they notoriouſly would have made a ſeparate peace with Great-Britain, had not the Britiſh Government refuſed to treat ſeparately with the States-General; a refuſal that manifeſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> how little the Britiſh Miniſtry feels itſelf embarraſſed by theſe new enemies. Whatever you in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica may imagine, the true intereſts of the Dutch are by no means favorable to our independency; they have no manufactures of any conſequence for our uſe, and as merchants, fiſhermen and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers, we ſhould certainly become their moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous rivals and competitors: Reſpecting Ruſſia and Sweden, they certainly cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to gain by our independency, excepting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digo and rice we have nothing for their uſe:— Ruſſia exports tobacco, and their other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions are all ſimilar to ours, and we ſhould naturally interfere with them in every market. The governments of theſe countries have never manifeſted the leaſt diſpoſition to favour our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency; I think, at moſt we can only flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ourſelves that they will remain idle ſpectators.

The little pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſums that have been obtained (leſs than a mercantile houſe in moderate credit might have ſupplied) have been dealt out with ſuch niggardly reluctance, that it manifeſts the moſt beggarly meanneſs and inſenſibility to accept, and much more to ſollicit them ſo long and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunately. Nothing is more evident to me than that Spain looks on our independency with jealouſy and averſion, as being a moſt danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous example to her vaſt American e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Indeed ſhe cannot deſire that ſo remarkable a revolt from the greateſt power of Europe, ſhould by <hi>its ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful iſſue</hi> afford encouragement to her diſtant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces to make ſimilar attempts, nor can ſhe wiſh that a new maritime empire ſhould riſe up ſo contiguouſly to her treaſures and American poſſeſſions, which at all times have been the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of her peculiar care and jealouſy. An em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire too far removed from Europe to be reſtrained
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:017509_0106_0FA125B9F0D8EDB8"/>by the power of Spain, and too near the ſources of that power not to excite the utmoſt fear and apprehenſion. So long as the Spaniſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment continues at war with England, ſo long it will naturally wiſh us to be the inſtruments of injuring and diſtreſſing that nation. But when the war ends, that government will undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly wiſh to ſee us, not only reduced again to the dominion of Great-Britain, but at the ſame time weakened and chaſtiſed, ſo that inſtead of affording encouragement to its colonies by a ſucceſsful revolt, we may ſerve as an example to deter them from attempting to become inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent. I think it therefore evident, that France, the only nation that has acknowledged our independency, is alſo the only one inclined to ſupport it. How long that nation, contrary, to the views of Spain, and the reſt of Europe will think it wiſe or neceſſary to continue the war for our ſupport, are queſtions that merit our moſt ſerious conſideration.</p>
               <p>The only advantages which France can have expected from our independency, are a diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the trade and power of England, and an increaſe of her own commerce by a participation in ours, there advantages doubtleſs were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the treaties with America, a few meaſures of government ever gave more univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal ſatisfaction, that was manifeſted by the French nation when thoſe treaties were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, but ſince my return here I have ſeen
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:017509_0107_0FA125BAB0877640"/>that ſatisfaction generally abated and ſucceeded by diſappointment, ſo that in truth but little benefit is now expected from our independency, at leaſt by the moſt diſcerning part of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The merchants complain of loſſes on al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every adventure to our country, through the depreciation of the paper currency, the breach of public faith, and other cauſes unfavourable to us. They complain of a general predilection towards Engliſh manufactures, which in ſpite of the war, and the laws of the ſeveral ſtates, are imported through Holland, St. Euſtatius, &amp;c. and every where purchaſed by our countrymen in preſerence to thoſe of France, or any other nation. Moſt of the French gentlemen that have ſerved in our army or travelled in our country, complain of a ſimilar predelection in favour of Engliſhmen, and manners, and a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ave, ſion from thoſe of France. They per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a general diſlike of them among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and alledge, that French Officers who ſight and bleed, in our cauſe, receive fewer at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and civilities from our countrymen, than are beſtowed on Britiſh officers of inferior rank when taken priſoners. In ſhort, that our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, habits, propenſities and prejudices, are all Engliſh, as well as our language, and that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther regard for our allies, the authority of our laws, nor yet the animoſities which the war ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily produces, can engage us, even during its continuance, to ſuſpend the uſe of Britiſh
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:017509_0108_0FA125BB6F562618"/>manufactures, or lay aſide our former regard for individuals of that nation; and it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore naturally concluded that when peace ſhall be reſtored, whether we remain independant or not, the greateſt part, if not the whole of our commerce will certainly return again to its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Britiſh channels, and that our former at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to that nation, will again revive, ſo as to leave little or no benefit to this country from our independence. Thoſe of our countrymen who viſit France, afford cauſe for ſimilar conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, retaining the ſame appearances, manners, language, prejudices, affections and averſions, they are confounded with, and miſtaken for En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhmen by all but thoſe to whom they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally known, and as their peculiarities but ill accord or aſſimilate with thoſe of our new al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, they feel like ſtrangers or exiles from their country, and generally haſten through this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to Oſtend, Amſterdam, &amp;c. from whence, in ſpite of Dr. Franklin's earneſt diſſuaſions, and even the menaces of Meſſ. Adams, Dana, Searle, &amp;c. the greateſt part of them ſecretly venture over to England, and when arrived there (tho' in conſtant danger of being impriſoned) they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt believe themſelves at home; ſuch is the power of old habits, and early prejudices. You will not therefore wonder that a diſcerning, jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous nation, like this, begins to think with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race, <hi>Naturam expellas, &amp;c.</hi> and to perceive that nothing will finally detach us and our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:017509_0109_0FA125BC2EF8B050"/>from Great Britain, and that ever if our independency was eſtabliſhed, we ſhould ſoon be again united to that country by confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the cloſeſt alliance, and to contribute as much if not more, than ever to it's trade and power. This, the moſt ſenſible part of the French nation believe, and with this belief it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A man muſt be little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with hiſtory, who can imagine, that becauſe the French government has acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged our independency, and entered into trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with us, that it will therefore never deſert us: The ſame government had much oftner ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and aſſerted the right of the Stuart family to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="99" facs="unknown:017509_0110_0FA125BCEE8E3A68"/>oftner promiſed to maintain that right, yet thoſe promiſes were never fulfilled; multitudes who truſted to them were deceived and ſacrificed; even the Pretender himſelf, notwithſtanding the moſt formal acknowledgements and frequent promiſes was not only abandoned, but to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the Britiſh government, was exiled, ſeized, and ignominiouſly tranſported out of France. I have many reaſons individually to be ſatisfied with the French Miniſtry, and therefore I would not mention tranſactions of this nature, even to you, were they not ſo generally notorious. It may however appear invidious, and it certainly is unneceſſary to recollect ſuch facts, or apply them to the preſent queſtion, becauſe the French government has itſelf with unuſual candor, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly explained its opinion of the extent and force of its engagements to us, when they ſay in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the demand of England, that France would withdraw its reſcript of the 13th March, 1778, as a preliminary to the mediation of Spain: That it was not reaſonable to expect of them, to do that at the beginning of a war, (the events of which were uncertain) which could only be done at the cloſe of an unſucceſsful war.</p>
               <p>France, therefore, holds herſelf at liberty to deſert our alliance and independency at the end of an unſucceſsful war, and as the preſent is not pretended to be a ſucceſsful war, the inference is plain, and the time to apply it may be near; ſo long indeed as we are able to ſupport a great
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:017509_0111_0FA125BDB0071EC8"/>part of the war, and France eſcapes any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſaſter, this government may not be in haſte to abandon us, becauſe we may be thought the cheapeſt and fitteſt inſtrument for weakening our parent country: But our reſources, credit, and ability to bear any conſiderable ſhare in the war, will be ſoon totally annihilated, and when this happers, I am fully convinced, that France will no longer ſuffer her treaties to deprive her of peace: let us however ſuppoſe that France ſhould obſtinately perſiſt in the war, and even that Spain, contrary to her ſyſtem and views, ſhould do the ſame in order to eſtabliſh our indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, ſtill it does not appear probable, that this object would be finally obtained. The navy of France has for ſome time been in the moſt formidable ſtate to which it can be carried.

This might be demonſtrated by many facts, but I think it will not appear doubtful, when you recollect the immenſe ſum that was ſubſcribed in England for the ſervice of the preſent year, and that the Britiſh Court, far from fearing new enemies, not only attacked the Dutch, but has ſince refuſed the mediation of Ruſſia, in making a ſeparate peace with that republic. It has long been faſhionable in America to rail at the Britiſh go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as being not only wicked but weak and incapable. Theſe imputations are however certainly repugnant to facts, for it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that none of the belligerent powers has diſplayed ſo much vigor and ability as Great-Britain, in proſecuting the war; and though we may incline to ſhut our eyes againſt the truth, a great part even of the French nation is juſt and generous enough to acknowledge, and admire the ſuperior fortitude and intelligence with which
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:017509_0114_0FA125BFEF789E50"/>the Britiſh government has hitherto repelled and fruſtrated the efforts of enemies ſo much more numercus.

But a few years have elapſed ſince you, and I believe every other American, were firmly convinced that the peace, freedom, and happineſs of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, could in no way be promoted ſo well and ſecured, as by a dependence on the Britiſh

Recollect the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous opinion of that time, and compare it with what has ſince been taught and believed on this ſubject in America, and then let me aſk you, whether this change of opinion be the work of reaſon and experience, or of exaſperation and madneſs?

Should I aſk the advocates of independency what benefits they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, which we did not, and might not again enjoy without it; I ſhould probably be told, freedom of legiſlation and of commerce; it ſeems
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:017509_0117_0FA125C2ED64BA40"/>however to me, that on both theſe ſubjects we are deceiving ourſelves. There are few, if any benefits, which we have not their attendant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages. There may be too little as well as too much reſtraint in the making of laws, and the former exceſs is full as miſchievous and liable to abuſe as the latter: In thoſe which were called Royal governments, the exerciſe of the King's prerogative may have ſometimes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented wholeſome laws, but on the other hand, it has alſo prevented the people from injurious ones, and if we were to review the legiſlative acts of the ſeveral ſtates ſince the revolution, we ſhould find that the facility in making laws, has produced a multitude of baſtly and injudicious, not to ſay pernicious ones; and that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of theſe has been greateſt in the States, where the feweſt reſtrain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Among all the nations in Europe, there is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly none, where commerce is ſo reputable, or where it is carried on by men of ſo much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, probity, and honour as in Great Britain, and conſequently there is no where an American

You, my friend, know ſo much of hiſtory, and of mankind in general, as well as of our countrymen in particular, that a little reflection muſt convince you, that the Democratic Governments lately formed in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica are far from being ſuited to the people there. I need not remind you of the tumultuous diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ingratitude, violence, and injuſtice, which
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:017509_0120_0FA125C52F9390C0"/>in all ages and parts of the world have attended this ſpecies of government, I can only ſay, that if it can be advantageous to any ſocieties of men, it is only to thoſe which are ſmall and uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by luxury or vice.—Our own colony of Connecticut has I believe experienced the beſt effects which a Democratical government is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of producing, but theſe effects have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted wholly from the rigid morals, frugality, and induſtry of the people: And we muſt not forget that in the adjoining colony of Rhode-Iſland, the very ſame Government was attended with much anarchy, faction, licentious diſorder, and injuſtice. And if we conſider the late pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of luxury, immorality and vice, and the decline of public virtue among our countrymen, there will appear but ſoo much reaſon to fear that the Democratical Governments eſtabliſhed in the united ſtates will produce the ſame dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful effects, which the hiſtory of the world, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us they have invariably produced in every large ſociety or government where they have been eſtabliſhed. But the inteſtine diſorders, that may ariſe within each particular ſtate among its own inhabitants, are not the only miſchiefs to be expected, greater evils, if poſſible, are to be apprehended from the contentions of different ſtates with each other, conſidering the various manners, prejudices, and prepoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="110" facs="unknown:017509_0121_0FA125C5EDB9EAD8"/>impoſſible that our confederation can long ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, or that we can long remain at peace with each other, when relieved from the preſent war with Great-Britain—Hitherto the different ſtates have voted ſupplies according to the allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and requiſitions of Congreſs, but there is not a ſingle ſtate, which has not proteſted againſt theſe allotments as being unequal, and claimed future retribution. To allot the portions of public expence to each of the ſeveral ſtates with exact juſtice, will always be a difficult taſk, on account of their continually varying circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, but when theſe allotments are made as juſtly as poſſible, it is not probable they will ever be ſatisfactory to all, ſo that from hence a fruitful ſource of future diſcord will ariſe.— Virginia claims to itſelf almoſt all the valuable uncultivated lands, adjoining to the united ſtates, and is rapidly ſelling them; other ſtates proteſt againſt the injuſtice of this claim; Virginia and Pennſylvania have already been nearly engaged in hoſtilities on account of their boundaries; and hoſtilities were ſometime ago actually begun between Pennſylvania and Connecticut on the ſame account, and are now only ſuſpended by the more urgent neceſſity of reſiſting the arms of Great-Britain.—There are ſimilar diſputes between New-York, Maſſachuſetts-Bay, and New-Hampſhire, which though now dormant, would immediately revive, ſhould peace and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency be eſtabliſhed in America. I had
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:017509_0122_0FA125C6ADAEF628"/>almoſt forgot the inhabitants of ſeveral inferior diſtricts, who aſſume a right of ſeparating from the colonies or ſtates, to which they have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to belonged, in the ſame manner as thoſe colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies have ſeparated from Great-Britain, and of being admitted into the confederation as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct independent ſtates.—One of theſe ſtates in particular (that of Vermont) is ſecretly abetted, by ſome of the New-England ſtates againſt New-York, and though Congreſs has undertaken the deciſion, it dares not decide againſt the claim and pretentions of the people. In ſhort, the ſources of internal commotion and civil war between the ſeveral ſtates are ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and plentiful that it does not ſeem poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for peace and union long to ſubſiſt among them, or that evils even greater than thoſe we have ſuffered, ſince the declaration of Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency ſhould be avoided after the eſtabliſhment of it: The protecting, mediating and reſtraining influence or power of ſome other nation is indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſably neceſſary to our well being, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there is no other nation on earth ſo well ſuited to this purpoſe by religion, manners, language, government, &amp;c. or on which we can ſo honourably and advantageouſly depend as Great-Britain.</p>
               <p>If then there be no probability of finally eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhing the Independency we have declared, and of the eſtabliſhment of it be more likely to prove pernicious than beneficial to us, what ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:017509_0123_0FA125C76FAAE950"/>or objection is there to prevent our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the beneficial claim and reconciling ourſelves again to the parent country? Of all the various objections that have been made on this ſubject at different times and by different people, there are but two which deſerve the ſmalleſt notice. The firſt of theſe is, that the ſolemn acts and declarations of the King and Parliament of Great Britain, are not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied upon; That when we ſhall have laid down our arms, former pretentions may be revived and new acts of Parliament made to ſubject our rights, &amp;c. If there be any force in this objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it will operate even more ſtrongly againſt negociating for peace than for reconciliation; a treaty of peace would be an act of the crown only, and might be more eaſily evaded than a ſolemn compact, in which the Parliament as well as the King would be a party. Thoſe therefore who from apprehenſions of this nature, refuſe treating for reconciliation, ſhould not think of treating for peace, they ſhould reſolve to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the war with unrelenting fury; to reprobate the folly of Congreſs in ſending Mr. Adams to negociate with Great-Britain, they ſhould forget how often that nation has interpoſed to ſave the civil and religious liberties of other countries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ambitious views of France and Spain, and regardleſs of the danger of f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="113" facs="unknown:017509_0124_0FA125C82F27C700"/>nation is exterminated; in this and only in this way they will act conſiſtently and reconcile their actions to that diſtruſt which they profeſs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain of the national faith of Great-Britain— Wiſe, impartial men, will however think, that objections of this nature come with very little propriety from the people of America, who, as an independent people, are too young, and even already have ſhewn too little regard for their own national faith, to have a right to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt that of others; and eſpecially of a nation ſo long diſtinguiſhed by a faithful adherence to its engagements, and which, even at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, enjoys the confidence of Europe more than any other, as is manifeſted by the readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with which the people of all countries, even of France itſelf, ſtill lend and confide their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to the Britiſh government, notwithſtanding its embar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But what renders this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection more contemptible is, that it proceeds from thoſe very men who were moſt active in evading and violating the moſt ſolemn engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the moſt ſacred obligations of juſtice reſpecting the redemption and value of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs bills of credit.

<pb n="114" facs="unknown:017509_0125_0FA125C8ED56A8B0"/>of it promoted our public meaſures; but my jealouſy and zeal were naturally extinguiſhed when Congreſs on the 18th of March, 1780, committed that very act, which, but ſix months before, they had unanimouſly and publicly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated as <hi>"excerable deed,"</hi> an <q>

I do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that any deviation from our engagements with France, can add to our national diſhonor, nor can I indeed diſcover any way to eſcape this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor and infamy, but by deſerting that indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency which we have ſo diſgracefully perverted, and blending ourſelves again with the Britiſh nation, but I would not even for ſo deſirable a purpoſe commend an unjuſtifiable departure from our treaties with France. It has already been demonſtrated, that the French government conſiders itſelf, as at liberty, to deſert us at the end of an un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Politicians do not generally feel or expect much from ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of national gratitude, yet I am far from wiſhing that my countrymen ſhould become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful.

I was willing even to err by an exceſs of grateful ſentiments towards our new ally, ſo long as that exceſs appeared harmleſs, but when a claim on our gratitude is ſet up, and oppoſed to the peace and happineſs of millions, it becomes proper at leaſt to enquire if it is well ſounded? In what, let me aſk are we obliged to France? She ſcarcely knew a ſingle individual of our country, and therefore could not have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated by any motive of regard for us, at the time when ſhe began to afford us ſecret aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.

In ſimilar circumſtances as much aſſiſtance would have been given to any other people under heaven, and there can be no cauſe for gratitude for any aid given in ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and with ſuch views. The firſt an of the French government evidently was to aſſiſt us juſt ſo far as might be abſolutely neceſſary to prevent an accommodation, and to give this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance with ſo much ſecrecy as to avoid any rupture with Great Britain. On this plan ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours were firſt permitted to be dealt out to us, by private individuals, and only on condition of future payment, but afterwards we were thought to be ſuch cheap and effectual inſtruments of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to the Britiſh nation, that more direct and gratuitous aids were afforded us; theſe were however ſoon diſcovered, and frequently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of by the Britiſh government, and as often denied by that of France.

No written proof of the leaſt importance was ever left in our hands, even Mr. Gerard's letters appointing occaſional interviews with us, were always without any ſignature, and though five hundred thouſand livres were quarterly paid to our Banker, from the Royal Treaſury, not the ſmalleſt evidence of the ſource from whence that ſubſidy came, was permitted to remain in our power. So much precaution did nor paſs unnoticed by us at that period. I ſaw clearly, and with concern, that it was dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:017509_0129_0FA125CCB0ACB180"/>by a perſuaſion that we ſhould be finally ſubdued by the arms of Great-Britain, and an intention finally to deſert and diſown having ever had any connection with us: Towards the end of the ſummer 1777, this court ſeems to have thought the time near for ſo abandoning and diſavowing us. The capture of Ticonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roga, and the progreſs of General Burgovne's army on one ſide, with the victory at the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dywine, and the taking of Philadelphia on the other, convinced the French Miniſters, that the period of our reſiſtance would ſoon come, and made them ſolicitous to remove every impreſſion which the aſſiſtance previouſly given to us might have been made on the Britiſh Government. Amicable proteſtations and aſſurances were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore renewed, with unuſual ſervour, and leaſt words alone ſhould be inſufficient, they proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to important and effectual acts of complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance American armed veſſels were every where arreſted and detained in the French ports, and afterwards only permitted to ſail, under en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements to return home without committing any act of hoſtilit in the Puropean Seas.

                  </gap>uncea in Parliament, of ſoon offering the moſt liberal terms to America, produced a ſudden change in the conduct and policy of this Court reſpecting us. It was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, or at leaſt believed, that nothing ſhort of an open declaration in our favour, would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the quarrel, or prevent our reconciliation with Great Britain; and it was apprehended, that when reconciled, both countries might turn their force againſt France,—England from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment for what had been done, and America for what had been refuſed for our ſupport. The French Miniſtry then appeared, for the firſt time, to think ſeriouſly of promoting a final ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration between us and our parent country, being convinced, from the ſtrength which we had manifeſted, in ſingly reſiſting the power of Great Britain, and the general diſcouragement which notoriouſly prevailed in that nation, that
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:017509_0131_0FA125CE2E6211B8"/>ſuch a ſeparation might be effected with but little difficulty, and no danger to France.</p>
               <p>The propoſals of Congreſs, therefore, which had been leſt twelve months unnoticed, were ſuddenly accepted, and the treaties ſpeedily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and afterwards haſtily announced to the world, in order to fruſtrate the pacific endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the Britiſh Government, and engage us to reject it's liberal offers, for promoting a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation. Having been perſonally engaged in concluding and ſigning the treaties with France and perſonally favoured and obliged to it's Government, and being alſo perſuaded as I then was, that thoſe treaties would prove infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely beneficial to our country, I very naturally approved of their ratification, and of the rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all terms offered by the Britiſh Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners. Situated as I then was, and thinking as I then did, it was impoſſible for me to act other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; but yet I ſhall for ever regret, that a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of our countrymen were not wiſe enough to know, and purſue their own intereſts, and to accept of offers, which contained every thing conducive to their future peace and proſperity, and which, had the, been accepted, would have ſaved us and our parent country innumerable calamities, and have preſerved thouſands of uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful rives, with oceans of kindred blood, which have been ſince offered up as a ſacrifice to our idol, Independency.—Unhappily that time and opportunity were irrecoverably loſt, and all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grets
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:017509_0132_0FA125CEEEC7C8C8"/>muſt neceſſarily prove unavailing. It now only remains with us to employ all our thoughts and faculties in repairing the miſchiefs that are paſt, and ſtopping their future progreſs.</p>
               <p>In examining the motives and views of the French miniſtry there appears no reaſon to believe that the change in its ſyſtem and policy towards us, and the treaties thereby produced, were the effect of a regard for our country, any more than the preceding reſolution to diſown and abandon us, had been—In every variation of conduct, this Miniſtry, like true politicians, purſued what they conſidered as the intereſts of their country, regardleſs of ours; and though I have no deſire to cenſure them for acting from ſuch motives I cannot admit that any juſt title to our gratitude can be from thence derived.—If we proceed to review what has paſſed ſince the treaties were announced, we ſhall doubtleſs find abundant reaſon to form the ſame concluſion.—By your ſtation in Congreſs you muſt have neceſſarily known the extent and nature of the ſuccours afforded to us by this government ſince the war, and I cannot believe, after mature conſideration, that they have been ſuch as to lay our country under any great load of obligation.—I do not mean, like Mr. J. Adams, to aſſert, that <q>France has broken, or at leaſt not fulfilled the terms of her alliance with us,</q> though, between ourſelves, I cannot but think there is ſome foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for ſuch an aſſertion, by the letter as well
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:017509_0133_0FA125CFADDA01B0"/>as the ſpirit of the treaty; the firſt article of which ſays, <q>If war ſhould break out between France and Great-Britain during the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the preſent war between the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States and England, his Majeſty and the United States ſhall make it a <hi>common cauſe, and aid each other mutually with their good of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, their councils and their forces, according to the exigence of conjunctures, as becomes good and faithful allies.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It is to be remembered, that before France en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the war, we had alone ſupported a very unequal conteſt with Great-Britain for near three years, and had thereby incurred an enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous debt, and nearly exhauſted all our credit and reſources; it might therefore have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the terms of our engagement, that inſtead of continuing to bear an unequal ſhare of the burthen, our own proportion would have been lightened by our Ally, in conſideration of what we had previouſly done and ſuffered alone; but has this been in any degree the caſe? Is it even true that France has ſince, in proportion to her ſuperior wealth and numbers, borne a juſt ſhare of the war? No enemy has ravaged or even landed within this kingdom; no new tax has been levied to ſupport the war; almoſt every thing expended is the fruit of oeconomy, and has been employed in building and ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a formidable navy, and particular care has been uſed to expoſe it as little as poſſible, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:017509_0134_0FA125D06CE174C8"/>that it may remain entire at the end of the war. The ſame principle which has furniſhed the means, appears likewiſe to direct the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the war on this ſide, whilſt England and America have been waſting their ſtrength and reſources againſt each other; very ſtrong and early repreſentations were as you know made, and from time to time repeated, to this govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, reſpecting the diſorder of our finances, and the abſolute impoſſibility of ſupporting the war, unleſs our ally would either lend, or aſſiſt us in borrowing conſiderable ſums of money; but theſe repreſentations produced no effect, altho' France has from the beginning always been able to borrow with ſo much facility, that there could have been no difficulty in affording us ſufficient pecuniary aid, if the inclination to do it had not been wanting. It is not until ſince the alarming revolt of the Pennſylvania and Jerſey troops, that this government could ever be brought to promiſe a ſingle ſhilling towards paying the army in America, and the ſum now granted is placed under the direction of General Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, in a way that manifeſts a total want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in Congreſs, and renders the General in effect independent of the body by whom he is commiſſioned, and who will not dare either to diſmiſs, or even to diſoblige him; becauſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his concurrence, the army cannot obtain a ſingle ſhilling. You can beſt decide whether Congreſs has deſerved this diſtruſt, not to ſay
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:017509_0135_0FA125D12DFE0088"/>inſult; but if that body has deſerved this, it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly does not merit the confidence of America; and in either caſe, the preference ſhewn to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Waſhington ſeems likely to produce dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous jealouſies to ſay no more; the eſteem which I have long entertained for him precludes every ſuſpicion that he will adopt, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the inſtrument of any improper deſign. But this reference will doubtleſs be conſidered and repreſented in America, as indicating an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in this government to attach General Waſhington, to the intereſts of France, and to ſupport him againſt all oppoſition, and it is eaſy to conceive the animofities likely to reſult from ſuch apprehenſions.</p>
               <p>Reſpecting the ſea and land forces ſent at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent times to America, they doubtleſs were never ſuited nor intended to drive the Britiſh forces out of the United States, probably this government thinks that ſo great a part of the Britiſh forces can no where be employed and waſted ſo advantageouſly for France, as in fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the people of America, where they can do no harm to the French nation, and where we are under the neceſſity of oppoſing them, but were the Britiſh fleets and armies transferred from the continent to the Weſt-India iſlands, it would depend on our inclination, whether we followed them or not, and in either caſe but eſpecially in the latter, the French and Spaniſh poſſeſſions would be in imminent danger. Theſe
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:017509_0136_0FA125D1EEE16760"/>reaſons ſufficiently explain, why in truth, the French Government never did nor will make any effectual efforts to drive the Engliſh from New-York, &amp;c. Reſpecting the fleet and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſent laſt year to Rhode-Iſland, under the command of Monſ. de Ternay, and Monſ. de Rochambeau, you who were in Congreſs, need not be told the purpoſe for which they were profeſſed to be ſent, and probably by this time, you will be convinced that the great additional force which was promiſed, and of which the firſt ſent was repreſented only as the van guard, was really never intended to follow, and that the true, though ſecret object in view, was not ſo much to act offenſively againſt the Britiſh forces, as to ſecure and hold Rhode-Iſland, in the ſame manner as Queen Elizabeth held cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary towns belonging to the Dutch. This Government has for a confiderable time been apprehenſive that Great-Britain might ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the ſouthern States by conqueſt, or their own defection, but it was alſo expected that the people of New-England, by more vigorous and perſevering efforts would ſtill maintain the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, even if all the other States ſhould be again reduced to their former dependence, on the Crown of Great-Britain. The herbour of Rhode Iſland is commodiouſly ſituated in the center of New England, and was therefore thought a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireable poſſeſſion by the French Miniſtry, and a fleet and army were accordingly ſent to fortify
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:017509_0137_0FA125D2AEF5C638"/>themſelves, and remain there, ready to favour and encourage thoſe among us, who ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more attached to the French intereſt, and diſpoſed to go the moſt deſperate lengths againſt reconciliation with Great-Britain, and at the ſame time ready to overawe and reſtrain thoſe of a contrary diſpoſition. Indeed any one who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders how long the French fleet and army have remained in their ſtation at Rhode-Iſland, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having ever received any order to engage in the ſmalleſt offenſive enterprize, and that no attempt has been made to ſend even the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the reinforcements promiſed, muſt conclude that this fleet and army were not ſent to America for our ſakes, ſo much as to gain an advantageous ſtrong hold in our country, and a controling influence over the people there, in order to prevent our reconciliation with Great-Britain, until we ſhall both have ſo far weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ruined each other, that France with a formidable navy <hi>carefully preſerved,</hi> will at the cloſe of the war have nothing to fear, whatever becomes of us, or of our independency. Many other facts might be adduced, but they cannot be neceſſary to ſupport this general repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the policy and views of France to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, and to invalidate every cliam which may be made from thence, on our gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>itude, if it be then true that there is no validity, in either of theſe objections, nor any probability of finally eſtabliſhing our independency, and if the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:017509_0138_0FA125D36D5C6570"/>of it would more likely prove preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial than beneficial to us, it is high time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on our ſituation, and inſtantly terminate the deſtructive conteſt in which we are engaged. Dr. Franklin's ſentiments on the ſeparation of America from Great-Britain, even after the declaration of independency, are very plainly, as well as forcibly expreſſed, in his letter to Lord Howe, <q>Long (ſays this venerable patriot) did I endeavour with unfeigned and unwearied zeal, to preſerve from breaking that fine and noble China Caſe—the Britiſh Empire, for I knew, that being once broken, <hi>the ſeparate parts could not retain their ſhare of the ſtrength and value that exiſted in the whole;</hi> and that a perfect re-union of thoſe parts could ſcarce ever be hoped for.</q> I know of nothing that has occurred ſince the date of that letter, to induce Doctor Franklin to change his private ſentiments on this ſubject, it is true that at that time, a re-union, though devoutly to have been wiſhed for, could ſcarce be hoped or expected, ſo long as every original cauſe of the ſeparation ſtill exiſted, and were ſo many obſtacles in the way of the wiſhed for re-union; but thoſe hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been ſince removed, and America having fatarly experienced, <q>
                     <hi>that ſeparate, it does not retain even it's ſhare of that ſtrength and value which exiſted in the whole.</hi>
                  </q> On the Doctor's own principles, a re-union ought to be hoped for, and endeavoured after with <hi>unfeigned and

If our own future proſperity requires that we be again united to Great-Britain, and if through inability to reſiſt, we muſt eventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally return to that nation, it is both parricide and ſuicide to employ and waſte our ſtrength and blood for the deſtruction of a country, which is ſhortly to become our's, and to which we muſt hereafter reſort for protection and ſupport, againſt thoſe to whom we are now attached, and whoſe ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

You may be aſſured that England is determined, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> no conſideration, nor in any circumſtances what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to admit of our independency; that nation is neither exhauſted nor diſpirited, its energy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources, and national character never appeared in a greater and more ſtriking point of view than at this time; you are not to ſuppoſe that all the powers of Europe have deſerted Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and become indifferent to the fate of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which at different periods have relieved and defended moſt of them, when in the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger themſelves; nor have you any ground to conclude, as too many raſhly do, that becauſe no power in Europe has as yet declared for England, that therefore they all (at leaſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly) wiſh us ſucceſs. There is no nation at this day in Europe, except England, in which the ſubjects are in reality anything more than the properts of government, for except that <hi>arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and tyrannical nation</hi> of Great-Britain, they are no where entitled to any ſhare in the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The government of Holland, about which you have heard ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> much and know ſo little, is included in the above deſcription, being an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute ariſtocracy, the members of which are not
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:017509_0146_0FA125D96F191930"/>choſen by the people, but by thoſe who compoſe the ariſtocracy; that government is in its nature as deſpotic as any in Europe, but fortunately for its ſubjects, the genius of commerce protects them from the baneful effects of deſpotiſm; they think they are free, they have not experienced the contrary, and until lately have been happy, but is it not ſurpriſing that we ſhould imagine, that monarchs who hold their own ſubjects in chains, ſhould, from motives of diſintereſted ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity and the love of liberty, aſſiſt a people in their revolt from a government infinitely milder than their own? A people whoſe firſt and favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite poſition is, that all men are by nature equal. Reflect cooly for a moment if the ſounding epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets of <hi>great, good, generous, diſintereſted ally,</hi> protector of the liberties of mankind, &amp;c. will protect you, and then anſwer me: Few nations ever engaged in war but from motives of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, intereſt or revenge; the latter is notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly the ſole motive in Spain for the preſent; her intereſt in incompatable with our indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, in every point in which it can be viewed. Spain is ſenſible of this, and therefore will not acknowledge us—Can it be believed that an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary, deſpotic and jealous monarchy can wiſh to ſee a mighty empire of confederated republics, whoſe religion, genius, and form of government are directly the reverſe to, and naturally at war with theirs, eſtabliſhed in the neighbourhood of all its treaſures? at the doors of its unarmed and
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:017509_0147_0FA125DA2CFEDC20"/>enervated colouies? But Holland is alſo at war with England! rather ſay that England is at war with Holland, for the latter has not, as yet, made a ſingle repriſal; but if the States of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land enter ſeriouſly into the war, they will not do it on our account, nor will they take any part in our affairs; they have told Mr. Adams ſo, in plain but modeſt terms, repeatedly—They are not ſo much intereſted againſt our independency as Spain; but they are far from being intereſted to have it eſtabliſhed, every other power to the North are intereſted in a greater or leſs degree againſt us, the natural produce of their country being the ſame as ours. As to thoſe to the South they muſt naturally be indifferent to our fate, except Portugal, which is eſſentially affected by what affects England, and is of courſe as great an enemy to our independency as England can be; but the Southern powers, Spain excepted, are of very little importance in the preſent ſubject. If I were to hazard a conjecture it would be, that the Emperor of Germany &amp; Empreſs of Ruſſia will ultimately take part with England, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the conteſt, and that the terms of peace will finally be dictated by them. If we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to reject all overtures, until ſuch an event arrives, unconditional ſubmiſſion will be our fate; but if thoſe and all the other Powers in Europe, remain peaceable ſpectators of the war, it does not follow that Great-Britain muſt fall, her naval power and reſources are equal to thoſe
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:017509_0148_0FA125DB0D1B87A0"/>of all her enemies, and the war being ſolely maritime, the event muſt be uncertain, Great-Britain is undoubtedly able to ſupport the war for ſeveral years to come, and ſhe is at all events reſolved to hazard every thing ſooner than yield to our independency; but ſuppoſe the war con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for two years longer, and ſuppoſe at that period, the reſources and maritime power of Great-Britain exhauſted and broken, her credit loſt, and general bankruptcy and deſpair through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her dominions, and finding no friend to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere, that ſhe is obliged to receive the law from her enemies.—This may afford a triumph for us for a moment, before our reſentments have time to cool, but when we have laid down our arms and become cool enough to look round, and examine our ſituation, we ſhall find that we have purchaſed this triumph at the price of the peace, ſafety and liberty of our country, we ſhall by that time find our country exhauſted and ravaged, an immenſe national debt on us, and the expences of our civil government, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic departments, ſo greatly increaſed, that the burthen of the whole will be unſupportable.— The war has already coſt us more than thirty millions ſterling, if juſtice were to be done to every one, and though by the breach of public faith, and the higheſt act of national injuſtice and deſpotiſm ever known, it is liquidated at much leſs, yet two years continuance of the war, will leave us near that ſum in debt, the new
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:017509_0149_0FA125DCF9BBC518"/>eſtabliſhed government will coſt us, ten times more than the old ever did; we now expend near 20,000<abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling annually, on foreign em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſies and agencies, at the peace theſe eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments muſt be enlarged, as well as the expence; Congreſs muſt be ſupported in a certain dignity, Boards of Treaſury, of Marine, of Commerce, &amp;c. muſt be eſtabliſhed with ſalaries, ſufficient to induce men of abilities to ſerve; Conſuls in the different foreign ports muſt be appointed, a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine force muſt be kept up to a certain degree, or our flag will not be reſpected, nor our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce protected in any part of the world.—In ſhort, from the beſt calculations I can make, the expences of our public government will greatly exteed 100,000<abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling annually, independent of the expences of the government of each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular State, which will neceſſarily be increated, and if j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If ever a ſtate was calculated for Democracy, it muſt have been Connecticut; an equality of fortune, the influence of religious ſentiments, ſober, virtuous and frugal manners, with the ſmall extent of territory, were all in our favour; and we and our anceſtors were happy under an apparent Democracy—I ſay apparent, for we always beheld and acknowledged a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power at a diſtance, and complied with its requiſitions, but the caſe will be materially different in future, if independency is eſtabliſhed at the peace, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In 1775, the number of inhabitants amounted to about three millions, ſettled on a ſea coaſt of near 1500 miles in extent, with an immenſe continent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them, fettile and uninhabited, except by a few wandering ſavages; and being all employed (a very few <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

            <p>The demand for this produce, encouraged and paid for the clearing up, and improving the lands, and gave ſuch a ſpring of agriculture and navigation, that thoſe moſt uſeful arts were carried to great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection, and were rapidly improving.</p>
            <p>This annual exportation, of three millions and an half, was not a clear profit in favour of America, for the greateſt part of it, and at times the whole, was returned in foreign commodities, part of which might have been diſpenſed with, but at the ſame time it muſt be acknowledged, that if<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> clear that America, tho' it had not the practed, had the moſt it creaſing capital of any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in the world—It has already been obſerved that the increaſe of population in America, was at the rate of cent per cent every twenty years; and if their exports are examined, they will be found to have increaſed in ſtill greater proportion from 1675 to 1775. This obſervation be carried further, and it would be eaſy to ſhew, that every uſeful art and ſcience had, during the ſame period, kept pace with the popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and cultivation of the country in America— But it is ſufficient for the preſent adjuſtment of our general account, to ſhew that the capital, or ſtock of America, in 1775, without mentioning leſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But it may be ſaid with juſtice, that neither the number of inhabitants, extent and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of the terr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But the claims of the Britiſh Parliament to the right of making laws binding on America in all caſes whatever, and to tax its inhabitants at pleaſure, with other acts, of theirs ſince 1763, ſubjected both the liberties and property of America to the will of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament—America was alarmed at ſuch dangerous claims, and apprehenſive of the conſequences, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated and proteſted againſt thoſe acts and claims, and reſolved to oppoſe them to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt. It was, as Congreſs in the moſt expreſs and ſolemn manner declared, not for the "gaining any new rights," but to ſecure thoſe which by charters, compacts and the Britiſh conſtitution, they, as Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh ſubjects, were intitled to; that America conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded—In the courſe of the two firſt years of the war, matters were carried ſo far, that Congreſs judging that the Parliament was determined in no caſe to recede, but to purſue and enforce thoſe claims
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:017509_0158_0FA125E32EEFF208"/>and acts to the utmoſt, reſolved to ſeparate America from the Britiſh Empire, and declared it independent and ſovereign—The people of America confirmed this reſolution of Congreſs, to maintain their rights and priviledges, not as being part of the Britiſh Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire but ſeparate and independent—It is near five years ſince this reſolution was taken.</p>
            <p>I have briefly ſhewn what the ſtock or capital of America, was previous, and by what means it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came in danger, In the next place I will endeavour to ſtate with impartiality, what our loſſes and gains have hitherto been; but it muſt previouſly be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that thoſe claims and acts of Parliament, which brought both our liberty and property into danger, and which gave the only original cauſe for the diſpute, having ſince been given up and repealed, independent ſovereignty remains the only object for which Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica is now adventuring, for ſince every perſonal right and priviledge may be ſecured and enjoyed, though America continues part of the Britiſh empire, there can be no other, America then, has credit for ſtock in hand in 1775.

            <p>For three millions of inhabitants, the annual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of which ſtock was 150,000 people.</p>
            <p>For three millions and an half of annual produce, over what was conſumed by the inhabitants, which encreaſing annually in the ſame ratio, with the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of population added to the capital 175,000<abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling yearly.</p>
            <p>For the navigation, fiſheries and commerce, which America then had on hand, amounting to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe value, and increaſing at the above rate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vii" facs="unknown:017509_0159_0FA125E3EE9E20B8"/>
For the peace, good order and moral principles of its inhabitants as ineſtimable, as they were unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd in almoſt any other country.</p>
            <p>Theſe articles put to the credit of the account, let us examine the debit, or what deduction is to be made on the ſcore of expences, and diſburſements, at and before that period. The ſupport of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſuppoſing it to have coſt each province 8000<abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling annually (which is eſtimating it high) amounted to 104,000<abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling,</p>
            <p>The duties paid by the commerce, taken at its higheſt groſs produce, to be between 30 and 40,000<abbr>l.</abbr> annually.</p>
            <p>In this account the balance appears at once to be immenſely in favour of America, and juſtiries the Americans in oppoſing with the utmoſt firmneſs and perſeverance, every claim or act of parliament, which tended to diminiſh, or deprive them of it. But thoſe claims being now out of the queſtion, and America offered the peaceable enjoyment of this capital with all its encreaſing advantages, ſecured and guaranteed under the Britiſh empire, it is evident that in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to ſtate the account of our expences and loſſes, previous to this, ſtand as ſo many charges, incurred in defending and ſecuring our original ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital ſtock, that effected, every thing further muſt be charged againſt independent ſovereignty.</p>
            <p>This account is moſt unqueſtionably the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant that America, or perhaps any other country, ever had to conſider and to ſtate fairly, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice or partiality, and I truſt my honeſt and brave countrymen, will view it in this right, that they will eſtimate without exaggerating, or diminiſhing, what their loſſes and expences have actually been, ſince the preſent object of independent ſovereignty, has been
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:017509_0160_0FA125E4ADBD9458"/>the only one in queſtion, what the ſituation of our country has been ever ſince it has been claimed and exerciſed, what our circumſtances now are, what they were previous to this conteſt or to 1763, and from comparing the preſent, with the paſt, form a true judgment on the whole to direct their future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. In the beginning of 1778 an offer was made to America to be placed in the ſituation it was in, at, and previous to the year 1763, to have all the griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances complained of by Congreſs in 1774 and 1775 redreſſed, to have the acts which they remonſtrated againſt, and which were then declared to be the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ole cauſe of the war, revealed, and ſeveral advantages granted to America, which the inhabitants had n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, previous to 1763, either claimed or enjoyed, had theſe offers been accepted of, the account would then have been cloſed (as I have already ſhewn) in our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. But independent ſovereignty was by Congreſs made an eſſential prelimenary, <hi>a ſine qua non,</hi> of any negociation at all. In July 1776, the above terms had not been offered to us, and a perſuaſion that England would not recede ſo far, as to offer them was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ground on which that reſolution was taken. All the declarations of Congreſs and of the different American aſſemblies prove the truth of this fact; the declaration of independence itſelf acknowledges it, and the arguments made uſe of in ſupport of the meaſure were all drawn from that preſumption only, Foreign aid was ſollicited, this could neither he aſked or granted conſiſtently with the laws of nations, and the ſaith of treaties, whilſt we a knowledged our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be the ſubjects of Great-Britain, therefore being reſolved to deſerd our rights, the foreign aid ſollicited, became indiſpenſably neceſſary, and the eſtabliſhment of civil government in the ſeveral pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:017509_0161_0FA125E5703BDAC8"/>equally ſo, to prevent general anarchy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. On this ground, and on this only, Congreſs were forced into a meaſure, which they had before reprobated in all their public declarations.— In their petition and addreſs to the King, and people of England, in 1774, and 1775, they ſolemnly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led God to witneſs, that they had no view of a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and that they regarded ſuch an event as the greateſt of evils, which could befall both countries. I dare appeal to the warmeſt ſupporter of the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of July, 1776, to ſay, if the ſame offers had been made on the part of England, as were made in 1778, any ſuch reſolution would have paſſed in C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, or in any one of the American aſſemblies. Our Declaration of Independence could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>t give a new cauſe of complaint, or our part, againſt Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, though by our challenging a new right unheard of by our anceſtors, and expreſsly diſclaimed by all the pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>dence being conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, as the only ground on which our rights and liberties could be eſtabliſhed and ſecured, under the circumſtances America then was, the meaſure on this principle was conſiſtent and right but otherways wrong, and contradictory to our repeated and moſt ſolemn declarations.—From the moment, therefore, in which we were offered a redreſs of the grievances we had complained of, and to have the rights re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, to be confirmed, and that in the very way in which our petitions to the Crown of England had pointed out, no other ſubject of diſpute could remain, but the new claim of independent ſovereignty, and to this only all our ſubſequent loſſes and expences are to be charged.—And as we were in 1778 of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered aſſiſtance, to reimburſe the expences of the
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:017509_0162_0FA125E62FD11E90"/>war, our pervious expences, by the refuſal of that offer, may with juſtice be charged to the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p>I have ſtile the claim of Independence a new and unheard of claim; the following expreſſions of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs will juſtify me;—In the unanimous petition of that body to the King, in 1774, they ſay, <q>

            <p>The number of houſes, in a country where the materials for building are found in plenty, and coſt little more than the charge of collecting them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, will ever be in proportion to the number of inhabitants; but there are not at this time more houſes in America, than there were in 1775, whereas by the above calculation, they would, had we been at peace, have increaſed near one third. In the Autumn 1774, upwards of five hundred houſes were contracted for to be built in Philadelphia the next year. Other Towns were in proportion to that City. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of houſes in country Towns and Villages was ſuch, that the articles of nails, window glaſs, and other neceſſary materials for building, formed a very capital part of our imports; I will not purſue the ſubject, theſe obſervations being ſufficient to juſtify the preſumption, that the number of inhabitants has not increaſed to any conſiderable amount ſince the war. It is indeed impoſſible to aſcertain this with certainty, as no exact numbering was ever made; the aggregate of three millions was a preſumed one, from the general eſtimate made by the Delegates from
<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:017509_0165_0FA125E870802728"/>different parts of the continent. But the number of houſes not having increaſed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>or houſe rent advanced, convinces me that there has been but little, or no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe ſince the war. The annual importation of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, amounted to near 20,000 one year with another; the ſtopping of this ſource of population, our loſs of men by the war, the continual emigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from us to Europe and the Weſt-Indies, and the before unexperienced obſtacles and difficulties, in the way of eſtabliſhing and ſupporting families, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to me ſufficient to have prevented any increaſe of our numbers. To this immenſe loſs of inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, we may juſtly add thoſe, who by a military life, or otherwiſe, in conſequence of the war have acquired ſuch diſſipated habits, that they cannot be expected to return to their old induſtrious and lab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This great and capital loſs, has been attended with another naturally and neceſſarily connected with it, and with the loſs of commerce, viz. the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline of agriculture, and reduction of our exports.

I will not preſume to ſay, that all our importations were wiſely made, or that many of the articles were ſuch as we had better have been without, for admitting of this,
