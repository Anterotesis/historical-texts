            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>PROVIDENCE ſeems to render the preſent publication neceſſary. The intereſt of CHRIST'S kingdom, my own reputation, and the importunity of friends concurring, I could not withſtand the motion, although I am exceeding loth to engage in a religious controverſy in my advanced ſtate of life. The firſt of theſe Eſſays was thrown together in haſte with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtrict order or method, being partly collected, and partly what occurred to my mind in reading the ſcriptures; and in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn reflection. The other Eſſays (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the ſecond and the laſt) were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with more deliberation, and are in the ſame method, and are nearly in the ſame words as they were delivered. The laſt piece which ſhould have been more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the firſt, in order to exact ſtating of the controverſy, lays the foundation upon which the whole is built. But the reaſon of this was, that children's memberſhip was acknowledged in the firſt church-meetings, and accordingly my arguments were found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on this conceſſion. But in the church-meetings laſt <hi>March,</hi> their memberſhip, or at leaſt the continuance of it at adult age was openly denied; and all the relat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <pb facs="unknown:012367_0004_0F89253531FD64D0"/>they had to the church was ſaid to be this, that they were <hi>laid under bonds</hi> to enter into covenant perſonally at adult age and to come to full communion; which if they failed to do, their relation to the church wholly ceaſed. This occaſioned my laſt Eſſay. I have had thoughts of reducing the whole that I have ſaid in the controverſy into one piece, which would have conſiderably ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened the work: But this would have taken up as much time as the firſt compoſure, which I had not leiſure for; and therefore the whole comes forth in the preſent form. Some of the ſame arguments recur in the following that were brought in the firſt piece, but they are ſet forth in a manner ſo differing as ſerves to throw light on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. I ſhall conclude this Preface with one caution. That whereas ſome expreſſions taken ſingly may ſeem to carry the matter too far in favour of <hi>unregenerates (openly ſuch)</hi> I deſire the reader always to take ſuch paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in connection with what is ſaid elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and then the ſeeming repugnancy will wholly vaniſh. I leave the whole to the Reader's candor; and hope the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine bleſſing will attend it, as it was really meant to ſerve the cauſe of CHRIST in a point which I apprehend of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</p>

            <head>THE FIRST ESSAY.</head>
            <p>QUEST. WHETHER the practice of perſons own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or renewing the covenant, and having baptiſm for their children, without coming immediately to full communion, be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable?</p>
            <p>Arguments for the affirmative.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I THINK the famous Mr. <hi>Mitch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll</hi>'s argument unanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werable. <q>1ſt. The whole viſible church under the new teſtament is to be baptized. 2d. If a man be once in the church (whether admitted at age or in infancy) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than cenſurable evil can put him out. 3d. If the parent be in the viſible church, his infant child is alſo.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This was the chief argument that convinced Dr. <hi>Increaſe Mather.</hi> It is impoſſible to get over this argument, but by ſaying, that not coming immediately to the LORD'S table is a <hi>cenſurable</hi> evil, a ſin that deſerves excommunication. But did any church ever hold this? Who has heard or read of any perſon's being laid under the church-cenſure meerly on this account? I grant, that the <hi>contempt</hi> of this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance deſerves excommunication, but not the meer abſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from it for a while. That may proceed from too high thoughts of the ordinance, and low thoughts of themſelves. To cut off ſuch would be <hi>a breaking the bruiſed reed</hi> with a witneſs, as Mr. <hi>Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nard</hi> juſtly obſerves in the church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords. We would bear with a communicant for not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the LORD'S table if he declares it is from ſcruples of conſcience reſpecting his ſtate, and not from contempt of the ordinance: Much more ſhould we bear with a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:012367_0006_0F892536DFADF088"/>that never communicated. Such ſhould be dealt with in <hi>the miniſtry of the word and from the pulpit,</hi> and not by church conſure. They ſhould not be treated as <hi>delinquent members</hi> (as in the caſe of <hi>hereſy</hi> or <hi>ſcandal</hi>) but be uſed with all tenderneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">II. All the arguments brought for infant baptiſm in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral do prove that baptiſm ought to be admin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſtred in the latitude pleaded for. Theſe arguments all center in this, <hi>that if the parents be in the covenant, the children are ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and ſo ought to have the ſeal of the covenant.</hi> Now it is granted on all hands, that the parents in queſtion are in the covenant, conſequently then children are ſo too; why then ſhould they not be baptized? To deny the validity of this way of arguing is to give up the cauſe entirely to the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts;</hi> and there is no way left to confute them, and their demand is juſt when they call for a direct ſcripture for infant baptiſm; as ſome demand a direct ſcripture in this caſe, which is exactly to tread in their ſteps. In ſhort, there is as much proof for this point, as for infant baptiſm; we argue by <hi>ſcripture-conſequence</hi> both in the one caſe and the ſame conſequences prove both points.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t, therefore members. And here we may obſerve, That CHRIST was never ſo angry with his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>d diſciples upon any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, as for this deba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ring of the ſubjects of his Kingdom being brought to him. Let us fear leſt he be as angry with us, if we do the ſame. The diſciples thought that they were not good men that brought theſe children; they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited no poſitive evidence of grace to their view; neither does CHRIST ſo much as intimate that they were gracious. But the ground he ſeems to go upon was, that as they were members of the church, they had a right to bring their children; thereby letting us know, that it is <hi>viſible <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip</hi> gives the right. If you ſay, their bringing their children was evidence enough of their faith in CHRIST, the ſame I ſay of the perſons in queſtion. If you ſay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This makes way for the conſidering ſome other objections.</p>
            <p n="1">I. It is objected, but theſe perſons do not come imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to the LORD'S ſupper; and therefore they ought to be ſhut out from other privileges until they will partake of the whole. I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. The church in all ages has been larger in admitting to baptiſm, than the LORD'S ſupper. In the primitive church there were three ſorts.

               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:012367_0009_0F89253910584BB0"/>And I might prove the point from the practice of all chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſince; but it would take up too long a time.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. I would mention ſome maxims or principles of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous divines, which carry their own weight with them. As
<list>
                  <item>1ſt. Baptiſm belongs to the diſciples as ſuch; the LORD'S ſupper to <hi>ſelf-examining</hi> diſciples.</item>
                  <item>2d. Baptiſm is a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of initiation or entrance into the church; the other of confirmation or growth in grace.</item>
                  <item>3d. Memberſhip in the univerſal church gives a right to baptiſm; but member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in a particular church to the LORD'S ſupper. Thoſe that the Apoſtles baptized as it were at large, muſt be join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a particular church before they could receive the LORD'S ſupper.</item>
                  <item>4th. Covenant intereſt alone giveth right to baptiſm, but not to the LORD'S ſupper. It is a great miſtake to think, that the parents <hi>immediate fitneſs</hi> for the LORD'S ſupper is the ground of baptizing their children; but it is the parents and ſo the childrens being in the covenant. We often have reaſon to think that ſome communicante are <hi>unfit</hi> for the LORD'S ſupper; but we cannot exclude them from that ordinance or from baptiſm for their children, being neither heretical or ſcandalous. The reaſon is, becauſe they are under the covenant. The ſame may be ſaid in the other caſe.</item>
                  <item>5th. <hi>That uncleanneſs</hi> would debar from coming to the paſſover, which did not unfit for the other ordinance of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012367_0010_0F892539D1D4DD78"/>Theſe ſeveral particulars import, that we ſhould not be altogether ſo <hi>ſtrict</hi> in admiſſion to baptiſm, as to the LORD'S ſupper.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3d. I anſwer, "A mans not joining to a particular church may be owing to the <hi>weakneſs of his tender conſcience,</hi> which ſcrupleth his fitneſs for the LORD'S ſupper; and yet would gladly have himſelf and his conſecrated to the LORD, yea and rejoice to be under the government and laws of CHRIST in particular churches."</p>
            <p n="4">4th. If the knowledge of a man's good eſtate (as they hold) is a neceſſary qualification for the LORD'S ſupper, it is his duty to ſtay away until he has this knowledge; and yet not neglect other duties in the mean time.</p>
            <p n="5">5th. If ſuch perſons are real and hearty in renewing co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant they will ſoon come further; if they are not, they had better remain where they are. It will be more for the honour of the church; for how often do thoſe who are only under a common work of the ſpirit, loſe their convictions, and (by their apoſtacy) become a ſcandal to religion and to the church that admits them? And hence we may ſee the impropriety of vehemently urging perſons to come imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately into full communion, when they do not find a <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> in themſelves to do it.</p>
            <p n="6">6th. We ought rather to encourage perſons to come as far as they ſee light in the path of duty, than to lay diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements and ſtumbling-blocks in their way. This is truly to <hi>carry the lambs in our arms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. It is objected, But if all baptized perſons are members already, why do they own the covenant? Is it not that, that makes them members? I anſwer, no: A perſon doth not become any more a member than he was before by renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the covenant. It is only a recognition or taking poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of his right in the manner the church thinks proper. It is like an officer's taking an oath for the faithful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of his office: It is not the <hi>oath</hi> that conſtitutes the office, but the <hi>commiſſion</hi> which he had before. There is no impropriety in calling all baptized perſons <hi>compleat mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> as our ancient Divines and the Synod expreſſly do. Memberſhip is a thing that cannot be increaſed or diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; there is no <hi>magis</hi> or <hi>minus</hi> (more or leſs) here: A man is a member or no member; there is no medium: But their CAPACITIES of ACTING are not the ſame; they may be
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012367_0011_0F89253A93E834E8"/>widely different. An infant or a communicant (become <hi>non-compos</hi>) cannot receive the LORD'S ſupper; yet they are compleat members. And there is no ſuch a thing as <hi>halfmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip</hi> or <hi>half-covenanting,</hi> and it is injurious to uſe ſuch an expreſſion. But what advantage is it to renew covenant then? I anſwer, This is a <hi>meer prudential</hi> of the church, to make the more <hi>deep</hi> and more <hi>durable</hi> impreſſions on the perſons concerned; to give them proper ideas of the ſolemnity of the affair; and alſo to impreſs on others a ſolemn ſenſe of their covenant-engagements, by a repetition of the covenant in their hearing. They have the ſame end in it that whole churches have, when they renew covenant <hi>openly</hi> and <hi>expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly,</hi> as the churches were wont to do formerly, and this church more than once in my Grandfather's days. But it never entered into their hearts, that they made any <hi>additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to their memberſhip by it. So it is in the preſent caſe. I am ſorry to ſee that this cuſtom of renewing covenant is ſo miſunderſtood by many; they ſeem to have got a notion, that by renewing covenant they are made members. But this is a miſtake; they are no more members than they were before: And the practice had better be laid aſide, than to be thus abuſed by ſuch groſs apprehenſions.</p>
            <p n="3">III. But it is further objected, it is only <hi>grace</hi> that gives a right to either ſeal; and therefore a perſon ought not to come until he knows his grace. I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. This objection doth not reach the caſe of thoſe that were baptized in infancy; but thoſe only that come for baptiſm at adult age. The former are members already, and therefore if we go to <hi>purge</hi> the church of them, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to let them renew covenant, (which is the ſame thing) let them be ever ſo blameleſs in their walk, we muſt go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtill, and purge the communicants likewiſe (who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new covenant every time they come to the ſacrament) and turn out all that we think have not grace, or that dare not ſay they are converted. And where we muſt ſlop no man can ſay. In ſhort, this is running directly into the moſt rigid principles of the <hi>Separates,</hi> who are for purging the church. We have no more warrant to caſt baptized perſons out of the church than communicants: And if we do the one we muſt do the other alſo, when there is the ſame ground for it, that is, reaſon to fear they are graceleſs. Indeed if <hi>hereſy</hi> or <hi>ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi> can be proved upon either ſort, let them be caſt out in GOD'S name; but not otherwiſe.</p>

2d. Theſe Perſons in queſtion exhibit thoſe <hi>ſigns of grace</hi> which our opponents ſet up as the <hi>only ſtandard</hi> for the church to judge by. They explode an account or <hi>relation</hi> of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences, at leaſt think them unneceſſary; and make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and practice the only criterion of judgment. Thus Mr. <hi>Green,</hi> one of the <hi>Connecti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t</hi> champions for the new ſcheme; he ſays in his late treatiſe, p. 57.8 <q>In the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of perſons, we are not to judge from the account of <hi>inward experiences:</hi> This is not laid down in ſcripture as the rule of publick judgment, but profeſſion and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</q> To this we entirely agree with reſpect to <hi>baptiſm.</hi> Why then will they not ſuffer perſons of <hi>regular practice</hi> to renew the covenant, when they deſire it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> or in other words, to add profeſſion to their practice, which (according to them, is all that is neceſſary; and ſo to have baptiſm for their children? this would put an end to the controverſy.</p>
            <p>Here, by the way, I cannot help obſerving, how ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous it is to inſiſt that none but <hi>gracious perſons</hi> ought to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the ſeals; and yet at the ſame time to ſay, that it is unneceſſary to give an account of the <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ings of grace in their ſouls,</hi> which is what we call experiences. This ſeems to me to be a direct contradiction. Such an account is really <hi>eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential</hi> to their ſcheme; and if ſeparated from it, it falls to the ground; and they really (after all their noiſe about grace) take up with leſſer evidences than we do in regard of the LORD'S ſupper.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. If this doctrine be true, then it will follow, that no believer while in the dark ought to come to either ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or even preſent his child to baptiſm; for then he implicitly renews covenant; which muſt not be done in a ſtate of darkneſs. And what confuſion would this bring into the church? We ſhould have but thin communions, it the members every time they come muſt know they have grace.</p>
            <p n="4">4th. According to this ſcheme, no perſon ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in any duty whatſoever, until he knows he has grace. For he is in danger of <hi>lying to</hi> GOD, or dealing <hi>falſely</hi> in the diſcharge of it; which is the grand objection in the preſent caſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5th. According to this ſcheme, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Joſiah</hi> were to blame for bringing their peop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e in general to renew co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, when they had reaſon to ſear that the greater part
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012367_0013_0F89253CD1624588"/>of them would come with <hi>a lye</hi> in their mouths, and they had better have let it alone.</p>
            <p n="6">6th. I have obſerved before; if perſons know not that they have grace, yet are conſcious of their ſincerity in what they do, they had better come than ſtay away. And if they ſhould be really deſtitute of grace, their coming will be leſs offenſive to GOD than the omiſſion would be. Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and renewings of covenant when only proceeding from a common work of GOD'S ſpirit, have been a means of removing or preventing judgments, as is evident from many places of ſcripture.</p>
            <p>And here I would mention one thing; I ſhould be glad to hear as much of the danger of the <hi>total omiſſion</hi> of theſe duties, as of the performing them in a <hi>wrong manner.</hi> The <hi>Jew</hi> that did not circumciſe his child was to be <hi>cut of from</hi> GOD's <hi>people, i. e.</hi> put to death: But no ſuch ſevere judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was threatned againſt the unregenerate perſon, that circumciſed his child. And <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf had like to have loſt his life, for the omiſſion of this duty.</p>
            <p n="7">7th. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt and CHRIST'S diſciples did not aſk thoſe they baptized, whether they knew they had grace. But upon <hi>their confeſſion of their ſins</hi> and promiſing reformation, they immediately baptized them, <hi>Matt.</hi> 3, 6.</p>
            <p n="8">8th. If this church ſhould agree to renew covenant at this day openly and explicitly as churches did formerly for the ſtrengthening their covenant engagements, it would be proper and neceſſary to call upon all the children of the church to join with us in it, as our Fathers did, as we may find on our church-records. And who in this caſe would dare to forbid or exclude them, though they did not come immediately to the LORD'S table? And if not why ſhould they be excluded when they come <hi>ous by one?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9th. If the knowledge of our good eſtate be neceſſary in order to partaking of the ſeals, it muſt amount to a <hi>certain</hi> knowledge. For how can a <hi>meer hope</hi> entitle us to it? How know we but it is the hope of the hypocrite? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a king ſhould give ſuch and ſuch privileges to perſons ſo and ſo qualified, it will not do for perſons to come and ſay they <hi>hope</hi> they have thoſe qualifications; they muſt <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly</hi> make out to their own and others ſatisfaction that they have them, or they have no buſineſs to put in their claim. So that this doctrine is come to this at laſt, that
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012367_0014_0F89253D8C14CDD0"/>nothing but <hi>full aſſurance</hi> will warrant our coming either to baptiſm or the LORD'S ſupper. And if we have this before we come, what need we come at all? At leaſt we need not come for this end, to get our evidences and comforts ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened; they being already come to their full ſtrength.</p>
            <p n="4">IVth objection. But why do you exclude any baptized perſon at all from bringing their children to baptiſm, if they are all members? I anſwer, the reaſon is, becauſe of their vicious lives. If a perſon be a lyar, ſwearer, ſabbath-breaker, whoremonger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he ought to be dealt with, and if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main impenitent to be cut off. In this caſe he forfeits his privilege. And this is the reaſon why perſons are propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that if any know they are guilty of ſuch things, they may object and get them excluded.</p>
            <p n="5">Vth and laſt objection. This will bring in impurity into the church. I anſwer, Diligent attendance to diſcipline, and not <hi>curtailing the covenant</hi> will keep the churches pure. The contrary doctrine rather tends to impurity: For per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, if debarred from renewing covenant and bringing their children, will be tempted from their great fondneſs for their offspring, to come too raſhly to the LORD'S table. And the church will likewiſe be tempted to be <hi>lax</hi> in their admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to prevent the complaints of ſuch perſons, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the reproach that ſuch ſwarms of children among them are in a ſtate of <hi>heatheniſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Several other weighty conſiderations might have been mentioned, but I forbear. I ſhall firiſh with obſerving, That this was the principle of almoſt all the firſt Fathers in the country; my Great-grandfather <hi>Cotten,</hi> Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> the famous Mr. <hi>Shepard,</hi> Meſſi'rs <hi>Wilſon, Mather, Allen, Rogers,</hi> and many others. And the practice was recommended by a <hi>Synod</hi> of all the churches of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> Colony in the year 1662. And it was agreeable to the ſentiments of my Grandfather <hi>Cotton</hi> the former Miniſter of this church, as I find by a manuſcript written by his own hand. And it has been practiſed by the generality of the churches for more than an hundred years paſt.</p>

            <p>Further CONSIDERATIONS illuſtrating the point.</p>
            <p n="1">I. IF the foundation be taken away, what will the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous do? What ſignifies it to keep contending who are the church, or who ſhall or ſhall not be received, when the very foundation of the church is ſtruck at, though not deſignedly? We are in reality no church, nor any of us members of a church, if this propoſition be not true, <hi>That theſe who are in the viſible covenant have a right to the ſeal of the covenant for themſelves and children.</hi> The very being of the church depends upon it; the whole controverſy turns here: If it be denied, our cauſe is betrayed to the <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> and we ceaſe to be a church: If it be granted, then our op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents give up their cauſe, and the children in queſtion are to be baptized. It is ſtrange therefore that this way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing is ſo little taken notice of, when every thing dear to us plainly depends upon it.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Upon the ſame foundation I argue, If the church ſhould vote to diſannul this practice, I ſhould think they wholly diſannulled <hi>infant baptiſm;</hi> for the ground of it would be wholly taken away: If this way of arguing be not conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, <hi>they that are in the covenant have a right to the ſeal of it for themſelves and children,</hi> there is no defence againſt them left, and we become downright <hi>Baptiſts</hi> without knowing it; at leaſt we hold <hi>infant baptiſm</hi> by meer tradition, without un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the grounds of it.</p>

I anſwer, The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this objection was taken away in my firſt Eſſay; in which I obſerved,
<list>
                  <item>1ſt. That this renewing covenant did not make them any more members than they were before: but was only a taking poſſeſſion of their right in the manner the church thought fir.</item>
                  <item>2d. That this taking poſſeſſion could not be denied them, unleſs <hi>hereſy</hi> or <hi>ſcandal</hi> could be

                  <item>3d. That no other evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of grace are neceſſary with reſpect to thoſe who are members already, than meer <hi>negative ones,</hi> unleſs the church aſſume an authority of purging the church upon the plan of the <hi>Separates.</hi> As negative evidences are ſufficient in regard of thoſe already in full communion, ſo alſo with reſpect to theſe in queſtion. I alſo add,</item>
                  <item>4th. There is no <hi>divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,</hi> that perſons ſhould renew covenant in this <hi>explicit manner,</hi> when they become adult; but it is a <hi>meer prudential</hi> of the church to make the more ſolemn impreſſions.</item>
               </list>
Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly I find, that the two famous Mr. <hi>Henrys</hi> (Father and Son) did not propoſe any <hi>explieit covenant</hi> to baptized perſons in publick at adult age: So far were they from thinking it <hi>eſſential</hi> to memberſhip. And we read nothing of circumciſed <hi>Iſraelites</hi> thus renewing covenant in order to partake of any of the privileges of that church. But yet there is great propriety in it for the end juſt mentioned. And if the church ſhould order a general explicit owning the covenant by us all every time we come to the ſacrament or once a year, there would be nothing amiſs in it, but it would tend to make the greater impreſſions, though not make us more members.</p>
            <p n="3">III. We find in ſcripture, that all the <hi>Iſraclitiſh</hi> nation, old and young, were <hi>baptized</hi> by GOD himſelf <hi>in the cloud and in the ſea,</hi> I <hi>Cor.</hi> x. 2. Here the <hi>children</hi> of unregenerate perſons had this rite adminiſtred to them by the higheſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and it was afterwards bleſt to them, though the parents were cut off. From this we may infer, that it is not contrary to the mind of GOD that children of perſons unregenerate ſhould have this ordinance adminiſted to them, if their parents be in covenant relation to him. This ſeams to be a <hi>type</hi> of what was to be done in goſpel times. The Apoſtle plainly ſpeaks of it in alluſion to the chriſtian baptiſm.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. I cannot be of the ſentiments of thoſe that are for altering the practice, unleſs I held that baptized infants are no members; or if they were, they loſe their member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip when they grow up, unleſs they come to the LORD'S table. They would be conſiſtent, though not true. But to grant that they were members then, and continue mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſtill, and as ſuch ought to be dealt with for miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors, and yet that their children are not members and have no right to the feal, is a ſtrange inconſiſtency, and what can never be it reconciled.</p>

               <q>As all children are part of their parents, and make but one perſon by the laws of GOD and men; ſo chriſtian infants are one perſon with their chriſtian parents, and make but one body with them, as the root and bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are but one tree; and this by divine ordination, and eſpecially in obligations to duties, and right unto fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and privileges ſpiritual, ſo far as they are capable. <note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p n="5">V. If the church ſhould alter this practice, what would become of thoſe who have already owned the covenant? part of their children baptized and part unbaptized, when they have the ſame right they had before: A motley mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture indeed, part of the church and part of the world. Here would be an excommunication with a witneſs.</p>
            <p>But they may be remedied by looking upon them as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in full communion, and allowing them without further ceremony to come to the LORD'S table: But this cannot be right. For, 1ſt. This would be to give them a privilege which they neither aſk for or deſire, and perhaps will not conſent to. Such may properly be called <hi>preſſed men,</hi> not <hi>voluntiers</hi> in GOD'S ſervice.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. To be members in full communion and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants is a contradiction in terms.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. Here will be ſome in full communion that never made any relation of their acquaintance with experimental religion, which will either make two ſorts of members in full communion, the one admitted without a relation and the other with; or it will cauſe the total laying aſide the relation of experiences. In the former caſe, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion will it make in the church, relations exacted from one ſort and not from the other? In the latter caſe, the total laying aſide of relations would deprive the church of one proper means of judging of their good eſtate. Without ſome account of their ſenſe of divice things we ſhall not know but all their religion is a piece of <hi>mechaniſm,</hi> meerly external: We ſhall have nothing left to judge by but <hi>blameleſneſs of life,</hi> which all acknowledge may be ſeparate from grace; and as to many we ſhould have no more than <hi>negative</hi> evidences of grace, that is, that we never heard any thing bad of them, their manner of life being little known to the greater part of the church, which muſt be frequently the caſe in great towns. This would do upon Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi>'s ſcheme, that the LORD'S ſupper was a <hi>converting ordinance,</hi> and to be uſed, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012367_0018_0F8925420B6F8938"/>livers, as the other means of grace: But for thoſe that hold that the church ſhould receive none but <hi>gracious perſons,</hi> for them to conſent to aboliſh relations, and to make ſuch negative and external evidences the only ſtandard of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appears to me a palpable contradiction. With regard to <hi>relations,</hi> I acknowledge that ſome of them are not very edifying, and others are too particular; we do not want <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p n="6">VI. The children of thoſe in the covenant are God's; <hi>they are born unto me,</hi> ſays God; <hi>they are my children. Ezek.</hi> xvi. 20, 21. That is, within my church and covenant: This is ſpoken of the children of unregerate <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> Certainly then we rob God of his portion, if we deny them the ſeal; and there will be no difference between the infants of ſuch as are in covenant, and the infants of <hi>Turks,</hi> which is not to be admitted: God himſelf claims a right to the one, but not to the other.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. It is the <hi>Baptiſt</hi>'s grand plea againſt baptizing infants, that they do not exhibit any poſitive evidences of grace.</p>
            <p>And how do theſe that are for the new ſcheme tally with them? Negative evidences are ſufficient in both caſes. As baptiſm is a ſacrament of <hi>entrance;</hi> ſo the loweſt degree of evidence is to be admitted in this caſe. Certainly fuller evidences are to be expected from thoſe that are admitted to the <hi>table,</hi> than from thoſe that only approach the <hi>threſhold;</hi> from <hi>proficients</hi> than <hi>incipients</hi> or firſt beginners at CHRIST'S ſchool.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> and others inform us, that the <hi>primitive church</hi> adminiſtred the holy communion to newly baptized infants, after the example of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> church, all their circumciſed children eating the paſſover with their parents. This practice was as early as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, who liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about 240 or 250 yeare after CHRIST, and for aught ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears much earlier; and it was continued univerſally in the church above 600 years, and in ſome of the <hi>caſtern</hi> chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches it continues to this day: St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> writes in defence of it. But although we judge them wrong in this, becauſe infants are uncapable of <hi>examining themſelves</hi> or of <hi>diſcerning
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012367_0019_0F892545A39F5E98"/>the</hi> LORD<hi>'S body:</hi> Yet from this practice we may infer that it was their general ſenſe that baptized perſons meerly by virtue of their baptiſm, were intitled to all church privileges, and that nothing but their open wickedneſs could juſtly debar them from it.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. Thoſe who oppoſe this practice, lay the whole ſtreſs of the controverſy upon this, that baptiſm is the ſeal of the covenant of grace; conſequently, ſay they, none but <hi>gracious perſons</hi> have a right to partake of it, and if they have grace, they ought alſo to come to the LORD'S ſupper, which is another ſeal of the covenant; and it is wrong to admit any adult perſon to the one, without they will immediately come to the other: The ſeals are not to be divided.</p>
            <p>It is granted on all hands that baptiſm is a ſeal of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace: The <hi>Synod</hi> that recommended the preſent practice univerſally held this; and ſo did the two Dr. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> Mr. <hi>Willard,</hi> and others, and ſo did Mr. <hi>Leonard;</hi> and yet they were all zealous for adminiſtring baptiſm in this latitude; they could ſee no inconſiſtency between theſe two principles. But how can they be reconciled? Anſ. 1ſt. They admitted the <hi>loweſt</hi> evidences of grace, even nagative ones, and ſuppoſed them ſufficient with reſpect to thoſe already in covenant. And to prevent <hi>ſcandalous</hi> perſons from bringing their children to baptiſm, they were always propounded before hand, that objections might in that caſe be made againſt their coming.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. With reſpect to thoſe <hi>without,</hi> that offered themſelves to baptiſm at adult age, they admitted the firſt dawnings and glimmerings of <hi>good</hi> as intitling them to that ordinance; as we find <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt did. <hi>Matt.</hi> iii.<note n="*" place="bottom">What multitudes did <hi>John</hi> Baptize? <hi>All Judea and Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, &amp;c. went out to him,</hi> except the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> ſays the text; and yet how few true converts among them! <hi>They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced in his light but for a ſeaſon. John</hi> v. 35; the generality ſoon fell off. This ſhows that <hi>John</hi> was not very ſtrict in his examination: As ſoon as any appeared to be affected with the ſenſe of ſin and were brought to <hi>confeſſion</hi> and promiſes of amendment, he adminiſtred the ordinance. And <hi>the diſciples</hi> who <hi>baptized more than</hi> John, (<hi>John</hi> iv. 1.) no doubt went upon the ſame plan. See this point further cleated by Dr. <hi>Inc. Mather</hi> in his treatiſe on <hi>the ſubjects of baptiſm.</hi> p. 37.</note> And the Apoſtle likewiſe. But they thought, that more ſolid, ſubſtantial,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012367_0020_0F8925473246F8C0"/>and poſitive evidences of grace were neceſſary for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming ordinance of the LORD'S ſupper, or that they ſhould <hi>bring forth fruits meet for repentance,</hi> before they partook of it. <hi>Matt.</hi> iii. 8.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>C. Mather</hi> ſays, <q>The pureſt churches of the LORD JESUS, have generally not been ſo <hi>large,</hi> or ſo <hi>ſcon</hi> in the adminiſtration of the LORD'S <hi>ſupper,</hi> as of <hi>baptiſm.</hi> One has been given as milk; when the other like <hi>ſtrong meat.</hi> has been withheld; and the ancients uſually detained the <hi>baptized</hi> a while before they were confirmed. <note n="*" place="bottom">Companion for Communicants, p. 34.</note>
               </q> 3d. If after all they were really unregenerate, they held their <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> was no <hi>nullity</hi> to them or their children, but of uſe in various reſpects.</p>
            <p>Before I leave this head, I cannot help expreſſing my ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe to hear the names of ſeveral Miniſters mentioned as patroniſing the contrary ſcheme, when it is notoriouſly known that the ſentiments of <hi>moſt</hi> of them were as large as ours with reſpect to the ſubject of baptiſm; and I rather think it was ſo as to <hi>all</hi> of them, except Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> who was too apt to run into extremes. Though I acknowledge, that none of them agree with Mr. <hi>Stoddard's</hi> notion of the ſacraments being <hi>converting ordinances;</hi> neither did the <hi>Syned,</hi> that intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced this practice into our churches. This, by the way, leads me to obſerve, that there are too controverſies blended in this diſpute, which ſhould be carefully ſeparated, though there is no occaſion for me to do it at preſent, as both parties agree in this, that baptiſm is of larger extent than the LORD'S ſupper.</p>
            <p>Here for further clearing this point, we may obſerve.</p>
            <p n="1">1 ſt. That though baptiſm be a ſeal of the covenant of grace; yet, as grace reſpects ſinners, the virtue and efficacy of it is not confined to regenerate perſons only. The ſacraments are ſeals of the whole covenant; baptiſm particularly is a ſeal in theſe reſpects. 1 ſt. It is a ſeal of memberſhip, a badge of diſcipleſhip, to diſtinguiſh GOD'S profeſſing people from the world. 2d. It is a ſeal of the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>reality</hi> of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; it exhibits to ſinners the <hi>certainty</hi> of a way of mercy. Circumciſion which was of the ſame nature with baptiſm is called <hi>a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of faith. Rom.</hi> iv. 2. That is, a ſeal of CHRIST'S <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> which is apprehended and applied by <hi>faith;</hi> it aſſures us, that there is ſuch a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs provided for the relief of miſerable ſinners, and ſeals the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012367_0021_0F8925474E44FC10"/>efficacy of it unto ſalvation: How encouraging then is this, to draw forth an act of faith? In circumciſion and baptiſm the <hi>truth</hi> of the convenant is ſealed, which is a great means to beget in the ſoul a <hi>perſuaſion</hi> of the truth of it. "And if a man be but convinced of theſe things" ſays Mr. <hi>Stoddard,</hi> he is gained." <q>The ſacraments, ſays another, are not properly ſeals of <hi>the truth of our faith,</hi> but of the truth of the convenant; they are only ſeals of our faith by conſequence, becauſe as ſeals confirm a thing, ſo faith is confirmed and ſtrengthened by receiving; but they are not, in a proper ſenſe, ſeals unto any thing but the covenant. <note n="*" place="bottom">

Many Divines hold, that baptiſm is a ſacrament for the <hi>begetting of life</hi> in elect infants; it is doubtleſs ſo to the children of the faithful, that die in their infancy. But as for thoſe that grow up, it is a ſeal at leaſt that they ſhall not only have <hi>the offer of</hi> CHRIST, but the <hi>ſtriving of his Spirit;</hi> which if not reſiſted will prove effectual to their converſion. And what an advantage is even this? <q>The LORD will as aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, ſays one, ingraff us into CHRIST and cloath us with his righteouſneſs, as we have the outward waſhing, if we deprive not ourſelves thereof by our own careleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <note n="†" place="bottom">Leigh, <hi>p. 918.</hi>

And it even ſeals theſe to the unregenerate, though not <hi>abſolutely,</hi> but <hi>conditionally.</hi> In all theſe reſpects baptiſm is a ſeal to regenerate perſons, and in moſt of them it may be a ſeal to the unregenerate, and ſo of great uſe to them through the bleſſing of GOD. Circumciſion was a ſeal to <hi>Abraham</hi> of ſaving mercies, but not ſo to <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and perhaps not ſo to ſundry others of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s family, which was numerous. In regard of theſe latter, it was a ſeal only in part; that is, of the other things I juſt mentioned, which muſt be acknowledged to be a great benefit. Why then ſhould we be ſo anxious to exclude every unregenerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from this ſeal?</p>

2d. Though baptiſm and the LORD'S ſupper be ſeals of the ſame covenant, yet there is to impropriety of adminiſtring the one ſometime before the other. And this in two caſes eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;

                  <item>1ſt.

            </p>
            <p n="3">3d. If grace be abſolutely neceſſary in order to baptiſm, what inference can be more juſt, and even ratural, than this? <hi>Then I muſt certainly know that I have grace before I come to this ordinance, or bring my children.</hi> This conſequence hangs like <hi>a dead weight</hi> upon this opinion, and can never be got over. All the talk about <hi>prevailing hopes,</hi> or any leſſer degree of evidence ſtill ſerves to make the contradiction the more glaring. Without I am ſure, I have no buſineſs to come; the ordinance is not for me. All the <hi>hopes</hi> in the world never gave a man any right to one privilege, civil or ſacred; it is the <hi>qualification of itſelf</hi> and our being able to make out with <hi>certainty</hi> that we have it, that intitles us.</p>
            <p>But if I ſhould grent for arguments ſake that a leſſer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of evidence will do, how high muſt it riſe? If it be <hi>prevailing hopes,</hi> what muſt become of the believer that hath <hi>preponderating fears?</hi> Surely he muſt ſtay away.

Surely none but thoſe who abſolutely know that they are unconverted; and we ſhall find but ſew that will own that, or that are wholly deſtitute of <hi>hopes.</hi> So that the door is opened as wide for almoſt every body to come as the moſt ſanguine of Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi>'s followers could wiſh.

            <p n="7">7th.

            <p>The caſe of <hi>infants</hi> plainly ſhews it to be the divine pleaſure, that ſome <hi>unregenerates</hi> ſhould be baptized; for he requires it to be done if they are under the covenant, and yet it is his pleaſure at the ſame time not to give them, that is, moſt of them, the grace of the covenant, though there be no reſiſtance or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition on their parts. And it is the divine pleaſure likewiſe that the church ſhould be ſo conſtituted, that of neceſſity we are obliged to receive many adult <hi>unregenerates</hi> into it, let us be ever ſo careful and cautious. This thought purſued in its full latitude, and the genuine conſeqences from it duely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, methinks might <hi>caſe the ſcruples</hi> of any, about admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring the ordinance to ſuch as give but ſtander evidences of grace: A prevailing fear of their unregeneracy ſhould not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens

This leads me to ſay.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, and upon the whole here, I apprehend none of the church would be uneaſy if perſons of ſome regular lives and behaviour could be admitted to bring their children, though ſuch as are of a contrary character be excluded. Here pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhould direct, and caution ſhould be uſed not to proſtitute the ordinances to unmeet ſubjects. That <hi>profane perſons</hi> are out of the queſtion is granted by all. And if ſuch ſhould be ſhut out, it would remove the <hi>repreach</hi> of our having fallen from the method propoſed by the <hi>Synod,</hi> who firſt brought in this practice into theſe churches. Which if true, is more owing to the <hi>careleſneſs</hi> of Miniſters, than to <hi>an alteration</hi> of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
            <p n="10">X. It has been ſuggeſted. <q>That the method we have been in has a tendency to hurt the candidates that offer themſelves by promoting <hi>a careleſs ſecure ſpirit,</hi> which may be fatal to their beſt intereſt.</q> This I rather think true of the contrary ſcheme. When a Miniſter hath peremptorily declared, that no unregenerate perſon ought to come to either ſacrament, and hath charged them upon their peril not to come, and yet ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to urge particular candidates for baptiſm immediately to come to the LORD'S ſupper is as much as to tell them that <hi>he is fully ſatisfied they have grace,</hi> though he doth not ſay ſo in words. And what is the tendency of this but to make them eaſy in their preſent condition without further examination? The corrupt hearts of many will flatter them laſt enough with <hi>hopes,</hi> and having the <hi>Miniſter's ſanction</hi> to back them, they will be in the utmoſt danger of being ſtaked down in delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. It has been ſuggeſted further. <q>That we received this practice by <hi>tradition</hi> from our Fathers without <hi>examination,</hi> and have gone on in a <hi>looſe way</hi> without being able to give any good reaſon for it.</q> I anſwer, that neither our Fathers introduced it, nor we received it in this light manner. The queſtion was ſtarted in the country ſoon after <hi>grand-children</hi> were born to the firſt comers, and the point agitated for twenty or thirty years by the ableſt Divines, until at laſt the <hi>Synod</hi> of all the Miniſters and churches, came to a ſolemn deciſion about it in the year 1662, after much prayer, ſtudy, and converſe, and
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012367_0025_0F89254BD4B763F8"/>gave ſuch weighty reaſons for it as were never yet anſwered.<note n="*" place="bottom">I ſuppoſe one main reaſon why <hi>Plymouth</hi> church did not join the <hi>Synod</hi> was, becauſe they were without a Miniſter ten years together about that time; but the <hi>Synod</hi>'s principles were certainly agreeable to ſome of the church as appears by the pious Secretary <hi>Morton</hi>'s mentioning Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi>'s dying ſpeech with approbation in the <hi>New-England</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial, wherein Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> lament<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Perhaps the reaſon why they did not practiſe upon it was, becauſe none of this ſort applied to have their children baptized. I find no motion toward it in the church-records.</note> Neither did many of their poſterity receive it thus lightly: Mr. <hi>Leonard</hi> in particular had occaſion and thoroughly ſtudied the controverſy, as appeared by ſeveral ſermons on the point; and the ſame may be ſaid of many others. And I am ſorry there is ſuch occaſion to retort the argument; I am perſuaded it is owing to the <hi>ſuperficial</hi> remarks of ſome of our <hi>younger Divines,</hi> lately appearing in print, that this practice has been queſtioned, when as they had never thoroughly ſtudied the <hi>grounds</hi> and <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> our <hi>Fathers</hi> went upon, or even the point of <hi>infant bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> which gives great light to the controverſy, and is really the <hi>foundation</hi> it is built upon, ſo that they muſt both ſtand or fall together.</p>
            <p n="12">XII and laſtly. The expedient to reconcile us, <hi>viz. For the perſons in queſtion to be admitted to full communion, and then for the church to diſpenſe with their coming to the</hi> LORD'S <hi>table for a while.</hi> I ſay this expedient propoſed by the Paſtor is quite unſatisfactory to me. For.</p>
            <p n="1">Iſt. This ſcheme goes upon this ſuppoſition, that <hi>by renewing covenant they are made members,</hi> which is wrong as I have prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before. All <hi>baptized</hi> perſons are members, whether they renew covenant or no, and are under obligations to all chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian duties. This renewing covenant is never thought to make perſons members in other caſes: When a church is embodied in a new pariſh they enter into covenant anew, but are no more members than before; and juſt ſo it is when churches renew covenant in order to promote a reformation.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. The term of <hi>members in full communion</hi> has been always appropriated to perſons who <hi>immediately</hi> communicate, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh them from thoſe who do not communicate, though in
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012367_0026_0F89254D6402B830"/>other reſpects they are equally members. But b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> this new propoſed method all diſtinction will be confounded, and to be members in full communion and not in full communion will be the ſame thing, which, as I obſerved will be a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in terms; and it will make ſuch confuſion in language, that when we become habituated to this practice we ſhould not be able to underſtand one anothers ſpeech when converſing with thoſe of another town about members in full communion. And what difficulty would it cauſe about a form of diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and recommendation, in caſe any of theſe new ſort of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſhould remove to other towns before they communicated?

               </gap> Surely we have need of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Synod</hi> to adviſe, before we raſhly run into this new ſcheme.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. This I look upon to be a right <hi>Popiſo</hi> diſpenſation, <hi>viz.</hi> a diſpenſing with the command of GOD, which is one of the worſt things that we charge upon the <hi>Remiſh</hi> church. The utmoſt the church can do is <hi>paſſively</hi> to connive at thoſe who are kept away by fears and ſcruples, and not to lay any cenſure upon them, which is the caſe according to the preſent mode. But to give open toleration, by an <hi>actual</hi> vote, for members to come or ſtay away at their pleaſure is unjuſtifiable by any rules of ſcripture or reaſon.</p>
            <p n="4">4th. If our baptized members ſhould be averſe to this new method, as I rather think they will, and none ſhould come, it will be juſt the ſame thing as if no door was opened to them at all: Or if they ſhould like it, and ſhould come in multitude<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="5">5th. How long muſt we <hi>ſtay</hi> with theſe new ſort of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers?
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:012367_0027_0F89254E0FC51C00"/>If they are limited to a <hi>certain time</hi> which they are not to exceed, then the church muſt cenſure them if they do not come within that time.

               </gap>e when they think proper, this would be to leave the matter juſt as it is now, and they may ſtay away as long as upon the other ſcheme.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, this would give the Miniſter a <hi>warrant</hi> the more frequently to call upon them, I anſwer, not more warrant than he has by the preſent method. For theſe perſons in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting promiſe to <hi>uſe diligence in their preparations for an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to the</hi> LORD<hi>'S table:</hi> And what better ground can a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter or others have to ſtir them up to ſuch preparations?</p>
            <p n="6">6th. This method has a tendency to deſtroy all order, and to bring in the utmoſt confuſion. For if we diſpeaſe with one, though he hath laid himſelf under immediate obligations to come, we may as well diſpenſe with another, and ſo with all, What then would become of the communion? Even thoſe that are <hi>now</hi> communicants may think themſelves warranted by ſuch liberty given to abſent themſelves when they pleaſe: And how know we but by and by the effect of it may be that we ſhould have no communicants at all? And what a caſe would this be? A church without communicants? Many in full communion, and yet no communion? Members profeſſing to ſerve the LORD in all his ordinances, and yet no ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? What an abſurdity to open ſuch a door as this?</p>
            <p n="7">7th. In this new ſcheme all the ſame difficulties recur, which are objected to the preſent method. This is a <hi>half-way</hi> practice as well as the other: This <hi>divides</hi> the ſeals as well as the other, which has been declared "unwarrantable and unlawful:" This equally encourages unregenerate perſons to come: This has a like tendency to keep perſons along in their <hi>miſtakes,</hi> in their doubts and ſcruples as the other mode. This as fully tolerates perſons in living in the <hi>neglect</hi> of "one <hi>eſſential</hi> duty of the covenant," as it is called, as the method propoſed by the <hi>Synod.</hi> In a word, I know of nothing that may be objected againſt the preſent practice but what with equal force militates againſt the <hi>way</hi> propoſed. It is called indeed by a <hi>new name,</hi> but that does not alter the nature of the thing; the ſtyling them members in full communion does not make them one jot the more ſo, than if they owned the covenant in the common form.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:012367_0028_0F89254ED5D49F80"/>
8th. There ſeems to be a downright inconſiſtency in this way of covenanting. They <hi>doubt</hi> whether they <hi>ought</hi> to come to the LORD'S table in their preſent circumſtances, and yet they <hi>muſt</hi> promiſe to come: They are to promiſe it, and then the church will diſpenſe with the performance; or in other words, will allow them to <hi>break their promiſe for a while,</hi> or perhaps as long as they live if the <hi>ſame reaſon</hi> continues, that is, if they do not get over their <hi>doubts</hi> before. How jarring and incoherant does this appear upon the bare mentioning: For my part, I think they had better not <hi>immediately promiſe,</hi> than not to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</hi> Theſe promiſes <hi>in futuro</hi> are looked upon in other caſes as meet evaſions to avoid a preſent duty; like a ſinner's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to repent hereafter, which he has no thoughts of at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. And then further, as they promiſe it to GOD as well as to the church, they muſt have GOD'S <hi>diſpenſation</hi> as well as the church's, or they are obliged to come <hi>immediately,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any thing the church can do. <hi>When thou haſt vowed a vew unto</hi> GOD defer <hi>not to pay it. Eccl.</hi> v. 12.</p>
            <p n="9">9th. The introducing this new ſcheme will either cauſe the wholly laying by <hi>a relation of experiences,</hi> or this new fort of members muſt ſubmit to this practice, or we muſt have two different methods of admitting perſons to full commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: And great inconveniences would ariſe by either of theſe different ways. With reſpect to <hi>relations</hi> I have ſpoken before. I would only add, that if theſe non-communicants in full communion ſhould be obliged to bring a relation, I believe it would as effectually put a ſtop to their coming, as any of the moſt rigid methods the church could poſſibly take: I dare ſay we ſhould have no members of theſe ſort: They would carry their children to other churches that are not ſo ſtrait.</p>
            <p n="10">10th. The moſt material difference between this and the preſent method ſeems to be this, that in the one caſe the convenant is propoſed <hi>twice,</hi> and in the other caſe but <hi>once:</hi> Which, it is ſtrange to me, ſhould occaſion any <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of conſcience,</hi> ſince it only adds to the <hi>ſolemnity</hi> of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, and does but little, if at all, diminiſh their obligations of coming to the LORD'S table; in the one method they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing diligently to ſeek <hi>preparations</hi> for it, and in the other, that they will come when they have got over their ſcruples, and are better ſatisfied that they are prepared for the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; which certainly is the ſame thing in effect: And there is as much danger on the one ſide as the other, of their uſing it
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:012367_0029_0F89254FBA16AE88"/>meerly as a <hi>formality,</hi> eſpecially after a while, to get their children baptized.</p>
            <p>As for the ſuggeſtion, that by this <hi>two-fold repetition</hi> of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, perſons are led into the miſtaken notion, that there are <hi>two different covenants,</hi> and that the firſt is of a <hi>laxer</hi> nature than the laſt: it is impoſſible for a perſon that hears both <hi>forms</hi> read rationally to entertain ſuch a thought; but if any of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſort are in danger of it, they may be eaſily ſet right from the pulpit, or by converſation. As for their being made <hi>twice member;</hi> by it, enough has been ſaid before, when it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that this renewing covenant does not make them mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11th. If the difficulty lies here, <hi>the propoſing of the covenant twice,</hi> as being thought ſuperfluous and unneceſſary, for peace ſake I ſhould not object againſt the firſt propoſing of it being wholly laid aſide; I mean with reſpect to thoſe already in the covenant or perſons baptized; and that they, after being propounded a competent time and no objection made to their lives and morals, ſhould be allowed to bring their children to baptiſm. Though after all I ſhould be ſorry to ſee the church abate any thing from the ſolemnity of the affair, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is of good tendency both in regard of the candidate and ſpectators, and intitles the former to the prayer of the church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the whole, I ſhould be glad of any proper expedient to remove the difficulties among us, and to preſerve peace and harmony; but as for the expedient under conſideration, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee my way clear to come into it at preſent. And if the majority of the church ſhould approve of it, I am afraid that we ſhould become <hi>an object of ridicule</hi> to the whole country for our <hi>ſingularity,</hi> and for our introducing ſuch an inconſiſtent jumbled ſcheme, which was never heard of in the churches before this day; and even now I do not find it ſo much as hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that above one church practiſes any thing like it.</p>

            <head>THE THIRD ESSAY.</head>
            <p>SOME THINGS have occurred to my mind ſince the laſt church-meeting, relating to the ſubjects of baptiſm.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſhall take notice of ſome poſitions that have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, and objections made.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. It is objected, that many make a <hi>formality</hi> of the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice meerly to get their children baptized. Anſwer. I ſear it is too true. But how ſhall this new regulation remedy the difficulty? If this door were entirely ſhut, is there not as much danger of making a <hi>formality</hi> of the LORD'S ſuppot ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than their children ſhould go without baptiſm. But as to ſome there is no doubt they do it not <hi>formally,</hi> but <hi>ſincerely:</hi> And ſhall we keep them away, becauſe others abuſe the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege? For my part, I am of my Great-grandfather <hi>Cotton</hi>'s mind, that <hi>it is better to admit ten bypocrites, than to excluae one ſincere child of</hi> GOD.</p>
            <p>And I would add, if they are ſuch perſons who make a formality of it that chiefly come to renew convenant for their children's ſake, how comes it to paſs that the door is op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ed for their admiſſion to the LORD'S ſupper? For i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> hath been once and again ſaid, that the purport of the new ſcheme is to <hi>enlarge and not to curtail and diminiſh their privileges,</hi> viz. by obliging them to come immediately into full communion.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. It is objected, Mr. <hi>Leonard's</hi> great difficulty in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the practice, and that he w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> anſwer, Mr. <hi>Leonard</hi> was indeed ſo long about it; but the reaſon was not becauſe he could not gain a major vote before; for he had the major part of the church with him, (I think) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> but would wait until he had gained their acquieſcence at leaſt. 2d. In this he acted according to the ancient practice and conſtitution of this church.

               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:012367_0031_0F892551CE70B378"/>
And if any thing may be argued from Mr. <hi>Leonard's</hi> being ſeven years about it, it is this, that we ought to be as long at leaſt in conſidering before we caſt this practice out, proceeding in the ſame gradual manner, and not to do any thing of ſuch importance raſhly and in haſte.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. It is ſaid our Fathers of this church admitted not the practice. I anſwer, they admitted that upon which this prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice is grounded, that is, they admitted all the children of the church to <hi>renew covenant</hi> in a body, and that more than once, without coming to the LORD'S table. Which is further than our Paſtor would have us go. And I appeal to him, after they had gone ſo far, whether they ought not to have gone farther, and baptized their children, as he does now the children of them who have formerly owned the covenant.</p>
            <p>The Rev. Mr. <hi>Thacther</hi> of <hi>Middleborough</hi> after ſuch general renewing of covenant in his church, baptized all their children without any further ſtep; and perhaps our Fathers would have done the ſame, if any of theſe renewers of covenant had appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have their children baptized, which does not appear from the records that ever they did. Further, I find they had high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thoughts of infant's memberſhip than many now a days have; they looked upon them as members; they dealt with them as ſuch; they diſmiſſed and recommended them to other chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches when they removed, and ſent admonitions after them, if not diſmiſſed, when they miſbehaved.</p>
            <p n="4">4th. It is ſaid that none but viſible Chriſtians or Believers, ſhould partake of ſpecial privileges. I readily grant it, and ſay, that all baptized perſons are viſible Chriſtians or Believers, unleſs they carry the Devil's mark, a <hi>profane life,</hi> or are <hi>known infidels.</hi> This and nothing elſe ſhould exclude them from the privilege of baptiſm, if they aſk for it. If we can prove by ſcripture marks to the ſatisfaction of the church, that they are wicked perſons, or if they make an open profeſſion of unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy, that is, know and acknowledge themſelves to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate, we deſire not their admiſſion. It would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous indeed to apply CHRIST'S ſeal to thoſe that are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly the Devil's children, and own themſelves to be ſuch with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any compunctions of conſcience. But if we have only fears and ſcruples about them and cannot ſay but that after all they may have <hi>ſome good thing in them toward the</hi> LORD, an <hi>Abijah</hi> had in the houſe of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> how dare we ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:012367_0032_0F892552959FD7C8"/>
If ſeems to me that the diſtinction between <hi>viſible</hi> and <hi>inviſible</hi> believers is too much blended and confounded in the preſent diſpute. If it is <hi>viſible grace</hi> only that intitles in the ſight of the church, then all the talk about <hi>real grace</hi> is nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5th. It is ſaid, if viſible grace entitles to the ſeals, why ought we to make a diſtinction, and admit ſome to one ordinance and others to both? I anſwer, 1ſt. That it is the candidates them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves generally ſpeaking that make the diſtinction, and not the church; and we ought to admit them to the diſcharge of their duty as far as they ſee light to go, and not to lay ſtumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-blocks in their way. 2d. I am fully of Mr. <hi>Robbins</hi>'s mind, that baptiſm as well as the LORD'S ſupper are ſeals of the convenant of grace. But the conſequence he draws from it I deny, that baptiſm and the LORD'S ſupper are of <hi>equal extent.</hi> It is and has been my ſettled principle and practice, to be more ſtrict in admiſſions to the LORD'S table than to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. And I have the example of almoſt all churches from the beginning to patronize me in it. If there be but a <hi>hare poſſibility</hi> that a perſon has grace, I think he ought not to be excluded from baptiſm for himſelf or children. But <hi>more poſitive evidences</hi> of grace were neceſſary for the LORD'S ſupper. And this for ſeveral reaſons: Theſe two among the reſt;
<list>
                  <item>1ſt. Becauſe bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is a ſacrament of <hi>entrance,</hi> but the LORD'S ſupper a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>growth.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2d. Becauſe if afterwards they were back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliders, it would bring leſs reproach on religion or the church than if they were admitted to full communion.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6th. It is ſaid that the perſons in queſtion have only an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-memberſhip</hi> which differs from that of the adult. I anſwer, it differs not in the <hi>eſſentials</hi> of it. All memberſhip comes by <hi>divine inſtitution;</hi> and is as <hi>real</hi> memberſhip, and as <hi>compleat</hi> in the one as in the other, that is, in the children as in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. <hi>Paul</hi> was as real and compleat a <hi>Roman</hi> citizen as the <hi>Chief Captain,</hi> though the one came to it by <hi>birth</hi> and the other by <hi>purchaſe</hi> at adult age. Original ſin comes in a different manner from other ſins, <hi>viz.</hi> by the mediation of our parents, yet it is as really a ſin <hi>in us</hi> as any that we actually commit. The like may be ſaid in the preſent caſe. But after all, if it be a reproach to have only an infant-memberſhip, we may eaſily take it away by this church's renewing covenant, as our anceſtors d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

II. I ſhall now make ſome OBSERVATIONS for the further clearing the point, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. I think this is a point of the greateſt importance that ever came before this church. The queſtion is, whether our children ſhall be treated as outcaſts, as ſtrangers to the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of promiſe, or in orher words, as Infidels, as Pagans, without GOD in the world and without hope! If the act eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing this practice ſhould be repealed, I ſhould look upon it that all our children are this day unchurched and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, and that the church hath nothing more to do with them in a way of diſcipline. The brethren had need con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what they do before they act: Your children are no doubt dear to you; and will you, blindfold, this day caſt them out of the heritage of the LORD? Will you with your own hands, lifted up to Heaven, <hi>deliver them to Satan?</hi> I cannot poſſibly put any other conſtruction on the matter: They muſt either be within the church or without; either <hi>dogs,</hi> or <hi>lambs of</hi> CHRIST'S <hi>flock:</hi> If they are <hi>within,</hi> that is, members, they are certaily entitled to ſome privilege; and what privilege have they left, if their children muſt not be baptized? Did we not learn this in our earlieſt infancy, <hi>that the enfants of ſuch as are members of the viſible church are to be baptized?</hi> But if they muſt be diſcovenanted and caſt out after all, I cannot help turning myfelf to them, as many ſuch are preſent, and ſaying to ſuch as are of <hi>good converſation,</hi> as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> lxvi. 5. <hi>Your brethren that caſt you out, for my name's ſake, ſaid, let the</hi> LORD <hi>be glorified: but he ſhall appear to your joy, and they ſhall be aſhamed.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">The reaſon of this <hi>apoſtrophe</hi> was, I had been informed of two or three that had applied to own the covenant, but were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, though at the ſame time urged to come to full commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2d. But why are we to do this? The plea or pretence is <hi>grace.</hi> But I dare ſay it will be found a moſt <hi>ungracious</hi> ſcheme in the iſſue: It will bring in a carnal generation into the church, I mean into the number of communicants: other doors being ſhut they will after a while ruſh into it as the horſe to the battle, rather than not have their children bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. And Miniſters and churches will be more <hi>lax</hi> in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, rather than to have a generation of <hi>heathens</hi> growing up among them. This it ſeems begins already to be the caſe, where this alteration takes place, as ſome ſerious people complain.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. I would query, whether it is probable <hi>Abraham</hi> had grounds to think that <hi>all</hi> his numerous family were converted,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:012367_0034_0F892554CEDCF650"/>when they entered into ſolemn covenant? <hi>Gen.</hi> xvii. and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would have been juſtified if upon his fearing the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he had withheld the ſeal from them? <hi>Abraham's</hi> family was the only church in the world, and a type of the goſpel church; and what was done in it, ought to be done in goſpel times. We ſhould not be ſtricter than <hi>Abraham</hi> the <hi>father of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> eſpecially ſince we are in the <hi>ſame covenant</hi> with him. <hi>Rom.</hi> iv. and xi. and <hi>Gel.</hi> iii.</p>
            <p n="4">4th. If this new ſcheme takes place, the next ſtep may be a total laying aſide of <hi>relations.</hi> This it ſeems is done in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut,</hi> by the moſt zealous promoters of this new method. And Mr. <hi>Robbins</hi> owns, that it is matter of indifferency, or at leaſt, that a church may be rightly conſtituted without them: If ſo, they may be laid aſide. And what will be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this? Why, 1ſt. the knowledge of <hi>experiences</hi> will be left to the ſole cognizance of Miniſters: And muſt the church truſt implicitly to them? 2d. The church will have nothing left to judge by, but external evidences. And then, as to many, they will have only <hi>negative</hi> evidences: And as to the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates moſt known, <hi>blameleſneſs</hi> of life will be the ſum total of the evidence. Every one that can ſay with the <hi>Phariſee, I am no extertioner, unjuſt,</hi> &amp;c. or with the young man, <hi>all theſe have I kept,</hi> &amp;c. muſt be admitted to the LORD'S ſupper. What then will become of the ſcheme of <hi>real grace</hi> being eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial? Or how will they free themſelves from inconſiſtency, as I noted before?</p>
            <p n="5">5th. I would obſerve, that the <hi>Synod</hi> were of the ſame mind with Mr. <hi>Robbins,</hi> that it is <hi>real grace</hi> that entitles a perſon to the ordinances in the ſight of GOD, and that it is <hi>viſible grace</hi> that entitles them in the ſight of the church; and yet they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred baptiſm in this latitude: They could ſee no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency between theſe things; and how came we at this day to be more clear-ſighted?</p>
            <p n="6">6th. Further, with reſpect to the <hi>Synod</hi> that introduced this practice <hi>generally,</hi> (for it was introduced by ſome particular Miniſters and churches before) I would obſerve two things.
<list>
                  <item>1ſt. The famous Miniſters that came into the country at the firſt ſettlement were moſt of them alive and preſent at the <hi>Synod.</hi> and moſtly joined in it. And thoſe that were dead, as my Great-grandfather Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sheppard,</hi> and others, were for it, as appears by their writings. And as for thoſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that oppoſed the <hi>Synod,</hi> they afterwards almoſt to a man ſell in with it, inſomuch that Mr. <hi>Mitchell</hi> in his letter to D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="31" facs="unknown:012367_0035_0F89255606131978"/>
                     <hi>Inc. Mather,</hi> five years after the <hi>Synod,</hi> tells him that he was <hi>leſt almoſt alone:</hi> And he afterwards fell in; from what motives his writings tell.</item>
                  <item>2d. I think it an obſervation of ſome weight, that the <hi>temptation</hi> that lay before our Fathers was rather to be too <hi>rigid</hi> than <hi>lax</hi> in admiſſions.</item>
               </list>
For they were juſtly and greatly offended with the church of <hi>England,</hi> from which they had juſt broke away, for their admitting every one, yea the profaneſt to goſpel ordinances, as members of the national church. This is one of the reaſons they always give of their ſeperation, <hi>viz. promiſcuous adminiſtrations:</hi> And yet they ſo far got over their prejudices as to come into ſuch a reſult as we have in the <hi>Synod-Book.</hi> And as to Mr. <hi>Davenport</hi> in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, the grand oppoſer of the <hi>Synod,</hi> we find in his life, that he was not only prejudiced by the looſe adminiſtrations in the church of <hi>England,</hi> but by what he ſaw in <hi>Holland,</hi> when he was Miniſter there; they requiring his baptizing <hi>all children</hi> belonging to his aſſembly, let their parents or guardians be eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſo <hi>ignorant</hi> or <hi>ſcandalous,</hi> which he refuſing, was forced to leave his miniſtry among them. And he was afraid if he joined with the <hi>Synod</hi> it would come to this at length in <hi>New-England.</hi> As to Preſident <hi>Chauncy</hi> the other great oppoſer of the <hi>Synod,</hi> (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Miniſter of this church) we know how <hi>rigid</hi> he was about the <hi>dipping</hi> of infants; he would neither baptize them in the common way himſelf, nor ſuffer it to be done by other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, which occaſioned his leaving this place. No wonder then that he was as <hi>rigid</hi> in the preſent caſe. Theſe two with Dr. <hi>Inc. Mather,</hi> were the chief oppoſers and writers againſt the <hi>Synod;</hi> but Dr. <hi>Mather</hi> altered his mind, as you have heard.</p>
            <p n="7">7th. I think it a good obſervation of the worthy and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Mr. <hi>Neal,</hi> who was formerly in <hi>New-England,</hi> (but now or lately a Miniſter in <hi>London</hi>) in his <hi>New-England</hi> Hiſtory, ſpeaking of the <hi>Synod</hi> in 1662 he ſays, <q>I muſt confeſs, for my own part, that it looks but like an odd aſſertion to me to call a perſon <hi>a member of a church,</hi> who hath no right to any of its <hi>privileges,</hi> and yet remains expoſed to its <hi>cenſures.</hi>
               </q> A ſtrange ſort of memberſhip indeed!</p>
            <p n="8">8<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h. If the church muſt be purged in this ſort, that is, ſo conſiderable a number of members muſt be declared uncapable of any privilege, and in effect diſcovenanted, I would move that the church would begin higher in this purging work. Let us begin with the communicants; let all be examined; let them be aſked one by one <hi>whether they have grace,</hi> or <hi>whether they love the</hi> LORD JESUS <hi>in ſincerity?</hi> And if they have not
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:012367_0036_0F89255793B94160"/>aſſurance of this, or good evidence, let them be rendered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of any privilege or diſcovenanted until it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with them. In a word, let us turn down-right <hi>Separates,</hi> and ſet up a pure church, this would be acting conſiſtently, and not turning our artillery againſt the weaker part of the members only.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, As to the manner the church ſhould act in this affair. I would aſk the members, as it were one by one, whether they can ſay upon their conſciences and according to the word of GOD, that the practice is wrong and erroneous, or in other words, that it ſprung from Hell? If the major part can ſay this without any doubt or heſitation upon their minds, I would aſk further, what right the ſcripture gives them to impoſe their ſentiments upon their fellow-members, who think the practice agreeable to the will of GOD? Ought there not rather to be ſome way found out in which our conſciences may remain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violate, and none of our chriſtian rights invaded, and we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in communion together in charity and love? And is not the method I propoſed at the laſt church-meeting of this nature?</p>
            <p>Whether the major part of the church be for or againſt the practice I know not, having converſed with but few. But if any alteration takes place, I apprehend two things neceſſary.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. That thoſe who vote for the alteration ſhould have clear evidence, if not aſſurance of their own regenerate eſtate. The new plan ſuppoſes it neceſſary that all candidates for baptiſm or the LORD'S ſupper have ſuch evidence. And ſhall candidates be excluded by thoſe who have it not themſelves? As our Saviour ſaid, <hi>He that is without ſin let him caſt the firſt ſtone;</hi> ſo I ſay, let him that hath good evidence of his own gracious ſtate <hi>caſt a ſtone</hi> at our baptized members; and let none elſe preſume to do it by voting in this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aſe. If they do they condemn themſelves; they pull the <hi>mote</hi> out of their brother's eye, and leave the <hi>beam</hi> in their own, contrary to our Saviour's command; they require that of others, which their conſciences tell them they are deſtitute of themſelves. And what an abſurdity is this? What a preſumption? What a ſelf-condemning mark? It was to ſuch caſes as this the Apoſtle had reference in <hi>Rom.</hi> ii. 1. <hi>Therefore thou art inexcuſable, O man, whoſoever thou art that judgeſt; for wherein thou judgeſt another thou condemneſt thyſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2d. The other thing neceſſary is, that the church ſhould be unanimous in the alteration, at leaſt that all oppoſition ſhould ceaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:012367_0037_0F89255888E7FFB0"/>
Our church records inform us, <q>That before any vote was called in affairs of importance, care was always taken to gain the conſent of every Brother: And in caſe any could not actually vote; yet expreſſing, that they could reſt in the act of the church, it was ſatisfying: And this was a great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the peace of the church.</q> This is the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the church. How then can this practice be aboliſhed, when about half the church at leaſt, are zealous for it? This would be an impoſition with a witneſs; ſuch as was never heard of, ſince the church had a foundation.</p>
            <p>But how is it poſſible then, that this affair ſhould ever be ſettled? I anſwer, it can be ſettled no other way, than by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual toleration and forbearance. The church may, if they think proper, paſſively acquieſce in Mr. <hi>Robins's forbearing the practice,</hi> until he hath more light to act in the affair. This is the utmoſt that they can do, without a general concurrence and conſent, or while our different ſentiments remain.</p>
            <p>And if the church thus far condeſcend to Mr. <hi>Robbins,</hi> I think at leaſt he ought as far to condeſcend to thoſe of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent apprehenſions; that is, by paſſively acquieſing at baptiſm being adminiſtred among us by other Miniſters, as has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready propoſed, and not to imitate Mr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> in his rigid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or lay ſtumbling blocks in the way to prevent or diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Miniſters coming. Thus by mutual forbearance, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair may be peaceably accommodated, and no violation of conſcience on either ſide. But if the matter be drove on with violence, who can tell what the conſequence will be: GOD only knows.</p>
            <p>And I would finally ſay, that if a vote of repeal be obtained, it would be <hi>null</hi> in itſelf, unleſs by a <hi>previous vote</hi> the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the church be altered, and a new conſtitution eſtabliſhed, wherein the major part ſhould have a right granted them of <hi>ruling the conſciences of their Brethren;</hi> which GOD forbid ſhould ever be the fate of this once famous, but now declining church. AMEN.</p>

And on the whole, I am ſtill of the ſame mind I was, that what you read in your <hi>laſt Puce</hi> was a moſt <hi>injurious, unchriſtian, ungentleman-like, groſs miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentation</hi> of the ſentiments of your brethren who are on the other ſide of the queſtion in debate.

Neither can I in conſcience encourage the INSTRUCTIONS of thoſe who hold and advance ſuch doctrines among a people, the charge of whoſe immortal intereſts is committed to me. The <hi>direct</hi> and <hi>unavoidable</hi> tendency of your <hi>opinions,</hi> as they have been here diſcovered, appears to me to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the grand <hi>calviniſtic</hi> doctrines of the goſpel, and to eſtabliſh the moſt dangerous tenets of the <hi>Arminians.</hi> For, notwithſtanding any precaution you can uſe, they will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably be led to think there is ſomething in a graceleſs finner that is pleaſing to GOD; that he is not quite ſo bad as many have repreſented him; that he is not an utter enemy to GOD and CHRIST and the covenant, but has <hi>ſame</hi> good thing in him, at leaſt, towards the LORD GOD of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But it is needleſs for me to enlarge on this head at preſent. The <hi>moſt godly</hi> amongſt us plainly ſee theſe to be the conſequences of your arguments and plan, as it has been hitherto puſhed. For, whatever may be urged, it is too evident that thoſe who do in theſe days practiſe the <hi>half-covenant</hi> or encourage baptized children owning covenant, &amp;c. in the common way, have wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly deviated and gone off from the original deſign of
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:012367_0041_0F8925616814CDA0"/>the <hi>Synod.</hi> But enough has been ſaid of this in publick. As to the poor plea of making <hi>Pagans, Heathens, &amp;c.</hi> of our children, it appears to me it is as <hi>wicked</hi> as it is <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable</hi> to call thoſe who have been born and brought up under the goſpel, and ſtill enjoy ordinances, calls, means of grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to call them, I ſay, <hi>Pagans,</hi> meerly becauſe they are deſtitute of the outward badge, though <hi>precious privilege</hi> I own, of <hi>diſcipleſhip,</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">If baptized perſons are <hi>diſciples,</hi> then they ought to have the privilege, the <hi>precious privilege</hi> of <hi>all</hi> diſciples, <hi>viz,</hi> to have their children baptized as well as themſelves.</note> that is, remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized!

                  <p>I WILL not be led into a paper controverſy; neither my preſent hurry of buſineſs, nor inclination will permit it. One anſwer for all. I read your long Epiſtle with aſtoniſhment and ſurprize, and all the while I was reading, my conſcience told me, <hi>that I was not the man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You repreſent my diſcourſe at the church-meeting as a meer <hi>popular harangue</hi> and <hi>appeal to men's paſſions,</hi> as if this was the main ſcope and ſubſtance of it. I have looked it over careſully and find little of this nature contained in it. It conſiſts of eleven pages, and about ten of thoſe eleven are taken up in reaſoning cloſely, as I thought, on the point, or in relating matter of fact reſpecting the <hi>Synod,</hi> Mr. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venport,</hi> Mr. <hi>Leonard, &amp;c.</hi> or in declaring the conſtitution of the church, and what was proper for the church to do in the matter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And I ſcarce know what you refer to, except it be what I ſaid about our children's being excommunicated, and my quoting <hi>Iſa.</hi> lxvi. 5. As to the latter, you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that I addreſſed thoſe baptized perſons only who were of <hi>good converſation,</hi> not the profane; and herein I had reſpect particularly to Mr. <hi>Ichabed S—w,</hi> and one or two more, whom I had heard you would not admit to own the covenant, and yet were willing to receive to full communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It was, I ſuppoſe, my mentioning this text, that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions your aſſerting that I was free in dealing out implicitly the curſes in GOD'S Book upon thoſe who thought different<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from me, for I find nothing elſe that looks that way. Whether any curſes were thus denounced, a brief paraphraſe of the text will diſcover: It runs thus, <hi>your Brethren that (hated you and;</hi> theſe words I left out becauſe in no ſenſe
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:012367_0043_0F892563D7640980"/>applicable) <hi>caſt you out;</hi> (this was really the caſe in my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion) <hi>ſaid, let the</hi> LORD <hi>he glorified.</hi> This is the very thing you urge, that the new ſcheme is for the glory of GOD. <hi>But he ſhall appear to your joy.</hi> (That is, Providence will keep the door open for your admitance) <hi>and they ſhall be aſhamed.</hi> That is, they ſhall be <hi>convined</hi> of their error in being ſo ſtrait, and <hi>conviction</hi> is always accompanied with <hi>ſhame.</hi> This was my real intent and meaning in uſing this text, and the ſenſe, I believe, in which the hearers ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally took it. But taking the text in a greater latitude, I do not ſee how it can be called a <hi>dealing out of</hi> GOD'S <hi>curſes</hi> againſt you or your adherents. As to the propriety of my mentioning this text, (in the alluſive ſenſe in which it was meant and taken) I have not the leaſt doubt. But as to the <hi>prudence</hi> of it, that is another queſtion: It might perhaps be an <hi>imprudent</hi> ſtep becauſe it tended rather to irritate than enlighten. As to my charging you with ſentiments, which I know you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, I know not what you mean, except my ſaying, <q>The new plan ſuppoſes it neceſſary that all candidates for baptiſm or the LORD'S ſupper have clear evidence, if not aſſurance of their regenerate eſtate.</q> Whether you hold this or not, let your Sermons ſpeak; except one, |wherein you endeavoured to remove the ſcruple ariſing from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 29. In which you brought down the terms ſo <hi>low,</hi> that ſcarce any need be afraid of coming. How you can reconcile this to your other Diſcourſes, I know not.</p>
                  <p>If you further mean, that I charge you with a <hi>direct deſign</hi> of excommunicating the children of the church: I charge you with no ſuch thing; but that it is the direct conſequence of your opinion, I then and now, and I believe always ſhall aſſert. And I held up this conſequence before you, that you might ſee the abſurdity of your opinion. What can be more natural than ſuch reaſoning as this? <q>If the act eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing this practice ſhould be repealed, I ſhould look upon it that all our children are this day unchurched and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, and that the church hath nothing more to do with them in a way of diſcipline. I cannot poſſibly put any other conſtruction on the matter: They muſt either be within the church or without; either <hi>dogs,</hi> or <hi>lambs</hi> of CHRIST'S flock: If they are <hi>within,</hi> that is, members, they are certainly entitled to ſome privilege; and what privilege have they left, if their children muſt not be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized? Did we not learn this in our earlieſt infancy, <hi>That
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:012367_0044_0F892564AA0A7B50"/>The infants of ſuch as are members of the viſible church are to be baptized.</hi>
                     </q> You yourſelf muſt neceſſarily ſee the force of this way of reaſoning, and would readily own the conſequence to be unavoidable, if baptized perſons adult were members of the church. But this you now deny, although you own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it in all our church-meetings formerly;<note n="*" place="bottom">Which is the reaſon why I never yet attempted fully to prove that point.</note> and you muſt of neceſſity deny it, to be conſiſtent. And in this you accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany Mr. <hi>Davenport</hi> and a few others formerly, and Mr. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamy</hi> and ſome more in our day, though contrary to the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of all churches and almoſt all Divines in all ages.</p>
                  <p>You ſay, that you think the cauſe I maintained will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer by my managament of it: If ſo, ſo much the better for you. You ſay, you mean not to attempt to terrify or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighten me: I am not ſo eaſily affrighted out of my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. You ſay, that <hi>the moſt experienced Chriſtians</hi> among us are on your ſide. Anſ. I do not pretend to judge the heart; but I apprehend you are miſtaken here. And in your compariſons, I think you are guilty of great unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs and cenſoriouſneſs; and I muſt in faithfulneſs tell you that I verily fear, you converſe <hi>too-little</hi> with your flock to paſs any judgment who are the moſt godly and experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Chriſtians, or who enjoy moſt of the preſence of GOD and the ſweetneſs of religion. You ſay, that you do not think there are four women in the whole church with me. If this be true, which I queſtion, this ſhews that you are more a favourite with the women than I am, but does not prove your point. And here I would obſerve, as far as my knowledge reaches, or I have information, that there are very few, if any, men or women, but would be eaſy and contented to have the practice continued, if they were not afraid of grieving or loſing you. You ſay, "that it perfectly accords with the pride of the unregenerate heart, to hear that baptiſm in infancy and negative evidences are ſufficient gound for chriſtian charity." What I aſtert is, that negative evidences are ſo far ſufficient, that if a baptized perſons, of whom the church knows nothing amiſs, ſhould deſire to own the covenant, or in other words, to take poſſeſſion of the right given him in baptiſm, the church could not regularly deny him. Is this ſuch a dangerous doctrine as you repreſent, and attended with ſuch dreadful conſequences?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="unknown:012367_0045_0F892565543B0BF0"/>
You add, "it ſuits graceleſs perſons ſpedial well to be told, that unregenerate men may ſafely ſay they avouch the Lord for their God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>" I did not uſe the word <hi>unregenerate;</hi> but what I ſaid was, that a man may ſafely ſay it, who has p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

He <hi>avencheth the</hi> LORD <hi>for his</hi> GOD, while he verily thought himſelf unregenerate. He did this upon account of his covenant relation, or early dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to GOD in circumciſion. And ſuppoſe any other ſinner, ſenſibly diſtreſſed like him, ſhould uſe the like words, while he thought himſelf deſtitute of grace, would this be a profanation? Or would it lay a foundation for him to build <hi>falſe hopes</hi> upon? A mighty foundation indeed! The premiſes are, GOD <hi>is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this was not done ſuddenly in a paſſion upon the breaking up of the church-meeting, for which ſome allowance might be made, but deliberately after three or four days conſideration, and immediately after a day of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Faſting and Prayer, in which we might juſtly expect our paſſions would be compoſed.

                  <p>This with you is a ſufficient foundation for chriſtian cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, without any knowledge of their experiences, that is, on the part of the church. Here then I might exclaim, <q>This per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly accords with the natural pride of the unregenerate heart, and their ſelf juſtifying ſpirit; this reliſhes exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly with the generality of men to hear that baptiſm
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:012367_0047_0F892566CCA0CDA8"/>with profeſſion and a moral regular practice are enough to ground a chriſtian charitable belief that ſuch perſons are good folks, and may be admitted to <hi>covenant</hi> with GOD: Whence they will naturally conclude their ſtate is ſafe enough, in ſpite of all the miniſterial inſtructions that can be given them!</q> And ſo as to all the reſt of the dreadful conſequences, which you attribute to my ſcheme. Mr. <hi>Robbins,</hi> Who is the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian</hi> now? When experiences are ſet aſide, what is all this but <hi>arminian evidence?</hi> But be not affrighted; after all, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you nor I are <hi>Arminians.</hi> But all this <hi>rhapſody</hi> ſprung from a ſtrange confuſion of ideas, or from not duly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing between what is proper evidence for the church to act upon, and what for the party or candidate himſelf, which are certainly dificient, at leaſt in part, as I doubt not you will acknowledge, when you come to conſider.</p>
                  <p>You further ſay, that <q>Miniſters and churches in theſe days have wretchedly deviated from the deſign of the <hi>Synod.</hi>
                     </q> If this be the caſe, which I queſtion, why did you not endeavour to reſtore the practice to the original de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of it, and not ſeek the total abolition of it? This, I doubt not, might have been eaſily effected without one church-meeting. It lay entirely in your own breaſt whom to propound or not, and I make no doubt you would have been ſo large in your <hi>practical charity,</hi> however ſtrict in your <hi>notional</hi> or <hi>ſpeculative,</hi> that there would have been but little objection; but few perſons, I believe, eſpecially thoſe of note, would have been excluded: But it ſeems the door is ſhut againſt every one, let him be <hi>ever ſo well qualified,</hi> unleſs he ſees his way clear to come to the LORD'S table. How in this caſe you can read ſuch texts as that, <hi>Matt.</hi> xviii. 6, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trembling, I cannot imagine. And here I would adviſe you not to keep perpetually harping upon <hi>qualifications,</hi> as if this was the chief point in diſpute: If this was yielded to you, another grand point remains, Whether it be not ſinful to exclude any from the privilege of baptiſm whom we could charitably receive to the LORD'S ſupper, meerly becauſe they ſcruple their fitneſs for that ordinance? This I look upon as a greater point than the other.</p>
                  <p>You next charge me with <hi>wickedneſs</hi> in calling them <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> who were never baptized or made any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, although they come to meeting, or have opportunity for it if they will. Wherein the <hi>wickedneſs</hi> of this conſiſts, I know nor: Divines frequently do it. Mr <hi>Watſon,</hi> in his

You almoſt every Sabbath make them <hi>worſe</hi> than <hi>Heathen,</hi> in ſaying, <hi>they ſhall have a more aggravated doom.</hi> Yea, if I remember right, you either in direct terms or in effect called them <hi>Heathens</hi> in treating from <hi>Jer.</hi> x. 25. But ſuppoſing the phraſe <hi>improper,</hi> how can it juſtly be called <hi>wicked?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for your concluding triumphs, as if certain of the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and that your ſcheme will finally prevail; read 1 <hi>Kings,</hi> xx. 11. But I hope it is not victory that either ſide is ſeeking; but truth. There are ſome other things in your Letter that deſerve animadverſion; but I forbear.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole. I look upon your Letter as a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian and injurious reflection on me and on a great part of the church; and as you profeſs yourſelf a Chriſtian, I think myſelf in duty bound to demand ſatisfaction for the following articles.

                        <hi>P. S.</hi> I cannot but think, that <hi>one deſign</hi> of your writing this Letter, and the <hi>timing</hi> of it, was to prevent my coming to the <hi>ſacrament;</hi> ſo that you have begun to <hi>purge</hi> the church already, as is indeed acceſſary upon your plan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And I am really ſuſpicious, that you had a further reach in this Letter than barely to vent your reſentment. Mr. <hi>Robbins,</hi> let me aſk you ſeriouſly, Have you not a mind to get away from poor <hi>Plymouth?</hi> And have you not ſome favourite pariſh in view? I would not be uncharitable; but your ſeveral <hi>provoking</hi> Letters to the Precinct Committee about your ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary, without juſt grounds; the open declaration of your Brother; ſome hints of the ſame nature from your Father; your refuſing any method of accommodation; your manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the church-meeting, and eſpecially this laſt ſtroke, which aflects not me only, but above half the church and congregation. I ſay, all theſe give grounds of ſuſpicion, that there is ſomething of that nature in view; I cannot otherwiſe account for your conduct.</p>
                     <p>I deſire to know how it comes about that ſix or ſeven lines of your Father's Letter to me are eraſed. It is not done with the ſame ſort of ink that your Father uſed, but with ink exactly reſembling your Letter. Are ſuch proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings fair or handſome? If you ſend any account to <hi>Connecticut,</hi> I deſire you would ſend a full copy of your and my Letter, and not let it go in that hideous dreſs in which it has been hitherto repreſented.</p>
                     <p>Looking over your Letter more critically and comparing paſſages, the charge of <hi>hypocriſy</hi> and <hi>deceit</hi> appeared to me more glaring and groſs than ever.

In a word, that I was a deſigning finiſhed hypocrite, endeavouring, Lawyer like, to gain that by craft, which I knew I could not by <hi>ſcriptural argumentation</hi> and <hi>ſound reaſoning;</hi> but that after all I was fruſtrated in my evident deſign. And in addition to this, I note, that while (in your Poſtſcript) you are expreſſing ſome <hi>little charity</hi> to the miſled <hi>Brethren of my way,</hi> as you term it, you expreſs none for me; having before given me up as a ſoul-deſtroying <hi>Arminian</hi> and a <hi>deceiver,</hi> unfit ever to preach any more. Mr. <hi>Robbins,</hi> what groſs uncharitableneſs is here? What aſſuming the prerogative of the Almighty? The rankeſt <hi>Separate</hi> never exceeded you in cenſoriouſneſs. It is ſtrange that my <hi>earneſtneſs</hi> in urging what I verily thought to be an <hi>immortal truth</hi> of CHRIST ſhould have ſuch a <hi>baſe</hi> conſtruction put upon it by a profeſſor of godlineſs. I might with as much propriety apply theſe epithets to your fiery headſtrong zeal and management. But I have not ſo learned CHRIST.</p>
                     <p>I alſo remark, your <hi>amazing confidence</hi> as if <hi>infallibly</hi> certain you had truth on your ſide.

            <p>On theſe Letters I remark,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. That it was the firſt of theſe Letters that began our perſonal difference: Before this, we held a good co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, notwithſtanding our different ſentiments about bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; and might have done ſo ſtill, if he had managed the controverſy with argument inſtead of abuſe; And whether I gave him ſuficient ground for turning the diſpute into this channel by the preceeding Eſſay, I leave to the Reader's conſideration.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. What could be Mr. <hi>Robbins</hi>'s real motive in writing his firſt Letter? His excuſe is, that he had not time to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer my Piece at the church-meeting, it grew ſo late, which rendered it neceſſary for him to write. If this was the caſe, why did he not argue the point like a man, and endeavour to
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:012367_0056_0F89257521A5DC70"/>refute me, and not write like a <hi>Momus?</hi> Or did he think it too great a condeſcenſion for one in "<hi>a ſtation</hi> ſo far <hi>above me,</hi>" for one of his ſuperior penetration and ſagacity to deign to argue the point with ſuch a mean Antagoniſt? Why, in this caſe, a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ens contempt would have been the moſt proper an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. Or did he write <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>nt his indignation? He tells us, "he wrote not in a paſſion." Or did he do it purpoſely to pick a quarrel with me? This ſurely could not be the caſe with a man of Mr. <hi>Robbin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi>'s conſummate meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a grace that he has ſo much recommended of late; or was it done to chaſtize me for my preſumption in daring to oppoſe a men of his conſequence? This, I dare ſay, he will not own. Or did he write to terrify me from any further op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition? He ſays, in his Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

The real motive of this conduct is beyond my pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration: It fills me with ſurprize every time I think of it. As to the ſecond Letter, the deſign of it is not ſo myſterions; it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>tly to let me know the ſuparlative contempt he had for me. There is certainly nothing in either Letter that tends to adminiſter con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iction, if I had been ever ſo wrong; nothing but a torrent of abuſe, a rumbling ſound of hard words; an overflow of gall and bitterneſs. If I had wrote ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h Letters to Mr. <hi>Robbins,</hi> I ſhould have been afraid to walk the ſtreets. This leads me to aſk,</p>
            <p n="3">3d. Which has written with the greateſt aſperity? Mr. <hi>Robbins</hi> ſays, <hi>"I have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ronged him in my Letter thirty times is more than he has me in both his."</hi> Here it muſt be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, that he began the quarrel, and if, by his reflections and abuſes, I have been provoked to ſpeak ſometimes too harſhly. he may thank himſelf for it, by giving ſuch needleſs provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But how do the reflections on each ſide appear upon the compariſon? Why, if what he ſays of me be true, I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a <hi>grand knave,</hi> and a <hi>dangerous beretick,</hi> wholly unfit to <hi>inſtruct</hi> or preach any more. But in what light have I repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him? Why, the whole amounts to no more than this, that he has partly forgot his ſchool logic; that he is no great Divine; that he is not ſo much converſant in hiſtory as ſome ſcholars are; that he does not <hi>viſit</hi> his people enough to know
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:012367_0057_0F892575CBEEF650"/>who are the <hi>moſt</hi> experienced Chriſtians; that there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny points of divinity that he has neyer fully and particularly handled; that he hath ſpoke ſlightingly of <hi>relations,</hi> not of <hi>experiences,</hi> as he is pleaſed to turn it, which I never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed him of; that his diſcourſe was a <hi>rhapſady, &amp;c.</hi> If theſe things be <hi>true,</hi> where is the fault of telling him of them in the <hi>manner</hi> I have brought them in? which I deſire may be noticed. If any of the particulars be magnified beyond bounds, or the expreſſions too ſtrong, is the injury done him a thouſandth part ſo great as the injury to me? The differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I apprehend, is as great, as between the ſcratch of a pin and a ſtab through the vitals. Surely, if any one, that was an utter ſtranger to us both, ſhould read his Letters, and know no more of me than what is contained in them, he would think me a vile wretch indeed. And if they do me no hurt where I am known, no thanks to him.</p>
            <p n="4">4th. What ſatisfaction is proper in this caſe; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſatisfaction offered be ſufficient? As Mr. <hi>Robbins</hi> has brought <hi>particular</hi> charges againſt me, I think the ſatisfaction ought to be particular, and that a general acknowledgment, or amneſty, is not ſufficient to anſwer the goſpel rule, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But what ſatisfaction has been offered? Mr. <hi>Robbins</hi> offered this in <hi>general,</hi> upon our meeting with ſome Brethren, refuſing ſo much as to talk of <hi>particulars, viz.</hi> "You think I have injured you, and I think you have injured me thirty times more by your Letter: Let us make mutual conceſſions to each other; let us bury the hatchet, and forget and forgive, and for the future live in love and peace." Here is no acknowledgment either general or particular; but only a bare propoſal to let the matter drop, without ſaying any more about it; or in other words, to make ſomething of a ballance, and leave off on equal terms, with intimations at the ſame time, that he thought it a condeſcention in him to come down ſo <hi>low.</hi> This was the caſe; and yet I underſtand I am much blamed by many for not making up on theſe terms, and repreſented as <hi>unforgiving implacable,</hi> &amp;c. Even the pulpit has not been free from cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. If I had accepted this, it would have been an implicit conceſſion.
<list>
                  <item>1ſt. That I was wrong in ever manifeſting any diſſatisfaction at all.</item>
                  <item>2d. That the charges againſt me were well grounded and juſt.</item>
                  <item>3d. That I acquieſced in the doom he had pronounced upon me, as unfit to <hi>inſtruct,</hi> &amp;c. And</item>
                  <item>4th.
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:012367_0058_0F892576CD32D478"/>That I had really wronged him, and that in the degree he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, or at leaſt in equal degrees, when I was not conſcious I had wronged him at all. In ſhort, the terms offered appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me a further inſult, rather than any thing that looked like acknowledgment. If he thought proper to inſiſt upon a general making up, what leſs could he have ſaid, than that his Letters were <hi>raſh, haſty,</hi> and <hi>unguarded,</hi> and that he was <hi>ſorry</hi> that ever he wrote them? Or ſomething of the like tenor; but not ſo much as this, could be obtained.</item>

            <head>THE FOURTH AND LAST ESSAY.</head>
            <p>QUEST. WHETHER the practice of this church reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſubjects of Baptiſm be warrantable?</p>
            <p>The Affirmative further urged; <hi>June</hi> 30, 1772.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſhall endeavour to remove ſome of the mountains that have been laid in the way, or in other words, to ſolve ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties that have been newly alledged againſt this practice.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. It is ſaid, that the baptiſm of children, and of adult per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons is of quite a different nature; perſons baptized when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult are indeed compleat members, and have a right to all church privileges by virtue of their baptiſm; but it is not ſo with reſpect to baptized infants; their relation to the church at firſt is but incompleat and partial, and meerly mediate; all the end and intent of it, is <hi>to lay them under bonds to be the</hi> LORD'S when they grow up; but they are not entitled to the leaſt privilege by virtue of their baptiſm; and when they come to years of underſtanding, their relation to the church, or this incompleat memberſhip, if it may be ſo called, wholly ceaſes, let them be ever ſo ſerious and regular in their lives, unleſs they make it their own act by taking the covenant perſonally upon themſelves in a <hi>gracious manner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This poſition I look upon as abſurd and irrational and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to ſcripture. That childrens memberſhip is of the ſame nature, as full and compleat and as laſting as that of perſons baptized at adult age, and that they can forfeit it no other way but by bad principles or vicious lives, may be proved by the following arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. From the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>baptiſm,</hi> which is, according to all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, the door of entrance into the church. And if it is the door of entrance, then certainly all baptized perſons, whether admitted in infancy, or adult age are members, and there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be any ſpecific difference between the member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the one and the other. The ſcripture no where aſſigns any ſuch difference; and ſhall we be wiſer than GOD? The following ſcriptures may further illuſtrate this point. As 1ſt. The Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 25. <hi>As many as have been baptized
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:012367_0060_0F89257814234600"/>into</hi> CHRIST, <hi>have put on</hi> CHRIST; that is, have put on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his religion; they are become members of his church; they are in viſible covenant delation to him: Let them be child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren or grown perſons, their ſtanding in the church is the ſame. This place ſeems exactly parallel with that, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 13. <hi>We are all baptized into one body; we are all,</hi> whether infants or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult, received into the boſom of the church; we are equally become parts of this <hi>body,</hi> which is but <hi>one.</hi>

            <p>Again, the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Eph.</hi> iv. 5. There is but <hi>one</hi> LORD, <hi>one ſaith, one baptiſm.</hi> But according to this new notion, there are <hi>two baptiſms</hi> ſpecifically diſtinct; the one only lays perſons under <hi>bonds,</hi> but the other entitles them to all privileges; which is certainly abſurd. This new doctrine, if true, would inſet the neceſſity of rebaptization. Accordingly, Dr. <hi>Inc. Mather</hi> obſerves, that rebaptization is the neceſſary conſequence of it: <q>For it ſeems, ſays he, according to this plan the covenant which the child was in when an infant is become a <hi>meer nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;</hi> ſo that now being adult, he muſt not renew his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant but enter into a new and other kind of covenant, which he was never i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> before: Now it is neceſſary, that when a man doth enter into covenant, he ſhould be initiated by baptiſm. There was lately a ſot in the world, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> tells us, who upon this very ground, although they did acknowledge baptiſm of infants as lawful, yet did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptize themſelves when adult.</q> Thus Dr. <hi>Mather;</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of baptiſm, p. 65.</p>
            <p n="2">2d.

               </gap> viſible memberſhip to be equal to that of their parents: They are both alike intereſted in the promiſe, ſo far as to have a ſtanding in GOD'S church. And we read <hi>Gen.</hi> xvii. 13. That the <hi>covenant of circumciſion</hi> was given for <hi>an everlaſting covenant;</hi> ſo that children do not grow out of it by their becoming adult.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. We may argue the point from the claims of this cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant relation as ſtill ſubſiſting, made by ſeveral particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons after they arrived at adult age. How frequent is this plea in the Old Teſtament, <hi>thou art the</hi> GOD <hi>of my Fathers?</hi> Import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their preſent covenant relation to GOD through their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents means; otherwiſe there would be no force in the plea: For what benefit would it be if he were <hi>only</hi> the <hi>Father's</hi> GOD, and not the childrens too, by virtue of the covenant? <hi>David</hi> pleads, <hi>Pſal.</hi> cxvi. 16. <hi>I am thy Servant the ſon of thy Hand-maid.</hi> He was far from thinking that his <hi>covenant</hi> relation to GOD by virtue of his circumciſion ceaſed, when he became capable of acting for himſelf; he ſtill holds it to be in is full force as ever; <hi>I am the Son of thy Hand-maid.</hi> I was early given to GOD in circumciſion; that relation or memberſhip ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues; and upon this ground I beg for covenant bleſſings. Diſtreſſed <hi>Ephraim</hi> uſes the ſame plea; <hi>Jer.</hi> xxxi. 18. <hi>Turn thou me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for thou art the</hi> LORD <hi>my</hi> GOD. He does not call GOD <hi>his</hi> GOD, becauſe he thought he had a ſpecial ſaving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in GOD at this time; for he verily thought himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted; but pleads his covenant relation to GOD by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of circumciſion, as an argument for ſpecial grace which ſhews that that relation ſtill ſubſiſted when he was grown up. The pious Mr. <hi>Vincent,</hi> in his Treatiſe of Converſion, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets the text thus. Says he, <q>Under the Old Teſtament every <hi>Iſraelite</hi> that in <hi>infaa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="58" facs="unknown:012367_0062_0F892579A593E750"/>LORD, his GOD, when he cries to him to be turned, <hi>Jer.</hi> xxxi. 18. <hi>Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned; for thou art the</hi> LORD <hi>my</hi> GOD: As if he ſhould ſay, LORD! <hi>I have been circumciſed and dedicated unto thee, and laid under an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to be thine: Ob circumciſe and turn my heart, that I may be</hi> thine <hi>indeed.</hi> Do the children of believers under the goſpel want ſuch an help to converſion as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren under the law had? Did CHRIST come to turn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants out of covenant, who were once taken in; and to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the ſaints privileges, inſtead of enlarging and augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them? No, no; he that hath been baptized and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this ſeal of the New Teſtament, may with confidence addreſs unto GOD, and ſay; LORD! <hi>I have been baptized with water; Ob ſprinkle me with the blood of</hi> JESUS; <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize me with his Spirit; waſh me thoroughly from my iniquity; cleanſe and turn my heart to thee, and make me faithful and fled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in thy covenant.</hi>
               </q> Thus Mr. <hi>Vincent,</hi> p. 79. And the great Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> formerly of <hi>Hatfield,</hi> interprets this text in <hi>Jer.</hi> in the ſame manner in his Sermon on Infant Baptiſm, p. 19, 25. And I believe it is the ſenſe that Divines generally put upon it.<note n="*" place="bottom">The reaſon why I enlarge on this text is, that it being mentioned by me in my <hi>firſt Piece,</hi> the ſenſe I put on it was denied, which rendered ſuch enlargement neceſſary. It is omitted <hi>there,</hi> to avoid needleſs repetitions. I would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve further here, how incongruous the new ſenſe put on the text is; according to that it muſt run thus, <hi>Turn thou me, for I am turned already; give me faith, for I am now in the exerciſe of faith; become my</hi> GOD, <hi>for thou art my</hi> GOD <hi>at this preſent.</hi> Which conſtruction let him receive who will.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4th. We may argue this point from many other divine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations. <hi>The kingdom of</hi> GOD <hi>ſhall be token from you,</hi> ſays CHRIST, <hi>and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</hi> Matt. xxi. 43. That is, they ſhould be deprived of their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant relation to GOD by virtue of circumciſion; they ſhould be cut off from their memberſhip in the viſible church, which is here called <hi>the kingdom of</hi> GOD, and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould be admitted in their flead. To the ſame purpoſe is <hi>Rom.</hi> xi. The Apoſtle there declares at large how the <hi>Jews</hi> were <hi>broken off.</hi> That is, unchurched, and the <hi>Gentiles graſſed</hi> in their room, <hi>to partake of the root and fatneſs of the olive-tree.</hi> Their viſible relation to GOD by means of circumciſion was at an
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:012367_0063_0F89257A53D63F40"/>end. And innumerable declarations of the like nature are to be found in the Old Teſtament. That text is remarkable, <hi>Jer.</hi> iii. 14. <hi>Turn, O backſliding children, ſaith the</hi> LORD; <hi>for I am married to you.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">We were in effect told the Sabbath after this Piece was delivered even in publick Prayer, and ſince that in a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that this text was addreſſed to backſliding believers: But this could not be; the addreſs was made to the whole people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and they were almoſt univerſally corrupt at this time: Read not only the context, but <hi>Jer.</hi> V. 1. and ix. 2 and indeed the whole prophecy.</note> That this is ſpoken of <hi>unregenerates</hi> is abundantly evident from the context; and yet GOD calls them <hi>children;</hi> that is, children of the covenant, within the pale of the church; and the expreſſion, <hi>I am married to you,</hi> is ſtill more ſtrong: He does not ſay, <hi>I will be married to you if you turn;</hi> but, <hi>I am married to you;</hi> to denote their preſent cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant relation to GOD. They had not loſt their member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip received in circumciſion, notwithſtanding their vile de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacies; and this he urges as one of the ſtrongeſt motives to repentance and converſion. GOD was willing to receive them, notwithſtanding their repeated adulteries and breaches of wedlock; <hi>though ye have played the harlot with many lovers, yet return unto me, ſaith the</hi> LORD, ver. 1. Again, how often does GOD call the <hi>Iſraelites his people,</hi> from one generation to another, even in the time of the greateſt degeneracy; and this upon account of their viſible covenant relation to him, or being members of his church by virtue of circumciſion. And this relation continued until GOD gave them <hi>a bill of divorce</hi> at the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> and <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> captivities, when he pronounced <hi>lo-ammi</hi> upon them. That is, <hi>they ſhould be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger his people nor be their</hi> GOD. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> i. 9, and <hi>Jer.</hi> iii. 8. And the ſame doom was pronounced upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſometime after CHRIST'S death, by the Apoſtles, when they were wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churched and deprived of their viſible covenant relation or memberſhip. <hi>Rom.</hi> xi. and elſewhere. All this ſerves to ſhew, that memberſhip received in infancy by circumciſion or bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm never ceaſes but continues in adult age, until a people or particular perſon be regularly cut off or caſt out by ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate act of GOD, or by the act of the church in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of diſcipline.</p>
            <p>We may alſo prove, that infant-memberſhip continues after they arrived to ſuch years, as to be capable of miniſterial teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, conſequently of perſonal covenanting, from <hi>John</hi> xxi. 15.
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:012367_0064_0F89257B14ED6818"/>
               <hi>Feed my lambs,</hi> ſays CHRIST to <hi>Peter.</hi> They who are given to me in circumciſion or baptiſm, are <hi>my lambs;</hi> they have my mark upon them; I own them ſtill as part of my <hi>flock;</hi> they have not loſt their memberſhip, now they begin to be capable of acting for themſelves: Therefore <hi>feed</hi> them as belonging to my fold; <hi>feed</hi> them as well as the more adult <hi>ſheep;</hi> they are all equally members. And <hi>Peter</hi> tells the numerous congregation to which he preached, <hi>Act.</hi> iii. 25. <hi>Ye are the children of the covenant, which</hi> GOD <hi>made with our Fathers.</hi> He here plainly ſuppoſes their covenant relation received in infancy, ſtill to remain; and urges it as a motive to repentance. And we may obſerve, that the terms <hi>circumciſed</hi> and <hi>uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed</hi> are uſed through all the Old Teſtament, to diſtinguiſh thoſe who are of the viſible church and who not; which plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denotes, that infants memberſhip ever remains in adult age, unleſs perſons are regularly cut off for their wickedneſs by ſon e judicial act of GOD or the church; in which caſe their <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion</hi> becomes <hi>uncircumciſion,</hi> that is, they ceaſe to be members. Hence the city of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is called the <hi>holy city,</hi> at the time of CHRIST'S death, upon the account of this federal holineſs, or their being in covenant with GOD by circumciſion, when there was ſcarce a <hi>real</hi> holy perſon in it. <hi>Matt.</hi> xxvii. 53.</p>
            <p n="5">5th. This doctrine is attended with great inconveniencies, and ſeveral groſs conſequences reſult from it, which are not to be admitted. 1ſt. It puts baptized and unbaptized perſons all upon a par or level: They ſeem to be exactly in the ſame ſituation, if the former are grown out of the church, and all relation ceaſes at adult age; we may well then object as thoſe did of old; <hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 1. <hi>What advantage then hath the Jew? Or what profit is there of circumciſion?</hi> The anſwer according to this ſcheme muſt be, <hi>the advantage or profit is none at all:</hi> But the Apoſtle was of another mind; he anſwers <hi>Rom.</hi> v. ii. <hi>The profit is much every way. For to them pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law and the ſervice of</hi> GOD, <hi>and the promiſes,</hi> ſays he in another place <hi>Rom.</hi> ix. 4. And indeed it has been always eſteemed a great privilege by the people of GOD for themſelves and theirs to be under the covenant. And Mr. <hi>Robbins</hi> himſelf calls the baptiſm of infants <hi>an ineſtimable privilege;</hi> which cannot be true, if they are entitled to no privilege at all by virtue of their baptiſm. This leads me to obſerve, 2d. This doctrine tends to ſadden the hearts of godly parents. It is a comfortable conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to them, whether living or dying, that their children or rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:012367_0065_0F89257BD7BCC840"/>are under the wing of the covenant, although not as yet converted; they hope covenant mercy will reach them in due time; they look upon this as a weighty plea with GOD in prayer, and accordingly uſe it; as <hi>David</hi> did for his ſon <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon.</hi> 1. Chron. xxix. 19.<note n="*" place="bottom">The pious Mr. <hi>David Jennings,</hi> in his Sermon on this text, ſays, <q>
                     <hi>David</hi>'s argument here is, <hi>give unto Solomon,</hi> MY SON. His being <hi>David</hi>'s Son was not only the reaſon that <hi>David</hi> was ſo much concerned for him, and ſo deſirous that GOD would bleſs him, and make him good; but I conceive that he mentions it as an argument which he pleads with GOD in behalf of <hi>Solomon: He is my Son.</hi> As <hi>David</hi> had laid hold of GOD'S covenant for himſelf; ſo here he pleads it for his <hi>Son</hi> too. <hi>Solomon</hi> had been conſecrated to GOD in the ordinance of circumciſion; thereby he was received to the viſible church, and GOD'S mark was ſet upon him. This might very well afford <hi>David</hi> an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging argument to plead in prayer, LORD, I have given up this my Son unto thee; I have done it by thine own appointment and command; I have ſolemnly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated him to thy ſervice; behold thy mark is upon him! LORD, caſt him not off utterly, own him for thy Son, and make him thine forever. LORD, <hi>give him a perfect heart.</hi>
                  </q>
               </note> And all their hopes of good for their unregenerate offspring, when they lye a dying, is bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon this foundation. <q>As a precious man, when dying, called his children about him ſaid, children, <hi>I have nothing to leave you, but a</hi> GOD, <hi>and a gracious covenant, and that is enough for you:</hi>
               </q> And ſhall we daſh all theſe hopes and pleas at once by telling them, that their children <hi>have no part in the</hi> LORD; that they have no more right to his covenant, than the worſt <hi>Indian</hi> or <hi>Heathen</hi> in the land, who are within the ſound of the goſpel? GOD forbid. 3d. This doctrine in effect condemns the practice of GOD'S people in their prayers for reformation. How frequent is this plea in ſcripture, and that in the worſt times of degeneracy, LORD, <hi>we are thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; we are called by thy name,</hi> &amp;c. The meaning is, we are thy people in viſible covenant; we were devoted to thee in circumciſion; this relation ſtill continues at adult age; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore give this people the grace of the covenant. But how vain and futile does this place appear to be, if infant memberſhip be wholly loſt, when perſons become capable of acting for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or of <hi>perſonal</hi> covenanting. 4th. This doctrine in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect makes infant baptiſm a meer nullity; or at moſt a mean,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:012367_0066_0F89257C9B3028C8"/>little inſignificant rite, which may near as well be let a lone, as done. Agreeable whereto it was ſaid at laſt church-meeting, <hi>What ſignifies it to have an infant ſprinkled with a little water?</hi> An expeſſion that made me ſhudder.</p>
            <p>My Brethern, I beg to know what infants are baptized for, if they are not made members of GOD'S church? To what end is this ordinance? Of what benefit and advantage? And are not the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> right in laying it aſide? If you ſay, it is to lay them under <hi>ſtronger bands</hi> to be the LORD'S when they grow up. Pray, what ſcripture have you to prove, that this is the <hi>only end</hi> of baptiſm? If the greater arguments from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of GOD'S being our Creator, Preſerver, Governor, and Redeemer, will not prevail, how little can be expected from this? I muſt profeſs, that, if I thought theſe <hi>bonds</hi> were all that was imported in infant's baptiſm, and that there was no conſideration to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e had of the <hi>privileges</hi> accompanying the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and of the expectation we may rationally have of GOD'S bleſſing attending his own inſtitution, I ſhould not think thoſe much to blame who wholly rejected infant baptiſm.

            <p>I conclude this head with a quotation or two: The pious Preſident <hi>Wadſworth,</hi> after explaining ſome ſcriptures, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes thus; theſe things plainly ſhew, that children of the <q>covenant do not ceaſe to be in GOD'S covenant <hi>meerly by their growing up from an infant to an adult ſtate;</hi> as ſome are apt to imagine.

            <p>But it would be endleſs to cite human teſtimonies, ſince this has been the univerſally received opinion of Miniſters and churches from CHRIST'S time to this day; except Mr. <hi>Daven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> Mr. <hi>Street,</hi> and two or three others in the time of the <hi>Synod,</hi> and a few <hi>Connecticut</hi> Miniſters, &amp;c. in our days; who are forced to advance the contrary abſurd doctrine, in order to uphold their oppoſition to the practice recommended by the <hi>Synod.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the whole, as Mr. <hi>Robbins</hi> expreſſly granted at the laſt church-meeting, that, according to our Catechiſm, <hi>the infants of ſuch as are members of the viſible church are to be baptized;</hi> and, as I have fully proved that baptized perſons are members of the viſible church, it undeniably follows, that their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are to be baptized; and none can lawfully deny them this privilege, unleſs they have forfeited it by their wickedneſs.
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:012367_0068_0F89257E1B97DBA8"/>What an amazing thing then is it, that any are ſo fond of principles, urging them with ſo much heat and vehemence, that tend ſo directly to unchurch their poſterity, and leave them in the ſtate of outcaſts and aliens to GOD'S covenant?</p>
            <p>If what has been ſaid, does not ſatisfy, I deſire that Dr. <hi>Inor. Mather</hi>'s twelve arguments in proof of the point may be read, as alſo the arguments of the <hi>Synod;</hi> with which what I have alledged does but little interfere; ſo fruitful is the ſcripture of arguments, to prove children's memberſhip and its continuance at adult age.</p>
            <p n="2">II.

1ſt. I think the controverſy is greatly miſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſtated. By Mr. <hi>Robbins</hi>'s management and arguments, one would think that the diſpute here is the ſame that ſubſiſted at <hi>North-Hampton</hi> ſome years ago between Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> and his people. But this is not the caſe; for Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> meddles little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with <hi>baptiſm,</hi> but the LORD'S <hi>ſupper;</hi> and all his diſcourſe is about qualifications for that, which I never yet pretended to diſclaim; neither did it ever enter into my heart, that the chief deſign of our church-meetings was to determine, whethes Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi>'s doctrine about the LORD'S ſupper was right or not. The diſpute here relates entirely to the initiating or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of <hi>baptiſm.</hi> And even as to this, the controverſy is not; whether they ſhould be <hi>viſible Chriſtians</hi> that offer themſelves or not; we agree that they ſhould be ſuch. In what then do we differ? Why, 1ſt. our opponents ſay, that the <hi>higheſt</hi> ſort of evidence of grace is neceſſary in this caſe; we ſay the <hi>loweſt</hi> is ſufficient, eſpecially with reſpect to perſons already baptized, as baptiſm is a facrament of entrance.</p>
            <p>But what is this <hi>higheſt ſort</hi> of evidence that they inſiſt on? Why, this is a myſtery that I could never yet unfold. Is it a particular relation of experiences? No; this, they ſay, is not abſolutely neceſſary; this is not the ſtandard that the ſcripture gives for the church to judge by. What then is it? Why, <hi>profeſſion and practice,</hi> or the life and converſation. To this we again agree: In what then do we differ but in words? But if Mr. <hi>Robbins</hi> now ſays, contrary to all his former declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that a relation is abſolutely neceſſary, how can he look upon thoſe, who have already owned the covenant as members in full communion, as he ſays he does, that never made any ſuch relation? What an inconſiſtency would be here? 2d. They ſay, that none ſhould come to baptiſm, but they ſhould immediately come likewiſe to the LORD'S ſupper. But we ſay, they may come to the one ordinance and not to the other in ſome caſes; that baptized perſons, of regular converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, have right to come, and none have right to deny them: Here then the diſpute chiefly lies, and not ſo much about <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications.</hi> Why then do we hear ſo much concerning them, as if the hinge of the controverſy lay here? If Mr. <hi>Robbins</hi> would only receive thoſe whom he calls <hi>qualified,</hi> to own the covenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he would meet with little oppoſition. But it ſeems they muſt be excluded without they will come im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to full communion, let their ſcruples be what they will, which is what I think he cannot anſwer to GOD or the church. Wherefore I deſire to hear no more about qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:012367_0070_0F892581E562EC40"/>about <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>gracious ſincerity,</hi> which are terms I never uſed, until this point be ſettled.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. I obſerve, that it is peculiar to thoſe of the <hi>congregational way</hi> to have a church, as it were, within a church; to make diſtinction between members at large, and members <hi>in particular,</hi> between communicants and others. All other perſuaſions rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon bapt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>zed perſons ſuch members, as to be entitled to all church privileges whenever they demand them, if they lay no bar in the way by their wickedneſs: Which is the reaſon why we read of no diſputes in ſuch churches about the ſubjects of baptiſm, ſuch as ſubſiſt among the <hi>congregationiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3d. I obſerve, our Brethren of the other ſide of the queſtion, are exactly like thoſe <hi>Diſciples,</hi> who becauſe the <hi>Jews,</hi> we read of in ſcripture, did not follow CHRIST ſo <hi>fully</hi> and in the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> they expected and required, <hi>forbad them to bring their child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren to</hi> CHRIST. But CHRIST ſays, <hi>ſorbid them not, for of ſuch is the kingdom,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">4th. I obſerve, that if a perſon baptized ſays, <hi>that as far as he knows his own heart, he is ſincerely willing to give up himſelf and his children to</hi> GOD, that is enough. The Miniſter ſhould go no further. He has no buſineſs to puzzle and confound him with a long diſcourſe about <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>gracious ſincerity,</hi> which it is likely the candidate will underſtand little of.</p>
            <p n="5">5th. I obſerve, that if a man offers himſelf to either ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, only to <hi>be ſeen of men,</hi> &amp;c. and knows it, nothing that can be ſaid to him about <hi>grace</hi> will hinder him: He will come, let the Miniſter ſay what he will. But it is only the <hi>tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcienced,</hi> that have been under <hi>ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>k of the Spirit,</hi> that will be ſcared and terrified away by the preſent harſh method of treating the ſubjects. So here is the utmoſt danger, as I have obſerved heretofore, <hi>of breaking the bruiſed read, and quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſmoaking flax,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="6">6th. I obſerve it as a certain maxim of truth, that if a man declares upon oath more than he knows, he is guilty of <hi>perjury,</hi> though it ſhould happen afterwards to be true. If a man then publickly profeſſes, that GOD <hi>is his</hi> GOD, and that he has <hi>ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith,</hi> and does not know it to be ſo, though it ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear afterwards to be the caſe, he certainly goes beyond the line of truth; he ſolemnly, and, as it were, upon oath declares that to be true, which he does not know but may be falſe; which is the very eſſence of a lye. Conſequently there can be no covenanting with GOD upon this new ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>me, without a <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge</hi> of a ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'s gracious ſtate. And in addition to
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:012367_0071_0F8925845ED710B8"/>this I obſerve, that Mr. <hi>Robbins,</hi> according to his plan, muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily tell every candidate that offers, that it is <hi>ſaving faith</hi> he <hi>prefeſſes,</hi> when the covenant is propounded to him; and he muſt neceſſarily tell him further, that if he <hi>has not</hi> ſaving faith, he <hi>cannot profeſs it.</hi> How then can ſuch a candidate proceed one ſtep further, without he <hi>knows</hi> he has ſaving faith? Or further, where is the conſiſtency to tell a man that it is enough for him to ſay that he <hi>hopes</hi> he has ſaving faith, when diſcourſed with in private; if, when he comes into publick, he muſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely profeſs ſaving faith, without any <hi>hope ſo</hi> in the caſe? How can theſe things hang together? But what are theſe <hi>prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hopes.</hi> founded on ſcripture evidence, ſo much talked of? Are they not in effect the ſame with aſſurance? Prevailing hopes may be accompanied with <hi>doubes</hi> and <hi>fears;</hi> and ſo may <hi>aſſurance: Full aſſurance</hi> I know excludes all doubts, but not ſo the other; there are <hi>degrees</hi> of aſſurance. So that I do not ſee why they need ſtart ſo much at the word <hi>aſſurance,</hi> when they hold the ſame thing in other words. Mr. <hi>Bellamy</hi> uſes the word, <hi>knowledge</hi> or <hi>knowing</hi> in this caſe, which is certainly as ſtrong a term as aſſurance.</p>
            <p n="7">7th I obſerve, that the word <hi>ſoul</hi> is much uſed in this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy; and indeed it ſeems that almoſt all the arguments uſed on the other ſide of the queſtion are founded on this word: People are ſo continually dinned and drowned with it, that they imagine there is more in it than there is. Therefore I ſhall add a little on this point. There is no <hi>goſpel ordinance</hi> whatſoever but carries the <hi>nature,</hi> the very <hi>eſſence</hi> of a <hi>ſeal. Prayer</hi> is a ſeal of the covenant of grace. When we ſay, <hi>our Father which art in Heaven</hi> in ſincerity, we ſet to our ſeal that GOD is <hi>our Father.</hi> Hearing is a ſeal; when we heartily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the truths delivered, <hi>we ſet to our ſeal that</hi> GOD <hi>is true. John</hi> iii. 33. <hi>Reading the word</hi> is a ſeal; when we apply the law or goſpel to our ſouls, we ſeal the truth of it. Muſt then all unregenerate men be debarred from theſe ordinances, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe, <hi>properly uſed,</hi> are ſeals, always ſeals, of the covenant of grace? No, ſay they, theſe <hi>are moral duties,</hi> and therefore ought to be performed by all; but baptiſm and the LORD'S ſupper are <hi>poſitive ſpecial inſtitutions,</hi> and are only to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by true believers. Here then the argument from the <hi>nature of a ſeal</hi> is given up: It is in effect granted, that unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate men may partake of <hi>ſome</hi> of the ſeals of the covenant of grace, though not of <hi>others;</hi> and the reaſon why they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:012367_0072_0F892585ECD39DD0"/>from the one and not from the other, is not taken from the <hi>nature of a ſeal,</hi> but from a <hi>different ground, viz.</hi> the one's being of a <hi>moral</hi> and the other of <hi>poſitive</hi> inſtitution. How ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd then is this way of reaſoning taken meerly from the <hi>nature</hi> of a <hi>ſeal?</hi> But to follow then the argument a lit le further. The argument from the nature of a ſeal being given up, and another foundation eſtabliſhed in its room, let us ſee how far this will hold. The ſacraments, ſay they, are <hi>poſitive ſpecial</hi> inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and therefore confined to believers. But does not this prove too much? May not the ſame be ſaid of all the <hi>ſacrifices</hi> under the law, as well as of the paſſover, baptiſm, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> They were not of a <hi>moral</hi> nature, but of <hi>poſitive ſpecial</hi> inſtitution. Muſt not then an unregenerate <hi>Jew</hi> engage in the <hi>daily ſacrifice,</hi> or the ſacrifices offered every Sabbath, becauſe of poſitive inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Why, this would have deſtroyed all publick worſhip at once among the <hi>Jews.</hi> If none but <hi>regenerates</hi> muſt have come to the <hi>temple,</hi> (which were ſo few generally) what thin aſſemblies would they have had. It follows then that as ordinances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meerly of <hi>poſitive ſpecial inſtitution,</hi> is not in it ſelf a ſufficient bar to <hi>unregenerates</hi> attending <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on them. So that both their grounds here fail them. But what does all this arguing tend to, will they ſay, but to encourage unregenerate men, knowing themſelves to be ſuch, to come to both ſacraments? I anſwer, this is not my deſign in it, but only to ſhew the <hi>weakneſs</hi> of the argument taken from the <hi>nature</hi> of a <hi>ſeal, &amp;c.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">There are ſome <hi>other conſiderations</hi> which render it not proper, that baptiſm and the LORD'S ſupper ſhould be made as <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> as the other ordinances; but the argument for their reſtrictive uſe, taken meerly from the rature of a ſeal, proves nothing either one way or the other.</note> But thus much I ſay, if a perſon under ferious religious impreſſions ſhould out of a ſenſe of duty come to either ordinance, he ſins <hi>leſs</hi> in <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> than in <hi>ſtaying away,</hi> though it ſhould afterwards appear that he was unregenerate at the time. This leads me,</p>
            <p n="8">8th. To take notice of ſome abſurd doctrines delivered by the chief promoter of the new ſcheme. Theſe are Mr. <hi>Bellamy</hi>'s words <q>When a natural man owns the covenant, or pretends to own it, for it is impoſſible for ſuch a man to own the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace really, he ſins againſt GOD in a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking manner than if he had committed <hi>drunkenneſs, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,</hi> and <hi>adultery;</hi>
               </q> p. 48. And the reaſon he gives is,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:012367_0073_0F8925864DC69898"/>becauſe ſuch are guilty of <hi>lying to</hi> GOD <hi>and perjury:</hi> This, we may obſerve, is ſpoken not only of <hi>wilful hypocrites,</hi> who do all to be ſeen of men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but of all unregenerate men whatſoever let them be under ever ſo great religious impreſſions, ever ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious or conſciencious in what they do. This I ſtick not to call <hi>horrible doctrine,</hi> contrary to ſcripture and r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aſon. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this, 1ſt. <hi>Ahab</hi> ſinned more in <hi>humbling himſelf</hi> and <hi>walking ſoftly,</hi> which neceſſarily implies his <hi>confeſſing his ſin</hi> and <hi>promiſing</hi> reformation; I ſay, that he ſinned more in doing this than in murdering <hi>Naboth</hi> and taking away his vineyard by injuſtice and violence. 2d. According to this doctrine, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Joſiah</hi> ſinned more in promoting, and the people in joining in <hi>renewing covenant,</hi> than they would have cone in murdering a whole city, or all turning <hi>drunkards</hi> and <hi>adulterers:</hi> For, it is evident by the peoples after apoſtacy, that their hearts were not generally right with GOD in the tranſaction. 3d. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this doctrine, the King and the people of <hi>Niacvah</hi> ſinned more provokingly in repenting and reforming <hi>in the manner they did,</hi> than they would have if they had murdered <hi>Jonah</hi> and bid defiance to the GOD of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> 4th. According to this doctrine, if a ſinner unconverted in a time of ſickneſs or other great diſtreſs, ſhould acknowledge his ſins and <hi>premiſe</hi> reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with all appearing earneſtneſs, he is all the while commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a greater ſin in <hi>promiſing,</hi> than drunkenneſs or adultery. What a figure, would a Miniſter make, if he ſhould ſtop the ſinner's month by telling him this? Is it not rather the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's duty to <hi>encourage</hi> him, though at the ſame time teiling him that he muſt go to CHRIST for ſtrength, otherwiſe all his reſolutions and <hi>premiſes</hi> will come to nothing?</p>
            <p>For my part, I always thought, and it is the opinion of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all Divines, that a particular perſons or a peoples perſorm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a duty with any ſort of ſincerity, was a <hi>leſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r</hi> ſin than a <hi>total neglect, &amp;c.</hi> And as to <hi>ſpecial ordinances,</hi> particularly, although I think they ought to be <hi>viſible Chriſtians</hi> that come; yet that if they do come coaſciencionſly, though unconcerted, their ſin is not ſo great and provoking, as a contemptuous turning their back upon the ordinance. The ſcriptures tell us, that he that was not circumciſed, or did not eat the paſſover, was to be <hi>out off from his people;</hi> that is, put to death: But no ſuch puniſhment was threatned to an untegenerate man that performed tue duty.</p>
            <p>But what ſignifies mens coming to ſpecial ordinances, if their hearts be not engaged in the duty? What is here but
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:012367_0074_0F8925889C91D7C0"/>
               <hi>meer form?</hi> And what can be more provoking than that? I anſwer, the <hi>form</hi> of religion compared with the <hi>power,</hi> is a <hi>little thing;</hi> but in itſelf it is a <hi>great thing:</hi> But where that remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, GOD hath graciouſly returned many and many a time to his people. But when both <hi>form</hi> and <hi>power</hi> were gone, there never was an inſtance of GOD'S remaining with that people, but they were made examples of vengeance.</p>
            <p n="9">9th. I obſerve, that we ſeem to be agreed in this, that none but <hi>viſible Chriſtians</hi> or <hi>believers</hi> ſhould be admitted to either ordinance. But when they come to explain themſelves, it is evident that by <hi>viſible Chriſtians</hi> they mean <hi>real Chriſtians;</hi> ſo confounding all diſtinction between the <hi>viſible</hi> and <hi>inviſible</hi> church, in direct contradiction to almoſt all Divines. And herein they talk juſt as the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> do, who deſtroy all differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the <hi>external</hi> and <hi>internal</hi> parts of the covenant.</p>
            <p n="10">10th. I obſerve, that Mr. <hi>Davenport,</hi> the great writer againſt the <hi>Synod,</hi> was conſiſtent with himſelf: He profeſſedly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that the church had nothing to do with the baptized im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately in a way of diſcipline, as not being <hi>immediate</hi> members. But our Paſtor called the church together at their firſt meeting, partly to <hi>diſcipline the baptized children of the church;</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, that he thought them to be <hi>immediate members:</hi> And this is a matter that yet lies under our conſideration underermined If he has ſince altered his mind he ought publickly to declare that he was then in an <hi>error,</hi> and that he did wrong in propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>diſcipline</hi> to the church, or our calling thoſe to account with whom we have nothing to do, according to his preſent princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. This would be <hi>ingenuous,</hi> and what the church have a right to expect, if he has led them in a wrong path, or propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed what ought not to be propoſed. <hi>For what have we to do to judge them that are without?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 12.</p>
            <p n="11">11th. I would obſerve, upon a paſſage that ſell from Mr. <hi>Robbins</hi> at laſt church-meeting.

They endeavour to inſtill into people, that the whole deſign of the <hi>oppoſition</hi> is to get Mr. <hi>Robbins</hi> away; hoping, if ſuch a notion be once imbibed, it will put then into ſuch a ferment, that they will join in aboliſhing the practice right or wrong, in order to keep Mr. <hi>Robbins.</hi> But how unjuſt is this? And what groſs uncharitableneſs does it involve in it? Pray, who was it firſt brought this diſpute into the church? Not we, ſure. Who is it that are for <hi>innovation?</hi> Not we: And muſt we <hi>ſubmit</hi> to innovations, for fear our Miniſter ſhould run away from us? Not we, unleſs our conſciences were convinced. If Mr. <hi>Robbins</hi> is reſolved to leave us, if he cannot gain his point, we cannot help it; we muſt do our duty, and leave the event to GOD. As for any <hi>direct deſign</hi> to get him away, it never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into my heart; and I never heard any thing liſped by my Brethren tending that way: All our deſign is, I can ſpeak it for myſelf, and believe it of my Brethren; I ſay, all our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is to diſcharge our conſciences and do our duty: We think the point of <hi>very great importance,</hi> and cannot give it up. And in order to promote peace, we have alrealy propoſed an <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient</hi> that would make all eaſy, and hurt no man's conſcience. But with what contempt was it rejected.<note n="*" place="bottom">As ſoon as I had finiſhed reading this Piece to the church; Mr. <hi>Robbins,</hi> inſtead of anſwering the argument, made a few general reflections a The ſubſtance was, <q>That I darkned counſel with words without knowledge; that I dreſſed him up in bearſkins; that the whole of my Piece was calculated to repreſent him in a ridiculous light; that he <hi>ſuſpected</hi> it before, but was now <hi>confirmed</hi> in it, that <hi>our whole deſign</hi> was to get him away.</q> Thus, in direct terms in the face of the church, giving me <hi>the lye</hi> after ſuch ſolemn aſſeverations.</note>

            <p>If we patiently ſubmit in this point, meerly to pleaſe or keep Mr. <hi>Robbins,</hi> who will ever dare to ſpeak againſt <hi>innovations</hi> again, let them come ever ſo faſt? We have had ſomething <hi>new</hi> ſtarted to trouble the churches peace, I think, every two or three years ſince his ſettlement; And who can aſſure us, that it will not be ſo hereafter, until the whole of the <hi>Canazdicut diſciplins</hi> be brought in upon us?<note n="†" place="bottom">Scare any are ignorant that the diſcipline in <hi>Connecticut</hi> ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges towards <hi>Preſyterianiſm;</hi> and it is natural for thoſe brought up under ſuch a conſtitution to be blaſſed in his favour; and therefore we may expect it will be thouſt in upon us, if we tamely ſubmit in other things.</note> If any make the leaſt, <hi>oppoſution,</hi> why

But I truſt the Brethren are better fortified than to be led away by ſuth inſinuations; and hope that <hi>whiſperers, talc bearers,</hi> and <hi>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>Upon the whole, I hope whatever the Brethren do in this matter will be founded upon <hi>full conviction of conſcience;</hi> I ſay, <hi>full conviction of conſcience;</hi> and that they will not be influenced one way or the other meerly to pleaſe any man whatſoever; and that they will not hold the doctrine of CHRIST with <hi>reſpect of perſons;</hi> but with all impartiality will paſs their judgment, as they will anſwer it at the bar of CHRIST.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude with ſome PROPOSALS. And my.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt propoſal is, inſtead of contending what privileges belong to the children of the church, we had better unite in granting them ſome <hi>privilege;</hi> and then ſet upon the vigorous exerciſe of <hi>diſcipline:</hi> And we may hope for GOD'S bleſſing in <hi>reforming,</hi> or at leaſt in <hi>reſtraining</hi> our licencious youth.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. I would propoſe this churches ſolemnly <hi>renewing covenant</hi> on a day of faſting and prayer, according to the model of our Fathers. This has been found a happy expedient of reviving religion in timer of great degeneracy; the divine bleſſing uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally accompanying it; as we ſee in the time of Kings <hi>Hezeki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nſe of covenant vows and enpagements, both in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants and the children of the church, and excites a more ſtrict and circumſpect walk.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. I would propoſe that the church, by a <hi>formal vote,</hi> adopt the method I propoſed the laſt town-meeting, <hi>viz.</hi> for a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Miniſter to baptize the children of the church, as long as Mr. <hi>Robbins</hi>'s ſcruples remain: By which it will appear, that we have no deſign of ſoreing Mr. <hi>Robbins</hi> to act againſt his conſcience, as the matter is repreſented abroad, or of getting him away. We are willing to give him liberty of conſcience;
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:012367_0077_0F89258AEB6738A8"/>and expect the ſame liberty from him. And ſhould think it hard, if he endeavours to prevent any Miniſter's coming.</p>
            <p n="4">4th. and laſtly, I would propoſe, that ſeeing Mr. <hi>Robbins</hi>'s chief ſtick is about <hi>qualifications,</hi> if he will go on with the practice, he may <hi>examine</hi> the candidate as much as he pleaſes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> though we think there is no divine warrant for it, with reſpect to perſons baptized; but we would by no means have the practice wholly laid aſide.</p>
            <p>As to the method propoſed, of receiving the candidates to full communion, and then diſpenſing with their coming to the LORD'S table, which is again reurged, I have ſaid enough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. I would only add, that I look upon It as <hi>the old practice ſpoiled:</hi> A few circumſtances muſt be added to reader it non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſial, ridiculous and contradictory in itſelf. No church in the province practices any thing like it. A report indeed we have, that one church in <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>necticut</hi> have adopted ſome ſuch ſcheme, whether true or not we cannot tell; And if there be ſomething in it, we have no particular account of the plan; and ſhall we meerly upon ſuch a vague report, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting one Miniſter or church, make ſuch a material alteration as this? What preſumption? What head-long <hi>Jehu</hi>-like act would it be? I am confident, not one man that ſhould vote for it, but would be aſhamed of it before a twelve-month came about. May the LORD keep us from wrong paths: May he lead us into all truth, and direct us in the way of duty. May this church ſtill retain its precious privileges, and tranſmit them inviolate to the lateſt poſterity: And may no <hi>weapon</hi> formed againſt its welfare proſper.</p>
            <p>Perhaps thoſe who live at a diſtance may be deſirous to know how this diſpute terminated. Why, in ſhort, the church, with a view to peace, have voted to "diſſolve the meeting and to drop the affair for the preſent, and to reaſſume the confiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof when they ſhall think proper." Thus the matter is left in ſuſpence. The practice remains unrepealed, and the Miniſter as much unſatisfied with it as ever. So that the door ſeems at preſent ſtrut againſt all comers. How things will finally iſſue, is beyond me to ſay. But I truſt GOD will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule all to his glory, and the beſt good of his church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and bring this controverſy at laſt to a happy</p>
