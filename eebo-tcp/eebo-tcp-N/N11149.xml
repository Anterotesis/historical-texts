            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE TO THIS EDITION.</head>
            <p>THE gracious hand of Divine Providence in the preſervation of the <hi>New-England</hi> Colonies in their infant ſtate, gloriouſly appears, from the facts, briefly, but faithfully tranſmitted down to us, by one of our venerable forefathers in the following NARRATIVE of the Troubles with the Indians in <hi>New-England,</hi> a very numerous and barbarous people, diſperſed through the wilderneſs in every part of the land.</p>
            <p>THESE Savages began a War with the firſt Engliſh Adventurers, while they were few in number, yea very few, and ſtrangers in the land. This rendered their deliverance an event truly great and memorable.</p>
            <p>THEY were ſaved indeed, as by fire: Their loſs of men and ſubſtance, compared with their numbers and ability, was very great, and long ſeverely felt.</p>
            <p>HEAVY as the public expences were to ſupport the War, theſe were but a very inconſiderable part of the burdens and charges to which particular towns, fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and individuals were neceſſarily ſubjected, in guards, garriſons, and watchings in their own defence.</p>
            <p>THE whole Country was the ſeat of War, and every man procured his bread in jeopardy of his life.</p>
            <p>LIKE Nehemiah's builders, each one toiled with his weapon of war in one hand, and his inſtrument of labor
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:014120_0004_0F92FEF23AF454B8"/>in the other; expoſed every moment to death, from a watchful unſeen foe.</p>
            <p>IN the frequent alarms which ſpread from town to town, ſome eſcaping from danger, ran into greater; others met their own fate in their attempts to relieve their neighbours in the ſame, or different ſcattered ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements.</p>
            <p>THIS was the deplorable ſtate of the <hi>New-England</hi> colonies, a very few towns excepted; a diſtreſs, more eaſily conceived than expreſſed, and indeed ſcarcely conceivable by the greater part of the preſent genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſince the then hideous wilderneſs is become a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful field, and well ſettled towns overſpread the land.</p>
            <p>THE reader unacquainted with this country in its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated ſtate, may here inquire, Why the firſt ſettlers thus expoſed themſelves, by making disjoined and very diſtant ſettlements? Neceſſity led to this: The lands near the ſea-coaſts were generally leſs fertile, and found hard to ſubdue; therefore, for preſent ſubſiſtence in their feeble condition, they were obliged to ſeek the borders of rivers and ſtreams, for the ſake of intervals and meadows, both on account of their fertility, and of their being open and prepared for immediate improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>THEY were alſo encouraged in making theſe ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſettlements by the general friendly diſpoſition of the Natives, who freely ſold their lands, for which a valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſideration was paid, without exception, where a claim was made.</p>
            <p>THE Indians perceived their intereſt in admitting their Engliſh neighbours, as they furniſhed them with means of much eaſier ſubſiſtence; and the utmoſt care was taken by the ſeveral governments of the united co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ies, to prevent every occaſion of diſtruſt,</p>

THE <hi>Pequod</hi> War was confined to the weſterly parts of <hi>Connecticut.</hi>

            <p>PHILLIP'S War, as it is called, began in <hi>Plymouth Colony,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">His Head-Quarters were at <hi>Mount-Hope,</hi> now <hi>Briſtol.</hi>
               </note> but ſpread through the <hi>Maſſachuſetts, New-Hampſhire,</hi> and province of <hi>Main,</hi> in extent above 300 miles. And within the compaſs of one year, the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous tribes of Savages within the limits of <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> were drawn into this war againſt us, a very few excepted.</p>
            <p>SURELY we may ſay, had not the Lord been on our ſide, when men thus roſe up againſt us, they had quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſwallowed us up.</p>
            <p>OUR Fathers, indeed, had come out of great tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, into this wilderneſs, which, under Providence was a means of improving them in faith, fortitude and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, to endure hardſhips beyond a parallel, 'till they obtained deliverance: And ſome of the firſt adventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers lived to ſee the wilderneſs become a fruitful field.</p>
            <p>BUT this was not their intended reſt: They had ſublimer views: They looked for another and be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ter country, that is an heavenly. And however they may have been miſrepreſented, by ignorant or ill-deſigning perſons, they were men of whom the world was not worthy.</p>
            <p>THE cruel charges of peculiar bigotry, and a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting ſpirit, wantonly alledged againſt them, are found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on facts not truly ſtated.</p>

ACCORDING to the natural courſe of things in this depraved and mutable ſtate, their deſcendants at this day, as might be expected, have in a meaſure, departed from that ſimplicity of manners, by which their renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed anceſtors were juſtly diſtinguiſhed: But notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it may with truth be aſſerted, that no inſtance can be produced, in the preſent or any paſt age, among like numbers, where good order has ſo univerſally prevailed, as in the <hi>New-England</hi> colonies, even in populous and opulent towns, eſpecially our CAPITAL.</p>
            <p>WE of this province, with inconſiderable intermiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, from that early period, at unknown expence and loſs, have been called to defend our lives and properties againſt the incurſions of more diſtant ſavages. Our truſt hath been in the name of the Lord, our fathers God and Deliverer; and hitherto he hath delivered us. May we never be unmindful of his ſignal benefits!</p>
            <p>WE are now, under the ſmiles of divine Providence, encreaſed to a multitude of people.</p>
            <p>OUR many frontier ſettlements are continually expoſed to ſavage invaſion: And though we truſt not to our own bow; yet, as prudence directs, we are all armed and prepared for a defenſive War. And yet, having the wormwood and the gall ſtill in remembrance, no peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple more ardently wiſh and pray, that Wars may forever ceaſe, and peace on earth, and good will among men, univerſally prevail.</p>

To whom the honor of its inveſtigation doth of right more properly belong, is ſufficiently declared by the hiſtory and reports of ſuch as were eye-witneſſes thereof, and not intended to be any part of the preſent diſquiſition.

But upon examination of the other Indian, who was brought priſoner to them, they found that all the <hi>Sachems</hi> of the <hi>Narrhaganſets,</hi> except <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicus</hi> and <hi>Miantonimo,</hi> were contrivers of <hi>John Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s death, and the occaſion was becauſe he went to make peace, and trade with the <hi>Pequods</hi> laſt year: The priſoner ſaid alſo that <hi>Oldham</hi>'s two Indians were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it; but becauſe they were ſent as meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from <hi>Canonicus,</hi> they would not impriſon them: But the Governor wrote back to Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> to let the <hi>Narrhaganſets</hi> know, they expected they ſhould ſend home <hi>John Oldham</hi>'s two boys, and take revenge upon the Iſlanders, and withal gave Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> caution to look to himſelf, if there ſhould be occaſion to make war with the <hi>Narrhaganſets</hi> (for <hi>Block-Iſland</hi> was under them) and the next day he wrote to <hi>Canonicus,</hi> by one of thoſe Indians, that he had ſuſpicion of him that was ſent, and yet he had ſent him back, becauſe he was a meſſenger: but did expect, if he ſhould ſend for the ſaid two Indians, he ſhould ſend them to him.</p>
            <p>FOUR days after <hi>John Oldham</hi>'s two boys were ſent home by one of <hi>Miantonimo</hi>'s men, with a letter from Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> that <hi>Miantonimo</hi> had cauſed the <hi>Sachem</hi> of <hi>Niantick</hi> to ſend to <hi>Block-Iſland</hi> for them, and that he had near 100 fathom of peag, and much other goods of <hi>Oldham</hi>'s which ſhould be reſerved for them. And three of the ſeven that were drowned were <hi>Sachems,</hi> and that one of the two which was hired by the <hi>Niantick Sachem,</hi> was dead alſo. So they wrote back to have the reſt of thoſe which were neceſſary to be ſent, and the reſt of the goods, and that he ſhould tell <hi>Canonicus</hi> and <hi>Miantonimo</hi> that they held them innocent, but the ſix other <hi>Sachems</hi> were guilty.</p>

LIEUT. <hi>Gibbons</hi> and Mr. <hi>Higginſon</hi> were ſent ſoon after with <hi>Cuſhamakin</hi> the <hi>Sachem</hi> of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts,</hi> to <hi>Canonicus,</hi> to treat with him about the murder of <hi>John Oldham.</hi> They returned with acceptance and good ſucceſs of their buſineſs; obſerving in the <hi>Sachem</hi> much ſtate, great command of his men, and marvellous wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in his anſwers; and in the carriage of the whole treaty clearing himſelf and his neighbours of the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and offering revenge of it, yet upon very ſafe and wary conditions.</p>
            <p>THE Engliſh of <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> after the peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with the <hi>Pequods,</hi> ſent a bark thither for trade, that trial might be made of the reality of their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but they found them treacherous and falſe, and that no advantage was to be had by any commerce with them, inſomuch as they took up a reſolution never more to have to do with them; which the ſaid Indians perceiving, made no account of the former peace, but took all advantage to do us miſchief, not only by har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring thoſe who had murthered Mr. <hi>Oldham,</hi> but ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing many of the Engliſh in the year 1636, when <hi>Connecticut</hi> river began firſt to be planted, divers of whom were killed (nine at one time in <hi>April,</hi> 1637) by them about <hi>Wethersfield,</hi> when the plantation then firſt began, ſo as they could not paſs up and down the river without a guard, but they would be in danger of being cut off or carried away, as two maids were ſaid to be; thirty men have been killed by them in all; thoſe who fell into their hands alive, were cruelly tortured, after a moſt barbarous manner, by inſulting over their priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in a blaſphemous wiſe, when in their dying agonies, under the extremity of their pains (their fleſh being firſt flaſhed with knives, and then filled with burning em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers) they called upon God and Chriſt with gaſping groans, reſigning up their ſouls into their hands; with which words theſe wretched caitifs uſed to mock the Engliſh afterward, when they came within their hearing and view.</p>
            <p>ABOUT the ſame time ſome agents ſent over by the Lord <hi>Say,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Brook,</hi> built a fort at the mouth
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:014120_0019_0F92FF001DE33308"/>of <hi>Connecticut</hi> river, wherein was placed one Lieutenant <hi>Gardiner,</hi> and a convenient number of ſoldiers to ſecure the place, intended ſoon after to be planted, but all the winter following, being the end of the year 1636, they were little better than beſieged by the ſaid ſavages, not daring to ſtir out of command of the fort, but they were ready to be ſeized by theſe their barbarous enemies: At one time the Lieutenant himſelf with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>en or twelve of the ſoldiers, marching out of the fort, with intent to paſs over a neck of land, to burn the marſhes; as ſoon as they had paſſed over the ſtreight of the neck, they eſpied a company of Indians making towards the ſaid iſthmus, which if they could not recover, they ſee they muſt all periſh; whereupon returning back with all ſpeed, they very narrowly eſcaped, and were two or three of them killed notwithſtanding, before they could get back into the fort, which was preſently ſurrounded with multitudes of them; but the diſcharging of a piece of ordnance gave them warning to keep further from the walls. Sometimes they came with their canoes into the river in view of the ſoldiers within the fort, and when they apprehended themſelves out of reach of their guns, they would imitate the dying groans and invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the poor captive Engliſh, which the Engliſh ſoldiers were forced with ſilent patience to bear, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then in a capacity to requite their inſolent blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. But they being by theſe horrible outrages juſtly provoked to indignation, unanimouſly agreed to join their forces together, to root them out of the earth, with God's aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>THE Governor and Council having ſoon after aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled the reſt of the magiſtrates, and the miniſters, to adviſe with them about doing juſtice for <hi>Oldham</hi>'s death, they all agreed that it ſhould be done with all expedition; and accordingly on the 25th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, 80 or 90 men were ſent out under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Capt. <hi>Endicot</hi> of <hi>Salem,</hi> who went to the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quod</hi> country by water, with commiſſion to treat with the ſaid <hi>Pequods,</hi> firſt offering terms of peace, if they
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:014120_0020_0F92FF00F63C5A88"/>would ſurrender the murderers of the Engliſh, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear further acts of hoſtility, or elſe fight them.</p>
            <p>THE Captain aforeſaid coming aſhore with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, by a meſſage ſent them by an interpreter, obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome little ſpeech with a great number of them at a diſtance; but after they underſtood what was propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, firſt cunningly getting behind a hill, they preſently ran away into the woods and ſwamps, where there was no purſuing of them: however, one diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a gun among them as they were taking their flight, ſtayed the courſe of one, which was all that could be done againſt them at that time.</p>
            <p>WINTER approaching, and no encouragement pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting further to purſue them at that time, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved better to return back for the preſent, and wait a further ſeaſon, when more forces could be gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to purſue the quarrel to the utmoſt.</p>
            <p>MIANTONIMO ſoon after ſent a meſſage to them with a letter from Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> to ſignify that they had taken one of the Indians, who had broken priſon, and had him ſafe for them, when they ſhould ſend for him (as they had before ſent to him for that end) and that the other had ſtolen away (not knowing it ſeems that he was their priſoner) and that according to their promiſe they would not entertain any of that Iſland, which ſhould come to them; but they conceived it was rather in love to him whom they concealed, for he had been his ſervant formerly, but when they ſent for thoſe two Indians, one was ſent them, but the other was ſaid to be dead before the meſſenger came: But the <hi>Pequods</hi> harboured thoſe of <hi>Block-Iſland,</hi> and therefore juſtly brought the revenge of the Engliſh upon them.</p>
            <p>AMONGST thoſe ſoldiers that were ſent under Capt. <hi>Endicot,</hi> were twenty that belonged to <hi>Saybrook</hi>-fort, and were appointed to ſtay there, to defend the place againſt the <hi>Pequods:</hi> After the ſaid Capt. and the reſt
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:014120_0021_0F92FF01A189B568"/>were departed, thoſe twenty lay wind bound in the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quod</hi> harbour, and in the mean while went all of them aſhore, with ſacks to fetch ſome of the <hi>Pequods</hi> corn: and having fetched each man one ſack full to their boat, they returned for more, and having loaded themſelves the Indians ſet upon them, ſo they laid down their corn, and gave fire upon the Indians, and the Indians ſhot their arrows againſt them; the place was open about the diſtance of a muſket ſhot; the Indians kept the covert, ſave when they came forth one at a time and diſcharged their arrows: The Engliſh put themſelves in a ſingle file, and ten only that had pieces that could reach them, ſhot, the others ſtood ready to keep them from breaking in. So they continued moſt part of the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon; the Engliſh, as they ſuppoſed, killed divers of them, and hurt others; and the Indians wounded but one of the Engliſh, who was armed, all the reſt being without: For they ſhot their arrows compaſs-wiſe, ſo as they could eaſily ſee and avoid them ſtanding ſingle, then always gathered up their arrows: At the laſt the Indians being weary of the ſport, gave the Engliſh leave to retire to their boat.—This was in <hi>October,</hi> 1636.</p>
            <p>ABOUT two days after, five men of <hi>Saybrook</hi> went up the river about four miles to fetch hay out of a meadow on the <hi>Pequod</hi> ſide: The graſs was ſo high as ſome <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quods</hi> hiding themſelves in it, ſet upon the Engliſh before they were aware, and took one that had hay on his back, the reſt fled to their boat, one of them had five arrows in him, yet recovered: He that was taken was a goodly young man, whoſe name was <hi>Butterfield;</hi> whereupon the meadow was ever after called <hi>Butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi>'s meadow.</p>
            <q>Icarus Icariis nomina dedit aquis.</q>
            <p>ABOUT fourteen days after, ſix of the ſoldiers were ſent out of the fort to keep an houſe which they had ſet up in a corn-field, about two miles from the fort. Three of them went forth a fowling, which the Lieutenant had ſtrictly forbidden, two had pieces, and the third only a ſword, when ſuddenly about an hundred Indians came
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:014120_0022_0F92FF029B0F9CC0"/>out of the covert and ſet upon them, he who had the ſword brake through, and received only two ſhot, and thoſe not dangerous, and ſo eſcaped to the houſe which was not above a bow ſhot off, and perſwaded the other two to follow, but they ſtayed ſtill, 'till the Indians came and took them, and carried them away with their pieces. Soon after they beat down the ſaid houſe, and out-houſes, and hay ſtacks, and within a bow ſhot of the fort, killed a cow, and ſhot divers others, which came home with arrows ſticking in them.</p>
            <p>AFTER Mr. <hi>Endicot</hi>'s departure, the <hi>Pequods</hi> perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they had by ſeveral late injuries and outrages, drawn upon themſelves the hatred of all the Engliſh, as well as of their own people by former wrongs, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſting their own ability to deal with them all at once, did at the laſt by all ſubtle inſinuations and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions, try to make their peace with the <hi>Narrhagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets,</hi> uſing ſuch arguments as to right reaſon ſeemed not only pregnant to the purpoſe, but alſo (if revenge, that bewitching and pleaſing paſſion of man's mind had not blinded their eyes) moſt cogent and invincible: But they were, by the good providence of God, with-held from embracing thoſe counſels, which might otherways have proved moſt pernicious to the deſign of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, viz. That the Engliſh were ſtrangers, and began to overſpread the country, the which would ſoon be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by them to the depriving the ancient inhabitants of their right, if they were not timely prevented; and that the <hi>Narrhaganſets</hi> would but make way for their own ruin, by helping to deſtroy the <hi>Pequods;</hi> for after themſelves were ſubdued, it would not be long ere the <hi>Narrhaganſets</hi> themſelves, would in the next place be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ooted out likewiſe: whereas if they would but join to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether againſt the Engliſh they could demonſtrate how the Engliſh might eaſily either be deſtroyed or forced to leave the country, and that without any danger to themſelves: Telling them alſo that they never need come to any open battles, they might deſtroy them only by firing their houſes, and killing their cattle, and lying in wait for them as they went about their ordinary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions;
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:014120_0023_0F92FF031EBE29B8"/>which courſe if it were purſued, they ſaid their new and unwelcome neighbours could not long ſubſiſt; but would either be ſtarved with hunger and cold, or forced to forſake the country.</p>
            <p>MATCHIAVEL himſelf if he had ſat in counſel with them could not have inſinuated ſtronger reaſons to have perſwaded them to a peace.</p>
            <p>IT is ſaid that ſo much reaſon was apprehended in theſe motives, that the <hi>Narrhaganſets</hi> were once waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and were almoſt perſwaded to have granted an ear to their advice and perſwaſion and joined all againſt the Engliſh; but when they conſidered what an advantage they had put into their hands by the ſtrength and favor of the Engliſh, to take a full revenge of all their former injuries, upon their inveterate enemies, the thought of that was ſo ſweet, that it turned the ſcale againſt all other conſiderations whatſoever.</p>
            <p>SOON after this, <hi>Miantonimo</hi> Sachem of the <hi>Narrha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganſets,</hi> came to <hi>Boſton</hi> (being ſent for by theGovernor) with two of <hi>Canonicus</hi>'s ſons, and another Sachem, and near twenty of their men, whom they call Sannaps. The Governor, having notice by <hi>Cuſhamakin</hi> the <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts</hi> Sachem, ſent twenty muſketeers to <hi>Roxbury</hi> to meet them. They came to <hi>Boſton</hi> about noon, where the Governor had called together all the Magiſtrates and Miniſters to give countenance to their proceedings, and to adviſe about the terms of peace. After dinner, <hi>Miantonimo</hi> declared what he had to ſay to them in ſeveral propoſitions, which were to this effect, that they had always loved the Engliſh, and now deſired a firm peace with them, and that they would continue war with the <hi>Pequods,</hi> and their confederates, till they were ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and deſired the Engliſh would do ſo too: Promiſing to deliver their enemies to them, or kill them, and two months after to ſend them a preſent. The Governor told them they ſhould have an anſwer the next morning, which was done, upon articles ſubſcribed by him, and
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:014120_0024_0F92FF0646FA58B0"/>they alſo ſubſcribed with him, wherein a firm peace was concluded, but becauſe they could not make them well underſtand the articles, they told them they would ſend a copy of them to Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> who could beſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the ſame to them. So after dinner they took leave, and were conveyed out of town by ſome muſketeers, and diſmiſſed with a volley of ſhot.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ARTICLES</hi> here follow.</p>
            <p n="1">I. A FIRM peace betwixt them and their friends on either part (if they conſent) and their confederates (if they will obſerve the articles) and their poſterity.</p>
            <p n="2">II. NEITHER part to make peace with the <hi>Pequods</hi> without the others conſent.</p>
            <p n="3">III. NOT to harbour any of the <hi>Pequods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. TO put to death, or deliver up any of the murderers of the Engliſh.</p>
            <p n="5">V. TO return fugitive ſervants.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. THE Engliſh to give them notice when they go out againſt the <hi>Pequods,</hi> and the other to ſend them guides.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. FREE trade to be between them.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. NONE of them to come near the Engliſh plantations during the war with the <hi>Pequods,</hi> without ſome Engliſhman, or known Indian.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. TO continue to the poſterity of both parts.</p>
            <p>THESE Articles were indifferently well obſerved by the <hi>Narrhaganſetts,</hi> till the <hi>Pequods,</hi> their mortal ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, were totally ſubdued; but then they began to grow inſolent and treacherous, eſpecially this <hi>Miantonimo</hi> himſelf; as will appear in the ſequel.</p>

            <p>THE colony of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> determined to ſend an hundred and ſixty, of whom an hundred and twenty were ordered under the conduct of Capt. <hi>Patrick</hi> of <hi>Watertown,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Traſk</hi> of <hi>Salem,</hi> Capt. <hi>Stoughton</hi> of <hi>Dorcheſter</hi> being to command in chief; with whom was ſent that holy man of God, Mr. <hi>John Wilſon,</hi> (paſtor of the church of <hi>Boſton</hi>) the chariots and horſemen of our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by whoſe faith and prayer, as ſometimes was ſaid of <hi>Luther</hi> (in reference to <hi>Germany</hi>) the country was preſerved, ſo as it was confidently believed that no enemy ſhould break in upon a place whilſt he ſurvived, which as ſome have obſerved accordingly came to paſs.</p>
            <p>THE matter requiring great expedition, and it being long before the whole company could be diſpatched away, Capt. <hi>Patrick</hi> with forty men were ſent before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, to be ſure to meet with thoſe of <hi>Connecticut</hi> in caſe they ſhould be in action, before the reſt of our forces could get into a readineſs, which accordingly come to paſs; for the main buſineſs in taking the fort was over, even before the ſaid <hi>Patrick</hi> could get thither. Capt. <hi>Underhill</hi> was ſent by Mr. <hi>Vane</hi> the Governor to <hi>Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook</hi> the winter before to ſtrengthen the garriſon there. The aſſaulting and ſurprizing of this Indian fort, being the moſt remarkable piece of ſervice in that whole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition; take it as it was delivered in writing by that valiant, faithful, and prudent commander, Capt. <hi>Maſon,</hi> chief in the action, who lived long after to reap the fruit of his labor, and enjoy the benefit of that day's ſervice, having an inheritance given him in that part of the country, as a juſt reward of his faithful ſervice on that day as well as at other times. <hi>Wequaſh</hi> a <hi>Pequed</hi> by nation, but diſguſted by the Sachem, proved a good guide to the Engliſh, by whoſe direction they were led to a fort near <hi>Myſtick</hi> river, ſome miles nearer than <hi>Saſſacous</hi>'s fort, which they firſt intended to aſſault.</p>
            <q>
               <p>ON the ſecond Wedneſday of <hi>May,</hi> being the tenth day of that month, we ſet ſail with ninety men of the

               <p>ON Monday we all landed at <hi>Saybrook:</hi> fort, and ſtayed there 'till Tueſday; Capt. <hi>Underhill</hi> joining nineteen men with himſelf to us: Whereupon we ſent back twenty of ours to ſtrengthen our planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and ſo ſet ſail on Thurſday towards <hi>Narrha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganſet,</hi> and arrived there on Friday.</p>
               <p>ON Saturday myſelf, with Capt. <hi>Underhill,</hi> and Lieut. <hi>Sealy,</hi> with our guard marched to <hi>Canonicus</hi> by land, being about five miles diſtant, where we were kindly entertained after their manner: Having had parly with him, we ſent to <hi>Miantonimo,</hi> who would give no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent anſwer; and ſo our Sabbath being on the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, we adjourned our meeting until Monday, at which time there aſſembled <hi>Miantonimo</hi> with the chiefeſt of them about two hundred men; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſolemnly ſet for conſultation after their manner, told them we were now going, God aſſiſting, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the wrong committed and blood-ſhed by their and our enemies, upon our native country-men, not any way deſiring their aid, unleſs they would volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily ſend, which they did exceedingly approve of: Moreover we told them that the Engliſh and they had always been friends for ought we knew, and ſo we were with the Indians that had not wronged Engliſh-men, the which they acknowledged, and ſo made a large deſcription of the <hi>Pequods</hi> country, and told us they would ſend men with us; ſo we reſolved there to keep our rendezvous at <hi>Canonicus</hi> his plantation on the morrow night, being Tueſday; but the wind being ſtiff, we could not land our men 'till five or
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:014120_0028_0F92FF09336AD398"/>ſix of the clock in the afternoon, at which time I landed on <hi>Narrhaganſet</hi> ſhore with thirty-two men, and ſo marched to the place of rendezvous formerly appointed: Capt. <hi>Underhill</hi> and my Lieut, landed the reſt, and came up to me that night. About two hours before day came an Indian with a letter from Capt. <hi>Patrick,</hi> being then at Mr. <hi>Robert Williams</hi>'s plantation with forty men, who deſired us to ſtay for his coming and joining us, not intimating when that would be: The which being conſidered and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, we thought it could not be our ſafeſt courſe to wait for him, (though his preſent aſſiſtance was much deſired) for theſe reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. BECAUSE the day before when we had abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely reſolved to go, the Indians plainly told us they tho't we were but in jeſt, and alſo that Engliſh-men did talk much, but not fight; nay, they concluded that they would not go on; and beſides if we ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, we feared we ſhould be diſcovered by reaſon of the frequent recourſe between them by certain <hi>Squaws</hi> (who have mutual intercourſe) whereupon we were conſtrained to ſet forward towards the <hi>Pequods,</hi> with ſeventy-ſeven Engliſh, and about ſixty river Indians, and as I ſuppoſe near about two hundred <hi>Narrha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganſets,</hi> and marched that night to the eaſtern <hi>Nian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> where we kept our rendezvous that night; the Sachem of the place adding about an hundred of his men unto us.</p>
               <p>WE ſet forward and marched about ten miles, where making an alta (or halt) there we held a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation with the Indians, who deſired to know what we intended? We told them that we reſolved to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault <hi>Saſſacous</hi> his fort, at which they were all ſtrick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="31" facs="unknown:014120_0029_0F92FF09F084D278"/>leſs; and marching on five miles further, we made another alta, where they told us we had near a dozen miles to <hi>Saſſacous</hi> his fort, as we gathered by their relation: Being very weary in travelling with our arms, ammunition and proviſion; we were conſtrained to alter our reſolution, and reſolve to attempt that fort, the which they had formerly deſcribed to be three or four miles nearer; and alſo one of Capt. <hi>Underhill</hi>'s men failing put it out of doubt. But whoſoever ſaith that Capt. <hi>Underhill</hi> had any falling out about that or any thing elſe, doth ſpeak untruth; for we both reſolved to <hi>Saſſacous</hi> his fort, as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in our conſultation at <hi>Narrhaganſet;</hi> and ſo continued our reſolution 'till we received the former reaſons as grounds ſufficient to perſwade us to the contrary, and to proſecute that which was moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be accompliſhed.</p>
               <p>THEY drew a plot of the ſituation of the <hi>Pequods</hi> and deſcribed <hi>Saſſacous</hi> his fort to be the neareſt, which was the chief cauſe we determined to aſſault that firſt, and had no reaſon leading till our laſt alta, where, upon the reaſons formerly mentioned, we changed our reſolution: This greatly pleaſed the Indians that were with us, as it was what they much deſired; for it was dreadful to them to hear the name of <hi>Saſſacous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FROM thence we marched two or three miles where we kept our rendezvous, ſuppoſing we had been within one mile of the fort: An Indian ſent to diſcover beforehand, brought us news that they were ſecure, having been fiſhing with many canoes at ſea, and divers of them walking here and there.</p>
               <p>ABOUT two hours before day we marched toward the fort, being weary and much ſpent; many of us having ſlept nothing at all.</p>
               <p>AND ſo we began to march towards the fort, the Lord being pleaſed wonderfully to aſſiſt and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:014120_0030_0F92FF0AA7EC65E0"/>us, after a tedious march of three or four miles: About break of day we came fair in view of the fort, ſtanding on the top of an hill not ſteep; the Indians all falling back, were ſuddenly vaniſhed out of ſight, ſo we made an alta, and ſent back for our guide, who had promiſed to go with us to the fort, but his heart we ſaw much failed him; we aſked him what they intended who promiſed to wing us, and to ſurround the fort; he told us they were much afraid; but he, ſeeing our reſolution, went to them and prevailed with divers of them to come up to us; we told them their beſt courſe would be to flank the fort on both ſides, and having no time longer to confer, we proceeded: Capt. <hi>Underhill</hi> to the weſtern entrance with one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, myſelf with the other to the eaſtern as ſilent as poſſibly we could; ſo it pleaſed God we came up within two rod of the Paliſado, before we were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; at which time a dog began to bark, and an Indian cried out; but not being myſelf rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Indian guide, of the right entrance, though there was a little poſtern door, the which I had thought to have attempted to break down with my foot; but the Lord directed me otherwiſe for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for I then feared we could not there enter with our arms, which proved true. So I ſuddenly haſted to the Paliſado, and putting in the muzzle of my piece, diſcharged upon them, and ſo did the reſt with all celerity; we then ſuddenly haſtened on toward that ſide which ſtood toward the water; where I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded was an entrance, and inſtantly fell upon it, being only barred with two great forked boughs, or branches of ſome trees, and haſting over them I drew one after me; my Lieutenant drawing the other outward. We ſuddenly fell upon the wigwams; the Indians cried out in a moſt hideous manner, ſome iſſuing out of the wigwams, ſhooting at us deſperately, and ſo creeping under beds that they had. We had reſolved awhile not to have burned it, but being we could not come at them, I reſolved to ſet it on fire, after divers of them were ſlain, and ſome of our men ſore wounded; ſo entering one of their wigwams, I took a fire-brand

Many of them iſſuing forth were ſuddenly ſlain either by the Engliſh or Indians, who were in a ring without us; all being diſpatched and ended in the ſpace of an hour, having two of our men ſlain, and ſixteen wounded.</p>
               <p>BEING very hot and dry we could very hardly procure any water, we continued there one hour not knowing what courſe to take or which way to go, our Pinnaces not being come in, neither did we know how far, or which way to go to them, our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, being an Indian, we could hardly come to ſpeak with him: When we did, he knew nothing of what his countrymen intended, who were all hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried and diſtracted with a few hurt men, but chiefly as I conceive with fear of the enemy.</p>
               <p>BUT the enemy approaching they began to cleave unto us, and I verily think durſt not leave us.</p>
               <p>OUR Pinnaces then coming in view with a fair gale, being guided as it were to ſerve our neceſſity by the good hand of God, which I think was never more eminently ſeen in a matter of like moment and leſs of man in ſeveral paſſages. Then we ſet our men in order and prepared for fight, and began to march toward the harbour where the Pinnaces were to ride: The enemy approaching, Capt. <hi>Underhill</hi> with divers Indians and certain Engliſh iſſued out to encounter them, but they would not ſtand to it, for the moſt part they lay behind rocks, trees and buſhes. We marched on, they ſtill dodging of us; ſometimes hazarding themſelves in open field, where ſome of
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:014120_0032_0F92FF0CE23A44A0"/>them were ſlain in open view, and as we hear many wounded: I was ſomewhat cautelous in beſtowing many ſhot upon them needleſly, becauſe I expected a ſtrong oppoſition; and thus they continued to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us till we came within two miles of our Pinnaces, where they wholly left us, which was near ſix miles as I conceive, having then about two miles more to the river.</p>
               <p>FOUR of our wounded men we were forced to carry our ſelves, while at length we hired the Indians to bear them, both in this and all the following enterprizes againſt the <hi>Pequods.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>THIS ſervice being thus happily accompliſhed by theſe few hands that came from <hi>Connecticut;</hi> within a while after, the forces ſent from the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> under the conduct of Capt. <hi>Stoughton</hi> as commander in chief arrived there alſo, who found a great part of the work done to their hands, in the ſurprizal of the <hi>Pequods</hi> fort as aforeſaid, which yet was but the breaking of the neſt, and unkennelling thoſe ſavage wolves; for the body of them, with <hi>Saſſacous</hi> the chief Sachem (whoſe very name was a terror to all the <hi>Narrhaganſets</hi>) were diſperſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad and ſcattered all over their country, yet ſo far were the reſt diſmayed, that they never durſt make any aſſault upon the Engliſh, who in ſeveral parties were ſcattered about in purſuit of them.</p>
            <p>IT was not long after Capt. <hi>Stoughton</hi>'s ſoldiers came up before news was brought of a great number of the enemy, that were diſcovered by the ſide of a river up the country, being firſt trapanned by the <hi>Narrhagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets,</hi> under pretence of ſecuring them, but they were truly hemmed in by them, though at a diſtance, yet ſo as they could not, or durſt not ſtir from the place, by which means our forces of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> had an eaſy conqueſt of ſome hundreds of them, who were there couped up as in a pound; not daring to fight, not able to fly away, and ſo were all taken without any oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: The men among them to the number of 30, were
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:014120_0033_0F92FF0DAE98F868"/>turned preſently into <hi>Charon</hi>'s ferry-boat, under the command of ſkipper <hi>Gallop,</hi> who diſpatched them a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle without the harbour; the females and children were diſpoſed of according to the will of the conquerors, ſome being given to the <hi>Narrhaganſets,</hi> and other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians that aſſiſted in the ſervice.</p>
            <p>THE reſt of the enemy being firſt fired out of their ſtrong hold, were taken and deſtroyed, a great number of them being ſeized in the places where they intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have hid themſelves, the reſt fled out of their own country over <hi>Connecticut</hi> river, up toward the Dutch plantation. Our ſoldiers being reſolved by GOD'S aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to make a final deſtruction of them, were mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to purſue them which way ſoever they ſhould think to make their eſcape, to which end in the next place, our ſoldiers went by water towards <hi>New-Haven,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they heard, and which in reaſon was moſt likely, they bent their courſe: Soon after they were informed of a great number of them, that had betaken themſelves to a neighbouring place not far off, whither they might hope it was not likely they ſhould be purſued; but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſearch they found fifty or ſixty wigwams, but without any Indians in any of them, but heard that they had paſſed along toward the Dutch plantation; whereupon our ſoldiers that were before, all embarked for <hi>Quille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piack,</hi> afterwards called <hi>New-Haven,</hi> and being landed there, they had not far to march unto the place where it was moſt probable they ſhould either find or hear of them; accordingly in their march they met here and there with ſundry of them, whom they all ſlew or took priſoners, amongſt whom were two Sachems, whom they preſently beheaded; to a third that was either a Sachem or near a-kin to one, they gave his life upon condition that he ſhould go and enquire where <hi>Saſſacous</hi> was, and accordingly bring them word; this Indian, overlooking all other national or natural obligations, in conſideration of his life that was received on that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, proved very true and faithful to thoſe that ſent him; his order was to have returned in three days, but not being able within ſo ſhort a time to make a full

            <p>THE reſt of the <hi>Pequods</hi> from whom <hi>Saſſacous</hi> had made an eſcape, ſhifted every one for himſelf, leaving but three or four behind them (when a party of our ſoldiers according to the direction of him that was ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Mr. <hi>Ludlow</hi> and Capt. <hi>Maſon</hi> with half a ſcore of their men happened to diſcover this crew. Capt. <hi>Patrick</hi> and Capt. <hi>Traſk</hi> with about an hundred of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> forces came in upon them preſently after the alarm was given; ſuch commanders as firſt happened to be there gave ſpecial or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that the ſwamp ſhould be ſurrounded (being about a mile in compaſs) but Lieut. <hi>Davenport</hi> belonging to Capt. <hi>Traſk</hi>'s company, not hearing the word of command, with a dozen more of his company, in an over eager purſuit of the enemy, ruſhed immediately into the ſwamp, where they were very rudely entertained by thoſe evening wolves that newly kennelled therein; for Lieut. <hi>Davenport</hi> was ſorely wounded in the body, <hi>John Wedgwood</hi> of <hi>Ipſwich</hi> in the belly, and was laid hold on by ſome of the Indians; <hi>Thomas Sherman</hi> of ſaid <hi>Ipſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi> in the neck; ſome of their neighbours that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured in with them were in danger of the enemy's arrows that flew very thick about them, others were in as much hazard of being ſwallowed by the miry boggs of the
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:014120_0036_0F92FF10D4737940"/>ſwamp, wherein they ſtuck ſo faſt, that, if Serjeant <hi>Riggs</hi> of <hi>Roxbury</hi> had not reſcued two or three of them, they had fallen into the hands of the enemy; but ſuch was the ſtrength and courage of thoſe that came to their reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue, that ſome of the Indians being ſlain with their ſwords, their friends were quickly relieved, and drawn out of the mire and danger.</p>
            <p>BUT the Indians of the place, who had for company ſake run with their gueſts the <hi>Pequods</hi> into the ſwamp, did not love their friendſhip ſo well as to be killed with them alſo for company ſake, wherefore they began to bethink themſelves that they had done no wrong to the Engliſh, and deſired a parly, which was granted, and they preſently underſtood one another by the means of <hi>Thomas Stanton</hi> an exact interpreter then at hand. Upon which the Sachem of the place with ſeveral others and their wives and children, that liked better to live quietly in their wigwams than to be buried in the ſwamp, came forth and had their lives granted them: After ſome time of further parly with theſe, the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter was ſent in to offer the like terms to the reſt, but they were poſſeſſed with ſuch a ſpirit of ſtupidity and ſullenneſs that they reſolved rather to ſell their lives for what they could get there; and to that end began to let fly their arrows thick againſt him as intending to make his blood ſome part of the price of their own; but thro' the goodneſs of God toward him, his life was not to be ſold on that account, he being preſently fetched off.</p>
            <p>BY this time night drawing on, our commanders perceiving on which ſide of the ſwamp the enemies were lodged, gave orders to cut through the ſwamp with their ſwords, that they might the better hem them round in one corner, which was preſently done, and ſo they were begirt in all night, the Engliſh in the circumference plying them with ſhot all the time, by which means many of them were killed and buried in the mire, as they found the next day. The ſwamp by the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned device being reduced to ſo narrow a compaſs, that our ſoldiers ſtanding at twelve feet diſtance could ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:014120_0037_0F92FF11A1833D28"/>it, the enemy was kept in all the night; but a little before day-break (by reaſon of the fogg that uſeth to ariſe about that time, obſerved to be the darkeſt time of the night) twenty or thirty of the luſtieſt of the enemy broke through the beſiegers, and eſcaped away into the woods, ſome by violence and ſome by ſtealth dropping away, ſome of whom notwithſtanding were killed in the purſuit; the reſt were leſt to the mercy of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, of which many were killed in the ſwamp like ſullen dogs, that would rather in their ſelf-willedneſs and madneſs ſit ſtill to be ſhot through or cut in pieces, than receive their lives for aſking at the hand of thoſe into whoſe power they were now fallen. Some that are yet living and worthy of credit do affirm, that in the morning entering into the ſwamp, they ſaw ſeveral heaps of them ſitting cloſe together, upon whom they diſcharged their pieces laden with ten or twelve piſtol bullets at a time, putting the muzzels of their pieces un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the boughs within a few yards of them; ſo as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe that were found dead (near twenty it was judged) many more were killed and ſunk into the mire and never were minded more by friend or foe: Of thoſe who were not ſo deſperate or ſullen to ſell their lives for nothing, but yielded in time, the male children were ſent to the <hi>Bermudas,</hi> of the females ſome were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Engliſh towns, ſome were diſpoſed of among the other Indians, to whom they were deadly enemies as well as to ourſelves.</p>
            <p>THIS overthrow given to the <hi>Pequods</hi> ſtruck ſuch a terror into all the Indians in thoſe parts (ſome of whom had been ill-affected to the Engliſh before) that they ſought our friendſhip, and rendered themſelves to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our protection, which they then obtained, and have never ſince forfeited it any of them till this late rebellion of <hi>Philip</hi> the ſubject of the following diſcourſe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt of the priſoners ſpecial notice was taken of the wife of a noted Indian called <hi>Mononotto,</hi> who with her children ſubmitted herſelf, or by the chance of the war fell into the hands of the Engliſh: it was known to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

            <p>ON the 12th of <hi>July,</hi> 1637, one <hi>Aganemo,</hi> a Sachem of the <hi>Niantick</hi> Indians (who were a branch of the <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haganſets)</hi> came to <hi>Boſton</hi> with ſeventeen of his own men; he made divers propoſitions to the Engliſh, which they took into conſideration, and promiſed to give him an anſwer the next day: But finding that he had reſcued divers of the <hi>Pequods,</hi> ſubmitting to him ſince the laſt defeat, they firſt demanded the delivery of them, which he ſticking at, they refuſed further confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with him: But the next morning he came and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered what they deſired. So the Governor referred him to the Captains at the <hi>Pequod</hi> country, and writ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to them how to deal with him. So receiving his ten fathom of wampam, they friendly diſmiſs'd him.</p>

            <p>THIS was the iſſue of the <hi>Pequod</hi> war, which in the day of it here in <hi>New-England</hi> was as formidable to the country in general as the preſent war with <hi>Philip;</hi> the experience of which, becauſe it may adminiſter much matter of comfort and encouragement to the ſurviving generation, as well as of praiſe and thankſgiving to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, from all thoſe who have thus long quietly enjoyed the benefit and reaped the frui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>AFTER ſubduing the <hi>Pequods</hi> in the year 1637, the <hi>Narrhaganſets</hi> the moſt numerous of the other Indians, either out of diſcontent, that the whole ſovereignty over the reſt of the Indians was not adjudged to belong to them, or out of envy, that <hi>Uncas</hi> the chief Sachem of the <hi>Mohegin</hi> Indians, had inſinuated further than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the ſavor of the Engliſh, were obſerved to be
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:014120_0040_0F92FF13AD8DCDE0"/>always contriving miſchief againſt them, notwithſtand-a firm agreement was made between the Engliſh and the ſaid <hi>Narrhaganſets</hi> in the year 1637, when they had helped to deſtroy the <hi>Pequods,</hi> and alſo notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the triple league between the ſaid <hi>Narrhagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets,</hi> the <hi>Mohegins</hi> and the Engliſh at <hi>Hartford</hi> (the chief town of <hi>Connecticut)</hi> made in the year 1638, wherein the ſaid Indians were ſolemnly engaged, not to quarrel with the <hi>Mohegins</hi> or any other Indians, until they had firſt aſked the advice of the Engliſh, to whoſe determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, they had likewiſe obliged themſelves to ſtand, in all following differences among them. They carried it ſubtilly and underhand for ſome years, and were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending quarrels with the ſaid <hi>Uncas,</hi> againſt whom they always had an inveterate malice, ever ſince the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made about diſtributing the <hi>Pequods,</hi> after the war with them was ended; expecting in all probability that all ſhould have been left to their ſole arbitriment. The <hi>Mohegins</hi> on the other ſide, though not ſo numerous, yet a more warlike people and more politic, always made their recourſe to the Engliſh, complaining of the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of the <hi>Narrhaganſets,</hi> contrary to their league, ſo as they would hardly be kept from making open war againſt them, when they ſaw all other attempts to kill and deſtroy <hi>Uncas</hi> the <hi>Mohegin</hi> Sachem, by treachery, poiſon, and ſorcery, prove ineffectual. Inſomuch that at laſt the malice of <hi>Miantonimo</hi> and his <hi>Narrhaganſets</hi> grew to that height, that they began to plot againſt the Engliſh themſelves, for defending of <hi>Uncas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Narrhaganſets</hi> were animated by the haughty ſpirit and aſpiring mind of <hi>Miantonimo,</hi> the heir appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of all the <hi>Narrhaganſet</hi> people, after the deceaſe of the old Sachem, <hi>Canonicus,</hi> who was his uncle. This <hi>Miantonimo</hi> was a very goodly perſonage, of tall ſtature, ſubtil and cunning in his contrivements, as well as haughty in his deſigns. It was ſtrongly ſuſpected that in the year 1642, he had contrived to draw all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians throughout the country into a general conſpiracy againſt the Engliſh: For, the firſt of <hi>September,</hi> 1642, letters came to <hi>Boſton</hi> from the Court at <hi>Connecticut,</hi> and
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:014120_0041_0F92FF145F590640"/>from two of the Magiſtrates there, that the Indians had conſpired to cut off the Engliſh all over the country: Mr. <hi>Ludlow</hi> certified ſo much from the place where he lived near the Dutch. The time appointed to be for the aſſault, was ſaid to be after harveſt, the manner to be by ſeveral companies entering into the chief men's houſes, by way of trade, and then to kill them in their houſes, and ſeize their arms, and others ſhould be a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> hand to proſecute the maſſacre: This was alſo confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by three Indians that were ſaid to reveal it in the ſame manner, and at the ſame time, to Mr. <hi>Ludlow;</hi> and to the Governor of <hi>New-Haven.</hi> It was added alſo that another Indian ſhould diſcover the ſame plot to Mr. <hi>Haines</hi> of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> by ſome ſpecial circumſtances, viz. that being much hurt by a cart (which uſually there are drawn with oxen) he ſhould ſend for Mr. <hi>Haines</hi> and tell him, that Engliſhman's God was angry with him, and ſent Engliſhman's cow (meaning the oxen in the cart, or wayne) to kill him, becauſe he had concealed a plot againſt the Engliſh, and ſo told him all as the other Indians had done.</p>
            <p>UPON this, their advice from <hi>Connecticut</hi> was, that we ſhould begin with them, and enter upon a war pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, and that if the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> would ſend 120 men to <hi>Saybrook,</hi> at the river's mouth, they would meet them with a proportionable number. This was a very probable ſtory, and very likely it was, that the Indians had been diſcourſing of ſome ſuch buſineſs among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But the General Court of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> when called together, did not think thoſe informations to be a ſufficient ground whereon to begin a war. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Governor and Magiſtrates as many as could convene together before the Court, ordered that all the Indians within their juriſdiction ſhould be diſarmed, which they willingly yielded unto: And upon all the enquiries and examinations which were made by the Court when aſſembled together, they could not find any ſuch violent preſumption of a conſpiracy, as to be the ground of a war. Beſides, it was conſidered, that the reports of all Indians were found by experience to be
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:014120_0042_0F92FF154C0D7300"/>very uncertain, eſpecially when it may well be ſuppoſed, that they are or may be raiſed and carried by ſuch as are at variance one with another; who may be very like to accuſe one another to ingratiate themſelves with the Engliſh. <hi>Miantonimo,</hi> Sachem of <hi>Narrhaganſet,</hi> was ſent unto, and by his readineſs to appear, ſatisfied the Engliſh that he was innocent as to any preſent conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy; though his quarrel with the <hi>Mohegins</hi> (who bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered upon <hi>Connecticut</hi> colony) might very probably, as was judged, render him the ſubject of ſuch a report, or an occaſion of it.</p>
            <p>THE ſaid <hi>Miantonimo</hi> when he came before the Court peremptorily demanded that his accuſers might be bro'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> before him face to face, and if they could not prove it, then to be made to ſuffer, what himſelf if he had been found guilty had deſerved, i. e. death, his reaſons for which were very plauſible. He urged very much the proſecuting ſuch a law againſt his accuſers; alledging, that if the Engliſh did not believe it, why did they diſarm the Indians round about: And if they did believe it, equity required, that they who accuſed him ſhould be puniſhed according to the offence charged upon himſelf. He offered alſo to make it good againſt <hi>Uncas,</hi> Sachem of the <hi>Mohegins,</hi> that the report was raiſed either by him, or ſome of his people. The Engliſh anſwered, that divers Indians had robbed ſome of the Engliſh men's houſes, which might be a ſufficient ground to diſarm; and with that he was ſomething ſatisfied. The <hi>Connecticut</hi> men were hardly prevailed with to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the war againſt them, but at laſt they were overcome with the allegations of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> to lay it aſide.</p>
            <p>MIANTONIMO when he was at <hi>Boſton</hi> was very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate in his anſwers, ſhewing a good underſtanding in the principles of juſtice and equity, as well as a ſeeming ingenuity withal: But though his words were ſmoother than oil, yet, as many conceived, in his heart were drawn ſwords. It was obſerved alſo, that he would never ſpeak but when ſome of his Counſellors were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that they might, as he ſaid, bear witneſs of all his ſpeeches at their return home.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:014120_0043_0F92FF1655E11AD0"/>
THEY ſpent two days in the treaty, wherein at laſt he gave them ſatisfaction in all things, though he held off long about the <hi>Nianticks,</hi> of whom he ſaid they were as his own fleſh, engaging on their behalf, that if they ſhould do any wrong, ſo as neither he nor they could ſatisfy without blood, then he would leave them to the mercy of the Engliſh. At his departure he gave his hand to the Governor, telling him, that was for the Magiſtrates that were abſent.</p>
            <p>WHILE he was at <hi>Boſton</hi> one of his own followers had been a principal evidence againſt him; he how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever promiſed to deliver him to the <hi>Mohegin</hi> Sachem whoſe ſubject he was; notwithſtanding which promiſe, going homeward he cut off his head to prevent his tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more tales. And with great diſcontent as he was going home ſaid he would come no more to <hi>Boſton,</hi> wherein he proved a truer prophet than he himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved when he uttered the words, for in the end of the ſame year, 1643, making war upon <hi>Uncas,</hi> he was taken priſoner by him, and ſoon after by the advice of the Commiſſioners of the four colonies (at that time firmly united into a league offenſive and defenſive, on which account they were after that time called the united co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies of <hi>New-England;</hi> though ſince that time they are reduced to but three colonies; that of <hi>New-Haven</hi> and <hi>Connecticut</hi> by the laſt patent being united in one) his head was cut off by <hi>Uncas,</hi> it being juſtly feared, that there would never be any firm peace, either betwixt the Engliſh and the <hi>Narrhaganſets,</hi> or betwixt the <hi>Narrha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganſets</hi> and the <hi>Mohegins,</hi> while <hi>Miantonimo</hi> was left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live: However, the <hi>Narrhaganſets</hi> have ever ſince that time <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> implacable malice againſt <hi>Uncas,</hi> and all the <hi>Mohegins,</hi> and for their ſakes ſecretly againſt the Engliſh, ſo far as they durſt diſcover it.</p>
            <p>IN the years 1645 and 1646, they grew ſo inſolent, that the Commiſſioners of the united colonies were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to raiſe forces to go againſt them, but when they preceived that the Engliſh were in good earneſt, they began to be afraid, and ſued for peace, and ſubmitted
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:014120_0044_0F92FF16EB8DF6A0"/>to pay tribute to ſatisfy for the charge of preparation for the war, but were always very backward to make pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment until the Engliſh were forced to demand it by new forces, ſo that it appeared they were unwillingly willing to hold any friendly correſpondence with the Engliſh, yet durſt they never make any open attempt upon them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the preſent rebellion, wherein they had no ſmall hand, is too, too evident, notwithſtanding all their pretences to the contrary, as will appear in the ſequel of this hiſtory.</p>
            <p>THUS it is apparent upon what terms the Engliſh ſtood with the <hi>Narrhaganſets,</hi> ever ſince the cutting off <hi>Miantonimo,</hi> their chief Sachem's head by <hi>Uncas,</hi> it being done with the advice and counſel of the Engliſh, <hi>Anno</hi> 1643. As for the reſt of the Indians, ever ſince the ſuppreſſing of the <hi>Pequods</hi> in the year 1637, until the year 1675, there was always in appearance amity and good correſpondence on all ſides, ſcarce an Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was ever known to be aſſaulted or hurt by any of them, until after the year 1671, when the ſon of one <hi>Matoonas,</hi> who as was ſuppoſed, being vexed in his mind that the deſign againſt the Engliſh, intended to begin 1671, did not take place, out of meer malice and ſpite againſt them, ſlew an Engliſhman traveiling along the road, the ſaid <hi>Matoonas</hi> being a <hi>Nipnet</hi> Indian, which <hi>Nipnets</hi> were under the command of the Sachem of <hi>Mount-Hope,</hi> the author of all the preſent miſchiefs.</p>
            <p>UPON a due enquiry into all preceeding tranſactions between the Indians and the Engliſh, from their firſt ſettling in theſe coaſts, there will appear no ground of quarrel that any of them had againſt the Engliſh, nor any provocation upon one account or another; for when <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> colony was firſt planted, within three months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their firſt landing, <hi>March</hi> 16, 1620, <hi>Maſſaſoit,</hi> the chief Sachem of all that ſide of the country, repaired to the Engliſh at <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and entered into a ſolemn league upon ſundry articles, (printed in <hi>New-England</hi>'s Memorial, 1669) which are as follows, viz.</p>
            <p n="1">

1. THAT neither he nor any of his ſhould injure or do hurt to any of their people.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THAT if any of his did any hurt to any of theirs, he ſhould ſend the offender that they might puniſh him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THAT if any thing were taken away from any of theirs, he ſhould cauſe it to be reſtored; and they ſhould do the like to his.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THAT if any did unjuſtly war againſt him, they ſhould aid him, and if any did war againſt them, he ſhould aid them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. THAT he ſhould ſend to his neighbour confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, to certify them of this, that they might not wrong them, but might likewiſe be compriſed in theſe conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of peace.</p>
            <p n="6">6. THAT when his men came to them upon any occaſion, they ſhould leave their arms <hi>(which were then bows and arrows)</hi> behind them.</p>
            <p n="7">7. THAT ſo doing, their ſovereign Lord King JAMES would eſteem him as their friend and ally.</p>
            <p>THIS league the ſame Sachem, <hi>September</hi> 25, 1630, a little before his death, coming with his eldeſt ſon, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward called <hi>Alexander,</hi> did renew with the Engliſh at the Court of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> for himſelf and his ſon, and their heirs and ſucceſſors: And after that he came to Mr. <hi>Brown</hi>'s, who lived not far from <hi>Mount-Hope,</hi> bringing his two ſons, <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> with him, deſiring there might be love and amity after his death, between his ſons and them, as there had been betwixt himſelf and them in former times: Yet it is very remarkable, that this <hi>Maſſaſoit,</hi> called alſo <hi>Wooſamequen</hi> (how much ſoever he affected the Engliſh, yet) was never in the leaſt degree well affected to the religion of the Engliſh, but would in his laſt treaty with his neighbours at <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> when they were with him about purchaſing ſome land at <hi>Swanzey,</hi> have had them engaged never to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to draw away any of his people from their old

               </gap>ever to make any treaty with him more upon that account, which when he diſcerned, he did not further urge it: but that was a bad omen that notwithſtanding whatever his humanity were to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, as they were ſtrangers, (for indeed they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payed his former kindneſs to them, by protecting him afterwards againſt the inſolencies of the <hi>Narrhaganſets</hi>) he manifeſted no ſmall diſplacency of ſpirit againſt them, as they were chriſtians: which ſtrain was evident more in his ſon that ſucceeded him, and all his people, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that ſome diſcerning perſons of that juriſdiction have feared that that nation of Indians would all be root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, as is ſince come to paſs. The like may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved concerning the <hi>Narrhaganſets,</hi> who were always more civil and courteous to the Engliſh than any of the other Indians, tho' never as yet received the leaſt tincture of chriſtian religion, but have in a manner run the ſame fate with their neighbours of <hi>Mount-Hope,</hi> there being very few of them now leſt ſtanding. Nor is it unworthy the relation, what a perſon of quality amongſt us hath of late affirmed, viz.

                  <p>I THINK I can clearly ſay, that before theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent troubles broke out, the Engliſh did not poſſeſs one foot of land in this colony, but what was fairly obtained by honeſt purchaſe of the Indian proprietors: Nay, becauſe ſome of our people are of a covetous diſpoſition, and the Indians are in their ſtraits eaſily prevailed with to part with their lands, we firſt made a law, that none ſhould purchaſe or receive of gift, any land of the Indians without the knowledge and allowance of our Court, and penalty of a fine, five pounds per acre, for all that ſhould be ſo bought or obtained.

And for divers years laſt paſt (that all occaſion of offence in that reſpect might be prevented) the Engliſh agreed with <hi>Philip</hi> and his, for a certain ſum yearly to maintain the ſaid fence, and ſecure themſelves.

            <p>YET did this treacherous and perfidious caitiff ſtill harbour the ſame or more miſchievous thoughts againſt the Engliſh than ever before, and hath been ſince that time plotting with all the Indians round about, to make a general inſurrection againſt the Engliſh in all the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies; which, as ſome priſoners lately brought in have confeſſed, ſhould have been put in execution at once, by all the Indians riſing as one man, againſt all thoſe plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Engliſh, which were next to them. The <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhaganſets</hi> having promiſed, as was confeſſed, to riſe with four thouſand fighting men in the ſpring of this preſent year, 1676. But by the occaſion hereafter to be mentioned about <hi>Sauſaman, Philip</hi> was neceſſitated for the ſafety of his own life to begin his rebellion the year before, when the deſign was not ſully ripe. Yet ſome are ready to think, that if his own life had not now been in
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:014120_0054_0F979A29B249D720"/>jeopardy by the guilt of the murder of the aforeſaid <hi>Sauſaman,</hi> his heart might have failed him, when it ſhould have come to be put in execution, as it did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the year 1671, which made one of his Captains, of far better courage and reſolution than himſelf, when he ſaw his cowardly temper and diſpoſition, fling down his arms, calling him white liver'd cur, or to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and ſaying, that he would never own him again, or fight under him; and from that time hath turned to the Engliſh, and hath continued to this day a faithful and reſolute ſoldier in their quarrel.</p>
            <p>THAT the Indians had a conſpiracy amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to riſe againſt the Engliſh, is confirmed by ſome of the Indians about <hi>Hadley,</hi> although the plot was not come to maturity when <hi>Philip</hi> began, the ſpecial providence of God therein over-ruling the contrivers: For when the beginning of the troubles firſt was report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Mount-Hope,</hi> many of the Indians were in a kind of a maze, not knowing well what to do, ſometimes ready to ſtand for the Engliſh, as formerly they had been wont to do; ſometimes inclining to ſtrike in with <hi>Philip</hi> (which at the laſt they generally did) which if it had been foreſeen, much of that miſchief might have been prevented that fell out in ſeveral places, more by perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and treacherous dealing than any other ways; the Engliſh never imagining that after ſo many obliging kindneſſes received from them by the Indians, beſides their many engagements and proteſtations of friendſhip, as formerly, they would have been ſo ungrateful, perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly falſe and cruel, as they have ſince proved.</p>
            <p>THE occaſion of <hi>Philip</hi>'s ſo ſudden taking up arms the laſt year was this—There was one <hi>John Sauſaman</hi> a very cunning and plauſible Indian well ſkilled in the Engliſh language, and bred up in a profeſſion of the chriſtian religion, employed as a ſchool-maſter at <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> the Indian town, who upon ſome miſdemeanor fled from his place to <hi>Philip,</hi> by whom he was entertained in the room and office of a Secretary, and his chief Counſellor, whom he truſted with all his affairs and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:014120_0055_0F979A2A72AAB400"/>counſels: But afterwards, whether upon the ſting of his own conſcience, or by the frequent ſollicitations of Mr. <hi>Eliot,</hi> that had known him from a child, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed him in the principles of our religion, who was often laying before him the heinous fin of his apoſtacy, and returning back to his old vomit, he was at laſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with to forſake <hi>Philip,</hi> and returned back to the chriſtian Indians at <hi>Natick,</hi> where he was baptized, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting public repentance for all his former offences, and made a ſerious profeſſion of the chriſtian religion: and did apply himſelf to preach to the Indians, wherein he was better gifted than any other of the Indian nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo as he was obſerved to conform more to the Engliſh manners than any other Indian: yet having occaſion to go up with ſome others of his countrymen to <hi>Namaſket;</hi> (now <hi>Middleborough</hi>) whether for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of fiſhing, or ſome ſuch occaſion, it matters not; being there not far from <hi>Philip</hi>'s country, he had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to be much in the company of <hi>Philip</hi>'s Indians, and of <hi>Philip</hi> himſelf; by which means he diſcerned by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral circumſtances, that the Indians were plotting anew againſt us; the which out of faithfulneſs to the Engliſh, the ſaid <hi>Sauſaman</hi> informed the Governor of, adding alſo, that if it were known that he revealed it, he knew they would preſently kill him. There appearing ſo many concurrent teſtimonies from others, making it the more probable, that there was a certain truth in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, ſome enquiry was made into the buſineſs, by examining <hi>Philip</hi> himſelf, and ſeveral of his Indians, who although they would own nothing, yet could not free themſelves from juſt ſuſpicion. <hi>Philip</hi> therefore ſoon after contrived the ſaid <hi>Sauſaman</hi>'s death, which was ſtrangely diſcovered, notwithſtanding it was ſo cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly effected, for they that murdered him met him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ice on a great pond, and preſently after they had knocked him down, put him under the ice, yet leaving his gun and hat upon the ice, that it might be thought he ſell in accidentally through the ice and was drowned: but being miſſed by his friends, who finding his hat and gun, they were thereby led to the place, where his body was found under the ice. When they
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:014120_0056_0F979A2C1241BC90"/>took him up to bury him, ſome of his friends, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly one <hi>David,</hi> obſerved ſome bruiſes about his head, which made them ſuſpect he was firſt knocked down, before he was put into the water, however, they buried him near about the place where he was found, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any further enquiry at preſent: nevertheleſs <hi>David</hi> his friend, reported theſe things to ſome Engliſh at <hi>Taunton</hi> (a town not far from <hi>Namaſket</hi>) which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned the Governor to enquire further into the buſineſs, wiſely conſidering, that as <hi>Sauſaman</hi> had told him, if it were known that he had revealed any of their plots, they would murder him for his pains: wherefore, by ſpecial warrant the body of <hi>Sauſaman</hi> being digged again out of his grave, it was very apparent that he had been kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and not drowned. And by a ſtrange providence, an Indian was found, that by accident ſtanding unſeen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a hill, had ſeen them murdering the ſaid <hi>Sauſaman,</hi> but durſt never reveal it for fear of loſing his own life likewiſe, until he was called to the Court at <hi>Plimouth,</hi> or before the Governor, where he plainly confeſſed what he had ſeen. The murderers being apprehended, were convicted by his undeniable teſtimony, and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable circumſtances, and ſo were all put to death, being three in number; the laſt of them confeſſed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before his death, that his father (one of the Counſellors and ſpecial friends of <hi>Philip</hi>) was one of the two that murdered <hi>Sauſaman,</hi> himſelf only looking on. This was done at <hi>Plimouth</hi> Court, hold in <hi>June,</hi> 1675, inſomuch that <hi>Philip</hi> apprehending the danger his own head was in next, never uſed any further means to clear himſelf from what was like to be laid to his charge, either about his plotting againſt the Engliſh, nor yet about <hi>Sauſaman</hi>'s death; but by keeping his men continually about him in arms, and gathering what ſtrangers he could to join with him, marching up and down conſtantly in arms, both all the while the Court ſat, as well as afterwards. The Engliſh of <hi>Plimouth</hi> hearing of all this, yet took no further notice, than only to order a military watch in all the adjacent towns, hoping that <hi>Philip,</hi> finding himſelf not likely to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned by order of the ſaid Court, the preſent cloud
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:014120_0057_0F979A2CB38FBCD0"/>might blow over, as ſome others of like nature had done before; but in concluſion, the matter proved otherwiſe, for <hi>Philip</hi> finding his ſtrength daily increaſing by the flocking of neighbour Indians unto him, and ſending over their wives and children to the <hi>Narrhaganſets</hi> for ſecurity (as they uſe to do when they intend war with any of their enemies) they immediately began to alarm the Engliſh at <hi>Swanzey</hi> (the next town to <hi>Philip</hi>'s coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try) as it were daring the Engliſh to begin; at laſt their inſolencies grew to ſuch an height, that they began not only to uſe threatening words to the Engliſh, but alſo to kill their cattle and rifle their houſes; whereat an Engliſhman was ſo provoked, that he let fly a gun at an Indian, but did only wound, not kill him; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Indians immediately began to kill all the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh they could, ſo as on the 24th of <hi>June,</hi> 1675, was the alarm of war firſt ſounded in <hi>Plimouth</hi> colony, when eight or nine of the Engliſh were ſlain in and about <hi>Swanzey;</hi> they firſt making a ſhot at a company of Engliſh as they returned from the aſſembly where they were met in a way of humiliation on that day, whereby they killed one and wounded others, and then likewiſe at the ſame time, they ſlew two men on the high-way, ſent to call a ſurgeon; and the ſame day barbarouſly murdered ſix men in and about a dwelling-houſe in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother part of the town; all which outrages were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſo ſuddenly, that the Engliſh had no time to make any reſiſtance: For on the 14th day of the ſame month, beſides endeavors uſed by Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> of <hi>Swan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>en, when things ſeemed to look with as bad a face as they then did. However, the Governor and Council of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> underſtanding that <hi>Philip</hi> continued in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and manifeſted no inclination to peace, they
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:014120_0058_0F979A2D75389A70"/>immediately ſent up what forces they could to ſecure the towns thereabouts, and make reſiſtance as occaſion might be; and alſo diſpatched away meſſengers to the <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts</hi> Governor and Council, letting them know the ſtate of things about <hi>Mount-Hope,</hi> and deſiring their ſpeedy aſſiſtance; upon which care was immediately ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with all expedition to ſend ſuch ſupplies as were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired: But in the mean time two meſſengers were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched to <hi>Philip,</hi> to try whether he could not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from his bloody enterprize, ſo to have prevented the miſchief ſince fallen out, hoping, that as once before, viz. in the year 1671, by their mediation, a ſtop was put to the like tragedy, ſo the preſent war might by the ſame means have been now turned aſide: For in the ſaid year <hi>Philip</hi> had firmly engaged himſelf, when he was at <hi>Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> not to quarrel with <hi>Plimouth</hi> until he had firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed himſelf to the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> for advice and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation: But the two meſſengers aforeſaid, finding the men ſlain in the road <hi>June</hi> 24, as they were going for the ſurgeon, apprehended it not ſafe to proceed any further, conſidering alſo, that a peace now could not honorably be concluded after ſuch barbarous outrages committed upon ſome of the neighbour colony: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore returning with all ſpeed to <hi>Boſton,</hi> the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> forces were diſpatched away with all imaginable haſte, as the exigence of the matter did require, ſome of them being then upon, or ready for their march, the reſt were ordered to follow after, as they could be raiſed. The ſending forth of which, becauſe it was the firſt engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in any warlike preparations againſt the Indians, ſhall be more particularly related.</p>
            <p>ON the 26th of <hi>June,</hi> a foot company under Captain <hi>Daniel Henchman,</hi> with a troop under Captain <hi>Thomas Prentice,</hi> were ſent out of <hi>Boſton</hi> toward <hi>Mount-Hope:</hi> It being late in the afternoon before they began to march, the central eclipſe of the moon in <hi>Capric.</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the evening before they came up to <hi>Naponſet</hi> river, about twenty miles from <hi>Boſton,</hi> which occaſioned them to make a halt, for a little repaſt, till the moon recovered her light again. Some melancholy fancies
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:014120_0059_0F979A2E33F43B60"/>would not be perſwaded, but that the eclipſe falling out at that inſtant of time was ominous, conceiving alſo that in the centre of the moon they diſcerned an unuſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al black ſpot, not a little reſembling the ſcalp of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian: As others not long before, imagined they ſaw the form of an Indian bow, accounting that likewiſe omin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous (although the miſchief following was done by guns, and not by bows) both the one and the other, might rather have thought of what <hi>Marcus Craſſus</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> General, going forth with an army againſt the <hi>Parthians,</hi> once wiſely replied to a private ſoldier, that would have diſſwaded him from marching that time, becauſe of an eclipſe of the moon in <hi>Capricorn, that he was more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of Sagitarius than of Capricornus,</hi> meaning the arrows of the <hi>Parthians</hi> (accounted very good archers) from whom as things then fell out, was his greateſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. But after the moon had waded through the dark ſhadow of the earth, and borrowed her light again, by the help thereof, the two companies marched on toward <hi>Woodcock</hi>'s houſe, thirty miles from <hi>Boſton,</hi> where they arrived next morning; and there retarded their motion till the afternoon, in hope of being overtaken by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of volunteers, under the command of Captain <hi>Samuel Moſely,</hi> which accordingly came to paſs, ſo as on <hi>June</hi> 28th, they all arrived at <hi>Swanzy,</hi> where by the advice of Capt. <hi>Cudworth,</hi> the commander in chief of <hi>Plimouth</hi> forces, they were removed to the head-quarters, which for that time were appointed at Mr. <hi>Miles</hi>'s houſe, the Miniſter of <hi>Swanzy,</hi> within a quarter of a mile of the bridge, leading into <hi>Philip</hi>'s lands. They arriving there ſome little time before night, twelve of the troop unwilling to loſe time paſſed over the bridge, for diſcovery into the enemies territories, where they found the rude welcome of eight or ten Indian, firing upon them out of the buſhes, killing one <hi>William Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> wounding Corporal <hi>Belcher,</hi> his horſe being alſo ſhot down under him; the reſt of the ſaid troopers hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcharged upon thoſe Indians that run away <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="62" facs="unknown:014120_0060_0F979A2EF21F2188"/>night, pitching in a barricado about Mr. <hi>Miles</hi>'s houſe. The enemy thought to have braved it out by a bold aſſault or two at the firſt; but their hearts ſoon began to fail them when they perceived the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> and <hi>Plimouth</hi> forces both engaged againſt them: For the next morning they ſhouted twice or thrice, at half a mile's diſtance, and nine or ten of them ſhewing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on this ſide the bridge, our horſe-men with the whole body of the volunteers under Capt. <hi>Moſely,</hi> not at all daunted by ſuch kind of alarms, nor willing ſo to loſe the bridge, ran violently down upon them over the ſaid bridge, purſuing them a mile and a quarter on the other ſide: Enſign <hi>Savage,</hi> that young martial ſpark, ſcarce twenty years of age, had at that time one bullet lodged in his thigh, another ſhot through the brim of his hat, by ten or twelve of the enemy diſcharging upon him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, while he boldly held up his colours in the front of his company: But the weather not ſuffering any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther action at that time, thoſe that were thus far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, were compelled to retreat back to the main guard, having firſt made a ſhot upon the Indians as they ran away into a ſwamp near by, whereby they killed five or ſix of them, as was underſtood ſoon after at <hi>Narrhaganſet:</hi> This reſolute charge of the Engliſh forces upon the enemy made them quit their place on <hi>Mount-Hope</hi> that very night where <hi>Philip</hi> was never ſeen after; till the next year, when he was by a divine mandate ſent back; there to receive the reward of his wickedneſs where he firſt began his miſchief: The next day Major <hi>Savage</hi> that was to command in chief over the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> forces, being come up with other ſupplies, about ſix o' clock over night the whole body intended to march in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Mount-Hope,</hi> and there beat up the enemy's quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or give him battle, if he durſt abide it: But the weather being doubtful, our forces did not march till near noon, about which time they ſet out, with a troop of horſe in each wing, to prevent the danger of the enemy's ambuſcadoes; after they had marched about a mile and a half, they paſſed by ſome houſes newly burned: Not far off one of them, they found a bible newly torn, and the leaves ſcattered about by the enemy, in hatred of our
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:014120_0061_0F979A2FB2577B50"/>religion therein revealed; two or three miles further they came up with ſome heads, ſcalps, and hands cut off from the bodies of ſome of the Engliſh, and ſtuck upon poles near the highway, in that barbarous and inhuman manner bidding us defiance; the commander in chief giving order that thoſe monuments of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's cruelty ſhould be taken down, and buried: The whole body of the forces ſtill marched on two miles fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where they found divers wigwams of the enemy, among which were many things ſcattered up and down, arguing the haſty flight of the owners; half a mile further, as they paſſed on through many fields of ſtately corn, they found <hi>Philip</hi>'s own wigwam; every place giving them to perceive the enemy's haſty departure from thence; after they had marched two miles further they came to the ſea-ſide, yet in all this time meeting with no Indians, nor any ſign of them, unleſs of their flight to ſome other places. The ſeaſon being like to prove very tempeſtuous, and rainy, Capt. <hi>Cudworth</hi> with ſome of the men of <hi>Plimouth</hi> paſſed over to <hi>Rhode-Iſland.</hi> The forces under Major <hi>Savage</hi> were forced to abide all night in the open field, without any ſhelter, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the abundance of rain that fall, and in the morning, deſpairing to meet with any enemy on <hi>Mount-Hope,</hi> they retreated back to their head-quarters at <hi>Swanzy,</hi> in the way meeting with many Indian dogs, that ſeemed to have loſt their maſters. That night Capt. <hi>Prentice</hi>'s troop for conveniency of quarters, as alſo for diſcovery, was diſmiſſed to lodge at <hi>Seaconke</hi> or <hi>Rehoboth,</hi> a town within ſix miles of <hi>Swanzy.</hi> As they returned back in the morning. Capt. <hi>Prentice</hi> divided his troop, deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one half to Lieut. <hi>Oakes,</hi> and keeping the other himſelf, who as they rode along, eſpied a company of Indians burning an houſe; but could not purſue them by reaſon of ſeveral fences, that they could not go over till the Indians had eſcaped into a ſwamp. Thoſe with Lieut. <hi>Oakes</hi> had the like diſcovery, but with better ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, as to the advantage of the ground, ſo as purſuing of them upon a plain, they flew four or five of them in the chaſe, whereof one was known to be <hi>Thebe</hi> a Sachem of <hi>Mount-Hope,</hi> another of them was a chief Counſellor

After the ſaid troop came up to head-quarters at <hi>Swanzy,</hi> they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood from Capt. <hi>Cadworth</hi> that the enemy were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered upon <hi>Pocaſſet,</hi>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">The main land over againſt the eaſterly end of <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> where is now <hi>Tiverton,</hi> &amp;c. was called <hi>Pocaſſet.</hi>

Capt. <hi>Henchman</hi> and Capt. <hi>Prentice</hi> were ordered to ſearch the ſwamps, while Capt. <hi>Moſely</hi> and Capt. <hi>Paige</hi> with his dragoons attending on Major <hi>Cavage,</hi> ſhould return back into <hi>Mount-Hope,</hi> that they might be ſure to leave none of the enemy behind them, when they ſhould remove to purſue them elſewhere.</p>
            <p>ABOUT ten o'clock the next morning, <hi>July</hi> 4th, Capt. <hi>Henchman,</hi> after a long and tedious march, came to the head-quarters, and informed that he came upon a place where the enemy had newly been that night, but were eſcaped out of his reach: But the following night, before they were determined of any other motion, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> came up from <hi>Boſton</hi> with new orders for them to paſs into <hi>Narrhaganſet,</hi> to treat with the Sachems there, and if it might be, to prevent their joining with <hi>Philip.</hi> Capt. <hi>Cudworth</hi> by this time was come up to the head-quarters, having left a garriſon of 40 men upon <hi>Mount-Hope</hi> neck. The next morning was ſpent in conſultation how to carry on the treaty; it was then reſolved, that they ſhould go to make a peace with a ſword in their hands, having no ſmall ground of ſuſpicion that the ſaid <hi>Narrhaganſets</hi> might join with the enemy, wherefore they thought it neceſſary to carry all the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> forces over into the <hi>Narrhaganſet</hi> country, to fight them if there ſhould be need; Capt. <hi>Moſely</hi> paſſed over by water to attend Capt. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi>

As they paſſed they found the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians in <hi>Pomham</hi>'s country (next adjoining to <hi>Philip</hi>'s borders) all fled, and their wigwams without any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in them.</p>
            <p>AFTER they came to the <hi>Narrhaganſet</hi> Sachems, three or four days were ſpent in a treaty, after which a peace was concluded with them by the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of <hi>Connecticut</hi> colony (who were ordered to meet with thoſe of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi>) and the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the forces ſent againſt <hi>Philip:</hi> Hoſtages were alſo given by the ſaid <hi>Narrhaganſets</hi> for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the agreement.

DURING this treaty of peace with the <hi>Narrhaganſets,</hi> Capt. <hi>Cudworth</hi> with the forces from <hi>Plimouth,</hi> under his command, found ſomething to do nearer home, tho' of another nature as it proved, <hi>ſst.</hi> to make war whilſt the other were (as they thought) making peace: In the firſt place therefore he diſpatched Capt. <hi>Fuller</hi> (joining Lieut. <hi>Church</hi> together with him in commiſſion) with fifty in his company to <hi>Pocaſſet,</hi> on the ſame account, as the other went to <hi>Narrhaganſet;</hi> either to conclude a peace with them, if they would continue friends, and give hoſtages for the confirmation thereof, or fight them if they ſhould declare themſelves enemies, and join with <hi>Philip;</hi> himſelf intending to draw d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>wn his forces to <hi>Rehoboth,</hi> to be ready for a ſpeedy march to <hi>Taunton,</hi> and ſo down into the other ſale of the country, upon the news that ſome of the enemy were burning and ſpoiling of <hi>Middleborough</hi> and <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> two ſmall villages ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the way betwixt <hi>Pocaſſet</hi> and <hi>Plimouth.</hi> Upon Thurſday <hi>July</hi> 7, Capt. <hi>Fuller</hi> with Lieut. <hi>Church</hi> went into <hi>Pocaſſet</hi> to ſeek after the enemy, or elſe as occaſion might ſerve, to treat with thoſe Indians at <hi>Pocaſſet,</hi> with whom Mr. <hi>Church</hi> was very well acquainted, always holding good correſpondence with them. After they had ſpent that day and moſt of the night, in traverſing the ſaid <hi>Pocaſſet</hi> neck, and watching all night in a houſe which they found there, they could hear no tidings of any Indians; inſomuch that Capt. <hi>Fuller</hi> began to be weary of his deſign: Mr. <hi>Church</hi> in the mean while aſſuring him that they ſhould find Indians before it were long: yet for greater expedition they divided their company, Capt. <hi>Fuller</hi> taking down toward the ſea-ſide, where it ſeems, after ſome little ſkirmiſhing with them wherein one man only received a ſmall wound, he either ſaw or heard too many Indians for himſelf and his company to deal with, which made him and them betake themſelves to a houſe near the water-ſide, from whence they were fetched off by a ſloop before night to <hi>Rhode-Iſland.</hi> Capt. <hi>Church</hi> (for ſo he may well be ſtiled after this time) marched further into the neck, imagining that if there were Indians in the neck, they ſhould find them about a peaſe field not far off. As ſoon as they came near the
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:014120_0067_0F979A34F2471BE8"/>ſaid field he eſpied two Indians among the peas, who alſo had at the ſame time eſpied him; and preſently mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome kind of ſhout, a great number of Indians came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the field, purſuing the ſaid Capt. <hi>Church</hi> and his men in great numbers to the ſea ſide: there being not above fifteen with <hi>Church,</hi> yet ſeven or eight ſcore of the Indians purſuing after them. Now was a fit time for this young Captain and his ſmall company to hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel their valour upon this great rout of Indians, juſt ready to devour them: But victory ſtands no more in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſoldiers, than verity in the plurality of voices: And although ſome of theſe fifteen had ſcarce courage enough for themſelves, yet their Captain had enough for himſelf, and ſome to ſpare for his friends, which he there had an opportunity of improving to the full. When he ſaw the hearts of any of his followers to fail, he would bid them be of good courage and fight ſtoutly, and (poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly by ſome divine impreſſion upon his heart) aſſured them not a bullet of the enemy ſhould hurt any one of them; which one of the company, more diſmayed than the reſt, could hardly believe, till he ſaw the proof of it in his own perſon, for the Captain perceiving the man was not able to fight, made him gather rocks together for a kind of ſhelter and baricado for the reſt, that muſt either of neceſſity fight or fall by the enemies. It chanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as this faint-hearted ſoldier had a flat ſtone in his arms, and was carrying it to the ſhelter that he was mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the bank, a bullet of the enemy was thus ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his body, by which he muſt elſe have periſhed, which experience put new life into him, ſo as he follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his buſineſs very manfully afterward, inſomuch that they defended themſelves under a ſmall ſhelter haſtily made up, all that afternoon, not one being either ſlain or wounded, yet it was certainly known that they killed at leaſt fifteen of their enemies: And at the laſt, when they had ſpent all their ammunition, and made their guns unſerviceable by often firing, they were fetched all off by Capt. <hi>Golding</hi>'s ſloop and carried ſafe to <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> in ſpite of all their enemies; yea, ſuch was the bold and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted courage of this champion, Capt. <hi>Church,</hi> that, not willing to leave any token behind of their flying for want
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:014120_0068_0F979A35B243AD00"/>of courage, he went back in the face of his enemies to fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>h his hat, which he had left at a ſpring, whither the extream heat of the weather, and his labor in fighting had cauſed him to repair for the quenching of his thirſt an hour or two before. It ſeems in the former part of the ſame day, five men coming from <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> to look up their cattle upon <hi>Pocaſſet-Neck,</hi> were aſſaulted by the ſame Indians, one of the five was Capt. <hi>Church</hi>'s ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, who had his leg broke in the ſkirmiſh, the reſt hardly eſcaping with their lives: This was the firſt time that ever any miſchief was done by the Indians upon <hi>Pocaſſet-Neck.</hi> Thoſe of <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by alarmed to look to themſelves, as well as the reſt of the Engliſh of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> or the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> colony.</p>
            <p>THIS aſſault rather heightned and increaſed than daunted the courage of Capt. <hi>Church;</hi> for not making a cowardly flight, but a fair retreat, which providence offered him by the ſloop aforeſaid, after his ammunition was ſpent, he did not ſtay long at <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> but haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over to the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> forces, and borrowing three files of men of Capt. <hi>Henchman</hi> with his Lieutenant; Mr. <hi>Church</hi> and he returned again to <hi>Pocaſſet,</hi> where they had another ſkirmiſh with the enemy, wherein ſome few of them (fourteen or fifteen) were ſlain, which ſtruck ſuch a terror into <hi>Philip,</hi> that he betook himſelf to the ſwamps about <hi>Pocaſſet,</hi> where he lay hid till the return of the reſt of the forces from the <hi>Narrhaganſets,</hi> like a wild boar kept at a bay by this ſmall party till more hands came up.</p>
            <p>THUS were the <hi>Plimouth</hi> forces buſied, during the time of the treaty with the <hi>Narrhaganſets,</hi> which being iſſued as it was:</p>

               <hi>Taunton, July</hi> 17, whither after a tedious march of 20 miles they came in the evening, and found the people generally gathered into eight garriſon-houſes.</p>
            <p>ON Monday <hi>July</hi> 18, they marched eighteen miles before they could reach the ſwamp where the enemy was lodged: As ſoon as they came to the place, <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> forces being now joined with them, our ſoldiers reſolutely entered in amongſt the enemies, who took the advantage of the thick under-wood, to make a ſhot at them that firſt entered, whereby five were killed out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, ſeven more wounded, ſome of whoſe wounds proved mortal: After the firſt ſhot, the enemy preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly retired deeper into the ſwamp, deſerting their wigwams (about an 100 in all) newly made of green bark, ſo as they would not burn: In one of them they found an old man, who confeſſed that <hi>Philip</hi> had been lately there. Having ſpent ſome time in ſearching the ſwamp, and tired themſelves to no purpoſe (yet it was ſaid one half hour more would have at that time utterly ſubdued <hi>Philip</hi> and all his power) the commander in chief, night drawing on a pace, not thinking it ſafe to tarry longer in ſo dangerous a place, where every one was in as much danger of his fellows as of his foes, being ready to fire upon every buſh they ſaw move ſuppoſing lndians were there, ordered a retreat to be ſounded, that they might have time to diſpoſe of their dead and wounded men, which accordingly was attended:<note n="*" place="bottom">The Engliſh loſt fifteen men in this expedition, <hi>Hutchinſon.</hi>

It was judged that the enemy being by this means brought into a pound, it would be no hard matter to deal with them, and that it would be needleſs charge to keep ſo many companies of ſoldiers together to wait upon ſuch an inconſiderable enemy, now almoſt as good as taken: Whereupon moſt of the companies belonging to the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> were drawn off, only Capt. <hi>Henchman</hi> with an 100 foot being left there, together with <hi>Plimouth</hi> forces, to attend the enemies motion, being judged ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:014120_0070_0F979A37F3D5BEB0"/>for that end. Major <hi>Savage,</hi> Capt. <hi>Paige</hi> with Capt. <hi>Moſely</hi> and their companies returned to <hi>Boſton:</hi> Capt. <hi>Prentice</hi> with his troop were ordered toward <hi>Mendham,</hi> where it ſeems, about the middle of <hi>July,</hi> ſome Indians, wiſhing well to <hi>Philip</hi>'s deſign, had made an aſſault upon ſome of the inhabitants, as they were at their labor in the field, killing five or fix of them; as ſoon as they had done, flying away into the woods, ſo as they could not eaſily be purſued. The inhabitants of the ſame village, lying in the heart of the enemy's country began to be diſcouraged, ſo as within a little time after they forſook the place, abandoning their houſes to the fury of the enemy, which by them were ſoon after turned into aſhes. But to return to King <hi>Philip,</hi> who was now lodged in the great ſwamp upon <hi>Pocaſſet-Neck,</hi> of ſeven miles long: Capt. <hi>Henchman</hi> and the <hi>Plimouth</hi> forces kept a diligent eye upon the enemy, but were not willing to run into the mire and dirt after them in a dark ſwamp, being taught by late experience how dangerous it is to fight in ſuch diſmal woods, when their eyes were muffled with the leaves, and their arms pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nioned with the thick boughs of the trees, as their feet were continually ſhackled with the roots ſpreading every way in thoſe boggy woods. It is ill fighting with a wild beaſt in his own den. They reſolved therefore to ſtarve them out of the ſwamp, where they knew full well they could not long ſubſiſt: To that end they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to build a fort, as it were to beleaguer the enemy, and prevent his eſcape out of the place, where they thought they had him faſt enough. <hi>Philip</hi> in the mean time was not ignorant of what was doing without, and was ready therein to read his owndoom if he tarried much longer there, he knew he ſhould fall into their hands from whom he could expect no mercy: The caſe being therefore deſperate, he reſolved with an hundred or two of his beſt fighting men to make an eſcape by the water, all paſſages by the land being ſufficiently guarded by the Engliſh forces. The ſwamp where they were lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed being not-far from an arm of the fen, coming up to <hi>Taunton,</hi> they taking the advantage of a low tide, either waded over one night in the end of <hi>July,</hi> or elſe waſted
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:014120_0071_0F979A04D56347E0"/>themſelves over upon ſmall rafts of timber very early before break of day, by which means the greateſt part of his company eſcaped away into the woods, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the <hi>Nipmuck</hi> country, altogether unknown to the Engliſh forces, that lay encamped on the other ſide of the ſwamp. About an 100 or more of the women and children, which were like to be rather burdenſome than ſerviceable, were left behind, who ſoon after reſigned up themſelves to the mercy of the Engliſh. <hi>Philip</hi>'s eſcape thus from <hi>Pocaſſet</hi> could not long be concealed after the day appeared, there being much champaign land thro' which he was to paſs, ſo as being diſcovered to ſome of <hi>Rehoboth,</hi> the inhabitants preſently followed him, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a party of the <hi>Mohegins,</hi> that a little before came to <hi>Boſton,</hi> offering their ſervice againſt <hi>Philip,</hi> and were ſent up into thoſe parts to be ordered by Captain <hi>Henchman,</hi> but before they came to him were eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to go along with any of the Engliſh that were engaged in the purſuit of <hi>Philip.</hi> News alſo thereof was carried to Capt. <hi>Henchman,</hi> who, as ſoon as he could get over with ſix files of men (rowing hard all or moſt part of the day, to get to <hi>Providence</hi>) followed after the enemy. The <hi>Mohegins</hi> with the men of <hi>Rehoboth,</hi> and ſome of <hi>Providence</hi> came upon their rear over night, ſlew about 30 of them, took much plunder from them, without any conſiderable loſs to the Engliſh. Captain <hi>Henchman</hi> came not up to them (purſuing them only by the track) till the ſkirmiſh was over, and having march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 22 miles that day was not well able to go any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that night; on the other hand, the forces that came from <hi>Rehoboth</hi> and that belonged to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> having left their horſes three miles off, could not go back to fetch them without much loſs of time, and therefore looking at it altogether bootleſs to go after them in the morning, returned back the next day, leaving Captain <hi>Henchman</hi> with his ſix files, and the <hi>Mohegins</hi> to purſue the chaſe to <hi>Nipſatchet,</hi> which he did the next morning. Capt. <hi>Henchman,</hi> that he might the better engage the <hi>Mohegins</hi> to march with him 30 miles, gave them half his proviſion, and was himſelf recruited again by the
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:014120_0072_0F979A38B28DC1D8"/>care of Capt. <hi>Edmunds</hi> of <hi>Providence,</hi> and Lieut. <hi>Brown</hi> who brought proviſion after him to the <hi>Nipmuck</hi> forts. Mr. <hi>Newman,</hi> the Miniſter of <hi>Rehoboth,</hi> deſerved not a little commendation for exciting his neighbours and friends to purſue thus far after <hi>Philip,</hi> animating of them by his own example and preſence: But what the reaſon was why <hi>Philip</hi> was followed no further, it is better to ſuſpend, than too critically to enquire. This is now the third time when a good opportunity of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the rebellion of the Indians, was put into the hands of the Engliſh; but time and chance happeneth to all men. ſo that the moſt likely means are often fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated of their deſired end. All human endeavors ſhall arrive at no other ſucceſs, than the counſel of God hath pre-ordained, that no fleſh might glory in their own wiſdom, but give unto God the praiſe of all their ſucceſſes, and quietly bear whatever miſcarriages he hath ordered to befall them. It appears by the iſſue of theſe things, that although this wound was not incurable, yet much more blood muſt be taken away before it could be healed. But by this means <hi>Philip</hi> eſcaped away to the weſtward, kindling the flame of war in all the weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern plantations of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> colony wherever he came, ſo that by this fatal accident, the fire that was in a likely way to be extinguiſhed, as ſoon almoſt as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, did on a ſudden break out through the whole juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts,</hi> both eaſtward and weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, endangering alſo the neighbour colony of <hi>Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut,</hi> which hath alſo ſuffered ſomewhat by the fury of this flame, though not conſiderable to what the other colonies have undergone.</p>
            <p>WHILE things after this manner proceeded in and about the colony of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> the Commiſſioners of the reſt of the colonies were conſulting and adviſing what was to be done for preventing the miſchief threatened from ſpreading any further, fearing (as indeed there was too much cauſe) that although <hi>Philip</hi> only appeared to make the firſt attempt, yet more either already were, or ſoon might be perſuaded to join with him in acting this bloody tragedy.</p>

IF hath been already declared what hath been done for the ſecuring of the <hi>Narrhaganſets,</hi> thoſe that were ſent as meſſengers on that errand, always reported that the elder people were in appearance, not only inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to peace, but ſeemed very deſirous thereof, inſomuch as their two eldeſt Sachems expreſſed much joy when it was concluded; but as ſince hath appeared, all this was but to gain time, and cover their treacherous intents and purpoſes, that they might in the next ſpring fall upon the Engliſh plantations all at once, as ſome priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners lately brought in have owned and confeſſed; nor have any of thoſe Indians with whom the preſent war hath been, ever regarded any agreements of peace made with the Engliſh, further than out of neceſſity and ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh fear they were compelled thereunto, as may be ſeen by the records of the united colonies from the year 1643 to the preſent time, notwithſtanding all their fair pretences; for <hi>Ninigret,</hi> the old Sachem of the <hi>Narrha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganſets,</hi> who alone of all the reſt of that country Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chems diſowned the preſent war, and refuſed to have any hand therein, had threatned, as was proved to his face before the commiſſioners, in the years 1646 and 1647, that they would carry on the war againſt the <hi>Mohegins,</hi> whatever were the mind of the Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and that they would kill the Engliſh cattle, and heap them up as high as their wigwams, and that an Engliſhman ſhould not ſtir out of his doors to piſs, but they would kill him; all which he could not deny, yet this old fox made many promiſes of peace, when the dread of the Engliſh ever ſince the <hi>Pequod</hi> war moved him thereunto; foreſeeing as he is ſaid to have told his neighbours, that they would all be ruined if they made war with the Engliſh, as is ſince come to paſs. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the good hand of God was ſeen in ſo ordering things, that the <hi>Narrhaganſets</hi> were for the preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from breaking out into open hoſtility againſt the Engliſh, at that time when <hi>Philip</hi> began; which if they had then done, according to the eye of reaſon, it would have been very difficult, if poſſible, for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh to have ſaved any of their inland plantations from being deſtroyed. Thus, altho' God hath in his wiſdom
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:014120_0074_0F979A3A31EDBD00"/>ſuffered ſo much of the rage of the heathen to be let looſe againſt his people here, as ſorely to ſcourge them, that by the wrath of men, praiſe might be yielded to his holy name, yet hath he in his abundant goodneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained the remainder that it ſhould not conſume.</p>
            <p>THE next thing in order to be related, is the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that befel the village of <hi>Brookfield,</hi> which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the care that was taken, fell into the hands of the perfidious <hi>Nipnet</hi> Indians, as ſhall here in the next place be declared; only, as we paſs along, to remind the reader in a ſew words, what was the iſſue of Captain <hi>Henchman</hi>'s purſuit of <hi>Philip.</hi> The <hi>Plymouth</hi> forces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returned home, as was ſaid before, Capt. <hi>Henchman</hi> with his ſix files of men, and the <hi>Mohegin</hi> Indians, having continued in the purſuit of <hi>Philip</hi> till they had ſpent all their proviſion, and tired themſelves, yet never coming within ſight of him, the <hi>Mohegin</hi> Indians in their company directed them to <hi>Mendham,</hi> and then leaving them, returned alſo to their own country. Captain <hi>Henchman</hi> in his march toward <hi>Mendham,</hi> or at <hi>Mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> met with Capt. <hi>Moſely</hi> coming up to bring him proviſion, and advertiſing him of what ſucceſs he had met with in the purſuit, they altered their courſe, for Capt. <hi>Henchman</hi> was ſent down to the Governor and Council, to know what they ſhould do: They preſently remanded him to <hi>Pocaſſet,</hi> and ordered him to ſtay there if there was need, or elſe to draw off, ſurrendering the fort he had been building to <hi>Plimouth</hi> forces, which laſt was choſen by thoſe of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> whereupon Capt. <hi>Hench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> returning to <hi>Boſton,</hi> was ordered to diſband his men. Capt. <hi>Moſely</hi> was ordered to march to <hi>Quabaog</hi> or <hi>Brook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> where he continued a while, with the other Captains ſent up for the relief of the people there, and to ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the enemy in thoſe woods; but after ſome time ſpent in ranging the country thereabouts, not meeting with any of the infidels, he with his company came downwards, ſearching the woods betwixt <hi>Lancaſter</hi> (where a man and his wife with two children were ſlain on Lord's-day, <hi>Aug.</hi> 22) and <hi>Marlborough,</hi> where alſo a lad keeping ſheep was ſhot at by an Indian that wore a
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:014120_0075_0F979A3AF2684C00"/>ſign, as if he had been a friend: the Indian was ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to belong to the <hi>Haſſanemeſit</hi> Indians, at that time confined to <hi>Marlborough,</hi> where they had liberty to dwell in a kind of a fort. The next day the inhabitants ſent to demand their guns, Capt. <hi>Moſely</hi> acquainted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, marched to the fort and found much ſuſpicion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt eleven of them, for ſinging and dancing, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bullets and ſlugs, and much powder hid in their baſkets; inſomuch that eleven of them were ſent down priſoners to <hi>Boſton,</hi> upon ſuſpicion that they had an hand in killing the four at <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and ſhooting at the <hi>Marlborough</hi> ſhepherd: But upon tryal, the ſaid pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners were all of them acquitted of the fact, and were either releaſed, or elſe were with others of that fort, ſent for better ſecurity, and for preventing future trouble in the like kind to ſome of the iſlands below <hi>Boſton</hi> toward <hi>Nantoſket.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ABOUT this time Capt. <hi>Moſely</hi> was ſent with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of ſoldiers to ſome Indian plantations up <hi>Merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack</hi> river, as high as <hi>Pennycook,</hi> but they found no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians there; thoſe that belonged to the place having withdrawn themſelves from their native place, that they might not meddle in the preſent quarrel, as is confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believed that <hi>Woonalonſet</hi> the Sachem of that country had ſo reſolved. That coaſt being clear of the enemies, Capt. <hi>Moſely</hi> ſoon after was ſent up with his men to the towns weſtward about <hi>Hadley,</hi> if it might be, to ſubdue the enemy, who a little before, and at that time, was doing all the miſchief he could in thoſe weſtern planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, both by fire and ſword.</p>
            <p>BUT to return and purſue the rebellious Indians, and keep pace with them in our hiſtory, though our forces as yet could never overtake them in the woods. The Governor and Council of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> were ſenſible of as much danger from the <hi>Nipnet</hi> Indians, as from the former; they being the inland part of the country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ſea coaſt and <hi>Connecticut</hi> river weſtward, and the towns about the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay</hi> eaſtward, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon

The meſſenger that was ſent thi her, brought word back that they found the ſaid Indians wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering; the young men very ſurly and inſolent, the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ones ſhewing ſome inclination to maintain the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted peace. Soon after, <hi>July</hi> 28, 1675. Capt. <hi>Wheeler</hi> was ſent to aſſiſt Capt. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> with a party of 20 horſe to treat further about the peace, who going firſt to <hi>Quabaog</hi> or <hi>Brookfield,</hi> (a town ſituate about 60 or 70 miles from <hi>Boſton,</hi> in the road of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> lying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 25 miles from the ſaid river, and not far diſtant from the chief ſeat of the <hi>Nipnet</hi> Indians) the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the ſaid <hi>Brookfield</hi> had been ſo deluded by thoſe treacherous villains, that fearing no danger, they obtained of thoſe <hi>Nipnets,</hi> the promiſe of a treaty upon the 2d of <hi>Auguſt;</hi> whereupon ſome of the chief of the town rode along unarmed with the ſaid <hi>Wheeler</hi> and <hi>Hutchinſon,</hi> with their party of horſe until they came to the place appointed; but finding no Indians, ſo ſecure were they, that they ventured along further, to find the infidels at their chief town, never ſuſpecting the leaſt danger, but when they had rode four or five miles that way, they fell into an ambuſh, of two or three hundred Indians, ſaid in ſuch a narrow paſſage, betwixt a ſteep hill on the one hand, and an hideous ſwamp on the other, that it was ſcarce poſſible for any of them to
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:014120_0077_0F979A3D53C5B4E0"/>eſcape, eight of them being ſhot down upon the place (whereof three were of <hi>Brookfield</hi>) and three mortally wounded, whereof Capt. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> was one; Capt. <hi>Wheeler</hi> alſo was near loſing his life, whoſe horſe was ſhot down under him, and himſelf ſhot through the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſo that all manner of hopes to eſcape had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from him, had it not been for his ſon, who was (by God's good providence) near or next unto him, this ſon, being a man of undaunted courage, (notwithſtanding his own arm was broken with a bullet) with great nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs and agility of body, diſmounted himſelf, and ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mounted his father upon his own horſe, himſelf getting upon another, whoſe maſter was killed, by which means they both eſcaped, and were afterwards cured. Much ado had thoſe that were left alive to recover <hi>Brookfield,</hi> which in all probability they never had done (the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon road being way laid with Indians on every ſide as was afterwards known) had it not been for one well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with thoſe woods, who led them in a by path, by which means they got thither a little before the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, who quickly came flocking into the town, with full intent to deſtroy it with fire and ſword. But by ſpecial providence the inhabitants were all gathered to the principal houſe of the village (there being ſcarce zo in the town) before the barbarous miſcreants came upon them, immediately ſetting fire upon all the dwelling houſes, with moſt of the other buildings in the town, ſave that one into which the inhabitants were retired, the which they ſeveral times attempted to burn, but were almoſt miraculouſly defeated of their purpoſe by the immediate hand of God. In the mount of the Lord it ſhall be ſeen. For when they had for two days aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted that poor handful of helpleſs people, both night and day pouring in ſhot upon them inceſſantly with guns, and alſo thruſting poles with fire brands, and rags dipt in brimſtone tyed to the ends of them to fire the houſe; at laſt they uſed this deviliſh ſtratagem, to fill a cart with hemp, flux and other combuſtible matter, and ſo thruſting it backward with poles ſpliced together a great length, after they had kindled it; but as ſoon as it had begun to take fire, a ſtorm of rain unexpectedly
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:014120_0078_0F979A3DF5DE0618"/>falling, put out the fire, or elſe all the poor people, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 70 ſouls, would either have been conſumed by mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs flames, or elſe have fallen into the hands of their cruel enemies, like wolves continually yelling and gap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their prey.</p>
            <p>THUS was that diſtreſſed company ſtrangely deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who have for ever cauſe to ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord, who hath not given us a prey to their teeth, our ſoul is eſcaped as a bird out of the ſnare of the fowlers, the ſnare is broken and we are eſcaped.</hi> For the next night Major <hi>Willard,</hi> by accident hearing of the danger the people were in, came with forty eight dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons to their relief. The occaſion which brought Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor <hi>Willard,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Parker</hi> of <hi>Groton</hi> with forty-ſix more, ſo timely to their relief was this; Major <hi>Willard</hi> in purſuance of his commiſſion from the Governor and Council, was upon Wedneſday <hi>Auguſt</hi> 4th, in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, marching out after ſome Indians to the weſtward, to ſecure them: juſt as they were ſetting forth, ſome of <hi>Marlborough,</hi> who had intelligence (by thoſe that were going to <hi>Connecticut,</hi> and forced to return) what diſtreſs <hi>Brookfield</hi> was in, and knowing of Major <hi>Willard</hi>'s pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to go out that morning from <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> ſent a poſt to acquaint him therewith, which though it did not find him in the town, yet overtook him before he had gone above four or five miles from the place: whereupon, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it more needful to ſuccour <hi>Brookfield</hi> in ſo eminent danger, than to proceed further upon his intended deſign, he altered his courſe and marched directly thither, being about 30 miles diſtant when the tidings were brought him; ſo he arrived there that night very ſeaſonably, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an hour after it was dark, or elſe in probability they had all periſhed before the relief ſent up from <hi>Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> could have reached them, which was not till three days after. The providence of God likewiſe in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſaid Major ſo ſafely, as well as ſeaſonably to their relief, was very remarkable: For the Indians had ſubtilly contrived to cut off all relief ſent, before it could come at them, by laying ambuſhes, and placing their ſcouts at two or three miles diſtance round the town:
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:014120_0079_0F979A3EB4E3A858"/>About an hundred of them were lodged at an houſe not far off in the way toward <hi>Boſton,</hi> to cut off any ſuccour that might come from thence: but it is ſuppoſed they were ſo intenſe upon the project they were about for fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the houſe, concluding it would without fail take place, that either they did not mind their buſineſs of watching, or made ſuch a noiſe for joy thereof, that they did not hear their centinels when they ſhot off their guns, at two miles diſtance. It is ſaid that another party of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians let the Major and his company purpoſely paſs by them, without any oppoſition, waiting for the blow to be given at their firſt approach near the houſe, purpoſing then to have themſelves fallen upon their rear, and ſo to have cut them all off, before the beſieged underſtood any thing thereof. But it pleaſed God ſo to order things in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that no notice was taken of them by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers, nor were they at all diſcerned by them, till they had made themſelves known to their friends; and were admitted within the court of guard; which when the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy had notice of, they poured in their ſhot abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon them; but they were now ſheltered from the danger thereof; only it ſeems their horſes were expoſed to their fury, as many of them were maimed and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as were moſt of the cattle belonging to the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the place ſoon after. This honored perſon, Major <hi>Willard,</hi> continued at <hi>Brookfield,</hi> after this famous exploit for the preſervation of the poor beſieged there, divers weeks, to order ſuch compani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s as were ſent up that way for the ſecuring the plantations on that ſide of the country; and not long after he went himſelf alſo to <hi>Hadley</hi> upon the like ſervice of the country in the preſent war: but after ſome time ſpent in thoſe parts, he returned back to his own place, to order the affairs of his own regiment, much needing his preſence, and leaving the forces about <hi>Hadley</hi> under the command of the Major of that regiment.</p>
            <p>BUT to return to what was in hand before. After the Indians underſtood that ſuccours were come in to the beſieged, they fired all that they had left ſtanding for their own ſhelter while they had beſieged the place
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:014120_0080_0F979A3F74B46A98"/>before mentioned, and ran all away into their own dens, in the neighbouring woods: however it was confeſſed by one of themſelves, that the enemy had 80 of their men killed and wounded in this buſineſs. But are we paſs any further in purſuit of the hiſtory of theſe matters, it will not be amiſs to let the reader underſtand the horrible perfidious and treacherous dealing of theſe <hi>Nipnet</hi> Indians, who, although of all other they had the leaſt reaſon as to any pretence of injury, yet did moſt deceitfully and barbarouſly join with <hi>Philip</hi> and his Indians, after they had been ſeveral times ſent unto by the Governor and Council of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts,</hi> by the advice of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> to have prevented their riſing, as well as the riſing of the <hi>Narrhaganſets,</hi> and alſo had faithfully promiſed not to meddle in the quarrel, as may more fully appear by the engagement under the hands of their Sachems, ſome time before Capt. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> and Capt. <hi>Wheeler</hi> were ſent up to them, which by reaſon of the haſte and unſkilfulneſs of the meſſengers on that behalf ſent, is not ſo fit for public view: but the account of it from their return, was under their hand and oath, <hi>July</hi> 24, 1675, when Lieut. <hi>Ephraim Curtice</hi> ſpake with five of the <hi>Nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> Sachems, four too many to govern ſo ſmall a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but lying upon the head of the principal Indian territories, they were divided into ſo many ſmall parties, two of whom, viz. <hi>Sam,</hi> Sachem of <hi>Weſhacum,</hi> and <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taump</hi> were executed together afterward at <hi>Boſton.</hi> All of them did at that time ſolemnly renew their covenant and promiſe under their hands to come to <hi>Boſton</hi> to ſpeak further with the Governor, inſtead of which, what they perfidiouſly did againſt Capt. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> and others, hath already been declared.</p>
            <p>UPON the report of this ſad diſaſter that befel the inhabitants of <hi>Brookfield,</hi> forces were ſent up under the command of Capt. <hi>Lothrop</hi> and others, to purſue after thoſe Indians, harbouring about thoſe places, and if it might be, to prevent them from joining with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians upon <hi>Connecticut</hi> river, who as yet had not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered themſelves as willing to eſpouſe <hi>Philip</hi>'s intereſt, hut rather made ſome ſemblance to the contrary. There
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:014120_0081_0F979A4034BC84D0"/>was much time ſpent by Major <hi>Willard,</hi> and ſeveral companies of ſoldiers left under his command, about the <hi>Nipnet</hi> country, but all to no purpoſe, for partly by the treachery of ſome of the Indians that came to their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, that ſeemed to favor the Engliſh, but rather acted in behalf of the enemy, partly by the ſubtleties of the enemies themſelves, who could eaſily by their ſcouts diſcern the approach of our ſoldiers, and by the nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their feet eſcape them, our ſoldiers could never meet with any of them, but only by that means driving them further weſtward, they gathered all the Indians they could to their party about <hi>Pecomptuck,</hi> alias <hi>Deer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, Swamſcot,</hi> and <hi>Squakeag,</hi> where were ſome planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Engliſh newly began, whom they aſſaulted in the next place, and did what miſchief they could up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
            <p>IT is here to be noted, that although that worthy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triot and experienced ſoldier, Major <hi>Willard,</hi> hearing of the diſtreſs of <hi>Brookfield</hi> by ſome that were travelling to <hi>Connecticut,</hi> was the firſt that relieved the diſtreſſed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Quabaog</hi> or <hi>Brookfield,</hi> yet Major <hi>Pynchon</hi> of <hi>Springfield</hi> alſo by accident hearing of their calamity, had not only ſent word thereof to <hi>Hartford,</hi> (from whom he received a ſupply of 25 or 30 ſoldiers under Capt. <hi>Wats)</hi> but did alſo ſend a band of men under Lieut. <hi>Cooper,</hi> (afterwards villainouſly ſlain by <hi>Springfield</hi> Indians) who with thoſe ſent from <hi>Hartford,</hi> and ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians belonging to <hi>Springfield</hi> (ſeemingly forward to help the Engliſh) made up fourſcore or thereabouts: theſe marched down to <hi>Brookfield</hi> the ſame day that Capt. <hi>Lothrop</hi> and Capt. <hi>Beers</hi> came up from the <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts,</hi> who having ſpent ſome time in ſearching the woods about <hi>Springfield,</hi> and finding none of the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, did the next day march up to a place called <hi>Memi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimiſſet</hi> by the Indians, where Capt. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> and Capt. <hi>Wheeler</hi> were aſſaulted, and finding no ſign of any Indians amongſt thoſe woods and ſwamps, the company that came from <hi>Springfield,</hi> left the other ſoldiers (who returned to their quarters at <hi>Brookfield)</hi> and went up themſelves further northward at leaſt 20 miles from the
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:014120_0082_0F979A40F6DC8E40"/>ſaid <hi>Brookfield,</hi> and finding no track of Indians in all thoſe woods, they returned back to <hi>Springfield,</hi> leaving enough to defend the people of <hi>Brookfield,</hi> and the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon there.</p>
            <p>BY this it appears, that the Indians by this occaſion were driven more weſtward into the woods between <hi>Hadley</hi> and <hi>Squakbeag,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">

Some think the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh failed in point of prudence, not managing that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs ſo warily as they might, which if they had done, their defection had been prevented, but it is moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that <hi>Philip</hi> had hired them to own his quarrel, by

About two or three days after they fell upon <hi>Squakeag,</hi> another new plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, fifteen miles higher up the river, above <hi>Deer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> where they killed nine or ten of the people, the reſt hardly eſcaped into the garriſon houſe.</p>
            <p>The next day, this diſaſter not being known, Capt. <hi>Beers,</hi> for fear of the worſt, with 36 men, was ſent up to the ſaid <hi>Squakeag,</hi> with ſupplies both of men and proviſion to ſecure the ſmall garriſon there, but before they came very near to the town, they were ſet upon by many hundreds of Indians out of the buſhes by a ſwamp ſide. By this ſudden ſurprizal Capt. <hi>Beers</hi> (who was known to fight valiantly to the very laſt) with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 20 of his men, were ſlain, the reſt flying back to <hi>Hadley.</hi> Here the barbarous villians ſhewed their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent rage and cruelty, more than ever before, cutting off the heads of ſome of the ſlain, and fixing them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on poles near the highway, and not only ſo, but one (if not more) was found with a chain hooked into his under jaw, and ſo hung up on the bough of a tree, ('tis ſeared he was hung up alive) by which means they thought to daunt and diſcourage any that might come
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:014120_0084_0F979A434B427240"/>to their relief, and alſo to terrify thoſe that ſhould be ſpectators with the beholding ſo ſad an object: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that Major <hi>Treat</hi> with his company, going up two days after to fetch off the reſidue of the garriſon, were ſolemnly affected with that doleful ſight, which made them make the more haſte to bring down the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, not waiting for any opportunity to take revenge upon the enemy, having but an 100 with him, too ſew for ſuch a purpoſe. Capt. <hi>Appleton</hi> going up after him, met him coming down, and would willingly have perſuaded them to have turned back, to ſee if they could have made any ſpoil upon the enemy, but the greateſt part adviſed to the contrary, ſo that they were all forced to return with what they could carry away, leaving the reſt for a booty to the enemy, who ſhall are long pay a ſad reckoning for their robberies and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in the time appointed: But the ſufferings of the Engliſh were not as yet come to their height, for after they were come to <hi>Hadley,</hi> the commander in chief taking counſel with the officers of the ſoldiers, ordered them that were then preſent to garriſon the towns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout; ſome to be at <hi>Northampton, Hatfield</hi> and <hi>Deer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> and ſome to remain at <hi>Hadley,</hi> where were the head-quarters of the Engliſh.

               </gap>m at him, while he can level but at one of his enemies at a time: Which groſs miſtake of his, was the ruin of a choice company of young men, the very flower of the county of <hi>Eſſex.</hi> all culled out of the towns belonging to that county, none of which were aſhamed to ſpeak with the enemy in the gate; their dear relations at home mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them, like <hi>Rachel</hi> for her children, and would not be comforted, not only becauſe they were not, but becauſe they were ſo miſerably loſt. The like miſtake was conceived to be the reaſon of the loſs of the former perſons ſlain with the ſaid <hi>Lothrop,</hi> purſuing the Indians that ran away from <hi>Hadley,</hi> and of the 20 ſlain with Capt. <hi>Beers</hi>'s men, who betook themſelves at firſt to the trees, and at the laſt a few got to their horſes ſoon after their Captain was ſhot down. For had he order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his men to march in a body, as ſome of his follow-commanders adviſed, either backward or forward, in reaſon they had not loſt a quarter of the number of them that fell that day by the edge of the ſword. For the Indians, notwithſtanding their ſubtilty and cruelty, durſt not look an Engliſhman in the face in the open field, nor ever yet were known to kill any man with their guns, unleſs when they could lie in wait for him in an ambuſh, or behind ſome ſhelter, taking aim un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcovered, ſo that although it was judged by thoſe that eſcaped, that there were 7 or 800 Indians at leaſt that encountred that company of 80 Engliſh, yet if
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:014120_0086_0F979A44B2416EC8"/>they had kept together in a body, and fought march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they might have eſcaped the numbers of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, with little loſs in compariſon of what they ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For the valiant and ſucceſsful Capt. <hi>Moſely,</hi> and his Lieutenant, coming (though too late) to their reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue, marched through and through that great body of Indians, and yet came off with little or no loſs in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the other. And having fought all thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians for five or ſix hours upon a march, loſt not above two men all that while. nor received other damage ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that 8 or 9 were wounded, who were carried to their quarters at night at <hi>Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>OTHER relief alſo was ſeaſonably ſent in, viz. a company of Engliſh and <hi>Mohegin</hi> or <hi>Pequod</hi> Indians un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of Major <hi>Treat,</hi> who was in the morning marching another way, viz. up toward <hi>Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keag</hi> to ſeek after the enemy that way, with about 100 ſoldiers, Indians and Engliſh, upon whoſe approach the enemy, pretty well acquainted by this laſt encounter with the valour of the Engliſh, immediately went clear away, giving Major <hi>Treat</hi> and Capt. <hi>Moſely,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Deerfield</hi> that night, an opportunity to bury the ſlain the next day. As Capt. <hi>Moſely</hi> came upon the Indians in the morning, he found them ſtripping of the ſlain, amongſt whom was one <hi>Robert Dutch</hi> of <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> having been ſorely wounded by a bullet that raſed to his ſkull, and then mauled by the Indian-hatchets, was left for dead by the ſavages, and ſtrip't by them of all but his ſkin, yet when Capt. <hi>Moſely</hi> came near, be almoſt miraculouſly as one raiſed from the dead, came towards the Engliſh, to their no ſmall amazement, by whom being received and cloathed, he was carried off to the next garriſon, and is living and is in perfect health at this day. May he be to the
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:014120_0087_0F979A4572A56888"/>friends and relations of the reſt of the ſlain, an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of their more perfect reſurrection at the laſt day, to receive their crowns among the reſt of the martyrs that have laid down or ventured their lives, as a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the truth of their religion, as well as love to their country.</p>
            <p>THIS ſore defeat of Capt. <hi>Lothrop</hi> and his men, was the more to be lamented, in that (falling out ſo ſoon after two other of the like nature) it ſo emboldened the enemy, that they durſt ſoon after adventure upon conſiderable towns, though well garriſoned with ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and gave them occaſion of the moſt inſolent braving the garriſon at <hi>Deerfield</hi> the next day, hanging up the garments of the Engliſh in ſight of the ſoldiers, yet on the other ſide of the river. However, it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God, who is always wont to remember his people in their low eſtate, to put ſuch a reſtraint upon them, that when they paſſed very near the garriſon-houſe at <hi>Deerfield,</hi> (wherein where not left above 27 ſoldiers) their Captain uſing this ſtratagem, to cauſe his trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet to ſound as if he had another troop near by to be called together, they turned another way and made no attempt upon the houſe where that ſmall number was, which if they had done with any ordinary reſolution, ſo ſmall a handful of men could hardly have withſtood the force of ſo many hundreds as were then gathered together.</p>
            <p>WHAT loſs the enemy ſuſtained by the reſiſtance of Capt. <hi>Lothrop</hi> and his men, (who no doubt being all reſolute young men, and ſeeing they ſhould be forced by the hard law of the ſword to forego their liver, held them at as high a rate as they could) is not certainly known. It hath ſince been confeſſed by ſome of the Indians themſelves, that they loſt 96 of their man that day.

Where <hi>Philip</hi> did beſtow himſelf in the winter ſeaſon is not ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, ſome ſay that he repaired further weſtward, to try his fortune with thoſe Indians that lie towards <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany,</hi> near the <hi>Dutch</hi> river: Others more probably conceive that he lay hid in ſome part of the <hi>Narrha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganſet</hi> country; for though he was not certainly known to be about the fort at <hi>Narrhaganſet,</hi> when it was taken by our forces in the winter, yet as ſoon as ever they were driven out of the country in <hi>February,</hi> he was found amongſt them that did the miſchief at <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter</hi> in that month.</p>
            <p>SOME ſtragling parties of them remained about <hi>North-Hampton, Weſtfield</hi> and <hi>Springfield</hi> ſome time after their defeat at <hi>Hatfield:</hi> Seven or eight of the inhabitants of <hi>North-Hampton</hi> in the end of <hi>October,</hi> venturing to fetch in ſome of their harveſt, that was leſt ſomewhere out of town, were in danger of being ſurpriſed, having laid their arms under their cart, ſo as being deſtitute of means to make their defence, they were glad to fly away with the horſes out of their carts, leaving what they were about to the pleaſure of the Indians that aſſaulted them. Major <hi>Treat</hi> upon hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:014120_0093_0F979A4AB21E6220"/>the alarm, preſently repaired thither, but could not come time enough to deſtroy any of the enemy, nor yet to prevent their burning of four or five houſes, with two or three barns that ſtood ſomewhat out of the town. Within a little time after they killed three of the ſame town, as they were at work in a meadow not far from the town: They intended alſo to have burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the mill, but it was too well guarded by two files of muſketiers lodged there for the purpoſe, who put them beſide their intent. Six or ſeven of <hi>Springfield</hi> ſoon after going to the mill at <hi>Weſtfield</hi> (that which belonged to their own town being burned <hi>October</hi> 5th) and venturing without arms, three of them were killed by ſome of the enemy, who took the advantage alſo to burn four or five houſes that belonged to the ſaid <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field:</hi> But by the end of <hi>November</hi> the coaſt was pretty clear of them, unleſs ſome few of them that lay lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſwamps thereabouts all the winter, doing ſome ſmall miſchief upon ſome out-dwellings of <hi>Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field.</hi>

            <p>NOVEMBER 1ſt, 1675, Capt. <hi>Henchman</hi> marched out of <hi>Boſton,</hi> inter ding to viſit the Indians about <hi>Haſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemeſit:</hi> The third day they ſaw ſome fires of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, yet could not meet with them that made them:
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:014120_0094_0F979A4B71CE55F0"/>The 4th day they marched to ſome part of the Indian plantations called <hi>Haſſanemeſit:</hi> The Captain would have taken up his quarters a mile on this ſide, but ſome of his officers over-ruled him, to whoſe impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity he gave way, and marched a mile further to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the enemy, and by that means ſaved the miller's youth, taken the week before from <hi>Marlborough;</hi> for in the morning very early, as the ſcouts were looking out, they ſpyed a wigwam, where ſome Indians that had carried away the youth, had lodged all night, or in ſome wigwam near by. When the Indians ſaw our ſoldiers, they haſted away, and left the <hi>Marlborough</hi> youth behind them, who by that means eſcaped their hands. Our men under Capt. <hi>Henchman</hi> marched on to <hi>Poppachuog,</hi> and finding the Indians all fled, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they perceived by a meſſenger accidentally ſent back, that the Indians followed them all that way they marched) they came back to <hi>Mendham</hi> to ſettle things in that town. Some of the inhabitants informed them of ſome Indian wigwams about ten miles off: The Captain with <hi>Philip Curtice,</hi> his Lieutenant, reſolved to give them a camiſado in their wigwams that night: To that and they mounted 22 upon horſes, riding up ten miles into the woods, and when they came rear the wigwams, they diſmounted, and intended pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to march up, and give an aſſau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t upon them, after they had firſt made a ſhout to fright the enemy: They ordered one half to follow the Lieutenant, the other to follow the Captain, when they came within a quarter of a mile of the place, their dogs began to bark, at which they ſtop'd, and by marching again, intended preſently to fire in upon them, but the Captain's foot ſlipping, he could hardly recover himſelf, when ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly looking behind him, he ſay, no man following of him: The Lieutenant had five behind him, who with thoſe five reſolutely filed on that ſide he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to make the aſſault upon; but they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed by the Indians, who firing out of their dens, ſhot down the Lieutenant and another, the reſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ran away to a fence: The Captain with all ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency urged them to ſtay, they replied, they went

               </gap>, ſo ſad a loſs befel the company, as could not eaſily he repaired: However, the enemy preſently deſerted the wigwam and gave our men the next day an opporu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to fetch off their two dead men, and bury them, and ſo with grief and ſhame were conſtrained to return to their quarters at <hi>Mendham,</hi> to whoſe inhabitants they gave notice of 200 buſhels of corn belonging to the Indians, that might have been preſerved, which for want of hands was loſt by the fire, that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my might not be benefited thereby. It appears by the foregoing paſſage, that the time of our deliverance was not yet come, and that God had further <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ials to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint us with before he would turn his hand upon our enemies. But it pleaſed the Lord in mercy ſo to order things, that they themſelves fell into that pit they were digging for others, as ſhall appear more fully in what follows.</p>
            <p>THE Engliſh plantations about <hi>Hadley</hi> being for the preſent ſet a little at liberty by the Indians drawing off, like ſeamen after a ſtorm, counted it their beſt courſe to repair their tackling againſt another that may be next coming, wherefore the inhabitants concluded it the ſafer way to make a kind of barricado about their towns, by ſetting up pallizadoes or cleft wood, about eight foot long, as it were to break the force of any ſudden aſſault which the Indians might make upon them; which counſel proved very ſucceſsful; for although it be an inconſiderable defence againſt a warlike enemy, that hath ſtrength enough, and confidence to beſiege a place, yet it is ſufficient to prevent any ſudden aſſault of ſuch a timorous and barbarous enemy as theſe were, for although they did afterwards in the ſpring break through thoſe pallizadoes at <hi>North Hampton,</hi> yet as ſoon as ever they began to be repulſed, they ſaw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves like wolves in a pound, that they could not fly away at their pleaſure, ſo as they never adventured to break through afterward upon any of the towns ſo ſecured.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="unknown:014120_0096_0F979A4CF1BBA4C8"/>
AS for thoſe of <hi>Springfield</hi> they were now and then alarmed with a few ſkulking Indians lurking about in the adjacent woods; as once at the <hi>Long Meadow,</hi> where half a ſcore of them were ſeen about an houſe remote from the town, who were purſued by a party of the Engliſh toward <hi>Windſor,</hi> and ſo eſcaped, after the Engliſh had made one ſhot upon them, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certainly how many they killed. So at another time, a ſew of thoſe barbarous wretches killed a poor man belonging to <hi>Springfield,</hi> as he was going to his houſe to look after his corn, on the other ſide of the river, and after they had killed the man, they burnt down his houſe; yet attempted no further miſchief upon that part of the town that had eſcaped the fury of the flames, <hi>October</hi> 5. By which it is evident, that all the number of Indians that had aſſaulted them before, had withdrawn themſelves now to their winter quarters, ſome to the <hi>Dutch River,</hi> but the greateſt number of them to beſure were found in the winter at the <hi>Narrhaganſet</hi> fort, where we ſhall leave them for the preſent till the forces of the united colonies ſhall fire them out of their neſts.</p>
            <p>THE ſoldiers continuing ſome time at <hi>Hatfield</hi> after this victory, as we may well call it (for it ſeems to have given the firſt check to the rage of the heathen within the juriſdiction of the united colonies, they have been obſerved ever ſince to have been on the looſing hand, ſeldom or ever daring to meet our ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in the open field, unleſs when they have very great advantage as to their numbers, or covert of the woods and buſhes: Although like ſome ranging beaſts they have done much miſchief ſeveral times ſince, when they were ready to expire, or when the pangs of death were coming upon them) our forces were all called home, ſave ſome left for garriſoning the towns thereabouts.</p>
            <p>THE Commiſſioners of the united colonies taking into ſerious conſideration the preſent ſtate of things, viz. that there were before this time ſo many hundreds
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:014120_0097_0F979A4DB1C7F520"/>gathered together into one body, and that there was great reaſon to fear, if they were let alone till the next ſpring they might all riſe together as one man round about us, and that one town after another might eaſily be deſtroyed, before any help could be diſpatched to them. On the one hand, the ſharpneſs of the winter in theſe parts was well weighed, ſo extream that it might hazard the loſs of a thouſand men in one night, if they were forced to lodge abroad in the open field; as alſo the difficulty, if not impoſſibility of ſending any relief to them at any diſtance, the depth of ſnow uſually making the ways unpaſſable for divers months together.</p>
            <p>ON the other hand, it was conſidered, that if the enemy were let alone till the next ſummer, it would be impoſſible to deal with them, or find them any where, but they might waſte one company of ſoldiers after another, as was ſeen by the experience of the former year. Conſidering alſo that the <hi>Narrhaganſets,</hi> the moſt numerous of all the reſt, and the beſt provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of proviſion of all the other Indians, had now declared themſelves our enemies, who if they were let alone till the winter was over, we ſhould be unable to deal with ſo many enemies at once, that could on a ſudden on any occaſion ſpread themſelves like graſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers all over the country.</p>
            <p>IT was therefore finally agreed upon by the general conſent of all, to fall upon the winter quarters of our enemies, by a more conſiderable army (if I may ſo call it) gathered out of all the three colonies, and that with all expedition, at fartheſt not to exceed the 10th of <hi>December,</hi> before they ſhould have a thouſand men in arms, ready for the deſign.</p>
            <p>AS for the late league made or rather renewed with the <hi>Narrhaghanſets,</hi> it was ſufficiently evident and known, that they had all along from the firſt day when it was confirmed, broken every article of it, eſpecially in not delivering up the enemies, which had

And beſides, the favouring of thoſe that fled to them, and ſupplying the whole body of the enemy with victuals, upon all occaſions. It was likewiſe ſtrongly ſuſpected that in all the late proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the enemy, many of their young men were known to be actually in arms againſt us, many of whom were found either wounded amongſt them in their wigwams, or elſewhere occaſionally ſeen return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back, after exploits abroad, to be healed of their wounds at home. Alſo ſome of our mens guns that were loſt at <hi>Deerfield,</hi> were found in the fort when it was fined. Therefore all ſcruples as to the juſtneſs and neceſſity of the war being removed, the only queſtion was, whether it were feaſible and expedient in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The exigent was very great, and the choice very hard: But as David when he was ſtreightened with many difficulties at once, choſe rather to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of God whoſe mercies were great, though he might be provoked to cauſe his jealouſy to ſmoak againſt thoſe of his own heritage for a time; ſo in this exigent it was generally conceived to be moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for the country, to caſt themſelves upon the providence of a merciful and gracious God, rather than by delays to expoſe themſelves to the treachery and cruelty of a perfidious enemy.</p>
            <p>A WAR therefore ſpeedily to be carried on in the very depth of winter. being agreed upon, care was taken for ſupplies, as the difficulty of ſuch an affairs ſo circumſtanced did require, though poſſibly not with ſo much neceſſary care, and ſo ſuitable proviſion, as had been deſired, if what came afterward to paſs could have been foreſeen (which peradventure might be the reaſon things went on ſo heavily for want of well oil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wheels) in the mean time a ſmall army of a a thouſand fighting men, well appointed, were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:014120_0131_0F93026B60D88220"/>by the Commiſſioners to be gathered by propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of all the colonies, of which number the ſhare of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> was to be 527, the reſt were to be ſupplied out of <hi>Plimouth</hi> and <hi>Connecticut</hi> colonies: All other ſupplies were taken care for, as well as the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denneſs of the expedition, and difficulty of the ſeaſon would allow. The ſaid thouſand men, beſide ſome voluntiers of Indian friends, were by the time and place appointed as near as could be had, called together, and a commiſſion granted to the honorable <hi>Joſiah Winſlow,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> the preſent Governor of <hi>Plimouth</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, a man of known ability and integrity, every way ſo well qualified with courage and reſolution, as well as prudence and diſcretion, as might have preferred him to the conduct of a far greater army than ever is like to be gathered together in this part of the world, in this or in following generations. And indeed as he was the firſt Governor over any of the united colonies in <hi>New England,</hi> of them that were born in the place, ſo may he well paſs for a pattern of any of the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing race, that may come after.</p>
            <p>UNDER him as Commander in Chief, were ordered ſix companies from the <hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Major <hi>Appleton,</hi> Capt. <hi>Moſely,</hi> Capt. <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener,</hi> Capt. <hi>Davenport,</hi> Capt. <hi>Oliver,</hi> Capt. <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;</hi> five companies from <hi>Connecticut</hi> under Major <hi>Treat,</hi> Capt. <hi>Siely,</hi> Capt. <hi>Gallop,</hi> Capt. <hi>Maſon,</hi> Capt. <hi>Watts,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Marſhall;</hi> two companies from <hi>Plimouth,</hi> under Major <hi>Bradford,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Goram.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>UNDER the Governor of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> as Commander in Chief in this expedition, were ſent as Majors of the forces belonging to each colony; Major <hi>Robert Treat,</hi> for the forces belonging to <hi>Connecticut,</hi> and Major <hi>Bradford,</hi> for thoſe of the colony of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and Major <hi>Samuel Appleton,</hi> for thoſe of the <hi>Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets,</hi> to whom by the honorable Major General of the colony, were ſix companies of foot, delivered at <hi>Ded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, December</hi> the 9th, 1675, containing in number
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:014120_0132_0F93026C5C8EE1F0"/>465 fighting men, beſides a troop of horſe, under the command of Capt. <hi>Thomas Prentice,</hi> attending upon them. That night they marched to <hi>Woodcock</hi>'s, about 27 miles from <hi>Dedham.</hi> The next night they arrived at <hi>Seaconck,</hi> Capt. <hi>Moſely</hi> and his company went from thence with Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> by water, the reſt ferſied over the water to <hi>Providence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE next day, <hi>December</hi> the 12th, they paſſed over <hi>Patuxet</hi> river, and then marching through <hi>Pomham</hi>'s country; at night they met with Capt. <hi>Moſely</hi> and his company, at Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>'s in <hi>Wickford,</hi> the place in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for their head-quarters. Capt. <hi>Moſely</hi> in his way thither had happily ſurpriſed 36 Indians, one of whom he took along with him as a guide, <hi>Peter</hi> by name, that was at that time under ſome diſguſt with his country-men, or his Sachem, which made him prove the more real friend to our forces in that ſervice, wherein he faithfully performed what he promiſed, and without his aſſiſtance our men would have been much at a loſs to have found the enemy, until it had been too late to have fought them.</p>
            <p>Two days after, <hi>December</hi> 14th, five files of men ſent out under ſerjeant <hi>Bonnet,</hi> and another, upon the ſcout, killed one man and one woman, and brought in four more by one of the clock: The whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany marched after into ſome of the Sachem's country, where they burnt an 150 wigwams, killed 7 of the enemy, and brought in 8 priſoners when they return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at night.</p>
            <p>THE next day an Indian called <hi>Stone wall John,</hi> pretended to come from the Sachems, intimating their willingneſs to have peace with the Engliſh, yet could the meſſenger hardly for bear threatning, vapour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their numbers and ſtrength, adding wichal that the Engliſh durſt not fight them: Whatever were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend by this treacherous fellow, ſome of his crew as he want home met with ſome of Capt. <hi>Gardner</hi>'s men, that were ſtragling about their own buſineſs, contrary
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:014120_0133_0F93026CDFEBF770"/>to order, and ſlew his ſerjeant with one or two more. Two alſo of Capt. <hi>Oliver</hi>'s men were killed in like manner; a ſolemn warning for ſoldiers not to be too venterous in an enemy's country. For preventing the like miſchief upon other companies, more care was taken as they paſſed to the head-quarters, ſome of the companies being lodged three miles therefrom. Capt. <hi>Moſely</hi>'s, Capt. <hi>Dapenport</hi>'s, and Capt. <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies being alſo ſent about that time to bring Major. <hi>Appleton</hi>'s to the general quarters, a few deſperate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians creeping under a ſtone wall near the place, fired twenty or thirty guns at <hi>Moſely</hi> in particular, a commander well known amongſt them, but the reſt of the company running down upon them, killed one of them, and ſcattered the reſt.</p>
            <p>THE next day Capt. <hi>Prentice</hi> with his troop, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent to <hi>Pettyquamſcot,</hi> returned with the ſad news of burning <hi>Jerry Bull</hi>'s garriſon houſe, and killing 10 Engliſh men and five women and children, but two eſcaped in all. This is the chance of war which they who undertake, muſt prepare to undergo.</p>
            <p>THE next day brought from the ſame place a little better news, though not enough to balance the ſorrow of the former, viz. that <hi>Connecticut</hi> forces were come thither with three hundred Engliſh, and an hundred and fifty <hi>Mohegins,</hi> ready fixed to war on the behalf of the Engliſh againſt the <hi>Narrhaganſets,</hi> their mortal enemies; and by the way meeting a party of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, they ſlew 5 or 6 of them and took as many pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners. The whole number of all our forces being now come, the want of proviſion with the ſharpneſs of the cold, minded them of expedition, wherefore the very next day, the whole body of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> and <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> forces marched away to <hi>Pettyquamſcot</hi> intending to engage the enemy upon the firſt opportunity that next offered itſelf: To the which reſolution thoſe of <hi>Connecticut</hi> preſently conſented, as ſoon as they met together, which was about five o'clock in the afternoon: <hi>Bull</hi>'s houſe intended for their general rendezvous, being unhappily burnt down two or three days before,
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:014120_0134_0F93026FE6C0CAA8"/>there was no ſhelter left either for officers or private ſoldiers, ſo as they were neceſſitated to march on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the enemy through the ſnow, in a cold ſtormy evening, finding no other defence all that night, ſave the open air, nor any other covering than a cold and moiſt fleece of ſnow. Through all theſe difficulties they marched from the break of the next day, <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 19th, till one of the clock in the afternoon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either fire to warm them, or reſpite to take any food, ſave what they could chew in their march. Thus having waded fourteen or fifteen miles through the country of the old Queen, or <hi>Sunke Squaw</hi> of <hi>Narrha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganſet,</hi> they came at one o'clock upon the edge of the ſwamp where their guide aſſured them they ſhould find Indians enough before night.</p>
            <p>OUR forces chopping thus upon the ſeat of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, upon the ſudden, they had no time either to draw up in any order or form of battle, nor yet opportunity to conſult where or how to aſſault. As they marched Capt. <hi>Moſely</hi> and Capt. <hi>Davenport</hi> led the van, Major <hi>Appleton</hi> and Capt. <hi>Oliver</hi> brought up the rear of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> forces; General <hi>Winſlow</hi> with the <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> forces marched in the centre; thoſe of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut</hi> came up in the rear of the whole body: But the frontiers diſcerning Indians in the edge of the ſwamp, fired immediately upon them, who anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our men in the ſame language, retired preſently into the ſwamp, our men followed them in amain, without ſtaying for the word of command, as if every one were ambitious who ſhould go firſt, never making any ſtand till they came to the ſides of the fort, into which the Indians that firſt fired upon them betook themſelves.</p>
            <p>IT ſeems that there was but one enterance into the fort, tho' the enemy found many ways to come out, but neither the Engliſh or their guide well knew on which ſide the enterance lay; nor was it eaſy to have made another; wherefore the good providence of Almighty God is the more to be acknowledged, who as he led
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:014120_0135_0F9302710559B488"/>
               <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſometimes by the pillar of fire, and the cloud of his preſence, a right way thro' the wilderneſs, ſo did he now direct our forces upon that ſide of the fort, where they might only enter through not without utmoſt danger and hazard. The fort was raiſed upon a kind of iſland of five or ſix acres of riſing land in the midſt of a ſwamp; the ſides of it were made of palizadoes, ſet upright, the which was compaſſed about with an hedge of almoſt a rod thickneſs, through which there was no paſſing, unleſs they could have fired a way through, which then they had no time to do. The place where the Indians uſed ordinarily to enter themſelves, was upon a long tree over a place of water, where but one man could enter at a time, and which was ſo way-laid that they would have been cut off that had ventured there: But at one corner there was a cap made up only with a long tree, about four or five foot from the ground, over which men might eaſily paſs: But they had placed a kind of a block-houſe right over againſt the ſaid tree, from whence they ſorely galled our men that firſt entered, ſome being ſhot dead upon the tree, as Capt. <hi>Johnſon;</hi> and ſome as ſoon as they entered, as was Capt. <hi>Davenport;</hi> ſo as they that firſt entered were forced preſently to retire, and fall upon their bellies till the fury of the enemy's ſhot was pretty well ſpent, which ſome companies that did not diſcern the danger, not obſerving, loſt ſundry of their men, but at the laſt two companies being brought up, beſides the four that firſt marched up, they animated one another, to make another aſſault, one of the commanders crying out, they run, they run, which did ſo encourage the ſoldiers that they preſently entered amain. After a conſiderable number were well entered, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently beat the enemy out of a flanker on the left hand, which did a little ſhelter our men from the enemy's ſhot, till more company came up, and ſo by degrees made up higher, firſt into the middle, and then into the upper end of the fort, till at laſt they made the enemy all retire from their ſconces, and fortified places, leaving multitudes of their dead bodies upon the place. <hi>Connecticut</hi> ſoldiers marching up in the rear, being not
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:014120_0136_0F93027170533F10"/>aware of the dangerous paſſage over the tree, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the enemy's block-houſe, were at their firſt enterance many of them ſhot down, although they came on with as gallant reſolution as any of the reſt, under the conduct of their wiſe and valiant leader, Major <hi>Treat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE brunt of the battle, or danger that day lay moſt upon the commanders whoſe part it was to lead on their ſeveral companies in the very face of death, or elſe all had been loſt; ſo as all of them with great valour and reſolution of mind, as not at all afraid to die in ſo good a cauſe, bravely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed on their men in that deſperate aſſault; leaving their lives in the place as the beſt teſtimony of their valour, and of love to the cauſe of God and their country: No leſs than fix brave Captains fell that day in the aſſault, viz. Capt. <hi>Davenport,</hi> Capt. <hi>Gardner,</hi> Capt. <hi>Johnſon,</hi> of the <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſets,</hi> beſides Lieutenant <hi>Upham,</hi> who died ſome months after of his wounds received at that time. Capt. <hi>Gallop</hi> alſo, and Capt. <hi>Siely,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Marſhall</hi> were ſlain of thoſe belonging to <hi>Connecticut</hi> colony. It is uſually ſeen that the valour of the ſoldiers is much wrapped up in the lives of their Commanders, yet was it found here, that the ſoldiers were rather enraged than diſcouraged by the loſs of their Commanders, which made them redouble their courage, and not give back after they were entered the ſecond time, till they had driven out their enemies: So after much blood and many wounds dealt on both ſides; the Engliſh ſeeing their advantage, began to fire the wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wams, where was ſuppoſed to be many of the enemies women and children deſtroyed, by the firing of at leaſt five or ſix hundred of their ſmoaky cells.</p>
            <p>IT is reported by them that firſt entered the Indians fort, that our ſoldiers came upon them when they were ready to dreſs their dinner, but our ſudden and unexpected aſſault put them beſide that work, making their cook-rooms too hot for them at that time, when they and their mitchin fried together: And probably ſome of them eat their ſuppers in a colder place that
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:014120_0137_0F930272201443D8"/>night: Moſt of their proviſion as well as their huts being then conſumed with fire, and thoſe that were left alive forced to hide themſelves in a cedar ſwamp, not far off, where they had nothing to defend them from the cold but bought of ſpruce and pine trees: For after two or three hours fight, the Engliſh became makers of the place, but not judging it tenable, after they had burned all they could ſet fire upon, they were forced to retreat, after the day light was almoſt quite ſpent, and were neceſſitated to retire to their quarters, full fifteen or ſixteen miles off, ſome ſay more, whither with their dead and wounded men they were to march, a difficulty ſcarce to be believed, as not to be paralleld almoſt in any former age.</p>
            <p>IT is hard to ſay who acquitted themſelves beſt in that day's ſervice, either the ſoldiers for their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like valour in fighting, or the Commanders for their wiſdom and courage, leading on in the very face of death. There might one have ſeen the whole body of that little regimental army, as buſy as bees in a hive, ſome bravely fighting with the enemy, others hauling off, and carrying away the dead and wounded men (which I rather note) that none may want the due teſtimony of their valour and faithfulneſs, though all ought to ſay, <hi>not unto us, but unto thy name, O Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>FOR though there might not be above three or four hundred at any time within the fort at once, yet the reſt in their turns came up to do what the exigence of the ſervice required in bringing off the dead and wounded men: <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> regiment, together with Captain <hi>Moſely,</hi> was very ſerviceable, for by that means the fort being clear of the dead bodies, it ſtruck a greater terror into the enemy, to ſee but eight or ten dead bodies of the Engliſh left, than to meet with ſo many hundreds of their own ſlain and wounded car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes. The number of the ſlain was not then known on the enemy's ſide, becauſe our men were forced to leave them on the ground: But our victory was found after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to be much more conſiderable than at the firſt
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:014120_0138_0F930272ED2EF0B8"/>was apprehended; for although our loſs was very great, not only becauſe of the deſperateneſs of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt itſelf (in ſuch a ſeaſon of the year, and at ſuch a diſtance from our quarters, whereby many of our wounded men periſhed, which might otherwiſe have been preſerved, if they had not been forced to march ſo many miles in a cold ſnowy night, before they could be dreſſed) yet the enemy loſt ſo many of their principal fighting men, their proviſion alſo was by the burning of their wigwams, ſo much of it ſpoiled, at the taking of their fort, and by ſurprizing ſo much of their corn about that time alſo; that it was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of their total ruin afterwards: They being at that time driven away from their habitations, and put by from planting for the next year, as well as deprived of what they had in ſtore for the preſent winter. What numbers of the enemy were ſlain is uncertain, it was confeſſed by one <hi>Poteck,</hi> a great Councellor amongſt them, afterwards taken at <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> and put to death at <hi>Boſton,</hi> that the Indians loſt 700 fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men that day, beſides 300 that died of their wounds, the moſt of them: The number of old men, women and childen, that periſhed either by fire, or that were ſtarved with hunger and cold, none of them could tell. There was above 80 of the Engliſh ſlain, and and 150 wounded, that recovered afterwards.</p>
            <p>THERE were ſeveral circumſtances in this victory very remarkable.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The meeting with one <hi>Peter</hi> a fugitive Indian, that upon ſome diſcontent, flying from the <hi>Narrhaganſets,</hi> offered himſelf to the ſervice of the Engliſh, and did faithfully perform what he promiſed, viz. to lead them to the ſwamp where the Indians had ſeated themſelves within a fort raiſed upon an iſland of firm earth, in the midſt of a ſwamp, whither none of the Engliſh could have piloted them without his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, the place being near eighteen miles from the place where they were quartered.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Their being by a ſpecial providence di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected juſt to a place where they found ſo eaſy enterance,
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:014120_0139_0F930273A5E11CF0"/>which if they had miſſed they could never have made a way through the hedge, with which they had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded the pallizadoes of the fort in half a day's time.</p>
            <p>AND Thirdly, If they had entered by the way left by the Indians for paſſage, they might have been cut off, before they could have come near their fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, In directing their motion to begin the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault juſt at the day they did, for if they had deferred but a day longer, there fell ſuch a ſtorm of ſnow the next day, that they could not have paſſed through it in divers weeks after: And on a ſudden there fell ſuch a thaw, that melted away both ice and ſnow, ſo that if they had deferred till that time, they could have found no paſſage into their fortified place.</p>
            <p>ALL which conſiderations put together, make it a ſignal favour of God to carry them through ſo many difficulties to accompliſh their deſired end. For after they were retired to their quarters, but ſixteen miles from that place, there was ſo great want of proviſion, the veſſels being frozen in at the harbour about <hi>Cape-Cod,</hi> that ſhould have brought them relief, and the froſt and ſnow ſet in ſo violently, that it was not poſſible for them, with all the force they could make (ſo many of their ableſt ſoldiers being ſlain and wounded) to have made another onſet: But the goodneſs of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God was moſt of all to be admired, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the hardſhips they endured that winter, in very cold lodgings, hard marches, ſcarcity of proviſion, yet not one man was known to die by any diſeaſe or bodily diſtemper, ſave them that periſhed of their wounds.</p>
            <p>OUR forces being compelled by the aforeſaid occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to lie ſtill ſome weeks after, hoped alſo that the enemy ſo ſorely broken, would gladly have ſued for peace: But as was ſaid of old, <hi>God hardened their
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:014120_0140_0F9302745D0BE9C0"/>hearts to their own ruin and deſtruction afterwards.</hi> For us ſoon as our ſoldiers were able to march, finding that all the enemy's overtures of peace, and prolonging of treaties, was only to gain time, that they might get away into the woods; they purſued after them, and ſometimes came upon their rear, but then they would immediately fly an hundred ways at once into ſwamp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, ſo as our men could not follow them, or if they did, could not ſee two of them together; ſo that now there was little good like to be done, unleſs they could take them at ſome advantage. At length having ſpent all their proviſion, and tiring themſelves in purſuing of them ſixty or ſeventy miles, up through the woods to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Marlborough</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> towns that lye on the road to <hi>Connecticut,</hi> having killed and taken near 70 of them, our ſoldiers were ordered to return towards <hi>Boſton,</hi> to recruit themſelves, ſuppoſing that the <hi>Narr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baganſets,</hi> and thoſe with them were ſo enfeebled that they would have no mind ſuddenly to aſſault any of the Engliſh towns.</p>
            <p>IF any deſire a more particular account of the loſs which we ſuſtained at the taking of the <hi>Narrhaganſet</hi> fort, <hi>December</hi> 19th, 1675, they may take it as here it follows:</p>
            <p>BESIDES the ſix Captains mentioned before, that either were ſlain in the aſſault, or died afterwards of their wounds, to whom may be reckoned Lieutenant <hi>Upham,</hi> that died lately at <hi>Boſton,</hi> of the wounds he then received:</p>

            <p>IF there had not been ſo great a diſtance between the place of the fight and their quarters, and ſo much cold attending them in their retiring thereunto, ſome better account might have been given of that expedition, than now they were able to do. For a march of ſixteen or eighteen miles is too much to breathe a freſh ſoldier, unleſs he were well mounted; but enough to kill the heart of them that have been wearied with a long and tedious fight. As for the coldneſs of the weather, although it be a good beſom to ſweep the chamber of the air (which might be the reaſon there was no more diſeaſes amongſt them) yet it is an unwelcome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion to wearied, eſpecially to wounded men, in ſo long a retreat.</p>
            <p>BUT the want of proviſion falling in, in conjunction with the unſeaſonableneſs of the weather, and length of the way, hindred our forces from any new attempt upon the enemy, which if they could have attended, it was thought it might have put an end to our troubles; but he that holdeth the ſcales of victory in his hand, turpeth them to which ſide; and by what degrees pleaſeth him beſt.</p>
            <p>THE reſt of the winter was ſpent in fruitleſs treaties about a peace; both ſides being well wearied with the late deſperate fight, were willing to refreſh themſelves the remaining part of the winter, with the ſhort ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a pretended peace, at leaſt with a talk or dream thereof: Our Commaſiders aim therein was chriſtian and good, if it had proceeded, <hi>ſc.</hi> to have
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:014120_0142_0F930275E3C14E18"/>prevented the ſhedding of more blood: And poſſibly ſome of the elder and wiſer of the enemy, did really deſire what was pretended by them all (for they had now full proof of the valour and reſolution of the Engliſh, which ſome of them upon former ſucceſſes might be ready to queſtion) and they could not but ſee their deſtruction already begun, in the loſs of their dwellings, and all their proviſions, as well as the ſlaughter of the beſt part of their fighting men; but through conſciouſneſs of their barbarous treachery and falſehood, they could not truſt others, and ſo were willing to run the utmoſt hazard, as people hardened to their own deſtruction. The particular paſſages of the treaty being carried on by the enemy only in pretence, and by our men (that ſoon diſcerned their fraud) rather out of neceſſity, to conceal their incapacity of engaging them anew, than any real expectation of a good effect, are not worthy the relating. However, though the foot were unable to do any ſervice in the depth of the ſnow, and ſharpneſs of the cold, the troop was ſent out upon all occaſions to ſcout about the country, who brought in daily much of the enemy's corn and beans, which they had hid in barns under the ground, or at leaſt kept them from making uſe of their own proviſion, or ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Engliſh cattle; now and then alſo bringing in priſoners from their quarters, as they were ſtragling about to get victuals.</p>
            <p>ON the 27th of <hi>December,</hi> Capt. <hi>Prentice</hi> was ſent into <hi>Pomham</hi>'s country, where he burnt near an hundred wigwams, but found never an Indian in any of them.</p>
            <p>ON the 28th of <hi>December,</hi> a ſquaw was ſent to them, who had been taken in the fight, with a proffer of peace, if they would ſubmit to ſuch terms as were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded; the principal of which was, the delivering up all <hi>Philip</hi>'s Indians that were with them; the ſquaw returned, not pretending that ſhe was lame and unable to come again; but the 30th of <hi>December,</hi> an Indian came from the Sachems, with ſeeming thanks for the
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:014120_0143_0F930276AA534FD8"/>peace proffered, yet complained we made war upon them, and gave them no notice; but his mouth was ſoon ſtopped, by the anſwer they made him: He owned, as the ſquaw had ſaid before, that they loſt 300 of their beſt fighting men, and ſo did two pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners of theirs, taken <hi>January</hi> the 4th, whereof one being of <hi>Philip</hi>'s company, was put to death. The meſſenger that was ſent was fairly diſmiſſed, with the expreſs mention of what terms they muſt expect, if they deſired a peace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>January</hi> 4th, there came two meſſengers from them, as they ſaid to make way for a treaty of peace; who laid the blame upon <hi>Canouchet,</hi> that came to <hi>Boſton</hi> in <hi>October</hi> laſt, to confirm the peace with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of the united colonies, as if he had miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed them, viz. that they were not by the former treaty to have delivered up the <hi>Wompanoogs,</hi> or <hi>Philip</hi>'s Indians, until the ſaid <hi>Canonchet</hi>'s brother, one of the hoſtages at <hi>Hartford,</hi> was releaſed. This was but a mere pretence, for he and they too, better underſtood the particulars of the agreement: For by chance the articles which they had of the peace concluded with them, were found open (whether purpoſely or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally was not known) in a wigwam in the fort, when it was taken, ſo as they could not be ignorant of the articles of the agreement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>January</hi> 5th, an Engliſh child of about three or four years old, taken from <hi>Warwick,</hi> was ſent in to put the better pretence upon the treaty mentioned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>January</hi> 8th, the meſſengers were ſent back, and told what they muſt truſt to. In the afternoon a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger came from <hi>Ninigret,</hi> the old Sachem of <hi>Narr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baganſet,</hi> who brought a letter from Mr. <hi>Stanton,</hi> the interpreter, ſignifying the reality of the ſaid <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigret,</hi> his friendſhip to the Engliſh, and the ſtreights of the enemy, that corn was two ſhillings a pint with them. Yet notwithſtanding all their difficulties, they rather delayed the time till they could get away, than
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:014120_0144_0F9302775A3AB0F0"/>really endeavoured the making a peace, as was ſoon manifeſt: For that young inſolent Sachem, <hi>Canonchet,</hi> and <hi>Panoquin,</hi> ſaid they would fight it out to the laſt man, rather than they would become ſervants to the Engliſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>January</hi> 10th, freſh ſupplies of ſoldiers came up from <hi>Boſton,</hi> wading through a ſharp ſtorm of ſnow, that bit ſome of them by the heels with the froſt. The next day one that came with them, going out with the ſcouts, fell amongſt the Indians barns, in one of which, as he was groping to find corn for the relief of his horſe, he catched hold of an Indian's hair, under the leaves, who preſently held up his hands, when the ſoldier was drawing his ſword, to ſpare his life, which was granted, but after he was brought to the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarters, he would own nothing but what was forced out of his mouth, by the woolding of his head with a cord, wherefore he was preſently judged to die as a <hi>Wompanoog.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>January</hi> 12th, another meſſenger came from <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicus,</hi> deſiring the ſpace of a month longer, wherein to iſſue the treaty, which ſo provoked the Commander of our forces, that they reſolved to have no more trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with the enemy, but prepare to aſſault them, with God's aſſiſtance, as ſoon as ever the ſeaſon would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and it was high time to take up that reſolution, for within a few day's after, they underſtood by ſome that were taken priſoners, that the enemy were gone, or going into the <hi>Nipmuck</hi> country.</p>
            <p>WITHIN a few days after, about the 16th of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi> the ſcouts brought in one <hi>Joſhua Tift,</hi> a rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gado Engliſhman, of <hi>Providence,</hi> that upon ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content amongſt his neighbours, had turned Indian, married one of the Indian ſquaws, renounced his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, nation, and natural parents, all at once, fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="115" facs="unknown:014120_0145_0F9302784C7915B0"/>This <hi>Tift</hi> being one of the company, was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the knee, and ſo was ſeized by the Engliſh; he had in his habit conformed himſelf to them amongſt whom he lived. After examination, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to die the death of a traitor. As to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion he was found as ignorant as an heathen, which no doubt cauſed the fewer tears to be ſhed at his funeral, ſtanders-by being unwilling to laviſh pity upon him that had diveſted himſelf of nature itſelf, as well as religion, in a time when ſo much pity was needed elſewhere, and nothing left beſides wherewith to relieve the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>January</hi> 21ſt. Capt. <hi>Prentice</hi>'s troop being abroad, met with a party of the enemy, of whom they took two priſoners, and killed nine; in which exploit, ſomething happened very remarkable, for one <hi>W. Dodge,</hi> of <hi>Salem,</hi> riding in company with another friend, they happened to meet with two Indians, the ſaid <hi>Dodge</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better horſed than his friend, made after the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, leaving his friend to deal with the hindmoſt, but his piſtol miſſed firing, whereupon the Indian taking him by the leg, turned him off his horſe, and getting upon him, was about killing him with his knife, which <hi>W. Dodge</hi> by chance eſpied, and came time enough to reſcue his friend, and diſpatch the Indian lying upon him, and yet overtook the firſt Indian he was purſuing, time enough to do his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs alſo: By that means he did three good offices at once, ſaved the life of one friend, and ſlew two of his enemies. But within two or three days after, the weather much altering from what it was, induced our forces to take the firſt opportunity to purſue the enemy, who as they underſtood by meſſengers from <hi>Providence,</hi> were now upon their flight into the <hi>Nipmuck</hi> country: But ſo many difficulties were caſt in their way, that they could not be ready time enough to prevent the miſchief they did at <hi>Warwick,</hi> as they took their farewell of their country.

Two that belonged to the ſaid <hi>Carpenter</hi> were wounded, and one of the enemy's ſlain. As they marched after the enemy, they found a good houſe burned, with a barn belonging to it. They perceived alſo that the enemy dealt much in horſe-fleſh, meeting with no leſs than ſixty horſes heads in one place, which they had left behind them. Our ſoldiers in their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, came upon their rear, killed and took about ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty of them, yet never could come to charge them, for they would preſently betake themſelves into ſwamps, and not two of them run together, ſo as they ſaw it was an endleſs work to proceed further in the chace of ſuch an enemy; but our forces having purſued them into the woods, between <hi>Marlborough</hi> and <hi>Brookfield,</hi> in the road toward <hi>Connecticut,</hi> were conſtrained to turn down to <hi>Boſton,</hi> in the beginning of <hi>February,</hi> for want of proviſion, both for themſelves and their horſes, which gave an occaſion to the loſs of thoſe leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer towns that were deſtroyed by the <hi>Nipnet</hi> Indians, who preſently joined with the <hi>Narrhaganſets,</hi> upon their firſt approach, as ſhall be related afterwards.</p>
            <p>ABOUT the 10th of <hi>February</hi> after, ſome hundreds of the Indians, whether <hi>Nipnets</hi> or <hi>Naſhaway</hi> men (is uncertain) belonging to him they call <hi>Sagamore Sam,</hi> and poſſibly ſome of the ſtouteſt of the <hi>Narrhaganſets</hi> that had eſcaped the winter brunt, fell upon <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> a ſmall village, of about fifty or ſixty families, and did much miſchief, burning moſt of the houſes that were not garriſoned: And which is moſt ſad and awful to conſider, the houſe of Mr. <hi>Rowlandſon,</hi> miniſter of the ſaid <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> which was garriſoned with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent number of the inhabitants; yet the fortification of the houſe being on the back ſide, cloſed up with fire-wood, the Indians got ſo near as to fire a leanter, which burning the houſe immediately to the ground, all the perſons therein were put to the hard choice, either to periſh by the flames, with the houſe, or to
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:014120_0147_0F93027C22F4B718"/>yield themſelves into the hands of thoſe cruel ſavages, which laſt (conſidering that a living dog is better than a dead lion) they choſe, and ſo were forty-two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſurprized by the Indians, above twenty of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children they carried away captive, a rueful ſpectacle to behold; the reſt being men, they killed in the place, or reſerved for further miſery: And many that were not ſlain in fighting, were killed in attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to eſcape. The miniſter himſelf was occaſionally abſent, to ſeek help from the Governor and Council to defend that place, who returning, was entertained with the tragical news of his wife and children ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, and being carried away by the enemy, and his houſe turned into aſhes, yet it pleaſed God ſo to uphold his heart, comforting himſelf in his God, as <hi>David</hi> at <hi>Ziklag,</hi> that he would always ſay, he believed he ſhould ſee his wife and children again, which did in like manner ſoon come to paſs within five or ſix months after; all, ſave the youngeſt, which being wounded at the firſt, died ſoon after among the Indians.<note n="¶" place="bottom">A particular account of the ſufferings and captivity of Mrs. <hi>Rowlandſon,</hi> written by herſelf, may be had of the publiſher hereof.

            </p>
            <p>AND ſuch was the goodneſs of God to thoſe poor captive women and children, that they found ſo much favor in the fight of their enemies, that they offered no wrong to any of their perſons, ſave what they could not help, being in many wants themſelves. Neither did they offer any uncivil carriage to any of the females, nor ever attempted the chaſtity of any of them, either being reſtrained of God, as was <hi>Abimeleck</hi> of old, or by ſome other accidental cauſe which withheld them from doing any wrong in that kind.</p>
            <p>UPON the report of this diſaſter, Capt. <hi>Wadſworth,</hi> then at <hi>Marlborough,</hi> with about forty reſolute men, adventuring the reſcuing of the town that was remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And having recovered a bridge, they got over ſafe, though the planks were pulled off by the enemy, and
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:014120_0148_0F93027D2A9A76B0"/>being led up in a way, not diſcovered by them, they forced the Indians for the preſent to quit the place, after hey had burnt and deſtroyed the better half of it. Yet afterwards it not being judged tenable, it was abandoned to the pleaſure of the inſulting foe.</p>
            <p>Ten days after they were ſo fluſhed with this ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, that two or three hundred of them came wheeling down to <hi>Medfield,</hi> a town twenty miles from <hi>Boſton,</hi> weſtward from <hi>Dedham,</hi> which they ſurprized very earl in the morning (and though there were one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty ſoldiers in it, or more, beſides the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants) they burnt near one half of the town, kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about twenty perſons, but by the reſiſtance of the ſoldiers, as ſoon as they could be rallied together (it being at or before break of day, none in the leaſt ſuſpecting ſuch an aſſault ſo early) they were quickly forced to forſake the place, and ſo (not without ſome loſs) took their way to <hi>Plimouth</hi> colony.</p>
            <p>THE weſtern towns above <hi>Connecticut</hi> were the chief ſeat of the war, and felt moſt of the miſchiefs thereof, in the end of the year 1675; but the ſcene is now to be changed; and the other towns and villages that lye eaſtward, nearer <hi>Boſton,</hi> muſt bear their part in the like tragedies: For as was ſaid before, the <hi>Narrha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganſets</hi> having been driven out of the country, fled through <hi>Nipnet</hi> plantations, towards <hi>Watchuſet</hi> hills, meeting with all the Indians that had harboured all winter in thoſe woods about <hi>Naſhaway,</hi> they all cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined againſt the Engliſh, yet divided their numbers, and one half of them were obſerved to bend their courſe toward <hi>Plimouth,</hi> taking <hi>Medfield</hi> in their way, which they endeavoured to burn and ſpoil, <hi>February</hi> 21ſt, 1675, as their fellows had done <hi>Lancaſter</hi> ten days before.</p>
            <p>THE ſurpriſal of this <hi>Medfield,</hi> in regard of ſome remarkable circumſtances it was attended with, is not unworthy a more particular relating as to the manner thereof: The loſs of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> had ſufficiently awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and alarmed the neighbouring villages, all to ſtand upon their guard; and ſome had obtained gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſoned ſoldiers for their greater ſecurity, as was the

            <p>THE Governor and Council of <hi>Plimouth</hi> perceiving by the report of theſe outrages committed upon the towns of the <hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> that they were like to be viſited this ſpring by their old neighbours, ſent out Capt. <hi>Peirce,</hi> of <hi>Scituate,</hi> about the latter end of <hi>March,</hi> with about fifty Engliſh, and twenty of their chriſtian Indians, about <hi>Cape-Cod,</hi> who proved none of his worſt ſoldiers, as the ſequal of this his laſt expedition will declare.</p>
            <p>CAPT. <hi>Pierce,</hi> as is ſaid before, being ſent out to purſue the enemy, marched towards <hi>Pautuxet,</hi> where he underſtood the Indians were many of them gathered together: He being a man of reſolute courage, was willing to engage them though upon never at ſo great diſadvantage: Some ſay the Indians by counterfeiting, drilled him into a kind of ambuſh; poſſibly more of them diſcovered themſelves after he began to engage than he was aware of; and being got over the river in purſuit of them, where he diſcovered ſo great a number of them, he drew down towards the ſide of the river, hoping the better by that means to prevent their ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding of him; but that proved his overthrow which he intended as his greateſt advantage: For the Indians getting over the river ſo galled him from thence, that he was not able to defend himſelf; thus aſſaulted on all ſides, and himſelf not being able to travel much a foot, was thereby hindred from retiring to any better place in time, ſo as he ſaw himſelf conſtrained to fight it out to the laſt, which he did with moſt undaunted courage, and as is ſaid, to the ſlaughter of an hundred and forty of his enemies, before himſelf and his company were cut off. It is ſaid alſo, that being apprehenſive of the danger he was in, by the great numbers of the enemy like to overpower him with their multitude, he ſeat a

            <p>IT is worth the noting, what faithfulneſs and courage ſome of the chriſtian Indians, with the ſaid Capt. <hi>Pierce,</hi> ſhewed in the fight: One of them, whoſe name was <hi>Amos,</hi> after the Captain was ſhot in his leg or thigh, ſo as he was not able to ſtand any longer, would not leave him, but charging his gun ſeveral times, fired ſtoutly upon the enemy, till he ſaw that there was no poſſibility for him to do any further good to Capt. <hi>Pierce,</hi> nor yet to ſave himſelf, if he ſtayed any longer; therefore he uſed this policy, perceiving the enemy had all blacked their faces, he alſo ſtooping down, pulled out ſome blacking out of a pouch be carried with him, diſcoloured his face therewith, and ſo making himſelf look as like <hi>Hohamackco,</hi> as any of his enemies, he ran amongſt them a little while, and was taken for one of them, as if he had been ſearching for the Engliſh, until he had an opportunity to eſcape away among the buſhes; therein imitating the cuttle fiſh, which when it is purſued, or in danger, caſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>February</hi> 25th, they aſſaulted <hi>Weymouth,</hi> and burnt ſeven or eight houſes and barns there, which <hi>Weymouth</hi> is a town lying towards <hi>Plimouth</hi> colony.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> 12th, following, they aſſaulted the houſe of one Mr. <hi>Clarke,</hi> in <hi>Plimouth,</hi> cruelly murdering ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven perſons that belonged to two families that lodged therein, and then fired the houſe. The cruelty towards theſe perſons was the more remarkable, in that they had often received much kindneſs from the ſaid <hi>Clarke.</hi> It is the uſual cuſtom of ſuch debtors, to uſe them worſt, of whom they have taken up much kindneſs upon truſt before hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> 17th, another party of them fell upon <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> a place beyond <hi>Philip</hi>'s land, toward the <hi>Narr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baganſet</hi> country, where they burnt down to the ground all but a few houſes, which they left ſtanding as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of their barbarous fury. The like miſchief was acted by them upon the houſes of the Engliſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the <hi>Narrhaganſet</hi> country.</p>
            <p>THIS 26th day of <hi>March,</hi> being the firſt day of the week, as the firſt of the year after our <hi>Julian</hi> account, ſeemed ominous at the firſt, on ſundry accounts, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a gloomy time, yet proved in the iſſue, but as a lowering morning before a lightſome day.</p>
            <p>FOR beſides the burning of <hi>Marlborough,</hi> at leaſt a great part of it, on the ſame day, a very ſad accident fell out the ſame time at <hi>Springfield,</hi> as ſhall be ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified hereafter; beſides that which befell Captain <hi>Pierce,</hi> which is already related, with whom fell ſo
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:014120_0155_0F9302829B6C0118"/>many of his ſoldiers on the ſame day alſo; yet had the enemy no cauſe to beaſt, being forced by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the Engliſh, to give ſo many of their own lives in exchange: Some few made their eſcape, as is ſaid, by ſubtle devices: Beſides the three forementioned, another by a like ſhift, not only ſaved himſelf, but helped an Engliſhman to eſcape alſo, whom he ran after, with his hatchet in his hand, as if he were about to kill him; whereby both of them made a ſhift to get away; the reſt were all loſt (the unfaithfulneſs of the meſſenger being as was intimated before, the cauſe of their ſlaughter) unto a few that hardly eſcaped by the advantage of the buſhes, giving them opportunity to paſs unſeen, yet was it confeſſed by a priſoner of the enemy, taken afterward by the Engliſh, that they loſt an hundred and forty in that encounter: And had not the ſaid Engliſh by wading after the enemy over a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, made their ammunition uſeleſs, there had not half ſo many of them been cut off. From thence they turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back towards <hi>Rehoboth,</hi> near <hi>Swanzy,</hi> where on <hi>March</hi> 28th, they burnt thirty barns, and near upon forty dwelling-houſes, thereby as it were threatning the utter deſolation of that poor town; and ſo proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on that ſide the country, they burnt the very next day about thirty houſes in <hi>Providence,</hi> in their way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Narrhaganſet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT it was now full ſea with <hi>Philip</hi>'s affairs, for ſoon after the tide of his ſucceſſes began to turn about the ſea coaſt, which made way for the falling of the water up higher in the country. For about this time news came to <hi>Boſton</hi> that our neighbours and friends of <hi>Connecticut</hi> colony, hearing of the attempts of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my on that ſide of the country, ſent a party of their ſoldiers, under the command of Capt. <hi>George Deniſon,</hi> with ſome friendly Indians, part <hi>Mohegins</hi> and <hi>Pequods,</hi> part <hi>Nianticks,</hi> belonging to <hi>Ninigret,</hi> a <hi>Narrhaganſet</hi> Sachem, who never engaged in this quarrel againſt the Engliſh; who in purſuit of the enemy, meeting with a conſiderable part of them about the <hi>Narrhaganſet</hi>

This victory was the more conſiderable, in that ſeveral of the chief Captains of the enemy were at this time killed or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; amongſt whom was <hi>Canonchet</hi> (who came down to get ſeed corn to plant at <hi>Squakbeag</hi>) he was the chief Sachem of all the <hi>Narrhaganſets,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Mianto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimoh,</hi> and the heir of all his father's pride and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, as well as of his malice againſt the Engliſh, a moſt perfidious villian, who had the laſt <hi>October</hi> been at <hi>Boſton,</hi> pretending to make a firm peace with the Engliſh, but never intending to keep one article there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: Therefore, as a juſt reward of his wickedneſs he was adjudged by thoſe that took him, to die, which was accordingly put in execution at <hi>Stonington,</hi> whither he was carried; there his head being cut off, was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to <hi>Hartford:</hi> The <hi>Mohegins</hi> and <hi>Pequods</hi> that had the honor to take him priſoner, having the honor likewiſe of doing juſtice upon him, and that by the prudent advice of the Engliſh Commanders, thereby the more firmly to engage the ſaid Indians againſt the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous <hi>Narrhaganſets.</hi> There are diff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>CONCERNING the <hi>Narrhaganſets,</hi> this is further to be added here, that Mr. <hi>Thomas Stanton,</hi> and his ſon <hi>Robert,</hi> who have a long time lived amongſt them, and beſt acquainted with their language and manners of any in <hi>New-England,</hi> do affirm, that to their knowledge, the <hi>Narrhaganſet</hi> Sachems before the late troubles, had two thouſand fighting men under them, and nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred arms, yet they are at this day ſo broken and ſcattered, that there is none of them left on that ſide of the country, unleſs ſome few, not exceeding ſeventy in number, that have ſheltered themſelves under the

            <p>THE firſt week in <hi>April,</hi> 1676, <hi>Canonchet,</hi> their chief Sachem, having with this people been driven out of his own country, by the ſword of the Engliſh, the winter before, breathed ſtill nothing but rage and cruelty againſt them, bearing himſelf upon his great numbers: Yet as appeared in the iſſue, himſelf and they that eſcaped with him, were not ſo much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from the preſent calamity that befell the reſt in their fort, as reſerved to another and more ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious death. For the whole body of the Indians to the weſtward, truſting under the ſhadow of that aſpiring bramble; he took a kind of care of them upon himſelf: wherefore foreſeeing ſo many hundreds could not well ſubſiſt without planting, he propounded it in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, that all the weſt plantations upon <hi>Connecticut</hi> river, taken from the Engliſh, ſhould this laſt ſummer be planted with Indian corn; which was indeed in itſelf a very prudent conſideration: To that end he reſolved to venture himſelf with but thirty men (the reſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining it) to fetch ſeed-corn from <hi>Seaconk,</hi> the next town to <hi>Mount-hope,</hi> leaving a body of men, not few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than fifteen hundred to follow him, or meet him about <hi>Seaconk</hi> the week after. This adventure brought him into the ſnare, from whence he could not eſcape: For Capt. <hi>George Deniſon,</hi> of <hi>Stonington,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Avery,</hi> of <hi>New-London,</hi> having raiſed forty-ſeven En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, the moſt part volunteers, with eighty Indians, twenty of which were <hi>Narrhaganſets,</hi> belonging to <hi>Ninigret,</hi> commanded by one called <hi>Catapazet;</hi> the reſt <hi>Pequods,</hi> under <hi>Caſaſinamon,</hi> and <hi>Mohegins</hi> under <hi>Oneco,</hi> ſon to <hi>Uncas,</hi> being now abroad upon their third expedition, which they began <hi>March</hi> 27th, 1676, and ended on the 10th of <hi>April</hi> following: They met with a ſtout Indian of the enemy's whom they preſently ſlew, and two old ſquaws, that confeſſed <hi>Nanunttenoo,</hi> alias <hi>Canonchet</hi> (thoſe chief Sachems uſually changing
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:014120_0158_0F930284D8810E58"/>their names at every great dance, and by that name of <hi>Nanunttenoo</hi> was he then known) was not far off; which welcome news put new life into the wearied ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that had travelled hard many days, and met with no booty till now; eſpecially when it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by intelligence the ſame inſtant, brought in by their ſcouts, that they met with new tracks, which brought them in view of ſome wigwams, not far from <hi>Pautuket,</hi> by ſome called <hi>Blackſtone</hi>'s river, in one of which the ſaid Sachem was at that moment diverting himſelf with the recital of Capt. <hi>Pierce</hi>'s ſlaughter, ſurprized by his men a few days before, but the alarm of the Engliſh at that time heard by himſelf, put by that diſcourſe, apalled with the ſuddeneſs thereof, as if he had been informed by ſecret item from <hi>Heaven,</hi> that now his own turn was come; ſo as having but 7 men about him, he ſent up two of them to the top of the hill, to ſee what the matter was, but they affrighted with the near approach of the Engliſh, at that time with great ſpeed mounting over a fair champagna on the other ſide of the hill, ran by, as if they wanted time to tell what they ſaw; preſently he ſent a third, who did the like; then ſending two more on the ſame errand, one of theſe laſt endued with more courage, or a better ſenſe of his duty, informed him in great haſte that all the Engliſh army was upon him; whereupon, having no time to conſult, and but little to attempt an eſcape, and no means to defend himſelf; he began to dodge with his purſuers, running round the hill on the contrary ſide; but as he was running ſo haſtily by, <hi>Catapazat,</hi> with twenty of his followers, and a few of the Engliſh, lighteſt of foot, gueſſed by the ſwiftneſs of his motion, that he fled as if an enemy, which made them immediately take the chace after him, as for their lives; he that was the ſwifter purſuer put him ſo hard to it, that he caſt off firſt his blanket, then his ſilver laced coat (given him at <hi>Boſton,</hi> as a pledge of their friendſhip, upon the renewal of his league in <hi>October</hi> before) and belt of peag, which made <hi>Catapazat</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it was the right bird, which made them purſue as eagerly as the other fled; ſo as they forced him to

This was the confuſion of a damned wretch, that had often opened his mouth to blaſpheme the name of the living God, and thoſe that make profeſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. He was told at large of his breach of faith, and how he boaſted he would not deliver up a <hi>Wampanoog,</hi> or the paring of a <hi>Wampanoog</hi>'s nail, that he would
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:014120_0160_0F9302868433BEA0"/>burn the Engliſh alive in their houſes; to which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, others were as forward for the war as himſelf; and that he deſired to hear no more thereof. And when he was told his ſentence was to die, he ſaid, he liked it well, that he ſhould die before his heart was ſoft, or had ſpoken any thing unworthy of himſelf. He told the Engliſh before they put him to death, that the killing him would not end the war; but it was a conſiderable ſtep thereunto, nor did it live much longer after his death, at leaſt, not in thoſe parts; for after <hi>Sudbury</hi> fight, when the ſun of their hopes was at its higheſt; <hi>April</hi> the 18th following, it viſibly declined, till it ſet in a night of obſcure and utter darkneſs upon them all, as is to be feared.</p>
            <p>THE inhabitants of <hi>New London, Norwich,</hi> and <hi>Stonington,</hi> apprehenſive of their danger, by reaſon of the near bordering of the enemy, and upon other pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent conſiderations, voluntarily liſted themſelves under ſome able gentlemen, and reſolute ſoldiers, amongſt themſelves, Major <hi>Palmes,</hi> Capt. <hi>George Deniſon,</hi> Capt. <hi>Avery,</hi> with whom, or under whom, within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of the year 1676, they made ten or more ſeveral expeditions, in all which, at thoſe ſeveral times, they killed and took two hundred and thirty-nine of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, by the help and aſſiſtance of the <hi>Pequods, Mohegins,</hi> and a few friendly <hi>Narrhaganſets;</hi> beſides thirty taken in the long march homeward, after the fort fight, <hi>December</hi> 19th, 1675; and beſides ſixteen captivated in the ſecond expedition, not reckoned within the compaſs of the ſaid number; together with fifty guns, and ſpoiling the enemy of an hundred buſhels of corn.</p>
            <p>IN <hi>January</hi> they went again in purſuit, and took five men and a boy. Certain <hi>Nipnets</hi> intended to have ſheltered themſelves under <hi>Uncas;</hi> but he perceiving it would be diſtaſteful to the Engliſh, ſoon ſhabbed them off, ſo as they were in the beginning of the winter brought into <hi>Boſton,</hi> many of them by <hi>Peter Ephraim,</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Pityme,</hi> with their fellows.</p>

IN all which exploits, neither they, nor any of their followers ſuſtained any loſs by the ſword of the enemy, or ſickneſs; as is expreſly declared by the Reverend Miniſter of <hi>Stonington,</hi> Mr. <hi>James Noyee,</hi> which is a matter very admirable to conſider, engaging all that were any way concerned in ſuch ſignal teſtimonies of divine favour, to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>NOT long after Capt. <hi>George Deniſon,</hi> of <hi>Stonington,</hi> with ſixty-ſix-volunteers, and an hundred and twelve <hi>Pequods,</hi> killed and took ſeventy-ſix of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, amongſt whom were two <hi>Narrhaganſet</hi> Sachems, one of which was the grand-child of <hi>Pomham</hi> (who is accounted the moſt warlike, and the beſt ſoldier of all the <hi>Narrhaganſet</hi> Sachems) taking at the ſame time 160 buſhels of the enemy's corn, no ſmall damage to our enemies at that time, and all this without the loſs of one man of the ſaid Captain's followers.</p>
            <p>The greateſt miſchief which after this time was done by the enemy in <hi>Plimouth</hi> colony, was by burning of houſes and barns, which they might eaſily do, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants in moſt of thoſe towns being repaired to gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon houſes for their greater ſecurity: For about the 20th of <hi>April,</hi> fifty of the enemy burnt about nineteen houſes and barns at <hi>Scituate,</hi> but were ſo reſolutely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered by a few of the inhabitants, that they were driven away, and thereby prevented from doing of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miſchief.</p>
            <p>NOT long after, <hi>May</hi> 8th, they burnt about ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen houſes and barns in <hi>Bridgewater,</hi> a ſmall town in <hi>Plimouth</hi> colony, twelve miles on this ſide <hi>Taunton;</hi> but it pleaſed God juſt at the time to ſend a thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhower, which put out the fire, or elſe it might have prevailed much further.</p>
            <p>IT is very remarkable, that the inhabitants of the ſaid <hi>Bridgewater,</hi> never yet loſt one perſon by the
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:014120_0162_0F93028A953A2888"/>ſword of the enemy, though the town is ſituate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Plimouth</hi> colony, yet they have helped to deſtroy many of the enemy. None knows either love or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred by all that is before them in things of this nature; nor ought ſtanders-by that may eſcape, think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves leſs ſinners than thoſe that ſo periſh by the ſword of the enemy: Yet about this time four of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Taunton</hi> were killed as they were at their work in the field, whereby it is ſaid, thirty children were made fatherleſs: <hi>So unſearchable are the judgments of the Almighty, and his ways paſt finding out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>DURING theſe calamities, God's diſpenſations have been very various, as well in reference unto towns and villages, as unto perſons: As if ſome places had been by ſpecial providence marked out to preſervation, as others unto deſtruction; of which no other reaſon can be rendered according unto man, than the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God ſo to order and diſpoſe of events, which <hi>ſometimes,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>are all one to the good, and to the clean, and to the unclean.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND becauſe ſpecial notice is taken of the town of <hi>Bridgewater,</hi> the which although it is ſeared, as it were, in the midſt of danger, and hath been often aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted by conſiderable numbers of the enemy, yet never loſt any one of their inhabitants, young or old; a particular account ſhall here be given of the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable paſſages of divine providence relating to that plantation ſince the war began. <hi>June</hi> 26th, 1675, when <hi>Philip</hi>'s malice againſt the Engliſh, mixed with a particular prejudice againſt Governor <hi>Winſlow,</hi> began to boil up to the height of an open rebellion; the people of <hi>Swanzy</hi> being like to be diſtreſſed by the Indians, a poſt was inſtantly ſent to the Governor of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> the way lying through <hi>Bridgewater;</hi> the ſaid poſt returned the next day, and about 9 or 10 of the clock, as he paſſed through the town, left an order from the Governor for the raiſing of twenty men, well armed, and furniſhed with horſes, to be forthwith diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched away for the relief of <hi>Swanzy;</hi> ſeventeen were

After they had marched five miles of their way, having Mr. <hi>Brown</hi>'s ſon for their pilot, they met with ſome <hi>Swanzy</hi> people, newly turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of their houſes (by which they were to paſs) who having not as yet reſiſted unto blood, yet ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THE next day in the morning, a part of them went to guard Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> their pilot, back to his quarters; in their return they came ſuddenly upon a party of Indians, about thirty in all; they were within ſhot of one another, but the Engliſh having no commiſſion to fight till they were aſſaulted, and not being impended in their paſſage, they returned ſafe to their garriſon at <hi>Metapoiſet:</hi> The Indians preſently drawing off, and firing three guns (though not with intent to do them any hurt, as was conceived) gave a ſhout, and ſo le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t them. When this party of the Engliſh drew near to their garriſon, they met with a company of carts going to fetch corn from an houſe deſerted near by, about a quarter of a mile off from Mr. <hi>Bourn</hi>'s houſe, the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers gave them notice of the Indians which they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:014120_0164_0F93028C571E6948"/>and withal adviſed them by no means to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture any more, becauſe of the danger; but they were reſolved notwithſtanding theſe earneſt perſuaſions of the ſoldiers to have another turn, which they ſoon found to be to the peril of their own lives, ſix of them being preſently after killed right out, or mortally wounded, as ſoon as they came to the barn where was the corn; theſe ſix are ſaid to be the firſt that were ſlain in this quarrel. The ſoldiers at the garriſon hearing the guns, made what haſte they could to the place, but being moſt of them in that interim gone to look their horſes, they could not come time enough to the relief of their friends, yet upon their approach, they who had done the miſchief preſently fled away: One <hi>Jones</hi> hard pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by two Indians, was by their coming delivered from the extent of the enemy's cruelty, but having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his mortal wound, had only that favour thereby, to die in the arms of his friends, though by the wounds received from his enemies.</p>
            <p>THE next week, fifteen of thoſe ſoldiers looking after their horſes, fell into an ambuſh of twenty of the Indians, but being prepared for the encounter, they diſcharged their guns upon each other; but our men received no hurt, ſome of them felt the wind of the bullets paſſing by their faces; what damage the enemy received is uncertain, yet ſome of the Engliſh report they found ſome of their enemies dead bodies in the place afterward.</p>
            <p>THUS were they not only preſerved in many perils themſelves, but became inſtrumental alſo for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of moſt of that garriſon, who with their goods, by their means, with the help of a ſmall party of <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> forces, ſent thither after the ſix were killed (as is mentioned before) were ſoon after tranſported ſafely to <hi>Read-Iſland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MANY outrages were that ſummer committed upon their neighbours at <hi>Taunton</hi> and <hi>Namaſket,</hi> yet it pleaſed God to protect this poor town of <hi>Bridgewater</hi> from any
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:014120_0165_0F93028E428D7528"/>other hurt, till the beginning of <hi>April</hi> following, when themſelves, with their neighbours of <hi>Taunton</hi> and <hi>Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both,</hi> were ſtrongly ſolicited to deſert their dwellings, and repair down to the towns by the ſea ſide, but God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged them to keep their ſtations, notwithſtanding the extream danger then preſented. It is reported that <hi>Philip</hi> gave orders that <hi>Taunton</hi> and <hi>Bridgewater</hi> ſhould not be deſtroyed till the laſt, which is all the favour to be expected from an enemy, but theſe things are only in the hands of God, and not to be determined by man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 9th, being Lord's day, a ſmall party of the enemy came down upon the ſaid <hi>Bridgewater,</hi> burnt an out houſe and barn, broke up and rifled ſeveral other houſes in the ſame quarter of the town, which are not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding yet remaining; they ſent out a party of their men to purſue them that night, and many days after, but could not hear of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 7th, the Lord's day alſo (no doubt but the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of the day, will increaſe the badneſs of their deed attempted thereon) they had intelligence of a great body of Indians diſperſed that way, with intent to have fallen upon the town that very day, but were caſually prevented by a great deal of rain that fell the night before; however, they were reſolved not to miſs the opportunity, wherefore on the next day (<hi>May</hi> 8th) about three hundred of them, one <hi>Tiſguogen</hi> being their chief leader, at 8 or 9 in the morning made an aſſault upon the ecaſt end of the town, on the ſouth ſide of the river: Many of the inhabitants ſtayed at home that morning, becauſe of the intelligence the day before, and ſo were the more ready to entertain them; ſome that not taking that warning, ventured into the field about their occaſions, were in danger of ſurprizal, but by the ſpecial favour of God eſcaped, and came time enough to help defend their own and their neighbours dwellings, being ſhot at, and hard purſued a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable way.</p>
            <p>THE Indians preſently began to fire the town, but it pleaſed God ſo to ſpirit and encourage ſeveral of the
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:014120_0166_0F93028EC8CD3838"/>inhabitants, iſſuing out of their garriſon houſes, that they fell upon them with great reſolution, and beat them off; at the ſame inſtant of time, the Lord of Hoſts alſo fighting for them from Heaven, by ſending a ſtorm of thunder and rain very ſeaſonably, which prevented the burning of the houſes which were fired: The ſoldiers alſo fighting under the banner of God's ſpecial protection, were ſo ſucceſsful in repelling the enemy, that they neither had any of the inhabitants killed or taken, and but one wounded. The Indians by this ſtout reſiſtance, being beaten off to the ſkirts of the town, made a freſh onſet upon another quarter thereof, on the north ſide of the river, where they had done much more miſchief, but that God ſtirred up ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry of the people to venture out of their fortified houſes, who fired upon the enemy, and beat them from their dwellings, ſo as in the evening they drew off to an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, three miles diſtant from the town: The next day the inhabitants expected another aſſault, but the enemy having burnt the houſe and barn were they kept their rendezvous over night, and one houſe more not far diſtant, they marched all clear away for that time.</p>
            <p>THUS it pleaſed God ſo to order his diſpenſations toward this ſmall town, as a brand plucked out of the fire, that they did but juſt taſte of this bitter cup, which others drank deeper of; yet had they not ſuch mercy, as theſe had, mixed therewith: Under God, the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of the inhabitants was a great means of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, for they fired ſo ſtoutly upon the enemy, that they durſt not come very near any of the garriſoned houſes, ſaluting them only at a diſtance. God was emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently ſeen upholding the ſpirits of all ſorts, men and women, ſo as no conſternation of mind was ſeen upon any of them, during the whole time of the diſpute.</p>
            <p>IN this aſſault they loſt but thirteen dwelling houſes, whereof five only were in the town (the reſt being out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, and deſerted for the preſent,) with ſome few <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rns, and ſome of their cattle; all which was a very
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:014120_0167_0F93028F58B38838"/>inconſiderable loſs, in compariſon of what befel others, and themſelves might have endured, if God had not by his ſpecial favour prevented.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 14th and 15th, another party of Indians came down upon the north-weſt ſide of the town, but with no better ſucceſs; for they had no commiſſion from the Lord of Hoſts to touch any of the perſons of the inhabitants, their power reaching only to the ſlaying of their cattle at this time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 18th, 19th, and 20th, they ſent our parties after the enemy to purſue them by their track, who fell upon ſome of them. On the 20th they took ſixteen, whereof two were men: On this day they had to aſſiſt them, it ſeems, ſome of the Bay Indians, ſent them from Capt. <hi>Brattle;</hi> ſome of the captives informed that there were but ſeventy or eighty in the company, and but ten or twelve men amongſt them: But within a few days theſe <hi>Bridgewater</hi> men ſhall find better ſucceſs in purſuit of their enemies, when <hi>Philip</hi> himſelf ſhall hardly eſcape their hands, as ſhall be ſeen afterwards.</p>
            <p>WHILE one party of the enemy thus acted their part in and and about <hi>Plimouth</hi> colony, towards the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaſt, other parties of them were not idle in the <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſets</hi> colony, where they aſſaulted many places, doing what miſchief they could by firing of houſes, and killing ſeveral perſons in the inland plantations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> 2d, they aſſaulted <hi>Groton;</hi> the next day over night Major <hi>Willard,</hi> with ſeventy horſe came into the town; forty foot alſo came up to their relief from <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertown,</hi> but the Indians were all fled, having firſt burnt all the houſes in the town, ſave four that were garriſoned, the meeting-houſe being the ſecond houſe they fired; ſoon after Capt. <hi>Sill</hi> was ſent with a ſmall party of dragoons, of eight files, to fetch off the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Groton,</hi> and what was left from the ſpoil of the enemy, having under his conduct about ſixty carts,
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:014120_0168_0F930290213B2038"/>being in depth from front to rear above two miles, when a party of Indians lying in ambuſh, at a place of eminent advantage, fired upon the front and mortally wounded two of the firſt carriers, who both died the next night; and might (had God permitted) have done eminent damage to the whole body, it being a full hour before the whole body could be drawn up, which was done with care and courage; but the Indians after a few more ſhot made, without doing harm, retired, and made no further aſſault upon them, being the ſame party of Indians which the day before had burnt ſome part of <hi>Chelmsford.</hi> Soon after this village was deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and deſtroyed by the enemy; yet it was a ſpecial providence, that though the carts were guarded with ſo ſlender a convoy, yet there was not any conſiderable loſs ſuſtained.</p>
            <p>THE ſurprizal of <hi>Groton</hi> was after this manner: On <hi>March</hi> 2d, the Indians came in the night and rifled eight or nine houſes, and carried away ſome cattle, and alarmed the town.</p>
            <p>ON <hi>March</hi> 9th, about ten in the morning, a parcel of Indians (having two days lurked in the town, and taken poſſeſſion of three out-houſes, and feaſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with corn, divers ſwine and poultry, which they there ſeized) laid an ambuſh for two carts, which went from their garriſon to fetch in ſome hay, attended with four men, two of which eſpying the enemy, made a difficult eſcape, the other two were ſet upon, and one of them ſlain, ſtript naked, his body mangled, and dragged into the high-way, and laid on his back in a moſt ſhameful manner: The other taken captive, and after ſentenced to death; but the enemy not concurring in the manner of it, execution was deferred, and he by the providence of God eſcaped by a bold attempt the night before he was deſigned to have been ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and fled to the garriſon at <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> the cattle in both towns wounded, and five of them ſlain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> 13th was the day when the enemy came in a full dody, by their own account four hundred, and
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:014120_0169_0F9302921CC2BF48"/>thought by the inhabitants to be not many leſs. The town was at this time (having been put into a fright by the ſad cataſtrophe of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> the next bordering town) gathered into five garriſons, four of which were ſo near together, as to be able to command from one to the other, between which were the cattle belonging to thoſe families, driven into paſtures, which afterwards proved their preſervation; the other was near a mile diſtant from the reſt.</p>
            <p>THIS morning the Indians (having in the night placed themſelves in ſeveral parts of the town) made their onſet; which began near the four garriſons; for a body of them having placed themſelves in ambuſcado, behind a hill, near one of the garriſons, two of them made diſcovery of themſelves, as if they had ſtood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on diſcovery. At this time divers of the people, not ſuſpecting any ſuch matter (for the day before, many had been upon diſcovery many miles, and found no ſigns of an enemy being ſo near) were attending their occaſions, ſome foddering their cattle, ſome milking their cows, of whom the enemy might eaſily have made a ſeizure, but God prevented; they having another deſign in hand, as ſoon after appeared: Theſe two Indians were at length eſpyed, and the alarm given; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the moſt of the men in the next garriſon, and ſome alſo in the ſecond (which was about eight or nine pole diſtant) drew out and went to ſurprize thoſe two Indians, who kept their ſtation till our men reached the brow of the hill, then aroſe the ambuſh and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged a volley upon them, which cauſed a diſorderly retreat, or rather a rout, in which one was ſlain, and three others wounded: Mean while another ambuſh had riſen, and come upon the back ſide of the garriſon ſo deſerted of men, and pulled down the pallizadoes: The ſoldiery in this rout, retreated not to their own, but paſſed by to the next garriſon, the women and children mean while expoſed to hazard, but by the goodneſs of God made a ſafe eſcape to the other forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied houſe, without any harm, leaving their ſubſtance to the enemy, who made a prey of it, and ſpent the
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:014120_0170_0F93029258E55E08"/>reſidue of the day in removing the corn and houſhold ſtuff (in which loſs five families were impoveriſhed) and firing upon the other garriſon: Here alſo they took ſome cattle. No ſooner was the ſignal given by the firſt volley of ſhot, but immediately in ſeveral parts of the town at once, did the ſmoke ariſe, they firing the houſes.</p>
            <p>IN the afternoon they uſed a ſtratagem not unlike the other, to have ſurprized the ſingle garriſon, but God prevented. An old Indian, if an Indian paſſed along the ſtreet with a black ſheep on his back, with a ſlow pace, as one decrepid; they made ſeveral ſhot at him, but miſſed him, at which ſeveral iſſued out to have taken him alive, but the watchman ſeaſonably <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>THE night following the enemy lodged in the town, ſome of them in the garriſon they had ſurprized, but the body of them in an adjacent valley, where they made themſelves merry after their ſavage manner. The next morning they gave two or three volleys at Capt. <hi>Parker</hi>'s garriſon, and ſo marched off, fearing as was thought, that ſupply might be nigh at hand. This aſſault of theirs was managed with their wonted ſubtlety and barbarous cruelty; for they ſtript the body of him whom they had ſlain in the firſt onſet, and then cutting off his head, fixed it upon a pole, looking towards his own land. The corpſe of the man ſlain the week be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they dug up out of his grave, they cut off his head and one leg, and ſet them upon poles, and ſtript off his winding ſheet. An infant which they found dead, in the houſe firſt ſurprized, they cut in pieces, which afterward they caſt to the ſwine. There were about forty dwelling houſes burnt at that time, beſides other buildings. This deſolation was followed with the breaking up of the town, and ſcattering of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and removal of the candleſtick after it had been there ſeated above twelve years.</p>

CONCERNING the ſurprizing of <hi>Groton, March</hi> 13, there was not any thing much more material than what is already mentioned, ſave only the inſolency of <hi>John Monoco,</hi> or <hi>one eyed John,</hi> the chief Captain of the Indians in that deſign; who having by a ſudden ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizal, early in the morning, ſeized upon a garriſon houſe in one end of the town, continued in it, plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what was there ready at hand, all that day; and at night did very familiarly in appearance, call out to Capt. <hi>Parker,</hi> that was lodged in another garriſon houſe, and entertained a great deal of diſcourſe with him, whom he called his old neighbour; dilating upon the cauſe of the war, and putting an end to it by a friendly peace; yet oft mixing bitter ſarcaſams, with ſeveral blaſphemous ſcoffs and taunts, at their praying and worſhiping God in the meeting-houſe, which he derid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſaid he had burnt. Among other things which he boaſtingly uttered that night, he ſaid he burnt <hi>Medfield,</hi> (though it be not known whether he was there perſonally preſent or no) <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and that now he would burn that town of <hi>Groton,</hi> and the next time he would burn <hi>Chelmsford, Concord, Watertown, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, Charloſtown, Roxbury, Boſton,</hi> adding at laſt in their dialect, what me will, me do: Not much unlike the proud <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> (if his power had been equal to his pride) ſometimes threatened againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but was by the remarkable providence of God, ſo confounded within a few months after, that he was bereft of his four hundred and fourſcore (of which he now boaſted) and only with a few more braggadocio's like himſelf, <hi>Sagamore Sam, old Jethro,</hi> and the <hi>Sagamore</hi> of <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baog,</hi> were taken by the Engliſh, and was ſeen (not long before the writing of this) marching towards the gallows (through <hi>Boſton</hi> ſtreets, which he threatened to burn at his pleaſure) with an halter about his neck, with which he was hanged at the town's end, <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 26th, in this preſent year, 1676. <hi>So let thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies periſh O Lord,</hi> and ſuch contempt be poured on all them that open their mouths to blaſpheme thy holy name.</p>

            <p>THE danger which theſe inland towns were like to be expoſed unto from the enemy, after they were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of the <hi>Narrhaganſet</hi> country, was foreſeen by the Council of the <hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> yea they had ſome intimation thereof from the enemy themſelves; but they were not well able to prevent it in that unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time of the year; no way fit for marching of ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and tranſporting of proviſions (the winter then beginning to break up in this country) for while our forces were up in the <hi>Narrhaganſet</hi> country in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a couple of chriſtan Indians were ſent as ſpies into the <hi>Nipnet</hi> and <hi>Narrhaganſet</hi> country, through the woods, in the depth of winter, when the ways were impaſſable for any other ſort of people: Theſe two, <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> ordered their buſineſs ſo prudently, as that they were admitted into thoſe Indian habitations as friends, and had free liberty of diſcourſe with them; they were at the firſt a little jealous of them, but by the means of <hi>one-eyed John</hi> (a great Captain of the Indians, that afterwards led them that ſpoiled <hi>Groton,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been a companion of one of the ſaid ſpies, both in hunting, and in fighting againſt the <hi>Mohawks</hi> formerly; ſo eſteemed of him, that he would not ſuffer any of the reſt to touch him) they paſſed through all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian

What might be gathered from the foreſaid premiſes is eaſy to conceive; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon new forces with as much ſpeed as the ſeaſon would allow, were raiſed and ſent up into thoſe parts, under the command of Major <hi>Savage</hi> in chief: They were diſpatched away the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> and appointed to meet with ſuch as ſhould be ſent from <hi>Connecticut</hi> colony, which they did about <hi>Quabaog,</hi> and ſo intended to march directly up to thoſe Indian towns about <hi>Watchuſet-Hill,</hi> to the northweſt; but the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians were gone, and our forces in the purſuit of them taking the wrong path, miſſed of them, yet ranging through thoſe woods, they were at one time ſuddenly aſſaulted by a ſmall party of Indians firing upon them, wounding Mr. <hi>Cerſhom Bulkly,</hi> by a ſhot in his thigh, and killing one of their ſoldiers; after which as they marched along, they accidentally fell upon another ſmall party of the enemy, of whom they ſlew ſome, and took others, to the number of ſixteen, yet could not meet with the main body of the enemy, who it ſeems had paſſed over a great river by rafts, ſo our men could follow them no further, wherefore turning down to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Hadley</hi> and <hi>Northampton,</hi> whither it was ſuppoſed
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:014120_0174_0F9302959846DFD0"/>the Indians intended to paſs, they came very ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to the relief of the ſaid towns, which elſe had been in danger of being loſt. For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> 14th, the enemy fell upon <hi>Northampton,</hi> and in three places broke through the fortification of pali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zadoes, ſet up round about the town a little before for their better ſecurity; but the town being at that time full of ſoldiers, they were quickly repulſed, after they had killed four men and two women, and fired four or five dwelling houſes, and as many barns, with the loſs of many of their lives, as was ſuppoſed.</p>
            <p>WHILE our forces under Major <hi>Savage</hi> continued on that ſide of the country, a ſad accident fell out at <hi>Springfield,</hi> the certainty of which it is judged meet here to relate to prevent miſtakes; the matter having through a great overſight been otherwiſe repreſented than indeed it was, not only to the prejudice of truth, but to the diſadvantage of ſome perſons concerned therein. While the ſoldiers were quartered amongſt the ſeveral towns upon <hi>Connecticut</hi> river, a party of the troop were quartered at a place belonging to <hi>Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> called the <hi>Long-Meadow,</hi> three miles from the town below, toward <hi>Windſor;</hi> ſeveral of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants having moſt of the winter kept from the public meeting on the Lord's days for fear of the enemy, were encouraged to adventure to the aſſembly, on the 26th of <hi>March,</hi> riding in the company of the troopers; but having heard of no Indians thereabouts a good while, were more ſecure than they had cauſe; for rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome of them with women behind them, and ſome with their children in their arms, yet not ſo careful as to keep in the middle, but rather in the rear, and at ſome diſtance ſtragling from the reſt of the company, a party of Indians lying in the buſhes, as they rode along, fired upon the hindmoſt, and killed two, and wounded others: Thoſe in the front having alſo women and maids behind ſome of them, were at a ſtand to know what to do, fearing they might expoſe thoſe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men they had in their company, if they ſhould ride
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:014120_0175_0F93029617841C70"/>back (in that winding road making through a woody place for near a mile or two together) to look after them that were behind; at the laſt, one that came rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, told the foremoſt company there was no hurt, and that they were all coming: They that were before, rode away with all ſpeed to the end of the town, where ſetting down the women, the troopers returned back, but too late to recover two poor women, and two chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who upon the firſt aſſault were thrown off their horſes, and immediately hauled into the buſhes, and through a ſwamp on the other ſide of a ſteep bank, ſo as they could not be heard of all that afternoon, nor the next day till toward night, although they were diligently ſearched after by all the troopers in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the town; at laſt when they were diſcried juſt by a ſwamp ſide, the cruel wretches endeavoured to have killed them all, but in haſte only wounded them with their hatchets, yet ſo as one of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

THE inhabitants of <hi>Sudbury,</hi> with the ſoldiers under Lieut. <hi>Jacobs,</hi> of <hi>Marlborough,</hi> ſufficiently alarmed by the late miſchief done about thoſe towns, reſolved to try what work they could make with the enemy in the night; whereupon going forth <hi>March</hi> 27th, toward morning, they diſcerned where the enemy lay by their fires, (near three hundred of them) and that within half a mile of a garriſon-houſe, near the place where they had done ſo much miſchief the day before. Such was the courage and reſolution of the Engliſh, though but forty in number, townſmen and ſoldiers, that they adventured to diſcharge upon them as they lay by their fires, when it was ſo dark that an Indian could hardly be diſcerned from a better man; yet God ſo directing, they diſcharged ſeveral times upon them, wounded thirty, fourteen of whom either died of their wounds the ſame day, or ſoon after, which had been chief agents in this preſent miſchief againſt the Engliſh. Such was the ſucceſs of this ſkirmiſh that the aſſailants came off without the loſs of one man.</p>
            <p>AFTER this time the enemy began to ſcatter about in ſmall parties, doing what miſchief they could about the <hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> killing a man at <hi>Weymouth,</hi> another at <hi>Hingham,</hi> as they lay ſkulking up and down in ſwamps and holes, to aſſault any that occaſionally look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed never ſo little into the woods; ſometimes alarming the towns about <hi>Boſton,</hi> by diſcharging guns upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons at <hi>Billerica, Braintree,</hi> and at <hi>Wrentham,</hi> near to which place, in the road to <hi>Rehobot,</hi> they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted one <hi>Woodcock</hi>'s houſe, killed one man, and one of his ſons, wounded another, and burnt his ſon's houſe.</p>
            <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the little ſucceſs of former at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, <hi>Philip</hi> and his men have one prize more to play in the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> colony, before they go off the ſtage, and then we ſhall ſoon ſee their power viſibly declining every where, until their final overthrow come upon them. There were ſeveral ſmall parties of them ſcattered up and down all over the country, yet the
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:014120_0177_0F93029AA44FC6C0"/>main body of them was ſtill lurking up and down in thoſe woods that lye between <hi>Brockfield, Marlborough,</hi> and <hi>Connecticut</hi> river. Poſſibly they had ſome hopes of driving all the country before them to the towns upon the ſea-coaſt; for having burnt the deſerted houſes at <hi>Marlborough April</hi> 17th, the next day they ſet upon <hi>Sudbury</hi> with all their might (hoping tis like) to do there as they had done at the towns next beyond it. They did at the firſt prevail ſo far as to conſume ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral houſes and barns, and kill ſeveral perſons, ten or twelve of the Engliſh, that came from <hi>Concord</hi> to aſſiſt their neighbours at <hi>Sudbury,</hi> a town diſtant five miles from them, at the firſt hearing of the alarm, who unawares were ſurprized near a garriſon, in hopes of getting ſome advantage upon a ſmall party of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my that preſented themſelves in a meadow; a great number of Indians that lay unſeen in the buſhes, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly loſe up, and intercepting the paſſage to the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſon houſe, killed and took them all:</p>
            <p>BUT our ſorrows and loſſes that day are not yet come to their height; for in the after part of the ſame day, that reſolute ſtout-hearted ſoldier, Capt. <hi>Wadſworth</hi> (who had not long before, with not above forty men, reſcued <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> when it was in danger to have been all loſt at once) being ſent from <hi>Boſton</hi> with fifty ſoldiers to relieve <hi>Marlborough,</hi> having marched twenty-five miles, and then underſtanding the enemy was gone through the woods toward <hi>Sudbury:</hi> This unwearied company, before ever they had taken any conſiderable reſt, marched immediately back toward <hi>Sudbury</hi> (that lies ten miles nearer <hi>Boſton</hi>) and being come within a mile of the town, they eſpyed a party of Indians not far from them, about an hundred, not more, as they conceived, theſe they might eaſily deal with; who retiring back a while, drew Capt. <hi>Wadſworth</hi> and his company above a mile into the woods, when on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den a great body of the enemy appeared, about five hundred as was thought, who compaſſing them around, forced them to the top of an hill, where they made very ſtout reſiſtance a conſiderable while; but the night
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:014120_0178_0F93029B8737CB28"/>drawing on, and ſome of the company beginning to ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the reſt, their fellows were forced to follow them, ſo as the enemy taking the chace, purſued them on every ſide, as they made too haſty a retreat, by which accident, being ſo much overpowered by the enemy's numbers, they were moſt of them loſt: The Captain himſelf, with one Capt. <hi>Brocklebank</hi> (a choice ſpirited man, much lamented by the town of <hi>Rowley,</hi> to which he belonged) and ſome others that fell into his company as he marched along, ſcarce twenty eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all; ſo as another Captain<note n="‡" place="bottom">His ſon, the late Preſident of Harvard College, e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THUS as in former attempts of like nature too much courage and eagerneſs in purſuit of the enemy, hath added another fatal blow to this poor country.</p>
            <p>THE ſame day another party of the Engliſh coming from <hi>Brookfield,</hi> whither they were ſent as a convoy with proviſion for the garriſon, were in danger likewiſe of falling in the hands of the ſame Indians, yet riding upon a good ſpeed, and keeping their guns always rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy preſented againſt them they met, they never durſt fire at them; only three or four having unadviſedly firſt diſcharged their guns againſt the enemy, and fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much in the rear of their company, were cut off and loſt. It is reported by ſome that afterwards eſcaped, how they cruelly tortured five or ſix of the Engliſh that night: Yet whatever their ſucceſs was this day, it was obſerved by ſome (at that time their priſoners, and ſince releaſed) that they ſeemed very penſive after they came to their quarters, ſhewing no ſuch ſigns of rejoicing as they uſually were wont to do in like caſes; whether for the loſs of ſome of their own company in that day's enterprize (ſaid to be an hundred an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> twenty) or whether it were the Devil in whom
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:014120_0179_0F93029C1974FBA8"/>they truſted, that deceived them, and to whom they made their addreſs the day before, by ſundry conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of their powawes? Or whether it were by any dread that the Almighty ſent upon their ſpirits, upon their execrable blaſphemies, which tis ſaid they uſed in the torturing of ſome of their poor captives (bidding Jeſus come and deliver them out of their hands from death, if he could) we leave as uncertain, though ſome have ſo reported, yet ſure it is that after this day, they never proſpered in any attempt they made againſt the Engliſh, but were continually ſcattered and broken, till they were in a manner all conſumed. After this time, however they had braved it before, they ſeemed to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that it was ſcarce feaſible for them to withſtand the power of the Engliſh, and therefore ſeemed more inclinable to a peace, by ſeveral overtures made by them, if they knew how to have brought it about. For during theſe encounters they were willing to admit of ſome kind of treaty with the Engliſh, about the releaſing of ſundry of their captives, which they took at <hi>Lancaſter</hi> in <hi>February</hi> laſt, and elſewhere: To this end ſundry attempts were made by help of ſeveral of the praying Indians (as they were called) about the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of ſome of the women and children, which were at that time in their poſſeſſion, and by degrees ſomething was effected that way; poſſibly their own preſent ſufferings and wants that were upon them, might induce them thereunto: For by this time the ſpring of the year came on, their proviſion was all ſpent, and they forced to live wholly upon ground nuts, and upon the fleſh of the Engliſh creatures, both horſe and near cattle, which they daily plundered. The ground nuts running up to ſeed in the ſummer, begin to grow ſo ſticky, as they were ſcarce eatable; the fleſh alſo of the Engliſh cattle proving unwholſome for their bodies, filling them with ſundry diſeaſes: One of them having eaten much horſe-fieſh, complained that he had before eaten horſe, and now horſe began to eat him, meaning ſome deadly diſeaſe growing upon his eating ſuch rank fleſh, unwholſome for their bodies, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:014120_0181_0F93029CE229A2D0"/>without falt, as their uſual manner is. The fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeaſon alſo began now to come in, wherein they uſe to take abundance of all ſorts, with which thoſe great rivers up the country are abundantly ſtored; they uſed to take thereof, and drying it in the ſmoke, make proviſion thereof for the greateſt part of the year; and if the war continued, they could not but ſee they ſhould utterly be cut off therefrom; and that if the planting ſeaſon alſo were loſt, they ſhould be in great want of ſummer fruits, <hi>ſc.</hi> beans and ſquaſhes (beſides their corn) with which they were wont to live all the latter part of the ſummer. Upon all conſiderations they ſeemed pretty inclinable to hearken to a peace, though ſome were apt to think they would never have kept it, further than would ſtand with their own advantage, and that their preſent deſire thereof was only to gain time.</p>
            <p>A PERSON formerly acquainted with the Indians about <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> did adventure upon the forementioned overtures, to go amongſt them to try if he could not prevail with them for the redemption of the miniſter's wife, taken captive in <hi>February</hi> laſt, from <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and through the favour of him who having the hearts of all in his hand, inclines them as he pleaſes, obtained the deſired end upon an inconſiderable ſum, which gave encouragement to the council to ſend two meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers on the like errand the ſame week, to procure the redemption of others, not without ſucceſs: The former, viz. Mrs. <hi>Rowlandſon</hi> being brought to <hi>Boſton</hi> upon the election day, <hi>May</hi> 3d, it was generally look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at as a ſmile of providence, and doubtleſs was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of prayer, and anſwer of faith, with which her huſband had been upheld, and ſupported from the day of her captivity; his two children alſo were returned back not long after, more by the over-ruling hand of God (<hi>that turns the captivity of his people as the ſtreams of the ſouth;</hi> and ſometimes inclining them to pity his ſervants, that are of themſelves more cruel than the ſea monſters) than by any other contrivance of man's policy.</p>

               <pb n="151" facs="unknown:014120_0180_0F93029DEC9E7C40"/>
AND yet notwithſtanding motions of this nature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the redemption of ſome of our priſoners ſtill in their hands, there was no ceſſation of arms between us.</p>
            <p>ABOUT this time letters were ſent down from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut</hi> colony, informing the general court then aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled at <hi>Boſton,</hi> that ſome of the <hi>Mohawks</hi> (a ſort of fierce and ſavage Indians, yet mortal enemies to theſe we were at war with) had fallen upon ſome of <hi>Philip</hi>'s party, and deſtroyed many of them: Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that many of them were deſtroyed by fevers and fluxes, with other diſtempers falling amongſt them, which was ſome reviving to our hopes, that the foot of our enemy ſhould ſlide in due time, and that deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was haſtening upon them, though ſtill they were permitted to do miſchief in ſundry particular places of the country, which muſt be minded as we paſs along.</p>
            <p>THOSE Indians that were our profeſſed enemies, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had been beaten out of the <hi>Narrhaganſet</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <hi>February</hi> 1ſt, tarried a while at <hi>Winimazeag,</hi> a place two day's journey north of <hi>Quabaog,</hi> where they divided themſelves into two companies, one of them tarried on that ſide the county, the other made toward <hi>Plimouth</hi> colony, taking <hi>Medfield</hi> in their way, from whence as they marched along they met with a notable repulſe at <hi>Boggiſton,</hi> a ſmall hamlet, or company of farms not far from the ſaid <hi>Medfield,</hi> where they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted a garriſon, but meeting with ſtout reſiſtance, they left the enterprize, and kept on their way toward <hi>Plimouth</hi> colony, where they ſcattered themſelves up and down, waiting for opportunities to ſpoil and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Engliſh plantations on that ſide of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>BESIDES what is already mentioned, on <hi>May</hi> 11th, a party of them aſſaulted the town of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> burnt eleven houſes, and five barns belonging thereunto: On the other ſide, a ſmall party of the Engliſh ſcouting about in purſuit of the Indians, fell upon a party of
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:014120_0182_0F93029E5C94D560"/>them that lay waiting in ambuſh, but being diſcerned by an Indian in the company of our men, that gave timely notice, our ſoldiers had an opportunity thereby to make the firſt ſhot, and thereby not only prevented a miſchief to themſelves, but killed alſo ſome of the enemy (one of whom was obſerved to be of more note than his fellows, by his attire) the reſt fled away from them that purſued, though but a ſmall company; ſo that there were daily reciprocal acts of hoſtility in thoſe parts.</p>
            <p>WITHIN a few days after this, ſeven houſes and two barns more were burnt by the enemy in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Plimouth;</hi> who did the like miſchief about the ſame time to the remaining houſes of <hi>Namaſket</hi> or <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleborough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ABOUT this time another fort of Indians that belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s, both at <hi>Chelmsford</hi> and <hi>Woburn,</hi> to the killing of ſome, and wounding of others, upon ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion that the ſaid Indians were guilty of burning a barn, and hay-ſtack not far off) ſuddenly turned our enemies, after the winter was over; having firſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn themſelves from the place aſſigned them, and where they had been relieved all the winter (ſome of them after a former revolt) and took their opportunity to fire Mr. <hi>Falconer</hi>'s houſe in <hi>Andover</hi> town, early that ſpring, and wounded one <hi>Roger Marks,</hi> and killed his horſe. Two more houſes about <hi>Shawſkin,</hi> beyond the ſaid <hi>Andover,</hi> were burnt about <hi>March</hi> 10th: Alſo they killed a young man of the ſaid town, <hi>April</hi> 8th, the ſon of <hi>George Abbot;</hi> and another ſon of his alſo was carried away the ſame day, who notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was returned ſome few months after, almoſt pined to death with hunger.</p>
            <p>AT the ſame time they killed ſome of their cattle, cutting out only the tongues of ſome of them for haſte,
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:014120_0183_0F93029F290A5CE8"/>being ſhot at by ſeveral of the inhabitants from their garriſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> 10th, at <hi>Concord</hi> two men going for hay, one of them was killed. At <hi>Chelmsford,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Wameſit</hi> Indians, about <hi>March</hi> 18th before, fell upon ſome houſes on the north ſide of the river; burnt down three or four that belonged to the family of <hi>Edward Colburn:</hi> The ſaid <hi>Colburn,</hi> with <hi>Samuel Varnham,</hi> his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, being purſued, as they paſſed over the river to look after their cattle on that ſide of the river; and making ſeveral ſhote againſt them, who returned the like again upon the ſaid Indians, (judged to be about forty) what ſucceſs they had upon the enemy, was beſt known to themſelves; but two of <hi>Varnham</hi>'s ſons were ſlain by the enemy's ſhot before they could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the other ſide of the river. <hi>April</hi> 15th alſo, were fourteen or fifteen houſes burnt there.</p>
            <p>NOT long before this, <hi>February</hi> 1ſt, 1676, <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Eames</hi> that kept a farm at <hi>Sudbury,</hi> whoſe dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was three or four miles out of town, had his houſe aſſaulted and fired, his wife killed, and his children carried captive among the Indians.</p>
            <p>ALSO two men were killed at a farm about <hi>Concord, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob Shepard</hi> by name, about the middle of <hi>February,</hi> and a young maid that was ſet to watch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a hill, of about fifteen years of age, was carried captive, who ſtrangely eſcaped away upon an horſe that the Indians had taken from <hi>Lancaſter</hi> a little before. In the like ſtrange manner did one of <hi>Eames</hi>'s children eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape away about <hi>May</hi> 3d laſt, travelling thirty miles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in the woods, without any relief till he came to an Engliſh town. <hi>Eames</hi>'s houſe was aſſaulted when he was from home, by an Indian called <hi>Netus</hi> (not long after ſlain at <hi>Marlborough</hi>) which had been very famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar with the Engliſh, with nine or ten more of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, as perfidious and barbarous as himſelf. They burned all the dwellings that belonged to the farm, corn, hay and cattle, beſides the dwelling-houſe with
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:014120_0184_0F93029FDC574F60"/>what was therein; it is probable thoſe at <hi>Concord</hi> were killed by the ſame hands about a fortnight after.</p>
            <p>MANY ſuch-like remarkable inſtances of ſpecial providences might be mentioned, if it were convenient to inſert ſuch particular paſſages into the general narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the late troubles with our barbarous enemies.</p>
            <p>ON <hi>May</hi> 3d a party of them killed a man at <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verhill,</hi> upon the edge of <hi>Merrimack-River,</hi> and paſſing over the ſaid River to <hi>Bradford,</hi> ſpoiled another fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, killing one <hi>Thomas Kimball,</hi> and carrying his wife and five children captive, forty miles up in the woods; although it was queſtioned whether this laſt miſchief was done by any of <hi>Philip</hi>'s party, but rather by ſome that belonged to the Eaſtward Indians, of which there may be occaſion, God willing, to ſpeak more of afterward.</p>
            <p>FOR the ſuppreſſing of theſe inſolencies ſeveral com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of freſh ſoldiers both horſe and foot were raiſed in the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> by the governor and council of that colony, and ſent out to ſuppreſs the common enemy; the foot under the command of the Captains <hi>Sill, Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> and <hi>Holbrook;</hi> the horſe under the command of the Captains <hi>Brattle, Prentice</hi> and <hi>Henchman,</hi> the laſt of which was commander in chief. Theſe ſeveral com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies modelled as aforeſaid, were ſent out <hi>April</hi> 27th, 1676, to range the woods towards <hi>Haſſanemeſit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE 6th of <hi>May</hi> they met with a conſiderable party of the enemy; they were firſt diſcovered by the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> ſcouts purſuing a bear, and at the firſt not diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the <hi>Natick</hi> Indian ſcouts belonged to our men, it gave ſome advantage to our forces; our horſemen falling upon them before they were aware, killed and took of the enemy about 16, which they took no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of at the preſent, altho' it was confeſſed by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they loſt 20 in that encounter. It was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported that the ſounding of a trumpet without order did much hurt, but the commander in chief affirmeth that it was no diſadvantage to the ſervice in hand, it
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:014120_0185_0F9302A09D43DA10"/>neither being heard by our own foot, nor yet by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. If any error was committed by the Engliſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, it was that the horſe did not timely enough draw down from the top of the hill, whereby they came to be diſcovered by the enemy, who thereupon made the more haſte to eſcape; however, it was no ſmall loſs to the enemy, ſome of the ſlain being known to be conſiderable perſons; and it ſtruck ſuch a terror in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that they never durſt face our men afterwards; for although after our men returned to their quarters at <hi>Medfield,</hi> they ſaw 200 fires in the night, yet they could never come near them again to fight any company of them; but the ſeaſon proving rainy hindred any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purſuit of them at that time. And ſoon after this the ſoldiers being viſited with ſickly diſtempers by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of an epidemical cold at that time prevailing thro' the country, they were for the preſent releaſed for the recovery of their health, with intent to be called toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther again at a more convenient time; this was done the 10th of <hi>May.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>DURING this interval of time, upon a report that a party of the enemy that were diſcovered about <hi>Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both,</hi> buſy in fiſhing in a river thereabouts, Captain <hi>Brattle</hi> was ſent up about the 23d of <hi>May,</hi> who with the help of ſome of the inhabitants, killed 11 or 12 of them, without the loſs of but one of our men. Had they not diſcovered ſome of our's on. the oppoſite ſhore, it was conceived a greater ſpoil might have been made amongſt them.</p>
            <p>BUT in the next place we muſt take notice of the proceedings of the enemy about <hi>Connecticut.</hi> The greateſt body of them made towards <hi>Plimouth</hi> colony early in the ſpring, as was ſaid before, where we ſhall leave them for the preſent, and obſerve what the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part of them did weſtward.</p>
            <p>SOME ſcattering parties were ſkulking about <hi>Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> and thoſe lower towns, upon a ſmall number of whom Capt. <hi>Holyoke</hi> (newly choſen Captain of <hi>Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi>
               <pb n="156" facs="unknown:014120_0186_0F9302A159FAFC58"/>in the room of his father lately deceaſed) hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled his office early in the ſpring; for having notice of ſome of them in thoſe woods, he marched after them with 10 or 12 reſolute young men, and waiting his opportunity, ſurprized them near the great river, ſo as two or three of them were left dead upon the place, another mortally wounded got on an iſland in the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, where it was concluded he took his laſt night's lodging. The other being ſorely wounded was taken alive and brought home to <hi>Springfield,</hi> where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed many things to one of the Inhabitants that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood their language, owning the truth in many things againſt his own company, and ſoon after died of his wounds.</p>
            <p>THIS was but a preparative to an higher piece of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which Capt. <hi>Holyoke</hi> was ſoon after engaged in, and wherein he acquitted himſelf beyond expectation, and taking more pains than ordinary in making his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, he got a ſurfeit, which ended his days the <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> following, near <hi>Boſton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ABOUT the beginning of <hi>April</hi> likewiſe, ſome of the inhabitants about <hi>Hadley,</hi> attending their tillage at <hi>Hockanum,</hi> within three miles of the town, and having a guard of ſoldiers with them, yet three of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany were caſually ſlain by a party of the enemy that lay in wait for ſuch an opportunity. One of them was Mr. <hi>Goodman,</hi> a deacon of the church, that went a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle beyond the command of the ſoldiers that came to guard them, to view the fence of his own land, and two others, that contrary to expreſs orders would ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon the top of an high hill near by, to take a needleſs and unſeaſonable view of the country, were ſhot down by the enemy before they could recover their corps-du-guard.</p>
            <p>BUT the great company of the enemy that ſtayed on that ſide of the country, and about <hi>Watchuſet</hi>-hills, when the reſt went towards <hi>Plimouth,</hi> though they had been diſappointed in their planting by the death of
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:014120_0187_0F9302A21A67CFB8"/>
               <hi>Canonchet,</hi> were 10th to loſe the advantage of the fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeaſon then coming in; wherefore, having ſeated themſelves near the upper falls of <hi>Connecticut</hi> river, not far from <hi>Deerfield,</hi> and perceiving that the Engliſh for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were now drawn off from the lower towns of <hi>Had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> and <hi>Northampton</hi> now and then took advantages to plunder them of their cattle, and not ſearing any aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault from our ſoldiers, grew a little ſecure, while they were upon their fiſhing deſign, inſomuch that a couple of Engliſh lads lately taken captive by the enemy, and making their eſcape, acquainted their friends at home how ſecure they lay in thoſe places, which ſo animated the inhabitants of <hi>Hadley, Hatfield</hi> and <hi>Northampton,</hi> that they being willing to be revenged for the loſs of their cattle, beſides other preceeding miſchiefs, took up a reſolution with what ſtrength they could raiſe among themſelves (partly out of garriſon ſoldiers, and partly of the inhabitants) to make an aſſault upon them, which if it had been done with a little more delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, waiting for the coming of ſupplies, expected from <hi>Hartford,</hi> might have proved a fatal buſineſs to all the ſaid Indians; yet was the victory obtained more conſiderable than at firſt was apprehended; for not having much above an hundred and fifty fighting men in their company, they marched above twenty miles ſilently in the dead of the night, <hi>May</hi> 18th, and came upon the ſaid Indians a little before break of day, whom they found almoſt in a dead ſleep, without any ſcouts abroad, or watching about their wigwams at home; for in the evening they had made themſelves merry with new milk and roaſt beef, having lately driven away many of their milch cows, as an Engliſh woman confeſſed, that was made to milk-them.</p>
            <p>WHEN they came near the Indians rendezvous, they alighted off their horſes, and tied them to ſome young trees at a quarter of a miles diſtance, ſo marching up, they fired briſkly into their wigwams, killing many up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the place, and frighting others with the ſudden a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm of their guns, and made them run into the river,
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:014120_0188_0F9302A2D66A5B88"/>where the ſwiftneſs of the ſtream carrying them down a ſteep full, they periſhed in the waters, ſome getting into canoes (ſmall boats made of the barks of birchen trees) which proved to them a <hi>Charon</hi>'s boat, being ſunk, or overſet by the ſhooting of our men, delivered them into the like danger of the waters, giving them thereby a paſport into the other world; Others of them creeping for ſhelter under the banks of the great river, were eſpyed by our men and killed with their ſwords; Capt. <hi>Holyoke</hi> killing five, young and old, with his own hands, from under a bank. When the Indians were firſt awakened with the thunder of their guns, they cried out <hi>Mohawks, Mohawks,</hi> as if their own native enemies had been upon them; but the dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the light ſoon notified their error, though it could not prevent the danger.</p>
            <p>SUCH as came back ſpake ſparingly of the number ſlain; ſome ſay there could not in reaſon be leſs than two or three hundred of them that muſt neceſſarily pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in the midſt of ſo many inſtruments of deſtruction managed againſt them with ſuch diſadvantages to themſelves. Some of their priſoners afterwards owned that they loſt above 300 in that camiſado, ſome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were principal men Sachems, and ſome of their beſt fighting men that were left, which made the victory more conſiderable than elſe it would have been; nor did they ſeem ever to have recovered themſelves after this defeat, but their ruin immediately followed upon it.<note n="*" place="bottom">There was but one of our men killed in the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; their loſs following was owing to the report of a captive taken, who ſaid <hi>Philip</hi> was near with 1000 men; word was then given for every man to ſhift for himſelf; a panic ſeized the men, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly fled in confuſion.</note> Yet ſuch was the awful hand of Providence in the cloſe of this victory, mixing much bitter with the ſweet, that it might well be called a coſtly victory to the conquerors, that ſo no fleſh ſhould glory in itſelf.</p>
            <p>THE Indians that lay ſcattering on both ſides of the river, after they recovered themſelves and diſcovered
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:014120_0189_0F9302A3FAC9CE00"/>the ſmall number of them that aſſailed them, turned head upon the Engliſh, who in their retreat were a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diſordered for want of the help of the eldeſt Captain that was ſo enfeebled by ſickneſs before he ſet out, that he was no way able for want of bodily ſtrength (not any way defective for want of ſkill or courage) to aſſiſt or direct in making the retreat: For ſome of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my fell upon the guards that kept the horſes, others purſued them in the rear, ſo as our men ſuſtained very much damage as they retired, miſſing after their return thirty-eight of their men; and if Capt <hi>Holyoke</hi> had not played the man at a more than ordinary rate, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the front, ſometimes in the ſlank and rear, at all times encouraging the ſoldiers, it might have proved a fatal buſineſs to the aſſailants. The ſaid Capt. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycke</hi>'s horſe was ſhot down under him, and himſelf ready to be aſſaulted by many of the Indians, juſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him, but diſcharging his piſtols upon one or two of them, whom he preſently diſpatched, and a friend coming up to his reſcue, he was ſaved, and ſo carried off the ſoldiers without any further loſs. It is confidently reported by ſome that were there preſent at this engagement, that one told above an hundred Indians left dead upon the place; and another affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he told near an hundred and forty ſwimming down the falls, none of which were obſerved to get alive to the ſhore, ſave one. The loſs that befel our men in the retreat was occaſioned principally by the bodily weakneſs of Capt. <hi>Turner,</hi> unable to manage his charge any longer, yet ſome ſay they wanted powder, which forced them to retire as faſt as they could by Capt. <hi>Turner</hi>'s order. It is alſo ſaid by one preſent at the fight, that ſeven or eight in the rear of the Engliſh, through haſte, miſſed their way, it being a cloudy dark morning, and were never heard of again; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt fell into the Indians hands, and it is feared ſome of them were tortured. About ſeven days after this they had a mind to try the chance of war again, and ſee if they could not recover their loſs by return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the like upon the Engliſh: For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 30th, a great number of them (ſuppoſed to be
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:014120_0190_0F9302A4845E54F8"/>ſix or ſeven hundred) appeared before <hi>Hatfield,</hi> fired about twelve houſes and barns without the fortification of the town; a number of houſes in the centre of the town were ſurrounded with paliſadoes; theſe were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked in the day time, when the men were all out in the fields, except one aged man; they drove away multitudes of their cattle and ſheep, ſpreading them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the meadow near the town; which bravado ſo raiſed the courage of their neighbours at <hi>Hadley,</hi> that twenty-five reſolute young men ventured over the river to relieve <hi>Hatfield</hi> in this diſtreſs, who charged the enemy with ſuch undaunted courage and reſolution (<hi>Audaces fortuna juvat</hi>) that they beat down five or ſix at the firſt ſhot they made; ſo making way through the thickeſt of their enemies, that lay ready to take aim at them behind every tree as they paſſed by; yet they eſcaped all their ſhot till they came within a little of the town they came to relieve, where they loſt five of their number.</p>
            <p>THE enemy being amazed at the reſolution of our men, being but ſo ſmall a handful, that they fled im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from the town; having loſt twenty-five of their men in the enterprize. The council of the <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſets</hi> gathering by theſe proceedings of the Indians, that their deſire of peace was only to gain time, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the forces raiſed before <hi>April</hi> 27th, and for a time releaſed, ſhould be haſtened out again to range the woods towards <hi>Hadley,</hi> and thoſe parts, made an agreement with <hi>Hartford</hi> colony to ſend forces from thence to meet them about <hi>Brookfield,</hi> and ſo to ſcour along on both ſides <hi>Connecticut,</hi> to diſreſt the enemy what they could, and keep them from fiſhing in thoſe waters, their hope of planting being now almoſt over. To this end, about <hi>May</hi> 30th, 1676, the forces under Capt. <hi>Henchman</hi> were called together again, and ſent to <hi>Brookfield,</hi> to meet with thoſe expected from <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> colony; in the way, our's by the direction of <hi>Tom Doublet</hi> (a <hi>Natick</hi> Indian, who was a little before em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the redemption of captives) following tracks of Indians, came upon a party of the enemy fiſhing in

            <p>IT plainly appears by the contents of the ſaid letter, as well as by many other teſtimonies, that about this time the Indians, our enemies, who hitherto had been li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="163" facs="unknown:014120_0193_0F9302AB12EF1F48"/>them by the <hi>Mohawks,</hi> who falling upon <hi>Philip</hi> with the inland Indians, ſlew about 50 of them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon thoſe of <hi>Philip</hi>'s company reſolved to return to their own country, and do what miſchief they could to the Engliſh thereabouts. This was reported by an Indian brought to <hi>Seaconk, June</hi> 29, 1676, taken at <hi>Providence.</hi> Others are ready to think that it was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome quarrel amongſt themſelves, occaſioned by an evil ſpirit ſent from God upon them, that thereby they might, being ſcattered, the more eaſily be taken and ruined by the Engliſh, now that the time of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance was come, when they ſhall be called to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for all their former outrages and cruelties; for now is the ſnare haſtening upon them wherein they ſhall be hampered in their own devices, ſo to be taken and deſtroyed. It cannot but be acknowledged as a very remarkable providence, that Capt. <hi>Henchman</hi> in his late expedition to <hi>Hadley,</hi> killed and took about 84 of the enemy, without the loſs of any one of his own men; the like favorable ſucceſs happened to Major <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot</hi> in his paſſage from <hi>Norwich</hi> to <hi>Quabaog,</hi> as was ſaid before, and ſoon after his return.</p>
            <p>BUT by that time our forces were returned home as far as <hi>Sudbury;</hi> they were ordered upon the ſolicitation of the Governor of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> two companies of them at leaſt, to march away immediately to <hi>Dedham,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Seaconk</hi> or <hi>Rehoboth,</hi> to join Major <hi>Bradford</hi> in the purſuit of <hi>Philip,</hi> who was it ſeems with many hundreds of his barbarous followers fallen upon the Engliſh plantations thereabouts, and whither alſo a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before, Capt. <hi>Brattle</hi> with a troop of horſe, and Capt. <hi>Moſely</hi> with a company of foot, were ſent up from <hi>Boſton</hi> to purſue after them, now flocking in great numbers in thoſe woods. There was at this time no ſmall hopes of ſurprizing <hi>Philip;</hi> ſeveral reports being brought that he was ſeen in this and that place, not having above 20 or 30 men attending on him; but his time was not yet fully come, nor had he as yet ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accompliſhed all that miſchief he was like to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to do: For on the 1ſt of <hi>July,</hi> 1676, a party of
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:014120_0194_0F9799FF5B62ECE0"/>his Indians committed a horrid and barbarous murder upon Mr. <hi>Hezekiab Willet,</hi> of <hi>Swanzey,</hi> an hopeful young gentleman as any in thoſe parts. They uſed frequently to keep a ſentinel on the top of their houſe from a watch-houſe built thereon, whence they could diſcover any Indians before they came near the houſe, but not hearing of the enemy in thoſe parts for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time, that neceſſary piece of circumſpection was omitted that day, whereby that deſerving perſon was betrayed into their cruel hands; for within a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour after he went out of his own door, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in fight of his houſe, he was ſhot at by three of them at once, from every one of whom he received a mortal wound; they after their barbarous manner took off his head, and carried it away with them (which however was ſoon after recovered) leaving the trunk of his body behind, as a ſad monument of their inhuman cruelty. The ſame Indians, not being above 30 in number, took away a negro belonging to the ſame family, who being faithful to his maſter's and the country's intereſt, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured his life to make his eſcape, which was the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of many others; for the ſaid negro being a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle acquainted with their language, diſcovered to the Engliſh after his eſcape, <hi>Philip</hi>'s purpoſe to ſeize ſuch and ſuch places: In the firſt place to aſſault <hi>Taunton,</hi> which in all probability had been in great danger, if their treacherous plots and purpoſes had not ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully been made known beforehand. The ſaid negro affirmed, that there was near a thouſand of them; for he obſerved that altho' they had killed 20 head of neat cattle over night, yet there was not any part of them left the next day at eight o'clock in the morning. By this ſpecial providence the enemy was defeated of their purpoſe, and never after had an opportunity of doing any conſiderable damage to the Engliſh in that part of the country. So, after this day, we may truely date the time of our deliverance, and beginning of revenges upon the enemy; now is their own turn come, when it ſhall be done unto them as they have done unto us; they that before led others into captivity, muſt hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth go into captivity themſelves; and they that kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:014120_0195_0F9302AB4D96D9F0"/>with the ſword, muſt themſelves be killed with the ſword, as in the ſequel of this narrative will abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be manifeſt; the hiſtory of which before we ſhall any further purſue, we muſt a little while wait upon our friends, (thoſe forces ſent from <hi>Connecticut</hi>) in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn back into their own colony, which before it be done, ſome things ſhould be premiſed concerning the occaſion of their coming, and the ſucceſs that did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them in their march thither.</p>
            <p>OUR friends and brethren of that colony, although they had never actually felt half of thoſe miſeries that befel the people of the other two, yet never denyed their aſſiſtance to the ſuppreſſing of the common enemy, yea, ſometimes they did afford it, before it was expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſired, according to the tenor of the articles of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation and rules of common prudence; conſidering that if the fire of this war was not timely extinguiſhed it would endanger their own ſabrick; therefore accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to agreement, the council of that colony ordered their ſucceſsful commander, Major <hi>Talcot,</hi> to meet our forces at <hi>Quabaog,</hi> or <hi>Brookfield,</hi> in order to the purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the enemy in thoſe parts. In the way as they were marching from <hi>Norwich</hi> thither, divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſo far ſmiled upon the enterprize, as to give them an opportunity to ſurprize 51 of the enemy, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> whom 19 were ſlain, without the loſs of any one of their own company, which could not but much enhance the price of the victory to the conquerors.</p>
            <p>THE like ſucceſs had their friends which they left behind (the volunteers gathered out of the three towns by the ſea-ſide, <hi>New-London, Stonington</hi> and <hi>Norwich</hi>) and who were ſome of them releaſed by Major <hi>Talcot,</hi> when he firſt began his march, that they might the better in the abſence of the army guard their own towns; for before the return of the forces under Maj. <hi>Talcot</hi> to that ſide of the country, they had made two expeditions againſt their enemies, the <hi>Narrhaganſets,</hi> that were ſkulking up and down on that ſide of the country, in one of which they killed and took above
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:014120_0196_0F9302AC5DFB3B60"/>30, the moſt of which being men, are ſaid to have been ſlain by them. In the other 45, the moſt of which probably were women and children, but being all young ſerpents of the ſame brood, the ſubduing or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſo many, ought to be acknowledged as another ſignal victory and pledge of divine favor to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh. But to return, It was not without the ſpecial direction of Providence that thoſe <hi>Hartford</hi> forces were ſent to thoſe weſtern towns a week before thoſe of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> could get thither; for otherwiſe one or more of thoſe towns might have been loſt; ſeeing that on the 12th of <hi>June,</hi> ſoon after if not the next day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they arrived there, the enemy, as if reſolved to try the utmoſt of their power, violently aſſaulted the town of <hi>Hadley,</hi> with a body of about 700 men, at five or ſix o'clock in the morning, laying an ambuſh at one end of the town, while the greater part of them were alarming the other; but the <hi>Connecticut</hi> forces being at that time quartered in the towns thereabous, (who were Engliſh, and friendly Indians. <hi>Pequods</hi> and <hi>Mohegins,</hi> about 500 in all) that were ready at hand, beſides thoſe that had been quartered there ever ſince <hi>March,</hi> who had been left by Major <hi>Savage</hi> when he left thoſe parts, under the command and charge of Capt. <hi>Turner,</hi> ſlain at the great falls, as is noted before, but ſince commanded by Capt. <hi>Swain.</hi> Theſe by their joint and ready aſſiſtance, wherein the fence of paliſadoes ſurrounding the town was no little advantage, gave the Indians ſuch a ſmart repulſe, that they found the place too hot for them to abide it; for the ſoldiers or townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men within, firing a piece of ordnance, ſo affrighted the ſavages, or a party of them againſt whom it was diſcharged, that although they had juſt before ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and poſſeſſed an houſe at the north part of the town, yet they inſtantly fled, leaving ſome of their dead upon the place; nor did they any conſiderable miſchief with all their numbers, ſave firing a barn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that end of the town, and killing two or three of the ſoldiers, or too daring inhabitants, who would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt expreſs order, venture to go without the fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>

               <pb n="167" facs="unknown:014120_0197_0F9302AE481FDD50"/>
IT was accounted by ſome that were preſent near the time of that aſſault, a great overſight, that having ſo fair an opportunity to chace the enemy upon ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable advantage, it was let ſlip, and not improved, for <hi>Connecticut</hi> ſoldiers being all, or moſt of them fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with horſes, they might have been ſoon overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and many of them deſtroyed, but God hid it from their eyes. The commander in chief, it is ſaid, quartered at one end of the towns (<hi>Hatfield</hi> was then within the limits of <hi>Hadley</hi>) on the weſt ſide of the river, and did not apprehend the advantage till the ſeaſon was over; hor was any ſuch thing as an aſſault expected from the enemy ſo early in the morning; it being a general obſervation heretofore, that they ſeldom or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver uſed to make any attempts in the night; part of which could not but be improved in way of preparation for ſuch a deſign. But the Lord of Hoſts who is wiſe in council, and wonderful in working, will find ſome other way to deſtroy our enemies, wherein the hand of his providence ſhould more remarkably be ſeen, that ſo no fleſh ſhould glory in its own wiſdom or ſtrength, but that ſalvation might appear to be from the Lord alone. The reſt of this month was ſpent without any other matter of moment happening therein.</p>
            <p>THE Governor and Council of the <hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into ſerious conſideration the many merciful oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences that had been returned upon us, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mixing of many diſpenſations of a contrary nature, thought themſelves bound to make ſome pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic acknowledgment thereof, to him whoſe name alone is worthy to be praiſed. The 29th of <hi>June</hi> was ſet apart as a day of public thankſgiving to God, who had remembered his people thus in their low eſtate. And that matter of thankſgiving might not be wanting at the day appointed, the very day before were moſt of our Engliſh captives brought back from the Indians, and many more ſoon after, to the number of ſixteen, whoſe mouths might then well be filled with <hi>laughter,</hi> and their <hi>tong<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

AND as this day appointed for ſolemn and public thankſgiving, was uſhered in by ſeveral ſpecial mercies, ſo alſo was it followed with many remarkable benefits. For beſides the preſerving the town of <hi>Northampton, March</hi> the 14th, and <hi>Hadley, June</hi> the 12th, by the timely ſending of our forces the very night before they were aſſaulted; the ſaving the people of <hi>Marlborough</hi> from being cut off, was very obſervable; when Mr. <hi>Graves</hi> by occaſionally going from the ſermon with the extremity of the tooth-ach, <hi>March</hi> 26th, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Indians ready to aſſault the town, and the people might have been cut off, had not that accident happened. It is certain that after the end of this month, the power of the enemy began every where to fail; for the body of the enemy that had lurked about <hi>Connecticut</hi> river all this ſpring, being viſited with ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry diſeaſes, diſappointed of their fiſhing, and put by their planting, began to be at variance amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; the <hi>Hadley</hi> and <hi>Pocumtuck</hi> (now <hi>Deerfield</hi>) In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians quarreling with <hi>Philip</hi> for bringing all this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief about, and occaſioning the Engliſh and them to fall out, with whom they had always good correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence, and lived lovingly together, but now they were like to be runied by the war. This quarrel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to that height, that from that time forward, thoſe ſeveral Indians that had for ſo long time been combined together, reſolved now to part, and every one to ſhift for themſelves, and return to their own homes; <hi>Philip</hi> to <hi>Mount-Hope,</hi> and the <hi>Narrhaganſets</hi> to their own country again; the <hi>Nipnet</hi>'s and the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Indians bending their courſe weſtward, others northward, towards <hi>Pennicock,</hi> upon <hi>Merrimack,</hi> intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſhift for themſelves as well as they could for the future; all which is like to be the real and true ſtate of the caſe with the Indians which were our enemies; for the next news we heard of <hi>Philip,</hi> was that he had returned back to <hi>Mount-Hope,</hi> now like to become <hi>Mount-Miſery</hi> unto him and his vagabond crew, and that his friends and allies that had hitherto ſtood as neuters, waiting only which way the ſcale of ſucceſs and victory would turn, began now to ſue for mercy
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:014120_0199_0F9302AFA1D842C8"/>at the hands of the Engliſh: The <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment having underſtood ſomething of this nature, put forth a declaration, that whatſoever Indians ſhould within fourteen days next enſuing, come in to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, might hope for mercy. Amongſt ſundry that came in, there was one named <hi>James,</hi> the printer, the ſupperadded title diſtinguiſhing him from others of that name; who being a notorious apoſtate, that had learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much of the Engliſh as not only to read and write, but had attained likewiſe ſome ſkill in printing, and might have attained more (had he not like a falſe villian ran away from his maſter before his time was out) he having ſeen and read the ſaid declaration of the Engliſh, did venture himſelf upon the faith thereof, and came to ſue for his life; he affirmed, with others that came along with him, that more Indians had died ſince this war began, of diſeaſes (ſuch as at other times they uſed not to be acquainted with) than by the ſword of the Engliſh.</p>
            <p>NOT long after many of them came and offered themſelves, to the number of near two hundred, men, women, and children; and many more would have done the like, but their conſciouſneſs of guilt made them conclude that their cruelties and barbarous mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders could never be forgiven by the Engliſh. But what occurrences happened next ſhall be declared in their order. About the end of <hi>June</hi> news was brought to <hi>Boſton</hi> that <hi>Philip</hi> with a ſmall party of his men lurked about <hi>Swanzey</hi> or <hi>Rehoboth,</hi> and that he might eaſily be taken; an Indian offering to bring them to the place where they might find him; whereupon ſoldiers were inſtantly ſent away from <hi>Boſton,</hi> who ſpent ſome time in ſcarching all the woods on that ſide of the country, but at laſt were forced to return, having miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of what they aimed at. <hi>Plymouth</hi> colony likewiſe ſent out ſoldiers upon the ſame account, under Major <hi>Bradford,</hi> who by the help of ſome Indians of <hi>Cape-God,</hi> always true to the Engliſh intereſt, not only eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped an ambuſh laid for them, whereby moſt of them
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:014120_0200_0F9302B06DB45140"/>might have been cut off, but ſlew many of thoſe that laid in wait for them, without any loſs to themſelves; yea further, a ſquaw Sachem of <hi>Seaconet,</hi> one of <hi>Philip</hi>'s allies, having firſt ſent three meſſengers to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> to ſue for life and liberty, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſing ſubmiſſion to their government on that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; but underſtanding that <hi>Plimouth</hi> forces were abroad, before her meſſengers returned, ſhe with her people, about ninety in number, rendered themſelves up to Major <hi>Bradford,</hi> ſo that above one hundred and ten, on a moderate computation, were killed that day.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Connecticut</hi> forces had the like ſucceſs when ſent into <hi>Narrhaganſet</hi> country, under the command of the wonderfully ſucceſsful Major <hi>Talcot,</hi> Capt. <hi>George Deniſon,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Newbury,</hi> with other worthy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of the ſaid forces: For, on the 2d of <hi>July,</hi> 1676, as the ſaid commanders with the forces under them were purſuing the enemy in and about the <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhaganſet</hi> country towards <hi>Mount-Hope,</hi> hearing that <hi>Philip</hi> with his black regiment of <hi>Wampanoogs</hi> was thereabouts, their Indian ſcouts from the top of an hill diſcovered a great number of the enemy that had new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pitched their ſtation within the ſemicircle of a ſwamp. The Engliſh ſoldiers were all mounted on horſe-back, to the number of three hundred; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the commanders ordered the Indians to be ready at the top of a hill, upon a ſignal given to run down ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly upon the enemy, who were ſecurely lodged in the hallow of a ſwamp juſt oppoſite them, while the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men being divided into two ſquadrons, to ride round the hill, ſo that at the ſame inſtant both the horſemen upon the two wings, and the Indians a foot ruſhing down ſuddenly upon the enemy, put them into a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fright, making a lamentable outcry, ſome getting into the ſwamp, the reſt that were prevented by the horſemen and the friendly Indians coming ſo ſuddenly upon them, were all taken priſoners; Capt. <hi>Newbury</hi> with his troop alighting from their horſes ran into the ſwamp after them, where they killed at leaſt an hundred, as was judged by ſome then preſent, taking alſo many
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:014120_0201_0F9302B13689CEA8"/>priſoners out of thoſe habitations of darkneſs, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſcarce daring to make any reſiſtance; for none of the Engliſh, and but one or two of the <hi>Mohegins</hi> and <hi>Pequods</hi> were hurt in the aſſault: yet it was affirmed by a captain preſent on the place, that with thoſe they killed and took at <hi>Warwick</hi> neck in their return home, (which were not above ſixty) that they killed and took of the enemy at that time above 300 young and old. At the ſame time was taken the old ſquaw of <hi>Narrhaganſet,</hi> commonly called the old queen.</p>
            <p>THEY were neceſſitated with this booty to return homewards to gratify the <hi>Mohegin</hi> and <hi>Pequod</hi> Indians that cccompanied them, who had done them very good ſervice in the purſuit, having loſt one or two of their men in the chace; but their return home was, as it proved in the iſſue, more beneficial than their longer ſtay might have been, to have made a fruitleſs purſuit after <hi>Philip,</hi> (whoſe time was not yet come, although haſtening apace) for in their return they met 60 of the enemy, all of whom they ſlew and took, ſo as their ſword returned not empty.</p>
            <p>AMONG the priſoners then taken was a ſprightly young fellow, ſeized by the <hi>Mohegins,</hi> who deſired of the Engliſh commanders that he might be delivered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands, that they might put him to death in their <hi>own way,</hi> and ſacrifice him to their cruel genius of revenge, in which bruitiſh and deviliſh paſſion they moſt of all delighted in. The Engliſh, tho' not delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in blood, yet at this time were not unwilling to gratify their humour, leſt by a denial they might diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige their Indian friends, of whom they lately made ſo much uſe; partly alſo that they might have an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular demonſtration of the ſavage barbarous cruelty of the heathen. And indeed, of all the enemies that have been the ſubjects of the preceeding narrative, this vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain did moſt deſerve to become an object of juſtice and ſeverity; for he boldly told them that he had with his gun diſpatched 19 Engliſh, and that he had charged it for the 20th, but not meeting with another, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:014120_0202_0F9302B1DC769348"/>to loſe a fair ſhot, he let fly at a <hi>Moghegin</hi> and killed him; with which having compleated his num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber he was fully ſatisfied. But, as is uſually ſaid, juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice vindictive hath iron hands, though leaden feet; this cruel monſter is fallen into the hands of thoſe that will repay him ſeven fold. In the firſt place therefore, making a great circle, they placed him in the middle that all their eyes might at the ſame time be pleaſed with utmoſt revenge upon him; they firſt cut one of his fingers round in the joint, at the trunk of his hand with a ſharp knife, and then broke it off, as was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly the cuſtom to do with a ſlaughtered beaſt before he is uncaſed; then they cut off another, and another after that, till they had finally diſmembered one hand of all its digits, the blood ſometimes ſpirting out in ſtreams a yard from his hand; which barbarous and unheard of cruelty the Engliſh were not able to bear, it forcing tears from their eyes; yet did not the unhappy victim ever relent, or ſhew any ſigns of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh; for, being aſked by his tormentors how he liked the war? he replied, he liked it very well, and found it as ſweet as Engliſhmen did their ſugar. In this frame he continued till his executioners had dealt with the toes of his feet as they had done with the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of his hands before; all the time making him dance round the circle, and ſing till he had wearied both himſelf and them At laſt they broke the bones of his legs, after which he was forced to ſit down, which 'tis ſaid he ſilently did, till they knocked out his brains.</p>
            <p>WITHIN a few days after, 200 of the enemy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Plimouth</hi> juriſdiction being diſtreſſed with famine and fear of danger, came and ſubmitted themſelves to the government there; but three of the company were preſently detected of a cruel murder, and villainous aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault upon one Mr. <hi>Clarke</hi>'s houſe of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> by a well-minded ſquaw that was among them (hoping that poſſibly ſuch a diſcovery would be pleaſing to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh) and accordingly adjudged forthwith to undergo condign puniſhment, which the reſt that ſurrendered themſelves, did not in the leaſt reſent; ſuch kind of
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:014120_0203_0F9302B2CD6F6848"/>villains being always exempted from acts of favor and mercy. Thoſe 200 that had newly ſurrendered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they might give full proof of their fidelity, offered to lead a party of the Engliſh to a place not far off, where 20 more of the enemy might be ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, amongſt whom alſo was one known to be a bloody murderer of an Engliſhman the year before; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly 8 Engliſhmen took 14 of the ſaid Indians, and the next day brought in all the aforeſaid 20 of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, together with the ſaid murderer, who was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after executed, and the reſt taken into favor.</p>
            <p>IT is affirmed alſo that five or ſix Sachems of <hi>Cape-Cod,</hi> towards the eaſtern part of it, came with 300 Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to make peace with the Engliſh, on the 6th of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> one of the ſaid Sachems earneſtly deſiring the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh that none of them might be ſuffered to ſell any ſtrong liquors to the Indians, the trading of which, poſſibly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ath in a meaſure contributed to the preſent miſchiefs.</p>
            <p>THE next day, <hi>July</hi> 7th, a ſmall party of ours, with a few friendly or chriſtian Indians with them, killed and took ſeven of the enemy in the woods not far from <hi>Dedham,</hi> one of which was a <hi>Narrhaganſet</hi> Sachem, who either himſelf informed, or by ſome other at that time certain intelligence was brought to <hi>Boſton,</hi> that ſome of our enemy Indians had got to <hi>Albany,</hi> informing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple there, that they might the more eaſily get powder and ammunition, that the Engliſh and they were now at peace. One of the ſaid Indians was the Sachem of <hi>Springfield,</hi> a bloody and deceitful villian; it is hoped that he is now taken in the ſnare from whence he ſhall not be ſuffered to eſcape.</p>
            <p>PHILIP by this time could not but think his ruin was near at hand; yet that he might, in imitation of him that ſtirred up all this miſchief, expreſs the more wrath becauſe he knew his time was but ſhort, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded if poſſible to deſtroy one more town before his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow came; wherefore, on the 11th of <hi>July,</hi> with
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:014120_0204_0F9302B3600E6BC0"/>all the force he could get, or that he had left, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſet upon <hi>Taunten,</hi> having as was conceived, many hundreds in his company; but his deſign being ſtrangely diſcovered by a negro whom they had taken captive a little before, that having lived near the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians before, underſtood much of their language, who making his eſcape from them, acquainted the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants with the plot; who having timely notice, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed themſelves with ſoldiers, whereby they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to repulſe the enemy upon his firſt approach; ſo as he only fired two houſes, and then fled away: <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Lord keepeth the city the watchman watcheth but in vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE 22d of this month of <hi>July,</hi> as is hinted before, the companies ſent from <hi>Concord May</hi> 30th, up towards <hi>Hadley,</hi> having ſpent much time and pains in purſuit of <hi>Philip</hi> all the country over (whom they could not yet overtake) having tired themſelves with many long and tedious marches through the deſert woods, before they returned home, ſome of them were ſent toward <hi>Mount-Hope,</hi> yet their labour was well improved, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with good ſucceſs at the laſt: For in ranging thoſe woods in <hi>Plymouth</hi> colony, they killed and took (by the help of Capt. <hi>Moſely</hi>'s company, and Capt. <hi>Brat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>'s troop joining with Major <hi>Bradford</hi>'s company of <hi>Plimouth</hi> colony) an hundred and fifty Indians, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the loſs of a man.</p>
            <p>IT was feared that <hi>Philip</hi> and his company would have returned into the <hi>Nipnet</hi> country, to prevent which; ſeveral horſemen were ſent to guard the paſſage; but he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ked about his own country in ſwamps and other ſecret places, where he was as yet hid from the fight of the enemy, although many times they happened to lodge very near him, inſomuch as an Indian captive promiſed in two hours time to bring our ſoldiers to the very place where he was; but they not being able to paſs the neareſt way, came a little too late; for they being ſo cloſely purſued, haſted away, leaving much of their treaſure behind them; their kettles boiling over
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:014120_0205_0F9302B46BD91900"/>the fire, their dead unburried, and 20 of their party were overtaken, that fell into the Engliſh hands: <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> himſelf, and ſome few of his ſtragling followers making their eſcape by a raft over an arm of the ſea, into another neck of land on <hi>Pocaſſet</hi> ſide, not daring to truſt himſelf any longer in <hi>Metapoiſet</hi> woods, ſo full of our Engliſh ſoldiers, as well thoſe of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> as of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> colony, who almoſt every day meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſome of his party, much leſſened his number. Capt. <hi>Church,</hi> that active and unwearied commander of <hi>Plimouth</hi> colony, was at this time as well as long before, out upon the chace with but 18 Engliſh, and 22 Indians that were friends, had four ſeveral engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with <hi>Philip</hi>'s party, wherein he ſpoiled 76 of the enemy, without the loſs of one of his own men. In ſeveral of theſe ſkirmiſhes thoſe Indians that upon ſubmiſſion had their lives given them, have done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſervice in hunting out the enemy in all their lurking places.</p>
            <p>AT another time they took <hi>Philip</hi>'s ſquaw, and one of his chief councellors; and about the ſame time ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sachem about <hi>Pocaſſet,</hi> with 40 Indians ſubmitted himſelf to the government of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> on promiſe of life and liberty. It ſeemed that now the time of our deliverance was come, and the time alſo for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of our enemies: For the laſt week in <hi>July</hi> the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> underſtanding that ſome Indians were ſeen roving up and down the woods about <hi>Dedham,</hi> almoſt ſtarved for want of victuals, ſent a ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of 26, with about 9 or 10 chriſtian Indians, who purſued and took 50 of the enemy, without any loſs to the Engliſh; at which time alſo a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of wampampeag and powder were taken from the enemy. That which increaſed this victory was the ſlaughter of <hi>Pomham,</hi> who was one of the ſtouteſt and moſt valiant Sachems that belonged to the <hi>Narrha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganſets,</hi> whoſe courage and ſtrength was ſo great, that after he had been mortally wounded in the fight ſo as he could not ſtand, yet catching hold of an Engliſhman that by accident came near him, had done him an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:014120_0206_0F9302B4F29A8B48"/>if he had not been preſently reſcued by one of his neighbours. Amongſt the reſt of the captives at that time, was one of the ſaid <hi>Pomham</hi>'s ſons, a very likely youth, and one whoſe countenance would have beſpoke favor for him, had he not belonged to ſo bloody and barbarous an Indian as his father was.</p>
            <p>THESE ſucceſſes being daily ſpread abroad among the Indians, put many of them into a trembling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, not knowing well how to diſpoſe of themſelves. Some that had been leſs active in theſe tragedies, and were rather led by others, than any wiſe inclined to miſchief themſelves, ventured to ſubmit themſelves, of which number was one of <hi>Nipnet</hi> Sachems, called Sagamore <hi>John,</hi> who <hi>July</hi> 27th came to ſurrender himſelf to the Governor and Council of the <hi>Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets</hi> at <hi>Boſton,</hi> bringing along with him 180 of the enemy Indians. This <hi>John,</hi> that he might the more ingratiate himſelf with the Engliſh, whoſe friendſhip he was now willing to ſeek after, did by a wile get into his hands one <hi>Matoonas,</hi> an old malicious villian, who was the firſt that did any miſchief within the <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachnſets</hi> colony, <hi>July</hi> 14th, 1675; bearing an old grudge againſt them as is thought, for juſtice that was done upon one of his ſons 1671, whoſe head ever ſince hangs upon a pole near the gibbet where he was hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up: The bringing in of this malicious caitif was an hopeful preſage that it would not be long before <hi>Philip</hi> himſelf, the grand villian, would in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner receive a juſt reward of his wickedneſs and murders.</p>
            <p>SAGAMORE <hi>John,</hi> who came in the 27th of <hi>July,</hi> affirmed that he had never intended any miſchief to the Engliſh at <hi>Brookfield</hi> the laſt year (near which vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage it ſeems his place was) but that <hi>Philip</hi> coming over night amongſt them, he was forced, for fear of his own life, to join with them againſt the Engliſh. <hi>Matoonas</hi> alſo when he was brought before the Council, and aſked what he had to ſay for himſelf, confeſſed that he had rightly deſerved death, and could expect no other, adding withal, that if he had followed their
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:014120_0207_0F9302B7EF4EC760"/>counſel, he had not come to this; for he had ſeemed to favor the praying Indians, and the chriſtian religion, but like <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> by his practice afterwards diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered quickly that he had no part nor portion in that matter.</p>
            <p>ABOUT this time ſeveral parties of Engliſh within <hi>Plimouth</hi> juriſdiction, were willing to have a hand in ſo good a matter as catching of <hi>Philip</hi> would be, who perceiving that he was now going down the wind, were willing to haſten his fall. Amongſt others, a ſmall party went out of <hi>Bridgewater, July</hi> 31ſt, upon diſcovery, and by providence were directed to fall upon a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Indians where <hi>Philip</hi> was; they came up with them, and killed ſome of his particular friends; <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> himſelf was next to his uncle that was ſhot down, and had the ſoldier that had his choice which to ſhoot at, known which had been the right bird, he might as well have taken him as his uncle; but tis ſaid that he had not long cut off his hair that he might not be known: The party that did this exploit were few in number, and therefore not being able to keep together cloſe in the rear, that cunning fox eſcaped away through buſhes undiſcerned in the rear of the Engliſh: That which was moſt remarkable in this deſign, was that trembling fear appeared to be upon the Indians at this time, inſomuch that one of them having a gun in his hand, well loaded, yet was not able to fire it off, but ſuffered an Engliſh ſoldier to come cloſe up to his breaſt, and ſo ſhot him down, the other not being able to make any reſiſtance; nor were any of the Engliſh hurt at this time.</p>
            <p>THE like terror was ſeen in others at that time, for within two days after Capt. <hi>Church,</hi> the terror of the Indians in <hi>Plimouth</hi> colony, marching in purſuit of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> with about 30 Engliſhmen and 20 reconciled In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, took 23 of the enemy, and the next day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them by their tracks, fell upon their head quarters, and killed and took about 130 of them, loſing only one man. In this engagement God did appear in a more
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:014120_0208_0F9302B8D3BF5410"/>than ordinary manner to fight for the Engliſh, for the Indians by their number, and other advantages of the place, were ſo conveniently provided, that they might have made the firſt ſhot at the Engliſh and done them much damage, but one of their own countrymen in Capt. <hi>Church</hi>'s company eſpying them, called aloud unto them in their own language, telling them that if they ſhot a gun they were all dead men; with which they were ſo amazed, that they durſt not once offer to fire at the Engliſh, which made the victory the more remarkable. <hi>Philip</hi> made a very narrow eſcape at that time, being forced to leave his treaſures, his beloved wife and only ſon, to the mercy of the Engliſh. <hi>Skin for ſkin, all that a man bath will be give for his life.</hi> His ruin being thus gradually carried on, his miſery was not prevented but augmented thereby; being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf made acquainted with the ſenſe and experimental feeling of the captivity of his children, loſs of friends, ſlaughter of his ſubjects, bereavement of all family re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and being ſtripped of all outward comforts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his own life ſhould be taken away. Such a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence paſſed upon <hi>Gain,</hi> made him cry out, <hi>that his puniſhment was greater than be could bear.</hi> This bloody wretch hath one week more to live an object of pity, but a ſpectacle of divine vengeance, his own fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers beginning now to plot againſt his life, that they might make the better terms for their own; as they did alſo ſeek to betray ſquaw Sachem of <hi>Pocaſſet, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>'s near kinſwoman and confederate. For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auguſt</hi> 6th, an Indian willing to ſhift for himſelf, fled to <hi>Taunton,</hi> offering to lead any of the Engliſh that would follow him, to a party of Indians, which they might eaſily apprehend, which 20 perſons attempted, and accordingly ſeized the whole company, 26 in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, all but the ſquaw Sachem herſelf, who intending to make an eſcape from the danger, attempted to get over the river, or arm of the ſea near by, upon a raft or ſome pieces of broken wood; but whether tired and ſpent with ſwimming, or ſtarved with cold and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſhe was ſtark naked in <hi>Metapoiſet,</hi> not far from the water ſide, which made ſome think that ſhe was
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:014120_0209_0F9302B96BB3E1A8"/>firſt half-drowned, and ſo ended her wretched life juſt in that place where the year before ſhe had helped <hi>Philip</hi> to make his eſcape; her head being cut off and ſet upon a pole in <hi>Taunton,</hi> was known by ſome Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans then priſoners, which ſet them into an horrible lamentation; but ſuch was the righteous hand of God in bringing at laſt that miſchief upon themſelves, which they had without cauſe long acted againſt others.</p>
            <p>PHILIP, like a ſavage wild beaſt, having been hunted by the Engliſh forces thro' the woods above an hundred miles backward and forward, at laſt was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to his own den upon <hi>Mount-Hope,</hi> where he reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a few of his beſt friends into a ſwamp, which proved but a priſon to keep him faſt till the meſſengers of death came by divine permiſſion to execute ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon him, which was thus accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>SUCH had been his inveterate malice and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt the Engliſh, that deſpairing of mercy from them, he could not bear that any thing ſhould be ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to him about a peace, inſomuch that he cauſed one of his confederates to be killed for propounding an expedient of peace; which ſo provoked ſome of his company, not altogether ſo deſperate as himſelf, that one of them (a relation to him that was killed) fled to <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> whither the brave Captain <hi>Church</hi> was newly retired to recruit his men for a little time, being much tired with hard marches all that week, inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them that <hi>Philip</hi> was fled to a ſwamp in <hi>Mount-Hope,</hi> whither he would undertake to lead them that would purſue him. This was welcome news, and the beſt cordial for ſuch martial ſpirits; whereupon he immediately, with a ſmall company of men, part En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh and part Indians, beg in another march, which ſhall prove fatal to <hi>Philip,</hi> and end that controverſy be-between the Engliſh and him: For coming very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the ſide of the ſwamp, his ſoldiers began to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round it, and (whether the devil appeared to him in a dream that night, as he did unto <hi>Saul,</hi> foreboding his tragical end, it matters not) as he was endeavoring to
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:014120_0210_0F9302BA19985670"/>make his eſcape out of the ſwamp, he was ſhot through the heart by an Indian of his own nation, as it is ſaid, that had all this while preſerved a neutrality untill this time, but now had the caſting vote in his power, by which he determined the quarrel that had been ſo long in ſuſpenſe. In him is fulfilled what was ſaid in the prophet, <hi>Wo to thee that ſpoileſt, and thou waſt not ſpoiled, and dealeſt treacherouſly, and they dealt not trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly with thee; when thou ſhalt ceaſe to ſpoil thou ſhalt he ſpoiled, and when thou ſhalt make an end to deal treacherouſly, they ſhall deal treacherouſly with thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WITH <hi>Philip</hi> at this time fell five of his truſtieſt followers, of whom one was ſaid to be the ſon of his chief captain, that had ſhot the firſt gun at the Engliſh the year before. This was done the 12th day of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi> 1676, a remarkable teſtimony of divine favor to the colony of <hi>Plimouh,</hi> who had for their former ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, appointed the 17th day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> following, to be kept as a day of ſolemn thankſgiving to Almighty God. There having been ſo ſtrange a turn of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence obſerved in the late ſucceſſes obtained in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Plimouth</hi> colony, it may not be amiſs here to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the occaſions that did lead thereunto, and alſo into the progreſs and continuance thereof, after the ſlaughter of <hi>Philip</hi> that grand REBEL.</p>
            <p>IN the preceeding narration frequent mention hath been made of one Captain <hi>Church,</hi> whom God hath made an inſtrument of ſignal victories over the Indians in that colony, and of great advantage in that reſpect to that whole juriſdiction. It happened that the ſaid Capt. <hi>Church</hi> ſome time in <hi>June,</hi> of this preſent year 1676, paſſing over in a canoe from <hi>Pocaſſet</hi> to <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> as he uſed frequently to do, (having had much employment upon the ſaid neck of land ſo called) ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Indians whom he had known before at <hi>Lakenham,</hi> a village near <hi>Plimouth,</hi> beckoned to him, as if they had a mind to ſpeak with him; he having had ſo much experience as well as others of their treachery, was not willing to adventure too haſtily to come near
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:014120_0211_0F9302BC220D0A80"/>them; but when they ſeemed to urge very much, and made ſigns to him, and at laſt laid down their guns in his fight, he began to think with himſelf there might be ſomething in the matter more than ordinary, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he reſolved to go a little nearer to the ſhore, and then he perceived they had a great mind to ſpeak with him, uſing much importunity for that end, inſomuch that he ventured to go a-ſhore amongſt them, having but one Engliſhman and two Indians with him; he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected them to keep off the canoe while he diſcourſed with the Indians on ſhore. As ſoon as he came among them, they told him they were weary of fighting, and that they had fought ſo long by <hi>Philip</hi>'s inſtigation, but they could not tell for what end, and therefore were reſolved they would fight no longer, and all they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired of him was, that he would make way for them to the Governor, that they might live quietly amongſt the Engliſh as they had done before, and that they would deliver up their arms, or would go out with them if he pleaſed to accept of them, and fight for him; to that end they deſired a time to parly with him further about that buſineſs, at what time and place he would appoint: He told them he would meet them two days after at <hi>Seaconet,</hi> a place up higher upon the ſaid neck, about 12 o'clock; accordingly he came to the ſaid place, and found the ſame Indians, with ſome others, and their Sunke Squaw, or chief woman of that plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, there ready to meet him.</p>
            <p>AFTER they had fallen into diſcourſe about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the war, as well as the ſucceſs and miſchief of it, they would have put the blame off from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and laid it upon the Engliſh: But he preſently convinced them by an undeniable evidence, that they firſt began the war: For ſaid he, upon this <hi>Pocaſſet, July</hi> 7th, 1675, you firſt fought with ſome of <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> whereof one was my own ſervant, whoſe leg you broke, and the ſame day you ſhot at myſelf and company, before ever we meddled with you. They were ſo fully convinced herewith, that they found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:014120_0212_0F9302BC5BE47120"/>to reply, but fell into other diſcourſe about a peace, which they ſeemed very deſirous to obtain upon any equal terms, as was ſaid before. There were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout fifteen of the Indians preſent, beſides their Sunke Squaw (which is with us their Governeſs or Lady) in concluſion they engaged forever after to leave <hi>Philip,</hi> and to go out with him; which they did forthwith, as ſoon as he had obtained a peace for them with the Governor.</p>
            <p>IT is here to be obſerved, that theſe were not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <hi>Philip</hi>'s Indians, but belonged to the <hi>Seaconet</hi> Squaw, who was nearly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

About 20 or 30 of theſe <hi>Seaconet</hi> Indians have conſtantly gone out with Capt. <hi>Church</hi> ever ſince, and not only been faithful and ſerviceable to him, but very ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in every enterprize they have gone about, nor hath he loſt any of them in any ſkirmiſh with the other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians: And it is ſaid that this act of theſe Indians broke <hi>Philip</hi>'s heart as ſoon as ever he underſtood it, ſo as he never rejoiced after, or had any ſucceſs in any of his deſigns, but loſt his men one time after another, till himſelf at laſt fell into the hands of thoſe under Capt. <hi>Church</hi>'s command: For at the ſwamp when <hi>Philip</hi> was ſlain, Capt. <hi>Church</hi> appointed an Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and an Indian to ſtand at ſuch a place of the ſwamp, where it happened <hi>Philip</hi> was breaking away; the morning being wet and rainy, the Engliſhman's gun would not fire; the Indian having an old muſket with a large touch-hole, it took fire the more readily, with which <hi>Philip</hi> was diſpatched, the bullet paſſing directly through his heart, where <hi>Joab</hi> thruſt his darts into rebellious <hi>Abſalom.</hi>

            <p>THUS did divine vengeance retaliate on this noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious traitor, that had againſt his league and covenant riſen up againſt the government of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> to raiſe up againſt him one of his own people, or one that was in league with him, as he was with the Engliſh: The
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:014120_0213_0F9302BD47EF5B58"/>Indian that did this execution was called <hi>Alderman,</hi> of <hi>Seaconet,</hi> that had never done any act of hoſtility againſt the Engliſh. By theſe paſſages it is manifeſt, that as <hi>the hearts of all are in the hard of God, ſo he turns them as he pleaſes,</hi> either to ſavor his people, or to hate and deal ſubtilly with his ſervants, as ſeems good to him. Since this engagement with the <hi>Seaconet</hi> Indians (to leave <hi>Philip,</hi> and to go with Capt. <hi>Church</hi>) it is cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly affirmed, that ſuch hath been their ſucceſs, that ſince <hi>June</hi> aforeſaid, to the end of <hi>October</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there have been 700 Indians ſubdued, either by killing or taking captive, by means of Capt. <hi>Church</hi> and his company, part Indians and part Engliſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides 300 that have come in voluntarily to ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the government of <hi>Plimouth.</hi> It appears thus by the ſequel of things, that after the Lord hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed his work upon his people, and he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to call his enemies to an account, and puniſh them for the price of their hearts, and for all their treachery and cruelty againſt his ſervants. <hi>Philip</hi>'s Captains have run the ſame fate with himſelf, ſome before and ſome ſince his own fall.</p>
            <p>IN <hi>June</hi> laſt one <hi>Tioſhq,</hi> a great Captain of his, his wife and child, or children being taken, though he eſcaped himſelf at firſt, yet came ſince and ſurrendered himſelf. The next noted Captain of <hi>Philip</hi>'s Indians that was brought in after <hi>Philip</hi>'s death, was called <hi>Teſpiquin,</hi> a notorious villain, next to <hi>Philip,</hi> he was called the black Sachem's ſon: It was this <hi>Teſpiquin</hi> that burnt ſo many houſes in <hi>Plimouth</hi> lately. Capt. <hi>Church</hi> with his company were in purſuit of him in <hi>September</hi> laſt, two days before they could get near him, at the laſt, on the third day, they found the track made by the ſaid <hi>Teſpiquin</hi>'s party, as they went to fetch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples from the Engliſh orchards: This was ſomething of a blind track, therefore they were forced to take up their quarters that night without diſcovering any place of their rendezvous. The next morning about 9 o'clock they came to their firſt rendezvous, from which they were juſt gone: At 1 o'clock they came to the ſecond,
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:014120_0214_0F9302BDEF4D3CD8"/>and miſſing them there, they ſoon after came to the third track, wherein after they had marched a while, they perceived they grew very near them, by the cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a child which they heard: The place was near <hi>Lakenham,</hi> upon <hi>Pocaſſet</hi> neck, ſo full of buſhes that a man could not ſee a rod before him: Capt. <hi>Church</hi> ordered his men to march up together in one rank, becauſe he diſcovered the Indians were laid in one range by ſeveral fires, ſo that by that time they all came up into an even rank very near together, within a few yards of them, as he had appointed, they all ſuddenly ruſhed together in upon them, and catched hold of them, not ſuffering any to eſcape, there being about fifty of them in all: <hi>Teſpiquin</hi>'s wife and children were there, but he was abſent, as alſo one <hi>Jacob,</hi> and a girl that belonged to that company. The Captain's haſte would not admit of his tarrying till they came in, (though the Indians ſaid they might come that night) wherefore he thought upon this project, to leave two old Squaws upon the place, with victuals, and bid them tell <hi>Teſpiquin</hi> that he ſhould be his Captain over his Indians if he was found ſo ſtout a man as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported him to be; for the Indians had ſaid that <hi>Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piquin</hi> could not be pierced by a bullet, for ſaid they, he was ſhot twice, but the bullets glanced by him and could not hurt him. Thus the Captain marched away with his booty, leaving this trap behind him to take the reſt: The next morning he came to ſee what his trap had catched, there he found <hi>Jacob</hi> aforeſaid (a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious wretch) and the girl he miſſed before, but not <hi>Teſpiquin:</hi> But within a day or two after the ſaid <hi>Teſpiquin,</hi> upon the hopes of being made a Captain under Capt. <hi>Church,</hi> came after ſome of the company, and ſubmitted himſelf in the Captain's abſence, and was ſent to <hi>Plimouth,</hi> but upon trial (which was the condition on which his being promiſed a Captain's commiſſion under Capt. <hi>Church</hi> did depend) he was found penetrable by the Engliſh guns, for he fell down at the firſt ſhot, and thereby received the juſt reward of his former wickedneſs. About a fortnight after the ſurpriſing of <hi>Teſpiquin,</hi> was one <hi>Toteſon</hi>'s company ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:014120_0215_0F9302BEB9ACA218"/>wherein were above 50 perſons; but <hi>Toteſon</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped, and is ſtill out in rebellion, unleſs vengeance hath overtaken him ſince.</p>
            <p>THE next that was ſeized was one <hi>Annawan,</hi> a very ſubtle, politic fellow, and one of <hi>Philip</hi>'s chief coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors; he had about twelve men, and as many wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children in his company, who were diſcovered by their ſhooting at the Engliſh horſes, and cattle; ſome of whom being taken, they made known the reſt. Capt. <hi>Church</hi> at that time had but five Engliſhmen, and twenty Indians. The place where this <hi>Annawan</hi> had betaken himſelf, was a ledge of rocks inacceſſible but at one place, which by a few hands might eaſily have been defended againſt a great number of aſſailants: But Capt <hi>Church</hi> by direction got up to their wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wams before they were aware of it; and preſently told <hi>Annawan</hi> that he came to ſup with him that night; whereupon the ſaid <hi>Annawan</hi> (who had fallen flat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, expecting to have his head cut off) look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up and cried taubut, in their language, thank you, as one being much affected with the generoſity of our Engliſh Captain; they found ſome of the Engliſh beef boiling in their kettles: After ſupper he had much diſcourſe with the ſaid <hi>Annawan,</hi> they lay down to ſleep together in the wigwam; Capt. <hi>Church</hi> laying one of his legs upon <hi>Annawan,</hi> and the other upon his ſon, that he might have notice if any of them offered to ſtir: After midnight <hi>Annawan</hi> roſe up, and Capt. <hi>Church</hi> was preſently awake, and intended to watch after his priſoner: He thought at firſt he might have gone forth upon ſome neceſſary occaſion; but not long after he returned again, having fetched out of a ſwamp hard by, two horns of powder, and a large belt of peag, ſuppoſed to be <hi>Philip</hi>'s belt, all which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to Capt. <hi>Church,</hi> in a way of thankful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of his courteſy. Amongſt other diſcourſe that paſſed between them concerning the occaſion of the war, and carrying of it on, the Indian would fain have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed <hi>Philip,</hi> and laid the blame upon the praying
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:014120_0216_0F9302BF8D1D0A58"/>Indians (as they are diſtinguiſhed from others by that character) and others of the younger ſort of his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, who coming with their ſeveral tales (which he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened to ſticks laid on a heap) till by the multitude of them, a great fire came to be kindled: They make much uſe of parabolical expreſſions; for ſo ſaid <hi>Solomon, where no wood is, there the fire goeth out; ſo where there is no tale-bearer the ſtrife ceaſeth,</hi> Prov. 26.20. But <hi>Philip</hi> had had large and long experience of the gentleneſs and kindneſs of the Engliſh, both to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and to his people, ſo as unleſs he had borne an evil and malicious mind againſt the Engliſh, he would never have hearkened to thoſe ſtories, contrary to his faithful promiſe and allegiance.</p>
            <p>THE ſaid <hi>Annawan</hi> confeſſed alſo that he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve by all thoſe late occurrences that there was a great God that over-ruled all; and that he had found that whatever he had done to any or thoſe, whether Indians or Engliſh, the ſame was brought upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in after time. He confeſſed alſo that he had put to death ſeveral of the Engliſh, that they had taken alive, ten in one day, and could not deny but that ſome of them had been tortured, and now he could not but ſee the juſtice of the great God upon himſelf, with many other things of a like nature. But whatever his confeſſions of this nature were, being forced from him by the power of conſcience, after he was delivered up to authority, he was put to death, as he juſtly had deſerved.</p>
            <p>IT is ſaid that <hi>Philip</hi> when he firſt began his rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, had about 300 fighting men under him, beſides thoſe that belonged to his kinſwoman <hi>Wetamoe,</hi> drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about <hi>Taunton,</hi> that had almoſt as many under her; and one <hi>Quenopin,</hi> a <hi>Narrhaganſet</hi> Sachem that lived near him, and j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ined with him in his quarrel with the Engliſh: But it is certain that there are ſcarce any that are now left, that belonged to either of them: So a though the Almighty hath made uſe of them to be a ſcourge to his people, he hath now turned his hand
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:014120_0217_0F9302C18C401FA8"/>againſt them to their utter deſtruction, and extirpation from off the face of the earth, peradventure to make room for others of his people to come in their ſtead.</p>
            <p>As for the reſt of the <hi>Narrhaganſets</hi> that joined in <hi>Philip</hi>'s quarrel, it is already declared what end they were come unto.

            <p>IT is written ſince from <hi>Albany,</hi> that there were ſundry loſt beſides the 45 aforementioned, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of threeſcore in all; and alſo that an 120 of them are ſince dead of ſickneſs; ſo that vengeance ſeems to be purſuing of them as well as the reſt.

            <p>THE Indians being thus diſperſed ſeveral ways, were ſtrangely confounded and deſtroyed one parcel after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, until there was none left in the weſtern or ſouthern parts, that durſt make any oppoſition all the following part of the year. As for thoſe that fled weſtward toward <hi>Albany,</hi> we ſhall there leave them for the preſent, wiſhing we may never hear any more of them: A perſon of quality informs, that at <hi>Hartford</hi> in <hi>September</hi> laſt, he was preſent at the examination of one <hi>Choes,</hi> an Indian, formerly of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> but one of the <hi>Narrhaganſet</hi> fort the laſt winter, who confeſſed that he was one of that company of Indians that went weſtward the month before, toward <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s river; but after the fight at <hi>Auſotunnoog,</hi> he ſaid he returned back to <hi>Connecticut</hi> for fear of the <hi>Mohawks;</hi> and that he lay hid about <hi>Farmington,</hi> till he was almoſt ſtarved; and then he went to the ſea-ſide to make uſe of the oyſter-bank at <hi>Stratford</hi> for his relief, where he was eſpyed by the Indians, and ſo brought to <hi>Hartford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HE affirmed that there were above 250 fighting men amongſt thoſe Indians that fled weſtward, beſides wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children; and that near 200 of them paſſed the great river below <hi>Albany,</hi> and were ſheltered by the Indians of that place, called <hi>Moheganders;</hi> but about 80 of them tarried on the hither ſide of that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, near a Dutch village. But he being convicted of fighting againſt the Engliſh, was condemned to die, and executed about the ſame time. Some few of the reſt were ſkulking about the <hi>Narrhaganſet</hi> country the laſt fall, hoping to ſhelter themſelves under <hi>Uncas,</hi> but he not willing to give them countenance againſt the
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:014120_0219_0F9302C26214EE08"/>mind of his friends at <hi>Connecticut,</hi> hath ſince abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to ſhift for themſelves, who have been moſt of them taken and brought in priſoners to the Engliſh this winter.</p>
            <p>ABOUT the month of <hi>October</hi> laſt, Mr. <hi>Stanton</hi> chanced to come from <hi>Seaconk</hi> with 3 Indians in his company, <hi>Pequods</hi> or <hi>Mohegins,</hi> they hearing by a captive at one of the next towns, that there was a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the enemy not far off, preſently left Mr. <hi>Stanton</hi> and purſued after them, whom they ſoon after overtook, and made them all priſoners: Amongſt them was an old man, not able to go their pace, but promiſing to come after them, they ſpared his life: But as ſoon as the men returned at night from hunting, the old man told them what had befel their women and children, whereupon the next morning they preſently following after them, overtook them, and ſo recovered the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, and ſlew one of the three that carried them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; the other two hardly eſcaped; one of them is called Major <hi>Symon,</hi> being part a <hi>Pequod</hi> and part a <hi>Narrhaganſet,</hi> but of extraordinary ſtrength and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; he perceiving the danger they were in, challenged to fight hand to hand with any five of them with their hatchets; but they unwilling to hang their ſucceſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hazard of a ſingle combat, came all towards him at once, whereupon firſt diſcharging his gun a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the whole company, he broke through them all by force, and ſo eſcaped their hands, with one of his companions. This <hi>Symon</hi> hath been very active in killing and taking many of the enemy; ſome ſay that he with his own hands hath taken and killed above threeſcore; and either out of hatred to the enemy, or love to the Engliſh, is this laſt week gone with the ſoldiers to the eaſtward, in purſuit of our quarrel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them in thoſe parts.</p>
            <p>AT another time not long before, when he was out againſt the enemy, he came ſuddenly upon a great number of them as they were ſpread under a ſteep bank, from whence leaping down into the midſt of
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:014120_0220_0F9302C351886B28"/>them, he killed ſome and took others. Fighting it ſeems is a recreation to him, for he is ſeldom at home above four or five days together. Some ſay that in one of his former expeditions, being much wearied and ſpent he laid himſelf down to ſleep, but towards morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he fell into a dream, wherein he apprehended the Indians were upon him, when ſuddenly riſing up he eſpyed the Indians coming toward him, but ſuddenly preſenting his guns againſt them, he ſo frighted them, that they gave him an opportunity to make an eſcape from a multitude of them.</p>
            <p>SINCE the beginning of <hi>December</hi> laſt, news com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down to <hi>Boſton</hi> that miſchief was done about <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conk</hi> and <hi>Rehoboth,</hi> by ſome remaining Indians therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, killing their ſwine and horſes, ſeveral perſons of <hi>Medfield</hi> went out after them, and purſuing them by their track, came upon a ſmall party, of whom they took three, one of which eſcaped while ſome of the company were going after the reſt. Thoſe that were taken confeſſed there was about 60 that were lurking up and down in thoſe woods. The ſaid two Indians were brought into <hi>Boſton</hi> the 8th of <hi>January.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A commiſſion was formerly granted to <hi>Peter Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im,</hi> an Indian of <hi>Natick,</hi> to go out in purſuit of them, with 29 of his company; a few of the Engliſh from <hi>Medfield</hi> went with him, who being ſoon tired with marching in the ſnow, returned. The Indians kept on in their deſign, and came acroſs a conſiderable party of the enemy, having traced them till they found where they lodged over night; they ſurrounded them early in the morning, as their manner is, and then offered them quarter if they would yield; eight reſolute fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows refuſed, who were inſtantly ſhot, the reſt were all ſeized. the whole number was 42. This was done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the middle of <hi>January,</hi> ſince which ſeveral ſuch exploits have been done by them. <hi>January</hi> 23d, the ſame company of Indians took 22 of the enemy, among whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ere five able men, and five arms; they ſent the priſoners home by five of their company, the reſt went further in the chace.</p>

               <pb n="191" facs="unknown:014120_0221_0F9302C3E80CF9B8"/>
               <hi>January</hi> 26th, another parcel of the enemy were brought in, eight in number, of whom five were men, amongſt whom was the Indian called <hi>Cornelius,</hi> who three years ſince was indicted for killing an Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's cow; upon which he is ſaid to have uttered ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral threatning ſpeeches that he would kill Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and their cows too; which was now remembered againſt him, when he was in particular called to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for having a hand in killing ſome of the Engliſh and Indians alſo in league with us, for which he was ſentenced to die, and was accordingly executed the 15th of <hi>February</hi> following.</p>
            <p>CONCERNING the reſt of the Indians either in the colony of <hi>Plimouth, Connecticut,</hi> or the <hi>Maſſachuſetts,</hi> there is no occurrence more of moment come to light ſince the end of <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt, ſave what is laſt mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before; yet it is very remarkable, that although terms of peace were offered to all that would come in and ſurrender themſelves (as appears by a declaration put out in <hi>July</hi> laſt) and that a <hi>Nipnet</hi> Sachem called <hi>John,</hi> did thereupon with a number of his company come in and offer themſelves, and were accordingly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured of their lives and other concernments; yet did that treacherous villain make an eſcape this winter from Capt. <hi>Prentice</hi>'s houſe (under whoſe charge he was put, about <hi>Cambridge</hi> village) and with above 20 more fled away into the woods to ſhift for himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt of his bloody companions; they were ſoon after purſued, but had gone too faſt and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oo far to be overtaken. Whether it were conſciouſneſs of their own guilt, that having had a hand in the blood of the Engliſh they feared vengeance hung over their heads; or whether they liked not the Engliſh manners ſo well as to be confined thereunto: Wild creatures ordinarily love the liberty of the woods better than the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

They made none acquainted with their deſign before they went away; and as yet little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count can be given of them, only it is known that one or two of their number have ſince been killed, and that one or two of their families are entertained by <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas,</hi>
               <pb n="192" facs="unknown:014120_0222_0F9302C49732FED0"/>but what is become of the reſt is uncertain; there were but ſeven of the company men, ſo they are not capable of doing much miſchief. Some of late have travelled through the woods to <hi>Connecticut,</hi> but have met with no Indians, nor did they hear of any in their paſſing between this place and that.</p>

            <head>A NARRATIVE OF THE INDIAN WARS IN NEW-ENGLAND FROM PISCATAQUA TO PEMMAQUID.</head>
            <p>THE occaſion, riſe and progreſs of the war with the Indians in the ſouthen and weſtern parts of <hi>New-England,</hi> together with the iſſue and ſucceſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, hath in the former part of this narrative been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready declared. Before an enterance be made into a relation of thoſe troubles that befel the eaſtern and north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern parts of the ſaid country from the Indians inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe parts, it will be requiſite to give ſome ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral deſcription of the place, as being leſs frequented, and ſo more unknown than the other, like <hi>Herald</hi>'s that uſed to blazon the field before they meddle with the charge, as an hiſtorian once ſaid, that ſo the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may not miſs the truth in a ſtory, by being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with the places connected with the diſcourſe. Briefly therefore, that more coſt and pains be not ſpent in the ſurveying a barren and rocky country, than will quit coſt (the liſt or border here being known to be worth more than the whole cloth) that whole track of land being of little worth, unleſs it were for the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders thereof upon the ſea coaſt, and ſome ſpots and ſkirts of more deſirable land upon the banks of ſome rivers, how much ſoever it be valued by them that know nothing thereof, but by the uncertain and fallible reports of ſuch as have only ſailed by the country, or viewed ſome of the rivers and havens, but never paſſed
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:014120_0226_0F9302C7ABD586F0"/>through the heart of the continent. The whole being ſcarce worth half thoſe mens lives that have been loſt theſe two laſt years in hopes to ſave it.</p>
            <p>THIS north part of <hi>New-England,</hi> did firſt, like <hi>Zarah,</hi> put forth its hand, thereby inviting the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers to twiſt the ſcarlet thread of their hopes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſame; by that auſpicious beginning they were ready to promiſe themſelves great proſperity in having that advantage before others to plant and people that part of the country. But that fair opportunity was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt quite loſt by ſome fatal and miſchievous accidents happening ſoon after that noble enterprize was firſt ſet on foot, as hath been already in part, and may hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be more fully declared.</p>
            <p>THE firſt place that ever was poſſeſſed by the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, in hopes of making a plantation in thoſe parts, was a tract of land on the weſt ſide of the river <hi>Kenne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck,</hi> then called <hi>Sagatawock,</hi> ſince <hi>Sagadahock</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places adjoining were ſoon after ſeized and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for trading and fiſhing. The more remote and furtheſt northward at this time belonging to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh (<hi>Penobſcot</hi> forty years ſince being ſurprized by the <hi>French,</hi> and by them held to this day) is called <hi>Pemma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid,</hi> diſtant ſeven or eight leagues from <hi>Kennebeck,</hi> and is the utmoſt boundary of <hi>New-England,</hi> being about forty leagues diſtant from the mouth of <hi>Piſcataqua</hi> ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. <hi>Pemmaquid</hi> is a very commodious haven for ſhips, and hath been found very advantageous to ſuch as uſed to come upon theſe coaſts to make fiſhing voyages; ſouth-weſt or ſouth-eaſt from whence about ſix or ſeven leagues, lies an iſland called <hi>Monhiggon,</hi> of much uſe on the ſame account for fiſhing, it lying three or four leagues into the ſea from <hi>Damaril</hi>'s cove, a place of like advantage for the ſtages of fiſhermen in former times. There have been for a long time ſeven or eight conſiderable dwellings about <hi>Pemmaquid,</hi> which are well accomodated with paſture land about the haven for feeding cattle, and ſome fields alſo for tillage; all the land improvable for ſuch uſes being already taken
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:014120_0227_0F9302C857CA6C70"/>up by ſuch a number of inhabitants as is already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
            <p>IN the mouth of the river <hi>Kennebeck</hi> lies a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able iſland called <hi>Arowſick,</hi> ſome years ſince purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Major <hi>Clarke</hi> and Capt. <hi>Lake,</hi> two merchants of <hi>Boſton,</hi> on which they built ſeveral large dwellings, with a watch uſe and many other edifices near the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſide, it being intended by the owners for a place of trading as well as planting; there being many of late ſeated there ſit to carry on each deſign; where al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo was built a fort, which if it had been carefully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, might have proved the defence and ſecurity of all that ſide af the country, as it uſed to be their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine.

There is another river that iſſues into <hi>Kennebeck</hi> a little higher up into the country, called <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypſcot,</hi> that comes down from behind <hi>Caſco-Bay.</hi> This <hi>Pegypſcot</hi> is the ſeat of the <hi>Amoſcogging</hi> Indians, who have had a great, if not a principal hand in the late miſchiefs.</p>
            <p>SOME few leagues to the ſouth of <hi>Kennebeck</hi> lies the famous and ſpacious haven called <hi>Caſco-Bay,</hi> the north eaſt cape of which is made by an iſland called <hi>Saguin;</hi> the ſouthern or oppoſite point of land is called <hi>Cape-Elizabeth.</hi> Within the boſom of this bay, being about eight or nine leagues over at the mouth of it, are a great number of ſmall iſlands, many of them being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by fiſhermen and others; one of the principal of thoſe is called <hi>Jewels-Iſland.</hi> There are many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces about this bay ſit to make commodious habitations, and on the ſouth ſide of it is a ſmall village called <hi>Falmouth;</hi> all, or moſt of it lately deſtroyed by the Indians.</p>

NOT far from <hi>Caſco,</hi> to the ſouthward or ſouth-weſt, ſtill is a river called <hi>Spurwick,</hi> over againſt which lies <hi>Richmond</hi>-iſland, not far from the main land, being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided therefrom by a ſmall channel, fordable at low water; it hath for a long time been the ſeat of Mr. <hi>Jordan,</hi> in right of Mr. <hi>Winter,</hi> the former if not the firſt proprietor thereof, whoſe daughter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>THERE is another harbour lying a little ſouthward of <hi>Saco,</hi> made by that which is called <hi>Cape-Porpuiſe;</hi> a convenient ſeat for fiſhermen, as are moſt of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places above-named. Between <hi>Cape-Porpuiſe</hi> and <hi>Piſcataqua</hi> there are but two ſmall towns more, (tho' ambitions of great names) the one called <hi>Wells,</hi> and the other <hi>York. Wells</hi> is ſeated upon a ſmall river or creek, affording a ſmall harbour ſit only for barks and ſmaller veſſels; on each ſide of which town lies a ſmall river, the firſt called <hi>Kennebunk,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Magun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuck.</hi> The other town is <hi>York,</hi> formerly known by the name of <hi>Agamenticus,</hi> from a high hill of that name not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſcouragements the firſt planters met with in their firſt winter ſeaſoning, in that cold and rocky de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart (which made them all return home in the year 1608) Sir <hi>Francis Popham,</hi> his ſon, having the ſhips and proviſion which remained of the company, and ſupplying what was neceſſary for his purpoſe, ſent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times to the coaſt for trade and fiſhing, of whoſe loſs or gain, as faith my author, himſelf was beſt able to give an account: And ſome of the ſhips ſent by him, and the Earl of <hi>Southhampton,</hi> with other noble adventurers, did bring home ſome of the natives of the place in one of the following years, by whoſe infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations ſome of the firſt undertakers were encouraged once more to try the verity of their hopes, and ſee if poſſibly they might find ſomething that could induce a freſh reſolution to proſecute ſo pious and honorable a work.</p>

The ſaid places were held by the Engliſh many years after, till about the year 1635, by commiſſion from the Scotch Lord aforeſaid; but how his right came afterwards to be alienated to any of the French nation, doth not concern us with reference to the buſineſs in hand, further to enquire.</p>
            <p>THINGS remaining in this poſture for the ſpace of near ſeven years, ſome of the firſt adventurers appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of better hopes of good that might enſue by a freſh attempt, reſolved to ſet the deſign a foot a ſecond time, to which end ſeveral ſhips were ſent on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in the year 1615, but with as bad ſucceſs as the former; for in the year before, viz 1614, Capt. <hi>Smith,</hi> deſirous to promote the colony of <hi>New-England,</hi> as well as that of <hi>Virginia,</hi> came thither with two veſſels, and returned back to England in the leaſt of them. with intent to be there again that next year to promote the ſaid plantation; but after he was gone, one <hi>Thomas Hunt,</hi> maſter of the ſhip he left behind, like a diſhoneſt man, to prevent the carrying on the plantation, that he and a few merchants might wholly enjoy the benefit of the trade of the country, after he had made his voyage, ſeized upon 24 of the poor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent natives, that in confidence of his honeſty, had put themſelves into his hands, then clapping them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hatches, carried them away to <hi>Malego,</hi> whither he was bound with the fiſh he had made upon the coaſt, for that market; but this vile act, although it kept him for ever after from any more employment in thoſe
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:014120_0232_0F9302169985F750"/>parts, yet that was the leaſt part of the miſchief that attended his wicked practice; for upon the arrival of the adventurers ſhips the next year, two natives of the place that had been ſome years in England, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back unto the ſaid ſhips as ſoon as they underſtood the injury ſo treacherouſly done to their countrymen, they contracted ſuch a hatred againſt our whole nation, that although one of the ſaid natives died ſoon after, yet the other called <hi>Epenow,</hi> ſtudied how to be reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which he ſo far found means to effect, that he fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated this ſecond attempt of ſettling a plantation in theſe parts.</p>
            <p>YET did not the adventurers caſt off all hope of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on their deſign. wherein Providence within a few years after ſo favored them, that one or more of the ſavages, called <hi>Tiſquamtum</hi> and <hi>Samoſet,</hi> carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by <hi>Hunt,</hi> was brought back to <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> from whence he was ſoon after conveyed by the prudent endeavor of Captain <hi>Maſon</hi> (then Governor of the plantation began upon <hi>Newfoundland</hi>) into the hands of ſome of the adventurers, by whoſe means they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to work a peace betwixt the ſaid natives on that coaſt where the fire had been kindled before; for the adventurers employed Capt. <hi>Thomas Darmer,</hi> a prudent and induſtrious gentleman, to ſettle the affairs of the plantation, now a third time revived again about <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebeck,</hi> about the year 1619. By his prudence and care a laſting peace was made betwixt the natives of the place and the Engliſh, who were but a little before ſo abhorred by them, for the wrong formerly received, ſo as the plantation began at laſt to proſper, and continue in good liking, and aſſurance of the friendſhip of their neighbours that had been lately ſo exaſperated againſt them. This <hi>Tiſquamtum</hi> beforementioned, was not a little inſtrumental and helpful to the plantation begun at <hi>New-Plimouth</hi> about the following year, 1620, in their weak beginnings, there being frequent mention of his name, as alſo of one <hi>Sameſet,</hi> a native of the ſame place, by the like providence brought back to <hi>Kenne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck,</hi> and from thence with <hi>Tiſquamtum</hi> came to the
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:014120_0233_0F93021792B323D0"/>new planters at <hi>Patuxet,</hi> or <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and bro't them into acquaintance with <hi>Maſſaſoit,</hi> the great Sachem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thoſe parts; without whoſe friendſhip that new plantation would hardly have ſubſiſted long.</p>
            <p>THIS ſtory premiſed, is the more to be obſerved in this place, becauſe the friendſhip upon the means and occaſions aforeſaid, confirmed between the Indians in theſe eaſtern parts and the Engliſh, had continued ſtedfaſt and conſtant to this year, when it was broken by another treacherous and wicked practice of a like nature, and parrallel to that of the aforeſaid <hi>Hunt,</hi> as may more fully be declared afterwards.</p>
            <p>POSSIBLY the like ſatisfaction may prove the more probable means to procure a ſettled peace. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn whence this digreſſion hath been made. Some years were ſpent to bring things to this iſſue: The adventurers were put to much care and pains before they could get their patent confirmed and renewed again<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t Many obſtructions they met with from ſome interlopers that began to look into the trade of this country, and would irregularly have had a ſhare there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, or made it common to all traders, to which end they petitioned to a parliament then called, to bring about their ends, but at the laſt it was ſettled firmly in the hands of ſundry noble and worthy patentees, Lords, Knights, gentlemen, and merchants, commonly known by the name of the council of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> who had the abſolute power under the King for making all grants, and diſpoſing of all lands from the 40th to the 48th degrees of north latitude; all which was accompliſhed about the year 1621. Some printed relations that ſpeak of theſe tranſactions, write much of the flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtate, and hopeful proſperity of this plantation, publiſhed about fifty years ſince, yet did it never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by what followed, that any conſiderable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage did ever accrue to the firſt undertakers, from this their new plantation of the eaſtern parts, unleſs by the trade of fiſh and furs, which latter continued not long; as for the former, the chief benefit redounded only to
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:014120_0234_0F9302181A1E89E8"/>them that managed it by their own particular ſtocks, and perſonal endeavors; and if without offence it may be ſpoken, the multitude of patents ſoon after granted to gentlemen of broken fortunes, have provided but places of an honorable exile or confinement, whither many deſerving perſons of better education than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, were ſent to ſhift for themſelves in a foreign land, without being further troubleſome to thoſe nearer home, on whom they had their hopes and dependance; yet it muſt not be denied but that ſome of the underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers were at vaſt expence, caſting their bread upon theſe waters, where none of their friends and relations have as yet had an opportunity to find it: The reaſon of which is not hard to give, in reference to all thoſe lands and territories that lie to the eaſtward of <hi>Piſcata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua</hi> river. One main cauſe hath been the multiplicity of grants and patents for the dividing of the ſaid tract of land, for beſides the ſtrife that hath been occaſioned by the intricacy and indiſtinctneſs of their liberties and bounds, (enough to have maintained a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of lawyers than ever were the inhabitants) if the grantees had been ſupplied with monies proportionable to their ſuits and controverſies about their bounds and juriſdictions, which ſometimes they have been ready to deſide with their ſwords, witneſs thoſe fatal names im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on ſuch accounts upon ſome places belonging to thoſe parts, as <hi>Bloody-Point, Black-Point, Blue-Point,</hi> and every conſiderable parcel of land being by patent granted to ſeveral particular perſons, hindred the erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of townſhips and villages, which if it had been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe diſpoſed of, might have been full of towns, and well peopled, and thereby the inhabitants had been able to have ſtood upon their guard, and defended themſelves againſt the common enemy, whereas now they were but like <hi>ſcopoe diſſolutoe,</hi> or like his arrows that being bound up in one bundle could not be broken by an ordinary force, but being looſe, were eaſily ſnapped aſunder by any ſingle band. Another reaſon might be, the employing of ſuch agents and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as either wanted ſkill or fidelity to manage what they were in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ſted with, which made many of the
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:014120_0235_0F93021B31225A98"/>adventurers long ago complain, that (inſtead of bills of exchange and other returns which they expected) they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived nothing but large inventories of the wants of their ſeveral plantations, and the ſervants ſent over to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pove them, which were all the returns that many of them ever received for the large ſums of money many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſed for the carrying on their affairs. A third rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may be the ſeveral changes of government the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants have paſſed under, which have occaſioned not only much vexation and expence to ſuch as were upon the place, but much diſcouragement to ſeveral others, who by the commodiouſneſs of the place would willingly have choſen ſtations in thoſe parts, had they ſeen any hope of a ſettled government ever like to be obtained; which is not hard to demonſtrate, by giving a little touch as we paſs along, on the ſeveral changes of government the places aforementioned have been moulded into, and the ſeveral proprietors that of late have claimed intereſt in the land. In the year 1624, a patent was granted by the council of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> the grand proprietors, to Capt. <hi>Maſon,</hi> for a large tract of land about <hi>Piſcataqua,</hi> but it not being diſtinctly bounded, himſelf with Sir <hi>Ferdinando Gorges,</hi> obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a joint patent in the year 1639, for the land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the eaſt of <hi>Sagadahock,</hi> and the weſt of <hi>Naumkeag,</hi> but that alſo interfering with the bounds granted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time to ſundry gentlemen and merchants that had obtained a patent from the ſouth of <hi>Charles</hi> river, to the northward of <hi>Merrimack,</hi> Capt. <hi>Maſon</hi>'s bounds were afterwards by conſent (as is ſaid) of his agent or agents, reduced to ſome branches about <hi>Piſcataqua</hi> ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver (who yet could not agree with thoſe that acted in the name of <hi>Shrewſbury</hi> men) but being wholly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected by the pretended proprietor or his ſucceſſors, (till of late days) was by the deſire of the inhabitants yielded up to the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> government, near twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years ſince.</p>
            <p>IN the year 1630, a patent was granted by the ſaid council of <hi>Plymouth</hi> (ſigned by the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi>
               <pb n="209" facs="unknown:014120_0236_0F93021C2D5D4800"/>and Sir <hi>Ferdinando Gorges,</hi> and ſealed with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſeal of the council aforeſaid) to <hi>John Dy, Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Lupe, Grace Harding,</hi> and <hi>John Roach,</hi> of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> for a large tract of land on the ſouth ſide of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadabock,</hi> forty miles ſquare by the ſea-ſide, and ſo up into the country: <hi>John Dy</hi> aforeſaid, and his partners took in another as partner and aſſociate with them, Mr. <hi>Richard Dummer,</hi> of <hi>Newbury,</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> in the year 1638, to whom they delivered the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal patent, with an order from them, and in their name to take up the land deſcribed in the patent, but he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing denied opportunity to effect it, as alſo a ſhip for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſent by the patentees for that end, not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing their deſire, they not long after ſold all their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the ſaid patent, to one Mr. <hi>Rigby,</hi> a <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> gentleman, who made Mr. <hi>Cleaves</hi> his agent to manage the buſineſs of his purchaſed intereſt in the ſaid patent; to whom Mr. <hi>Dummer</hi> was ordered to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the original patent, which accordingly he did: What trouble was occaſioned ſoon after between the ſaid Mr. <hi>Cleaves</hi> and Mr. <hi>Umes,</hi> agent for Sir <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando Gorges,</hi> is well known to the inhabitants of the place, and need not be here mentioned; nor yet how the ſaid Mr. <hi>Rigby</hi> came afterward to loſe his intereſt (at leaſt with the inhabitants) in the patent.</p>
            <p>IN the year 1632, Sir <hi>Ferdinando Gorges</hi> not reſting in the joint patent obtained for himſelf and Capt. <hi>Maſon,</hi> obtained a diſtinct patent for himſelf, and got it confirmed by King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, of bleſſed memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for all that large tract of land from <hi>Sagadahock</hi> to <hi>Piſcataqua</hi> river, and ſo about an hundred miles up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the country, by the name of the province of <hi>Maine.</hi> What benefit and improvement was ever made thereof by his agents or ſucceſſors, is beſt known to themſelves; but for the inhabitants, who upon one account or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had been induced, either by any precedaneous grant or liberty from himſelf, or his agents, to take up any land within the bounds of the ſaid province; they finding much inconvenience and trouble for want of an orderly and ſettled government, did at the laſt,
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:014120_0237_0F93021CD04E3D78"/>petition the general court of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> to be taken under their juriſdiction and government (reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the liberties and privileges of their former pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes and grants, as to title, poſſeſſion, and propriety to themſelves) which was granted them, though not only and altogether upon the grounds on which it was deſired by the petitioners. Yet notwithſtanding all this, were not things ſettled either to the comfort or content of the inhabitants: For ſometimes ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded right of juriſdiction over them, by virtue of Sir <hi>Ferdinando</hi>'s patent, ſometimes Commiſſioners em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by his Highneſs the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> attempted to ſettle a government amongſt the people; ſometimes they tried what might be done by agreement amongſt themſelves, but after their return for <hi>England,</hi> by one means or other, the government relapſed again into the hands of the <hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> although a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedeas thereunto ſeems to have been put by an order from his Majeſty this laſt year.</p>
            <p>BY theſe ſeveral viciſſitudes and changes of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the flouriſhing of the ſaid province hath been much obſtructed, which elſe might have been much advanced, and the inhabitants been put into a capacity to have ſecured themſelves againſt the late barbarous incurſions of the Indians; and poſſibly thoſe exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancies that many of the preſent proprietors have run into, to the juſt provocation of the Indians, might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by have been prevented, and ſo the miſchief alſo which hath enſued, might thereby have been averted: For a well ordered government would never have ſuffered thoſe things that now were connived at, which if they had been timely looked into by ſuch as had abſolute or poſitive and unqueſtioned power of rule in their hands, would have been otherwiſe ordered, the preſent miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief that is come upon thoſe places, might thereby have been, if not prevented, yet more eaſily re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>AS for the tract of land that lies eaſtward beyond <hi>Kennebeck,</hi> betwixt that and <hi>Pemmaquid,</hi> it is ſaid to
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:014120_0238_0F93021D695B8E10"/>have belonged to one Mr. <hi>Aldworth</hi> and his ſucceſſors, who was Alderman of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and one that had a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thereof, and employed ſome as his agents, that did ſometimes reſide upon the place, and was lately ſettled in ſome order of government by his Highneſs the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Commiſſioners, by whom alſo was an agreement made betwixt the Sagamores of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians in thoſe parts, and the Engliſh, at a court kept by their appointment in <hi>Kennebeck,</hi> which if it had been obſerved, might in all probability have prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a great meaſure the quarrel which is now fallen out betwixt the Engliſh and the ſaid Indians: For upon ſome jealouſies of the riſing of thoſe Indians about twelve or thirteen years ſince, it was agreed that if any miſchief ſhould happen to be done by the Engliſh or Indians, one againſt another, though it were to the killing any perſon, neither ſide ſhould right themſelves, but complaint ſhould be made to the Sagamores if the Indians did the wrong, and to the court if it was done by the Engliſh; both which did promiſe ſatisfaction ſhould be made for the preventing any quarrel: The names of the Sachems, as likewiſe of them that were in power at the court, do ſtill remain upon public record. But matters of government in thoſe parts being ſince collapſed, no authority more than what was merely voluntary and perſuaſive being owned, things are now brought to that miſerable ſtate which follows next to be declared.</p>
            <p>EVER ſince the firſt ſettling of any Engliſh planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in thoſe parts about <hi>Kennebeck,</hi> for the ſpace of above fifty years, the Indians always carried it fair, and held good correſpondence with the Engliſh, until the news came of <hi>Philip</hi>'s rebellion, and riſing againſt the inhabitants of <hi>Plimouth</hi> colony in the end of <hi>June,</hi> 1675; after which time it was apprehended by ſuch as had the examination of the Indians about <hi>Kennebeck,</hi> that there was a general ſurmiſe amongſt them, that they ſhould be required to aſſiſt the ſaid <hi>Philip,</hi> although they would not own that they were at all engaged in the quarrel. The like jealouſies did appear in all the
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:014120_0239_0F93021F5B338428"/>Indians that inhabited to the eaſtward of <hi>Piſcataqua,</hi> which plainly ſhews that there was a deſign of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral riſing of the Indians againſt the Engliſh all over the country (poſſibly as far as <hi>Virginia,</hi> the Indians there making inſurrections the ſame year) and that many if not moſt of them were willing it ſhould ſucceed, although the oldeſt and wiſeſt of them did not like it, fearing the iſſue, as they had cauſe: But many of the young men about <hi>Caſco Bay,</hi> and <hi>Amoſcoggan,</hi> were certainly known to flock thither the laſt year, and did, ſundry of them, come ſhort home: For herein they acted but like ſavages, as thoſe in <hi>Virginia</hi> did fifty years before, ſhewing themſelves friendly and courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to their new neighbours, till they had an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to do them miſchief. So that notwithſtanding many of the inhabitants in the eaſtern, as well as in the weſtern parts of the country, that were wont to trade with the Indians, were not willing to believe any ſuch purpoſe among them, but were ready to think ſome of the ruder ſort of the Engliſh, by their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent and irregular actions, had driven them into this rebellion; yet is it too evident that the ſaid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians (who naturally delight in bloody and deceitful actions) did lay hold of any opportunity that might ſerve as a pretence for their barbarous practices The Indians about <hi>Wammeſet</hi> and <hi>Piſcataqua,</hi> that had join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their countrymen in their riſing againſt the Engliſh the laſt winter, when they were pinched with hunger, in the cold winter following returned back to the Engliſh, and deſired to make peace, and firmly engaged to continue their wonted friendſhip; yea, ſome of them, as if they were really ſorry for their murders and cruelties, of their own voluntary motion came with the priſoners they had taken, and reſigned them up to the Engliſh, yet when their own ends were anſwered, and another opportunity was offered of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing further miſchief of a like nature, they preſently returned to their former practice, as is well known of <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Andrew,</hi> that had killed ſome, and led o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers captive the laſt ſpring from <hi>Bradford</hi> and <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verhill,</hi>
               <pb n="210" facs="unknown:014120_0240_0F93021FD5620790"/>who came in in the end of <hi>June</hi> to Major <hi>Waldern</hi>'s, bringing home Engliſh priſoners with them, yet did the very ſame Indians within leſs than two months after join with the <hi>Amoſcoggan</hi> and <hi>Kennebeck</hi> Indians, in committing the ſad tragedies that were laſt acted in thoſe parts; yet was he and his partner ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to eſcape for want of ſufficient guarding the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon where they were put, in order for further trial. But <hi>ſerò ſapiunt phryges;</hi> it is hoped that we ſhall after ſome few more experiences of this nature, learn to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of this ſubtle brood and generation of vipers. Ever ſince enmity was put between <hi>the ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and the ſeed of the ſerpent,</hi> it hath been the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her ſeed in every generation, and in every nation to meet with the ſad effects of that enmity; nor can they ever expect to find better dealing from any of the other ſort, further than either fear of their power, or hope of benefit by their favor, may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to another diſpoſition, as we the inhabitants of <hi>New-England</hi> have found by this late and ſad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in reference to theſe Pagans in the weſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom our lot is caſt, they proving, as one ſays of the Mahometans in the eaſt, like a neſt of hornets, that if any one of them chance to be provoked, they will be all about his ears that comes near them. But it is now time to begin with the particulars of the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy itſelf, that the reader account not the prologue too long. It was on the 24th of <hi>June,</hi> 1675, when the firſt miſchief was done by the Indians about <hi>Mount-Hope,</hi> before twenty days were over, the firſt fire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to kindle in theſe more remote and northerly bounds of the ſaid country, or two hundred and fifty miles diſtance, and upon this occaſion, the 11th of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> 1675, a letter was brought to <hi>Kennebeck</hi> from one <hi>Henry Sawyer,</hi> an inhabitant of <hi>York,</hi> ſignifying the news of the Indians riſing about <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and that a courſe was taken to diſarm the Indians along the ſhore.

               <hi>Kennebeck,</hi> to make diſcovery of the Indians fidelity, or elſe to fight them if there was occaſion. The third day after, marching up the river to <hi>Quegeſeck,</hi> they met with the inhabitants of <hi>Sheepſcut</hi> river, which is a river lying about twelve or fourteen miles to the north eaſt of <hi>Kennebeck.</hi> Divers of the Indians thereabouts, by the perſuaſion of one Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> that uſed to trade with them, brought down an inconſiderable part of their ammunition, as a few guns, a little powder and ſhot, with a few knives. About 7 of the <hi>Kenne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck</hi> Indians, and 5 of thoſe called <hi>Amoſcoggan</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, about <hi>Pegypſcot</hi> (a river more ſouthward towards <hi>Caſco</hi>) made this pretence of bringing in their arms. Capt. <hi>Lake,</hi> Capt. <hi>Pattiſhall,</hi> with Mr. <hi>Wiſwall,</hi> in whoſe hands was ſettled a kind of military power for thoſe parts, were ſent for further to examine the ſaid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, of whom upon examination they ſaw reaſon to ſuſpect ſome, if not all, whereupon they ſent meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers a ſecond time to the <hi>Amoſcoggan</hi> Indians, and alſo a letter to Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> to ſend down their arms and ammunition to them for their greater ſecurity. After Mr. <hi>Wiſwall</hi> was returned home, the 5 <hi>Amoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coggan</hi> Indians aforeſaid, brought in their guns, but probably with no good intent; for an Indian called <hi>Sowen,</hi> having an ax in his hand, ſtruck at one <hi>Hoſea Mallet,</hi> a Frenchman, but was prevented from doing him miſchief; however, the ſaid Indian was preſently bound and put into a cellar. Some of the Engliſh that uſed to trade with thoſe Indians were ready to excuſe the Indian, ſaying he was drunk, or that he was a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted fellow, but Mr. <hi>Wiſwall,</hi> with the other two examinants, looked upon thoſe as mere excuſes, and altogether groundleſs, for one of them to this day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms that he was as rational and ſenſible as any of the reſt.</p>

If they proved themſelves honeſt men they were to have their arms again, which was accordingly performed the laſt <hi>June,</hi> 1676; they having in the mean time carried themſelves peaceably toward the Engliſh. The day after, viz. <hi>July</hi> the 19th, 1675, an Indian of great note amongſt them, called <hi>Robbinhood,</hi> with great applauſe of the reſt, made a dance, and ſung a ſong to declare their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in what was tranſacted; and ſo they parted, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Indians at liberty that had thus engaged for their friend <hi>Sowen,</hi> the Indian; but yet to this day not one ſkin of beaver was ever paid to the Engliſh, as was promiſed; the Indians all this while were well provided for victuals by Capt. <hi>Lake,</hi> with other ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of rum and tobacco, even to the diſguſting of ſome Engliſh then preſent.</p>
            <p>BUT the Indians left as hoſtages upon <hi>Sowen</hi>'s ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, however civilly they were treated, ran all away at the laſt, truſting more to the celerity of their own feet, than to the civility of their Engliſh friends, who after they were eſcaped, joined with a parcel of their fellows ſoon after, about twenty in all, in robbing the houſe of one Mr. <hi>Purchaſe,</hi> an antient planter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

This was done in the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> 1675. Thoſe Indians that firſt aſſaulted Mr. <hi>Purchaſe</hi>'s houſe, did no other miſchief than pludering it of ſtrong liquor and ammunition, alſo killing a calf or two, with a few ſheep, but no more than what they eat, and ſpoiling a
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:014120_0243_0F930223163D0DE0"/>feather bed by ripping it open to turn out the feathers, contenting themſelves with the caſe, which they might more eaſily carry away. They offered no incivility to the miſtreſs of the houſe (her huſband and ſons being at that time from home) yet one of her ſons approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near the houſe, and finding it poſſeſſed by thoſe new inhabitants, he rode away with all ſpeed, and yet no faſter than there was need, for an Indian followed him with a gun under his coat, to have ſhot at him, if he could by his flattery and diſſembling, have got him within the reach of his piece.</p>
            <p>IT is ſaid that at the firſt they uſed fair words, and ſpoke of trading, but as they went away, told thoſe of the houſe, that there were others coming after that would deal far worſe with them, which within a ſhort time after came to paſs; for theſe were but the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of death, which was ſoon after inflicted, and that in a moſt barbarous manner upon ſundry inhabitants of the neighbouring plantations.</p>
            <p>THE Engliſh in thoſe parts being much incenſed hereat, 25 of them ſoon after going up <hi>Caſco-Bay</hi> in a ſloop and two boats to gather Indian corn, and to look to what they had upon the ſaid <hi>Bay,</hi> near <hi>Amoſcoggan</hi> river; when they came near the houſes they heard a knocking, and a noiſe about the houſes, and preſently eſpyed two or three Indians, who as yet did not ſee them. The Engliſh being come a good way from their veſſel, endeavored to get between the Indians and the woods, which when they perceived, they ran to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the water ſide, but the Engliſh in purſuit killed one of them and wounded another, who however eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped away in a canoe acroſs the river, a third running back toward the woods, fled to the other Indians, and acquainted them with what was done, who preſently came down and lay in wait to intercept the Engliſh, that thought of no danger, but ſcattered themſelves all about the place to gather their corn, and lade the boats therewith, but before they were ready to go away, the Indians coming down, fired upon them, and forced
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:014120_0244_0F93022380A17FC0"/>them all into the ſloop; had not ſome of them been better prepared than the reſt, they might all have been cut off; for ſome little reſiſtance being made by them that were ready with their guns, it gave the reſt an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to get all into the ſloop, yet not without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wounds. So with much ado, they all eſcaped with their lives, leaving the two boats a moſt laden with corn, a prey to the Indians, who preſently burnt one, and plundered the other of all that was therein; ſome are ready to think that the Engliſh did imprudently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the quarrel, and not firſt enquire into what the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians were about in the houſe, and ſeek redreſs accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the aformentioned agreement, made at the court in <hi>Kennebeck.</hi> But if this happened after what follows next to be related, viz. that which was done to old Mr. <hi>Wakely</hi> and his family, the Engliſh can be blamed for nothing but their negligence and ſecurity, in that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alarmed their enemies, they ſtood not better upon their guard, which is not very certain; for tis thought that within a few days after, or the next week, a more horrible outrage was committed upon the family of an ancient man, whoſe name was <hi>Wakely,</hi> an inhabitant of <hi>Caſco-Bay,</hi> who had ſome years before removed from <hi>Glouceſter</hi> or <hi>Cape-Ann,</hi> out of ſome diſcontent, which afterwards he often bewailed, reſolving either to have returned back, or elſe to have removed to ſome ſecurer place, but he was arreſted by the ſons of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence before he could effect his purpoſe.</p>
            <p>THIS old man, together with his wife, his ſon, and his daughter in law, (then far advanced in pregnancy) with three grand-children, were cruelly murdered by thoſe barbarous ſavages at one time; another of his grand-children was taken alive and led into captivity, a daughter of his was ſaid to be carried to <hi>Narrhagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet,</hi> which ſhews that they joined with the ſouthern In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians in the rebellion. When once theſe Indians had embrued their hands in Engliſh blood, they were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdened to the like bloody attempts in the adjacent places.</p>

THIS <hi>Wakely</hi> lived ſo far from his neighbours, or elſe was encompaſſed with creeks or rivers, that no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief could preſently be ſent to him; however, Lieut. <hi>Ingerſon,</hi> of <hi>Caſco,</hi> the next day with a file of men, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to the place where his houſe ſtood, to ſee what was the reaſon of the fire they diſcerned the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, where they found the houſe burnt to aſhes, the bodies of the old man and his wife half conſumed with the fire, the young woman killed, and three of the grand-children having their brains beat out, and their bodies laid under ſome oaken planks not far from the houſe; one girl of about 11 years old, was carried captive by them, and having been carried up and down the country ſome hundreds of miles, as far as <hi>Narrha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganſet</hi> fort, was this laſt <hi>June</hi> returned back to Major <hi>Waldern</hi>'s, by one <hi>Squando,</hi> the Sagamore of <hi>Saco;</hi> a ſtrange mixture of mercy and cruelty.</p>
            <p>SOON after, Capt. <hi>Bonithon</hi>'s and Major <hi>Phillips</hi>'s dwellings were aſſaulted, one on the eaſt, the other on the weſt ſide of <hi>Saco</hi> river. It is ſaid they had ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable notice of what was intended againſt them by their barbarous enemies, thoſe <hi>Amoſcoggan</hi> Indians, by an Indian of <hi>Saco,</hi> their neighbour, better minded than the reſt of his countrymen, who obſerving a ſtrange Indian coming to his wigwam in company with ſome of his acquaintance, one of whom informed him, after the reſt with the ſtranger were gone, that the ſaid ſtranger came from the weſtward, and that his buſineſs was to perſuade the eaſtern Indians to fall upon the Engliſh in their dwellings here, as the reſt had done to the weſtward. Capt. <hi>Bonithon,</hi> either upon this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, or upon the knowledge of what was done a little before at <hi>Caſco,</hi> had left his houſe, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired over the river with his family to Major <hi>Phillips</hi>'s garriſon. Thus two are better than one, for otherwiſe both might have been deſtroyed; for upon the 18th of <hi>September</hi> following, being the ſeventh day of the week, about 11 o'clock, thoſe at Major <hi>Phillips</hi>'s gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon ſaw Capt. <hi>Bonithon's</hi> houſe on fire, which by the good Providence of God was to them as the firing of
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:014120_0246_0F930224DDF8ED88"/>a beacon, giving them notice to look to themſelves, their enemies being now come; for otherwiſe they might, to their great diſadvantage, have been too ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſurprized, for within half an hour after they were upon them, when a ſentinel placed in the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber gave notice that he ſaw an Indian by the fence ſide near a corn field; Major <hi>Phillips,</hi> not willing to believe till he might ſee with his own eyes, ran haſtily up, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother of his men coming after, cried, Major what do you mean? do you intend to be killed; at which words he turned ſuddenly back from the window out of which he was looking, when preſently a bullet ſtruck him on the ſhoulder, grazing only upon it without breaking the bone. The Indians upon the ſhot, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had been ſlain thereby (as they heard afterwards) gave a great ſhout, upon which they diſcerned that they were ſurrounded by them, whereupon they inſtantly fired on the enemy from all quarters, and from the flankers of the fortification, ſo as they wounded the Captain of the Indians, who preſently leaving the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, retired three or four miles from the place, where he ſoon after died, as they were informed: He coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled them to leave the ſiege, but they were reſolved not ſo to quit the place; nor were thoſe within leſs reſolute to defend it: One of the beſt men was ſoon after diſabled from any further ſervice, by a wound he received in one of the vollies made upon them by the aſſailants; but that did not in the leaſt daunt the reſt of the defendants, who continued ſtill to fire upon the enemy: This diſpute laſted about an hour, after which the enemy deſpairing to take the houſe by aſſault, tho't upon a device how to burn it.</p>
            <p>FIRST, firing the houſe of one of his tenants, then his ſaw-mill, after that his corn-mill, hoping by that means to draw them out of the garriſon to put out the fire, but miſſing of their purpoſe in that, they called out, you Engliſh cowardly dogs, come out and quench the fire. They continued this ſport all the afternoon, continually almoſt without any intermiſſion firing upon them. The beſieged hoped for relief from the town,
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:014120_0247_0F9302259B651B78"/>but none came, the Major ſtill encouraging his men to hold it out, which they manfully did all that night, when they were alarmed almoſt every half hour; and between whiles they could hear their axes and other inſtruments, knocking about the mills till the next day. Thoſe within the houſe conceived they were preparing ſome engine wherewith to burn the houſe, which really was the caſe, for about four or five o'clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at the ſitting of the moon, the Major was called by his men to look out, when he ſaw a cart with four wheels, having a barricado built in the fore part to keep off ſhot, and filled with combuſtible matter, birch rinds, ſtraw, powder, andpoles 20 foot long, ready to fire the houſe; he bid them let them drive it within piſtol ſhot, before they made any ſhot againſt them; his men were a little diſcouraged at the fight of this engine; but he bid them be of good courage, and uſe means putting their truſt in God, who, he was confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent would relieve them. The cart when brought a little nearer, became unweildy by reaſon of the barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cado planted in it, and being to paſs through a ſmall gutter, one wheel ſtuck faſt in the ſlough, which bro't the cart ſuddenly to the left, whereby the drivers lay all open to their right flanker, when they fired upon them out of the ſaid flanker, and having ſo fair a ſhot upon them, and not being above piſtol ſhot from the place, they killed 6 of the enemy, and wounded 15, as they found afterwards, which no doubt made them too late to repent of their reſolution, not to follow their Captains counſel and example in leaving the ſiege; for now they preſently departed; ſo as at ſun-riſe, thoſe within the houſe eſpyed 40 of them marching away, but how many more were in the company they could not tell.</p>
            <p>THE Indians it ſeems went towards <hi>Blue Point,</hi> where it is ſaid they killed ſeveral perſons; but theſe in the houſe feared they went for more help, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected their return; but it ſeems their courage failed them as to another attempt upon an houſe ſo well
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:014120_0248_0F93022659B58330"/>garriſoned and manfully defended. Major <hi>Phillips</hi> ſent to the town for help, acquainting them with what had paſſed, but none was ſent them either that day or the next, ſo having ſpent almoſt all their ammunition, the people that were with him would not be perſuaded to tarry longer than tueſday morning, which conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him and his family to remove to the town. About a fortnight after, the Indians hearing thereof, came and burnt down the empty houſe. There were 50 perſons in the ſaid houſe during the time of the ſiege, and but 10 able hands; they had 5 more that could do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but through age or minority, not able to make any great reſiſtance; yet it pleaſed God, in whoſe hands are all mens lives and limbs, who is never wont to fail them, who in time of danger are ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in his power and goodneſs, as not to neglect the uſe of due means for their own preſervation, ſo to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der things, that not one perſon of all thoſe 50 was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther killed or mortally wounded. Major <hi>Phillips</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was wounded, but not dangerouſly, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the aſſault, his mills with other edifices were the firſt day burnt by the enemy, and ſo were all the houſes at <hi>Saco,</hi> or moſt of them ſoon after, that were above the fiſhermens ſtages. One Mrs. <hi>Hitcock</hi> being carried captive by the enemy from the ſame place, died in the winter following, by eating ſome poiſonous root inſtead of ground nuts, as was reported by the Indians afterwards.</p>
            <p>MUCH about the ſame time, five perſons going up the river of <hi>Saco,</hi> were all killed by the ſame Indians.</p>
            <p>THESE tragedies being thus acted at <hi>Caſco-Bay</hi> and <hi>Saco,</hi> thoſe barbarous enemies diſperſed themſelves in parties, intending to do all the miſchief they could to the Engliſh inhabiting about that ſide of the country. In the ſame month of <hi>September</hi> they came down to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Piſcataqua,</hi> doing the like ſpoil upon the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the ſeveral branches of that river, which they had been doing elſewhere. In the firſt place they burnt the two <hi>Cheflyes</hi> houſes about oyſter river, and killed
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:014120_0249_0F93022719B52188"/>two men that were paſſing along the river in a canoe, and carried away an old Iriſhman, with a young man taken from about <hi>Exeter,</hi> who both of them ſoon after made an eſcape to a garriſon at ſalmon falls in <hi>Kittery,</hi> by the help of an Indian better diſpoſed than the reſt, the firſt after ſeven weeks, the other after a month's captivity.</p>
            <p>ABOUT the ſame time one <hi>Goodman Robinſon,</hi> of <hi>Exeter,</hi> with his ſon, were travelling towards <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> where, as they paſſed along, they were way laid by three Indians, viz. <hi>John Sampſon, Cromwel,</hi> and <hi>John Linde,</hi> who ſhot the old man, and left him dead upon the place; his ſon, hearing the guns, eſcaped their hands by running into a ſwamp, whither the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians purſued him, but could not overtake him, ſo he got ſafe into <hi>Hampton</hi> about midnight, where he rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted what had beſel him by the way, and how narrowly he avoided the danger, intimating likewiſe, that he feared his father was killed, which was found too true, by Lieut. <hi>Saver,</hi> who the next day with 12 ſoldiers of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e poor old man ſhot through his back, the bullet hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſed through his body, and was ſtopped by the ſkin on the other ſide. Another perſon of <hi>Exeter,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Foulſam,</hi> was at the ſame time driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a pair of oxen in the ſame road, where, ſoon after he heard the report of the guns when <hi>Robinſon</hi> was killed, he eſpyed the three Indians creeping upon their bellies towards him, to do as much for him as they had done for <hi>Robinſon,</hi> but leaving his oxen, he put on his houſe with all ſpeed, and ſo was delivered from the danger that the other fell into; it is reported that one of the Indians made a ſhot at him; but he was either got out of their reach, or elſe they miſſed their aim at that time. The ſame Indians had a little before mer with another Engliſhman in thoſe woods, one <hi>Charles Randlet,</hi> whom they carried captive, although he ſoon after eſcaped out of their hands, by the help of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Indian called <hi>James.</hi> It is ſaid there were four Indians of that company, and that the fourth was ſent

            <p>WITHIN a few days after that barbarous fact at <hi>Oyſter</hi> river, two Indians, viz. one named <hi>Andrew,</hi> and the other <hi>Hopehood,</hi> the ſon of him called <hi>Robin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi> aſſaulted the houſe of one <hi>Tozer</hi> at <hi>Neweche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wannick,</hi> wherein were fifteen perſons, yet all women and children, who without all doubt had all of them fallen into the mercileſs hands of the too cruel and barbarous caitiffs, had not a young maid of about 18 years of age, firſt eſpyed them, who being endued with more courage than ordinarilly the reſt of the ſex uſe to be (the bleſſing of <hi>Jael</hi> light upon her) firſt ſhut too the door, whereby they were denied enterance till the reſt within eſcaped to the next houſe, that was better fortified; that young heroeſs kept the door faſt againſt them ſo long, till the Indians had chopped it in pieces with their hatchets, when entering the houſe, they knocked the poor maid down with their hatchets, and gave her many other wounds, leaving her for dead up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the place; after which they paſſed on toward the next dwelling, in their way meeting with two children that had eſcaped the houſe firſt broken open by them, they killed one of them, of three years old, which could not follow faſt enough, or elſe they that carried it could not convey it over a fence ſoon enough to ſave themſelves and it; and carried away the other of ſeven years old, which however was returned ſafe within half a year after. The poor maid that had ventured her uſe ſo far to ſave many others, was by a ſtrange Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:014120_0251_0F93022B2FA02B50"/>enabled to recover ſo much ſtrengh after they were gone, as to repair to the next garriſon, where ſhe was ſoon after healed of her wounds, and reſtored to perfect health again.</p>
            <p>THE next day toward night more of the barbarous enemies being gathered together, they made an aſſault upon the neighbouring dwellings. The Engliſh as many as could be ſpared out of the garriſon (not above 8 in number) purſued after them about half a mile, but night coming on, it was judged beſt to retreat, leſt otherwiſe they might have been intercepted in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home, by any of them lying in ambuſh, which is their uſual way of doing miſchief. After divers ſhot made on both ſides, but 5 of the enemy appeared; who yet took the advantage of Capt. <hi>Wincol</hi>'s abſence, (whoſe dwelling was not far off) to burn his houſe and barn, with another houſe and two barns more, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was much Engliſh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orn, ſuppoſed to be above an hundred buſhels in one of them. After they had done this miſchief they fled away. The next day after, the ſame Indians, or others of their fellows, came upon the other ſide of the river, from whence they ſhot over ſeveral times, to ſome that were grinding in the mill, but after the exchanging of many ſhot on both ſides the river betwixt them, 6 of the enemy ſhewed themſelves in the twilight, uttering ſeveral inſolent and barbarous ſpeeches, calling our men Engliſh dogs, &amp;c. yet all this while out of reach of their ſhot, and then they ran all away like dogs after they had done barking.</p>
            <p>AFTER this thoſe very Indians, as was ſuppoſed, burned 5 or 6 houſes about <hi>Oyſter</hi> river, and killed two men, viz one <hi>William Roberts,</hi> and his ſon in law. The inhabitants of <hi>Dover,</hi> with ſome other reſolute young men, being much provoked by theſe many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencies and injuries done by the enemy, obtained liberty from the Major of the regiment, to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they could not meet with ſome of the Indians, by ſecret amputhes, and ſkulking amongſt the buſhes and
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:014120_0252_0F93022B9CDF5B80"/>trees, as the Indians uſed to do with them; to which end about twenty divided themſelves into ſeveral ſmall parties: Soon after as they were looking for the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, a party of ours eſpied 5 of the Indians, ſome ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering corn in the field, while the reſt of them were buſied in heating of an oven to bake ſome of the fruit which they alſo gathered in the ſame field. The En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh were at ſuch a diſtance that they could not make any ſign to their comrades, without being diſcovered by the Indians in the field; wherefore two of them crept as near as they could to the houſe, at one end of the field, where they ſuddenly ruſhed upon two of the wretches, and knocked them down with the butt end of their muſkets, which was not done ſo ſilently, but the other three in the field took the alarm and fled away, who might elſe as eaſily as the other two have been ſurprized.</p>
            <p>THESE outrages thus daily committed, filled all the plantations about <hi>Piſcataqua</hi> with fear and confuſion; ſcarce any place where there was not reaſon for ſome to complain either of the loſs of their friends, or burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their houſes; which cauſed moſt of them that lived ſcatteringly, at any diſtance from neighbours, either to garriſon their houſes, or elſe to deſert their own dwellings, and to repair to their next neighbours that were better fortified than themſelves; but all the inhabitants in thoſe parts in general were alarmed to ſtand upon their guard.</p>
            <p>ON the 7th of <hi>October</hi> following, being a day of public humiliation, a man was ſhot down as he was riding between two garriſon houſes about <hi>Neweche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wannick,</hi> and died of his wounds two months after; about the ſame inſtant of time two young men were ſhot dead about a mile from that place; theſe two had their arms or guns with them, which were carried away by thoſe who killed them, together with their upper garments: It it not ſaid that theſe three laſt (though killed upon a day of humifiation) were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized in their repairing to, or returning from the

            <p>WHAT anſwer was returned to this importunate and pathetical letter is not fully known at preſent; moſt probably he that was moſt concerned in the contents of it was either abſent from home, or in no capacity to ſend the relief deſired, which if it could have been had, might have prevented the ſad miſchief that fell out the next day <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> when Lieut. <hi>Plaiſted</hi> being more earneſtly bent to perform that laſt office of love to his deceaſed friends, whom he could not by all his endcavours ſave from the danger of death, while they were in the land of the living, would needs venture himſelf with 20 ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers out of his garriſon, to fetch off the dead bodies.</p>
            <p>TO that end he ordered a pair of oxen to be yoked to bring them to his garriſon, in order to their chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an burial, not conſidering that the Indians lay ſkulking thereabouts, waiting for ſuch opportunities. They went firſt to the furtheſt place, where they found <hi>R. Tozer</hi>'s body, and put it in the cart, but coming back to take up the other two bodies which were fallen in a little ſwamp nearer to the garriſon, they were ſet upon by 150 of the enemy, who had hid themſelves in the buſhes, and under a ſtone wall, and logs in the way as they were to paſs; by the ſudden noiſe of the guns the cattle being frighted, ran away to the garriſon with ſuch of the dead as were firſt laid thereon (and poſſibly with one of them wounded at that inſtant) leaving their owners to fight it out with the enemy. Lieut. <hi>Plaiſted</hi> being thus deſperately aſſaulted, he with his 20 men was forced to retreat to a place of better advantage; but being there ſo warmly purſued, they were not able to abide it long, although they killed and mortally wounded ſeveral of the Indians, as themſelves have ſince confeſſed; but they moſt of them being ſo much over-matched, took the opportunity of a fair retreat,
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:014120_0255_0F93022DDF0F3F88"/>and ſo got ſafe to their garriſon, while Lieut. <hi>Plaiſted</hi> out of the height of his courage, diſdaining either to fly from, or yield himſelf (for 'tis ſaid the Indians were loth to kill him, but deſirous rather to take him pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner) into the hands of ſuch curſed caitiffs, did fight it out deſperately, till he was ſlain upon the place; his eldeſt ſon and another man were ſlain in their too late retreat, and his other ſon was ſorely wounded, ſo that he died within a few weeks after.</p>
            <p>THE Indians were contented with this miſchief for the preſent, and ſlunk away into the woods before the next day, when Captain <hi>Froſt</hi> came up from <hi>Sturgeon Creek,</hi> a few miles below the river, with a party of his friends, and buried the dead. During theſe onſets the enemy alſo took the advantage to burn three houſes and two barns before they left the place.</p>
            <p>THE latter end of the ſame month they burnt a mill near the ſame place belonging to Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon,</hi> a merchant of <hi>Boſton;</hi> from whence they came down to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Sturgeon Creek,</hi> where they burnt one houſe and killed two men not far from Captain <hi>Froſt</hi>'s dwelling, he eſcaping himſelf very narrowly, being ſhot at by the enemy, about ten in number, who might eaſily have burnt his houſe and taken all that was in it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but three boys beſides himſelf, had he not uſed this policy, to call out to ſome to march this, and the other way, to look after the Indians, as if he had had many at hand to command, which under God was the means of his eſcape; for his houſe was neither fortified, nor well manned, although far from neighbors.</p>
            <p>THE next day the ſaid Indians paſſed down the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver on <hi>Kittery</hi> ſide, killed one man, whoſe houſe they firſt plundered, and then ſet it on fire; all this was done juſt over againſt <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> from whence out of a ſmall battery was diſcharged a piece of ordnance, which by a good Providence was directed ſo to fling its ſhot, as it fell very near a party of the Indians, for they were ſo affrighted therewith (if none of them
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:014120_0256_0F93022E9A428CA8"/>were killed) that they left a good part of their plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der near the place. They were purſued by ſome of the Engliſh before they could recover their home, and by the help of the ſnow that fell about that time, were traced till they were overtaken, but being near a ſwamp eſcaped, thro' haſte leaving two of their packs behind.</p>
            <p>SOON after, they went up the river again to <hi>Quechecho,</hi> where they burnt a houſe and two or three barns.— Another party of them got over or beyond the other branches of <hi>Piſcataqua</hi> river, towards <hi>Exeter,</hi> and <hi>Lampney Eele</hi> river, where they killed one man. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them were ſeen in the woods about <hi>Exeter,</hi> and between <hi>Hampton</hi> and <hi>Exeter,</hi> where they killed one or two men in the woods as they were travelling home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, occaſioning the people of thoſe towns to ſtand continually upon their guard, which proved a great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance to the inhabitants.</p>
            <p>BUT let us look a little back to the plantations more eaſtward from <hi>Piſcataqua</hi> river, where theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages of the Indians firſt began.</p>
            <p>AT <hi>Caſco-Bay,</hi> Lieut. <hi>Ingerſon</hi>'s ſon with another man, going out a fowling about this time, were both killed before they returned home, his father's houſes being burnt, with many others alſo thereabouts.</p>
            <p>AT <hi>Black Point,</hi> Lieut. <hi>Augur</hi> with two more were aſſaulted by the Indians, where after many ſhot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed betwixt them, himſelf was ſo wounded, that he died ſoon after, and his brother alſo was killed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few days after, not far from the ſame place.</p>
            <p>WHEN the riſing of the Indians firſt began in thoſe eaſtern parts (with us called the county of <hi>Yorkſhire</hi>) Capt. <hi>Wincol</hi> of <hi>Newechewannick,</hi> with ſome others, having a ſympathy for the ſufferings of his neighbors, marched up that way with a ſmall party of men. In his firſt ſkirmiſh with the enemy he chanced to loſe two or three of his company; the reſt, not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:014120_0257_0F93022F6B945770"/>11 in all, as they were marching along by the ſea ſide were aſſaulted by a great number of the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, judged to be 150; being hard beſet with ſo great a number, they retreated to an heap of bolts that lay near the water ſide, by the ſhelter of which they lay ſafe from the enemy's guns, and ſo well played their few guns, that they ſlew many of the Indians, and put them all to a kind of rout at laſt; after which, by the help of an old canoe, they recovered ſafe to the other ſide of the bank. But nine <hi>Saco</hi> men had worſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, who came with a good intention to help their friends, upon the hearing of their guns; but as they came to reſcue Capt <hi>Wincol</hi> with his ſmall party, they themſelves fell into an ambuſh of the enemy, and ſo were all cut off, with two other men alſo, near the place where the firſt ſkirmiſh was, for the Indians from the ſhore ſide could diſcern any that were coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them when they were at a great diſtance, and ſo might eaſily way-lay them before they could come up to them. Near upon ſeven houſes were burnt about this time, and ſome perſons killed at <hi>Black Point.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TWO perſons were killed at <hi>Wells</hi> in the beginning of winter, one of them was a ſervant to Mr. <hi>William Symonds</hi> (one of the principal men in the town afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid) the gentleman himſelf with his family were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to a garriſon houſe in the middle of the town. His ſervant going early in the morning to look after ſome buſineſs there, tarried longer than was needful, to provide ſomething for himſelf, the Indians invited themſelves to breakfaſt with him, making the poor fellow pay the ſhot, when they had done, with the loſs of his life.</p>
            <p>A WEEK after one <hi>Croſs</hi> was ſlain at <hi>Wells</hi> likewiſe, who was a kind of a diſtracted fellow. Alſo one <hi>Iſaac Couſins</hi> was there killed in the beginning of winter, after there had been ſome overtures of peace between Major <hi>Waldern</hi> and the Indians.</p>
            <p>WITH ſuch kind of mutual encounters was the latter part of the year ſpent betwixt the Indians and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:014120_0258_0F93023041B11EE8"/>from <hi>Piſcataqua</hi> river to <hi>Kennebeck,</hi> from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>Auguſt</hi> to the end of <hi>November,</hi> wherein many were ſlain on both ſides; of the Engliſh in thoſe parts were ſlain upwards of fifty; the enemy loſt, as appeared afterwards by their own confeſſion, above 90, partly in the aforeſaid ſkirmiſhes, and partly in their joining with the Indians to the weſtward, whither it is ſaid, many of them were invited to repair, to help de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Engliſh, in hopes to enjoy their poſſeſſions afterwards; but God had otherwiſe determined, who did ariſe at laſt to ſave the meek ones of the earth, and plead the cauſe of his people.</p>
            <p>THE Governor and Council of <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> had at this time their hands full with the like attempts of <hi>Philip</hi> and his accomplices to the weſtward, yet were not unmindful of the deplorable condition of theſe eaſtern plantations; having committed the care there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to the Majors of the reſpective regiments of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral counties on that ſide of the country, but more eſpecially to the care and prudence of the Honorable Major <hi>D. Deniſon,</hi> Major General of the colony, a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman who by his great inſight in, and long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all martial affairs, was every way accompliſhed for the managing that whole affair; he had, to eaſe the other ſide of the country, drawn out a ſufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſoldiers from the next counties, to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced all the Indians eaſtward to their obedience; but juſt as they were intended to march up to the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarters of the Indians, to fall upon them there, viz. to <hi>Oſſapy</hi> and <hi>Pigwauchet,</hi> about an hundred miles up into the country northward, the winter ſetting in ſo ſharp and ſevere in the beginning of <hi>December,</hi> and latter end of <hi>November,</hi> it was not poſſible to have marched a day's journey into the woods without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding all their lives that ſhould venture up, the ſnow being found generally in thoſe woods four foot thick on the 10th of <hi>December,</hi> ſo as it was not poſſible for any to have travelled that way unleſs they carried rackets under their feet, wherewith to walk upon the top of the ſnow: This only conſideration forced them to lay
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:014120_0259_0F930230DABC48B8"/>aſide their deſign for the preſent, but ſoon after it was done to their hands; for the depth of the ſnow, and ſharpneſs of the cold, were ſo extream, that the Indians in thoſe parts were ſo pinched therewith, that being ſtarved they began to ſue for peace, making their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs firſt to Major <hi>Waldern</hi> on that account, by whoſe mediations that whole body of Indians eaſtward were brought to an hopeful concluſion of peace, which was mutually agreed upon, and poſſibly might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained firm enough to this day, had there not been too juſt an occaſion given for the breaking of the ſame, by the wicked practice of ſome lewd perſons which opened the door, and made way for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all thoſe ſad calamities and miſchieſs that have ſince fallen upon thoſe parts of the country, as ſhall hereafter be declared.</p>
            <p>IN the latter end of <hi>June,</hi> 1676, the Indians that had made a general conſpiracy againſt the Engliſh. were ſtrangely diſperſed and diſpirited, ſo that they from that time began to ſeparate one from another, and every nation of them to ſhift for themſelves, as hath already been mentioned in the former part of this nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative. <hi>Canonicus,</hi> the great Sachem of the <hi>Narrha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganſets,</hi> diſtruſting the proffers of the Engliſh, was ſlain in the woods by the <hi>Mobawks,</hi> his Squaw ſurrender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herſelf, by this means her life was ſpared.</p>
            <p>MANY of thoſe about <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and the places ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining thereto, did cunningly endeavour to hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves amongſt thoſe Indians about <hi>Piſcataqua,</hi> that had newly made their ſubmiſſion to the Engliſh, by Major <hi>Waldern</hi>'s means, and concluded a peace, yee could neither diſſemble their nature and diſpoſition paſt before from ſuſpicion of miſchief, nor yet ſo artiſicially conceal their perſons, but they were eaſily diſcerned by ſuch as in former times had any acquaintance with the eaſtern Indians by way of trade, or other converſe: Whereupon the forces newly raiſed in the <hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> under the command of Capt. <hi>William H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="230" facs="unknown:014120_0260_0F930231CA9175A8"/>Capt. <hi>Joſeph Sill,</hi> deſigned for the ſubduing of thoſe Indians about the river of <hi>Merrimack</hi> and <hi>Piſcataqua,</hi> that ſtill ſtood out in hoſtility againſt the Engliſh, meeting with thoſe under the command of Major <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern</hi> aforeſaid, and Capt. <hi>Froſt</hi> of <hi>Kittery;</hi> it was mutually agreed betwixt thoſe ſeveral commanders to ſeize upon all thoſe Indians that at that time were met together about Major <hi>Waldern</hi>'s dwelling at <hi>Quechecho;</hi> the deſign ſucceeded according to expectation, and all the Indians were handſomely ſurprized the 6th of <hi>September,</hi> 1676, without the loſs of any perſons life, either Indian or Engliſh; to the number of near 400; by which device, after our forces had them all in their hands, they ſeparated the peaceable from the perfidious, that had been our enemies during the late troubles; finding above 200 involved in the former rebellion, more or leſs, they accordingly were ſent down to the Governor and Council at <hi>Boſton,</hi> who adjudged 7 or 8 of them immediately to die; ſuch as were known to have had their hands in the blood of the Engliſh, or that had been ſhed by their means; the reſt that were found only acceſſaries to the late miſchiefs, had their lives ſpared, but were ſent into other parts of the world to try the difference between the friendſhip of their neighbours here, and their ſervice with other maſters elſewhere.</p>
            <p>THOSE who had been always peaceable and true to the Engliſh, never intermeddling in the quarrel, as <hi>Wannalancet,</hi> the Sagamore of <hi>Pennicook,</hi> and ſome others, were quietly diſmiſſed to their own places. Beſides thoſe that were ſurprized at the time aforeſaid, there were ſeveral others who had been the chief actors, that were taken up and down in thoſe woods beyond <hi>Merrimack,</hi> and ſo were delivered up to juſtice; as <hi>John Manoco,</hi> Sagamore <hi>Sam,</hi> old <hi>Jethro,</hi> with ſome others, as hath been already mentioned, yet young <hi>Jethro</hi> brought in 40 at one time. It was a ſpecial <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>vor from God ſo to order it, that the Indians afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, were ſo ſurprized; for had they continued in their former rebellion, and had taken the opportunity
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:014120_0261_0F930233B9297410"/>to have joined with the eaſtern Indians, as ſome of them did a few months before, they would in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood have utterly deſtroyed all the plantations of the Engliſh beyond <hi>Piſcataqua</hi> river, as manifeſtly appears by the miſchief which was lately done by means of a few, that by too much connivance of ſome in thoſe parts, that entertained a better opinion of them than it ſeems they deſerved. For whereas mention was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly made of a ſmall party of Indians, that on the 3d day of <hi>May,</hi> in this preſent year, had murdered one <hi>Thomas Kembel,</hi> of <hi>Bradford,</hi> and carried away his wife and 5 children captive; yet two or three of the actors did, upon what conſideration is not known, return the woman and children again within ſix weeks, and becauſe of their voluntarily returning of them, were dealt more favorably with; being only put into priſon at <hi>Dover,</hi> for a time; yet poſſibly conceiving that a priſon was but a preparation for a worſe evil, they took an opportunity (two of the chief actors in the aforeſaid miſchief, one called <hi>Simon,</hi> the other <hi>Andrew</hi>) to convey themſelves out of the place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, and afterwards going amongſt the <hi>Amoſcoggan</hi> and <hi>Kennebeck</hi> Indians, have joined with them in thoſe bloody and cruel depredations lately made in thoſe parts, which follow in order next to be related.</p>
            <p>SOME little colour or pretence of injury was alledged before thoſe eaſtern Indians began their outrage, both in the former, as well as in the preſent year; the chief actor or rather the beginner of all the aforeſaid miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs eaſtward, is one <hi>Squande,</hi> the Sagamore of <hi>Saco</hi> Indians, whoſe Squaw, as is ſaid, was abuſed by a rude and indiſcreet act of ſome Engliſh ſeaman, the laſt ſummer, 1675, who either overſet the canoe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſaid ſquaw with her child were ſailing in a river thereabouts, or elſe to try whether the children of the Indians as they had heard, could ſwim as naturally as any other creatures, wittingly caſt her child into the water; but the ſquaw immediately diving into the water after it, fetched it up from the bottom of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, yet it ſo falling out that within a while after the
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:014120_0262_0F930233F4B4BCA0"/>ſaid child died (which it might have done if no ſuch affront had been offered) the ſaid <hi>Squando,</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the child, hath been ſo provoked thereat, that he hath ever ſince ſet himſelf to do all the miſchief he can to the Engliſh in thoſe parts, and was never as yet, ſince that time, truly willing to be reconciled, although he is ſaid to have ſent home ſome that were taken cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive the laſt year. Surely if their hearts had not been ſecretly filled with malice and revenge before, they might have obtained ſatisfaction for the wrong done at an eaſier rate; more probable it is that this was only an occaſion to vent the miſchief they had formerly conceived in their hearts.</p>
            <p>THERE is an injury of an higher nature, mentioned as the ground of their quarrel with us who live about <hi>Pemmaquid</hi> and <hi>Kennebeck,</hi> which happened the laſt ſpring, viz. one <hi>Laughton,</hi> with another perſon or more, who having obtained under the hand of Major <hi>Waldern,</hi> a warrant to ſeize any Indians eaſtward that had been guilty of any murder or ſpoil done to the Engliſh in thoſe parts, did (moſt perfidiouſly and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly entice ſome of the Indians about <hi>Cape Sables,</hi> who never had been in the leaſt manner guilty of any injury done to the Engliſh) on board their veſſel, or elſe ſome other way, and then carried them away to fell them for ſlaves; which the Indians in thoſe parts look upon as an injury done to themſelves, and have alledged it to the inhabitants of <hi>Pemmaquid,</hi> as one of the principal grounds of their preſent quarrel: The thing alledged is too true as to matter of fact, and the perſons that did it were lately committed to priſon in order to their further trial. Yet all thoſe Indians do, or may know full well, that they who did them that wrong, were liable to due puniſhment (or elſe their quarrel might be uncounted juſt, and they conſidered as Indians, muſt have the more allowance) if they could be found, nor ever were any countenanced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, that had done them any kind of injury, nor did thoſe that take upon them the revenging of the injury, know that they were inhabitants of this
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:014120_0263_0F930234A44D1B28"/>country that did the wrong; nor was there ever any orderly complaint made thereof; but this cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe their perfidiouſneſs and cruelty. Some other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences alledged by the ſaid Indians that yet do bear no proportion to the mention of a wrong or injury, viz. becauſe our traders were forbidden to fell any ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to any Indians whatſoever; which thoſe Indians ſay they cannot live without; yet ſeeing they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as well as the weſtward Indians have ſo ill im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved that which they had before, there was little reaſon why they ſhould quarrel with us for felling no more.</p>
            <p>FURTHER alſo, it is affirmed by ſome perſons wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of credit, that for divers years paſt have lived in thoſe parts, that the Indians thereabouts need not have wanted powder or ſhot, only they wanted ſomething wherewith to cloak their malicious and barbarous practices of late committed againſt us; but there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing different opinions about this point, we ſhall leave it for the preſent. But this being premiſed in reference to the pretended ground, or occaſion of the quarrel, it remains that the effects thereof be now related.</p>
            <p>BEFORE the war with <hi>Philip</hi> was well ended to the ſouthward, there was a freſh alarm founded again to the eaſtward; for on the 11th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1676, the very day before <hi>Philip</hi>'s heart, that had harboured ſo many miſchievous and treacherous devices againſt the Engliſh, was by one of his own company ſhot through, a party of Indians began their outrages at <hi>Caſco</hi> in a moſt perfidious and treacherous manner, killing and carring away captive, to the number of 30 perſons, and burning their houſes; amongſt whom was the family of one <hi>Anthory Bracket,</hi> an inhabitant of <hi>Caſco,</hi> who was thought to have been killed, but he himſelf, with his wife, and one of his five children car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away captive, with a negro, did happily make an eſcape from their bloody and deceitful hands, in <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> next enſuing.</p>

THE manner how <hi>Anthony Bracket</hi> and his wife made their eſcape was very remarkable, and therefore judged worthy to be here inſerted, although out of due place. The Indians that led them captive, having brought them to the north ſide of <hi>Caſco Bay,</hi> news was brought to the ſaid Indians of the ſurprizal of <hi>Arowſick</hi> houſe, in <hi>Kennebeck,</hi> with all the ſtores therein, which did ſo rejoice them, that they made all haſte to ſhare in the good things there to be had: Thus eager to be gone, they promiſed <hi>Bracket</hi> and his wife that they alſo ſhould have a ſhare therein if they would make haſte after them, bringing along a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then alloted to each of them: The woman having a little before obſerved an old birch canoe lying by the water ſide, hoped it was an opportunity Providence offered for their eſcape; whereupon ſhe firſt prudently aſked the Indians to let the negro, their own ſervant (at the ſame time carried captive by them) help them to carry their burthens, which was granted; then ſhe begged of them a piece or two of meat, which was not denyed them. Thus being furniſhed with help and proviſion, the Indians leaving them behind to come after with their ſeveral burthens, and a young child, they could not but look upon it as a <hi>nutrus Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinus,</hi> to bid them ſhift for themſelves: The woman alſo found a needle and thread in the houſe, with which ſhe mended the canoe, while they tarried on that ſide of the bay, in which they ſoon ventured to get away, which proſperouſly ſucceeded; for in that old canoe they croſſed a water eight or nine miles broad, and when they came on the ſouth ſide of the bay, they might have been in as much danger of other Indians, that had lately been about <hi>Black-Point,</hi> and had taken it; but they were newly gone: So things on all ſides thus concurring to help forward their deliverance, they came ſafely to the fat at <hi>Black-Point,</hi> where alſo by ſpecial Providence they met with a veſſel bound for <hi>Piſcataqua.</hi> that came into that harbour but a few hours before they came thither, by which means they attived ſafe in <hi>Piſcataqua</hi> river ſoon after; all which circumſtances are very worthy to be noted.</p>

AMONGST thoſe Indians that ſeized this <hi>Bracket</hi>'s family, the Chief was one <hi>Simon,</hi> who had but a little before eſcaped out of <hi>Dover</hi> priſon, where he was not carefully overlooked; he had had his hand in the murder of ſundry Engliſh, as he had confeſſed; not miſſing any, ſave one, on whom he had diſcharged his gun; but becauſe he came in voluntarily, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a woman and 5 children of the Engliſh, who had been carried captive a little before, it was queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether his laſt act of ſubmiſſion might not balance his former tranſgreſſion, and therefore he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to that, not ſo ſecure a priſon, till his caſe might be further conſidered of. It is ſaid that coming to that <hi>Bracket</hi>'s houſe over night, he pulled forth a counterfeited paſs, under the hands of ſome public officers, or men intruſted with that ſervice, making ſhew of all friendſhip; but in the morning, or ſoon after, he pulled off the vizor of a friend, and diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what he was; yet granting life to this perſon and his family, that did not, or could not reſiſt, which he denied to ſomeof the neighbours not far off, who were many of them killed by this bloody villian and his partners.</p>
            <p>THERE are ſome circumſtances in the aſſault of <hi>Anthony Bracket</hi>'s houſe very conſiderable, which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was the firſt outrage committed by the Indians in this their ſecond inſurrection, 1676, are worthy of a more particular remembering.</p>
            <p>THIS Indian beforementioned, called <hi>Simon,</hi> after he had eſcaped out of the priſon at <hi>Dover,</hi> came to <hi>Caſco,</hi> and either in the end of <hi>July</hi> or beginning of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> acquainted himſelf with this <hi>Anthony Bracket,</hi> and oft frequented his houſe. Upon the 9th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> ſome of the Indians having killed a cow of his, the Indian <hi>Simon</hi> coming to his houſe promiſed to bring the Indians to him that had killed his cow. In the mean time they of the place ſent two men to Major <hi>Waldern</hi>'s at <hi>Dover,</hi> to complain of this injury done by the Indians, but before their return, very early in
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:014120_0266_0F930236D89F2578"/>the morning on the 11th of <hi>Auguſt, Simon</hi> with a party of Indians came to <hi>Anthony Bracket</hi>'s houſe, and told him there were the Indians that had killed his cow; but as ſoon as they had ſaid that, the Indians went further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his houſe and took hold of all the guns they could ſee; <hi>Bracket</hi> aſked what was the meaning of that, <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> replied, that ſo it muſt be, aſking him withal, whether he had rather ſerve the Indians, or be ſlain by them, to which he anſwered, that if the caſe were ſo, he would rather chuſe to ſerve them than be killed by them; <hi>Simon</hi> replied, that then they muſt be bound, which was preſently done. The ſaid <hi>Bracket,</hi> his wife, and a negro were all bound by the Indians; his wife and a brother, who offering to reſiſt was killed forthwith, the reſt, with five children were led away priſoners.</p>
            <p>TWO hours after, one <hi>Pike,</hi> that lived not far off, but knowing nothing of all this, went up in a canoe toward one <hi>Robert Corbin</hi>'s houſe, where he found one <hi>Humphry Durham</hi> and <hi>Benjamin At<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>el</hi> at work about their hay; after a little ſtay, he loſt them, intending to go up higher with his canoe. but as ſoon as he was a little paſt, he heard the report of guns, which made him with another man he had with him preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn back; before he came beyond <hi>Corban</hi>'s houſe he ſaw an Engliſh boy running with all haſte, which made him fear ſome miſchief was in hand, and preſently a volley of ſhot came againſt them, but the bullets flying over their heads, did them no hurt; preſently <hi>Simon</hi> appeared, and called them to come on ſhore; but they liked not his courteſy, and turning their canoe into the ſtream, got out of the reach of their guns, haſting down to his own houſe with all ſpeed; when he came near to his houſe, he called to the people to make haſte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way towards the garriſon-houſe, and bid the reſt look to themſelves, and fire upon the Indians that were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt them: In the mean while the Indians paſſing from <hi>Anthony Bracket</hi>'s to <hi>Corban</hi>'s, killed <hi>Corban</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, together with <hi>Humph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y Durham</hi> and <hi>Benjamin At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> beforementioned; then paſſing on to other houſes,
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:014120_0267_0F930239DBB9C358"/>killed ſome, and carried others away captive. At one of the next houſes the women and children got off into the water by a canoe; but one <hi>James Roſs,</hi> his wife and children were carried away. <hi>Corban</hi>'s wife, with one of the other men's wives, and the children of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they carried away likewiſe.</p>
            <p>IN another ſide of the town as three perſons were going to reap at <hi>Anthony Bracket</hi>'s, paſſing from an houſe where they left their canoe, met with <hi>John Mountjoy</hi> and one <hi>Wakely,</hi> to whom they told what had happened, ſoon after they heard two guns fired, whereby it ſeems two men were killed; wherefore coming back toward <hi>Thomas Bracket</hi>'s, where they had left their canoe, they ſaw him ſhot down by the Indians; one of the three not ſo well able to run, hid himſelf in the buſhes in hope to make his eſcape more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently afterwards, which accordingly he did; but in the mean time he ſaw the Indians carry away <hi>Thomas Brac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket</hi>'s wife and children. Soon after the three men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, got ſafe to Mr. <hi>Mountjoy</hi>'s garriſon, but not truſting to the ſecurity of that garriſon, they ſoon after repaired to an iſland in the bay, called <hi>James Andrew</hi>'s iſland. One <hi>George Lewis</hi> and his wife tarried all this time in their houſe till the next day, when they had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to get ſafe to the iſland aforeſaid, together with the two men that were now returned from Major <hi>Waldern;</hi> whither they had been ſent, but too late, to make complaint of the Indians that had counterfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his paſs to travel into thoſe parts, and had done this miſchief.</p>
            <p>THE day after, one <hi>George Felt,</hi> ſuſpecting the worſt by reaſon of a ſmoke he ſaw on the oppoſite ſide of the town, took his wife and children into a canoe to ſee what the matter was, but when he came near a point of land not far off, he found ſeveral of his neighbors goods, which made him conclude their owners were killed, which was a ſufficient warning to him likewiſe to fly for his life, which he did to the ſame iſland. After a number of them had eſcaped thither, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:014120_0268_0F93023AD97983D0"/>that they had left powder behind them in one or two places; whereupon they determined to venture a party of them in the night, to prevent the Indians from having any advantage thereby, and for their own defence if occaſion ſhould require; accordingly their attempt ſucceeded well, for they brought away a barrel of powder from one <hi>Well</hi>'s houſe, and likewiſe a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable quantity out of a cheſt in a ſtore houſe, where the Indians had been ranſacking, and had taken things out of the other end of the cheſt, yet overlooked the powder. In this ſurprizal of the plantation in <hi>Caſco-Bay,</hi> called <hi>Falmouth,</hi> there were 34 perſons killed and carried into captivity.</p>
            <p>THAT this was not a caſual attempt, but a deſigned plot, will appear, in that juſt about the ſame time, the Indians at <hi>Kennebeck</hi> made the like inſurrection, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is concluded, either that the Indians which eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped from <hi>Dover</hi> ſtirred them up thereunto, or elſe that the ſaid Indians finding them in a diſpoſition tending that way, by reaſon of ſome injuries done thoſe that dwell farther northward, they offered their ſervice to help forward the deſign.</p>
            <p>IT is to be noted here that the Indians about <hi>Kenne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck</hi> were perſuaded to continue their former amity with the Engliſh, notwithſtanding the report of <hi>Philip</hi>'s riſing that year before, and the outrages committed the laſt autumn and winter following; yet which is more, they had lately renewed their league with the Engliſh in thoſe parts, although they had often complained to thoſe of <hi>Pemmaquid,</hi> of the injury they ſuffered in the with-holding from them the trade of powder and ſhot, without which they ſaid they could not ſubſiſt, and for want of which, it is alledged by themſelves, that ſome of them periſhed the laſt winter.</p>
            <p>BUT the quarrel of late fallen out betwixt the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh and the Indians about <hi>Kennebeck</hi> and eaſtward thereof, being a matter of great importance, it ſhall, for the ſatisfaction of the reader, in what follows be
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:014120_0269_0F93023B7B528218"/>more particularly deſcribed, it being the duty of every one that publiſheth things of this nature, to do the right of an hiſtorian to all who are any ways concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in what is made public. The information was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from a prudent perſon, an eye and ear witneſs of all that happened amongſt the ſaid Indians both the former and the preſent year, and one that was more publickly concerned in thoſe tranſactions than ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, therefore the more credit may be given thereto.</p>
            <p>MENTION is already made of what happened in <hi>September,</hi> 1675, to the company belonging to a ſloop and two boats that went up <hi>Caſco-Bay</hi> to gather corn. upon that accident it is ſaid divers Indians on the eaſt ſide of <hi>Kennebeck</hi> river repaired to their fort at <hi>Toton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock</hi> (a place higher up into the country beyond <hi>Kenne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck</hi> and <hi>Sheepſcot</hi> river) where was an Engliſh trading houſe: And the Indians eaſtward of ſaid river, had as yet done no harm to any of the Engliſh, yet did Capt. <hi>Sylvanus Davis,</hi> agent for Major <hi>Clarke</hi> and Capt. <hi>Lake</hi> of <hi>Boſton,</hi> upon theſe overtures think fit to fetch down the powder and ſhot, with other goods from the ſaid trading houſe, telling the Indians, by the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger ſent up, he would have them come down and live below in that river, to take off jealouſies, and that he would then ſopply them with what was needful.— But the meſſenger told them in caſe they would not come down and deliver up their arms the Engliſh would kill them. <hi>He that ſendeth a meſſage by the hand of a fool,</hi> faith Solomon, <hi>cutteth off the foet, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth damage.</hi> This meſſage was delivered by him as he afterwards confeſſed, but who put it into his mouth, or whether it was the device of his own heart, does not at preſent concern us to enquire, but the damage that ſide of the country hath ſuſtained thereby is not eaſy to recount; for upon this threatning meſſage the Indians forſook their fort and went further eaſtward, and ſent abroad to <hi>John</hi>'s river and to the ſea ſide, to get all the Indians they could together to come up <hi>Penobſcot</hi> river.</p>

A GENTLEMAN who at that time lived at <hi>Pemma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid,</hi> a kind of ſuperintendent over the affairs of that place, conſidering the ſad ſtate things were running in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, laboured to obtain a parly with the ſaid Indians, or with ſome of them, which after much trouble and coſt he did accompliſh. But in the mean time, ſuch was the violence uſed by ſome refractory Engliſh in thoſe parts, that they could ſcarce be reſtrained from offering violence to the perſons he ſent up as meſſengers, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that lived quietly amongſt them, and did alſo as violently ſet themſelves up to oppoſe him or any others that acted with more moderation than the reſt; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting againſt them as thoſe who for gain ſupplyed the Indians with powder and ſhot, and ſaid they would kill any Indian they met; others at <hi>Monhiggon</hi> offered five pounds for every Indian that ſhould be brought, yet would not theſe perſons that were ſo violent againſt the Indians in their diſcourſe, be perſuaded then or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to go out to fight the Indians in an orderly way, as appeared both by their ſecurity in not acting better upon their guard, and by their ſudden flight af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, running away like a flock of ſheep, at the barking of any little dog. Things being in this poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, what could be expected but a preſent war with the Indians, although as it ſeems, there were few or none to be found willing to undertake it, or fit to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage it in thoſe parts. However, the perſon aforeſaid underſtanding the general court at <hi>Boſton</hi> had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a council of war at <hi>Kennebeck,</hi> applied himſelf to them, laying before them the deſperate ſtate things were falling into; whereupon they iſſued out warrants to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain all manner of perſons from meddling with the Indians without further order, which within a few days ſhould be had. In the mean time the Sachems of the Indians met at <hi>Pemmaquid,</hi> where after many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints made of the hard dealing of the Engliſh in <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebeck</hi> river, they came to terms of peace, promiſing to keep true friendſhip with the Engliſh, and to hinder the <hi>Amoſcoggan</hi> Indians from meddling with the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, if by any means the could, and alſo to return peaceably in the ſpring of the year. This gentleman
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:014120_0271_0F93023CE3275FD8"/>aforeſaid, having a long time waited to go to <hi>Boſton,</hi> was willing to take the opportunity of the preſent win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hoping things were now pretty well ſettled in thoſe parts between the Indians and the Engliſh, found ſoon after that he was cited thither to anſwer ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, though ill grounded, for ſelling powder and ſhot to the Indians contrary to order. But thoſe falſe opinions being eaſily blown away by his own appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at <hi>Boſton,</hi> and having diſpatched his buſineſs there, he returned before the winter was over to <hi>Pemmaquid,</hi> where hearing of a veſſel that intended to take Indians in thoſe parts and carry them away to market, which he had many ſtrong reaſons to believe, (it being no hard matter to ſurprize many ſuch, that ſuſpecting no fraud, would eaſily be enticed aboard a veſſel to trade, or may be to drink liquor) ſent to both the maſter and company, if they had any ſuch intent, to forbear, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe Indians were at peace with us; and likewiſe to the Indians, to inform them of ſuch a veſſel, and to be aware thereof; but yet it ſeems the maſter and company took ſeveral Indians eaſtward, who were alſo at peace with us, and to our great ſorrow ſhipt them on board for a market.</p>
            <p>THE winter being now over, the aforementioned agent of <hi>Pemmaquid</hi> went to a meeting of the Indians eaſtward, to perſuade them of the country's willingneſs to continue a peace with them. They ſeemed very joyful thereat, and in the ſpring brought ſome preſents to confirm the peace, and to that end alſo delivered up an Engliſh captive boy to thoſe of <hi>Kennebeck.</hi> But when the ſummer came on, the ſaid Indians having li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to travel up and down the country to viſit their friends as they uſed to do, they miſſed many of them, who had in the winter been perfidiouſly carried away. and as is related, they fell into a rage againſt the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, making complaint thereof to the ſaid agent, Mr. <hi>Earthy,</hi> Mr. <hi>Richard Oliver,</hi> and others. They were told means ſhould be uſed for bringing them back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, which had been ſo tranſported. Thoſe to whom
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:014120_0272_0F93023D9E55B388"/>the complaint was made, did ſcarce believe it to be true, not having heard thereof from any other hand, and probably hoping none, eſpecially after ſuch ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn warning, would deal ſo perfidiouſly with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, to lay ſuch a ſtumbling block before them.</p>
            <p>THE Indians being certain of the thing done, could not be eaſily pacified, being likewiſe incenſed againſt the Engliſh for with-holding the trade of powder and ſhot the laſt winter, ſaying they were frighted from their corn the laſt year by the people about <hi>Kennebeck,</hi> inſomuch that many of them died in the following win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for want of powder and ſhot wherewith to kill veniſon and foul; adding withal, that if the Engliſh were their friends as they pretended, they would not ſuffer them to die for want thereof. However, the ſaid agent making the beſt he could of a bad cauſe, uſed all means to pacify the complainants, and to that end promiſed them that if they would meet with any of the <hi>Amoſcoggan</hi> Indians (who had all along the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt enmity againſt the Engliſh) he would give them a meeting to treat in order to a peace, Major <hi>Waldern</hi> having already concluded a peace with the <hi>Piſcataqua</hi> and <hi>Caſco</hi> Indians, and by that means, if they could conclude the like peace with the <hi>Amoſcoggan</hi> men (that could not yet be found) there would be a general peace with all the Indians eaſtward of <hi>Piſcataqua,</hi> which the Indians that were preſent at this diſcourſe ſeemed very joyful at. Yet ſtill by one fatal accident or another, j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Soon after comes a poſt from <hi>Tetonnock,</hi> to deſire him to repair thither according to his promiſe, where they told him he ſhould meet <hi>Squando,</hi> and divers <hi>Amoſcoggan</hi> Sachems, and that <hi>Mug</hi> was ſent poſt to fetch the ſaid <hi>Squando.</hi> This gentleman, mindful of his promiſe, went with the poſt to <hi>Kennebeck,</hi> finding Capt. <hi>Lake</hi> at his houſe in <hi>Arowſick.</hi> It was judged meet that Captain <hi>Sylveſter Davis</hi> ſhould go along with him, with inſtructions from
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:014120_0273_0F93023E63DA7B68"/>the council then ſitting in <hi>Kennebeck,</hi> how to carry on their treaty. After they had gone part of the way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Totonnock,</hi> they came to an Engliſh houſe, where they were cold what great jealouſies of deceit in the Indians were upon their ſpirits, from what they had heard of <hi>Mug,</hi> and <hi>Tarumkin,</hi> an <hi>Amoſcoggan</hi> Sachem. Going further, to a place called <hi>Kedonucook,</hi> they met with Indians, who were very ſhy of telling them any thing; which, added to their former intimation, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increaſed their fears; but being reſolved on their voyage, they proceeded in their way thither, yet failing ſhort of the place on purpoſe, that they might finiſh their buſineſs with them the next day. When they came to their fort, they were firſt faluted with a volley of ſhot, then brought into a wigwam where their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chems were: <hi>Madockawando</hi> ſat as chief, who now ſtiles himſelf their miniſter. Being ſet in council, they made <hi>Aſſiminalqua</hi> their ſpeaker, whoſe adopted ſon was the ſaid <hi>Madockawando:</hi> He told them it was not their cuſtom, if any came as meſſengers to treat with them, to ſeize upon their perſons, as ſometimes the <hi>Mobawks</hi> did with ſuch as had been ſent to them: Capt. <hi>Davis,</hi> and the other gentleman told them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they dealt like men; anſwer was preſently made them, you did otherwiſe by our men, when 14 came to treat with you, and ſet a guard over them, and took away their guns; and not only ſo, but a ſecond time you required our guns, and demanded us to come down unto you, or elſe you would kill us, which was the cauſe of our leaving both our fort and corn, to our great loſs.</p>
            <p>IT was without doubt no ſmall trouble to their minds, in a treaty with theſe Pagans, <hi>baec diei potuiſſe, and non potuiſſe refelli:</hi> Yet to put the beſt conſtruction might be, on ſuch irregular actions, which could not well be juſtified, they told them the perſons who had ſo done, were not within the limits of their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and therefore though they could not call them to an account for ſo acting, yet they did utterly diſallow thereof; adding further, as ſoon as we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:014120_0274_0F93023F1CACC260"/>thereof, we ſent for you to <hi>Pemmaquid,</hi> and treated you kindly, and kept you, as you know, from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Engliſh; the Indians replied, we do but inform you, and will treat further in the afternoon; but when the afternoon came, our two meſſengers told them their buſineſs was to treat with the <hi>Amoſcog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> Sachems, and that they were ſorry <hi>Squando</hi> was not there; then having confirmed their peace with thoſe eaſtward Indians, they intreated the <hi>Amoſcoggan</hi> men to ſpeak, who likewiſe urged <hi>Tarumkin,</hi> the chief <hi>Amoſcoggan</hi> Sachem to ſpeak, who after ſome pauſe, ſaid he had been to the weſtward, where he had found many Indians unwilling for peace; but ſays he, I found three Sachems (whom he named, though thoſe he ſpake to knew them not) willing to have peace; and for my own part I am willing for peace, and give them his hand, with proteſtation of his continuing in friendſhip; ſo did 7 or 8 more of the <hi>Amoſcoggan</hi> men; whoſe names they took, of whom <hi>Mug</hi> and <hi>Robinhood</hi>'s ſon were two. After this <hi>Madockawando</hi> aſked them what they ſhould do for powder and ſhot, when they had eat up their Indian corn, what they ſhould do for the winter, for their hunting voyages; aſking withal, whether they would have them die, or leave their country, and go all over to the French. Our meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers told him, they would do what they could with the Governor, ſome might be allowed them for neceſſity: He ſaid they had waited long already, and therefore would have them now, ſay yea or nay, whether they ſhould have powder as formerly, or not: Our meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers then replied, you yourſelves ſay many of the weftern Indians would not have peace, and therefore if we fell you powder, and you give it to the weſtern men, what do we but cut our own throats? Adding further, it is not in our power without leave, if you ſhould wait ten years more, to let you have powder, at which words they ſeemed much to be offended.</p>
            <p>BUT yet the next day they reſolved to go down with them, and to ſpeak with the weſtern men, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, if it might be, to ſtop their further proceeding.</p>

SO going down with them the next day, they met with ſome Indians who had got ſtrong liqour, with whom they fell a drinking; our meſſengers ſtayed at two places for them, and finding that ſtill they tarried behind, not knowing what farther to do, they went home, it being the ſixth day of the week; but the next night ſave one, news came to <hi>Kennebeck,</hi> that the Indians had killed divers Engliſh in <hi>Caſco,</hi> although it was not yet known at <hi>Pemmaquid:</hi> Upon this news Capt. <hi>Davis</hi> ſet out one ſentinel the next night; the reſt (ſuch was their ſecurity) went all to bed, and in the morning were all like <hi>Laiſh</hi> ſurprized; thus might it be ſaid, <hi>Invadunt AEdem ſomno (ſinon) vino<expan>

            <p>UPON the 13th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1676, ſeveral Indians repaired in the evening to the houſe of one Mr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> an ancient inhabitant, and trader with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians up <hi>Kennebeck</hi> river; his daughter, or a maid that was ſervant in the houſe, either naturally afraid of the natives, or elſe from ſomething ſhe obſerved in their countenance or carriage, manifeſted ſo much ſear, as made her run out of the houſe to hide herſelf in ſome place abroad; the Indians perceiving it, the more to diſſemble their treachery, ran after her, and brought her into the houſe, telling her (although they could not perſuade her ſo to believe) that there was no reaſon to be afraid of them; preſently after more of the barbarous villians coming into the houſe, ſhe grew more afraid than before, being now more ſtrongly perſuaded that they came on purpoſe to kill or ſurprize thoſe in the family, whereupon ſhe ſuddenly made an eſcape out the houſe, and preſently paſſed into a field of Indian corn, whereby ſhe might the better avoid the danger of any purſuer, and ſo ran acroſs over the land that night, ten or twelve miles, to give them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that lived at <hi>Sheepſcot</hi> river; it is ſaid that after ſhe got out, ſhe heard a noiſe in the houſe, as if they
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:014120_0276_0F930241DA2A7C80"/>were fighting or ſcuffling within doors; but ſhe did not count it wiſdom to go back and ſee what the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was, knowing before enough of their villanies, how well ſoever her miſtreſs (that was more verſed in the trade of the Indians) might think of them. Thoſe of <hi>Sheepſcot</hi> taking this warning, eſcaped away as ſoon as they could, leaving their cattle and dwellings as a prey to the Indians. What befel maſter <hi>Hammond</hi> and his family, is not yet certainly known: Reports paſs up and down, that ſome who came down the river after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, ſaw ſome of the dead ſtripped upon the banks of the river, which makes us fear the worſt concerning all the reſt; for certainly the whole family, 16 in number, were all at that time either killed or carried away captive, none ſave the maid aforeſaid, being known to make an eſcape, to inform their friends, like <hi>Job</hi>'s meſſengers, what befel the reſt of the family.</p>
            <p>THE Indians having in this manner ſurprized Mr. <hi>Hammand</hi>'s houſe, they paſſed down the river the ſame night, but going by another houſe, they med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled not with the people, only turned their canoes adrift, that they might not find means afterwards to eſcape themſelves, or help others ſo to do: Poſſibly their chief aim being at <hi>Arowſick</hi> houſe, they would no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="247" facs="unknown:014120_0277_0F93024248B913F8"/>iſland) hearing the buſtle that was below, betwixt the Indians and thoſe that belonged to the place, was ſtrangely ſurprized, yet himſelf with Capt. <hi>Sylvanus Davis,</hi> and two more, underſtanding that the Indians had ſeized the fort, and killed divers of the Engliſh, apprehending it bootleſs, or rather heartleſs to ſtay, as not being able to ſtand upon their guard, or make any refiſtance, made a ſhift to find a paſſage out at a back door, whereby they eſcaped to the water ſide, where they found a canoe, into which they all enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and made away toward another iſland near by: This was not done ſo ſecretly but the Indians diſcerned them before they were gone far; four of them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haſted after thoſe that had eſcaped in another canoe, and coming within ſhot, diſcharged their guns upon them, whereby ſaid <hi>Davis</hi> was badly wounded; yet making haſte, as they generally uſed to do that fly for their lives, <hi>timor addidit alas,</hi> they got a ſhore before the Indians overtook them; it is ſaid they were ſtrangely diſpirited, or elſe they might eaſily have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended themſelves againſt their purſuers: But when once mens hearts are ſunk with fear and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon a ſudden ſurprizal, it is hard to buoy them up, to make any competent reſiſtance. Capt. <hi>Davis</hi> being badly wounded, could neither truſt to his legs to fly, nor yet make uſe of his hands to fight, yet was ſtrangely preſerved; Providence directing him to go into the cleft of a rock, ear by the place where he firſt landed; the Indians by the glittering of the fun beams in their eyes as they came aſhore, did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern him; ſo that lying hid under the covert of the hand of Providence for two days, he at laſt crawled a little above the water ſide, till he found a canoe, whereby he eſcaped with his life. The other two were better foot men, and parting with Capt. <hi>Lake,</hi> made their eſcape ten or twelve miles, to the farther end of the iſland, and ſo eſcaped from the Indians, till they found means to get off Poor Capt. <hi>Lake,</hi> who a few hours before ſlept quietly in his manſion houſe, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with a ſtrong fortification, defended with many ſoldiers, is now forced to fly away with none to
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:014120_0278_0F930242F2AE4610"/>attend him; and as the awful hand of Providence ordered things, was as ſome ſay, purſued by ſuch Indians as were mere ſtrangers to the place, that knew not the maſter from the man, but by one of whom he was ſhot down, as is ſuppoſed ſoon after he came aſhore; Lieut. <hi>Davis</hi> heard two guns, by which it was thought, and ſoon after was known to be by an Indian, who hath ſince confeſſed to Capt. <hi>Davis</hi> that he ſhot him that day <hi>Arowſick</hi> was taken, which he intended not to have done, but that he held up his piſtol againſt him; whereas if he had but aſked quarter, he ſhould have had his life. Capt. <hi>Lake</hi> was ſlain at that time, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though many hopes were for ſome time entertained that he was taken alive, and kept with other captives amongſt the Indians; and it is ſaid the Indians of thoſe parts did not intend to kill him, if they could have helped it; but it was known his hat was ſeen upon an Indian's head not long after, which made his friends conclude what had befallen that good man, who might emphatically be ſo termed, in diſtinction from them that may truly be called juſt men, and no more: For it ſeems according to the juſt agreement betwixt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his part owner of <hi>Arowſick</hi> iſland, it was not his turn this year to have been upon the place, but ſuch was his goodneſs, that he yielded to the deſire of his friend and partner, as in his room and ſtead to take upon himſelf that ſervice in this time of danger; it is hoped his goodneſs in future time will not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by ſuch as were any way concerned therein, or had advantage thereby.</p>
            <p>THIS iſland (called <hi>Arowſick,</hi> from an Indian ſo named that formerly poſſeſſed it, and of whom it was purchaſed by one Mr. <hi>Richards,</hi> who ſold it to Capt. <hi>Lake</hi> and Major <hi>Clarke</hi>) lies up ten miles within the mouth of <hi>Kennebeck</hi> river; it is ſome miles in length, and contains many thouſand acres of very good land; where meadow and arable ground are in a good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion well ſuited together. Within the fort aforeſaid, were many convenient buildings for ſeveral officers, as well for wares and trading, as habitation: Six ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:014120_0279_0F930243B9F2BF50"/>edifices are ſaid to have been there erected. The warehouſe at that time was well furniſhed with all ſorts of goods; beſides a mill and other accommodations and dwellings, within a mile of the fort and manſion houſe; ſome inhabitants of which hardly made their eſcape upon the firſt ſurprizal of the fort.</p>
            <p>ALL which conſidered, the loſs that befel the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors at the ſurprizal of this iſland, ſeems to be very great, valued at many thouſands; but thoſe that were the owners, with others of late times, have found from their own experience, what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaid of old, <hi>there is a time to get, and a time to loſe, a time to keep, and a time to caſt away; a time to break down, as well as a time to build up.</hi> The perſons killed and taken at <hi>Kennebeck,</hi> both at Mr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s, and at <hi>Arowſick,</hi> are ſaid to be 53.</p>
            <p>UPON the report of this ſad diſaſter, all the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Engliſh in thoſe parts were ſoon after left, and forſaken by degrees. All the reſt of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Kennebeck</hi> river, <hi>Sheepſcot</hi> river, <hi>Sagadahock,</hi> and <hi>Damanicottee,</hi> fearing to be ſerved in the ſame kind, fled to the iſlands of <hi>Cape Bonawagan,</hi> and <hi>Damaril</hi>'s <hi>Cove.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ON the ſecond day at night a poſt was ſent to <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maquid</hi> to inform them of what had happened, who being but eight or ten men, had a mind to go on the iſland called <hi>Monbiggon,</hi> having ſecured the beſt of their goods, but the wind taking them ſhort, they were forced to turn into <hi>Damaril's Cove,</hi> where they found Mr. <hi>Wiſwall,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Colicot;</hi> there they laboured two days to ſettle a garriſon; but thro' the mutinous diſpoſition of the people, and the want of proviſion, nothing could be done to ſecure the iſland, ſo that it was ſoon deſerted. From thence they went to <hi>Monbig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> reſolving there to tarry till they heard from <hi>Boſton,</hi> from whence Mr. <hi>Colicot</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wiſwall</hi> promiſed to do their utmoſt endeavor to ſend help. There they ſettled three guards, and appointed 25 to watch every
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:014120_0280_0F9302445B3126B0"/>night, not knowing but that the Indians might come every hour. But continuing there a fortnight, and finding no relief like to come, and ſeeing all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try burnt round about, (for after they had got all that could be ſaved from <hi>Pemmaquid,</hi> they ſaw all the other iſlands, <hi>Windgin</hi>'s, <hi>Corbin</hi>'s <hi>Sound, New-Harbour,</hi> and <hi>Pemmaquid,</hi> all on fire in two hours time) then conſidering what was beſt to be done, they found no boats could be ſent to ſea for fear of weakening the iſland, and that moſt of thoſe who were on it were ſtrangers, coaſters, and ſuch as came from the main, and ready to be gone upon every occaſion, they laid an embargo for one week; after which a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was received from Major <hi>Clarke,</hi> deſiring their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance for enquiring after Capt. <hi>Lake,</hi> if alive, ſaying, what could be had at <hi>Kennebeck,</hi> &amp;c. but intimating nothing of any help like to come; beſides, thoſe that brought the letter told them it was in vain to expect any help from <hi>Boſton,</hi> it being queſtioned there what they had to do with thoſe parts. Upon which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants conſidered, that if they ſhould tarry there and ſpend all their proviſion, and neither be able to go to ſea, nor yet to live, or be ſafe aſhore for want of help, it were better for them to remove while they had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to live upon, and ſeek employment elſewhere; ſo by conſent they reſolved forthwith to tranſport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and what they had ſaved of their goods, to ſome place of ſecurity, ſo they ſailed the firſt opportunity, ſome for <hi>Piſcataqua,</hi> ſome for <hi>Boſton,</hi> and ſome for <hi>Salem,</hi> at one of which places they all ſafely arrived.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus eſcaped at firſt, as <hi>Lot</hi> out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> but not counting themſelves ſafe in that <hi>Zoar,</hi> where for a little while they made out to hide their heads, till they might eſcape to ſome ſurer place, there wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for better times, when they may with peace and quietneſs return to their former habitations, or ſeek ſome other elſewhere.</p>
            <p>WHEN the aforeſaid exploits were done by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians about <hi>Caſco-Bay,</hi> ſeveral of the Engliſh removed
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:014120_0281_0F9302451CB26F80"/>to <hi>Jewel</hi>'s iſland, where they hoped to be more ſecure from the Indians, but the barbarous enemy finding ſo little reſiſtance made againſt them on the main land, a conſiderable party of them came with their canoes to deſtroy that iſland alſo, about three weeks after the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forementioned miſchiefs.</p>
            <p>THERE was a fortified houſe upon the ſaid iſland, where the Engliſh that either kept upon the iſland, or repaired thither, hoped to ſecure themſelves. But at the time the Indians aſſaulted the place, many of the Engliſh were abſent, and few left in the garriſon but women and children. Some were gone to other places to fetch Indian corn, others were in a boat employed about fiſh, amongſt whom was one <hi>Richard Pots</hi> with two more. The wife of the ſaid <hi>Pots</hi> was waſhing by the water ſide, where ſhe was ſurprized with her child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, and carried away in fight of her huſband, who was not a little diſtreſſed with that ſad ſpectacle, but was incapable of affording any relief either to his wife or children. One of theſe little innocents, eſpying his father in the boat, ran into the water, calling out for help; but an Indian was running after him to catch him up; the poor man in a great agony, being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in half a gun ſhot, was about to fire upon the Indian, but fearing he might wound or perhaps kill his child, which the villian had ſeized and was carrying off, he forbore, chuſing rather to have him carried away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, than expoſe him to the loſs of his life or limbs, by ſhooting at the Indian.</p>
            <p>IT is ſaid ſome of the Indians were killed by thoſe in the garriſon; 'tis mentioned that a lad at one ſhot killed two or three of them; ſome guns were found afterwards under the fort, which were ſuppoſed to have belonged to ſome of the Indians that were killed. Some that were abroad when the fort was aſſaulted, deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately broke in through the Indians, whereby at the laſt many people were preſerved. Some flying away to <hi>Jewel</hi>'s iſland in a cance, to ward <hi>Richmond</hi>'s iſland, met with a ketch, to which they made known the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:014120_0282_0F930246100CDF18"/>the people were in, who thereupon went to the place and took in all the people they found there, and carried them off to a place of more ſafety. Yet there were ſeveral perſons ſaid to be killed and carried away at that time, viz. three men, who were known to be killed, two women and two children, that are ſuppoſed to be yet alive, though in the enemy's power.</p>
            <p>FROM thence they went to <hi>Spurwinks,</hi> where they aſſaulted one place, or more, and killed one man, wounded another, and carried another away captive. Amongſt thoſe that were in danger of ſurprizal, one that could not run hid himſelf in a garden of cabbages, ſo that he was not found, yet was very near them, for he overheard ſeveral queſtions they aſked him they took; by which means he was the better enabled af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward to prevent the danger two more were coming into, for the poor fellow they had taken, told them that one <hi>Gendal,</hi> and another man were to come that way by and by; whereupon this man that had hid himſelf, meeting <hi>Gendal</hi> and the other man, gave them notice of the danger, whereby they were delivered out of the ſnare for that time. Not long after Mr. <hi>Gendal</hi> fell into their hands, as ſhall hereafter be related. Within a while after, or about the ſame time, another fatal accident befel ſix or ſeven perſons belonging to <hi>Caſco:</hi> For, upon the 23d of <hi>September,</hi> ſome perſons that belonged to a ſloop and a ſhallop, that were preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into the ſervice (one reaſon of which was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their ſtragling, they being perſons that belonged to thoſe parts about <hi>Caſco</hi>) were over deſirous to ſave ſome of their proviſion, to which end they firſt made their addreſs to Capt. <hi>Hathorne,</hi> (under whom they were ordered to ſerve) deſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing they might be releaſed; the Captain told them he could not do it, but deſired them to have patience for a while; they told him they muſt and would go, elſe their families muſt ſtarve at home; the Captain told them further of the danger, and bid them not ſtir at their peril. However go they would, and ſoon after went to <hi>Mountjoy</hi>'s iſland to fetch ſheep, where they landed ſeven men; but the Indians
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:014120_0283_0F9302490514C418"/>ſuddenly fell upon them, when they betook themſelves to the ruins of a ſtone houſe, where they defended themſelves as long as they could; but at laſt they were all deſtroyed either with ſtones caſt in upon them, or with the enemies ſhot, except one, who, though at the firſt it was hoped his wounds were not mortal, yet ſoon after died thereof. Amongſt theſe was one <hi>George Felt,</hi> much lamented, who had been more active than any man in thoſe parts againſt the Indians, but at laſt he loſt his own life amongſt them, in this too deſperate an adventure.</p>
            <p>THE Indians growing more bold by theſe attempts in thoſe remote places, drew down nearer towards <hi>Piſcataqua,</hi> for not long after a party of them came upon <hi>Cape Nidduck,</hi> where they killed and carried away all the inhabitants of a few ſcattering houſes, to the number of ſeven in all; and ſuch was their ſavage cruelty exerciſed in this place, as is not uſually to be heard of, for having daſhed out the brains of a poor woman that gave ſuck, they nailed the young child to the dead body of its mother, which was found ſucking in that awful manner, when the people came to the place. The day before a man and his wife were kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them at <hi>Wells,</hi> and two more ſoon after. On the 12th of <hi>October</hi> following, near an 100 of the Indians made an aſſault upon <hi>Block-Point,</hi> all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants being gathered into one fortified place upon that point, which a few hands might have defended againſt all the Indians on that ſide of the country; but as it ſeems, one called <hi>Mugg,</hi> was the leader of the Indians, one that had from a child been well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Engliſh, and had lived ſome years in Engliſh families, who though a cunning fellow, and had ſucceeded much in his attempts, yet at this time ſhewed more courteſy to the Engliſh, than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to former outrages could be expected from any of thoſe barbarous miſcreants, and was willing to make offer of a treaty to Mr. <hi>Joſſelin,</hi> Chief of the garriſon, to whom the ſaid <hi>Mugg</hi> promiſed liberty for all that
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:014120_0284_0F930249FB1ABCC0"/>were there, to depart with their goods upon the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of the place: The ſaid <hi>Joſſelin</hi> reports, that when he came back from his treating with <hi>Mugg,</hi> that all the people were ſled away out of the garriſon, having carried away their goods by water before his return, inſomuch that having none but his houſehold ſervants to ſtand by him, he was capable of making no reſiſtance, and ſo ſurrendered.</p>
            <p>WHEN people have once been frighted with reports and ſenſe of danger, they are ready to fly away like a hart before the hunter or his hounds; one of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the place affirmed he ſaw an 150 Indians, which was more by an 100 than any body elſe ever ſaw near the fort. But when a place is conſigned to ruin, every thing they take in hand ſhall tend that way.</p>
            <p>THE loſs of <hi>Black Point</hi> was accompanied with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſad accident that happened about the ſame time at <hi>Richmond</hi>'s iſland: For young Mr. <hi>Fryer,</hi> with ſome others at <hi>Piſcataqua,</hi> to whom it ſeemed grievous that the Indians ſhould make all that ſpoil in every place in thoſe farther plantations, ventured upon the great importunity of Mr. <hi>Gendal,</hi> with a ketch, to try what they could ſave of ſuch things as the Indians had left; but things were ſo ordered, that before they had loaded their ketch, coming too near the ſtage head, they preſently found themſelves in danger of a ſorprizal; for part of their company being aſhore, were ſeized by the Indians, or in danger thereof, whom they were not willing to leave behind; and beſides the wind blowing in hard upon them, they could not get out of the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, but were forced to abide the danger of an aſſault; the Indians getting many of them into the ſtage head, annoyed them ſo faſt with their ſhot, that not a man of them was able to look above deck, but he was in danger of being ſhot down; amongſt the reſt Mr. <hi>James Fryer</hi> venturing too much in view of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, received a wound in his knee, which appeared not dangerous at firſt, but for want of bover looking to, than could be found amongſt that black regiment, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:014120_0285_0F93024A5DA17EB8"/>whoſe hands he ſoon after fell, it proved mortal unto him within a ſew days after; he being by a ſtrange accident brought home to his father's houſe, at the great iſland in <hi>Piſcataqua</hi> Mr. <hi>Fryer</hi> being thus wounded, the reſt of the company defended themſelves for a while, with much courage and reſolution, till they were brought to the ſad choice of falling into the hands of one of theſe three bad maſters, the fire, the water, or the barbarous heathen, to whom at laſt they thought it beſt to yield, in hopes of liberty afterwards, at leaſt of lengthening out their lives a little longer, for the Indians had manned out a canoe with ſeveral hands to cut their cable, and others ſtood ready within the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the ſtage head, to fire upon any one that ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ketch, by which means the veſſel after the cable was cut, ſoon drove aſhore; and then it was threatened to be preſently burnt, if they did not all yield, to which they all at laſt conſented.</p>
            <p>THE Indians how barbarous ſoever in their own nature, yet civilly treated their priſoners, and upon farther diſcourſe ſent one or two of them to <hi>Piſcataqua,</hi> to give them there an opportunity to ranſom their friends. The perſons ſent home to procure a ranſom, were to return with ſuch a quantity of goods as the Indians had deſired, by ſuch a preciſe time; but they that brought the things for their ranſom, coming a day or two before the time, when thoſe that ſent them were gone up the river at <hi>Black-Point,</hi> and not return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Some other Indians waiting for ſuch an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, ſeized the goods, at leaſt that part which they moſt deſired, and through miſtake, killing one of the three men that brought them, diſmiſſed the other two, without return of the priſoners as was expected.</p>
            <p>AS to what happened afterwards, we are yet much in the dark, and for the preſent can write but by gueſs: For within a few days after the return of Mr. <hi>Gendal,</hi> and the other man that went to carry the ranſom, before the 1ſt of <hi>November, Mugg</hi> himſelf came to <hi>Piſcataqua,</hi> bringing Mr. <hi>James Fryer,</hi> who ſoon after
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:014120_0286_0F93024B37982998"/>died of his wound; one of the priſoners along with him complaining that without his knowledge ſome of the Indians had ſeized what was ſent for the ranſom of the reſt, promiſing upon his faith, that he would make good his word for the ſending home all the priſoners, and offered alſo in the name of the other Indians to confirm a new peace with the Engliſh for the future. The Major General of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> colony was then at <hi>Piſcataqua,</hi> but not willing to tranſact a matter of that nature and moment by his ſole authority, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the ſaid <hi>Mugg</hi> (ſuppoſed to be the chief leader of the Indians) to be carried down to <hi>Boſton,</hi> to the Governor and Council there, to conclude the buſineſs, with whom he ſoon after agreed upon a firm peace with the Engliſh of the <hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> in the name of <hi>Madockawando,</hi> the Chief of all the Indians in the eaſtern parts about <hi>Penobſcot,</hi> engaging alſo to remain himſelf as hoſtage, aboard the veſſel (in which he was ſent home from <hi>Boſton,</hi> the 21ſt of <hi>November</hi> following) until the priſoners (which are ſaid to be 50 or 60, that they have ſtill in their hands) be ſent home, and the reſt of the articles performed; the iſſue of which we as yet wait to hear in God's good time, this 12th day of <hi>December</hi> following, 1676, when they there have made an end of the reckoning, it is hoped we may have our right again.</p>
            <p>THERE are two principal actors amongſt the Indians that have all along promoted theſe deſigns amongſt them, one named <hi>Squando,</hi> Sagamore of <hi>Saco,</hi> and the aforementioned <hi>Madockawando,</hi> the chief commander of the Indians eaſtward about <hi>Penobſcot,</hi> who are ſaid to be, by them that know them, a ſtrange kind of moralized ſavages; grave and ſerious in their ſpeech and carriage, and not without ſome ſhew of a kind of religion, which no doubt but they have learned from the Prince of Darkneſs (by the help of ſome Papiſt in thoſe parts) that can <hi>transform himſelf into an Angel of light;</hi> under that ſhape, the better to carry on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of his kingdom. It is ſaid alſo, they pretend to have received ſome viſions and revelations, by which
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:014120_0287_0F93024C0D41B8F8"/>they have been commanded to worſhip the great God, and not to work on the Lord's day. We know where that fountain hath its riſe, that ſendeth forth at the ſame place ſweet and bitter waters; and from whence their hearts are inſpired, that join bleſſing of God, with curſing and killing his ſervants.</p>
            <p>IT is reported by ſome that came lately from thoſe parts, that the Indians there do as yet refuſe to have any peace with the Engliſh, and will not as yet return any of our captive friends, till God ſpeak to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid enthuſiaſts, that are their leaders, that they ſhould no longer make war with us, and the like.</p>
            <p>BUT not to trouble ourſelves farther with thoſe miniſters of Satan, or thoſe that are actuated by the Angel of the bottomleſs pit, who poſſibly ſince their deluſions are but two ſold more the children of Hell than they were before. We know better how to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the mind of the great Lord of Heaven and Earth, than to depend on ſuch lying oracles.</p>
            <p>THAT God who hath at preſent turned their hearts to hate his people, and deal ſubtilly with his ſervants, we hope in time, will either turn the ſtream, and cauſe them to deal friendly and ſincerely with his people as heretofore, or give us an opportunity to deſtroy them.</p>
            <p>IN the next place it remains, that ſome account be given of our forces under Capt. <hi>Hathorne,</hi> and of their ſeveral expeditions into the eaſtern parts, ſince the middle of <hi>September</hi> laſt; firſt up toward <hi>Caſco,</hi> by the ſea-ſide, then afterwards through the woods, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly northward, toward <hi>Oſſapy</hi> and <hi>Pigwauchet,</hi> in hopes to have found the enemy there at their head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarters.</p>
            <p>UPON the firſt report of thoſe devaſtations and ſpoils that had been made by fire and ſword in thoſe eaſtern plantations, it was judged neceſſary to ſend ſome forces that way to put a ſtop to the current of
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:014120_0288_0F93024CC35C7558"/>thoſe outrages, before the remainder of the ſouthern Indians could have an opportunity to join with them: To that end about an 130 Engliſh, with 40 Indians, were diſpatched away into thoſe parts, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Capt. <hi>William Hathorne,</hi> Capt. <hi>Sill.</hi> and Capt. <hi>Hunting,</hi> who were to join with ſuch as could be raiſed in thoſe parts, under Major <hi>Waldern</hi> and Capt. <hi>Froſt.</hi> After they had ſurprized the Indians that flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into thoſe parts, (as was related before) which was done upon the 6th of <hi>September,</hi> 1676, Capt. <hi>Hath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne,</hi> who was commander in chief, marched the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by the ſea-ſide, towards <hi>Caſco;</hi> For at that time they were upon ſome demure, whether to march di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſectly toward <hi>Oſſapy</hi> and <hi>Pigwauchet,</hi> where the head-quarters of the enemy was ſuppoſed to be, or elſe to march directly toward <hi>Caſco Bay,</hi> where they heard parties of he enemy were daily ſpoiling the plantations of the Engliſh; at the laſt it was judged moſt expedient to try if they could not meet with ſome parties of the enemy amongſt thoſe plantations near the ſea ſide, by that means at leaſt to prevent them from doing more miſchief, if they could not find an opportunity to fall upon ſome of them and deſtroy them; but their time was not yet come, nor were all the deſolations as yet accompliſhed, which God had a purpoſe to bring about by their means: For notwithſtanding there was a ſufficient force to have ſuppreſſed all the numbers of the enemy, if they had been many more than they were, yet being emboldened and grown ſubtle by their former ſucceſſes, they had ſo diſperſed themſelves all about the woods in thoſe parts, that when our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were in one place, they would be in another, and ſo did much miſchief thereabouts, while our ſoldiers were out after them: For after they had by ſeveral ſtops in ten days time got to <hi>Caſco</hi> from <hi>Newechewannick</hi> (about the 8th of <hi>September</hi>) they marched to <hi>Wells,</hi> and from <hi>Wells</hi> to <hi>Winter Harbour,</hi> and ſo from whence to <hi>Black-Point</hi> they paſſed by water, and then arrived at <hi>Caſco Bay,</hi> about the 20th of <hi>September;</hi>

               </gap>et about that very time were ſeveral of the Engliſh cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> off at <hi>Mountjoy</hi>'s iſland, and that in ſight of our forces, when
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:014120_0289_0F93024D860628F8"/>they were not able to come at them for want of boats, the iſland lying two leagues off in the bay; this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the 23d of the ſame month, as was ſaid before; and within two days after, another party of the enemy were doing miſchief at <hi>Wells</hi> and <hi>Cape-Nidduck,</hi> and yet eſcaped away when they had done.</p>
            <p>NOR could our forces in all their expedition meet with any of them, but two; one of which ſoon after he was taken, was let go by the treachery or careleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them that held him. For when our forces were come within a few miles of the hither ſide of <hi>Caſco Bay,</hi> ſome of our <hi>Natick</hi> Indian ſcouts going in company with the Indians under <hi>Blind Will</hi> (a Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more of <hi>Piſcataqua,</hi> who went in company with 8 of his men, ſuppoſed to be good pilots for the places more eaſtward) met with ſome of the enemy, and laid hold of a couple of them; juſtice was done to one of them; the other, although he was led by two of <hi>Blind Will</hi>'s Indians, they made ſhift to let go, who eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, got over a river, and gave notice to the Indians who were on the other ſide, and were heard but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before threſhing in a barn that belonged to one <hi>Anthony Bracket,</hi> whom they had lately ſurprized, Another diſappointment our forces met with about the ſame time; for when Capt. <hi>Hathorne</hi> was up at <hi>Caſco Bay</hi> with his ſoldiers, he never could come up with the Indians, either through want of ſkill in them that were his ſcouts, or rather want of faithfulneſs in one that ſhould have been his guide, who had got his living by trading with the Indians, therefore ſeemed unwilling to have the brood of them deſtroyed, as was known after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; and by that means a party of the enemy eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped the hands of our ſoldiers. Yet it pleaſed God at one time to bring the forlorn of our forces upon a party of the enemy, who eſpying the Engliſh, preſently fled away into the woods like ſo many wild dee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; yet one of them, viz <hi>J. Sanpſon,</hi> who had been of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany that killed <hi>Robinſon</hi> the year before, was by the ſpecial hand of Divine juſtice, ſuffered to fell by ſome of our forces; he was a very luſty, ſtout man, and one
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:014120_0290_0F93024E1D4DC520"/>that was armed with ſeveral forts of weapons, but there is no weapon ſhall defend them whom death hath a commiſſion to deſtroy; there is no ranſom in that war. The reſt of the Indians that were ſcattered about <hi>Caſco Bay,</hi> having diſcovered our forces, made their eſcape; but we hope their time is ſhort, and that God will find ſome way to cut off the bloody and deceitful enemies of his people, and not ſuffer them to live out half their days.</p>
            <p>BUT by one ſuch accident or other, our ſoldiers could not meet with any of them that had done the miſchief about thoſe parts. While our forces lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Caſco-Bay,</hi> a ſmall party of the enemy came down upon the borders of the town of <hi>Wells,</hi> where they lay in ambuſh near a garriſon houſe at one end of the town, and ſhot Mr. <hi>JamesGouge</hi> from his horſe, on Lord's-day, <hi>Sept.</hi> 24th, as he was going home from the meeting, and then knocked down his wife, giving her ſeveral wounds with their hatchers about the head, or which ſhe died in three days after.</p>
            <p>THE next day, <hi>Sept.</hi> 25th, the ſame party, being not more than ſeven in number, went toward <hi>York,</hi> and ſurprized <hi>Cape-Nidduck</hi> in a moſt barbarous manner, killing moſt of the poor people belonging thereunto. Some of their neighbors hearing the guns, came to their reſcue; the Indians being on the further ſide of a river, dared them to come over and fight with them man to man, uſing many reproachful expreſſions, and making a ſhot at them, which ſome of the company not being able to bear, did very reſolutely adventure through the river after them; but they were not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to try the valour of the Engliſh, when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived they found a way to paſs over the river upon them, but returned back towards <hi>Wells,</hi> where they killed one <hi>George Farrow, Sept.</hi> 27th, as he was too careleſsly venturing to his houſe without any company. Theſe things happened while our forces were at <hi>Caſco,</hi> where they tarried ſeven or eight days; and bearing of theſe outrages committed in ſome of thoſe places
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:014120_0291_0F93024EDB40C2C8"/>which they left behind them, and not being able to meet with any of them in the place where they were, they returned back towards <hi>Wells</hi> and <hi>York;</hi> but the Indians were eſcaped away into the woods after their companions, before they came there. Our ſoldiers having thus ſpent much time and pains in a fruitleſs expedition towards <hi>Caſco,</hi> reſolved to venture another march after them up towards <hi>Oſſapy,</hi> ſuppoſing they might by that time be drawn homewards toward their winter quarters; or elſe that they might deſtroy what they had left behind them, to prevent their harbouring there for the future: But it ſeemed good to him, who by his ſovereign power and infinite wiſdom ordereth all events and purpoſes (wherein his people or others are concerned) to diſappoint all endeavors uſed at that time for the ſuppreſſing of the enemy, or putting any ſtop to their wonted ſucceſſes; for ſoon after our forces were returned back from <hi>Caſco,</hi> news was brought of the ſurprizal of <hi>Black-Point,</hi> on the 12th of <hi>October,</hi> as was mentioned before; which notwithſtanding, it was judged more adviſeable to venture and proceed on with the expedition toward <hi>Oſſapy,</hi> (whither it was ſuppoſed by this time the greateſt number of them were retired) rather than to return back again to recover <hi>Black-Point,</hi> where was nothing to be expected but an empty fort, and ſome deſerted houſes, which it ſeems the Indians had forſaken by that time. And beſides, that other forces were about the ſame time ordered to repair thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſufficient for the repairing and ſecuring the place with what elſe was left remaining from the hands of the enemy: And likewiſe ſeveral ſoldiers were ordered to garriſon the towns thereabouts, to prevent them from making any further aſſault upon them. However, they were ſo far emboldened by the taking of <hi>Black-Point,</hi> and the ketch at <hi>Richmond</hi> iſland, that a party of them came the very next week after, toward <hi>Wells,</hi> hoping to attain that, and all the towns and places between <hi>Caſco-Bay</hi> and <hi>Piſcataqua,</hi> as they had done <hi>Black-Point:</hi> For a party of them under <hi>Mugg</hi> their chief leader, brought Mr. <hi>Gendal</hi> along with them to <hi>Wells,</hi> where they ſummoned the firſt garriſon at the town's
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:014120_0292_0F930250D13BBE40"/>end. To facilitate the buſineſs, they ſent the ſaid <hi>Gendal</hi> as their agent or meſſenger to move them' ſo ſurrender without hazarding an onſet; but the people were not ſo deſpondent as to yield up the place upon ſo ſlight an occaſion; which when the enemy diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they ſoon drew off, after they had done ſome little miſchief to the inhabitants; for firſt they killed <hi>Iſaac Littlefield,</hi> not far from the garriſon; it is ſaid they would willingly have had him yield himſelf priſoner, but he refuſing, they ſhot him down, yet they were ſo civil as to ſuffer his friends to fetch away his body, without offering any further act of inhumanity to it, or hoſtility towards thoſe that carried it off.</p>
            <p>AN old man called <hi>Croſs,</hi> was likewiſe killed by them about the ſame time; and another whoſe name was <hi>Joſeph Bigford,</hi> belonging to the garriſon, was ſo badly wounded that he died very ſoon after. Thirteen head of next cattle were alſo killed by them, out of which (through haſte) they only took the tongues, leaving the bodies whole to the owners, unleſs it was the leg of one of them, which was alſo taken away.</p>
            <p>THIS was all the miſchief done by them after the taking of <hi>Black-Point.</hi> The inhabitants of <hi>Winter-Harbour,</hi> near adjoining thereto, being alarmed with the ſurprizal of the other place, fled away with their goods for a time, until they heard the enemy were moved farther eaſtward, and then it is ſaid they return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their place again. In this poſture have things remained ever ſince in thoſe eaſtera plantations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Piſcataqua</hi> and <hi>Caſco-Bay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT our forces under the command of Captain <hi>Hathorne</hi> and Capt. <hi>Sill,</hi> having at laſt obtained all things neceſſary for a winter march into the woods, did upon the firſt of <hi>November</hi> following, ſet out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Oſſapy,</hi> where, after four days march of a very difficult way, over many rivers, not eaſy to paſs at that time of the year, they arrived; but found not an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian either there, or in the way as they marched along.
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:014120_0293_0F93025128142990"/>The Indians belonging to thoſe parts had not many years before, hired ſome Engliſh traders to build them a fort for their ſecurity againſt the <hi>Mohawks,</hi> which was built very ſtrong for that purpoſe, fourteen foot high, with flankers at each corner; but at this time the ſoldiers intending to diſappoint them of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, made fuel thereof, which at that time was very needful for our people, who had marched many miles through deep ſnow in a very cold ſeaſon, when they could hardly keep themſelves from freezing as they paſſed along, ſo early in the winter. None of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy being to be found there in their ſtrongeſt fort, it was not counted worth while for all the company to march any further; wherefore a ſmall party being ſent up eighteen or twenty miles farther northward amongſt the woods, where as they paſſed along they met with many vaſt lakes, (ſuppoſed to be the cauſe of the ſharpneſs of the cold in that ſide of the country) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the place ſcarce habitable for any beſides thoſe ſavages that uſed to hunt thereabouts for mooſe in the winter, and beaver in the ſummer. But at this time it is ſuppoſed they were all gone lower toward the ſea ſide, to ſhare the ſpoils of the Engliſh plantations late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurprized by them, which is all the reward they have met with, who in former years for the ſake of a little lucre by traffic with them, have run themſelves there into the very jaws of deſtruction, either by irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular dealing with them, or by their too much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in their deceitful friendſhip.</p>
            <p>THE 9th of <hi>November,</hi> our forces having ſpent nine days in this ſervice, returned ſafe to <hi>Newechewannick,</hi> from whence they ſet forth at the firſt, having run more hazard of their limbs by the ſharpneſs of the froſt, than of their lives by any aſſault from their enemies.</p>
            <p>THERE was great probability that the deſign might have had ſome good effect if <hi>Mugg</hi> did not much abuſe thoſe he fled unto, with a proffer of peace; for he told them that there were about an hundred of them about <hi>Oſſapy</hi> not many days before. But it becomes us to
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:014120_0294_0F930251D9608948"/>look beyond ſecond cauſes in events of this nature, and conclude that God had raiſed up theſe barbarous ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to bring a like chaſtiſement upon the Engliſh in this ſide of the country, with that which others had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured elſewhere in the end of the former and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the preſent year.</p>
            <p>WHEREAS mention was formerly made of a peace concluded at <hi>Boſton,</hi> between the Governor and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts,</hi> and <hi>Mugg</hi> an eaſtward Indian, in the name of <hi>Madockawando,</hi> chief Sagamore of all the Indians about <hi>Pemmaquid</hi> and <hi>Penobſcot;</hi> which ſaid <hi>Mugg</hi> was ſent from <hi>Boſton, Nov.</hi> 21ſt, with two veſſels to receive the priſoners were detained by the Indians, and alſo to ſee the ratification of the ſeveral articles of the ſaid peace concluded upon; which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles for the better ſatisfaction of thoſe that have not been acquainted with them, are thought fit to be here inſerted, and are as follow, viz.</p>

            <p>The ſaid <hi>Mugg</hi> lifted up his hand to heaven for the true performance thereof, eſteemed amongſt them a ſtrong obligation to perform what they promiſe.</p>
            <p>THINGS were ſo ordered by the good Providence of God, that the ſaid veſſels arrived ſafely at <hi>Penobſcot</hi> in the beginning of the next month, where they ſound the ſaid <hi>Madockawando,</hi> who was ready to confirm and make good the articles of the peace concluded at <hi>Boſton</hi> by his agent in his name; and was willing alſo to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver all the priſoners that were then in his power, or under his command, which were but eleven, who were taken in the veſſel at <hi>Richmond</hi>'s iſland, the 12th of <hi>October</hi> laſt. The ſaid <hi>Mugg</hi> likewiſe being ſenſible of the obligation he lay under to make his word good, did venture to go up himſelf to another plantation of the Indians, where was ſuppoſed ſome more of the Engliſh priſoners were, to ſee whether he could obtain their releaſe, as alſo to perſuade the reſt of the Indians thereabouts to join in the confirmation of the peace: It appeared to the perſons belonging to the veſſels, that the ſaid <hi>Mugg</hi> went with ſome reluctancy, as feating the Indians he was going amongſt, would either kill him, or keep him priſoner; to which end, he order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:014120_0297_0F93025454B0D448"/>the commanders belonging to the veſſels, to tarry for him about three days, or four at the moſt, aſſuring them, that if he did not return by that time, they might certainly conclude that either his life or liberty was taken from him; however, the veſſels tarried about or near a week beyond the time limited, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of his coming; but after ſo long ſtay, they neither ſeeing nor hearing from him, were ready to fear the worſt, viz. that his countrymen had made him ſure, from having more to do with the Engliſh; whereupon for fear of being ſhut up by the ſharpneſs of the winter from returning themſelves, they rook the opportunity of the next fair wind, of ſetting ſail for <hi>Boſton</hi> (only turning into <hi>Pemmaquid,</hi> to ſee if they could hear any farther news there) where they arrived with ſuch priſoners as were freely delivered by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dockawando,</hi> the 25th of <hi>December</hi> following, anne 1676; amongſt which priſoners, beſides the two afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, who were found at <hi>Penobſcot,</hi> there was a third, by a more remarkable Providence than ordinary, added unto them, Mr. <hi>Thomas Cobbet,</hi> ſon of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend and worthy miniſter of the goſpel, Mr. <hi>Thomas Cobbet,</hi> paſtor of the church at <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> a town with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> juriſdiction, who had all the time of his ſon's captivity, together with his friends, wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with God in their daily prayers for his releaſe, and accordingly he was with the more joy received by his friends, as an anſwer and return of their prayers. The ſaid young man had lived with Mr. <hi>Fryer,</hi> mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, of <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> for ſome years before, and had been often at ſea with Mr. <hi>James Fryer,</hi> the eldeſt ſon of the ſaid merchant, and who had after much expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of his faithfulneſs, dexterity, and courage on all ſuch accounts, borne him ſo much reſpect, that when he was urged by his father to go along with Mr. <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,</hi> as was ſaid before, he would not venture unleſs his friend <hi>Thomas Cobbet,</hi> would go along with him; which ſervice he only for his friends ſake accepted, which proved a fatal adventure to Mr. <hi>James Fryer,</hi> and might have been to the other alſo, had not God otherwiſe diſpoſed of him, having, as is hoped, more
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:014120_0298_0F93025766D8BF78"/>ſervice for him in the land of the living. Amongſt all the priſoners at that time taken, the ſaid <hi>Thomas Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet</hi> ſeemed to have had the hardeſt portion; for beſide; the deſperate dangers that he eſcaped, before he was taken, firſt by a bullet ſhot through his waiſtcoat, ſecondly by a drunken Indian, who had a knife at his throat to cut it, when his hands were bound, when the Indians came to ſhare the priſoners amongſt them, he fell into the hands of one of the ruggedeſt fellow, by whom within a ſew days after his ſurprizal, he was carried firſt from <hi>Black-Point</hi> to <hi>Sheepſcot</hi> river, in the ketch, which the Indians made to fail in, in the ſaid river, from whence he was forced to travel with his Pateroon, four or five miles over land, to <hi>Damariſcottee,</hi> where he was compelled to row or paddle in a canoe, about fifty miles farther to <hi>Penobſcot,</hi> and there taking leave of all his Engliſh friends and acquaintance, at leaſt for the winter, he was put to paddle a canoe up fifty or ſixty miles farther eaſtward, to an iſland called <hi>Mount-Deſert,</hi> where his Pateroon uſed to keep his win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ion, and to appoint his hunting vovages; and in that deſert-like condition was the poor young man forced to continue nine weeks in the ſervice of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage miſcreant, who ſometimes would tyrannize over him, becauſe he could not underſtand his language, and for want thereof, might occaſion him to miſs of his game, or the like. Whatever ſickneſs he was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to, by chance of diet, or on any other account, he could expect no other allowance than the wigwam will afford: If <hi>Joſeph</hi> be in the priſon, ſo long as God is with him there, he ſhall be preſerved, and in due time remembered.</p>
            <p>AFTER the end of the nine weeks, the Indian whom he was to ſerve, had ſpent all his powder, whereupon on a ſudden he took up a reſolution to ſend this young man down to <hi>Penobſcot</hi> to Mr. <hi>Caſteen,</hi> to procure more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to kill mooſe and deer, which it ſeems is all their way of living at <hi>Mount-Deſert;</hi> the Indian was certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over-ruled by Divine Providence, in ſending his captive down thither, for a few days before, as it ſeems,
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:014120_0299_0F93025877E60348"/>after the Indians in that place had been powawing together. he told him, that there were two Engliſh veſſels then come into <hi>Pemmaquid,</hi> or <hi>Penobſcot,</hi> which indeed proved ſo; yet was it not minded by him ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when he ſent his captive thither for powder, for it proved the means of his eſcape, which his Pateroon might eaſily have conjectured, if it had not been hid from him. As ſoon as he arrived at <hi>Penobſcot,</hi> he met with <hi>Mugg,</hi> who preſently ſaluted him by the name of Mr. <hi>Cobbet,</hi> and taking him by the hand, told him he had been at his father's houſe (which was the 1ſt or 2d of <hi>November</hi> before, as he paſſed through <hi>Ipſwich</hi> to <hi>Boſton</hi>) and had promiſed to ſend him home, as ſoon as he returned. <hi>Madockawando</hi> taking notice of what <hi>Mugg</hi> was ſpeaking that way, although he was will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he ſhould be releaſed according to agreement (his Pateroon being one of this Sagamore's ſubjects, though during the hunting voyage of the winter, he lived at ſuch a diſtance from him) began to demand ſomething for ſatisfaction, in a way of ranſom, not underſtanding before that his father was a great preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as they uſe to call it: Reply was made him, that he ſhould have ſomething in lieu of a ranſom, viz. a fine coat, which they had for him on board the veſſel; which the Sagamore deſired to ſee, before he would abſolutely grant a releaſe; but upon ſight of the ſaid coat he ſeemed very well ſatisfied, and gave him free liberty to return home. Whilſt this Mr. <hi>Thomas Cobbet</hi> was a priſoner at <hi>Mount-Deſert,</hi> going along with the Indians to hunt on an extream cold day, he was ſo overcome with the ſharpneſs thereof, that all his ſenſes whore ſuddenly benummed, ſo that he fell down upon the ſnow, not being able to ſtir hand or foot, and had without doubt there periſhed in a little time, but the Indians he was going along with, miſſing him, preſently ran about the woods to ſeck him, and when they ſound him, they were either ſo pitiful to him, or ſo careful of their own good, as not to caſt away a likely young man, from whom they expected either much ſervice, or a good ranſom, for
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:014120_0300_0F930258B3914758"/>want of a little care and pains to preſerve his life; wherefore taking him upon their ſhoulders, they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him into the next wigwam, ſo that he ſoon after revived, and came to himſelf again, without any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miſchief.</p>
            <p>AT another time, the ſavage villian, whoſe priſoner he was, ſo long as he had ſtrong liquor, for five days together was ſo drunk the he was like a furious mad beaſt, ſo that none durſt come near him, his ſquaws he almoſt killed in one of thoſe drunken fits.</p>
            <p>THE ſaid <hi>Thomas</hi> was forced to get out of his fight into the woods all that night, for fear of being injured by him; where making a fire, he kept himſelf alive; the ſquaws being by God's ſpecial Providence ſo inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pity, that they came to him daily with victuals, by which means he was at that time alſo preſerved; all which put together, makes his deliverance the more remarkable, as an anſwer of prayer.</p>
            <p>AS for the reſt of the priſoners (which are ſaid to be 50 or 60) they were left with thoſe who firſt ſurprized them at <hi>Kennebeck,</hi> and <hi>Seepſcot</hi> river: The women are employed it ſeems to ſew, and make garments for them; they having plundered many Engliſh goods at <hi>Arowſick.</hi> They are ſo much elated with their late ſucceſſes, in ſpoiling ſo many Engliſh habitations, that they ſeem not very ready to hearken to terms of peace, as their Sagamore <hi>Madockawando</hi> doth deſire: Nor are the Engliſh able to come near them with any of their forces this winter ſeaſon, in regard both of the remoteneſs of the place, and ſharpneſs of the cold, which uſed to be extream in thoſe parts. How their hearts may be inclined in the following year, or what the Engliſh may be enabled to do againſt them, is known unto God only, on whom we deſire to wait for a comfortable iſſue of theſe our troubles. But until they have ſpent all the plunder that is taken, it is no doubt, but they will ſeem averſe from having peace; 20 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ers to the weſtward did, whoſe hearts were hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:014120_0301_0F9302596D6B0B70"/>againſt all proffers of that uature, till they were deſtroyed; poſſibly ſome remnants of them that eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped in thoſe other parts, are got hither amongſt theſe, and do animate them all they can to hoſtility againſt us, till they make theſe as miſerable as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſo forced at the laſt to fly their country. Many have been the troubles we have met with from theſe our barbarous neighbours round about us, but <hi>God we truſt will deliver us out of them all,</hi> as he hath promiſed to do for the righteous, who may in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt night of affliction ſay, <hi>light is ſown for them,</hi> which ſhall ſpring up in the appointed time thereof.</p>
            <p>NO farther news came to hand concerning the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh priſoners at <hi>Kennebeck,</hi> after the return of Capt. <hi>Moor</hi> from <hi>Penobſcot,</hi> till the 5th of <hi>January;</hi> when one <hi>Francis Card</hi> with another young man, formerly an inhabitant of ſome place about <hi>Kennebeck,</hi> or of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowſick</hi> (but then a priſoner with the Indians) made an eſcape from them, and got over to <hi>Caſco-Bay,</hi> and then to <hi>Black-Point,</hi> from thence he was conveyed to <hi>Piſcataqua</hi> ſoon after, and then to <hi>Boſton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE manner of his eſcape, as he reports was this: He was employed by the Indians to threſh corn at a barn a little lower in the river, than the place where the Indians commonly kept; being truſted alone, to go and come of himſelf, becauſe there was no ſuſpicion of any coming to carry him away, or ſeeming poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility to get away without being diſcovered, he found means to plot with another young man, who was ſent to look horſes; whoſe fleſh it ſeems is by thoſe wild ſavages, preferred before the beſt beef, ſo that having their choice of both, they took what they liked beſt. This being the employment of the young man, he had the better opportunity when he was in the woods to make a contrivance to get away. Thus being reſolved upon their deſign, they provided ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries accordingly, and ſent ſuch a meſſage home to their maſters, as might occaſion them not to expect them very ſoon that night. Thus reſolved, they
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:014120_0302_0F93025A201D0608"/>marched away as ſoon as they perceived the coaſt was clear; and having provided a canoe accordingly fit for the deſign, by the help of which they got over the water, by which they were to paſs, which was not frozen; and in the night time turned into a ſwamp, where they might make a fire to keep them from ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering with the cold, without being diſcerned; ſo that within two or three days they recovered the fort and garriſon at <hi>Black-Point,</hi> from whence they were ſoon conveyed to <hi>Boſton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS <hi>Francis Card</hi> made this relation of matters when he came to <hi>Boſton,</hi> viz. that the priſoners which he left behind were well, and not much ill uſed, only put to do the ſervile work about the Indians. Woe muſt it needs be with chriſtians, when put not only to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ, but to ſerve in thoſe tents of <hi>Kedar.</hi> Such of the women as were ſkilled in knitting and ſewing, were improved to make ſtockings and garments for their Pateroons: So it ſeems the ware-houſe at <hi>Arow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick</hi> furniſhed them with cloth, ſtuff, and linnen, and the inhabitants ſerved for artificers to cut it out, and make it up.</p>
            <p>HE reported alſo that the Indians ſpake nothing of any peace; but rather being heightened with their late and great ſucceſſes, were contriving how to get poſſeſſion of the other places in the hands of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh on that ſide of the country, which God forbid ſhould ever come to paſs; but finding ſo eaſy work of their former exploits, they hope to accompliſh their purpoſes with the like facility in all other places where they come.</p>
            <p>IT ſeems <hi>Squando</hi> is their chief leader, that enthuſiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, or rather diabolical miſcreant; who hath put on a garb of religion, and orders his people to do the like; performing religious worſhip amongſt the Indians <hi>in his way,</hi> yet is ſuppoſed to have very familiar converſe with the devil, that appears to him as an Angel of light in ſome ſhape or other very frequently. This
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:014120_0303_0F93025AD9AC4018"/>
               <hi>Francis Card</hi> alſo affirmeth, that there is not ſo great a number of the Indians as is here reported; for he faith, when they were going out upon ſome deſign, while he was in their hands, he had an opportunity to count them all, and could find but 98 of them that were men; neither could he diſcern that there were any of the weſtern Indians, unleſs <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Andrew,</hi> that formerly eſcaped out of <hi>Dover</hi> priſon; although it was before apprehended there were multitudes of them ſtocked thither.</p>
            <p>Francis Card's <hi>declaration of their beginning, Auguſt</hi> 14th.</p>
            <p>THE Indians came to <hi>Richard Hammond</hi>'s, and there killed <hi>Richard Hammond, Samuel Smith, Joſhua Grant,</hi> there parting their company, eleven men came up <hi>Kennebeck</hi> river to my houſe, and there took me, and my family. Therefore the reſt of their company went to <hi>Arowſick,</hi> and there took the garriſon: About a fortnight after they came down <hi>Kennebeck</hi> river, and ſo went down to <hi>Damaril</hi>'s <hi>Cove,</hi> and there burnt houſes, and killed cattle; then coming back parted their company; one party went to <hi>Jewel</hi>'s iſland, and the other party went to <hi>Sagadahock,</hi> being in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 81. Thoſe that went to <hi>Sagadahock</hi> took a ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop; from thence came to <hi>Kennebeck</hi> river, and then went to killing and deſtroying of cattle and houſes; for they had intelligence of a ketch and a ſhallop at <hi>Damaril</hi>'s <hi>Cove,</hi> and going there they took the ſhallop, and killed two men, being in number about 80. The next day made up their forces, went out to <hi>Black-Point,</hi> being about an 100 fighting men, and are now in two forts about 60 at a place, with ſix or eight wigwams between the two forts.</p>
            <p>NOW the beſt place to land men is in <hi>Caſco-Bay,</hi> and in <hi>Kennebeck</hi> river; the one place being eight, the other about fourteen miles from the fort where I was kept; and if the army do not go now with ſpeed, they will be gone forty miles farther up in the country. At the firſt taking of me they carried me up to <hi>Taconet,</hi>
               <pb n="274" facs="unknown:014120_0304_0F93025B9B5BF7A0"/>and the men coming down, they brought me and two more men down for fear of our killing their women and children; for they kept their women and children at <hi>Taconet</hi> all the ſummer. As ſoon as the warm wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth ſet in, they do intend to go away to <hi>Taconet,</hi> and there to build two forts, for there is their fiſhing places, and planting ground. <hi>Squando</hi> doth inform them that God doth ſpeak to him, and doth tell him that God hath left our nation to them to deſtroy, and the Indians take for truth all that he tells them; becauſe they have met with no affront. Now <hi>Mugg</hi> the rogue, being come again to the fort, doth make his brags and laughs at the Engliſh, and faith, that he hath found the way to burn <hi>Boſton,</hi> and doth make laughter at your kind entertainment; they make their brags how they do intend to take veſſels, and to go to all the fiſhing iſlands, and ſo to drive all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try before them; reckoning to be a great number in the ſpring. There is a great many Indians at <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada</hi> that have not been out this ſummer, both of <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebeck</hi> and <hi>Damaraſcoggin,</hi> therefore a great many of theſe Indians at <hi>Kennebeck</hi> do intend to go to <hi>Canada</hi> in the ſpring to them. And they do give gifts both of captives, and of goods to the eaſtern Indians, to have them to go out with them; but as yet I do not know what they will do, for <hi>Madockawando</hi> and <hi>Squando</hi> are of ſeveral judgments, and ſo have parted, and <hi>Madockawando</hi> doth pretend love to the Engliſh; they do uſe our Engliſh captives as civilly as we can expect by ſuch a people. That this is truth, is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by me, <hi>Francis Card,</hi> the 22d of <hi>January,</hi> 1676.</p>
            <p>BY the report which he brings it doth not appear ſo difficult a matter to make an attempt to recover the place, and deſtroy them that hold it, as was before apprehended: Inſomuch as that deſign, that was under debate before the Governor and Council a little before, and was let fall for the preſent, as a matter not feaſible, hath ſince been ſet a foot with a freſh reſolution: And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing alſo occurred about the ſame time, which put new life into the ſaid deſign, viz. an apprehenſion
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:014120_0305_0F93025C68EB7AA8"/>that there were ſeveral of the <hi>Narrhaganſets</hi> ſcattered about in theſe woods near <hi>Piſcataqua,</hi> who it was fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed might join with thoſe of <hi>Kennebeck</hi> in the ſpring, and ſo come down upon the Engliſh plantations, and ſpoil them all that are thereabouts. For ſoon after <hi>Francis Card</hi> came to <hi>Boſton,</hi> ſome of Major <hi>Waldern</hi>'s Indians at <hi>Quechecho,</hi> as they were hunting in the woods chanced to meet with three ſtrange Indians, two of which had guns; but thoſe of <hi>Quechecho</hi> were without. The other Indians began to inſinuate into them, to ſee if they could make way for their acceptance with the Engliſh: Thoſe Indians that this motion was made unto, in a moſt perfidious manner gave them encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement in the buſineſs, and appointed a place where to meet them the next day, ſaying they would not have them now go home with them to their wigwams, leſt their women and children ſhould be frighted with the ſight of their guns; all which was ſpoken upon a treacherous account, by that means to betray them, for they had neither women nor children at their wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wams; but not having guns themſelves, as the others had, they durſt not then ſeize upon them. The next day therefore, according to appointment, their gueſts expecting a treaty, and a friendly compliance (yet coming apart, as was ordered the day before to be the more eaſily ſurprized) arrived at the place appointed; and there preſently the firſt, being thus treacherouſly brought into the ſnare, was diſpatched out of hand. The like was alſo done to the ſecond. The third was not at ſuch a diſtance, but he either diſcerned or ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected what became of his fellows, and therefore made the more haſte to eſcape; but his deceitful friends were two quick for him, who ſhot him down before he could get out of their reach; ſo that they took him alive, as is ſaid; but he could not live much longer by reaſon of his wounds. Theſe <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>checho</hi> Indians cut off the ſcalps of their poor country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (which is their uſual manner, when it is too far to carry their heads) which being brought to Major <hi>Waldern</hi>'s Indians, they were preſently diſcerned to be <hi>Narrhaganſets</hi> by the cut of their hair. This inſtance
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:014120_0306_0F93025D18232F18"/>is a ſufficient evidence of the ſubtility, guile, and falſhood, natural to all theſe Indians, and may ſatisfy any rational perſon, what little truſt there is to be put in their words, promiſes, or engagements, though never ſo ſolemnly made, farther than they that make them, ſee advantage in the keeping and performing, Subtility, malice, and revenge, ſeems to be as inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from them, as if it were a part of their eſſence.</p>
            <p>WHATEVER hopes may be of their converſion to chriſtianity in after time, there is but little appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of any truth in their hearts at preſent, where ſo much of the contrary is ſo ordinarily breathed out of their mouths.</p>
            <p>THESE were the manners of the Gentiles in former times, while they remained children of diſobedience, until they were renewed after another image: Nor are theſe uncapable ſubjects for divine grace to work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet are there ſome natural vices proper to every nation in the world, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of the Grecians, from the teſtimony of one of their own poets.</p>
            <p>BUT to return. Theſe things ſo concurring, and ſeveral gentlemen from about <hi>Piſcataqua</hi> repairing to <hi>Boſton,</hi> ſo repreſented the ſtate of things eaſtward before the Governor and Council, that it was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended not only neceſſary, but feaſible alſo to ſuppreſs the aforeſaid Indians in thoſe parts: Whereupon it was forthwith concluded that an expedition ſhould be made againſt them; to which end 200 ſoldiers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of about 60 were of the <hi>Natick</hi> Indians, who had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven good proof of their valour and faithfulneſs to the Engliſh; all which were immediately diſpatched away the firſt week in <hi>February,</hi> by water, under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Major <hi>Waldern,</hi> as commander in chief; a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon well approved for his activity, as well as fidelity and courage in matters of this nature. They had to encounter with rough and contrary winds, and much cold weather the firſt week after their ſetting out; but having ſo much experience of the favor and goodneſs
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:014120_0307_0F93025DD92FC8D0"/>of Almighty GOD, who is always wont to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with his ſervants in like caſes, though he hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for a time deferred, for the trial of their faith and exerciſe of their patience, yet uſeth not to fail his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that put their truſt in him, and diligently ſeek his face; a ſolemn time being appointed for that end, to which we expect a comfortable anſwer. We that have ſent forth our friends on the public ſervice, being thus engaged to follow them with our prayers, at preſent in ſilence wait upon the Lord of Hoſts to give a bleſſing to the deſign; hoping our friends in this neceſſary, though difficult ſervice, thus called forth, have gone out with the like encouragement and reſolution that ſometimes <hi>Joab</hi> did. <hi>Let us be of good courage, and play the men for our people, and for the cauſe of our God.

            <p>UPON the 11th of <hi>February,</hi> two Indian ſquaws that had run away from Major <hi>Waldern</hi>'s in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of winter, out of diſcontent, becauſe the huſband of one of them, and ſome of the relations of the other were ſent away, came back with more wit than they carried away with them, though with leſs fleſh upon their backs; having wandered up toward <hi>Pigwau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet,</hi> till they were almoſt ſtarved there. they ſay ſome Indians were ſoon by them, pretending they were going to the head of <hi>Connecticut</hi> river, with hoſtile in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents againſt the Engliſh; but they going away in the manner before deſcribed, little heed is to be given ſo the ſtories they tell upon their return.</p>
            <p>THE 19th of <hi>February</hi> following, <hi>John Abbot,</hi> the maſter of Mr. <hi>Fryer</hi>'s ketch, taken <hi>October</hi> 12th, at <hi>Black-Point,</hi> came in to the <hi>Iſle of Shoales,</hi> having made a deſperate adventure to eſcape. He gave a more probable account of things in thoſe parts.</p>
            <p>HE faith they were firſt carried to <hi>Sheepſect</hi> river, where the veſſel in which they were taken was moored all the winter; in which time the Indians having ſpent
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:014120_0308_0F93025EB34E00B0"/>all their ammunition and moſt of their proviſion, tho't it high time to be looking out for more; to which end they cauſed the ſaid <hi>Abbot</hi> to fit up the veſſel (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a pinnance of about 30 tons) as well as he could, with ſuch aſſiſtance as they could afford him; and ten of them ſhipped themſelves in the ſame, intending for <hi>Penobſcot;</hi> from thence to ſail up that river as far as they could; and then leaving their veſſel to proceed on with their canoes as high up the river as the ſtream would permit, and ſo to paſs on to <hi>Canada,</hi> to buy powder of the French there; it being at this time thirty-two ſhillings a pound amongſt the Indians at <hi>Kennebeck.</hi> But as Providence ordered it, after theſe mariners launched into the deep, a ſmall ſtorm with a contrary wind began to riſe; of which the Engliſh ſkipper found ways in his ſteering to make the danger ſeem more than really it was, inſomuch that they reſolved to put in at <hi>Capebonawaggon,</hi> three leagues to the eaſtward of <hi>Seepſcot,</hi> where eight of them went aſhore, leaving two Indians on board with the Engliſh ſkipper. After he had got ſo well rid of them, he contrived how to get clear of the other alſo; therefore he perſuaded them that the veſſel would not ride ſafely in that place, ſo that he prevailed with them to let him go to another harbour, called <hi>Damaril</hi>'s <hi>Cove,</hi> two or three leagues more eaſtward. In the way as he ſailed, he ſo ordered his ſteering, that ſometimes the waves were ready to overtake the veſſel, which put his two Indians into a fright, ſo as they made all the haſte they could to get aſhore, as ſoon as they came within the harbour, urging him to go along with them; but he pretended a neceſſary excuſe to ſtay behind to look after the veſſel, but with intent, as ſoon as he ſhould ſee them aſhore, to hoiſt ſail for ſome Engliſh harbour, having no body on board with him, but a ſmall Engliſh child about three years old: It ſeems the Indians had a child or two of their own dead in the veſſel, who dying after they began their voyage, they were the forwarder to go aſhore with them, for burial: The ſaid <hi>Abbot</hi> now perceiving he had obtained his purpoſe (for he oſt reſolved on this
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:014120_0309_0F93025F66D58B28"/>project before) firſt greaſing the maſt with a piece of fat pork left by the Indians, as high as he could reach, that he with his own hands might the more eaſily hoiſt the ſail, ſo chooſing rather to caſt himſelf upon the Providence of God in the waters, than to truſt himſelf any longer with perfidious ſavages on the dry land, he came ſafe to the <hi>Iſle of Shoales</hi> before the evening of the next day, the 19th of <hi>February.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WITHIN a few days after <hi>John Abbot</hi> aforeſaid made his eſcape in the veſſel, there came an expreſs from Maj. <hi>Waldern</hi> (the commander in chief over our for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s ſent to <hi>Kennebeck</hi> to ſubdue the Indians in thoſe parts, and deliver the Engliſh captives that have been detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their hands ſince <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt) which giveth this account of their proceeding.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>February</hi> 17th. This morning the wind north-eaſt, ſoon after ſouth and ſouth-weſt, we ſet fail with our veſſels from <hi>Black-Point,</hi> for <hi>Portland,</hi> but on the eaſt ſide of <hi>Cape Elizabeth,</hi> we eſpied <hi>John Pain</hi> (who was ſent out a ſcout) who brought word the way was clear of ice and Indians; whereupon we ſteered for <hi>Mary-Point,</hi> at the head of <hi>Caſco-Bay,</hi> and got there this night, but too late to get to the fort before morning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Feb.</hi> 18th. We ſent this morning our ſcouts out by land, who returning about 8 o'clock, brought word they eſpied the tracks of three Indians, and found a birch canoe at <hi>Muckquit,</hi> about four miles off, by which we feared we were diſcovered; the companies about four o'clock were drawn forth, and juſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their march, when we eſpied five canoes of the enemy about half a mile off; they landed over againſt us on an iſland, and hallowed to us, whereby we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived they deſired a treaty; hoping to gain the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, we ſent <hi>John Pain</hi> to them, they promiſed him to bring the captives by morning, and deſired peace. After this <hi>John Pain</hi> was ſent again, and ſtayed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Indians in the room of <hi>Simon,</hi> who came to the Major. He was queſtioned, and anſwered as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="280" facs="unknown:014120_0310_0F93026017DF1D50"/>
Queſt. How came you to know we were here?</p>
            <p>Anſw. We continually kept out our ſcouts, and yeſterday our Indians left a canoe at <hi>Muckquit,</hi> which this day we miſſed, and perceived the Engliſh had taken it, and our men that left the canoe eſpied you a great way off at <hi>Portland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. Why did you break your covenant with me?</p>
            <p>Anſw. <hi>Blind Will</hi> ſtirred us up to the war here, and ſaid he would kill you at <hi>Quechecho. Simon</hi> having ſaid this, aſked the Major what his buſineſs was here, to whom it was anſwered, we came to fetch off the captives and make war as we ſee good. <hi>Simon</hi> alſo told us that the captives were all well, that we ſhould have them by morning, that <hi>Squando</hi> was there, and would give the captives to Major <hi>Waldern,</hi> that they intended peace, and had ſent to <hi>Boſton</hi> before ſlow, but that <hi>Mugg</hi> told them the Engliſh would be here ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ortly.</p>
            <p>THE Major upon this diſmiſſed <hi>Simon,</hi> and ſent for <hi>Squando,</hi> to which <hi>Squando</hi> anſwered, he would meet him half way if he would come alone in a birch canoe. To this the Major anſwered, he would not venture himſelf in one of their leaky canoes, and that if he had no more to ſay, the treaty was ended: To this <hi>Squando</hi> anſwered, he would be with us again at ten o'clock, and bring the captives.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Feb.</hi> 19th. Wind north-eaſt, the weather thick: About noon we diſcovered a party of Indians in four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen canoes about three miles above us in the bay; they landed on a point of land, and burnt one Engliſh houſe, and ſhouted to ſome of our men that were ſcouts, challenging them to fight: Immediately on the return of our ſcouts we marched againſt them as ſecretly as we could; upon ſight of us they fled; but Capt. <hi>Froſt</hi> came upon them with his whole body before they were half out of gun ſhot: In this ſkirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:014120_0311_0F930264F63B29D8"/>we judged we killed and wounded ſeveral of them without any damage, yet ſome of their bullets hit ſome of our men. For the Captain's ſake immediately after this we hung out a flag of truce, and the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my did the like. <hi>John Pain</hi> was ſent to them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the reaſon why they fired the houſe, and broke their promiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Simon</hi> met him half way, and anſwered, the houſe was fired accidentally without order from <hi>Squando;</hi> that they had ſent for the captives who were a great way off, and the foul weather hindred their coming: He queſtioned <hi>John Pain</hi> alſo why we fought them while we were in treaty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pain</hi> anſwered, they broke it themſelves in not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming their promiſe, challenging our ſoldiers to ſight; the latter <hi>Simon</hi> denied, and anſwered the other as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: <hi>Simon</hi> told him they had two men wounded, and expected ſatisfaction, but alſo promiſed the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives the next day, and ſo leſt us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Feb.</hi> 20th. The wind north-eaſt, and ſnow, it was reſolved to fail for <hi>Kennebeck</hi> the firſt fair wind, whither we had immediately gone upon our knowledge that we were diſcovered by the enemy, but that the wind and weather hindered us hitherto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Feb.</hi> 21ſt. This morning the wind north-weſt, we ſet ſail for <hi>Kennebeck,</hi> and arrived at the harbour's mouth at four o'clock. About ſun ſet we ſet ſail up the river, and got to the lower end of <hi>Arowſick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Feb.</hi> 22d. We ſet ſail this morning, but could not get to the head of the river for ice, whereupon we land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our ſoldiers at two o'clock, about twelve miles off <hi>Abound<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſit</hi> fort, and immediately began our march; at 8 o'clock at night, came to the fort; we found no Indians, there we took up our quarters this night.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="282" facs="unknown:014120_0312_0F930265E2DF1BD8"/>
               <hi>Feb.</hi> 23d. We ſent out ſcouts to diſcover the march of the enemy, but found ſo many tracks every way, that we knew not what way to follow them. At a council of war it was reſolved that Major <hi>Waldern</hi> ſhould ſail for <hi>Penobſcot,</hi> with two of the ketches, and part of the ſoldiers to ſeek after the captives, and fight the enemy if he had opportunity; the reſt to build a garriſon. In the abſence of our forces, the veſſels eſpied ſeveral fires below the river, and one Engliſh houſe was burnt; about ſun-ſet the ſoldiers returned to the veſſels.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Feb.</hi> 24th. This morning the Major with two boats and a ſhallop went to ſpy out a place to ſettle a garriſon, and found one againſt the lower end of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowſick</hi> iſland, and the veſſels are brought to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Feb.</hi> 25th. We reſted here this ſabbath.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Baker's</hi> houſe oppoſite the lower end of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowſick,</hi> being judged the moſt convenient place for their purpoſe, as well for the conveniency of water for the ſoldiers, as for a cove wherein ſhips might ride, within command thereof, their veſſels therefore were immediately anchored there, where they reſted on the Lord's day, <hi>February</hi> 25th.</p>
            <p>NEXT day, according to the advice of the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Major <hi>Waldern</hi> embarked 60 men in two veſſels, with which he ſet ſail immediately for <hi>Penobſcot,</hi> leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reſt to be employed in making preparation for ſettling a garriſon in the ſaid place.</p>
            <p>IN their way off from <hi>Gyobſcut-Point,</hi> they eſpied two Indians in a canoe, that waved their caps, as if they deſired to ſpeak with them. <hi>John Pain</hi> and <hi>Walter Gendal</hi> were preſently ſent; they gave them intelligence that many Indians were at <hi>Pemmaquid</hi> with Engliſh captives, upon which they bent their courſe thither; where arriving, they anchored at four o'clock the ſame day; ſoon after two Indians hollowe
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:014120_0313_0F9302661E4EE558"/>to them from Mr. <hi>Gardner</hi>'s fort. <hi>John Pain</hi> was ſent aſhore to enquire who they were, and what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the captives. Sundry ſorts of Indians were found upon the place, with ſeveral Sagamores, the chief of whom, was <hi>Mattahando,</hi> who told them he was glad to ſee Engliſh men there, and that he deſired peace, and promiſed to deliver ſuch captives as were at <hi>Penobſcot,</hi> the next morning; adding alſo, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſpeak with Capt. <hi>Davis.</hi> After <hi>John Pain</hi> returned to the Major, he was ſent back with the ſaid <hi>Davis,</hi> and ſtayed aſhore till three Sagamores went on board, and ſignified as much to Major <hi>Waldern,</hi> as they had ſaid before to <hi>John Pain.</hi> While they were in diſcourſe, an Engliſh captive was eſpied in a canoe with his Pateroon, with whom they deſired to ſpeak, but it was not granted at that time, he being carried farther up the river out of ſight.</p>
            <p>SOON after the Major went on ſhore with ſix men, yet carrying no arms with them. He found their words ſmoother than oyl, yet were there drawn ſwords in their hearts, of which ſome of their actions gave no ſmall ground of ſuſpicion; for they deferred all till the next morning; nor were they willing to let the man that was eſpied before in the canoe come on board to ſee his friends without leaving an hoſtage in his room, of which the Major was very glad, that he might have an opportunity of a little diſcourſe with one whom they might truſt. When they returned from the ſhore, a ſign was promiſed to be given for the appearance of the Indians by the firing of three guns.</p>
            <p>THE next morning, <hi>February</hi> 27th, the Major with the ſame number as before, went to treat with them, they, with <hi>John Pain,</hi> firſt hallowing to them: Upon their coming on ſhore their perſons were ſearched on both ſides, and all arms laid aſide. The whole fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon was ſpent in a treaty, whereat they ſeemed much to rejoice in expectation of a peace with the Engliſh; yet when Major <hi>Waldern</hi> deſired a preſent delivery of captives, with aſſiſtance of men and canoes to fight the
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:014120_0314_0F930266E883A0B8"/>
               <hi>Monoſcoggin</hi> Indians, enemies to them both, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, though they could not have had a better teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their fidelity.</p>
            <p>THEY alledged that the captives were given them by the <hi>Kennebeck</hi> Indians, and they muſt have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for keeping them all winter, and therefore were not willing to let them go without a ranſom; and as for their canoes, they ſaid they had them in preſent ſervice, being then bound for <hi>Penobſcot.</hi> The price demanded, twelve ſkins a perſon, was yielded to; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they delivered <hi>William Chadburn, John Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick,</hi> and <hi>John Worwood,</hi> which were all that they would own, or could be proved they had.</p>
            <p>THAT part of the pay which was to be in liquor, was preſently laid down, the reſt was promiſed to be fent in the afternoon. The commanders debated what was farther to be done; one or two of the old <hi>Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores</hi> (who were believed) ſeemed ſincere about the peace, profeſſed that none of them had any hand in the war, but only ſome of their young men, whom they could not rule; but ſeveral of the company affirming they ſaw ſome of the ſaid Indians at <hi>Caſco</hi> engaged in hoſtility againſt the Engliſh, it was reſolved not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into any league of peace with them, but rather to fight them, or ſurprize them after they had diſpatched the buſineſs about the captives.</p>
            <p>THIS being determined, the Major with five of his men went on ſhore, with part of the ranſom, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to beget a confidence in them, and then to return on board again, and fit his men for further ſervice; but if he had not wiſely provided againſt all exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies beforehand, he might have been prevented from ever going on board any more, for ſtepping aſide a rod or two from the place for better circumſpection, he eſpied the point of a lance from under a board, hid there, as were other arms near by, for a treacherous deſign that was in their minds, ſoon after, upon the receiving the reſt of the pay, to have been put into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution.
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:014120_0315_0F9302679B58B798"/>Whereupon Major <hi>Waldern</hi> took up the lance and came towards them, charging them with falſhood and treachery, for hiding weapons juſt by, wherewith to deſtroy them as ſoon as they had deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the goods. The Indians diſcovered their guilt by their countenances, ſome of them making towards him, thinking to get the weapon out of his hands; but he bid them ſtand off, threatning to kill every one that offered to touch him; and immediately waved his cap over his head (which was the ſign agreed upon for all the ſoldiers to come on ſhore in caſe of need) upon which token the ſoldiers all haſted away. In the mean time the Engliſh that went on ſhore to wait upon the Major, were forced to beſtir themſelves, both to ſecure the goods from being carried away, and to defend Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor <hi>Waldern.</hi> Some of the ſquaws, with others of the enemy ran away; one of them catched up a bundle of guns that were hid near by, and ran off with them. Captain <hi>Froſt</hi> ſeized an Indian called <hi>Megunnaway,</hi> a notorious rogue, (that had been in arms at <hi>Connecticut</hi> laſt <hi>June,</hi> at the <hi>Falls,</hi> and ſaw the brave and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Captain <hi>Turner,</hi> when he was ſlain about <hi>Green-River;</hi> and helped to kill <hi>Thomas Bracket</hi> at <hi>Caſco</hi> in <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt) and with the help of Lieut. <hi>Nutter,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Major's order, carried him on board, while himſelf ſearching about farther, found three guns hid in a cow-houſe juſt at hand, wherewith he armed the other three men that were with him. By this time ſome of the ſoldiers were got aſhore, and inſtantly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Major's command, purſued the enemy towards their canoes; in the chace ſeveral of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my were ſlain, whoſe bodies were found at their return to the number of ſeven, amongſt whom was <hi>Mattaban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> the Sagamore, with an old Powaw, to whom the Devil had revealed, as ſometimes he did to <hi>Saul,</hi> that on the ſame day he ſhould be with him; for he had a little before told the Indians, that within two days the Engliſh would come and kill them all, which was at the very ſame time verified upon himſelf. The body of our men overtook them before they all recovered their canoes, ſo that without doubt, divers others of
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:014120_0316_0F9302685E315EC0"/>them were ſlain likewiſe, for they ſunk a canoe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were five drowned before their eyes, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were not able to paddle; four they took priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, whom they brought away with them. There was about 25 Indians preſent at this encounter.</p>
            <p>MUCH more damage might have been done by our men upon the enemy, if they had known the moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect way to their canoes; but the Indians having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared all things ready for flight, as well as for fight, the more eaſily made their eſcape. One of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives was ſiſter to <hi>Madockawando,</hi> who was entertained very courteouſly by the Commander in Chief, and would have been carried forthwith to her brother, in hopes by her means to have gained the better terms for our remaining Engliſh captives, had it not been certainly known that he was gone from home upon a hunting deſign, and not to return in two months.</p>
            <p>THE Engliſh took much plunder from the Indians, about a thouſand weight of dried beef, with other things. <hi>Megunnaway</hi> was ſhot to death the ſame day or the next; ſo that juſtice is by degrees purſuing thoſe perfidious villains, and one after another they are brought under the wheel of deſtruction. <hi>Simon,</hi> that arch traitor, ſeems as is ſaid, by his conſumptive looks, to have received the ſentence of death, which may bring him into the ſame place or ſtate with the reſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Feb.</hi> 28th, they ſet ſail for <hi>Sheepſcot,</hi> but the wind failing, they put in at <hi>Kennebeck,</hi> from whence Capt. <hi>Fiſk</hi> with 40 men, were ſent to the ſaid place to ſeek after plunder, where they found between 30 and 40 buſhels of good wheat, which they brought away with them; ſeveral other things they lighted upon here and there, ſome of which were brought away, ſuch as, one or two great guns, ſome anchors from <hi>Sagadahock,</hi> and boards from <hi>Arowſick,</hi> where they found an hundred thouſand foot, of which they brought home enough for
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:014120_0317_0F93026919121B28"/>the lading of their veſſels, leaving the reſt to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in a more convenient ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>WHILE our ſoldiers were upon <hi>Arowſick,</hi> two of the enemy chanced to come upon the place, one of them inſtantly received his reward, the other received his payment in part, which however is ſuppoſed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to the whole, the canoe wherein he was eſcape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, being found the next day all bloody, and ſplit aſunder.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> 1ſt, one of the Indian ſquaws, a captive, was ſent to <hi>Taconet</hi> fort, with a meſſage to the Sagamores to treat for the reſt of the captives. Five days were given her to return, which were not expired, when Major <hi>Waldern,</hi> with moſt of the ſoldiers were called to return home towards <hi>Boſton,</hi> where they arrived on the 11th of <hi>March,</hi> 1676—7, having firſt put in at <hi>Portſmouth;</hi> bringing along with them the bones, or rather the body of Capt. <hi>Lake,</hi> preſerved entire and whole, and free from putrefaction by the coldneſs of the long winter, ſo as it was when found, by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of one that was near him when he was ſlain, eaſily diſcerned to be his, by ſuch as had known him before.</p>
            <p>IT is ſuppoſed by thoſe that returned, that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my are by this encounter of the Engliſh ſo ſcattered and broken, that they will not be able to rally again ſuddenly, or make any attempt hereafter, if the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent advantage be ſeriouſly purſued. Thus have out enemies, many of them, fallen into the pit themſelves, which they have been digging for others.</p>
            <p>THIS day alſo letters were received from Major <hi>Pynchon,</hi> of <hi>Springfield,</hi> but without mention of any appearance of the enemy in that quarter; whereby we are encouraged to believe, that they have ſtumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and fallen down backward, ſo that they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver riſe any more to make farther diſturbance. That
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:014120_0318_0F930269DA4098A8"/>which crowned the preſent ſervice was the performing it without loſs of blood; all ſafely returning. <hi>Let them accordingly remember to pay a ſuitable tributs of thankfulneſs to him,</hi> under whoſe banner they went forth and returned in ſafety.</p>
