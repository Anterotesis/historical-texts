            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>IN the Year 1674. Mr. <hi>Benjamin Church</hi> of <hi>Duxbury</hi> being providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially at <hi>Plymouth</hi> in the time of the Court, fell into acquaintance with Capt. <hi>John Almy</hi> of <hi>Rhode-Iſland.</hi> Capt. <hi>Almy</hi> with great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity invited him to ride with him, and view that part of <hi>Plymouth</hi> Colony that lay next to <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> known then by their Indian Names of <hi>Pocaſſet</hi> &amp; <hi>Segkonate.</hi> Among other arguments to perſwade him, he told him, the Soil was very rich, and the Situation pleaſant. Perſwades him by all means, to purchaſe of the Company ſome of the Court grant rights. He accepted his invitation, views the Country, &amp; was pleaſed with it; makes a purchaſe, ſettled a Farm, found the Gentlemen of the Iſland very Civil &amp; obliging. And being himſelf a Perſon of uncommon Activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Induſtry, he ſoon erected two buildings upon his Farm, and gain'd a good acquaintance with the Natives: got much into their favour, and was in a little time in great eſteem among them.</p>
            <p>The next Spring advancing, while Mr. <hi>Church</hi> was diligently Settling his new Farm, ſtocking, leaſing &amp; diſpoſing of his Affairs, and had a fine proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of doing no ſmall things; and hoping that his good ſucceſs would be inviting unto other good Men to become his Neighbours; Behold! the rumour of a War between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the Natives gave check to his projects. People began to be very jealous of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and indeed they had no ſmall reaſon to ſuſpect that they had form'd a deſign of War upon the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Mr. <hi>Church</hi> had it daily ſuggeſted to him that the Indians were plotting a bloody deſign. That <hi>Philip</hi> the great <hi>Mount-hope</hi> Sachem was Leader therein: and ſo it prov'd, he was ſending his Meſſengers to all
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001800_0005_0FB82C0CA045EAC8"/>the Neighbouring Sachem:, to ingage them in a Confederacy with him in the War.</p>
            <p>Among the reft he ſent Six Men to <hi>Awaſhonks</hi> Squaw-Sachem of the <hi>Seg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>konate</hi> Indians, to engage her in his Intereſts: <hi>Awaſhonks</hi> ſo far liſtened unto them as to call her Subjects together, to make a great Dance, which is the cuſtom of that Nation when they adviſe about Momentous Affairs. But what does <hi>Awaſhonks</hi> do, but ſends away two of her Men that well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Language (<hi>Saſſamon</hi> and <hi>George</hi> by Name) to invite Mr. <hi>Church</hi> to the Dance. Mr. <hi>Church</hi> upon the Invitation, immediately takes with him <hi>Charles Hazelton</hi> his Tennants Son, who well underſtood <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               </gap> Language, and rid down to the Place appointed: Where they found hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of <hi>Indians</hi> gathered together from all Parts of her Dominion. <hi>Awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhonks</hi> her ſelf in a foaming Sweat was leading the Dance. But ſhe was no ſooner ſenſible of Mr. <hi>Churches</hi> arrival, but ſhe broke off, ſat down, calls her Nobles round her, orders Mr. <hi>Church</hi> to be invited into her preſence. Complements being paſt, and each one taking Seats. She told him, King <hi>Philip</hi> had ſent Six Men of his with two of her People that had been over at <hi>Mount-hope,</hi> to draw her into a confederacy with him in a War with the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Deſiring him to give her his advice in the caſe, and to tell her the Truth whether the <hi>Umpame</hi> Men (as <hi>Philip</hi> had told her) were gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great Army to invade <hi>Philips</hi> Country. He aſſured her he would tell her the Truth, and give her his beſt advice. Then he told her twas but a few days ſince he came from <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were then making no Preparations for War; That he was in Company with the Principal Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the Government, who had no Diſcourſe at all about War; and he believ'd no tho'ts about it. He ask'd her whether ſhe tho't he would have brought up his Goods to Settle in that Place, if he apprehended an entering into War with ſo near a Neighbour. She ſeem'd to be ſome what convin'd by his talk, and ſaid ſhe believ'd he ſpoke the Truth.</p>
            <p>Then ſhe called for the <hi>Mount-hope</hi> Men: Who made a formidable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, with their Faces Painted, and their Hair Trim'd up in Com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That for his own part, tho' he deſired nothing more than Peace, yet if nothing but Was would ſatisfie them, he believed he ſhould prove a ſharp thorne in their ſides; Bid the Company obſerve thoſe Men that were of ſuch bloody diſpoſitions, whether Providence would ſuffer them to Live to ſee the event of the War, which others more Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably diſpoſed might do.</p>

            <p>The Enemy who began their Hoſtilities with plundring and deſtroying Cattel, did not long content themſelves with that game.

            <p>The Enemy fluſh'd with theſe exploits, grew yet bolder, and skulking every where in the buſnes, ſhot at all Paſſengers, and kill'd many that ventured abroad.

            <p>This party were no ſooner over <hi>Miles</hi>'s Bridge but were fired on by an Ambuſcado of about a dozen <hi>Indians,</hi> as they were afterwards diſcovered to be. When they drew off the Pilot was Mortally wounded, Mr. <hi>Belcher</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a ſhot in his knee, and his Horſe was kill'd under him, Mr. <hi>Gill</hi> was ſtruck with a Musket-ball on the ſide of his belly; but being clad with a buff Coat and ſome thickneſs of Paper under it, it never broke his skin.

            <p>Upon this 'twas immediately reſolv'd, and orders were given to March down into the Neck, and having paſſed the Bridge, and Caſſey, the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was to extend both wings, which being not well headed, by thoſe that remain'd in the Center, ſome of them miſtook their Friends for their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and made a fire upon them on the right wing, and wounded that noble Heroick Youth Enſign <hi>Savage</hi> in the thigh; but it happily prov'd but a fleſh wound.

            <p>A grand Council was held, and a Reſolve paſt, to build a Fort there to maintain the firſt ground they had gain'd, by the Indians leaving it to them.

And with all, an order for Capt. <hi>Fuller</hi> with Six files to croſs the River to the ſide ſo much inſiſted on, and to try if he could get Speech with any of the <hi>Pocaſſet</hi> or <hi>Sogkonate</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, and that Mr. <hi>Church</hi> ſhould go his Second. Upon the Captains re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his orders, he ask'd Mr. <hi>Church</hi> whither he was willing to engage in this interprize: To whom 'twas indeed too agreeable to be declined; tho' he thought the enterprize was hazardous enough, for them to have more Men aſſign'd them. Capt. <hi>Fuller</hi> told him that for his own part he was grown Ancient and heavy, he feared the travel and fatigue would be too much for him. But Mr. <hi>Church</hi> urged him, and told him, he would thearfully excuſe him, his hardſhip and travel, and take that part to himſelf, if he might but go; for he had rather do any thing in the World than ſtay there to build the Fort.</p>
            <p>Then they drew out the Number aſſigned them and March'd the ſame Night to the Ferry, and were tranſported to <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> from whence the next Night they got a paſſage over to <hi>Pocaſſet</hi>-ſide in <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> Boats, and concluded there to diſpoſe themſelves in two Ambuſcado's before day, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to ſurprize ſome of the Enemy by their falling into one or other of their Ambuſments. But Capt. <hi>Fullers</hi> party being troubled with the Epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical plague of luſt after Tobacco, muſt needs ſtrike fire to Smoke it; and thereby diſcovered themſelves to a party of the Enemy coming up to them, who immediately fled with great preciptation.</p>
            <p>This Ambuſcado drew off about break of day, perceiving they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd, the other continued in their Poſt until the time aſſigned them, and the light and heat of the Sun rendred their Station both inſignificant and troubleſome, and then return'd, unto the place of Randezvous, where they were acquainted with the other parties diſappointment, and the occaſion of it.

But ſome of the Company had reflected upon Mr. <hi>Church,</hi> that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his talk on the other ſide of the River, he had not ſhewn them any <hi>Indians</hi> ſince they came over.

            <p>Their next Motion was immediately into the Peaſe field. When they came to the Fence Mr <hi>Church</hi>

But caſting his Eyes to the ſide of the Hill above them; the hill ſeem'd to move, being covered over with <hi>Indians,</hi> with their bright Guns glittering in the Sun, and running in a circumference with a deſign to ſurround them.</p>
            <p>Seeing ſuch Multitudes ſurrounding him and his little Company; it put him upon thinking what was become of the Boats that were ordered to attend him: And looking up, he ſpy'd them a-ſhore at <hi>Sandy-point</hi> on the Iſland ſide of the River, with a number of Horſe and Foot by them, and wondred what ſhould be the occaſion; until he was afterwards informed, That the Boats had been over that Morning from the Iſland and had land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Party of Men at <hi>Fogland,</hi> that were deſign'd in <hi>Punkatees</hi> Neck to fetch off ſome Cattel and Horſes, but were Ambuſcado<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Now our Gentlemans Courage and Conduct were both put to the Teſt, the incourages his Men; and orders ſome to run and take a Wall to ſhelter before the Enemy gain'd it. Twas time for them now to think of eſcaping if they knew which way. Mr. <hi>Church</hi> orders his Men to ſtrip to their white Shirts, that the <hi>Iſlanders</hi> might diſcover them to be Engliſh Men; &amp; then orders Three Guns to be fired diſtinct, hoping it might be obſerv'd by their friends on the oppoſite Shore. The Men that were ordered to take the Wall being very hungry, ſtop'd a while among the Peaſe to gather a few, being about four Rod from the Wall; the Enemy from behind it hail'd them with a Shower of Bullets; but ſoon all but one came tumbling over an old hedge down the bank where Mr. <hi>Church</hi> and the reſt were, and told him that his Brother <hi>B.

And yet to add to the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of this little handful of diſtreſſed Men; The <hi>Indians</hi> alſo poſſeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the Ruines of a Stone-houſe that over look'd them, and of the black Rocks to the Southward of them; ſo that now they had no way to prevent lying quite open to ſome, or other of the Enemy, but to heap up Stones before them, as they did, and ſtill bravely and wonderfully defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, againſt all the numbers of the Enemy. At length came over one of the Boats from the Iſland Shore, but the Enemy ply'd their Shot ſo warmly to her as made her keep at ſome diſtance; Mr. <hi>Church</hi> deſired them to ſend their Canoo a-ſhore to fetch them on board; but no perſwaſions, nor ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments could prevail with them to bring their Canoo to ſhore. Which ſome of Mr. <hi>Churches</hi> Men perceiving, began to cry out, <hi>For God's ſake to take them off, for their Ammunition was ſpent,</hi> &amp;c. Mr. <hi>Church</hi> being ſenſible of the danger of the Enemies hearing their Complaints, and being made acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the weakneſs and ſcantineſs of their Ammunition, fiercely called to the Boats-maſter, and bid either ſend his Canoo a-ſhore, or elſe begone preſently, or he would fire upon him.</p>
            <p>Away goes the Boat and leaves them ſtill to ſhift for themſelves. But then another difficulty aroſe; the Enemy ſeeing the Boat leave them, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animated &amp; fired thicker &amp; faſter than ever; Upon which ſome of the Men that were lighteſt of foot, began to talk of attempting an eſcape by flight: until Mr. <hi>Church</hi> ſollidly convinc'd them of the impracticableneſs of it; and incouraged them yet, told them, <hi>That be had obſerv'd ſo much of the remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and wonderful Providence of God hitherto preſerving them, that incouraged him to believe with much confidence th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

One of them by Mr. <hi>Churches</hi> order was pitching a flat Stone up an end before him in the Sand, when a Bullet from the Enemy with a full force ſtroke the Stone while he was pitching it an end; which put the poor fellow to a miſerable ſtart, till Mr. <hi>Church</hi> call'd upon him to obſerve, <hi>How God directed the Bullets that the Enemy could not hit him when in the ſame place, yet could hit the Stone as it was erected.</hi>

            <p>The Canoo came aſhore, but was ſo ſmall that ſhe would not bare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove two Mea at a time; and when two were got aboard, they turn'd her looſe to drive aſhore for two more: and the Sloops company kept the <hi>Indians</hi> in play the while. But when at laſt it came to Mr. <hi>Churches</hi> turn to go aboard, he had left his Hat and Cutlaſh at the Well where he went to drink when he fiſt came down; he told his Company, <hi>He would never go off and leave his Hat and Cutlaſh for the</hi> Indians; <hi>they ſhould never have that to reflect upon him.</hi> Tho 'he was much diffwaded from it, yet he would go fetch them. He put all the Powder he had left into his Gun (and a poor charge it was) and went preſenting his Gun at the Enemy, until he took up what he went for; at his return be diſcharged his Gun at the Enemy to bid them farewel, for that time; but had not Powder enough to carry the Bullet half way to them.</p>
            <p>Two Bullets from the Enemy ſtuck the Canoo as he went on Board, one grazed the hair of his Head a little before; another ſtruck in a ſmall Stake that ſtood right againſt the middle of his Breaſt.</p>

After this <hi>Dartmouths</hi> diſtreſſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Succour, great Part of the Town being laid deſolate, and many of the Inhabitants kill'd; the moſt of <hi>Plymouth</hi> Forces were order'd thither: And coming to <hi>Ruſſels</hi> Garriſon at <hi>Poneganſet,</hi> they met with a Number of the Enemy that had ſurrendred themſelves Priſoners on terms promiſed by Capt. <hi>Eels</hi> of the Garriſon; and <hi>Ralph Earl</hi> that perſwaded them (by a friend <hi>Indian</hi> he had employed) to come in.

But while theſe things were acting at <hi>Dartmouth, Philip</hi> made his eſcape, leaving his Country, fled over <hi>Taunton</hi>-River, and <hi>Reboboth</hi>-Plain, and <hi>Petuxet</hi>-River, where Capt <hi>Edmunds</hi> of <hi>Providence</hi> made ſome ſpoil upon; and had proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly done more, but was prevented by the coming up of a Superiour Officer, that put him by. And now another Fort was built at <hi>Pocaſſet,</hi> that prov'd a troubleſome and chargeable as that at <hi>Mount-hope;</hi> and the remainder of the Summer was improv'd in providing for the Forts and Forces there maintained, while our Enemies were fled ſome hundreds of Miles into the Country, near as far as <hi>Albany.</hi> And now ſtrong Suſpicions began to ariſe of the <hi>Narraganſet Indians,</hi> that they were ill affected, and deſigned miſchief; and ſo the event ſoon diſcovered.

But Mr. <hi>Church</hi> meeting with fair Winds arriv'd ſafe at the Major's Garriſon in the evening. And ſoon began to inquire after the Enemies Reſorts, Wigwams or Sleeping Places; and having gain'd ſome intelligence, he propoſed to the <hi>Eldriges,</hi> and ſome other brisk hands, that he met with, to attempt the Surprizing of ſome of the Enemy to make a Preſent of to the General, when he ſhould arrive: which might advantage his deſign; being brisk blades, they readily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd with the motion, and were ſoor upon their March. The Night was very cold, but bleſs'd with the <hi>Moon;</hi> before the day broke they effected their exploit, and by the riſing of the Sun arrived at the Major's Garriſon, where they met the General and preſented him with Eighteen of the Enemy they had Captiv'd. The General pleas'd with the exploit, gave them thanks, particularly to Mr. <hi>Church,</hi> the mover and chief actor of the buſineſs; and ſending two of them (likely Boys) a preſent to <hi>Boſton;</hi> ſmiling on Mr. <hi>Church,</hi> told him, <hi>That he made no doubt but his Faculty would ſupply them with</hi> Indian Boys <hi>enough before the War was ended.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their next move was to a Swamp which the <hi>Indians</hi> had Fortifyed with a Fort. Mr. <hi>Church</hi> rid in the Generals guard when the bloudy ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment began; but being impatient of being out of the heat of the action, importunately beg'd leave of the General that he might run down to the aſſiſtance of his friends, the General yielded to his requeſt, provided he could rally ſome hands to go with him. Thirty Men immediately drew out and followed him: They entred the Swamp and paſſed over the Log, that was the paſſage into the Fort, where they ſaw many Men and ſeveral Valiant Captains lye ſlain: Mr. <hi>Church</hi> ſpying Capt. <hi>Gardner</hi> of <hi>Salem</hi> amidſt the Wigwams in the Eaſt end of the Fort, made towards him, but on a ſudden, while they were looking each other in the Face, Capt. <hi>Gardner</hi> ſettled down, Mr. <hi>Church</hi> ſtep'd to him and ſeeing the blood run down his cheek lifted up his Cap and calling him by his Name; he look'd up in his Face, but ſpoke not a Word, being Mortally Shot thro' the head; and obſerving his Wound, Mr. <hi>Church</hi> found the ball entred his head on the ſide that was next the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> entred the Swamp. Upon which, having ordered ſome care to be taken of the Captain, he diſpatch'd information to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral that the beſt and forwardeſt of his Army that hazarded their lives to enter the Fort, upon the muzzle of the Enemies Guns, were Shot in their backs, and kill'd by them that lay behind. Mr. <hi>Church</hi> with his ſmall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany haſten'd out of the Fort (that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were now poſſeſſed of) to get a Shot at the <hi>Indians</hi> that were in the Swamp, &amp; kept firing upon them. He ſoon met with a broad bloody track, where the Enemy had fled with their Wounded men; following hard in the tract, he ſoon ſpy'd one of the Enemy, who clap'd his Gun a-croſs his breaſt, made towards Mr. <hi>Church,</hi> and beckned to him with his hand; Mr. <hi>Church</hi> immediately commanded
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001800_0018_0FB82CBF658149B0"/>no Man to hurt him, hoping by him to have gain'd ſome intelligence of the Enemy, that might be of advantage; but it unhappily fell out that a Fellow that had lag'd behind coming up, ſhot down the <hi>Indian,</hi> to Mr. <hi>Church</hi>'s great grief and diſappointment. But immediately they heard a great ſhout of the Enemy, which ſeem'd to be behind them, or between them and the Fort; and diſcover'd them running from tree to tree to gain advantages of firing upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that were in the Fort. Mr. <hi>Churches</hi> great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty now was how to diſcover himſelf to his Friends in the Fort, uſing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral inventions, till at length gain'd an opportunity to call to, and inform a Serjeant in the Fort, that he was there, and might be expoſed to their Shots, unleſs they obſerv'd it. By this time he diſcovered a number of the Enemy almoſt within Shot of him, making towards the Fort; Mr. <hi>Church</hi> and his Company were favoured by a heap of bruſh that was between them and the Enemy, and prevented their being diſcover'd to them. Mr. <hi>Church</hi> had given his Men their particular orders for firing upon the Enemy; and as they were riſing up to make their Shot, the afore mentioned Serjeant in the Fort called out to them, <hi>for God's ſake not to fire, for be believed they were ſome of their</hi> Friend Indians; they clap'd down again, but were ſoon ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Serjeants miſtake. The Enemy got to the top of the Tree, the body whereof the Serjeant ſtood upon, and there clap'd down out of ſight of the Fort, but all this while never diſcovered Mr. <hi>Church,</hi> who obſerved them to keep gathering unto that Place, until there ſeem'd to be a formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable black heap of them. <hi>Now brave boys</hi> (ſaid Mr. <hi>Church</hi> to his Men) <hi>if we mind our bits, we may have a brave Shot, and let our ſign for firing on them, be their riſing up to fire into the Fort.</hi> It was not long before the <hi>Indians</hi> riſing up as one body, deſigning to pour a Volley into the Fort. When our <hi>Church</hi> nimbly ſtarted up and gave them ſuch a round Volley, and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected clap on their backs, that they who eſcaped with their Lives, were ſo ſurprized, that they ſcampered, they knew not whether themſelves; about a dozen of them ran right over the Log into the Fort, and took into a ſort of a Hovel that was build with Poles, after the manner of a corn crib. Mr. <hi>Church</hi>'s Men having their Catteridges fix'd, were ſoon ready to obey his order, which was immediately to charge and run on upon the Hovel, and over-ſet it, calling as he run on to ſome that were in the Fort to aſſiſt him in over-ſetting of it; they no ſooner came to Face the Enemies ſhelter, but Mr. <hi>Church</hi> diſcover'd that one of them had found a hole to point his Gun through, right at him; but however incouraged his Company, and ran right on, till he was ſtruck with Three Bullets, one in his Thigh, which was near half of it cut off as it glanced on the joynt of the Hip-bone; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thro' the gatherings of his Breeches and Draws, with a ſmall fleſh Wound; a third peirced his Pocket, and wounded a pair of Mittins, that he had borrowed of Capt. <hi>Prentice;</hi> being wrap'd up together had the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune

And burning up all the Houſes and Proviſions in the Fort; the Army return'd the ſame Night in the Storm and Cold: And I Suppoſe every one that is acquainted with the circumſtances of that Nights March, deeply laments the miſeries that attended them, eſpecially the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001800_0020_0FB82CC2C7924350"/>wounded &amp; dying Men. But it mercifully came to paſs that Capt. <hi>Andrew Belcher</hi> arrived at Mr. <hi>Smiths</hi> that very Night from <hi>Boſton,</hi> with a Veſſel loaden with Proviſions for the Army, who muſt otherwiſe have periſh'd for want Some of the Enemy that were then in the Fort have ſince inform'd as, that near a third of the <hi>Indians</hi> belonging to all that <hi>Narraganſet Country</hi> were killed by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and by the Cold that Night, that they fled out of their Fort ſo haſtily that they carried nothing with them: that if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had kept in the Fort, the <hi>Indians</hi> had certainly been neceſſitated, either to ſurrender themſelves to them, or to have periſhed by Hunger, and the ſeverity of the Seaſon. Some time after this Fort-ſight a certain <hi>Sog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honate Indian</hi> hearing Mr. <hi>Church</hi> relate the manner of his being wounded, told him, <hi>That he did not know but he himſelf was the</hi> Indian <hi>that wounded him, for that he was one of that company of</hi> Indians <hi>that Mr.</hi> Church <hi>made a Shot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on when they were riſing up to make a Shot into the Fort; they were in number a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 60 or 70, that juſt then came down from</hi> Pumhams <hi>Town, and never before then fired a Gun againſt the</hi> Engliſh; <hi>that when Mr.</hi> Church <hi>fired upon them he killed 14 dead in the Spot, and wounded a greater number than he killed, many of which dyed afterwards with their wounds, in the Cold and Storm the following Night.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Church</hi> was mov'd with other wounded men over to <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> where in about a Months time he was in ſome good meaſure recovered of his Wounds, and the Fever that attended them.

            <p>But the Generals great importunity again perſwaded him, to accompany him in a long March, into the <hi>Nipmuck</hi> Country, tho' he had then Tents in his Wounds, and ſo Lame as not able to Mount his Horſe without two Mens aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>In this March the firſt thing remarkable was, they came to an <hi>Indian</hi> Town, where there were many <hi>Wigwams</hi> in ſight, but an Icy Swamp ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between them and the <hi>Wigwams,</hi> prevented their running at once upon it as they intended: there was much firing upon each ſide before they paſs'd the Swamp. But at length the Enemy all fled, and a certain <hi>Moobegan</hi> that was a friend <hi>Indian,</hi> purſued and ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Some were for torturing of him to bring him to a more ample confeſſion, of what he knew concerning his Country-men. Mr. <hi>Church</hi> verily believing he had been ingenious in his confeſſion, interceeded and prevailed for his eſcaping torture. But the Army being bound forward in their March, and the <hi>Indians</hi> wound ſomewhat diſinabling him for Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling, 'twas concluded he ſhould be knock'd on the Head: Accordingly he was brought before a great fire, and the <hi>Moobegan</hi> that took him was allowed, as he deſired, to be the Executiner. Mr.<hi>Church</hi> taking no delight
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001800_0021_0FB82CC4A4D9AF70"/>in the Sport, fram'd an arrant at ſome diſtance among the baggage Horſes, and when he had got ſome Ten Rods, or thereabouts from the fire, the Executioner fetching a blow with his Hatchet at the head of the Priſoner, he being aware of the blow, dodged his aſide, and the Executioner miſſing his ſtroke the Hatchet ſlew out of his hand, and had like to have done ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution where 'twas not deſign'd. The Priſoner upon his narrow eſcape broke from them that held him, and notwithſtanding his Wound made uſe of his Legs, and hap'd to run right upon Mr. <hi>Church,</hi> who laid hold on him, and a cloſe skuffle they had, but the <hi>Indian</hi> having no Clothes on ſlip'd from him, and ran again, and Mr. <hi>Church</hi> purſued the <hi>Indian,</hi> altho' being Lame, there was no great odds in the Race, until the <hi>Indian</hi> ſtumbled and fell, and they cloſed again, skuffled and ſought pretty ſmartly, until the <hi>Indian</hi> by the advantage of his nakedneſs ſlip'd from his hold again, and ſet out on his third Race, with Mr. <hi>Church</hi> cloſe at his heels, endeavouring to lay hold on the hair of his Head, which was all the hold could be taken of him; and running thro' a Swamp that was covered with hollow Ice, it made ſo loud a noiſe that Mr. <hi>Church</hi> expected (but in vain) that ſome of his <hi>Engliſh</hi> friends would follow the noiſe, and come to his aſſiſtance. But the <hi>Indian</hi> hap'd to run a-thwart a mighty Tree that lay fallen near breaſt-high, where he ſtop'd, and cry'd out a loud for help; but Mr. <hi>Church</hi> being ſoon upon him again, the <hi>Indian</hi> ſeized him faſt by the hair of his Head, and endeavouring by twiſting to break his Neck; but tho' Mr. <hi>Churches</hi> wounds had ſome-what weakned him, and the <hi>Indian</hi> a ſtout fellow, yet he held him well in play, and twiſted the <hi>Indians</hi> Neck as well, and took the advantage of many opportunities, while they hung by each others hair gave him noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious bunts in the face with his head. But in the heat of this skuffle they heard the Ice break with ſome bodies coming a-pace to them, which when they heard, <hi>Church</hi> concluded there was help for one or other of them, but was doubtful which of them muſt now receive the fatal ſtroke; anon ſome body comes up to them, who prov'd to be the Indian that had firſt taken the Priſoner. Without ſpeaking a word, he felt them out (for 'twas ſo dark he could not diſtinguiſh them by ſight) the one being clothed, and the other naked, he felt where Mr. <hi>Churches</hi> hands were faſtned in the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tops hair, and with one blow ſettled his Hatchet in between them, and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſtrife. He then ſpoke to Mr. <hi>Church</hi> and hugg'd him in his Arms, and thank'd him abundantly for catching his Priſoner; and cut off the head of his Victim, and carried it to the Camp, and giving an account to the reſt of the friend Indians in the Camp, how Mr. <hi>Church</hi> had ſeized his Priſoner, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they all joyn'd a mighty ſhout.</p>
            <p>Proceeding in this March, they had the ſucceſs of killing many of the Enemy: until at length their Proviſion failing, they return'd home.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Philip</hi> (as was before hinted) was fled to a Place called <hi>Scattacook,</hi>

            <p>His next kennelling Place was at the falls of Connecticut River, where ſometime after Capt. <hi>Turner</hi> found him, came upon him by Night, kill'd him a great many Men, and frighted many more into the River, that were hurl'd down the falls and drowned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philip</hi> got over the River, and on the back ſide of the <hi>Wetuſet-hills</hi> meets with all the Remnants of the <hi>Narraganſet</hi> and <hi>Nipmuck Indians,</hi> that were there gathered together, and became very numerous; and made their deſcent on <hi>Sudbury,</hi> and the Adjacent Parts of the Country, where they met with and ſwallowed up Valiant Capt. <hi>Wadſworth</hi> and his Company, and many other doleful deſolations, in thoſe Parts. The News whereof coming to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and they expecting probably the Enemy would ſoon return again into their Colony: The Council of War were called together; and Mr. <hi>Church</hi> was ſent for to them, being obſerved by the whole Colony to be a Perſon extraordinarily qualify'd for and adapted to the Affairs of War. Twas propoſed in Council that leaſt the Enemy in their return ſhould fall on <hi>Rehoboth,</hi> or ſome other of their Out-Towns, a Company conſiſting of 60 or 70 Men ſhould be ſent in to thoſe Parts; and Mr. <hi>Church</hi> invited to take the Command of them. He told them, <hi>That if the Enemy returned into that Colony again, they might reaſonably expect that they would come very numerous; and that if be ſhould take the Command of Men, he ſhould not lye in any Town or Garriſon with them, but would lye in the Woods as the Enemy did: And that to ſend out ſuch ſmall Companies againſt ſuch Multitudes of the Enemy that were now Muſtered together, would be but to deliver ſo many Men into their hands, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, as the Worthy Capt.</hi> Wadſworth <hi>and his Company were.</hi> His advice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole was. That if they ſent out any Forces, to ſend not leſs than 300 Souldiers; and that the other Colonies ſhould be ask'd to ſend out their <hi>Quota's</hi> alſo; adding, <hi>That if they intended to make an end of the War, by ſubduing the Enemy, they muſt make a buſineſs of the War, as the Enemy did; and that for his own part, he had wholly laid aſide all his own private buſineſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, ever ſince the War broke out.</hi> He told them, <hi>That if they would ſend forth ſuch Forces as he ſhould direct to, he would go with them for Six weeks March, which was long enough for Men to be kept in the Woods at once; and if they might be ſure of Liberty to return in ſuch a ſpace, Men would go out chearfully. And he would engage</hi> 150 <hi>of the heſt Souldiers ſhould immediately Liſt Voluntarily to go with him, if they would pleaſe to add</hi> 50 <hi>more; and</hi> 100 <hi>of the Friend Indians; and with ſuch on Army he made no doubt but he might do good Service; but on other terms he did not incline to be concern'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their reply was, That they were already in debt, and ſo big an Army would bring ſuch charge upon them, that they ſhould never be able to pay. And as for ſending out <hi>Indians,</hi> they thought it no wayes adviſable, and in ſhort, none of his advice practicable.</p>

            <p>Then preparing for his Removal, he went with his ſmall Family to <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> to take leave of their Friends; where they met with his Wives Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, who much perſwaded that She might be left at Mr. <hi>Clarks</hi> Garriſon, (which they ſuppoſed to be a mighty ſafe Place) or at leaſt that She might be there until her ſoon expected lying-inn was over (being near her time.)

Then the <hi>Indians</hi> appearing again, beckn'd and call'd in the <hi>Indian</hi> Language, and bid them come a-ſhore, they wanted to ſpeak with them. The <hi>Indians</hi> in the Canoo anſwered them again; but they on the Rocks told them, That the ſurff made ſuch a noiſe againſt the Rocks, they could not hear any thing they ſaid. Then Mr. <hi>Church</hi> by ſigns with his hands, gave to underſtand, That he would have two of them go down upon the point of the beach (a place where a Man might ſee who was near him) accordingly two of them ran a-long the beach, and met him there; without their Arms excepting that one of them had a Lance in his hand; they uged Mr. <hi>Church</hi> to come a-ſhore for they had a great deſire to have ſome diſcourſe with him; He told them, if he that had his weapon in his hand would carry it up ſome diſtance upon the beach and leave it, he would come a-ſhore and diſcourſe them: He did ſo, and Mr. <hi>Church</hi> went a-ſhore, halled up his Canoo, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered one of his <hi>Indians</hi> to ſtay by it, and the other to walk above on the beach, as a Sentinel to ſee that the Coaſts were clear. And when Mr. <hi>Church</hi> came up to the <hi>Indians,</hi> one of them happened to be honeſt <hi>George,</hi> one of the two that <hi>Awaſhonks</hi> formerly ſent to call him to her Dance, and was ſo careful to guard him back to his Houſe again; the laſt <hi>Sogkonate Indian</hi> he ſpoke with before the War broke out; he ſpoke <hi>Engliſh</hi> very well.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001800_0025_0FB82CCD789FCDC8"/>Mr. <hi>Church</hi> asked him where <hi>Awaſhonks</hi> was? he told him in a Swamp about three Miles off. Mr. <hi>Church</hi> again asked him, What it was he wanted that he hollowed and called him a-ſhore? he anſwered, That he took him for <hi>Church</hi> as ſoon as he heard his Voice in the Canoo, and that he was very glad to ſee him alive, and he believed his Miſtriſs would be as glad to ſee him, and ſpeak with him; he told him further, That he believed ſhe was not fond of maintaining a War with the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and that ſhe had left <hi>Philip,</hi> and did not intend to return to him any more; he was mighty ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt with Mr. <hi>Church</hi> to tarry there while he would run and call her: but he told him no; for he did not know but the <hi>Indians</hi> would come down and kill him before he could get back again; he ſaid, if <hi>Mount-hope</hi> or <hi>Poceſſet Indians</hi> could catch him, he believed they would knock him on the head: But all <hi>Sogkonate Indians</hi> knew him very well, and he believed would none of them hurt him.

            <p>Mr. <hi>Church</hi> told them, <hi>That it had ever been in his thoughts ſince the War broke out, that if he could diſcourſe the</hi> Sogkonate Indians, <hi>he could draw them off from</hi> Philip, <hi>and employ them againſt him; but could, till now, never have an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to ſpeak with any of them, and was very lothe to l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At length, they told him, If he would go, it ſhould be only with the two <hi>Indians</hi> that came with him; but they would give him no permit under their hands. He took his leave of them, Reſolving to proſecute his deſign; they told him they were ſorry to ſee him ſo Reſolute, nor if he went did they ever expect to ſee his face again.</p>
            <p>He bought a Bottle of Rhum, and a ſmall role of Tobacco, to carry with him, and returned to his Family. The next Morning, being the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001800_0026_0FB82CCFA3EFB8E8"/>for the Meeting, he prepared two light Canoo's for the deſign, and his own Man, with the two <hi>Indians</hi> for his company. He uſed ſuch argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with his tender, and now almoſt broken hearted Wiſe, from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of former preſervations, and the proſpect of the great Service he might do, might it pleaſe God to ſucceed his deſign, &amp;c. that he obtained her conſent to his attempt; and committing her, his Babes and himſelf to Heavens protection. He ſet out, they had from the Shore about a League to paddle; drawing near the place they ſaw the <hi>Indians</hi> ſetting on the bank, watring for their coming. Mr. <hi>Church</hi> ſent one of the <hi>Indians</hi> a-ſhore in one of the Canoo's, to ſee whither it were the ſame <hi>Indians</hi> whom he had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to meet him, and no more; and if ſo to ſtay a-ſhore and ſend <hi>George</hi> to fetch him. Accordingly <hi>George</hi> came and fetch'd Mr. <hi>Church</hi> a-ſhore, while the other Canoo play'd off to ſee the event, and to carry tydings if the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> ſhould prove falſe.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Church</hi> ask'd <hi>George</hi> Whether <hi>Awaſhonks</hi> and the other <hi>Indians</hi> he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to meet him were there? He anſwered they were. He then ask'd him, If there were no more than they whom he appointed to be there? To Which he would give him no direct anſwer. However he went a-ſhore, where he was no ſooner landed, but <hi>Awaſhonks</hi> and the reft that he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to meet him there, roſe up and came down to meet him; and each of them ſucceſſively gave him their hands, and expreſſed themſelves glad to ſee him, and gave him thanks for expoſing himſelf to viſit them. They walk'd together about a Gun-ſhot from the water to a convenient place to ſit down. Where at once a-roſe up a great body of <hi>Indians,</hi> who had lain hid in the graſs, (that was as high as a Mans waſte) and gathered round them, till they had clos'd them in; being all arm'd with Guns, Spears, Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chets, &amp;c. with their hair trim'd and faces painted, in their Warlike ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. It was doubtleſs ſome-what ſurprizing to our Gentleman at firſt, but without any viſible diſcovery of it, after a ſmall ſilent pauſe on each ſide, He ſpoke to <hi>Awaſhonks</hi> and told her, <hi>That</hi> George <hi>had inform'd him that ſee had a deſire to ſee him, and diſcourſe about making Peace with the</hi> Engliſh. She anſwered, Yes. Then ſaid Mr. <hi>Church, It is cuſtomary when People meet to treat of Peace to lay aſide their Arms, and not to appear in ſuch Hoſtile form as your People do:</hi> deſired of her that if they might talk about Peace, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired they might, <hi>Her men might lay aſide their Arms, and appear more treatable.</hi> Upon which there began a conſiderable noiſe and murmur among them in weir own Language. Till <hi>Awaſhonks</hi> ask'd him, What Arms they ſhould lay down, and where? He (perceiving the <hi>Indians</hi> look'd very ſurly, and much diſpleaſed) Replied, <hi>Only their Guns at ſome ſmall diſtance, for formality <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Mr. <hi>Church</hi> pulled out his Callebaſh and asked <hi>Awaſhonks, Whether ſhe had

               </gap>ther he ſwallowed any of the Rhum; he offered her the Shell, but ſhe deſired him to drink again firſt, He then told her, <hi>There was no poiſon in it,</hi> and pouring ſome into the Palm of his hand, ſup'd it up and took the Shell and drank to her again, and drank a good Swig which indeed was no more than he needed. Then they all ſtanding up, he ſaid to <hi>Awaſhonks, You wont drink for fear there ſhould be poiſon in it:</hi> And then handed it to a little ill look'd fellow, who catched it readily enough, and as greedily would have ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Liquor when he had it at his mouth; But Mr. <hi>Church</hi> catch'd him by the throat and took it from him, asking him, <hi>Whether he intended to ſwallow S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Shell being emptied, he pulled out his Tobacco, and having diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted it, they began to talk.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Awaſhonks</hi> demanded of him, the Reaſon why he had not (agreeable to his promiſe when ſhe ſaw him laſt) been down at <hi>Sogkonate</hi> before now; Saying that probably if he had come then according to his promiſe, they had never joyned with <hi>Philip</hi> againſt the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He told her he was prevented by the Wars breaking out ſo ſuddenly. And yet, he was afterwards coming down, &amp; came as far as <hi>Punkateeſe,</hi> where a great many <hi>Indians</hi> ſet upon him, and fought him a whole afternoon, tho' he did not come prepared to fight, had but Nineteen Men with him, whoſe chief deſign was to gain an Opportunity to diſcourſe ſome <hi>Sogkonate Indians.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this there at once aroſe a mighty Murmur, conſuſed noiſe, &amp; talk among the fierce lock'd Creatures, and all riſing up in an hubbub; and a great ſurly lock'd fellow took up his <hi>Tomh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Interpreter asked Mr. <hi>Church,</hi> if he underſtood what it was that the great fellow (they had hold of) ſaid? He anſwered him, No. Why, faid the Interpreter, He ſays, you killed his Brother at <hi>Punkateeſe,</hi> and therefore he thirſts for your blood. Mr. <hi>Church</hi> bid the Interpreter tell him that his Brother began firſt: That if he had kept as <hi>Sogkonate</hi> according to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and order, he ſhould not have hurt him.</p>
            <p>Then the chief Captain commanded <hi>Silence,</hi> and told them, That they ſhould talk no more about old things, &amp;c. and quell'd the tumult, ſo that they ſat down again, and began upon a diſcourſe of making Peace with the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Mr. <hi>Church</hi> ask'd them, <hi>What Propoſals they would make, and on what terms they would break their League with</hi> Philip? Deſiring them to make ſome Propoſals that he might carry to his Maſter's, telling them that it was not in his Power to conclude a Peace with them, but that he knew that if their Propoſals were reaſonable, the Government would not be unreaſonable,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001800_0028_0FB82CD2AC4A2280"/>and that he would uſe his Intereſt in the Government for them. And to encourage them to proceed, put them in mind that the <hi>Pequo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After ſome further diſcourfe, and debate, he brought them at length to conſent that if the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Plymouth</hi> would firmly ingage to them, <hi>That they, and all of them, and their Wives and Children, ſhould bave their Lives ſpared, and none of them tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported out of the Country, they would ſubject themſelves to them, and ſerve them in what they were able.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then Mr. <hi>Church</hi> told them, That he was well ſatisfyed the Government of <hi>Plymouth</hi> would readily concur with what they propoſed, and would ſign their Articles: And complementing them upon it, how pleaſed he was with the thoughts of their return, and of the former friendſhip that had been between them, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The chief Captain roſe up, and expreſſed the great value and reſpect he had for Mr. <hi>Church;</hi> and bowing to him ſaid, <hi>Sir, If you'l pleaſe to accept of me and my men, and will head us, we'l fight for you, and will help you to</hi> Philips <hi>Lead before Indian Corn be ripe</hi> And when he had ended, they all expreſs'd their conſent to what he ſaid, and told Mr. <hi>Church</hi> they loved him, and were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to go with him and fight for him, as long as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had one E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Mr. <hi>Church</hi> aſſured them, That if they proved as good as their word they ſhould find him their's and their Children's laft friend. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Then he propoſed unto them, that they ſhould chooſe five men to go ſtraight with him to <hi>Plymouth:</hi> They told him, No; they would not chooſe, but he ſhould take which five he pleaſed: ſome complements paſſed about it, at length it was agreed, They ſhould chooſe Three and he Two. Then he agreed, with that he would go back to the Iſland that Night, and would come to them the next Morning, and go thro' the Woods to <hi>Plymouth.</hi> But they afterwards objected, That this travelling thro' the Woods would not be ſafe for him; the Enemy might meet with them, and kill him, and then they ſhould loſe their friend, and the whole deſign ruined beſide. And therefore propoſed, That he ſhould come in an Engliſh Veſſel and they would meet him and come on board at <hi>Sogkonate-point,</hi> and Sail from thence to <hi>Sandwich:</hi> which in fine, was concluded upon.</p>
            <p>So Mr. <hi>Church</hi> promiſing to come as ſoon as he could poſſibly obtain a Veſſel, and then they parted. He returned to the Iſland, and was at great pains and charge to get a Veſſel, but with unaccountable diſappointments, ſometimes by the falſeneſs, and ſometimes by the faint-heartedneſs of Men that he bargained with, and ſomething by Wind and Weather, &amp;c.</p>

Until at length Mr.<hi>Anthony Low</hi> put into the Harbour with a loaden Veſſel bound to the Weſtward, and being made acquainted with Mr. <hi>Churches</hi> caſe, told him, <hi>That he had ſo much kindneſs for him, and was ſo pleaſed with the buſineſs that be was ingaged in, that be would run the venture of his Veſſel &amp; Cargo, to wait upon him.</hi> Accordingly, next Morning they ſet Sail with a Wind that ſoon brought them to <hi>Sogkonate-point;</hi> but coming there they met with a contrary wind, and a great ſwelling See.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> were there waiting upon the Rocks, but had nothing but a miſerable broken Canoo to get aboard in. Yet <hi>Peter Awaſhonks</hi> ventured off in it, and with a great deal of difficulty and danger got aboard. And by this time it began to Rain and Blow exceedingly, and forced them away up the Sound; and then went away thro' <hi>Briſtol</hi> Ferry, round the Iſland to <hi>New-port,</hi> carrying <hi>Peter</hi> with them.</p>
            <p>Then Mr. <hi>Church</hi> diſmiſs'd Mr. <hi>Low,</hi> and told him, <hi>That inaſmuch as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence oppos'd his going by Water, and he expected that the Army would be up in a few days, and probably if be ſhould be gone at that juncture, it might ruine the whole deſign; would therefore yield his Voyage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then he writ the account of his tranſactions with the <hi>Indians,</hi> and drew up the Propoſals, and Articles of Peace, and diſpatch'd <hi>Peter</hi> with them to <hi>Plymouth;</hi> that his Honour the Governour if he ſaw cauſe might ſign them.</p>

               <hi>Peter</hi> was ſet over to <hi>Sogkonate</hi> on the Lords day Morning, with orders to take thoſe men that were choſen to go down, or ſome of them at leaſt with him.

The Captain halted and told his <hi>Indian Souldiers, That they had heard as well as he, what ſome Men bad ſaid at</hi> Plymouth <hi>about them, &amp;c. That now was a good opportunity for each party to prove themſelves: The Track being divided they ſhould follow one, and the Engliſh the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, being equal in number.</hi> The <hi>Indians</hi> declined the Motion, and were not willing to move any where without him; ſaid <hi>they ſhould not think themſelves ſafe without him.</hi> But the Captain inſiſting upon it, they ſubmitted; he gave the <hi>Indians</hi> their choice to follow which track they pleaſed; they replyed, <hi>They were light and able to Travel, therefore of be pleaſed ther would take the Weſt Track.</hi> And appointing the Ruins of <hi>John Cooks</hi> Houſe at <hi>Cuſhnet</hi> for the place to meet at; each Company ſet out briskly to try their Fortunes. Capt. <hi>Church</hi> with his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Soldiers followed their Track until they came near entring a miery Swamp, when the Capt. heard a Whiſtle in the Rear, (which was a note for a halt) looking behind him, he ſaw <hi>William Fobes</hi> ſtart out of the Company and made towards him, who haſten'd to meet him as faſt as he could; <hi>Fobes</hi> told him they had diſcovered abundance of <hi>Indians,</hi> and if he pleaſed to go a few ſteps back he might ſee them himſelf: he did ſo, and ſaw them a-croſs the Swamp, obſerving them, he perceived they were gathering of <hi>Hurtle-Berries,</hi> and that they had no apprehenſions of their being ſo near them; The Captain ſuppoſed them to be chiefly Women, and therefore calling one Mr. <hi>Dillano,</hi> who was acquainted with the ground, and the Indian Language, and another named Mr. <hi>Barns;</hi> with theſe two Men he takes right thro' the Swamp as faſt as he could, and orders the reft to haſten after them.

And when he had turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, he began to look about him to ſee where he was, and what was become of his Company, hoping they might be all as well imploy'd as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but could find none but <hi>Dillano,</hi> who was very buſy gathering up Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; the Captain drove his that he had ſtop'd to the reſt, inquiring of <hi>Dillano</hi> for their Company, but could have no news of them. But moving back picked up now and then a skulking Priſoner by the way. When they came near the place where they firſt ſtarted the <hi>Indians,</hi> they diſcover'd their Company ſtanding in a body together, and had taken ſome few Priſoners; when they ſaw their Captain, they haſtened to meet him: They told him they found it difficult getting thro' the Swamp, and neither ſeeing nor hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing of him, they concluded the Enemy had kill'd him, and were at a great loſs what to do. Having brought their Priſoners together they found they had taken and kill'd 66 of the Enemy. Capt. <hi>Church</hi> then ask'd the old Squaw, <hi>What company they belonged unto?</hi> She ſaid, They belonged part to <hi>Philip,</hi> and part to <hi>Qunnappin</hi> and the <hi>Narraganſet-Sachem,</hi> diſcovered alſo upon her declaration that both <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Qunnappin</hi> were about two Miles off in the great Cedar Swamp; he enquired of her, <hi>What company they had with them?</hi> She anſwered, <hi>Abundance of Indians: The Swamp,</hi> ſhe ſaid, <hi>was full of Indians from one end unto the other, that were ſettled there, that there were near an 100 men came from the Swamp with them, and left them upon that plain to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hurtle-berry's, and promiſed to call them as they came back out of</hi> Sconticut-Neck, <hi>whither they went to kill Cattel and Horſes for Proviſions for the company.</hi> She perceiving Capt. <hi>Church</hi> move towards the Neck, told him, <hi>If they went that way they would all be kill'd.</hi> He ask'd her, <hi>Where-about they croſs'd the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver?</hi> She pointed to the upper paſſing place. Upon which Capt. <hi>Church</hi> paſſed over ſo low down as he thought it not probable they ſhould meet with his Track in their return; and haſtened towards the Iſland, where he left <hi>Little Eyes,</hi> with <hi>Light-foot.</hi> Finding a convenient place by the River ſide for the Securing their Priſoners, Capt <hi>Church,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dillano</hi> went down to ſee what was become of Capt. <hi>Light-foot,</hi> and the Priſoners left in his charge. <hi>Light-foot</hi> ſeeing and knowing them, ſoon came over with his broken Canoo; and inform'd them, <hi>That he had ſeen that day about 100 Men of the Enemy go down into</hi> Sconticut Neck, <hi>and that they were now returning again:</hi> Upon which they three ran down immediately to a Meadow where <hi>Light-foot</hi> ſaid the <hi>Indians</hi> had paſſed; where they not only ſaw their Tracks, but alſo them: Where-upon they lay cloſe until the Enemy came into the ſaid
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:001800_0039_0FB82CEFF348D478"/>Meadow, and the fore-moſt ſat down his load and halted until alſ the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany came up, and then took up their loads &amp; march'd again the ſame way that they came down into the Neck, which was the neareſt way unto their Camp; had they gone the other way along the River, they could not have miſſed Capt. <hi>Churches</hi> Track, which, would doubtleſs have expos'd them to the loſs of their Priſoners, if not of their lives. But as ſoon as the Coaſt was clear of them, the Captain ſends his <hi>Light-foot</hi> to fetch his Priſoners from the Iſland, while he and Mr. <hi>Dillano</hi> returns to the company, ſent part of them to conduct <hi>Light-foot</hi> &amp; his company to the aforeſaid Meadow, where Capt. <hi>Church</hi> and his company met them; croſſing the Enemies Track they made all haſt, until they got over <hi>Mattapoiſet-river,</hi> near about ſour Miles beyond the ruines of <hi>Cooks</hi> Houſe, where he appointed to meet his <hi>Indian</hi> company, whither he ſent <hi>Dillano,</hi> with two more to meet them; ordering them, that if the <hi>Indians</hi> were not arrived, to wait for them. Accordingly, finding no <hi>Indians</hi> there, they waited until late in the Night, when they arrived with their booty. They diſpatch'd a Poſt to their Captain to give him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Succeſs; but the day broke before they came to him: And when they had compared Succeſſes, they very remarkably found that the number that each Company had taken and ſlain, was equal. The <hi>Indians</hi> had kill'd 3 of the Enemy, and taken 63 Priſoners, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had done before them, both <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> were ſurpriz'd at this remarkable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and were both parties rejoycing at it; being both-before afraid of what might have been the event of the unequal Succeſs of the parties. But the <hi>Indians</hi> had the fortune to take more Arms than the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> They told the Captain, <hi>That they had miſſed a brave Opportunity by parting; They came upon a g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>That Night <hi>Philip</hi> ſent (as afterwards they found out) a great Army to way-lay Capt. <hi>Church</hi> at the entring on of <hi>Aſſawompſet</hi> Neck, expecting he would have returned the ſame way he went in; but that was never his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to return the ſame way that he came; &amp; at this time going another way he eſcaped falling into the hands of his Enemies. The next day they went home by <hi>Sapican,</hi> and got well with their Priſoners to <hi>Plymouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſoon went out again; and this ſtroke he drove many Weeks; and when he took any number of Priſoners, he would pick out ſome that he took a fancy to, and would tell them, <hi>He took a particular fancy to them, and had choſe them for himſelf to make Souldiers of; and if any would behave themſelves well, be would do well by them, and they ſhould be his men and not Sold out of the Country.</hi>

            <p>Capt. <hi>Church</hi> was in two particulars much advantaged by the great <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Army that was now abroad. One was, that they drove the Enemy down to that part of the Country, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Eaſtward of <hi>Taunton</hi> River by which means his buſineſs was nearer home. The other was that when ever he fell on with a puſh upon any body of the Enemy (were they never ſo many) they fled expecting the great Army. And his manner of Marching thro' the Woods was ſuch, as if he were diſcovered, they appeared to be more than they were. For the always Marched at a wide diſtance one from another, partly for their ſafety: and this was an <hi>Indian</hi> cuſtom, to March thin and ſcatter. Capt. <hi>Church</hi> inquired of ſome of the <hi>Indians</hi> that were become his Souldiers, <hi>How they got ſuch advantage often of the Engliſh in their Marches thro' the Woods?</hi> They told him, That the <hi>Indians</hi> gain'd great advantage of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by two things; The <hi>Indians</hi> always took care in their Marches and Fights, not to come too thick together. But the <hi>Engliſh</hi> always kept in a heap together, that it was as eaſy to hit them as to hit an Houſe. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was, that if at any time they diſcovered a company of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the Woods, they knew that there was all, for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> never ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; but the <hi>Indians</hi> always divided and ſcattered.</p>
            <p>Capt. <hi>Church</hi> now at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> ſomething or other happen'd that kept him at home a few days, until a Poſt came to <hi>Marſhfield</hi> on the Lords day Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, informing the Governour that a great Army of <hi>Indians</hi> were diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, who it was ſuppoſed were deſigning to get over the River towards <hi>Taunton</hi> or <hi>Bridgwater,</hi> to Attack thoſe Towns that lay on that ſide the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.

The Captain beſtirs himſelf, but found no Bread in the Store-houſe, and ſo was fore'd to run from Houſe to Houſe to get Houſe-hold Bread for their March; but this nor any thing elſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented his Marching by the beginning of the afternoon Exerciſe; March<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

But very unhappily it ſell out, that the very ſame time <hi>Philip</hi> had ſent two of his as a Scout upon his own Track, to ſee if none dog'd them; who ſpy'd the two <hi>Indian</hi> men, and turn'd ſhort about, and ſled with all ſpeed to their Camp: and Capt <hi>Church</hi> purſued as faſt as he could; the two <hi>Indians</hi> ſet a yelling and howling, and made the moſt hideous noiſe they could invent, ſoon gave the Alarm to <hi>Philip</hi> &amp; his Camp; who all ſled at the firſt tydings, left their Kittles boiling &amp; Meat roaſting upon their wooden Spits, &amp; run into a Swamp with no other Break-faſt, than what Capt. <hi>Church</hi> afterwards treated them with. Capt. <hi>Church</hi> purſuing, ſent Mr. <hi>Iſaac Howland</hi> with a party on one ſide of the Swamp, while himſelf with the reſt ran on the other-ſide, agreeing to run on each ſide, until they met on the further end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> placing ſome men in ſecure Stands at that end of the Swamp where <hi>Philip</hi> entered, concluding that if they headed him and beat him back, that he would take back in his own Track.

But <hi>Philip</hi> having waited all this while in vain, now moves on after the reſt of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to ſee what was become of them. And by this time Capt. <hi>Church</hi> was got into the Swamp ready to meet him; and as it happen'd made the firſt diſcovery, clapt behind a Tree until <hi>Philips</hi> company came pretty near, and then tired upon them, kill'd many of them, and a cloſe skirmiſh followed.

The skirmiſh being over, they gathered their Priſoners to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and found the number that they had killed and taken was 173 (the Priſoners which they took over Night included) who after the skirmiſh came to them, as they were ordered.</p>
            <p>Now having no Proviſions, but what they took from the Enemy, they haſtened to <hi>Bridgwater,</hi> ſending an expreſs before to provide for them, their Company being now very numerous.

            <p>Capt. <hi>Church</hi> drove his Priſoners that Night into <hi>Bridgwater</hi> Pound, and ſet his <hi>Indian</hi> Souldiers to guard them.

Now the Enemy finding that place of the <hi>Swamp</hi> which was not Ambuſh'd, many of them made their eſcape in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tracks. The Man that had ſhot down <hi>Philip,</hi> ran with all ſpeed to Capt <hi>Church,</hi> and informed him of his exploit, who commanded him to be Silent about it, &amp; let no man more know it, until they had drove the <hi>Swamp</hi>

Capt. <hi>Church</hi> then ſaid, <hi>That foraſmuch as be bad cauſed many an</hi> Engliſh mans <hi>body to lye unburied and ret above ground, that not me of bis bones ſhould be buried.</hi> And calling his old <hi>Indian</hi> Executioner, bid him behead and quarter him. Accordingly, he came with his Hatchet and ſtood ever him, but before he ſtruck he made a ſmall Speech directing it to <hi>Philip;</hi> and ſaid, <hi>He bad been a very great Man, and bad made many a man afraid of him, but ſo big as be was be would now chop bis Aß for him;</hi> and ſo went to work, and did as he was ordered. <hi>Philip</hi> having one very remarkable hand being much ſcarr'd, occaſioned by the ſplitting of a Piſtol in it formerly.

Capt. <hi>Church</hi> then ordered the old man and his daughter to go down fore moſt with their baskets at their backs, that when <hi>Annawon</hi> ſaw them with their baskets he ſhould not miſtruſt the intregue; Capt. <hi>Church</hi> and his handful of Souldiers crept down alſo under the ſhadow of theſe two and their bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, and the Captain himſelf crept cloſe behind the old man, with his Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet in his hand, and ſtep'd over the young mans head to the Arms, the young <hi>Annawon</hi> diſcovering of him, whip'd his blanket over his head and ſhrunk up in a heap: The old Capt. <hi>Annawon</hi> ſtarted up on his breech, and cryed out <hi>Howoh,</hi> and deſpairing of eſcape throw himſelf back again, and lay ſilent until Capt. <hi>Church</hi> had ſecured all the Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And having ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured that company, he ſent his <hi>Indian</hi> Souldiers to the other fires &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, giving them inſtructions, what to do and ſay. Accordingly, they went into the midſt of them: When they diſcovered themſelves who they were, told them that their Capt. <hi>Annawon</hi> was taken, and it would be beſt for them quietly and peaceably to ſurrender themſelves, which would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure good quarter for them: Otherwiſe if they ſhould pretend to reſiſt or make their eſcape, it would be in vain, and they could expect no other but that Capt. <hi>Church</hi> with his great Army, who had now entrap'd them, would cut them to pieces: told them alſo if they would ſubmit themſelves, and deliver up all their Arms unto them, and keep every man his place un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it was day; they would aſſure them that their Capt. <hi>Church</hi> who had been ſo kind to themſelves when they ſurrendred to him, ſhould be as kind unto them. Now they being old acquaintance, and many of them Relations did much the readier give heed to what they ſaid, and complyed &amp; ſurrendred up their Arms unto them, both their Guns and Hatchets <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and were forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with carryed to Capt. <hi>Church.</hi> Things being ſo far ſettled, Capt. <hi>Church</hi> asked <hi>Annawon,</hi> What he had for Supper, for (ſaid he) I am come to Sup
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:001800_0054_0FB82D11CD624118"/>with you. <hi>Tanbut</hi> (ſaid <hi>Annawon</hi>) with a big voices, and looking about upon his Women, bid them haſten and get Capt. <hi>Church</hi> and his company ſome Supper; then turned to Capt. <hi>Church</hi> and asked him, Whether he would eat Cow-beaf or Horſe beaf. The Captain told him Cow-beaf would be moſt acceptable: It was ſoon got ready, and pulling his little bag of Salt out of his Pocket, which was all the Proviſion he brought with him; this ſeaſon'd his Cow beaf ſo that with it and the dry'd green-corn, which the old Squaw was pounding in the Mortar, while they were ſliding down the Rocks, he made a very hearty Supper. And this pounding in the Mortar proved lucky for Capt. <hi>Churches</hi> getting down the Rocks, for when the old Squaw pounded they moved, and when ſhe ceaſed to turn the corn, they ceaſed creeping, the noiſe of the Mortar prevented the Enemies hearing their creeping: and the corn being now dreſſed ſupplyed the want of Bread, and gave a fine reliſh with the Cow-beaf. Supper being over, Capt. <hi>Church</hi> ſent two of his men to inform the other companies, that he had killed <hi>Philip,</hi> and had taken their friends in <hi>Mount-hope</hi> Neck, but had ſpared their lives, and that he had ſubdued now all the Enemy (he ſuppoſed) excepting this company of <hi>Annawons,</hi> and now if they would be orderly and keep their places until Morning, they ſhould have good quarter, and that he would carry them to <hi>Taunton,</hi> where they might ſee their friends again, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Meſſengers return'd, that the <hi>Indians</hi> yielded to his propoſals. Capt. <hi>Church</hi> tho't it was now time for him to take a Nap, having had no ſleep in two days and one night before; told his men that if they would let him ſleep two hours, they ſhould ſleep all the reft of the night. He lay'd himſelf down and endeavoured to ſleep, but all diſpoſition to ſleep departed from him. After he had lain a little while he looked up to ſee how his Watch managed, but found them all faſt a-ſleep. Now Capt. <hi>Church</hi> had told Capt, <hi>Annawons</hi> company as he had ordered his <hi>Indians</hi> to tell the others, that their lives ſhould all be ſpared, excepting Capt. <hi>Annawons,</hi> and it was not in his power to promiſe him his life, but he muſt carry him to his Maſters at <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> and he would intreat them for his life. Now when Capt. <hi>Church</hi> found not only his own men, but all the <hi>Indians</hi> faſt a-ſleep <hi>Annawon</hi> only excepted, whom he perceived was as broad awake as himſelf; and ſo they lay looking one upon the other perhaps an hour; Capt. <hi>Church</hi> ſaid nothing to him, for he could not ſpeak <hi>Indian,</hi> and tho't <hi>Annawon</hi> could not ſpeak <hi>Engliſh;</hi> at length <hi>Annawon</hi> raiſed himſelf up, caſt off his blanket, and with no more clothes than his ſmall breeches, walked a little way back from the company: Capt. <hi>Church</hi> tho't no other but that he had occaſion to eaſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſo walked to ſome diſtance rather than offend him with the ſtink: but by and by he was gone out of ſight and hearing; and then Capt. <hi>Church</hi> began to ſuſpect ſome ill deſign in him, and got all the Guns cloſe him, and crouded himſelf cloſe under young <hi>Annawon,</hi> that if he ſhould any where

               </gap> him without indangering his Son; lying very ſtill a while waiting for the event: at length, he heard ſome body, coming the ſame way that <hi>Annawon</hi> went. The Moon now ſhining bright, he ſaw him at a diſtance coming with ſomething in his hands, and coming up to Capt. <hi>Church,</hi> he fell upon his knees before him, and offer'd him what he had bro't, and ſpeaking in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Great Captain, you have killed</hi> Philip, <hi>and conquered his Country for I believe, that I &amp; my company are the laſt that War againſt the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>ſo ſuppoſe the War is ended by your means; and therefore theſe things belong unto you.</hi> Then opening his pack, he pull'd out <hi>Philip:</hi> belt curiouſly wrought with <hi>Wompom,</hi> being Nine inches broad, wrought with black and white <hi>Wompom,</hi> in various figures and flowers, and pictures of many birds and beaſts. This when hung upon Capt. <hi>Churches</hi> ſhoulders it reach'd his ancles. And another belt of <hi>Wompom</hi> he preſented him with, wrought after the former manner, which <hi>Philip</hi> was wont to put upon his head; it had two flags on the back part which hung down on his back: and another ſmall belt with a Star upon the end of it, which he uſed to hang on his breaſt; and they were all edg'd with red hair, which <hi>Annawon</hi> ſaid they got in the Muhhogs Country. Then he pulled out two horns of glazed Powder, and a red cloth Blanket: he told Capt. <hi>Church,</hi> theſe were <hi>Philips</hi> Royalties which he was wont to adorn himſelf with when he ſat in State. That the tho't himſelf happy that he had an opportunity to preſent them to Capt. <hi>Church,</hi> who had won them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſpent the remainder of the night in diſcourſe; and gave an account of what mighty ſucceſs he had formerly in Wars againſt many Nations of <hi>Indians,</hi> when ſerved <hi>Aſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They went into <hi>Taunton,</hi> were civily and kindly treated by the Inhabitants, refreſhed and refted themſelves that night. Early next Morning, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain took old <hi>Annawon,</hi> and half a dozen of his <hi>Indian</hi> Souldiers, and his own man, and went to <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> ſending the reft of his Company and his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners by his Lieutenant to <hi>Plymouth.</hi> Tarrying two or three days upon the Iſland, he then went to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and carryed his Wife and his two Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with him.</p>
            <p>Capt. <hi>Church</hi> had been but a little while at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> before he was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of a parcel of <hi>Indians,</hi> that haunted the Woods between <hi>Plymouth</hi> and <hi>Sippican</hi> that did great damage to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in killing their Cattel, Horſes, and Swine; and the Captain was ſoon in purſuit of them: Went out from <hi>Plymouth</hi> the next Monday in the afternoon; next Morning early they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a Track; the Captain ſent two <hi>Indians</hi> on the Track to ſee what they could diſcover, while he and his Company followed gently after, but
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:001800_0056_0FB82D14F66E4F98"/>the two <hi>Indians</hi> ſoon returned with Tydings that they had diſcovered the Enemy ſitting round their fires, in a thick place of bruſh. When they came pretty near the place, the Captain ordered every man to creep as he did; and ſurround them by creeping as near as they could, till they ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and then to run on upon them and take them alive, if poſſible, (for their Priſoners were their pay:) They did ſo, took every one that was at the fires, not one eſcaping. Upon examination they agreed in their Story, that they belonged to <hi>Tiſpaquin,</hi> who was gone with <hi>John Bump,</hi> and one more, to <hi>Agawom</hi> and <hi>Sippican</hi> to kill Horſes, and were not expected back in two or three days. This ſame <hi>Tiſpaquin</hi> had been a great Captain, and the <hi>Indians</hi> reported that he was ſuch a great <hi>Pouwau,</hi> that no bullet could enter him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Capt. <hi>Church</hi> ſaid, He would not have him killed, for there was a War broke out in the Eaſtern Part of the Country, and he would have him ſaved to go with them to fight the <hi>Eaſtern Indians.</hi> Agreeably he left two old Squaws of the Priſoners, and bid them tarry there until their Capt. <hi>Tiſpaquin</hi> returned, and to tell him, that <hi>Church</hi> had been there, and had taken his Wife, Children, and company, and carryed them down to <hi>Plymouth;</hi> and would ſpare all their lives, and his too, if he would come down to them and bring the other two that were with him, and they ſhould be his Souldiers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Capt. <hi>Church</hi> then returned to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> leaving the old Squaws well provided for, and Bisket for <hi>Tiſpaquin</hi> when he returned: Telling his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that he doubted not but he had laid a Trap that would take him Capt. <hi>Church</hi> two days after went to <hi>Boſton;</hi> (the Commiſſioners then ſitting) and waited upon the Honourable Governour <hi>Leverett,</hi> who then lay Sick; who requeſted of Capt. <hi>Church</hi> to give him ſome account of the War: who readily obliged his Honour therein, to his great Satisfaction, as he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to expreſs himſelf; taking him by the hand, and telling him, if it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God he lived, he would make it a brace of a hundred pounds advantage to him out of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> Colony, and would endeavour the reft of the Colonies ſhould do Proportionably; but he dyed within a Fortnight af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſo nothing was done of that nature. The ſame day <hi>Tiſpaquin</hi> came in and thoſe that were with him, but when Capt. <hi>Church</hi> return'd from <hi>Boſton,</hi> he found to his grief that the heads of <hi>Annawon, Tiſpaquin, &amp;c.</hi> cut off, which were the laſt of <hi>Philips</hi> friends. The General Court of <hi>Plymouth</hi> then ſitting ſent for Capt. <hi>Church</hi> who waited upon them accordingly, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their Thanks for his good Service, which they Unanimouſly Voted, which was all that Capt. <hi>Church</hi> had for his aforeſaid Service.</p>

He being in Town, juſt going to Breakfaſt, there was an Alarm, ſo he ordered all the Souldiers in the Town to Move away as faſt as they could, where the firing was; and he with what Men more were with him of his Souldiers, Mov'd immediately, and meeting with Capt. <hi>Brackits</hi> Sons, who told him their Father was taken, and that they ſaw a great Army of <hi>Indians</hi> in their Fathers Orchard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By this time our <hi>Indians</hi> that wanted bags and horns were fitted, but wanted more Ammunition: preſently came a Meſſenger to him from the Town &amp; inform'd him, That they had knock'd out the heads of ſeveral Casks of Bullets and they were all too big, being Musket Bullets, and would not fit their Guns, and that if he did not go back himſelf a great part of the Army would be kept back from Service for want of ſuitable Bullets: He run back and ordered every Veſſel to ſend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore all their Casks of Bullets; being brought, knock'd out their heads, and turn'd them all out upon the green by the Fort, and ſet all the People in the Town that were able to make ſlugs; being moſt of them too large for their uſe, which had like to have been the over-throw of their whole Army: He finding ſome ſmall Bullets and what ſlugs were made, and three Snap-ſacks of Powder, went immediately to the Army, who were very hotly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd;
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:001800_0065_0FB82D28E2851CC8"/>but coming to the River, the Tide was up; he call'd to his men that were ingag'd, incouraging them, and told them he had brought more Ammunition for them. An <hi>Indian</hi> call'd Capt. <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> laid down his Gun, and came over the River, taking the Powder upon his head and a Kittle of Bullets in each hand, and got ſafe to his Fellow Souldiers: He pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving great firing upon that ſide he was of, went to ſee who they were, and found them to be two of Maj <hi>Church</hi>'s Companies, one of <hi>Engliſh</hi> &amp; the other of <hi>Indians,</hi> being in all about Fourſcore Men, that had not got over the River, but lay firing over our Mens heads at the Enemy; he preſently or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them to Rally and come all together; and gave the word for a <hi>Caſco</hi> Man: So one <hi>Swarton</hi> a <hi>Jerſey</hi> man appearing, who he could hardly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; he ask'd him, How far it was to the head of the River? or whether there was any place they could get over? He ſaid, there was a Bridge about three quarters of a Mile up where they might get over: So he calling to his Souldiers ingag'd on the other ſide, that he would ſoon be with them over the Bridge, and come upon the backs of the Enemy; which put, new courage into them; ſo they immediately Mov'd up towards the Bridge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Marching very thin, being willing to make what ſhow they could, ſhouting as they March'd: they ſaw the Enemy running from the River-ſide, where they had made Stands with Wood to prevent any body from coming over the River; and coming to the Bridge, they ſaw on the other ſide that the Enemy had laid logs and ſtuck birch bruſh along to hide themſelves from our view. He ordered the Company to come all together, ordering them all to run after him, who would go firſt, and that as ſoon as they got over the Bridge to ſcatter, that ſo they might not be all ſhot down together, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the Enemy to be at their Stands; ſo running up to the Stands, found none there, but were juſt gone, the ground being much tumbled with them behind the ſaid Stands: He order'd the Captain with his Company of <hi>Engliſh</hi> to March down to our Men ingag'd, and that they ſhould keep along upon the edge of the Marſh, and himſelf with his <hi>Indian</hi> Souldiers would March down thro' the bruſh: and coming to a parcel of low ground which had been formerly burnt, the old bruſh being fallen down lay very thick, and young bruſh being grown up made it bad travelling; but coming near the back of the Enemy, one of his Men call'd unto him their Commander, and ſaid, That the Enemy run <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The men being moſt of them out (our Ammunition lay expos'd) coming to the Bridge where he had left Six <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> for an Amboſcade on the other ſide of the River, that if any Enemy effec'd to come over they ſhould fire at them, which would give him Notice,
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:001800_0066_0FB82D2AAC9CF5A0"/>ſo would come to their aſſiſtance; (but in the way having heard no firing nor ſhouting, concluded the Enemy were drawn off) he asked the Amboſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade, whether they ſaw any <hi>Indians?</hi> They ſaid, Yes, abundance. He ask'd them, Where? They anſwered, That they ran over the head of the River by the Cedar Swamp, and were running into the Neck towards the Town: There being but one <hi>Engliſh</hi> man with him, he bid his <hi>Indian</hi> Souldiers ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, run very thin to preſerve themſelves and the better able to make a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the Enemy: &amp; ſoon coming to Lieut. <hi>Clarks</hi> field on the South ſide of the Neck, and ſeeing the Cattel feeding quietly, and perceiving no Track, concluded the Amboſcade had told them a falſehood; they haſtily return'd back to the ſaid Bridge, perceiving there was no noiſe of the Enemy. He hearing ſeveral great Guns fire at the Town, concluded that they were either aſſaulted or that they had diſcover'd the Enemy: He having ordered that in caſe ſuch ſhould be, that they ſhould fire ſome of their great Guns to give him notice; he being a Stranger to the Country, concluded the Enemy had by ſome other way got to the Town: whereupon he ſent his Men to the Town, and himſelf going to the River, near where the fight had been; ask'd them how they did? and what was become of the Enemy? who inform'd him that the Enemy drew off in leſs than an hour after he left them, and had not fired a Gun at them ſince. He told them he had been within little more than a Gun ſhot of the back of the Enemy, and had been upon them had it not been for the thick bruſhy ground, &amp;c. Now ſome of his Men returning from the Town gave him the account, that they went while they ſaw the Colours ſtanding &amp; Men walking about as not moleſted. He preſently ordered that all his Army ſhould purſue the Enemy: But they told him that moſt of them had ſpent their Ammunition, and that if the Enemy had engaged them a little longer they might have come &amp; knock'd them on the head; and that ſome of their Bullets were ſo unſizeable that ſome of them were forc'd to make ſlugs while they were ingag'd. He then order'd them to get over all the wounded and dead men, and to leave none behind: which was done by ſome Canoo's they had got. Capt. <hi>Hall</hi> and his men being firſt ingaged did great Service, and ſuffered the greateſt loſs in his Men. But Capt. <hi>Southworth</hi> with his Company, &amp; Capt. <hi>Numpoſh</hi> with the <hi>Seconis Indians,</hi> and the moſt of the men belonging to the Town all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſuddenly to his relief, prevented him and his whole Company from being cut off, &amp;c. By this time the day was far ſpent, and Marching into Town about Sun-ſet, carrying in all their wounded and dead men; being all ſenſible of Gods goodneſs to them, in giving them the Victory, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Enemy to fly with ſhame, who never gave one ſhout at their draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off. The poor Inhabitants wonderfully rejoyced that the Almighty had favoured them ſo much: ſaying, That if Maj. <hi>Church</hi> with his Forces had not come at that juncture of time, they had been all cut off; and ſaid fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:001800_0067_0FB82D304E9F83D8"/>That it was the firſt time that ever the <hi>Eaſtward Indians</hi> had been put to flight, and the ſaid <hi>Church</hi> with his Volunteers were wonderfully preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, having never a man kill'd out right, and but one <hi>Indian</hi> mortally wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who dy'd, ſeveral more being badly wounded, but recovered.</p>

The poor People the Inhabitants of <hi>Caſco</hi> and Places Adjacent, when they ſaw he was going away from them, lamented ſadly, &amp; beg'd earneſtly that he would ſuffer them to come away in the Tranſports; ſaying if he left them there, that in the Spring of the Year the Enemy would come and deſtroy 'em and their Families, &amp;c. So by their earneſt requeſt the ſaid Maj. <hi>Church</hi> promiſed them, that if the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments that had now ſent him, would ſend him the next Spring, he would certainly come with his Volunteers and <hi>Indians</hi> to their relief: And that as ſoon as he had been at home, and taken a little care of his own buſineſs, he would certainly wait upon the Gentlemen of <hi>Boſton,</hi> and inform them of the Promiſe he had made to them; and if they did not ſee cauſe to ſend 'em relief, to intreat their Honours ſeaſonably to draw them off, that they might not be a prey to the barbarous Enemy. Taking his leave of thoſe poor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants ſome of the chief men there waited upon him to <hi>Black Point,</hi> to Capt <hi>Scottaways</hi> Gartiſon; coming there they prevail'd with the ſaid Capt. <hi>Scottaway</hi> to go with him to <hi>Boſton,</hi> which he readily comply'd with, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the ſaid <hi>Church</hi> would put another in to Command the Garriſon; which being done and taking their leaves one of another, they ſet out and travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thro' all the Country home to <hi>Boſton:</hi> (having imploy'd himſelf to the utmoſt to fulfill his Inſtructions laſt received from <hi>Boſton</hi> Gentlemen, which coſt him about a Months Service more and above what he had pay from <hi>Plymouth</hi> Gentlemen) and in his travel homeward ſeveral Gentlemen wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the ſaid Maj <hi>Church</hi> who was oblig'd to bare their Expences. When he came to <hi>Boſton</hi> Gentlemen, he inform'd them of the miſeries thoſe poor People were in by having their Proviſions taken from them by order of the Preſident, &amp;c.

Coming to <hi>Charleſtown,</hi> ſeveral of his Friends in <hi>Boſton</hi> came over to ſee him; and the next day after the ſaid <hi>Church</hi> came there, Maj. <hi>Walley</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="unknown:001800_0070_0FB82D371FEF2008"/>came to him, and inform'd him, That the Governour and Council wanted to ſpeak with him: He anſwered him, That he had promis'd his Wife and Family not to go into <hi>Boſton;</hi> ſaying, If they had any buſineſs, they could Write to him, and that he would ſend them his anſwer. Soon after came over two other Gentlemen with a Meſſage, that the Governour &amp; Council wanted to have ſome diſcourſe with him. The anſwer return'd was, That he intended to lodge that Night at the <hi>Gray-bound,</hi> in <hi>Roxbury,</hi> and that in the Morning would come to <hi>Pollards</hi> at the South End of <hi>Boſton;</hi> which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he did: ſoon after he came thither received a Letter from the Honourable Capt. <hi>Sewall,</hi> to requeſt him to come to the Council; the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer he return'd by the bearer was, That he thought there was no need of his hazarding himſelf ſo much as to come &amp; ſpeak with them; not that he was afraid of his Life, but becauſe he had no mind to be concern'd any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by reaſon they would not hearken to him about the poor People of <hi>Caſco.</hi> But immediately came Mr. <hi>Maxfield</hi> to him, ſaying, That the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil bid him tell the ſaid <hi>Church,</hi> That if he would take his Horſe and ride along the middle of the Street there might be no danger, they were then ſitting in Council: He bid him go and tell his Maſters. Not to trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whether he came upon his head or feet, he was coming: however thinking the return was ſomething rude, call'd him back to drink a Glaſs of Wine, and then he would go with him. So coming to the Council, They were very thankful to him for his coming; and told him that the occaſion of their ſending for him was, That there was a Captive come in who gave them an account. That the <hi>Indians</hi> were come down and had taken poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Stone Fort at <hi>Pejepſcot,</hi> ſo that they wanted his advice &amp; thoughts about the matter; whither they would tarry and keep in that Fort or not? and whither it was not expedient to ſend ſome Forces to do ſome ſpoil up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; and further to know whither he could not be prevail'd with to Raiſe ſome Volunteers and go, to do ſome ſpoil upon them? He anſwer'd them, he was unwilling to be concern'd any more; it being very difficult and chargeable to Raiſe Volunteers, as he found by experience in the laſt Expedition. But they uſing many arguments prevail'd ſo far with him, That if the Government of <hi>Plymouth</hi> ſaw cauſe to ſend him (he would go) think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Expedition would be ſhort.

They ſaid in thoſe little Hutts that the Enemy had made when they took that Garriſon. The Major told them they muſt not make any fires, for if they did the Enemy would be upon them before day.

Having given them their directions, he with Capt. <hi>Converſe</hi> went on board the <hi>Mary Sloop;</hi> deſigning to Write home, and ſend away in the Morning the two Sloops which had the Small Pox on board, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But before day our <hi>Indians</hi> began to make fires and to Sing and Dance; ſo the Major call'd to Capt. <hi>Southworth</hi> to go a-ſhore &amp; look after his Men, for the Enemy would be upon them by'nd by.

So preſently they did fire upon our Men; but the Morning being miſty their Guns did not go off quick, ſo that our Men had all time to fall down before their Guns went off, and ſaved themſelves from that Volley, except one man, who was kill'd. This ſudden firing upon our <hi>Indian</hi> Souldiers ſurprized them that they left their Arms, but ſoon recover'd them again, and got down the bank which was but low: The Major with all the Forces on board landed as faſt as they could; the Enemy firing ſmartly at them; however all got ſafe a-ſhore. The Enemy had a great advantage of our Forces, who were between the Sun riſing &amp; the Enemy, ſo that if a man put up his head or hand they could ſee it, and would fire at it: However ſome with the Major got up the bank behind ſtumps and rocks, to have the advantage of firing at the Enemy; but when the Sun was riſen the Major ſlip'd down the bank again where all the Forces were order'd to obſerve his Motion, <hi>viz.</hi> That he would give three ſhouts and then all of them ſhould run with him up the bank: ſo when he had given the third ſhout, ran up the bank, and Capt. <hi>Converſe</hi> with him, but when the ſaid <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe</hi> perceived that the Forces did not follow as commanded, call'd to the Major and told him the Forces did not follow; who notwithſtanding the Enemy fired ſmartly at, yet got ſafe down the bank again, and Rallying the Forces up the bank, ſoon put the Enemy to flight; and following them ſo cloſe, that they took 13 Canoo's, and one Luſty Man, who had <hi>Joſeph Ramſdle's</hi> Scalp by his ſide, who was taken by two of our <hi>Indians,</hi> and having his deſerts was himſelf Scalp'd. This being a ſhort and ſmart fight, ſome of our Men were kill'd, and ſeveral wounded. Some time after an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man who was Priſoner amongſt them, gave an account that our Forces had kill'd and wounded ſeveral of the Enemy, for they kill'd ſeveral Priſoners accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Cuſtom <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After this action was over our Force: imbark'd for <hi>Piſcataqua,</hi> and the Major went to <hi>Wells,</hi> and remov'd the Captain there, and put in Capt. <hi>Andras,</hi> who had been with him and knew the Diſcourſe left with the two old Squaws at <hi>Ameras-cogen,</hi> for <hi>Hakins</hi> &amp; <hi>Worumbo</hi> to come there in 14 days, if they had a mind to hear of their Wives &amp; Children: Who did then or ſoon after come with a Flag of Truce to ſaid <hi>Wells</hi> Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and had leave to come in, and more appearing came in, to the number of Eight, (without any terms) being all Chief Sachems; and was very glad to hear of the Women and Children, <hi>viz.

Then he told them that the People in ſaid Houſe have all had the Small Pox, and was recovered; and that if they went in they muſt not come out till they all had it: Whereupon they all preſently began to grow bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to make excuſes except one Man who deſired to ſtay out till Night before he went in, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Major going to the Gentlemen, told them, That one thing more would work a perfect cure upon his Men, which was to let them go home: Which did work a cure upon all, except one, and he had not the Small Pox. So he ordered the Plunder ſhould be divided forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and ſent away all the <hi>Plymouth</hi> Forces. But the Gentlemen there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to ſtay and they would be aſſiſting to him in raiſing new Forces to the number of what was ſent away; and that they would ſend to <hi>Boſton</hi> for Proviſions: which they did, and ſent Capt <hi>Plaiſted</hi> to the Governour and Council at <hi>Boſton, &amp;c.</hi> And in the mean time the Major with thoſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen went into all thoſe Parts and raiſed a ſufficient number of Men, both Officers &amp; Souldiers; who all met at the bank on the ſame day that Capt. <hi>Plaiſted</hi> return'd from <hi>Boſton;</hi> whoſe return from <hi>Boſton</hi> Gentlemen was, That the <hi>Canada</hi> Expedition had dreen'd them ſo that they could do no more: So that Maj. <hi>Church</hi> notwithſtanding he had been at conſiderable Expences in raiſing ſaid Forces to Serve his King and Country was oblig'd to give them a Treat and diſmiſs them: Taking his leave of them came home to <hi>Boſton</hi> in the <hi>Mary Sloop</hi> Mr. <hi>Alden</hi> Maſter, and Capt. <hi>Converſe</hi> with him, of a Saturday; and waiting upon the Governour, and ſome of the Gentlemen in <hi>Boſton,</hi> they look'd very ſtrange upon them, which not only troubled them but put them into ſome conſternation what the matter ſhould be, that after ſo much toyl &amp; hard Service could not have ſo much as one pleaſant word, nor no Money in their Pockets; for Maj <hi>Church</hi> had but <hi>Eight Pence</hi> left, and Capt. <hi>Converſe</hi> none, as he ſaid afterwards. Maj. <hi>Church</hi> ſeeing two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men which he knew had Money, ask'd them to lend him <hi>Forty Shillings,</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them his neceſſity: Yet they reſuſed.

                     <p>ACcording to my promiſe when with you laſt, I waited upon the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernent at <hi>Boſton</hi> upon the Saturday, Capt. <hi>Converſe</hi> being with me. The Governour informed us that the Council was to meet on the Monday following in the afternoon, at which time we both there waited upon them, and gave them an account of the State of your Country, and great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities. They informed us, that their General Court was to Convene on the Wedneſday following; at which time they would debate &amp; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the matter; my ſelf being bound home, Capt. <hi>Converſe</hi> was ordered to wait upon them, and bring you their reſolves. I then took notice of the Council that they look'd upon me with an ill aſpect, not judging me worthy to receive thanks for the Service I had done in your parts; nor as much as ask me whether I wanted Money to bare my Expence, or a Horſe to carry me home. But I was forc'd for want of Money (being far from friends) to go to <hi>Roxbury</hi> on foot; but meeting there with a <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> Gentleman, acquainted him of my wants, who tendered me <hi>en Pounds,</hi> whereby I was accommodated for my Journey home: And being come home, I went to the Miniſter of our Town, and gave him an account of the tranſactions of the great affairs I had been imploy'd in, and of the great
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:001800_0081_0FB82D55A5054F68"/>favour God was pleaſed to ſhew me, and my Company, and the benefit I hoped would accrue to your ſelves; and deſired him to Return Publick Thanks: but at the ſame interim of time a Paper was preſented unto him from a Court of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> which was holded before I came home, to Command a day of Humiliation thro' the whole Government, becauſe of the frowns of God upon thoſe Forces ſent under my Command, and the ill ſucceſs we had, for want of good conduct. All which was cauſed by thoſe falſe Reports which were poſted home by thoſe ill affected Officers that were under my Conduct; eſpecially one which your ſelves very well know, who had the advantage of being at home a Week before me, being ſick of Action, and wanting the advantage to be at the Bank, which he every day was mindful of more than fighting the Enemy in their own Country. After I came home, being inform'd of a General Court at <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> and not forgetting my faithful Promiſe to you, and the duty I lay under, I went thither, where waiting upon them, I gave them an account of my Eaſtward tranſactions, and made them ſenſible of the falſeneſs of thoſe reports that were poſted to them by ill hands, and found ſome ſmall favourable acceptance with them, ſo far that I was credited. I preſented your Thanks to them for their ſeaſonable ſending thoſe Forces to relieve you, with that expence and charge they had been at; which Thanks they gratefully received; and ſaid a few Lines from your ſelves would have been well accepted. I then gave them an account of your great neceſſities by being impriſoned in your Garriſons, and the great miſchief that would attend the Publick concerns of this Country by the loſs of their Majeſty's Intereſt, and ſo much good Eſtate of yours &amp; your Neighbours; as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs would be on the deſerting of your Town. I then moved for a free Contribution for your relief, which they with great forwardneſs promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and then ordered a day of Thanksgiving thro' the Government up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the 26th. day of this Inſtant. Upon which day a Collection was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered for your relief (and the Places near Adjacent) in every reſpective Town in this Government; and for the good management of it that it might be ſafely convey'd unto your hands, they appointed a Man in each County for the reception &amp; conveyance thereof. The perſons nominated and accepted thereof, are: For the County of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> Capt. <hi>Nathanael Thomas</hi> of <hi>Marſhfield:</hi> For the County of <hi>Barnſtable,</hi> Capt. <hi>Joſeph Lathrop</hi> of <hi>Barnſtable:</hi> And for the County of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> my ſelf. Which when gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you will have a particular account from each perſon, with orders of advice how it may be diſpoſed of for your beſt advantage, with a Copy of the Courts order.

As for what I am accuſed of, you all can witneſs to the contrary, and I ſhould take it very kindly from you to do me that juſt right, as to vindicate my Reputation; for the wiſe man ſays, <hi>A good Name is as precious Oyntment.</hi> When I hear of the effect of the Treaty, and have an account

               <p>Then the Major and his Forces embark'd and made the beſt of their way to <hi>Penobſcot;</hi> and coming to an Iſland in thoſe Parts in the evening, landed his Forces at one end of the ſaid Iſland: Then the Major took part of his Forces and mov'd toward Day to the other end of the ſaid Iſland, where they found two <hi>French Men,</hi> and their Families in their houſes; and that one or both of them had <hi>Indian</hi> Women to their Wives, and had Children by them. The Major preſently examining the <hi>French men,</hi> Where the <hi>Indians</hi> were? They told him, That there was a great company of them upon an Iſland juſt by: and ſhowing him the Iſland, preſently diſcover'd ſeveral of them. Maj. <hi>Church</hi> and his Forces ſtill keeping undiſcover'd to them, ask'd the <hi>French men</hi> where their paſſing Place was? Which they readily ſhew'd him; ſo preſently placed an Ambaſcade to take any that ſhould come over. Then ſent orders for all the reſt of the Forces to come; ſending them an account what he had ſeen &amp; met withal; ſtrickly charging them to keep themſelves undiſcovered by the Enemy. The Ambaſcade did not lye long before an <hi>Indian</hi> Man and a Woman came over in a Canoo to the Place for landing, where the Ambaſcade was laid: who haul'd up their Canoo, and came right into the hands of our Ambaſcade, who ſo ſuddenly ſurprized them that they could not give any notice to the others from whence they came; the Major ordering that none of his ſhould offer to meddle with the Canoo, leſt they ſhould be diſcovered, hoping to take the moſt of them if his Forces came as order'd, he expecting them to come as directed. But the firſt news he had of them was, That they were all coming, tho' not privately
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:001800_0088_0FB82D672830D950"/>as ordered; but in the Veſſels fair in ſight of the Enemy, which ſoon put them all to flight: and our Forces not having Boats ſuitable to purſue them, they got all away in their Canoo's, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which cauſed Maj <hi>Church</hi> to ſay, He would never go out again without ſufficient number of Whale-boats) which for want of, was the ruine of that action. Then Maj. <hi>Church</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Inſtructions rang'd all thoſe parts to find all their Corn, and carried aboard their Veſſels what he thought convenient, and deſtroy'd the reſt.

But in the mean time Maj. <hi>Church</hi> and his Forces being ready, imbark'd, and on the 15th day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> ſet Sail for <hi>Piſcataqua,</hi> where more Men were to joyn them (but before they leſt <hi>Boſton,</hi> Maj <hi>Church</hi> diſcours'd with the Captain of the Man of War, who promiſed him, if he went to Mount-<hi>Deſart</hi> in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of the ſaid French Ship, that he would call for him and his Forces at <hi>Piſcataqua,</hi> expecting that the <hi>French &amp; Indians</hi> might not be far from the ſaid French Ship, ſo that he might have an opportunity to fight them while he was ingag'd with the French Ship:) Soon after the Forces arrived at <hi>Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cataqua</hi> the Major ſent his <hi>Indian</hi> Souldiers to Col. <hi>Gidney</hi> at <hi>York,</hi> to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting for the defence of thoſe Places; who gave them a good Commend for their ready &amp; willing Services done, in Scouting, and the like Lying at <hi>Piſcataqua</hi> with the reft of our Forces near a Week, waiting for more For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces who was to joyn them to make up their complement; in all which time heard never a word of the Man of War. On the 22d of <hi>Auguſt</hi> they all imbark'd from <hi>Piſcataqua,</hi> and when they came againſt <hi>York,</hi> the Major went a-ſhore, ſending Capt. <hi>Gorham</hi> with ſome Forces in the two Briganteens and a Sloop to <hi>Winter Harbour,</hi> ordering him to ſend out Scouts to ſee if they could make any diſcovery of the Enemy, and to wait there till he came to them: Maj <hi>Church</hi> coming to <hi>York,</hi> Col. <hi>Gidney</hi> told him his opinion was, That the Enemy was drawn off from thoſe parts, for that the Scouts could not diſcover any of them, nor their Tracks. So having done his buſineſs there, went with what Forces he had there to <hi>Winter Harbour,</hi> where he had the ſame account from Capt. <hi>Gorham,</hi> That they had not diſcovered any of the Enemy, nor any new Tracks: So concluding they were gone from thoſe Parts towards <hi>Penobſcot;</hi> the Major ordered all the Veſſels to come to Sail and make the beft of their way to <hi>Monbegin,</hi> which being not far from <hi>Penobſcot,</hi> where the main body of our Enemies living was; being in great hopes to come up with the Army of <hi>French &amp; Indians,</hi> before they had ſcattered and were gone paſt <hi>Penobſcot</hi> or Mount-<hi>Deſart,</hi> which is the chief place of their

The Forces being all ready in their Boats, rowing very hard, got a-ſhore at a Point near <hi>Penobſcot</hi> juſt as the day broke, and hid their Boats, and keeping a good look out by Sea, and ſent Scouts out by Land; but could not diſcover neither Canoo's nor <hi>Indians;</hi> what Tracks and fire places they ſaw were judg'd to be 7 or 8 days before they came: As ſoon as Night came that they might go undiſcovered got into their Boats and went by <hi>Muſſel-neck,</hi> and ſo amongſt <hi>Penobſcot</hi> Iſlands, looking very ſharp as they went for fires on the ſhore, and for Canoo's, but found neither; getting up to <hi>Mathebeſtucks</hi> hills, day coming on, landed, and hid their Boats; locking out for the Enemy, as the day before, but to little purpoſe. Night coming on to their Oars again, working very hard, turn'd the Night into Day; made ſeveral of their new Souldiers grumble: but telling them they hoped to come up quickly with the Enemy put new life into them; and by day-light they got into the Mouth of the River, where landing, found many Randezvous and fire Places where the <hi>Indians</hi> had been; but at the ſame ſpace of time, as before mentioned. And no Canoo's paſſed up the River that day. Their Pilot <hi>Joſeph York</hi> inform'd the Major that 50 or 60 Miles up that River at the great Falls, the Enemy had a great Randezvous, and planted a great quantity of Corn, when he was a Priſoner with them, four Years a goe, and that he was very well acquainted there; this gave great incouragement to have had ſome conſiderable advantage of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my at that Place; ſo uſing their utmoſt endeavours to get up there undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered: and coming there found no Enemy nor Corn Planted, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving deſerted the Place. And ranging about the Falls on both ſides of the River, leaving Men on the Eaſt ſide of the ſaid River, and the Boats juſt below the Falls, with a good guard to ſecure them, and to take the Enemy if they came down the River in their Canoo's: The weſt ſide being the Place where the Enemy lived and beft to travel on, they reſolved to range as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately as they could, a Mile or two above the Falls, diſcovered a birch Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noo coming down with two <hi>Indians</hi> in it, the Major ſent word immediately back to thoſe at the Falls to lye very cloſe, and let them paſs down the Falls, and to take them alive, that he might have Intelligence where the Enemy was (which would have been a great advantage to them:) But a fooliſh

In the mean time another Canoo with three Men were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming down the River were fired at by ſome of our Forces, ran a-ſhore and left two of their Guns in the Canoo, which were taken, and alſo a Letter from a Prieſt to <hi>Caſteen,</hi> that gave him an account of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning over the Lake to <hi>Mount-Royal,</hi> and of their little Service done upon the <hi>Maquas Indians</hi> weſtward, only demoliſhing one Fort and cutting down ſome Corn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He deſiring to hear of the proceedings of <hi>Deborabuel,</hi> and the French Man of War; and informed him that there were ſeveral Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noo's coming with work men from <hi>Quabeck,</hi> to Saint <hi>John's,</hi> where ſince we concluded it was to build a Fort at the Rivers Mouth, where the great Guns were taken, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It being juſt Night, the Officers were call'd together to adviſe, &amp; their Pilot <hi>York</hi> inform'd them of a Fort up that River, &amp; that it was built on a little Iſland in that River; and that there was no getting to it but in Canoo's, or on the Ice in the Winter time: This with the certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that we were diſcovered by the Enemy that eſcaped out of the upper Canoo, concluded it not proper at that time to proceed any further up, and that there was no getting any further with our Boats; and the Enemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Alarm'd would certainly fly from them (and to do as they did four Years ago at their Fort at <hi>Taconock,</hi> having fought them in <hi>Kanebeck</hi> River, and purſued them about go Miles to <hi>Taconock;</hi> for they then ſet their Fort on fire, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Maj <hi>Church</hi> then incouraging his Souldiers, told them, he hop'd they ſhould meet with part of the Enemy, in <hi>Penobſcot</hi> bay, or at Mount-<hi>Deſart,</hi> where the French Ships were. So notwithſtanding they had been rowing ſeveral Nights before, with much toyl, beſides were ſhort of Proviſions, they chearfully embark'd on board their Boats, and went down the River, both with and againſt the Tide: and next Morning came to their Veſſels, where the Major had ordered them to meet him, who could give him no intelligence of any Enemy. Where being come they refreſh'd themſelves; Meeting then with another diſappointment for their Pilot <hi>York</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="unknown:001800_0094_0FB82D795F77FC08"/>not being acquainted any further, they began to lament the loſs of one <hi>Robert Cawley,</hi> who they chiefly depended on for all the Service to be done now Eaſtward: he having been taken away from them the Night before they ſat Sail from <hi>Boſton</hi> (and was on board Mr. <hi>Thorps</hi> Sloop) and put on board the Man of War, unknown to Maj <hi>Church;</hi> notwithflanding he had been at the charge and trouble of procuring him.

But upon <hi>Penobſcot</hi> Iſland they found ſeveral <hi>Indian</hi> Houſes, Corn &amp;Turnips, tho' the Enemy ſtill being all gone, as before mentioned. Then they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided and ſent their Boats ſome one way and ſome another, thinking that if any ſtraggling <hi>Indians,</hi> or <hi>Caſteen</hi> himſelf ſhould be there about, they might find them, but it prov'd all in vain. Himſelf and ſeveral Boats went to Mount <hi>Deſart,</hi> to ſee if the French Ships were gone and whither any of the Enemy might be there, but to no purpoſe: The Ships being gone and the Enemy alſo. They being now got ſeveral Leagues to the Weſtward of their Veſſels; and ſeeing that the way was clear for their Veſſels to paſs: And all their extream rowing and travelling by Land and Water, Night and Day to be all in vain. The Enemy having left thoſe parts, as they judg'd about eight or ten days before. And then returning to their Veſſels, the Commander calling all his Officers together, to conſult and reſolve what to do, concluding that the Enemy by ſome means or other had received ſome Intelligence of their being come out againſt them; and that they were in no neceſſity to come down to the Sea ſide as yet, Mooſe and Bever now being fat. They then agreed to go ſo far Eaſt, and imploy themſelves that the Enemy belonging to thoſe parts might think they were gone home: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſome diſcourſe about going over to Saint <hi>John's</hi>; but the Maſters of the Veſſels ſaid, he had as good carry them to old <hi>France, &amp;c.</hi> which put off that deſign, they concluding that the French Ships were there. Then the Major mov'd for going over the Bay towards <hi>Lahane,</hi> and toward the Gut of <hi>Cancer,</hi> where was another conſiderable Fort of <hi>Indians,</hi> who often came to the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of our Enemy, the barbarous <hi>Indians;</hi> ſaying that by the time they ſhould return again, the Enemy belonging to theſe parts would be come down again, expecting that we are gone home.

One <hi>Jarman Bridgway</hi> came running to wards our Forces with a Gun in one hand, and his Cartridg-box in the other, calling to our Forces to ſtop that he might ſpeak with them; but Maj. <hi>Church</hi> thinking it was that they might have ſome advantage, ordered them to run on; when the ſaid <hi>Bridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> ſaw they would not ſtop, turn'd and run, but the Major call'd unto him, and bid him ſtop, or he ſhould be ſhot down; ſome of our Forces being near to the ſaid <hi>Bridgway,</hi> ſaid it was the General that call'd to him: he hearing that, ſtop'd and turn'd about, laying down his Gun, ſtood, till the Major came up to him, his deſire was that the Commander would make haſte with him to his houſe, leſt the Salvages ſhould kill his Father and Mother, who were upward of fourſcore Years of Age, and could not go. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor ask'd the ſaid <hi>Bridgway</hi> whither there was any <hi>Indians</hi> amongſt them? and where they liv'd? he ſhak'd his head, and ſaid, he durſt not tell, for if he did they would take an opportunity and kill him and his: ſo all that could be got out of him was, that they were run into the Woods with the reſt. Then orders were given to purſue the Enemy, and to kill what <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> they could find, and take the <hi>French</hi> alive, and give them quarter, if they ask'd it. Our Forces ſoon took three French Men, who upon examination ſaid, That the Indians were all run into the woods. The French firing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Guns at our Forces, and ours at them; but they being better acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the woods than ours, got away. The Major took the above ſaid <hi>Jarman Bridgway</hi> for a Pilot, and with ſome of his Forces went over a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to ſeveral of their houſes, but the People were gone and carryed their goods with them: In ranging the woods found ſeveral Indian-houſes their fires being juſt out but no Indians. Spending that day in ranging to &amp; fro, found conſiderable of their goods, and but few People; at Night the Major writ a Letter, and ſent out two French Priſoners, wherein was ſignifyed, That if they would come in, they ſhould have good quarters.

<pb n="111" facs="unknown:001800_0114_0FB82C43E76192D0"/>were expected from <hi>Port Royal</hi> ſide. In this heat of action, every word that I then ſpoke, I cannot give an account of, and I preſume it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. I ſtop'd but little here, but went directly up into the woods, hoping to be better imployed, with the reſt of the Army, I liſten'd to hear, and looked earneſtly to ſee what might be the next action; but meeting with many of the Souldiers, They told me, they had diſcovered nothing; we fetching a ſmall compaſs round, came down again. It being pretty dark, I took notice, I ſaw two men lay dead as I thought, at the end of the houſe, where the door was, and immediately the Guns went off, and they fired every man as I thought, and moſt towards that place where I left the guard with Monſieur <hi>Gourdan.</hi> I had much ado to ſtop their firing, and told them, I thought they were mad, and I believed they had not killed and wounded leſs than 40 or 50 of our own Men. And I asked them what they ſhot at? They anſwered at a French man that ran away: but to admiration no man was kill'd but he, &amp; one of our own men wounded in the Leg; and I turning about, a French man ſpoke to me, and I gave him quarter. Day-light coming on and no diſcovery made of the Enemy, I went to the place where I had left Monſieur <hi>Gourdan,</hi> to examine him, and his Sons, who agreed in their examinations; told me two of their men were abroad: It prov'd a damage; and further told me, That Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Sharkee</hi> lived ſeveral Leagues up at the head of the River, at the Falls; and all the <hi>Indians</hi> were fiſhing, and tending their Corn there; and that Monſieur <hi>Sharkee</hi> had ſent down to him, to come up to him to adviſe about the <hi>Indian</hi> Army, that was to go Weſtward; but he had returned him anſwer, his buſineſs was urgent, and he could not come up: and that <hi>Sharkee,</hi> and the <hi>Indians,</hi> would certainly be down that day, or the next at the furtheſt, to come to conclude of that matter. This was a ſhort Nights action, and all ſenſible Men do well know, that actions done in the dark (being in the Night as aforeſaid) under ſo many difficulties, as we then laboured under, as before related, was a very hard Task for one Man, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters being circumſtanc'd as in this action; which would not admit of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a Council; and at that time could not be confin'd there-unto; at which time I was tranſported above fear or any ſort of dread; yet being ſenſible of the danger in my Armies crowding ſo thick together, and of the great duty incumbent on me to preſerve them from all the danger I poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly could, for further improvement, in the Deſtruction of our implacable Enemies; am ready to conclude, that I was very quick &amp; abſolute in giving ſuch Commands &amp; Orders, as I then apprehended moſt proper and advantagious. And had it not been for the Intelligence I had received from the <hi>French</hi> we took at <hi>Penobſcot,</hi> as before hinted, and the falſe report the <hi>French</hi> Woman (firſt took) gave me, I had not been in ſuch haſte.

               <p>This Nights Service being over immediately Col. <hi>Church</hi> leaves a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent guard with <hi>Gourdan,</hi> and the other Priſoners, mov'd in ſome Whale-boats with the reſt; and as they were going ſpy'd a ſmall thing upon the Water, at a great diſtance, which proved to be a birch Canoo, with two <hi>Indians</hi> in her; the Colonel preſently ordered the lighteſt boat he had to make the beſt of her way and cut them off from the Shore: but the <hi>Indians</hi> perceiving their deſign run their Canoo a ſhore &amp; fled. Col. <hi>Church</hi> fearing they would run directly to <hi>Sharkee</hi> made all the expedition imaginable; but it being ebb and the water low, was obliged to land &amp; make the beſt of their way thro' the woods, hoping to intercept the <hi>Indians,</hi> and get to <hi>Sharkee's</hi> houſe before them; which was two Miles from where our Forces landed. The Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel being Ancient &amp; Unwildy, deſired Serjeant <hi>Edee</hi> to run with him, and coming to ſeveral Trees fallen, which he could not creep under or readily get over, would lay his breaſt againſt the Tree the ſaid <hi>Edee</hi> turning him over, generally had Cat luck, falling on his feet, by which means kept in the Front: and coming near to <hi>Sharkee's</hi> houſe, diſcovered ſome <hi>French</hi> &amp; <hi>Indians</hi> making a Wair in the River, and preſently diſcovered the two <hi>Indians</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, who call'd to them at work in the River; told them ther was an Army of <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> juſt by; who immediately left their work and ran, endeavouring to get to <hi>Sharkee's</hi> houſe; who hearing the noiſe, took his Lady &amp; Child, and ran into the woods. Our Men running briskly fired &amp; kill'd one of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and took the reſt Priſoners. Then going to <hi>Sharkee's</hi> houſe found a Woman and Child, to whom they gave good quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and finding that Madam <hi>Sharkee</hi> had leſt her Silk Clothes &amp; fine linen behind her, our Forces was deſirous to have purſued and taken her: But Col <hi>Church</hi> fothid them, ſaying he would have her run and ſuffer, that ſhe might be made ſenſible, what hard ſhips our poor People had ſuffered by them, &amp;c. Then proceeded to examine the Priſoners newly taken, who gave
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:001800_0116_0FB82C4694158678"/>him the ſame account he had before; of the <hi>Indians</hi> being up at the Falls, &amp;c. It being juſt Night prevented our Attacking of them that Night. But next Morning early they mov'd up to the Falls (which was about a Mile higher:) But doubtleſs the Enemy had ſome Intelligence by the two afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Indians,</hi> before our Forces came, ſo that they all got on the other ſide of the River and left ſome of their goods by the Water-ſide, to decoy our Men, that ſo they might fire upon them; which indeed they effected: But thro' the good Providence of God never a Man of ours was kill'd; and but one ſlightly wounded. After a ſhort diſpute Col. <hi>Church</hi> ordered that every Man might take what they pleaſed of the Fiſh which lay bundled up, and to burn the reſt, which was a great quantity. The Enemy ſeeing what our Forces were about; and that their ſtock of Fiſh' was deſtroyed, and the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon being over for getting any more, ſet up a hedious Cry, and ſo ran all away into the woods; who being all on the other ſide of the River, ours could not follow them. Having done, our Forces March'd down to their Boats at <hi>Sharkee's,</hi> and took their Priſoners, Bever, and other Plunder which they had got, and put it into their Boats, and went down to <hi>Gourdams</hi> houſe, where they had left Lieut. Col. <hi>Gorbam</hi> &amp; Maj <hi>Hilton,</hi> with part of the Forces to guard the Priſoners; (and kept a good look-out for more of the Enemy) who upon the Colonels return, gave him an account that they had made no diſcovery of the Enemy ſince he left them, &amp;c. Juſt then Her Majefly's Ships and Tranſports arriving. The Commanders of Her Majeſty's Ships told Gol. <hi>Church</hi> that they had orders to go directly for <hi>Port Royal Gut,</hi> and wait the coming of ſome Store-Ships, which were expected at <hi>Port Royal</hi> from <hi>France;</hi> and Col. <hi>Church</hi> adviſing with them, propoſed that it was very expedient and ſerviceable to the Crown, that Capt. <hi>Southack</hi> in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Galley ſhould accompany them, which they did readily acquieſce with him in. Upon which the Colonel immediately embark'd his Forces on board the Tranſports, and himſelf on board Capt. <hi>Jarvis;</hi> ordering the Commiſſary of the Stores, the Miniſter, Surgeons &amp; Pilots all to embark on board the ſame Veſſel with him; ordering all the Whale boats to be put on board the Tranſports, and then all to come to Sail. The Ships ſtanding away for <hi>Port Royal Gut,</hi> and Col, <hi>Church</hi> with the Tranſports for <hi>Menis:</hi> In their way the Colonel inquired of the Pilot—<hi>Fellows,</hi> What depth of Water there was in the Crick near the Town of <hi>Menis?</hi> He anſwered him that there was Water enough near the Town to flote that Veſſel they were in at low Water, So when coming near, Col. <hi>Church</hi> obſerved a Woody Iſland between them and the Town, that they run up on the back-ſide of the ſaid Iſland, with all their Tranſports undiſcovered to the Enemy, and came to Anchor. Then the Colonel and all his Forces embark'd in the Whale boats it being late in the day mov'd directly for the Town, and in the way ask'd for the Pilot, whom he expected was in one of the Boats but he had given him the ſlap and tarried behind.

               <p>Then moving to the Crick expecting to have had Water enough for the Boats, as the Pilot had inform'd them, but found not Water enough for a Canoo; ſo were oblig'd to land, intending to have been up at the Town Before the hour was out, that the Summons expreſſed: (For their return was, That if our Forces would not hurt their Eſtates, that then they would Surrender, if otherwiſe intended, they ſhould fight for them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) But meeting with ſeveral Cricks near 20 or 30 foot deep, which were very Muddy and Dirty, ſo that the Army could not get over them; was oblig'd to return to
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:001800_0118_0FB82C4F20016F88"/>their Boats again, and wait till within Night before the Tide ſerved for them to go up to the Town; and then intended to go up pretty near the Town, and not to fall on till Morning, being in hopes that the banks of the Cricks would ſheker them from the Enemy: but the Tides riſing ſo high expoſed them all to the Enemy; who had the Trees &amp; Woods to be-friend them. And ſo came down in the Night &amp; fired ſmartly at our Forces; but Col. <hi>Church</hi> being in a Pinis that had a ſmall Cannon plac'd in the head, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to be charg'd ſeveral times, with Bullets in ſmall bags, and fired at the Enemy, which made ſuch a rattling amongſt the Trees, that cauſed the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to draw off; and by the great Providence of Almighty God not one of our Forces was hurt that Night; (but as I have been informed they had one <hi>Indian</hi> kill'd, and ſome others wounded, which was ſome diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Enemy.) Next Morning by break of Day, Col. <hi>Church</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered all his Forces, (and plac'd Maj. <hi>Hilton</hi> on the right wing,) to run all up driving the Enemy before them, who leaving their Town to our Forces, but had carried away the beſt of their Goods (which were ſoon found by our Souldiers.) The bulk of the Enemy happening to lye againſt our right Wing cauſed the hotteſt diſpute there, who lay behind Logs and Trees, till our Forces, and Maj. <hi>Hilton</hi> who led them, came on upon them, and forc'd them to run; and notwithſtanding the ſharp firing of the Enemy at our Forces, by the repeated Providence of God there was never a Man of ours kill'd or wounded. Our Souldiers not having been long in Town before they found conſiderable quantities of Strong Drink (both Brandy &amp; Claret) and being very greedy after it, eſpecially the <hi>Indians,</hi> were very diſorderly, firing at every Pig, Turky or Fowl they ſaw, of which were very plenty in the Town; which indanger'd our own Men: Col. <hi>Church</hi> perceiving the diſorder, and firing of his own Men, ran to put a ſtop to it, had ſeveral ſhot come very near him; and finding what had occaſion'd this diſorder, commanded his Officers to knock out the heads of every Cask of Strong Liquor they could find in the Town, to prevent any further diſturbance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his Army; knowing it was impoſſible to have kept it from them, eſpecially the <hi>Indians,</hi> if it was ſaved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then ſome of the Army who were deſirous to purſue the Enemy, having heard them driving away their Cattel, Requeſted the Colonel to let them go; who did: and gave them their orders. Capt. <hi>Cooke,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Church</hi> to lead the two Wings, and Lieut. <hi>Barker</hi> who led the Colonels Company in the Center: and the ſaid Capt. <hi>Cooke</hi> and Capt. <hi>Church</hi> deſired Lieut. <hi>Barker</hi> not to move too faſt; ſo that he might have the benefit of their aſſiſtance, if he had occaſion; but the ſaid Lieutenant not being ſo careful as he ſhould have been, or at leaſt was too eager, was ſhot down, and another Man; which were all the Men that were kill'd in the whole Expedition. Towards Night Col. <hi>Church</hi> ordered ſome of his Forces to pull down ſome of the Houſes, and others to get Logs
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:001800_0119_0FB82C50EA9B2678"/>and make a Fortification for his whole Army to lodge in that Night, that ſo they might be together: and juſt before Night ordered ſome of his Men to go ſee if there were any Men in any of the Houſes in the Town; if not, to ſet them all a fire: which was done, and the whole Town ſeemed to be of a fire all at once, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The next Morning the Colonel gave orders to his Men to dig down their Dams, and let the Tide in to deſtroy all their Corn, and every thing that was good, according to his Inſtructions; and to burn the Fortification which they had built the Day before: And when the Tide ſerv'd to put all their Plunder which they had got into the Boats. Then ordering his Souldiers to March at a good diſtance one from another; which caus'd the Enemy to think that there was not leſs than a thouſand Men (as they ſaid afterwards:) and that their burning of the Fortification, and doing as they did, cauſed the Enemy to think that they were gone clear off and not to return again. But it proved to the contrary, for Col. <hi>Church</hi> and his Forces only went aboard their Tranſports, and there ſtaid till the Tide ſerv'd; in the Night embarked on board their Whale-boats, landed ſome of his Men, expecting they might meet with ſome of the Enemy mending their Dams; which they did, and with the Boats went up another branch of the River, to another Town or Village; upon ſuch a ſurprize took as many Priſoners as they could deſire. And it happened that Col. <hi>Church</hi> was at the French Captains Houſe when two Gentlemen that came Poſt from the Governour of <hi>Port Royal</hi> to him, who was the Chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander at <hi>Menis,</hi> with in Expreſs to ſend away two Companies of Men to Defend the Kings Fort there; and to give him an account, That there was three <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men of War come into <hi>Port Royal Gut</hi> or Harbour; and that the Men ſent for muſt be Poſted away with all ſpeed. Col. <hi>Church,</hi> as was ſaid before, being there, treated the two Gentlemen very hanſomely, and told them, He would ſend them back again Poſt to their Maſter upon his buſineſs; and bid them give him his hearty thanks for ſending him ſuch good News, that part of his Fleet was in ſo good a Harbour. Then reading the Summons to them that he had ſent to <hi>Menis.</hi> Further added, That their Maſter the Governour of <hi>Port Royal</hi> muſt immediately ſend away a Poſt to the Governour of <hi>Canada</hi> at <hi>Quebeck,</hi> to prevent his further ſending any of his cruel &amp; bloudy <hi>French</hi> and Salvages, as he had done lately upon <hi>Deerfield,</hi> where they had committed ſuch horrible and bloudy outrages upon thoſe poor People, that never did them any harm, as is intollerable to think of; and that for the future, if any ſuch Hoſtilities were made upon our Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier Towns, or any of them, He would come out with a thouſand Salvages, and Whale boats convenient, and turn his back upon them, and let his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages Scalp &amp; Roſt the <hi>French;</hi> or at leaſt treat them as their Salvages had treated ours: Alſo gave them an account of part of that action at <hi>Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

The two French Gentlemen that came Poſt made ſolemn Promiſes that they would punctually do the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel's Meſſage to their Governour. So with the deſire of the French People there that the Governour might have this Intelligence, Col. <hi>Church</hi> diſmiſs'd them, and ſent them away; telling the ſame Story to ſeveral of the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and what they muſt expect if ſome ſpeedy courſe was not taken up prevent further outrages upon the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> The number of Priſoners then Preſent (which were conſiderable) did unanimouſly intreat of Col. <hi>Church,</hi> that he would take them under the Protection of the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> making great Promiſes of their fidelity to the ſame, begging with great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony of Spirit to Save their Lives, and to protect them from his Salvages, whom they extreamly dreaded: As to the matter of the Salvages, He told them, It would be juſt Retaliation for him to permit his Salvages to treat the <hi>French</hi> in the ſame manner, as the <hi>French</hi> with their Salvages treated our friends in our Frontier Towns: But as to his taking them under the Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> he utterly refuſed it, urging to them their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Perfidiouſneſs; they alſo urging to him, that it would be impoſſible for any <hi>French</hi> to live any where in the Bay of <hi>Fundy,</hi> if they were not taken under the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government; for with the benefit of thoſe Whale-boats, (as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> called them) they could take and deſtroy all their People in the Town of <hi>Menis</hi> in one Night: But he reply'd to them, It ſhould never be; alledging to them that when they were ſo before, when <hi>Port Royal</hi> was taken laſt by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that it prov'd of very ill conſequence to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> &amp; the Subjects thereof in our Frontiers; for that our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Traders ſupplying them; enabled them (which opportunity they improv'd) to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the <hi>Indians</hi> our bloudy Enemies; and therefore he could make no other Terms of Peace with them than that; if they the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Menis, Signect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Colonel alſo telling them, That if ever hereafter any of our Frontiers Eaſt or Weſt were Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted by them, as formerly, that he would (if God ſpared his Life,) and they might depend upon it, Return upon them with a thouſand of his Salvages, if he wanted them, all Volunteers, with our Whale-boats, and would pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue them to the laſt Extremity.

The Colonel reſolving the next day to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat all his action at <hi>Menis,</hi> and ſo draw off. Accordingly, ſent his orders to Col. <hi>Goreham</hi> and Maj <hi>Hilton,</hi> with all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Companies both Officers and Souldiers, except ſome few, which he thought he might have occaſion for to go with the <hi>Indians</hi> in the Whale-boats up the Eaſtward River, where a third part of the Inhabitants Lived; that ſo he might prevent any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection made on them, in leaving any part of the Service undone. And therefore in the evening ordered all the Whale boats to be laid ready for the Nights Service; and accordingly when the Tide Served, he went with his <hi>Indians</hi> up the River, where they did ſome ſpoil upon the Enemy going up. In the Morning ſeveral of their Tranſports came to meet them, to their great rejoycing, on whom they went on Board, and ſoon came up with the whole Fleet, with whom they joyned, bending their courſe directly towards <hi>Port Royal,</hi> where they were ordered.

Being all ready, the Colonel with his Tranſports &amp; Forces went up the Bay to <hi>Signecto,</hi> where they needed not a Pilot, being ſeveral of them well acquainted there: (and had nor met with ſo many difficulties at <hi>Menis,</hi> had it not been that their Pilot deceiv'd them; who knew nothing of the matter, kept out of the way and Landed not with them, &amp;c.) And coming to <hi>Signecto,</hi> the Enemy were all in Arms ready to receive them, Col. <hi>Church</hi> Landing his Men; the Commander of the Enemy waving his Sword over his head, bid a Challange to them: The Colonel ordering his two Wings to March up a-pace, and come upon the backs of the Enemy, himſelf being in the Center, and the Enemy knowing him, (having been there before) Shot chiefly at him; (but thro' Gods goodneſs received no harm, neither had he one Man kill'd, nor but two ſlightly wounded) and then ran all away into the Woods, and left their Town with nothing in it; having had timely Notice of our Forces, had carryed all away out of the reach of our Army; for Col. <hi>Church</hi> while there with part of his Forces Ranged the Woods, but to no purpoſe: Then returning to the Town, did them what ſpoil he could; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Inſtructions, and ſo drew off, and made the beſt of their way for <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamequado,</hi> (and going in) in a great Fog, one of their Tranſports ran upon a Rock, but was ſoon got off again. Then Col. <hi>Church</hi> with ſome of his Forces embark'd in their Whale-boats, and went amongſt the Iſlands, with an intent to go to <hi>Sharkee's</hi> where they had deſtroyed the Fiſh; but obſerving a Springgy place in a Cove, went on Shore to get ſome Water to drink, it being a Sandy beach, they eſpy'd Tracks, the Colonel preſently ordered his Men to ſcatter, and make a ſearch; ſoon found <hi>De Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſes</hi> Wife, who had formerly been Col. <hi>Church's</hi> Priſoner, and carried to <hi>Boſton;</hi> but returned, who ſeemed to be very glad to ſee him: She had with her two Sons that were near Men grown; the Colonel ordering them a part, Examined the Woman firſt, who gave him this account following, That ſhe had lived there-abouts ever ſince the Fleet went by, and that ſhe had never ſeen but two <hi>Indians</hi> ſince, who came in a Cando from <hi>Norrigiwock;</hi> who ask'd her, what made her to be there alone? She told them; She had not ſeen a <hi>French</hi> Maninor an <hi>Indian</hi> except thoſe two ſince the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships went by. Then the <hi>Indians</hi> told her there was not one <hi>Indian</hi> left except thoſe two, who belong to the Gut of <hi>Cancer,</hi> on this ſide of <hi>Canada:</hi> for the Fryers coming down with the <hi>Indians</hi> to Monſieur <hi>Gordans,</hi> and finding the French-men ſlain, and their Hair ſpoiled, being Scalp'd, put them into a great Conſternation; and the Fryerstold them it was impoſſible for them to live there abouts, for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> with their W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Whereupon they all agreed to go away; which they did, and left their Ruff houſhold-ſtuff, and Corn behind them, and went all, except thoſe two for <hi>Canada.</hi> Alſo her Sons giving the ſame Intelligence, ſo we had no reaſon to think but that it was true. Col. <hi>Church</hi> having done what he could there, Embark'd on board the Tranſports and went to Mount <hi>Deſart,</hi> where he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to have met with the Ships from <hi>Port Royal Gut;</hi> and going into the Harbour at Mount <hi>Deſart,</hi> found no Ships there, but a Runlet rid off by a line in the Harbour, which he ordered to be taken up, and opening of it found a Letter, which gave him an account that the Ships were gone home for <hi>Boſton.</hi> Then he proceeded &amp; went to <hi>Penobſcot;</hi> where being come, made diligent ſearch in thoſe Parts for the Enemy, but could not find or make any diſcovery of them, or that any had been there ſince he left thoſe Parts, which caus'd him to believe what <hi>De Boiſſes</hi> Wife had told him was true. (I will only by the way juſt give a hint of what we heard ſince of the Effects of this Expedition, &amp; then proceed.) [Firſt, That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces that went next to <hi>Norrigiwock</hi> found that the Enemy was gone, &amp; had left their Ruff houſhold-ſtuff and Corn behind them; alſo not long after this Expedition, there were ſeveral Gentlemen ſent down from <hi>Canada</hi> to concert with our Governour about the ſettling of a Cartile for the Exchange of Priſoners; and that the Governour of <hi>Canada</hi> has never ſince ſeet down any Army upon our Frontiers (as I know of) except ſome times a Scout of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> to take ſome Priſoners, that he might be informed of our State, and what we were acting <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and always took care that the Priſoners ſo taken ſhould be Civily Treated, and ſafely Returned, as I have been informed; that ſome of the Priſoners that were taken gave an account; ſo that we have great cauſe to believe that the Meſſage Col. <hi>Church</hi> ſent by the two <hi>French</hi> Gentlemen from <hi>Menis</hi> to the Governour of <hi>Port Royal</hi> took Effect, and was a means to bring Peace in our borders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] Then Col. <hi>Church</hi> with his Forces embark'd on board the Tranſports, and went to <hi>Caſes Bay,</hi> where they met with Capt. <hi>Galop</hi> in a Veſſel from <hi>Boſton,</hi> who had brought Col <hi>Church</hi> further Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; which was to ſend ſome of his Forces up to <hi>Norrigiwock</hi> in purſuit of the Enemy; but he being ſenſible that the Enemy were gone from thence, and that his Souldiers were much wore-out &amp; fategu'd in the hard Service they had already done, &amp; wanted to get home, call'd a Council, and agreed all to go home, which accordingly they did. To Conclude this Expedition, I will juſt give a hint of ſome treatment Col. <hi>Church</hi> had before &amp; after he came home: for all his great Expences, Fategues &amp; Hardſhips in and about this Expedition, <hi>(viz)</hi> He received of his Excellency <hi>Fifteen Pounds</hi> as an earneſt Peny towards Raiſing of Volunteers; and when he came to receive his Debenture for his Colonels Pay, there was <hi>

                  </abbr> due to him; and as for his Captains Pay, &amp; Man <hi>Jack</hi> he has never received any thing as yet. Alſo after he came home ſome ill mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Perſons did their endeavour to have taken away his Life, for that there was ſome of the <hi>French</hi> Enemy Kill'd this Expedition: but his Excellency the Governour, the Honourable Council and Houſe of Repreſentatives ſaw cauſe to Clear him, and gave him Thanks for his good Service done.</p>
