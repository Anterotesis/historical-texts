            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>IT is with no ſmall degree of diffidence that I ſit down to expoſe and controvert the falſe reaſoning in a late publication called "The Age of Reaſon;" eſpecially as the author of it has riſen to a very high degree of eminence by two very popular productions, deſervedly eſteemed—"COMMON SENSE," and the "RIGHTS OF MAN;"—and eſpecially conſidering that the fame of the two laſt mentioned works may probably bias the public opinion in favor of the <hi>"Age of Reaſon."</hi> But Mr. Paine's attempt to invalidate the divine authority of revealed religion, reminds me of what befel one of the greateſt geniuſes for carica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that Europe ever produced—I mean Hogarth the painter. Hogarth was eminent in the line of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, but he needs muſt turn poet; and he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs expected to excel in that alſo. Churchill (who was born a poet) convinced him of his error, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing his bad verſes in ſo ludicrous a manner, that Hogarth, vexed, diſappointed, and mortified to a great degree, did not long ſurvive the ſhock he had received. Well would it be, were Meſſrs. Hogarth and Paine the only lamentable inſtances of the eccen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tric vanity and folly even of men of genius, when, leaving their own proper ſphere, they meddle with what they are not properly acquainted with, and by no means competent for.</p>
            <p>Mr. Paine's "AGE OF REASON" has been in ſome meaſure anſwered, and ſo far refuted, by the author of a little pamphlet which lately appeared, called "The Folly of Reaſon, being our perfect and unerring guide to the knowledge of true religion:" but I wiſh he had deſcended to ſome other particulars; or that ſome perſon, of more leiſure and greater at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> than
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:030423_0003_0FE6D0864021D428"/>I have, had ſtepped forth and ſupplied the deficiency. I am perſuaded this might eaſily have been done in a maſterly manner by many of our clergy, of every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination: but as Mr. Paine and other deiſts are moſt unreaſonably prejudiced againſt even the <hi>good</hi> and <hi>honeſt</hi> part of the clergy—nay even againſt the whole of them, of every nation and every church.<note n="*" place="bottom">That too many bad men (perhaps ſome of them deiſts, or atheiſts) got into the prieſthood—eſpecially in countries where high preferments and emoluments were annexed to the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on—is a lamentable truth. And that kings and princes ſhould endeavour to gain the intereſt and ſupport of theſe men, is no way ſurprizing. Indeed what is there valuable on earth, which great men have not endeavoured to engroſs, that it might contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to their aggrandizement? But is religion, or are talents, riches, or any thing which contributes to the comfort and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of life, leſs to be valued on that account? Certainly not. The ſame ſun, which enlivens and enlightens nature, directs the pirate, the highwayman, and the murderer to the commiſſion of crimes; and the houſe-breaker and adulterer take advantage of the light of the moon, to guide them in the execution of their fell purpoſe. Gold may be employed to corrupt the friend, or the patriot—hire the aſſaſſin—or betray innocence: But ſhall we therefore deſpiſe gold, or refuſe the light of the ſun and moon? By no means.
<p>Riches, in the hands of a good man, are a valuable bleſſing: they enable him to promote uſeful inſtitutions: to feed the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, clothe the naked, and relieve the diſtreſſed. In the hands of bad men, what bleſſing is there which has not been pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Law, government, phyſic, the gift of ſpeech, the arts of writing and printing; and even liberty, ſacred liberty! they have turned into licentiouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>That there have been great numbers of the clergy, in ſome countries, who have been men of blameleſs and exemplary lives, and adorned the goſpel by their conduct and the effect of their diſcourses, no one can deny. In oppoſition to this worthy claſs of men, there always have been, and it is to be feared will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to be, men of corrupt hearts and morals in every ſtation of life: but reaſon and common ſenſe ſay, that doubtleſs we ought to diſcriminate.</p>
               </note> And as Mr. Paine has attacked religion with only scuffs, puerile jeſts, and bold aſſertions without proofs—they might probably think his publication almoſt below
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:030423_0004_0FE6D0864CF250D8"/>contempt, and unworthy their ſerious animadverſions—at leaſt from the preſs.</p>
            <p>The following eſſay being compoſed by a layman, the fruit of long enquiry and full conviction—muſt obviate one of the ſtrongeſt objections of the deiſts. I will therefore caſt in my mite—as perhaps in duty bound.</p>
            <p>I have neither leiſure nor inclination to follow Mr. Paine in all his cavils and windings; ſome of them are ſo futile, ſo full of bare aſſertion, and buffoonery, as to be an anſwer to themſelves, ſatisfactory enough to every intelligent perſon. But I ſhall endeavour to anſwer every objection worth anſwering; and, I hope, in ſuch a manner as to ſatisfy the ſerious, the candid, and unprejudiced reader. As to the would-be-critics, and witlings, all I have to ſay to them is, That it was not the hope of their approbation that prompted me to write this eſſay; nor will their frowns ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent my attempting what I think is right.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to method and ſtyle, I well know that this eſſay will ſtand in need of much indulgence from the <hi>true</hi> critics: and as candour, and a readineſs to obſerve the good intentions of any author, and the merits as well as demerits of any production, is always found with them—I humbly hope from that quarter, eſpecially when I declare that this is the firſt eſſay I ever attempted,—that it was compoſed at broken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals of time, after attending to the buſineſs of the day—that my literary education is very confined—and that I purpoſely ſtudied plainneſs and ſimplicity of ſtyle, that the work might be rendered more generally uſeful to that claſs of readers for whom it is more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately intended.</p>
            <p>Conſcious, therefore, of the rectitude of my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I addreſs myſelf to my book: "Go, little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, and plead the cauſe of truth and virtue!—Thy enemies may be numerous, but be not thou diſmayed. A few friends thou wilt unqueſtionably find amongſt
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:030423_0005_0FE6D091479208B8"/>the lovers of candour and religion, notwithſtanding thy ruſtic appearance; and it is the friendſhip of theſe which thy father is moſt ſolicitous thou ſhouldeſt cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate—With this hope he ſends thee into the world; and commits thee to the guardianſhip of an Arm all-powerful."</p>
            <p>
               <g ref="char:dtristar">*⁎*</g> This work was written in 1794, in a ſtyle and manner ſomewhat new, but being the author's firſt eſſay, his unaffected diffidence prevented its coming forward till now, encouraged by a few intelligent friends.</p>

            <p>MR. Keatinge, in his "Folly of Reaſon," has at leaſt proved the inſufficiency of Human Reaſon, in its preſent imperfect and depraved ſtate, being "our perfect and unerring guide to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>true</hi> religion:" and I ſhall only beg leave to add, that what we commonly call <hi>reaſon</hi> in man, is only a reaſoning faculty, which may be miſinformed a thouſand ways, and biaſſed by ten thouſand motives, but eſpecially by love, or the chief deſire of the heart. What has human reaſon done, in the knowledge of theology, amongſt the Hottentots at the Cape of Good Hope? amongſt the Indians, and many other nations of reaſoning mortals, where the light of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine revelation has never appeared? Witneſs Athens, ſo juſtly celebrated for human ſcience and literature—what fools, or worſe than fools, they were in true the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology! Nay, even (how unlike our modern philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers!) they themſelves confeſſed their own ignorance, by dedicating one of their altars <hi>"To the unknown God;"</hi>—though, in fact, this was the moſt rational act of devotion they had ever performed.</p>
            <p>Whatever Deiſts may think, mankind ſtood in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute need of a revelation, in addition to what is generally called the light of nature, or the knowledge ariſing from that part of true theology which contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plates the glorious fabric of the univerſe, its creation, wonderful harmony, and preſervation.</p>
            <p>It appears to me, that mankind, in their fallen, corrupted ſtate, were either incapable, or not deſirous,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030423_0007_0FE6D092B70B81C8"/>of ſtudying natural religion (if I may ſo expreſs my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) and fell into a thouſand abſurdities reſpecting the object of adoration, and the manner of worſhipping the Great Firſt Cauſe of all things; and that the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely wiſe Creator, in compaſſion to their weakneſs, gave them in his own good time (gradually, and in ſuch a meaſure as they were capable of receiving it) an expreſs revelation by angels; by men, whom they could hear at leiſure, and converſe with as brethren, and who proved the divinity of their miſſion by aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing miracles, performed by a word, and frequently in the preſence, not of a few individuals only, but of whole cities and nations; and, when theſe failed of their intended effect, God ſent his Son into the world, who united with his divine nature that perfect moral image of God which mankind had loſt in Adam; and in this ſenſe, he might very properly be called the ſecond Adam, or repreſentative of the human race—the firſt repreſentative having, through diſobedience, "Brought death into the world, and all our woe;" and thoſe forfeited rights being now to be recovered and reſtored by the obedience of the ſecond.</p>
            <p>To maintain the honor of the moral government of the Deity—to diſplay his ſtupendous love to man—and to enjoy the godlike luxury (if I may ſo call it) of redeeming millions from darkneſs, ſlavery, and death eternal, I ſee no impropriety or injuſtice in Jeſus Chriſt's ſuffering the penalty due to others.—As God, he knew all things, and was well acquainted with the terms of his errand.—As man, this great philanthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſt "for the joy that was ſet before him," gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a voluntary ſacrifice, and cheerfully ſubmitted even to death itſelf, that by his reſurrection and aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he might exalt the dignity of human nature, and by his example ſhew mankind the road to virtue, to happineſs and heaven.</p>
            <p>I muſt own, that the <hi>manner</hi> of the Deity's uniting the human nature to his own, in the perſon of Jeſus Chriſt, is far beyond our comprehenſion, at leaſt in
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030423_0008_0FE6D092C9A6EE98"/>this infancy or firſt ſtage of our exiſtence; but ſo are many of the ways and works of God:—even the manner of our own ſpirits being united to groſs mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial bodies compoſed of jarring elements, ſhortly to become a maſs of corruption, and return to their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal duſt. But the name of the incomprehenſible Jehovah is "Wonderful."—He is wonderful in his eternity; in his infinite, uncreated beauty, perfections, and glory, and in the diſplay of thoſe perfections, in his power, wiſdom, and goodneſs, made obvious to every intelligent creature in creation and preſervation; and to the wiſe (who are taught of God) in his works of providence and redemption—Yet creatures of yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday, whoſe reaſoning (comparatively ſpeaking) is blindneſs and folly, and whoſe utmoſt ſtretch of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception can reach only to the knowledge of "a little part,"—would fain limit Infinite Wiſdom, and call Omnipotence to an account at the bar of infatuated impotence!!! "His ways are not as our ways, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are his thoughts as our thoughts."</p>
            <p>Jeſus Chriſt clearly proved himſelf to be the Son of God; not in the ſame ſenſe as human intelligences are ſaid to be, but in an extraordinary and ſuper-eminent degree—as "Immanuel, God with us." He proved his almighty power by commanding and receiving obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience from the united fury of a boiſterous wind and ſea; by giving ſight to thoſe born blind, hearing to the deaf, reaſon to the deranged in mind, health to the leprous, feet to the lame, ſtrength to the paralytic, and life to the dead.</p>
            <p>The deiſts themſelves acknowledge that the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines Jeſus Chriſt taught, were an excellent ſyſtem of morals, never exceeded by any; and that the whole of his conduct correſponded with the purity of his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine: but they ſeem willing to paſs by his theology— particularly the plain and clear declarations of the great mercy and love of God to the fallen race (which before that time they could only gueſs at, and were in much doubt and uncertainty of) and their ſalvation
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030423_0009_0FE6D09BD0AB97E8"/>by his death and reſurrection. Whether Mr. Paine, and ſome others, think themſelves ſinners or not, a ſenſe of guilt, and the neceſſity of an atonement to offended juſtice, ſeems to have been the <hi>feeling</hi> ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all nations. Witneſs the numerous, coſtly ſacrifices, even of their own children, with a view to expiation. In addition to this, there is an awful hour approaching—an honeſt trying hour—when the heart will be detected, and the man appear as he really is:—An infidel candidate for eternity on a death bed is a ſcene ſhocking beyond deſcription:
<q>
                  <l>"No hope—no proſpect of a kind reprieve,</l>
                  <l>"To ſtop his ſpeedy paſſage to the tomb:</l>
                  <l>"But all is melancholy—all is ſad!</l>
                  <l>"Where then is comfort—where is conſolation to be had?"</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Let "Fools make a mock at ſin"—if they pleaſe (and they are only fools and madmen who will be guilty of a folly ſo refined) numerous inſtances might be produced wherein a death-bed has effected a ſad change of ſentiment, and made the ſtouteſt ſinner trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. To ſay nothing of Spira, Wolſey, Rocheſter, Shaftſbury, and many others, I could here mention the names of two of my acquaintance who fell victims at the ſhrine of infidelity. One of them, who was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally thought to be a man of excellent underſtanding and fine intellect, who (many years ago) from read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the writings of the Deiſts, imbibed their opinions, and publicly profeſſed them. He was ſeized with a lingering diſorder, which terminated his exiſtence: but, ſeveral months before his death, he was in great agony and diſtreſs of mind, on account of his deiſtical principles—and would hardly, even to the laſt, receive any comfort, particularly becauſe "<hi>he had denied the Saviour,</hi> the Lord of life and glory."</p>
            <p>But I ſhall never forget the other, more recent, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the pernicious effects of infidelity. Not many years ago, a gentleman in the ſtate of Virginia,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030423_0010_0FE6D09BDC3701D8"/>with whom I was formerly well acquainted, a man of an affluent fortune, married to an accompliſhed lady by whom he had ſeveral fine children, and much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected for his urbanity and other good qualities—took to reading and ſtudying the writings of deiſts, from which he imbibed their opinions. He committed <hi>ſuicide.</hi> I have a letter from a friend and correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of undoubted veracity, informing me that this raſh act was one of "the fatal effects of infidelity."</p>
            <p>Of what uſe will the higheſt attainments in the knowledge of politics, and the ſcience of government, be, in the article of death. Theſe are nevertheleſs highly neceſſary ſpecies of knowledge; but they cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ought not to ſuperſede that which alone maketh wiſe to ſalvation. To prepare for eternity is the grand buſineſs of life; and happy will that man be, who can ſay, with triumph, at the laſt hour, "O death! where is thy ſting? O grave! where is thy victory?</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſay nothing about inſpiration; becauſe Mr. Paine himſelf admits that the Deity, doubtleſs, can communicate from himſelf to his creatures, in what manner he pleaſes; and becauſe the ſubject has been already treated of, and proved to demonſtration, by abler pens.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the divinity of Jeſus Chriſt, it was his own repeated declaration, the truth of which he abundantly proved by his almighty and benevolent works; and by the wonders which he wrought in open day, in the preſence of multitudes, many of whom were his bitter enemies, whoſe ſpiritual pride, covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and hypocriſy, he expoſed: and theſe multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes could not, and did not, deny the facts—nor that they were ſupernatural. Indeed, nothing leſs than that almighty word, which pronounced, "Let there be light," and light was, could produce ſuch mighty works. Probably, had they continued to be performed, and performed by men at this day, we might have thought they were only the powers of (what we call) nature, brought to view: but as God
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030423_0011_0FE6D09CEB9DB9C8"/>did not ſee fit to continue thoſe miracles longer than he thought they were neceſſary to command the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankind to the divinity and meſſage of Jeſus Chriſt, and to the ſame meſſage continued by his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate apoſtles—the end being anſwered, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew that power: and ſince that time, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great oppoſition, the goſpel has been attended with remarkable ſucceſs—owing to the excellence and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of its own nature, and to the powerful effects of it on the heart, when applied thereto by the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>I am ſurprized at Mr. Paine's ignorance of the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Jeſus Chriſt, when he ſuppoſes, that, even after his appearance in his public character, he was "not much known, and lived concealed!"—Let him, or any other man in his ſenſes, read the hiſtory, and they will ſoon be convinced of the falſity of this aſſertion—as alſo of one, equally wiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> "That he could not write." He certainly could write with his finger, and why not with a pen? I can find no excuſe for ſuch profound ignorance, unleſs it is that which Mr. Paine makes for himſelf—"that he keeps no bible," and conſequently that he <hi>reads</hi> no bible. In <hi>this,</hi> at leaſt, I give him full credit; becauſe the whole of his "Age of Reaſon" bears uncontradictory evidence that <hi>here</hi> he ſpoke the truth.</p>
            <p>One of Mr. Paine's objections to the ſacred ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is, "That Jeſus Chriſt wrote none of his own hiſtory himſelf."—But, on ſerious inveſtigation, will it not appear to have been much more wiſely ordered, that an account of his mighty works and doctrine, ſhould be recorded by others, who were honeſt men—who were eye and ear-witneſſes to the facts—and who could have no intereſt in deceiving?—"Let another praiſe thee, and not thy own lips," is a leſſon of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty and humility which he conſtantly taught by his example, and is generally allowed to be a ſure ſymptom of merit. As man, He never ſought his own glory, but the glory of the Father, by whoſe power he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030423_0012_0FE6D09CF90507D8"/>the many good works, and by whoſe commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he delivered the heavenly doctrine.</p>
            <p>I muſt here remark, that, in the few infidels I have had an opportunity of converſing with, I always found a remarkable ignorance of the ſcriptures—ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a few paſſages which they thought exceptionable, and which they had occaſionally gleaned from books, or from the converſation of other people; and that they had taken refuge in infidelity (ſpeaking evil of the things they underſtood not) and were oppoſed to the ſcriptures becauſe the ſcriptures were oppoſed to their tempers and practices; and theſe they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to rectify or forſake. I perceived, too, that their infidelity lay more in the heart than in the head: and we all know that mankind are more readily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to believe what they wiſh, than what militates againſt or condemns their favorite deſires and purſuits, even in caſes where theſe are allowed by all other men to be unlawful, and of pernicious conſequence.</p>
            <p>Mr. Paine, and others of his way of thinking, allow that Jeſus Chriſt was a good man—a philanthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt—a teacher of moral virtue—and a lover of truth; and that he ſuffered from the very men for whoſe wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare he had lived. Now, if he was all this, what are we to underſtand he meant by ſaying that "He and the Father were one"—that "He was the true bread from heaven"—that "He came to give his life a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom for many"—that "He was ſent by the Father to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt"—that "He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the Father, and was ſoon to return to Him"—and when Philip ſaid, "Lord, ſhew us the Father and it ſufficeth us," he anſwered, "Have I been ſo long time with you, and haft thou not known me, Philip? He that hath ſeen me hath ſeen the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther" (as far as mortal or material eyes could ſee him) "Believe me, that I am in the Father, and the Father in me; or elſe believe me for the very work's ſake"—and many paſſages to the ſame purpoſe? If Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030423_0013_0FE6D0A221513878"/>was not the Son of God in an extraordinary degree, how could he make ſuch declarations? And if Mr. Paine admits one part of the hiſtory to be true, he muſt admit the whole, becauſe he cannot prove any part of it to be falſe.</p>
            <p>What temptations had the firſt publiſhers of the goſpel to record falſehoods, when what they recorded was directly oppoſed to the manners and prevailing vices of Jews and Gentiles—to their prejudices, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſions, and eſtabliſhed religions? If honours, wealth, eaſe, and worldly comfort were their object, they purſued the wrong path: for they experienced no inconſiderable portion of contempt and reproach, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and ignominy. Their maſter had ſet them an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and they cheerfully trod in his ſteps—they took up the croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame, and endured perſecution even unto death, being ſupported and comforted by the ſpirit of God, enjoying a good hope through grace, and drawing all their ſtores of conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from futurity.</p>
            <p>Permit me here to borrow the words of an eminent author on this ſubject. "How certain," ſays he, "is the truth of the Chriſtian religion, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of the reſurrection of Chriſt, which is a matter of fact on which chriſtianity is founded! We have almoſt all the concurrent evidences that can be derived from human teſtimony, joining to confirm this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous truth. The fact is not impoſſible; concurrent circumſtances caſt a favourable aſpect on it; it was foretold by one who wrought miracles, and therefore not unlikely, nor unexpected. The apoſtles and firſt diſciples were eye and ear-witneſſes, for they converſed with their riſen Lord; they were the moſt plain, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men, in themſelves; the temptations of worldly intereſts did rather diſcourage their belief and report of it; they all agree in this matter, though they were men of different characters, <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Fiſhermen,</hi> and <hi>Publicans</hi>—men of <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Galilee,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome <hi>Heathens</hi> who were early converted. The
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030423_0014_0FE6D0A22D8A3FB8"/>thing might eaſily been diſproved if it were falſe; it hath been conveyed, by conſtant tradition and writing, down to our times. Thoſe who at firſt doubted, were afterwards convinced by certain proofs; nor have any pretended to give any proof to the contrary—but merely denied the fact with impudence, in oppoſition to all theſe evidences." And let me add, it hath been carried down to our times accompanied with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain rights and ceremonies, received in all ages ſince their firſt appointment. And it appears, by what happened not many days after the aſcenſion of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> at the day of Pentecoſt, that moſt of the three thouſand then converted, were the very men who had conſented to, or probably taken a more active part in, his crucifixion and death; which appears evident from their being pricked to the heart when Peter and the reſt told them (among other things) that "they had crucified the Lord of Life and Glory;" and they cried out, "Men and brethren, what ſhall we do?"</p>
            <p>Would it not puzzle Mr. Paine to get over the wonderful "gift of tongues," which happened at this feaſt? And is it not aſtoniſhing that ſuch a number of illiterate men ſhould, all at once, be enabled to ſpeak in twelve or fifteen different languages, with facility, perſpicuity, and power, ſo as to aſtoniſh the vaſt mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes that were then and there collected together? But, perhaps, Mr. Paine may boldly deny the whole hiſtory. With equal propriety, and for the very ſame reaſon, he may object to the whole hiſtory of England, or of any other country—becauſe he never ſaw the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons done which are therein recorded, or the perſons of whom the hiſtory may give an account.</p>
            <p>Another ſubject which falls under the laſh of Mr. Paine's ridicule, is that of miracles. By a miracle, I underſtand, a diſplay of power far above human, or any thing known before or ſince in nature; and above, or contrary to, its known eſtabliſhed laws. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and evidence of miracles have been elucidated by
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030423_0015_0FE6D0A58A80A8E0"/>much abler pens than mine—It is unneceſſary, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for me to ſay any thing on the ſubject.</p>
            <p>As to the hiſtorical part of the old teſtament, Mr. Paine's main cavil and objection will appear to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a ſtrong proof of its authenticity. What does all <hi>true</hi> hiſtory exhibit, but a picture of the folly, pride, ambition, tyranny, and cruelty of kings, and thoſe in power—the deep-laid ſchemes and intrigues of courts and courtiers—private and public maſſacres of mankind—wars, tumults, and a long et cetera of crimes? with, probably, now and then, a tolerably good character, and ſome praiſe-worthy actions. The ſtubbornneſs of the ſix hundred thouſand who came out of Egypt is no ways ſurprizing, when we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that they were newly emancipated from a ſtate of abject ſlavery, in which they and their predeceſſors had been held for above four hundred years. Even the hiſtory of Sampſon (held in ſuch ſovereign contempt by Mr. Paine) is not altogether ſo unintereſting as he ſuppoſes. It conveys uſeful, and I may add neceſſary, inſtruction. It ſhews, 1ſt, That great bodily ſtrength without wiſdom and the fear of God, inſtead of being beneficial, may become very hurtful to the poſſeſſor: 2dly, That any connection with a wicked woman is unſafe, and (like every other connection which has not virtue for its foundation) ſeldom or never ſincere or permanent; conſequently that no confidence is to be placed in women of bad character; and 3dly, To have nothing to do with them.</p>
            <p>The hiſtory of Jonah certainly contains ſome very ſerious, important, and uſeful information, of various kinds, ſo obvious that I need not waſte my time or tire the reader's patience with producing proofs. I ſuppoſe a laugh, or ſmile, was all Mr. Paine intended to raiſe by his <hi>pretty little conceit</hi> of Jonah ſwallowing the whale: if ſo (was not the ſubject of too ſerious a nature to admit of it) it would be almoſt a pity to deny his vanity that trifling gratification.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:030423_0016_0FE6D0A597BB0ED8"/>
Mr. Paine puts the Spaniſh proverbs on a footing equal, if not ſuperior, to thoſe of Solomon. I leave this point to better judges: for my part, I do not he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate to believe that the Spaniards, as well as the Scots, borrowed their beſt proverbs from Solomon, with the alteration only of the idioms and phraſeology peculiar to their ſeveral countries. The Pſalms of David are allowed by Hebrew ſcholars, and other good judges, to be the ſublime and animated aſpirations of pious and enlightened minds—who, as well as Solomon in his dedication of the temple, and all the prophets, inſtead of neglecting or deſpiſing what is indeed true theology (as far as it goes) every where earneſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended it; as do the whole ſcriptures. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce only one or two inſtances:—Iſaiah ſays, "Lift up thine eyes now, and behold! Who hath created all theſe? Who bringeth them forth by their numbers, and calleth them by their names? I, JEHOVAH, &amp;c." The Deity is often introduced as "the Creator of heaven and earth, the ſea, and all that in them is;" and mankind often called upon to conſider Him in this point of view. Mr. Paine ſeems to have entirely forgot, or never attended to all this. He remembers, indeed, part of what Jeſus Chriſt recommended on this ſubject; but forgets that it is plainly and ſtrongly hinted at in the New Teſtament by others. As a proof, it will be only neceſſary to read, amongſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inſtances which might be given, Paul's excellent diſcourſe to the Athenians.</p>
            <p>I think Mr. Paine will not deny that the moral law (the ſum and ſubſtance of which, and of all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, is—"To love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and thy neighbour as thyſelf") is truly reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, even in the very nature and relation of beings, and the eternal fitneſs of things. To love the Infinite Source of uncreated beauty, the Author and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of happineſs and being, upon whoſe power and goodneſs we every moment depend—to love in our neighbour whatever we ought to love in ourſelves—
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030423_0017_0FE6D0B0D56612B8"/>and whatſoever we would that men ſhould do unto us, to do even ſo unto them—is certainly juſt and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; is conſiſtent with the great purpoſe of God in ſending his Son into our world to reſtore loſt ſinners to that ſupreme love to Himſelf, and beneficence to our fellow creatures, in which only the primitive recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of our nature conſiſted; and obviouſly tends greatly to enhance our happineſs.</p>

            <p>THIS ſubject being already diſcuſſed by much abler pens (<hi>viz.</hi> Newton and others) I mean only to ſuggeſt a few hints.</p>
            <p>Were we better acquainted with the idioms and phraſeology of the times in which the prophets lived, their prophecies would not appear ſo dark to us. Moſt of them ſeem to have been well underſtood by the tyrants and wicked rulers of thoſe days—as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the cruel perſecution, even to death, againſt the prophets, for telling thoſe tyrants painful and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable truths.</p>
            <p>The prophets often ſpake in hieroglyphics, a mode of writing then much uſed; as if we ſhould ſay, "The lion and unicorn did ſo and ſo—the bald ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle will do ſo and ſo—and, where the <hi>inſurgents</hi> are, there the eagles will be gathered."</p>
            <p>They propheſied of many events, which they lived to ſee accompliſhed; ſome have been fulfilled ſince their deaths; and ſome are yet in the womb of time. Cyrus was named, and his remarkable conqueſts fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, about two hundred years before he was born—All the prophecies reſpecting the Meſſiah were literally
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030423_0018_0FE6D0B0E1804F28"/>fulfilled in the perſon of Jeſus Chriſt. The prophecy of Jeſus (who was the great prophet of his church) reſpecting the deſtruction of Jeruſalem, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent calamities, were fulfilled in a remarkable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: and Euſebius informs us, that the Chriſtians at Jeruſalem, relying on that prophecy, and regarding their Lord's advice, left the city, and fled to a place of ſafety out of its neighbourhood, where they eſcaped the calamities which ensued.</p>
            <p>Mr. Paine has paid our modern poets an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary compliment, at the expenſe of the ancient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; and greatly depreciates the character and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the latter, to appreciate the dignity of the former. I never heard before, that any poets ever pretended to foretell future events, eſpecially the fate of nations and kingdoms. The word <hi>prophet,</hi> in ſcripture language, often ſignifies a teacher; and of theſe there might be greater and ſmaller, as at this day: but that it oftener ſignifies a man inſpired by the ſpirit of the Deity, for the purpoſe of foretelling fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture great events, appears, on candid examination, to be without any reaſonable doubt or controverſy; and even ſome of theſe might have more or leſs of that gift, as Infinite Wiſdom ſaw they-were qualified to receive, or able to bear it.</p>
            <p>The prophet Iſaiah, in his 53d chapter, ſpeaking of the Meſſiah, ſays, "He was deſpiſed and rejected of men: a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with grief. And we" (the then blind, degraded, and corrupted nation of the Jews, in particular) "hid, as it were our faces from him. He was deſpiſed, and we eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him not." It appears to me, that the deiſts, who deny the divinity of his miſſion, and deſpiſe or vilify that theology which he came to inſtruct mankind in, are fulfilling the above prophecy as faſt as they can.</p>
            <p>It may not be improper here to take a ſhort view of the happy tendency and bleſſed effects of the truths manifeſted in and recommended by the whole of the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030423_0019_0FE6D0B1EE2118E8"/>ſacred ſcriptures, eſpecially of thoſe by Jeſus Chriſt and his apoſtles.</p>
            <p>All who know any thing of this revelation <hi>as they ought,</hi> find that it is not only "Glad tidings of great joy," but tends to raiſe the ſoul far above its natural beſotted and degraded eſtate; ſupplies endleſs exerciſe for its nobleſt powers; ſtrong ſupport and conſolation in the hour of adverſity (and ſeaſons and circumſtances will change in this tranſitory ſcene of our exiſtence) and at the hour of death, when even the Balaams (the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous as well as the vainglorious and ſenſual) of the preſent day, would wiſh to "die the death of the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous."</p>
            <p>I know this will be called <hi>enthuſiaſm</hi> by thoſe who are utter ſtrangers to God as their Saviour, and to thoſe ſtrong conſolations: but every perſon knows, or may know, that the ſoul has its ſenſes and feelings diſtinct from, and independent of, thoſe of the body.

            <p>I could name the perſon who, after experiencing much of the viciſſitudes of health and ſickneſs (amongſt the reſt the yellow fever) when he ſtood on the bord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of eternity, declared, "That he would much ſooner forgive the man who made an attempt on his life, than he who would endeavour to deprive him of thoſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports and conſolations offered in the ſacred ſcriptures, and obtained by all who ſincerely aſk of God for them." And, ſurely, he who from vanity, or any other motive, attempts to deprive thouſands, nay, millions (born and to be born) of his fellow-creatures—free, active, and moral intelligences—of thoſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports and conſolations, when they are moſt neceſſary,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030423_0020_0FE6D0B1FABF1000"/>cannot be a real philanthropiſt, or have the ſhadow of a right to the title; but, on the contrary (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be his pretentions) is an enemy to mankind.</p>
            <p>The Omnipreſent Deity manifeſts himſelf to every intelligence, juſt as their natures, and moral charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are diſpoſed, or fitted to receive—to the froward, he manifeſts himſelf froward—to the humble and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, he manifeſts himſelf merciful—to the obedient and loving, he is loving—(and his loving kindneſs is better than life)—ſomething like the image reflected to the perſon who looks in a mirror (if I may ſo expreſs it) and not only ſo, but perhaps, in ten thouſand different degrees of beatitude, in proportion to the nature, capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, deſire, and aptitude of the intelligent creature; his eſſential preſence is, where his gracious and where his glorious preſence are not manifeſted, felt, or known: and his gracious preſence (in many and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious degrees) where the creature is not prepared to bear the manifeſtation of his glorious preſence; and doubtleſs, he could make the whole univerſe a heaven, if all he intelligences therein were properly qualified to receive ſuch a glorious manifeſtation: read what the patriarch Jacob ſaid after being favoured with that <hi>gracious,</hi> and (in ſome degree) <hi>glorious</hi> viſion in his way to Padan-aram; <hi>Geneſis,</hi> xxviii. 16 and 17.</p>
            <p>But let us go to ſome of the more viſible and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py effects of revealed religion; by the inſtrumentality of which, miracles are ſtill performed.—Indeed the miracles wrought upon the bodies of men by ſome of the prophets, but eſpecially by Jeſus Chriſt and his apoſtles, ſeem to be types of the wonderful changes and cures effected by means of the goſpel upon the hearts of thoſe who by a living, transforming faith, willingly embrace it, and rejoice to be under the power of its bleſſed influence. The minds that are in worſe than Egyptian darkneſs, are enlightened; the ſpiritually dead are raiſed; the dumb ſpeak, and ſing; the lepers are cleanſed; the lame walk, and are ſtrengthened; the mourners are comforted; and to the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030423_0021_0FE6D0BC4B63DCF0"/>poor, and thoſe who may apprehend themſelves the vileſt of the vile, the glad tidings of "Peace on earth, and good-will towards men," are proclaimed; and this not to the outward ear only, but to the heart. The effects of this change become viſible in the life and converſation. The lover of ſin becomes a lover of holineſs; the cruel and revengeful become meek, placable, forgiving, and benevolent; the liar, a man of ſtrict probity and a lover of truth; the covetous and rapacious, beneficent and heavenly minded; the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, juſt and faithful; the drunkard, ſober and induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious, uſeful to himſelf and a credit to ſociety; the proud, humble and affable; and the profligate volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary, who enters the habitation of innocence only to deface the building, and who probably feels a refined gratification in debauching the wife or the daughter of his intimate friend—becomes, by the operation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion on his heart, virtuous and chaſte—perhaps the worthy father of a family, whom, both by precept and example, he leads to happineſs here, and points the road to an eternity of happineſs in the world to come. In ſhort, every faculty of the ſoul undergoes an entire revolution.</p>
            <p>And is this change effected by any latent power in nature? Is this the work of fallen, depraved, and corrupted man? Then may a bitter fountain iſſue out ſweet waters. No, ſays reaſon: this work is of God, from whom alone proceedeth every good and perfect gift—who "giveth liberally, and upbraideth not."</p>
            <p>After all the cavils, calumny, and contempt, with which the ſcriptures of revealed religion are treated, I cannot help believing, that
<q>
                  <l>"Were it not for that little book the preacher quotes,</l>
                  <l>"<hi>We, men of ſpirit, all,</hi> would cut our throats."</l>
               </q> This has too frequently been the caſe. The rope—the reeking blade—the fatal bullet—and the deadly cup—have, in too many inſtances, been the dernier
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030423_0022_0FE6D0BC56EB4F40"/>reſort of men who lived in the world "without God, and without hope." But let me rather veil the awful ſcene, and dwell with rapture on the bright ſide of the picture; where remembrance preſents to my mind's eye a cloud of witneſſes, to bear teſtimony to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, comforts, and deliverances which they who love and fear God, have, in numberleſs inſtances, been favoured with; by which they have been enabled to triumph over tribulation, enjoying "a good hope through grace," and having a bright proſpect in eternity.</p>

            <head>ON MYSTERY.</head>
            <p>BY a myſtery, I underſtand ſomething obſcure, unknown, or above the comprehenſion of human under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: and nature abounds with them. What we ſee with our eyes, and what the curious enquirer han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles with his hands, have, in many inſtances, no ſmall degree of myſtery in them. Man himſelf is a myſtery. But, "Who, by ſearching, can find out God? who can find out the Almighty unto perfection?"</p>
            <p>As to the myſtery of the incarnation, Mr. Paine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf admits that the Deity can make a communication of himſelf to whom and in what manner he pleaſes. A great part of the heathen theology, and even their mythology, was ancient oral tradition, miſerably changed and corrupted. And even this error of theirs might originate from oral tradition of ſome prophecy concerning the future appearance of ſome meſſenger, or extraordinary perſon, in the character of the Son of God, to deliver them from that darkneſs, uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and mental depravity, into which the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent among them ſaw and lamented they had fallen. And this ſeems to be much more probable than that the apoſtles and evangeliſts took any hint
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030423_0023_0FE6D0BD65C3BD68"/>from the heathen mythology; the whole of which they utterly renounce, and ſeverely condemn.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to what Mr. Paine ironically calls the "Chriſtian arithmetic;" (where he only expoſes his ignorance and miſrepreſentation) the Chriſtians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and maintain that the DEITY IS ONE. It is true we read of the Father, Son, and Holy Sprit; an idea of himſelf which the Deity has revealed, and was doubtleſs proper and neceſſary to lead guilty fallen man back to himſelf, to his favour, moral image, and communion. By the Father, I underſtand the <hi>Deity immanent;</hi> by the Son, the <hi>Deity emanent</hi> in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Jeſus Chriſt; and by the Holy Spirit, that manifeſtation and degree of his grace purchaſed by the obedience and merits of Jeſus Chriſt, and beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on thoſe who are willing to receive it. My reaſon is generally ſatisfied with this. The exiſtence of an unity in trinity is the declaration of God himſelf, who alone knows his own nature and eſſence; and when once I am ſatisfied that the ſcriptures are a true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of the word of God, who cannot lie nor deceive, my reaſon tells me I need no other teſtimony of its truth; becauſe <hi>this</hi> is by far the beſt and higheſt teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony I can have.</p>
            <p>At ſome happy moments the exerciſe of my reaſon is perfectly ſatisfied in contemplating the Unity in Trinity; but I have not words to expreſs properly or fully my ideas on the ſubject. Were I to uſe any term, it would be that of <hi>manifeſtations</hi>—three wonderful ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations of himſelf, diſtinct, but not ſeperate. By theſe three wonderful manifeſtations the Deity ſeems to lead mankind to a much farther knowledge of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; not only of his wonderful mercy and grace to creatures in our guilty condition, but of his holineſs, juſtice, and the inflexible regard he has to the honor of his laws and moral government, than they could ever arrive at by what is called natural theology. The glorious Deity is incomprehenſible, and will ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſo to every created intelligence. None but the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:030423_0024_0FE6D0BD72CECA48"/>and infinite Deity can comprehend himſelf. He may have, and probably has, many attributes and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections not yet manifeſted to us either by that part of his creation which we ſee and contemplate, or by reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: the idea of which, perhaps, our natures are incapable of bearing; and which, even the higheſt angel in heaven cannot yet ſuſtain. Probably the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the great I AM will be progreſſive to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. For my part, the more I think of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful manifeſtations he has already made of himſelf to the human race, the more I find I am ſhort of comprehending; and am loſt in wonder, love, and praiſe.</p>
            <p>I have endeavoured, and I hope with becoming modeſty, to rectify Mr. Paine's ideas of the Trinity. But ſurely he did not believe what he himſelf aſſerts, when he ſays, "The Chriſtians have <hi>five</hi> Deities!" amongſt which are, "The Goddeſs Nature, and the God Providence." Mr. Paine cannot be inſenſible that the chriſtians believe nature to be only <hi>the finger of God;</hi> that it is the continuance of that all-creating word which ſaid, "Let there be light—and light was;" "Let the earth bring forth," &amp;c. "Increaſe and multiply," &amp;c.—This is nature: the omnipotent power and infinite wiſdom of God, manifeſted in the creation and continuance of his works. And they believe Providence to be the ſame power, wiſdom, and goodneſs, diſplayed towards nations and individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, overruling all deſigns, actions, and events (even thoſe of free agents) for his glory, and the good of the whole; and eſpecially for the benefit of thoſe who love him, and fear to offend him; ſtill bringing good out of evil; and manifeſting this, ſooner or later, in his own good time and way; often inſcrutable to us, and even oppoſite to our and ſhort-ſighted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, and by ways and means we ſhould never have though of. "His way is in the great deep." As he is incomprehenſible in his nature, ſo is his works. And although this globe is indeed but as a ſmall ſpeck
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:030423_0025_0FE6D0C5A5243978"/>in the creation; yet to an Infinite Being, whoſe cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre is every where, and circumference no where, there is no great, no ſmall; and the infant that was born yeſterday, is as much the object of his preſence and attention (according to its nature and capacity) as the higheſt archangel in heaven; and this infant, and all mankind, live and breathe in thoſe bodies, only ſo long as his wiſdom ſeen fit—and, when he withdraws his ſupporting power, they ſink into their native ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Small as this globe we live on, is, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty probably intended it (as the ſcriptures encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage us to think) to be a theatre on which numbers of intelligences in heaven, or in many other worlds, are looking, and obtaining, in the diſpenſations of his providence, a clearer and fuller knowledge of ſome of his attributes and perfections, than they could have obtained without this means:—at leaſt, with reſpect to ourſelves it is ſo.</p>
            <p>Mr. Paine has given us a beautiful and entertaining deſcription of aſtronomy: for which I confeſs myſelf obliged to him. Here, indeed he appears to be maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his ſubject. I have long been of his opinion with reſpect to a plurality of world; and would not heſitate to follow him farther even were he to ſuppoſe the number of them almoſt endleſs. What pity, for the ſake of his character as a writer, he was not in one of them when he wrote his "Age of Reaſon!" I reverence the ſcience of aſtronomy, and wiſh myſelf a proficient therein, becauſe I think it would tend to kindle my too often cold and languid devotion; and I remember a celebrated author gives it as his opinion, that "An undevout aſtronomer is mad!" But hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now a very ſhort time allotted me to do the work of an eternity in, and that time being very uncertain, I muſt direct my principal attention and ſtudy to the main buſineſs of life. And if Mr. Paine will deſcend a while from the ſtars, I would point out to him an object near home, and a ſubject not altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy his contemplations: I mean himſelf: in which
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:030423_0026_0FE6D0C5B0AFA750"/>he may find ſomething deſerving his attention, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not entirely unknown to him, but too much ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected.</p>
            <p>Was I better inſtructed in phyſics, it might not be improper nor unentertaining to ſpeak of the very curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous workmanſhip of the body, its various members and powers, all harmonizing, and readily aſſiſting each other, for the mutual benefit of the whole; and all entirely and readily ſubject to the volition of the noble inhabitant. But that is not my intention. Nor is it my intention to attempt a diſplay of the progreſſive powers and faculties of the human ſoul; what aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing degrees it has arrived to in the knowledge of nature, of uſeful arts, and curious inventions, and in knowledge human and divine in ſo ſmall a ſpace of time; or to what degrees thereof it may arrive, or to what perfection, in the endleſs circle of eternity. Here indeed, all power, not only of calculation, but of thought, is loſt! But I intend, in few words, to ſpeak of what I apprehend to be ſome of its leading properties, which properties I take to be <hi>intelligence, activity,</hi> and <hi>love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LOVE is the miſtreſs of the ſoul. The two firſt cater for her: They ſtore the <hi>memory</hi> for her. The <hi>affections</hi> (her younger ſiſters) are all linked to her; and where ſhe and they lead, the <hi>will</hi> is ſure to follow, a ready volunteer.</p>
            <p>Every man fixes his chief love either on the glorious Creator and Benefactor; on himſelf; or on ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject below the Supreme Good. But there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain powerful ſomething in the ſoul, united to it, and placed in it as a vicegerent or judge, of the nature of which (though I have often felt it approving and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting, or diſapproving or condemning) I muſt own I know leſs than of any or of all the reſt. I know it is the beſt friend or the worſt enemy on earth, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing us night and day, not only to our moſt retired places, but even to the moſt public places of reſort, and in the midſt of our moſt favourite amuſements.
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030423_0027_0FE6D0C88C2FF308"/>This power, or principle, we call CONSCIENCE.—CONSCIENCE is not always ſo complaiſant to LOVE as the reſt of the family are. She is very ſhort-ſighted; and ſometimes ſo very fooliſh that ſhe will ſwallow poiſon, if it is adminiſtered in a gilded cup. He is eagle-eyed, looks to conſequences, and will remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate. She uſes all the little arts to coax him; and even calls in the aid of INTELLIGENCE, after having hood-winked him, or interpoſed between him and a very bright ſun that otherwiſe would ſhine upon him. But, often, all wont do. She then tries opiates—ſuch as, a hurry of diverſion and diſſipation, or a multiplicity of buſineſs. Nay, ſhe will ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade herſelf by ſwallowing ſtrong drink, and keeping, more or leſs, in a ſtate of intoxication; or by an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent (but often ſhort-lived) purſuit of ſenſual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. If this wont do, ſhe perſuades INTELLIGENCE to take a ſtrong doſe of infidelity, who then gives in a falſe report; and CONSCIENCE, offended, retires, and ſhuts himſelf up in a ſmall cloſet of his own, and falls faſt aſleep—at which all the family (but eſpecially LOVE) rejoice greatly. But ſhould adverſity, ſickneſs, or the near proſpect of death preſent itſelf, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion an uncommon ſtir in the family, CONSCIENCE awakes, ſtarts up, tells them terrible truths, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies much greater diſtreſs, unleſs they ſpeedily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to "turn over a new leaf." Sometimes they will not hearken to him; and, for want of ſeeking help where they might find it, they fall into deſpair, and die.</p>
            <p>What ſeems ſurprizing, is, that when CONSCIENCE has been long inſulted and defied, and when he has been apparently aſleep, he will ſometimes ſtart up ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, even in days of health, eaſe, and outward proſperity, and become ſo very troubleſome, that, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to get rid of him, LOVE and the reſt of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (in a frenzy) will pull down the houſe on their own heads; though, I am well perſuaded, they ſoon want
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:030423_0028_0FE6D0C899F9F2B8"/>to take poſſeſſion again: but, alas! powerful as they are, they cannot create or reanimate.</p>
            <p>Now—hoping that ſome perſon of more leiſure, and ſuperior qualifications, will improve on the hints I have thrown out—and add to them—I wiſh (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps with ſome of my readers) to come to a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: and in ſo doing I ſhall beg leave to uſe the words of a worthy friend of mine (gone ſome years ago to his reward). After ſpeaking to the unguarded readers of Bolingbroke, Voltaire, D'Argens, Hume, Chubb, D'Alembert, and others, he ſays, "If ſuch readers will deign to turn their attention to a <hi>different claſs of writers;</hi> if they will peruſe the writings of a Boyle, a Newton, a Locke, a Grotius, a Clarendon, a Weſt, a Littleton, a Forbes, and an Addiſon, whoſe <hi>learning, originality of genius, depth of penetration, amiableneſs</hi> of <hi>character, profound reſearches</hi> into the moſt abſtruſe and recondite branches of human and divine knowledge, and <hi>laborious ſearch</hi> after uſeful truth, do ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to human nature, and will render their memory dear to mankind through every period of time—I ſay, if ſuch perſons will deign to turn their attention to writers of this claſs, their riſing prejudices in favor of deiſm will be quickly annihilated, and they will wonder how any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſound judgment, who had thoroughly ſtudied the argument, could poſſibly fall into the <hi>ſnare of infidelity.</hi>"</p>
            <p>He adds—"I have deſignedly avoided the mention of <hi>any of the clergy</hi> in the above catalogue of names; becauſe they are liable to be ſuſpected as <hi>partial</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted</hi> advocates, in pleading the cauſe of chriſtianity; though I can really ſee no good cauſe why the <hi>clergy</hi> ſhould not be entitled to ſome ſhare of <hi>common ſenſe</hi> and <hi>common honeſty</hi> as well as <hi>other</hi> men; and ſurely if they are not <hi>downright atheiſts,</hi> they have as <hi>deep an intereſt</hi> in the truths of religion, and as <hi>great reaſon</hi> to dread <hi>falſebood</hi> and <hi>deluſion,</hi> in matters of eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, as any of their fellow creatures poſſibly can have. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

Nor let them blame the Almighty for ſuffering them to fall into ſuch a choſen deluſion. God hath given them <hi>eyes,</hi> and he hath given them <hi>a ſun;</hi> but he will not force open their eyes to behold the light. I would be <hi>abſurd</hi> to ſuppoſe this.

            <p>I think I hear ſome deiſts ſay—"This man (or <hi>this fellow</hi>) with his <hi>Infant in ruſtic garb,</hi> muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be ſomewhat of a <hi>ruſtic</hi> himſelf: for who but ruſtic would preſume to reaſon with <hi>us the only infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible oracles of reaſon?</hi> Nay, he preſumes, now and then, to give hints of advice to gentlemen who have been at ſchool! and, perhaps, a few of us have been at college: and if we have not been taught of God (as ſome enthuſiaſts pretend to be) were are taught of men to ſpeak Greek and Latin, aye, and to chop logic too!
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:030423_0031_0FE6D0D402598830"/>and will undertake to prove that light is darkneſs, and ſweet bitter; and that being under the dominion of very pernicious habits and practices, is the very height of moral freedom; and, in ſhort, will undertake to prove any thing we pleaſe." I anſwer, true; I am, indeed, a plain man in every reſpect, and may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times appear a little ruſtic, though I was taught to be polite and complaiſant on proper occaſions: but the deiſts will not go to church, where they may hear a great deal more of the ſame truths, and much better delivered. And though truth is plain and honeſt, ſhe is alſo meek and loving; and is willing to wait on theſe gentlemen at the <hi>preſs,</hi> without a ſurplice, or any thing that may <hi>frighten young men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think I could point out one benefit, at leaſt, which even the deiſts might receive by going to church, on Sundays eſpecially. Surely a quiet compoſing ſeat in any place of public worſhip, muſt have a happy ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to refreſh their animal ſpirits, jaded and worn out with the hurry and fatigue of diſſipation the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding day or week; not to mention the pleaſures their <hi>philanthropy</hi> might receive on ſeeing ſo many of their neighbours and friends ſeriouſly, but cheerfully, employed in the adoration and worſhip of the "Firſt Great Cauſe." They may even venture ſafely to join in ſome parts of the ſervice: for the chriſtians adore only the "one living and true God," who is <hi>God of nature,</hi> as well as of grace and ſalvation.</p>
            <p>I never heard that a deiſt received harm at church: but I underſtand many of them have had occaſion to repent their more modiſh viſits—at the card-table, the brothel, and the tavern. I beg leave to add, That they had better not be in too great haſte to turn their backs on their "Father's Houſe;" leſt the time come ſooner than they expect, when they may want to "fill their belly with <hi>huſks.</hi>" If any have been led aſtray, the ſooner the return to the favour of their offended God, the better. If any baptized infidels will ſpare a little time to read the ſacred ſcriptures (which they ſurely never candidly and thoroughly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined)
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:030423_0032_0FE6D0D40FC041D0"/>let me recommend the 2d and 3d chapters of the firſt epiſtle of John, to their ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for it were much better to conſider now, than when conſideration will be too late.</p>
            <p>I deſire, with reverence, to contemplate the Deity in his providence. It appears, that at different ages, and in different manners, he ſuffers his church to be ſifted, or winnowed; ſometimes by the ſword and fire, at other times by the tongue and pen. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent age may be a winnowing ſeaſon. And although the chaff of ſuperſtition, human inventions and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man eſtabliſhments, may be in a great meaſure blown away; or ſome of the chaff of mere nominal profeſſors ſcattered before the wind: yet let not the true chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian be dejected. He may be ſorry for others: but let him not indulge a fear that the real church of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is in danger. If the outward profeſſion ſeems to decline in one place, it will revive with power in another; perhaps in a wilderneſs, or with greater ſucceſs in the very places were at preſent it ſeems to decline. The church of Chriſt cannot be in danger, ſo long as the foundations of it are the God whoſe word ſhall endure for ever. On the rock, Chriſt hath built his church; and the gates of hell ſhall never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt it.</p>
            <p>Nor am I fearful of the effects of an infidel publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ſhould it accidentally fall into the hands of a well eſtabliſhed chriſtian; for it will probably ſet him upon enquiring more fully into the evidences of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, which will ultimately tend to confirm him in the faith—I am moſt apprehenſive for youths, whoſe minds not being fully informed, and whoſe principles not being fully eſtabliſhed, the publications alluded to may miſlead the imagination, and open a door to licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs; eſpecially as they are generally wrote in a florid ſtyle, and are calculated to lead the paſſions captive. Would young men be ſo much their own friends as to read a portion of the prophets, the proverbs, the pſalms, and eſpecially the new teſtament, every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:030423_0033_0FE6D0DA2BADEA50"/>and evening, they would lay in ſtock of divine knowledge which they will certainly find of advantage to them in every ſituation of life, and a conſolation in the article of death. For their fakes this humble eſſay is chiefly intended, which I ſhall conclude with the moral of the well-known fable of the bee and the ſpider: "The candid reader will reap improvement, where the froward critic finds only matter of cenſure."</p>

            <head>SOME THOUGHTS ON IDOLATRY.</head>
            <p>THE inattention and vicious propenſities of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and degraded mankind begot Idolatry: and, in all ages ſince its firſt introduction, idolatry has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented mankind from perceiving the beauty, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and beneficial tendency of that true theology which the works of creation and providence, and the gradual revelation added thereto, manifeſted from time to time, to call erring mortals to the knowledge of the true God: and, even in countries favoured with all theſe manifeſtations, idolatry ſtill prevents men from acquiring that great and important knowledge, not that groſs ſpecies of idolatry which requires falling down before images of ſilver, gold, wood, and ſtone, the workmanſhip of men's hands; but the <hi>idolatry of the heart,</hi> by placing the chief love of the ſoul upon gold, ſilver, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The idol of ſenſual gratification has many valuable offerings made to it; ambition, many more. But there is a lean, thin idol, compoſed of and frequently blown away by, the breath of the multitude, which ſome men worſhip and pray to; yes, <hi>pray to:</hi>—for if the only true prayer be, the lifting up of the heart, theſe idolaters "pray without ceaſing."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:030423_0034_0FE64BE0D34676A8"/>
In ſacred ſcripture, the true God, complaining by the mouth of his prophet, of the groſs idolatry of the Jews as a nation, and alarming them by threatnings to bring them to repentance and reformation, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſome who had ſet up their idols in their heart, and ſays, "He that ſetteth up his <hi>idol in his heart,</hi> I will even judge that man by himſelf, ſaith the Lord God." It is this heart-idolatry that chiefly militates againſt a pure revelation from an holy and juſt God, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents thouſands of <hi>profeſſing chriſtians</hi> from reaping that ſaving benefit which the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt offers to all: and if its effects be ſo dreadful to theſe, what muſt they be to thoſe who are ſo far gone in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity as to ſit in the ſeat of the ſcorner?</p>
            <p>The worſt and moſt dangerous kind of idolatry, is <hi>ſelf-adoration:</hi> admiring in ourſelves that reaſoning fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, which may be impaired or deranged by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand accidents; a faculty which is often blinded or led aſtray by the ruling paſſions; and, though very uſeful in matters of a theological, as well as a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral nature, is very impotent in bringing us to the true knowledge of God—of divine objects—and of what may properly be called <hi>true religion. This</hi> the Almighty has reſerved in his own hands, and beſtows it in what manner and to whom he ſees fit, in ſuch way as he does health, ſtrength, wealth, power, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of climate, &amp;c. and we ought to be truly thankful for every means of acquiring this greateſt, beſt, and moſt durable of all knowledge, which he favours us with; and not make an idol of our reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faculty, or think to ſcan or limit the ways of a Being of infinite wiſdom, goodneſs, and power, who cannot err nor do injuſtice.</p>

            <head>SOME THOUGHTS ON THE DEVIL, AND THE ORIGIN OF MORAL EVIL.</head>
            <p>A COMMON error in ſpeaking of the Devil, is in many people's ſuppoſing that name to ſignify only one evil ſpirit: whereas it properly means <hi>a legion,</hi> or the whole hoſt of apoſtate ſpirits (probably conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of innumerable millions) who are ſaid to be "the third part of heaven," with Satan, the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary or accuſer, at their head. When a number of men, a few years ago, led on by one SHAYS, raiſed an inſurrection againſt the government, it was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſaying, that "SHAYS" did ſo and ſo. So, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the king of Pruſſia, or the duke of York are ſaid to do ſo, or ſo;—though the very actions alluded to are performed by the men under their command. Juſt ſo we ſpeak of the devil. It has become the phraſeology of cuſtom, for time immemorial has given ſanction to it.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſpirits being created pure intelligences, high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly favoured and happy, delighting in the knowledge and ſuperior love of the eternal and infinitely glorious Creator.—They were created free agents, and might of courſe fall into error. Overpowered with the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diance of the glory of Jehovah, they might make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions amongſt the immenſity of his works, as a kind of relief; and, turning their attention upon themſelves, and conſidering the vaſtly ſuperior powers and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they poſſeſſed above the other objects of creation, they might transfer gradually that ſupreme love which was due only to the Moſt High, unto themſelves: ſo that, forgetting their dependence, they fell from the purity in which they were created, by tranſgreſſing the divine law, and acting contrary to the light at firſt
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:030423_0036_0FE6D0DCD57EF1E8"/>imparted to them. Being thus diſqualified for the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly abodes, they were driven from thence to the place prepared for them, for which they had previouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prepared themſelves.</p>
            <p>I offer theſe thoughts as rational conjecture only, from the few hints given us in the ſcriptures: for of the hiſtory of theſe apoſtate ſpirits we have only a few hints given us—probably leſt it ſhould call our atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from a mournful tragedy of a nature ſomewhat ſimilar, in which we are all deeply concerned.</p>
            <p>It was not merely the eating of an apple, but the loſs of the divine image by tranſgreſſion, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted the crime of our firſt parents. But as they were not ſelf-tempted, like the fallen angels, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity ſhewed mercy towards them, and gave them the hope of a reinſtatement in his favour, by a way pointed out by himſelf, whereby the communication was again opened between God and man, and man made capable of a much greater degree of glory and happineſs than that from which he had fallen. But from the fall of Adam from a ſtate of innocency, but more eſpecially from that of the apoſtate ſpirits, we may plainly ſee, that <hi>any</hi> gift, however eminent, or uſeful in other reſpects, may become worſe than nothing, when ſeparated from the love of God, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and infinite fountain of light, life, and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by a perverſion of the reaſoning intellect.</p>
            <p>The apoſtate ſpirits fell into darkneſs, and are "held in chains of darkneſs." They are ſo corrupted that they neither <hi>love,</hi> nor deſire to <hi>know</hi> real good: but love and know evil only. And inſtances have not been wanting among mankind, of ſome who by perverting their reaſon, have loſt <hi>the true light,</hi> and "the light in them became darkneſs:" and when this is the caſe, "How great is that darkneſs!"</p>
            <p>To conclude.—If this account of the origin of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral evil be rational, it will appear, that as God is the firſt cauſe of all good, the abuſe of moral liberty was
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:030423_0037_0FE6D0E6578AEAA0"/>the cauſe of all moral evil; and that natural, or phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical evil, was ſent as a means to cure or reſtrain it.</p>
            <p>Mr. Paine ſays, that the ſcriptures repreſent the Devil as triumphing over Jeſus Chriſt. Quite the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe is the truth: for though he is repreſented as prompting wicked men to put Jeſus to death, yet the reſurrection and aſcenſion are a full refutation of this miſtake of Mr. Paine's.</p>
            <p>Permit me here to obſerve, that I cannot help think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſpiritual world is nearer to the material than is generally imagined, and is in ſome meaſure hid in it, and in all men united to it. Probably every man is attended by a good and a bad angel. The bad angel comes with a cup of poiſon covered with honey: the good angel comes with a healing and comforting draught; but ſometimes with a rod alſo in his hand with which he chaſtiſes bad boys and girls ("children of a larger growth") for breaking over the <hi>hedge</hi> plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their good. He was a wiſe man, who informs us, "He that breaketh over a hedge, a ſerpent ſhall bite him."</p>
            <p>That our bodies are recipients, we all know; that our ſouls are recipients alſo (with a freedom of choice) we may know; upon this principle all education is built; whatever object our love, or chief deſire, goes out after, our ſpirits may be ſaid to feed upon, to be in ſome meaſure filled with, and to this object they will acquire a ſimilarity; when the heart is brooding, or feeding on moral evil, is it not reaſonable to ſuppoſe that, as birds who feed on carrion, by ſome inſtinct in their nature, ſmell it at a great diſtance, and move towards it; ſo evil ſpirits, by ſome ſpiritual inſtinct, find out and draw near to the ſoul that is feeding on evil or miſchief; feed with it, and prompt it to the commiſſion, or perpetration of evil actions? and he that ſeedeth on moral evil, ſhall afterwards, have his mouth filled with gravel, and his heart with gall and wormwood.</p>

            <head>ON "WHAT IS THE WORD OF GOD?"</head>
            <p>THE word of God was from eternity. It was a creating, and ſtill is a ſaving word—a word of life and power in the hearts of all who obey it. It har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monizes with the written word, and works generally by means of it. Yet God, as a Saviour, has other means whereby he calls ſinners to repentance— ſuch as ſickneſs,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:030423_0039_0FE6D0E89E021D18"/>loſſes, diſappointments, remarkable deliverances, &amp;c. The word was <hi>immanent,</hi> with God, and is God: and became <hi>emanent,</hi> partly by his works and perfectly in and by the perſon of Jeſus Chriſt; and is ſealed in the heart by his Almighty ſpirit.</p>
            <p>P. S. Some youth of ſuperficial obſervation, biaſſed by their propenſities, and pleaſed with the florid ſtyle and licentious tendency of a great part of "The Age of Reaſon," thought it unanſwerable;—but upon a cloſer inveſtigation, they will find that the greateſt part is made up of bold aſſertion without proof—buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foonery and palpable miſrepreſentation.—In this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply there is no fault found with his ſentiments on the education of youth in general, and he is rather compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented for his aſtronomy—but a reply to his falſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning on matters of much higher and more permanent concern, was all that was intended.</p>
