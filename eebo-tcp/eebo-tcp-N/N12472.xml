            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>JOSHUA VII. 13.</bibl>
               <q>—"Thus ſaith the Lord God of Iſrael, there is an accurſed thing in the midſt of thee, O Iſrael! Thou canſt not ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thine enemies, until ye take away the accurſed thing from among you."</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE preceeding chapter gave us an account of <hi>Iſrael'</hi>s beſieging <hi>Jericho,</hi> and of the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the walls of that fenced city by a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous diſplay of the power of almighty God: Upon which it is added in the cloſe of the chapter, "So the Lord was with Joſhua, and his fame was noiſed throughout all the country." And yet, one of the firſt things we are acquainted with in the progreſs of his hiſtory is, the defeat he met with in his attempt againſt <hi>Ai,</hi> a city about nine miles weſt from <hi>Jericho.</hi> This unhappy defeat filled <hi>Joſhua</hi> with great concern, inſomuch that he "rent his cloaths, fell upon his face before the Lord, and put duſt upon his head, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all day in faſting and prayer." The words of his prayer we have in the 7th, 8th and 9th verſes of the context.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:015759_0004_0F9A28DA290CB290"/>
The good God ſaw the ſincerity of this prayer, notwithſtanding the imperfections that attended it, and lets <hi>Joſhua</hi> into the true reaſon why <hi>Iſrael</hi> fled before their enemies. Says he, in the 11th and 12th verſes, "Iſrael hath ſinned—they have even taken of the accurſed thing—therefore they could not ſtand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, becauſe they were accurſed: neither will I be with you any more, unleſs ye remove the accurſed thing from among you." And now come in the words of my text, "Thus ſaith the Lord God of Iſrael, there is an accurſed thing in the midſt of thee, O Iſrael! Thou canſt not ſtand before thine enemies until ye take away the accurſed thing from among you." The <hi>accurſed thing</hi> in the midſt of Iſrael was <hi>Achan'</hi>s ſin, verſe 20, 21.</p>
            <p>It would not be unprofitable, ſhould I enlarge in deſcribing this ſin, and thoſe circumſtances relative to it, which made it ſo provoking to God; and alſo in vindicating that awful, but righteous ſeverity with which it was puniſhed. But to do this as it ought to be done, would take up too much of the preſent time; for which reaſon I ſhall paſs over all that might be ſaid upon theſe points, and immediately proceed to employ your thoughts on the text itſelf; from which the following notes are obviouſly deducible.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. Sin is an <hi>accurſed thing.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>II. This accurſed thing is too often <hi>in the midſt of a people when engaged in war.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>III. They <hi>muſt take away this accurſed thing from among them,</hi> if they would hope, upon juſt grounds, to <hi>ſtand before their enemies.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:015759_0005_0F9A28DAE96C3F80"/>
I. Sin is an <hi>accurſed thing.</hi> So it is ſtigmatized by God himſelf in the text; and with the higheſt reaſon.</p>
            <p>For 'tis an accurſed thing in its own <hi>nature.</hi> What this is we may learn from the deſcription which an Apoſtle has given us of it, 1 <hi>John</hi> iii. 4. "Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever committeth ſin, tranſgreſſeth alſo the law: for ſin is the tranſgreſſion of the law." i. e. the law of God, however made known, whether by the light of <hi>reaſon,</hi> or the <hi>revelation</hi> he has made of his will in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the old and new teſtament. Mankind are all under the law of God, in one or other, or both of theſe ſenſes; and when they tranſgreſs this law, they are chargeable with ſin. This is its <hi>nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it carries in its idea <hi>rebellion</hi> againſt the moſt <hi>rightful authority.</hi> For nothing is more indiſputable than that the God who made us is our <hi>ſovereign,</hi> and has a right to give law to us, and demand our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. But by ſin we practically call in queſtion this right of his, and reflect diſhonor on his governing authority. And what is this ſhort of rebellion againſt the moſt ſovereign majeſty, whoſe authority carries with it the moſt binding force, the moſt indubitable obligation?</p>
            <p>It implies in it alſo horrid contempt of God, and the moſt ſlighty regard to him. The language of it is, that his laws are not worth minding; that he either knows not how, or has not taken care, to make laws that are fit to be regarded; and that men can govern themſelves much better than they will be governed by an obſervance of the divine precepts. This is the practical language of ſin, whereby the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:015759_0006_0F9A28DBAAEDFD80"/>
wiſdom of God is reflected upon, and the ſupreme Majeſty himſelf treated with contempt.</p>
            <p>Moreover, ſin practically defies the power and anger of God; for his laws are guarded with ſanctions which are awfully ſevere. He has declared he will arm himſelf with power, and take vengeance on thoſe who obey not the truth, but unrighteouſneſs. And therefore to violate the laws of God, and to go on in a courſe of doing ſo, is a practical declaration that we regard not the anger of God, nor fear what he has threatned to bring upon us. The language of ſin is, that we are ſtronger than the Almighty; at leaſt, that we are not afraid of his power, or his wrath. All this is included in ſin, on which account it may, with the higheſt propriety, be called an <hi>accurſed thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is ſin an <hi>accurſed thing</hi> in its nature only, but in its <hi>effects</hi> and <hi>conſequences</hi> alſo. It has proved a curſe, and the moſt dreadful one by its miſchievous effects.</p>
            <p>'Tis ſin that has <hi>curſed</hi> the <hi>ground,</hi> ſo that it brings forth thorns and thiſtles, and obliges mankind to toil and pains to get a livelihood out of it. The curſe of God upon the ground, by means of ſin, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, <hi>Gen.</hi> iii. 17, 18, 19.</p>
            <p>'Tis ſin that has brought a <hi>curſe</hi> upon our <hi>bodies,</hi> ſubjecting them to diſeaſes and pains, infinitely va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious both for kind and degree; yea, expoſing them to death, in all manner of forms. The words of the curſe are recorded, <hi>Gen.</hi> iii. 19.</p>
            <p>'Tis ſin that has brought a <hi>curſe</hi> upon our <hi>ſouls,</hi> introducing into them confuſion and diſorder, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:015759_0007_0F9A28DC68A5AB90"/>
and depravity. 'Tis this that has blinded our underſtandings, perverted our judgments, ſtupified our conſciences, corrupted our paſſions and affections. 'Tis this that has deprived us of our original glory, ſunk our natures, and from creatures but little lower than the angels, reduced us to a level with the beaſts that periſh. 'Tis this that has commenced a war in our faculties, diſturbing the peace of our minds, and filling them with tumult and vexation, inteſtine jars and horrid inward recoilings.</p>
            <p>'Tis ſin that has brought a curſe upon this whole lower world, filling it, in all ages, with innumerable ſpectacles of woe and miſery. 'Tis this that opened the door to all that grief and ſorrow, diſtreſs and trouble, in infinitely various kinds, which has made mankind unhappy, even from the days of Adam, whether as ſingle perſons, or as ſubſiſting in ſocieties, whether ſmaller or greater.</p>
            <p>'Tis this that has harraſſed ſo many particular individual perſons, perplexing their minds, afflicting their bodies, and creating numberleſs uneaſineſſes to them, in all the different ſhapes that can be conceived of by the livelieſt imagination.</p>
            <p>'Tis this that has diſquieted families, introducing diſappointments, loſſes, croſſes, feuds and animoſities, the want of outward good things, and the ſuffering a thouſand evil ones.</p>
            <p>'Tis this that has ever been the <hi>make-bate</hi> in the church of God, deſtroying its peace and order,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:015759_0008_0F9A28DD5BA68978"/>
promoting ſtrife and contention, alienation and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection, and crumbling it into numberleſs parties.</p>
            <p>'Tis this that has been the troubler of nations and kingdoms, unſheathing the ſword and making them the devourers of one another. 'Tis this that has dethroned princes, ruined cities, depopulated coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, yea, emptied the earth of its inhabitants, filling it with ſlaughter and bloodſhed. And 'tis this alſo that has "ſhut up the heavens, and made the rain of a land powder and duſt"; 'tis this that has brought "the peſtilence that walketh in darkneſs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction that waſteth at noon day"; 'tis this that has cauſed the earth to tremble, and open its mouth ſo as to take in thouſands of ſouls at once: Yea, whenever the judgments of God have been abroad in the earth, 'tis ſin that has brought them down: To this muſt they all be attributed as the alone procuring cauſe.</p>
            <p>Nor are theſe dreadful calamities the worſt effects of this <hi>accurſed thing.</hi> Its malign influence extends beyond the grave, and reaches even to the eternal world. 'Tis this that guards the heavenly paradiſe as with a flaming ſword, ſo that there is no admiſſion for ſinners, continuing ſuch, into that bleſſed place: As the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> expreſſes it, "there ſhall in no wiſe enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatſoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie." Nor is this the worſt effect of ſin yet. 'Tis this that has made the dreadful place in the other world called in ſcripture <hi>hell;</hi> the <hi>bottomleſs pit;</hi> the <hi>lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone;</hi> the <hi>place of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:015759_0009_0F9A28DE95494F70"/>
blackneſs of darkneſs, of weeping and wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> If it had not been for ſin, there had never been ſuch a place as <hi>hell;</hi> we ſhould never have heard of <hi>the ſire that goeth not out,</hi> and the <hi>worm that dieth not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I need not ſay any thing more to ſatisfy you that ſin is an <hi>accurſed thing.</hi> That is certainly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be ſpoken of in this ſtile, which has brought mankind under the curſe of God in this world, and expoſes them to his curſe in the future one. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> is of all things the <hi>moſt accurſed.</hi> There is indeed a curſe in nothing but by means of ſin. This is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically the <hi>accurſed thing.</hi> And whatever elſe has a curſe in it, is derived from ſin.</p>
            <p>Let us, my brethren, take care to make a juſt eſtimate of ſin; not looking upon it as an harmleſs innocent thing, not entertaining an opinion of it as a ſlight inconſiderable evil; but as that which is accurſed in itſelf, and carries with it all manner of curſes. We muſt thus conceive of it. 'Tis the firſt thing neceſſary to a deliverance from the <hi>curſe</hi> it has ſubjected us to; as it will not only engage us in the work of repentance, but open to our view our infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite indebtedneſs to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who has taken upon him the curſe of ſin. And this will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire us with zeal and vigor, in the uſe of all means, that we may obtain, through him, redemption from the curſe of the law and the wrath of God.—But I muſt not enlarge. 'Tis time that I proceed to the ſecond note from the text, viz.</p>

II. That ſin, this <hi>accurſed thing,</hi> is too often in the midſt of a people, when engaged in war.</p>
            <p>This was the charge againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> now they were gone forth againſt the nations of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Says the context, "Iſrael hath committed a treſpaſs in the <hi>accurſed thing.</hi> Iſrael hath ſinned and tranſgreſſed my covenant." Nor was this the only time they were chargeable with ſin, while engaged in war. We never read of this people, when in a ſtate of war, but they are complained of as having ſinned againſt the Lord their God. And there are ſcarce any ſins but they were prevalent among them. The <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> whom God ſent with his meſſages to them, teſtify againſt their profaneneſs, their covetouſneſs, their uncleanneſs, their pride, their hypocriſy, their idolatry, and ſometimes their univerſal debauchery of manners. And it was indeed the prevalence of theſe and ſuch like ſins that engaged them in war, either putting them upon invading the rights of their neighbours, or provoking God to ſtir up their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to invade theirs. It would be needleſs to go over the <hi>wars of Iſrael,</hi> as they are recorded in the old teſtament, to illuſtrate this; but if any ſhould chuſe to be at this pains, they would find that their <hi>moral</hi> character was always ſuch as might juſtly give the holy God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

            <p>And is it true of <hi>Iſrael</hi> only, that the <hi>accurſed thing</hi> was in the midſt of them when engaged
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:015759_0011_0F9A28DF68F01E28"/>
in war? Is not this the charge that may be juſtly made againſt our land at this day?—Was it ever in a more corrupt and degenerate ſtate? Was it ever in a more unhappy ſituation, <hi>morally</hi> ſpeaking, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in war? Did we ever hear ſo loud a cry of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion? Was common honeſty ever at a lower ebb? Were extravagance, intemperance and lewdneſs ever more general? Were the ſabbaths of the Lord ever more prophaned, or his ſanctuary more polluted? Was the name of God ever more diſhonored by horrid curſing and ſwearing?—We are, in truth, a ſinful people, and have exceedingly provoked the holy one of Iſrael to anger againſt us. The <hi>accurſed thing</hi> is in the midſt of us, impiety towards God, unrighteouſneſs and unmercifulneſs towards our neighbour, and inſobriety with reſpect to our ſelves; yea, we have diſhonored Chriſt, neglected his ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, abuſed his grace, and grieved his ſpirit. This, in <hi>general,</hi> though I am grieved to ſay it, is the true character of the country, at this day, notwithſtanding all our pretences, and all our ſpiritual advantages. A melancholy illuſtration of the truth we were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the <hi>accurſed thing</hi> is too often in the midſt of a people when at war with their enemies. I now go on to the next and laſt note from the words, viz.</p>
            <p>III. That a people at war muſt take away the accurſed thing from among them, if they would hope, upon juſt grounds, to ſtand before their enemies.</p>
            <p>You ſee that <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not ſtand before the men of <hi>Ai:</hi> And what was the reaſon? 'Tis given to <hi>Joſhua</hi> by God himſelf, ver. 11, 12. "Iſrael hath
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:015759_0012_0F9A28E0299C09E0"/>
ſinned—therefore the children of Iſrael could not ſtand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies." And this is but agreeable to the <hi>covenant</hi> which God made with them, after he had brought them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> with a mighty hand and an out-ſtretched arm. Thoſe are the terms of it. "If ye walk in my ſtatutes and keep my commandments, and do them;—then ye ſhall chaſe your enemies, and they ſhall fall before you by the ſword. But if ye will not hearken unto me, and ſhall deſpiſe my ſtatutes, and not do my command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;—I alſo will do this unto you, ye ſhall be ſlain before your enemies, ye ſhall be delivered into the hand of the enemy." <hi>Lev.</hi> xxvi. And according to the tenor of this <hi>covenant,</hi> it all along happened to <hi>Iſrael.</hi> While they kept themſelves from the <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed thing,</hi> or ſoon took it away, they had the better of their enemies, and cauſed them to <hi>flee</hi> or <hi>fall</hi> before them: But when the <hi>accurſed thing</hi> was in the midſt of them, and they took no care to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it away, they fell before their enemies, or run from them, or were delivered into their hands. And as an awful illuſtration of the truth of my text, and of the threatning contained in God's <hi>covenant</hi> with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they were, about forty years after our Saviour, invaded by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and totally broken up as a people, and ſcattered among all the nations of the earth, among whom they remain as a taunt and a curſe to this very day.</p>
            <p>And God will deal, in general, after the ſame manner, with other people, as he dealt with his <hi>Iſrael.</hi> While they walk with him, and do that which is right and juſt and good, he will make their
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:015759_0013_0F9A28E0E97DD768"/>
enemies to be at peace with them, or deliver them into their hands: But if they violate the law of God, and <hi>treſpaſs in the accurſed thing,</hi> he will not enable them to ſtand before their enemies, but will give them into their hands.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the <hi>parties</hi> in the war may both of them have ſinned againſt the Lord; the <hi>accurſed thing</hi> may be in the midſt of them both: In which caſe, they are both made uſe of in the providence of God to chaſtiſe one another; and to which of them God will give the advantage is known only to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; unleſs that party in the war, whoſe cauſe is juſt, ſhould put away the <hi>accurſed thing:</hi> in which caſe they might upon good grounds hope for help againſt their enemies, ſo as to be able to ſtand before them; yea, and to tread them under their feet. Says God, in the text, "thou canſt not ſtand before thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, until ye take away the <hi>accurſed thing</hi> from among you." It may be worthy of ſpecial notice, tho' the <hi>accurſed thing</hi> was in the midſt of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet this ſhould not hinder their ſucceſs againſt their enemies, if they would but take it away. In this caſe, they might, notwithſtanding their former folly, hope to come off with glory and victory.</p>
            <p>But the queſtion here is, what are we to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by this "taking away the accurſed thing?" How is it to be done? To which I anſwer,</p>
            <p>If the <hi>accurſed thing</hi> is of ſuch a nature that the "civil arm" is neceſſary to remove it, it is, in this ſenſe, to be taken away. Thus the accurſed thing was taken away from Iſrael. The ſin of Achan was
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:015759_0014_0F9A28E1A931A780"/>
a <hi>capital</hi> offence, and it lay with the <hi>civil magiſtrate,</hi> by cutting off the ſinner, to clear the community of guilt. Accordingly, <hi>Joſhua and the Elders of Iſrael</hi> were no ſooner made ſenſible of the ſin of Achau, than they brought him under trial, paſs ſentence upon him, and put it in execution in the face of all Iſrael. In like manner, when the accurſed thing, in the midſt of a people, is of a <hi>capital</hi> nature, the civil magiſtrate muſt remove it by the death of the offender: or if it be any other crime, which it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to them, as guardians to the ſtate, to reſtrain or puniſh, they muſt, in an authoritative way, purge the community of it.</p>
            <p>And permit me to ſay here, as <hi>oppreſſion of the poor, the fatherleſs, and the widow,</hi> is eminently <hi>the accurſed thing</hi> in the midſt of us, it ought to be taken away, ſo far as may be, by the powers ordained of God to be his miniſters for good. 'Tis obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and may be worthy of ſpecial notice, there is no prohibition, among the laws of the ſupreme Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, more particularly, expreſly, ſolemnly, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly urged than this, <hi>thou ſhalt not oppreſs the poor, the fatherleſs, and the widow.</hi> Thoſe therefore who are entruſted with governing authority, would do no more than their duty, and what they are called to by the King of Kings, ſhould they exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to diſcourage oppreſſion, and guard againſt it to the utmoſt of their power, more eſpecially a the <hi>poor, the fatherleſs, and the widow,</hi> are the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed ſufferers by it. And ſhould they neglect to reſtrain and guard againſt <hi>this kind of oppreſſion,</hi> they could not excuſe themſelves from the guilt of violat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:015759_0015_0F9A28E26ACB6220"/>
a moſt expreſs command of the great King and Judge of all the earth. The 82d Pſalm begins with thoſe majeſtic words, "God ſtandeth in the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the mighty, he judgeth among the gods," that is, among civil magiſtrates. It then follows, as a peremptory command to them from the Sovereign of the world, "defend the poor and fatherleſs, do juſtice to the afflicted and needy; deliver the poor and needy; rid them out of the hand of the wicked." If it was ever proper, if it ever was, or could be, the duty of the <hi>civil magiſtrate</hi> to lay reſtraint upon the malignant vice of oppreſſion, as <hi>widows, father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs children,</hi> and <hi>afflicted needy perſons</hi> are affected by it, it is eminently ſo now.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible it may be difficult, if within the reach of the magiſtrates ſkill or power, to remove that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, which, like an overbearing flood, has made its way through theſe American States; occaſioned partly by the paper currency, partly by the neceſſities of people in this day of general calamity, but prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally by the undue love of money: But however difficult, or impoſſible, it may be for the governing power, in the preſent ſtate of things, effectually to reſtrain, in general, the affair of <hi>commercial dealing</hi> within the bounds of righteouſneſs, this may be done, and without the leaſt difficulty, in regard of thoſe widows and orphans, together with many others, who have greatly ſuffered and are ſtill ſuffering, by means of a <hi>law of this State,</hi> which obliges them to accept of four or five ſhillings inſtead of a pound, or to loſe the yearly intereſt which they depend upon for a ſubſiſtence. I fear not to ſay, that glaring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:015759_0016_0F9A28E328F369E8"/>
juſtice, and of the worſt kind too, wherein it affects the fatherleſs and widow, is eſtabliſhed by this law. It would be a diſhonorable reflection on the makers of ſuch an eſtabliſhment, who are politically dead, to ſuppoſe, that their intention was, to give oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for the cancelling bonds by the payment of one half or a quarter of their real value. As the emiſſion of <hi>paper-bills</hi> was neceſſary to the carrying on the war, they might think a law of this kind would tend to prevent their depreciation, and with this view be determined to make it: But as it is now known, notwithſtanding this, and every other device, that the depreciation has been amazingly great, and that hundreds and thouſands of helpleſs widows and orphans, to ſay nothing of others, have been reduced to the utmoſt diſtreſs by means of it, together with the law that has given it an oppreſſive efficacy, it may reaſonably be expected, that <hi>the powers that now be</hi> will interdict the continuance of this law, leſt there ſhould be the continuance of that injuſtice, which would be a diſgrace to even a pagan ſtate.</p>
            <p>I am now upon the duty of the civil magiſtrate, wherein it lies within his ſphere, to take away ſin, which is an accurſed thing, from a people, I would mention the ſad caſe of <hi>ſalary-men,</hi> and particularly <hi>the Clergy.</hi> So far as I am able to learn, moſt of the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

And ſhall government, while they know this, ſit ſtill, and look upon their oppreſſion without offering them any help? Is this as it ought to be?

                  <p>Previous to the above reſolve, and that juſtice might be done between man and man, it was enacted by government in the year 1698, that the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive courts, upon the forfeiture of the penalty annexed to any agreement, covenant, contract, or other ſpecialties—ſhould <hi>chancer</hi> the forfeiture, and enter up judgment for the <hi>juſt debt and damages.</hi>—In the year 1741, the judges of the reſpective courts, in caſe of a <hi>depreciation of the emitted bills,</hi> were <hi>particularly</hi> impowered "to give judgment for ſo much ſilver as the true debt appears to be, and <hi>in want thereof for ſo much in ſaid province bills, with the addition of ſo much more as will make amends for the depreciating ſaid bills from their preſent ſtated value, or the value at which ſuch other bills ſhould be ſtated."</hi> In the years 1744, and 1747, <hi>additional</hi> care was taken by the <hi>General Court</hi> to prevent oppreſſion by means of the <hi>depreciation</hi> of their emitted bills.</p>
                  <p>It will not, I believe, be diſowned by any, who have made themſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the character of thoſe who conſtituted our <hi>General Courts</hi> in the years above ſpecified, that they were men of wiſdom, integrity, public virtue, and political ſkill.

Surely, the Paſtors of the Churches in this State are not ſo inconſiderable and contemptible an order of men as not to be worth the notice of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, when almoſt univerſally wronged, and to an high degree. Some <hi>ſpecial proviſion</hi> for their relief is a matter of <hi>juſtice,</hi> and not meer favor, as it is by means of <hi>government bills,</hi> and a <hi>government law,</hi> however contrary to the deſign of Government, that they are oppreſſed. And ſuch proviſion, I am ſure, if inclination is not wanting, may be made, and without any great expence either of thought, time, or pains; and the proviſion might be effectual to put it out of the power of people to turn their miniſters off with any thing ſhort of the true value of what they agreed with them for, when they ſettled with them. This is all they deſire: And as it is nothing more than common equity, would it not be hard,

may I not ſay, would it not be unjuſt, ſhould they be left to groan under their oppreſſions, and to have no helper?</p>
            <p>Should it be ſaid, if what has been mentioned, was to be carried into execution, it might unhappily tend to increaſe the depreciation of the currency, which would be a great and public damage.—'Tis obvious to anſwer, there are no perſons in this, or any of the States, who have it in their power, but are ſo aware of the ſunken value of the paper-bills, as to riſe proportionably in their demands for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they have to diſpoſe of. Common labourers of all kinds, farmers, traders and merchants, take effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual care to ballance, in their commercial conduct, the fall of the medium, with an adequate increaſe of the price they aſk for their commodities: Yea, our General Court have thought it juſt and equal to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance their <hi>daily ſtipend,</hi> on account of the <hi>inhanced price</hi> of what is neceſſary for their ſubſiſtence, while employed on the affairs of the public: Nor have they in this done any other than what is right, and will be acknowledged to be ſo by all who are acquainted with the ſituation of things among us: But ſhall <hi>wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows</hi> and <hi>fatherleſs children,</hi> together with the <hi>clergy</hi> and other <hi>ſalary men,</hi> who have it not in their power to help themſelves, be the diſtinguiſhed grand ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers in this day of oppreſſive wickedneſs? When others can help themſelves, while theſe can't, ſhall Government ſit ſtill, and not exert themſelves, ſo that juſtice may be done them. God forbid, that we ſhould be any longer given up as a prey to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring teeth of avaricious worldlings?</p>

I ſhall add here, it ought to be deeply impreſſed on the hearts of our civil rulers, that they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to that God whoſe throne is in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, in common with other men; and his eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold their conduct in their public capacity, and he ſees and obſerves it, not meerly as a ſpectator, but an almighty righteous judge, one who enters all upon record, in order to a reckoning another day. And the day is coming, when they ſhall all ſtand on a level with the loweſt of the people, before the tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous bar of the righteous judge of all the earth, and be called upon to render an account, not only of their private life, but of their whole management as entruſted with the concerns of the public.</p>
            <p>If there needs any excuſe for that plainneſs of ſpeech I have now uſed, I would ſay;—"my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience beareth me witneſs," that what I have offered has proceeded, not from want of <hi>decent reſpect</hi> for thoſe who are our <hi>civil Rulers,</hi> but from faithfulneſs to God, "whoſe I am, and whom I deſire to ſerve," as well as from a tender concern for thoſe thouſands among both the <hi>Laity</hi> and <hi>Clergy,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Widows</hi> and <hi>Orphans,</hi> whoſe groanings, by reaſon of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, are heard in heaven, and may, if they are not <hi>heard on earth,</hi> bring down vengeance from almighty God, in addition to what we have already felt.—</p>
            <p>But to go on,</p>
            <p>If the <hi>accurſed thing</hi> is ſin generally prevailing among a people, it muſt be <hi>taken away</hi> by a <hi>general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</hi> This is the only effectual method in which it can be done; and it is the very one every where directed to in the word of God: and it will, of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

mercy, through the mediation and merits of the Savior Jeſus Chriſt, avail to the pardon of a people. This will bring them into favor with heaven, and engage the preſence of God with them, ſo as that they ſhall be able to "ſtand before their enemies, and tread them under their feet."</p>
            <p>What then remains, as the improvement of the preſent diſcourſe, but that we make it our care, by true humiliation and repentance, to remove ſin, that <hi>accurſed thing,</hi> from among us. It will not, it cannot with any face of reaſon, be denied, that ſin, in every kind, abounds in the land.—But if I may ſpeak what I believe is the real truth, I would ſay, <hi>that ſin</hi> which is the ſource of every other ſin, and may emphatically be called the ACCURSED THING AMONG US, is <hi>ſordid avarice,</hi> an <hi>unſatiable thirſt for money.</hi> 'Tis this that has overſpread the land with ſuch <hi>baſe ſelfiſhneſs</hi> as has been deſtructive of that <hi>public patriotic ſpirit</hi> which was its glory: 'Tis this that has engaged ſuch multitudes to "<hi>ſeek their own,</hi>" to the neglect of, and in oppoſition to, "the weal of others:" 'Tis this that has been the occaſion of that injuſtice, oppreſſion, and extortion, which is ſo generally prevalent in all parts of the country: 'Tis this that has reduced great numbers to penury and want, eſpecially among thoſe, who have had it neither in their power, nor inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to do by others, as others do by them: 'Tis this, in a word, that has ſwallowed up all ſerious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to "the things pertaining to the kingdom of God, and of Jeſus Chriſt;" inſtead of which, the gain of this world has been the <hi>great and general concern,</hi> though at the hazard of that loſs of the ſoul which cannot be compenſated. And in this view of our
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:015759_0022_0F9A28E7A905C908"/>
character, as having reigning in us <hi>this avaricious diſpoſition,</hi> which has been, and is ſtill productive of all wickedneſs, what can we expect but the frowns of heaven upon our military operations? 'Tis true, and ought to be acknowledged with gratitude, the good God has, notwithſtanding our great unworthineſs, "for his holy name's ſake, and to make his power known," given our armies remarkable ſucceſs in their conteſts with the enemy, at one time and another. So when Iſrael went againſt <hi>Jericho,</hi> it pleaſed God by a miraculous exertion of almighty power, to ſhake down the walls of that ſtrongly fenced city, and deliver it into the hands of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> the chief Jewiſh military commander. But <hi>Iſrael</hi> committed "a treſpaſs in the accurſed thing," for which cauſe they were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards defeated, and driven back by their enemies. Thus it has been with us. By remarkable interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, in the government of Providence, we have been marvellouſly ſucceeded, at one time and another, in our attempts againſt the enemy; but, as the <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed thing</hi> has been retained among us, <hi>they,</hi> by like interpoſitions of heaven, have been ſucceeded in their attempts againſt us. An obſervable inſtance of this, yea, an inſtance wherein the God that is above has, in a very conſpicuous manner, interpoſed to ſerve them, and diſſerve us, we have in the affair of <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> with what gave riſe to it, and was eſſentially connected with it.</p>
            <p>We all know, the ſquadron of capital ſhips ſent to America, by the MONARCH OF FRANCE, was kindly intended for our help in our ſtruggle with Great Britain; and we all had great expectations from what might, humanly ſpeaking, have been effected
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:015759_0023_0F9A28E86940E1F0"/>
thereby. But we have hitherto been greatly diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. But how? Not thro' any failure in the uſe of proper means, but by the exertions of that almighty Being, "who bringeth the wind out of his treaſure," or keepeth it there, as "ſeemeth good in his ſight." By contrary winds, or no winds, the fleet from <hi>France</hi> was detained ſo much longer than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in coming to the <hi>Delaware,</hi> that the <hi>Britiſh ſhips,</hi> lying in that river with all their ſtores, had oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, before their arrival, to go unmoleſted to <hi>New-York.</hi> 'Tis true, their looked for approach might be the occaſion of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> army'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> quitting <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia</hi> with ſuch haſte, and doing it by the way of the <hi>Jerſies,</hi> which proved to them a diſgraceful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, and the loſs of ſome thouſands of their men. But this was ſoon followed by that which was greatly diſadvantageous to us. Upon Admiral <hi>D'Eſtaing'</hi>s leaving the <hi>Delaware</hi> and anchoring at the <hi>Hook,</hi> near <hi>New-York,</hi> an expedition was planned, with a view to diſpoſſeſs the enemy of <hi>Rhode Iſland,</hi> by the joint operation of his fleet, and an army to be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately raiſed and ſent upon this deſign. No army, it may be, was ſooner raiſed, or conſiſted of better men, many of whom, tho' men of fortune, figure, and reſpectable characters, voluntarily entered upon this ſervice as <hi>privates,</hi> for the good of their country: Notwithſtanding which, and the moſt flattering pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſucceſs, they were diſappointed: Not for want of wiſdom in planting the expedition, or of ſkill and reſolution in the officers and men, either of the army or navy; but by interpoſing frowns in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of him who "ſitteth King forever." The next day after our troops had landed without the leaſt oppoſition, and were to have been joined by a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:015759_0024_0F9A28E928D5D798"/>
of <hi>French regulars,</hi> and the whole <hi>French fleet,</hi> they were called off, by the appearance of Lord <hi>How'</hi>s <hi>naval force,</hi> which obliged the <hi>Count</hi> to go out after, and purſue them: But before any action could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, there aroſe, at the command of that God, whom "the winds obey," an unknown ſtorm in this part of the world, at ſuch a time of the year, which diſabled a number of the <hi>French ſhips,</hi> and made it neceſſary they ſhould come to <hi>Boſton</hi> to refit.—This put an end to our <hi>Rhode-Iſland expedition.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">It may not be improper to ſay here, our Troops, under the bleſſing of heaven, retreated from <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> with ſignal ſucceſs and honor: For they not only went off with all their ſtores and baggage, without the loſs of a ſingle article; but drove away the enemy who endeavored to purſue them, with the loſs only of <hi>two hundred and eleven</hi> of our men, killed, wounded, and miſſing, which was vaſtly more than ballanced by the loſs of more than a <hi>thouſand</hi> of their's killed and wounded.</note> and the ſalutary effects we expected to reap from it. But, as it was wholly owing to the <hi>extraordinary provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God,</hi> which over-ruled this important deſign to our ſad diſappointment, we can find no fault, unleſs we would reflect blame upon the alwiſe righteous ruler of the world; inſtead of which, we might do well to reflect upon the <hi>moral cauſe</hi> of this divine chaſtiſement, which, without all doubt, is, our not "taking away the <hi>accurſed thing</hi> from among us." This can be done, as has been ſaid, in no way but by <hi>reformation.</hi> And the reformation muſt be general, extending to all orders and degrees of men, among us, from the higheſt to the loweſt; and to all ſins, from the greateſt to the leaſt. Magiſtrates muſt be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of their faults, and rectify them; miniſters muſt be humbled for theirs, and amend them; and people in common muſt be convinced of the evil of their doings, and repent of them. And in order to this
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:015759_0025_0F9A28E9E9A4B888"/>
general reformation, every man muſt endeavour to know the plague of his own heart; every one muſt come to a pauſe, and enquire what have I done? and not be ſatisfied, till every thing amiſs is done away, both in heart and life.</p>
            <p>Thus let us remove the <hi>accurſed thing</hi> from the midſt of us; "breaking off our ſins by repentance, and our iniquities by turning to God." We ſhall not do this, unleſs we betake ourſelves for help to the <hi>great diſpenſer</hi> of grace. He can diſpoſe and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence us to "ceaſe from doing evil, and to learn to do well;" he can enable us to "unlooſe the bands of wickedneſs, and let the oppreſſed go free," and to make it our care to "deal juſtly; loving mercy, and walking humbly with God." And if, in conſequence of our earneſt ſupplications before the mercy-ſeat in heaven, we ſhall be wrought upon to become a peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and obedient people, having faith in God, and in his ſon Jeſus Chriſt, we may hope, and upon juſt grounds, that our father's God will be our God, and manifeſt himſelf to be ſo by "riding in the heavens for our help, and in his excellency on the ſkies;" giving us occaſion to triumph, and ſing, as in the 144th Pſalm, beginning, "Bleſſed be the Lord our ſtrength, who teacheth our hands to war, and our fingers to fight; our goodneſs and our fortreſs, our high tower and deliverer, in whom we truſt: who ſubdueth the people under us."</p>
