            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:002400_0004_0FDB3A6808CBF018"/>1. WE have one thing <hi>ſuppoſed,</hi> viz. <hi>That a profeſſing people are ſometimes obliged to go forth to War againſt their enemies.</hi> GOD's People ſometimes have enemies moleſting, diſturbing, aſſaulting of them; ſtriving to rob and ſpoil 'em of their ſubſtance, &amp; to captivate or deſtroy their Perſons. As Mens <hi>carnal minds are enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God,</hi> (Rom. 8.7.) ſo they naturally are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt one another alſo. Man's fallen, corrupt nature, is <hi>deceitful above all things and deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wicked</hi>; it contains the Seed and root of all manner of wickedneſs againſt Men, as well as of Irreligion towards GOD. Out of Mens wicked hearts, proceed <hi>evil Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Murders,</hi> Mat. 15.19. Unregenerate wicked Men, are the <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Devil, his luſts they will do</hi>; and he's <hi>a Murderer from the beginning,</hi> Joh. 8.44. Mens hearts are naturally <hi>full of all unrighteouſneſs, wickedneſs, maliciouſneſs, envy, murder, debate, malignity; they're implacable, unmerciful,</hi> Rom. 1.29—31. In their fleſh there dwells no good thing; and what are the works of the fleſh? Why theſe are ſome of 'em. Gal. 5.20, 21. <hi>Hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, ſtrife, ſeditions, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyings, murders.</hi> Men under the reigning power of Sin, how do they live? Hear what the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſays: Tit. 3.3. <hi>We our ſelves alſo were ſometimes fooliſh, diſobedient, deceived, ſerving divers luſts and pleaſures, living in malice and envy, hatefull and hating one another.</hi> Such car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage among Men, is the genuine product of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature where it prevail, and reigns. Jam. 4.1. <hi>From whence come wars and fightings among you? Come they not hence, even of your luſts that
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002400_0005_0FDB3A69DDB54920"/>
war in your members.</hi> The prevalency of Men's curſed luſts, often produceth <hi>quarrellings, fightings</hi> between <hi>particular Perſons,</hi> in <hi>Families,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Countreys, Kingdoms, Nations.</hi> Wicked Nations are often enemies to and they often War againſt one another. And ſome or other of ſuch Nations, are often open enemies to GOD's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing People, ſeeking to ſpoil, ſubdue and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw them. This truth is ſo plain from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and experience, that I need not ſay any thing for the demonſtrating of it.</p>
            <p>AND when GOD's People are aſſaulted, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted, threatened with ruin by their enemies; they're oblig'd to ſtand on their own defence, and to indeavour the conquering of thoſe, who unjuſtly ſtrive to conquer and deſtroy them. GOD has ſometimes expreſsly <hi>commanded</hi> His People, to fight againſt and deſtroy their wicked enemies. GOD ſaid to <hi>Moſes</hi> concerning <hi>Sihon</hi> King of the <hi>Amorites</hi>; Deut. 2.24. <hi>Contend with him in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</hi> GOD gave an expreſs command to King <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 15.3. <hi>Now go and ſmite Amatek, and utterly deſtroy all that they have, and ſpare them not.</hi> There are <hi>Wars of the Lord,</hi> (Numb. 21.14. 1 Chron. 5.22.) and <hi>Battels of the Lord,</hi> (1 Sam. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>5.28.) and a <hi>Curſe</hi> has been denounc'd againſt ſome, <hi>for not coming to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord againſt the mighty,</hi> Judg. 5.23. It's as reaſonable, and often as neceſſary in <hi>theſe dayes,</hi> as it was in <hi>former ones</hi>; for GOD's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to fight againſt, and indeavour to ſubdue and deſtroy, their wicked enemies. They're indeed ſometimes, yea often, oblig'd to ſend forth their
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002400_0006_0FDB3A6CF31C4638"/>
               <hi>Hoſt,</hi> their <hi>Armies</hi> to fight againſt their wicked unrighteous enemies.</p>
            <p>BUT thus much may ſuffice for the thing <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> in our Text, viz. <hi>That a profeſſing People are ſometimes oblig'd to go forth to War againſt their enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. WE have another thing <hi>commanded,</hi> viz. <hi>When they do ſo, they ſhould keep themſelves from every wicked thing.</hi> When GOD's People are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in War, <hi>then</hi> they ſhould keep themſelves from every wicked thing. <hi>Then,</hi> it is not to be taken <hi>excluſively of other times,</hi> as thô at other times they might Indulge themſelves in wicked practices: no Indeed, for they <hi>ſhould</hi> continually, <hi>perpetually</hi> keep themſelves from every wicked thing. But <hi>then</hi> eſpecially they ſhould be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſhun all wickedneſs, when their <hi>Hoſt goes forth to War</hi>; leſt by Indulging any wickedneſs, they ſhould provoke GOD to frown on, and fight againſt them. We have general Precepts, <hi>Pray always, Pray without ceaſing. Continuing Inſtant in Prayer,</hi> Eph. 6.18.1 Theſ 5.17. Rom. 12.12. Yet GOD more particularly ſays, <hi>Call on me in the day of trouble,</hi> If any be <hi>afflicted let him pray,</hi> Pſal. 50.15. Jam. 5.13. In our <hi>affliction we ſhould ſeek God early.</hi> So that we ſhould Pray <hi>always,</hi> and yet eſpecially &amp; peculiarly apply our ſelves to this duty in time of <hi>Trouble &amp; Affliction.</hi> So, we ſhould be <hi>always</hi> careful to avoid every wicked thing; and ſhould yet be peculiarly and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally careful to avoid it, when <hi>Ingaged in War</hi> againſt our enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:002400_0007_0FDB3A6EB944B888"/>WHEN the Hoſt goeth forth againſt thine enemies, <hi>then</hi> keep thee from every wicked thing. It may Imply,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>THAT in time of War, Perſons are in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar danger of Indulging themſelves in vicious practices. Souldiers</hi> are apt to give themſelves ſuch a looſe, to take ſuch a liberty in unbecoming Words and Actions; which poſſibly they would be <hi>aſham'd</hi> or <hi>afraid</hi> to do, if at home and among their uſual Neighbours. Almoſt every condition and buſineſs of Life, has it's ſpecial or peculiar Snares and Temptations attending of it; a <hi>Souldier</hi>'s calling is attended with very great and dangerous ones. Thô <hi>Souldiers</hi> have ſtrong <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations</hi> to be <hi>Singularly Pious,</hi> yet they have ſtrong <hi>Temptations</hi> alſo to be very <hi>wicked</hi>; and they're frequently and ſhamefully overcome by their Temptations. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> ſeems to have caution'd <hi>Souldiers,</hi> againſt the evils they were moſt <hi>peculiarly</hi> in danger of committing; for when they ask'd him, ſaying, <hi>What ſhall we do?</hi> He reply'd, <hi>Do violence to no man, neither accuſe any falſely, and be content with your wages.</hi> Luk. 3.14. So that the <hi>peculiar danger</hi> of Indulging wickedneſs, in <hi>time of War,</hi> might be one occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this ſpecial command, <hi>then</hi> keep thee from every wicked thing. It may Imply,</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE very <hi>great Importance and Neceſſity,</hi> of keeping our ſelves from every wicked thing <hi>in time of War.</hi> A <hi>wicked thing,</hi> What is that? Why it's any thing, every thing that's <hi>contrary to God's Law.</hi> 1 Joh. 3.4. <hi>Whoſoever committeth Sin tranſgreſſeth alſo the Law, for Sinis a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002400_0008_0FDB3A704557EB80"/>
of the Law.</hi> Every thing that's contrary to GOD's Law, is <hi>Wicked, Sinful,</hi> and therefore hateful and loathſome to GOD. For <hi>Sin</hi> is the <hi>abominable thing whith He hates,</hi> Jer. 44.4. He is <hi>of purer eyes than to behold evil, he cannot look upon Iniquity,</hi> Hab. 1.13. And this Infinitely great and glorious GOD to whom <hi>Sin is ſo hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> He orders, over-rules, governs all things as He will; even all things in the <hi>Armies of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and among the Inhabitants of the earth, none can ſtay his hand, or ſay unto him, what doeſt thou?</hi> Dan. 4.35. Victories and Defeats in Battle, even all events of Peace &amp; War, are Intirely at GODS diſpoſe, He orders them as He will. Therefore it highly becomes a profeſſing People Ingag'd in War, to keep in good terms with GOD, to keep themſelves from every wicked thing; leſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they ſhould provoke Him to appear and fight againſt them. If they fight againſt Him by their Sins, they may juſtly fear that He'll fight againſt them in His Providence. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when the Hoſt goeth forth againſt thine enemies, then <hi>keep thee</hi> from every wicked thing. <hi>Keep thee,</hi> this may refer both to the <hi>Souldiers that go forth to War,</hi> and to <hi>the reſt of the People that ſtay at home.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>TO the Souldiers that go forth to War.</hi> Thoſe who go out to War, go in danger of their lives. It's true, if we ſtay at home, live in peace, ſeem to be moſt ſafe and ſecure and free from danger, yet we're liable to Death. Some grievous Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſudden fit, or unexpected accident may in a little while turn us out of the World. Prov.

of Men, <hi>Victory</hi> is held in GOD's hand, He gives it to whom He will. 1 Sam. 17.47. <hi>The Battle is the Lord's.</hi> 2 Chron. 20.15. <hi>The Battle is not yours but GOD's. The Lord is mighty in Battle,</hi> (Pſal 24.8.) Therefore <hi>it's nothing with him to help, whether with many or with them that have no power,</hi> 2 Chron. 14.11. <hi>The Army of the Syrians came with a ſmall company of Men, and the Lord delivered a very great Hoſt into their hand,</hi> 2 Chron. 24.24. GOD can cauſe even <hi>wounded Men,</hi> to <hi>ariſe</hi> and <hi>burn a City,</hi> Jer. 37.10. <hi>Gideon's three hundred Men,</hi> with their <hi>Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, Lamps, Trumpets</hi>; did fright, rout, and vanquiſh a vaſt Army of the <hi>Midianites,</hi> Judg. ch. 7. <hi>Jonathan</hi> and his <hi>Armour-Bearer,</hi> routed and vanquiſhed the <hi>Army of the Philiſtines</hi>; at leaſt they two <hi>began</hi> the matter, 1 Sam. 14. ch.

            <p n="6">6. IF Men die in Battle, none but GOD can <hi>ſave their Souls.</hi> The Soul is more worth than a World. <hi>Men can kill the body, are not able to kill the Soul; but GOD can deſtroy both ſoul and body in hell,</hi> Mat. 10.28. So, GOD can <hi>Save the Soul</hi> too, can pardon it's Sins (and will do ſo, if it penitently believes in CHRIST) and take it ſafe to Heaven when it parts from the body. <hi>Good Men</hi> may <hi>die in War,</hi> by the hands of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; godly King <hi>Joſiah</hi> did ſo.

ſhould die in Battle, in the High Places of the Field, yet their Souls go as ſafe to Heaven, as if, they'd di'd quietly in their Beds ſurrounded with attending, mourning Friends. <hi>Bleſſed are the dead that die in the Lord, they rest from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, their works follow them,</hi> Rev. 14.12. Their <hi>Death is their gain,</hi> they go to <hi>be with Chriſt which is far better,</hi> Phil, 1.21, 23.</p>
            <p>NOW ſince all theſe things are ſo, ſurely it becomes thoſe who go forth to War, to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from every wicked thing. If they have any thoughtful ſerious regard to their own <hi>Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> ſafety, honour, uſefulneſs, they ſhould be moſt careful to avoid every thing which might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe or provoke GOD, <hi>in whoſe hand is their breath, and whoſe are all their ways</hi>; and who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone can <hi>ſave or deſtroy.</hi> Nay, if they have any regard to the <hi>Welfare</hi> of thoſe they <hi>fight for,</hi> they ſhould be careful to keep themſelves from every wicked thing. If thoſe who go forth to War, ſhould <hi>die in Battle,</hi> or be greatly <hi>blaſted</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated</hi>; this might be greatly and variouſly hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the People they are a part of. They ſhould not Indulge themſelves in any wickedneſs, leſt GOD blaſt them, and therein blaſt thoſe they repreſent, or act for. For thô GOD ſometimes proſpers and ſucceeds wicked Men in Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt Enemies; yet ſuch wicked Men have no ground to <hi>expect Succeſs.</hi> When <hi>Amaziah</hi> King of <hi>Judah</hi> was going to War againſt the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites,</hi> he hired an <hi>hundred thouſand</hi> Auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, even that number of the Men of <hi>Iſrael</hi>; but a Prophet of GOD ſaid to him, 2 Chron. 25.7.

They are hazarding their Lives for our welfare, let us not requite 'em evil for good; let us not add to their danger, by adding to the number and weight of our own Iniquities.

               <hi>Only be thou ſtrong and very couragious, that thou mayſt obſerve to do according to all the law which Moſes my ſervant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayſt proſper whitherſoever thou goeſt.</hi> Let us obey GOD's Laws, if we would proſper in our ways, Deut. 29.9. <hi>Keep therefore the words of this Covenant and do them, that ye may proſper in all that ye do.</hi> 2 Chron. 24.20. <hi>Why tranſgreſs ye the commandments of the Lord, that ye cannot proſper? Becauſe ye have forſaken the Lord, He alſo hath forſaken you.</hi> When we Sin againſt GOD, we <hi>wrong our own Souls,</hi> lay our ſelves open to His revenges, and walk in the way lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſhame and confuſion. For, whatever we think of it, yet 'tis true, <hi>That Righteouſneſs exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a Nation, but Sin is a reproach to any People,</hi> Prov. 14.34. The uſual method of GOD's deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with His People, is ſet forth. 2 Chron. 15.2. <hi>The Lord is with you while ye be with him, if ye ſeek him he will be ſound of you; but if you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him he will forſake you.</hi> Iſai. 1.19, 20. <hi>If ye be willing and obedient, ye ſhall eat the good of the land, but if ye refuſe and rebel, ye ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with the ſword, for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it.</hi> What, wont you believe what the LORD ſays? His <hi>Mouth</hi> declares (and He <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lie,</hi> it's <hi>impoſſible for him to lie,</hi> Tit. 1.2. Heb. 6.18.) that if we <hi>rebel</hi> againſt Him, we ſhall be devoured with the <hi>Sword,</hi> or ſome Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or other (if we walk contrary to Him, He'll walk contrary to us, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.27, 28.) For theſe things <hi>written aforetime, were written for our learning,</hi> Rom. 15.4. If <hi>our ways pleasd

the Lord,</hi> we might expect that He would <hi>make our enemies to be at peace with us,</hi> (Prov. 16.7.) Or elſe <hi>ſubdue</hi> them before us, Pſal. 81.13,—15. <hi>O that my people had hearkened unto me, and Iſrael had walked in my ways; I ſhould ſoon have ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their enemies, and turned mine hand againſt their adverſaries. The haters of the Lord ſhould have ſubmitted themſelves unto him, but their time ſhould have endured for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF we hearken to GOD's Voice, and walk in His ways, we may humbly expect that He'll Fight againſt and ſubdue our Enemies; but if we Fight againſt GOD by our Sins, we may expect that He'll raiſe up, multiply and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and aſſiſt Enemies againſt us. It's extreamly fooliſh and dangerous (as well as unjuſt and ungrateful) for a People to <hi>make War against Heaven by their wickedneſs</hi>; therein they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke One that is ſtronger than they, that can blaſt or deſtroy them when He will, and uſe and ſucceed what Inſtruments He pleaſeth againſt them. Iſai. 42.24. <hi>Who gave Jacob for a ſpoil, and Iſrael to the Robbers? did not the Lord, he againſt whom we have ſinned? For they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient to his law. Jacob, Iſrael,</hi> even a profeſſing People of GOD were given up to the oppreſſing power of <hi>Enemies, Spoilers, Robbers,</hi> becauſe they were <hi>diſobedient to GOD,</hi> and would not <hi>walk in his ways.</hi> The <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> enemies, what were they, but only Inſtruments where-with GOD puniſh'd His rebellious People? Iſai. 10.5, 6. <hi>O Aſſyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the ſtaff in their hand
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002400_0022_0FDB3A8B9E3E4B58"/>
is mine Indignation. I will ſend him againſt an hypocritical Nation, and againſt the People of my wrath will I give him a charge,</hi> (they were <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion'd</hi> by Heaven, as it were to this work) <hi>to take the ſpoil and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.</hi> Our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the <hi>Indians</hi> at the Eaſtward how <hi>falſe, perfideous, treacherous, rebellious, barbarous, wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> ſoever they are in themſelves; yet we're to look on them as the <hi>Rod of GOD's anger, the ſtaff of his Indignation.</hi> He may uſe what Rod He will, to chaſtiſe and correct us. If they're but a <hi>weak rod,</hi> yet they're in a <hi>ſtrong Hand</hi> that can <hi>ſtrike hard,</hi> can whip us and make us <hi>bleed</hi> terribly before He has done with us. It is GOD (and not only the <hi>Indian</hi> enemies) that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with us, managing a controverſy with us, <hi>bringing a ſword to avenge the quarrel of his Covenant,</hi> (Lev. 26.25.) Wicked Inſtruments are but <hi>His Rod, His Sword.</hi> Pſal. 17.13. <hi>The wicked which is thy Sword.</hi> Would we therefore that GOD ſhould <hi>put up his Sword,</hi> or <hi>throw his rod into the fire</hi>? Then the way we ſhould take is, humbly and penitently to turn from all our Sins, truſt in His Mercy thrô our LORD JESUS CHRIST for Reconciliation, and walk in His ways. It's not only our Indiſpenſable <hi>Duty,</hi> but alſo our higheſt <hi>Wiſdom, Prudence, Interest</hi> thus to do. All <hi>Politick Schemes,</hi> deep <hi>Projections</hi> warlike <hi>Stratagems,</hi> are but ſorry trifles and bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles compar'd to this <hi>moſt Wiſe Method.</hi> By a penitent turning to the <hi>Lord of Hoſts, the God of Armies.</hi> Let us engage Him to be <hi>on our ſide</hi>; then He'll be <hi>our refuge, ſtrength, a very

preſent help in trouble</hi>; we need <hi>not fear tho' the earth were removed, and the mountains carried into the midſt of the Seas; He can make Wars to ceaſe, break the Bow, cut the Spear in ſunder, and burn the Chariots in fire,</hi> Pſal. 46. Let us In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage GOD on our ſide, and then He'll <hi>command deliverances for us,</hi> and help us to <hi>puſh and tread down thoſe that riſe up againſt us,</hi> Pſal. 44.4, 5. If GOD be for us, on our ſide, then <hi>we may boldly ſay, the Lord is mine helper, and I will not fear what man ſhall do unto me,</hi> Heb. 13.6.</p>
            <p>SURE I am, now the Hoſt is gone forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the enemy, we ſhould <hi>keep our ſelves from every wicked thing.</hi> In ſtead of growing more <hi>looſe</hi> and <hi>diſſolute,</hi> more <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>vicious,</hi> (as People are very prone to do in <hi>Time of War</hi>) we ſhould ſeriouſly ſtudy and ſtrive after a <hi>tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi> REFORMATION.</p>
            <p>THOSE in <hi>Civil Authority</hi> ſhould do ſo, in being <hi>Perſonally Exemplary</hi> and Conſpicuous in the exerciſe of every Grace, and practice of every Duty; in being a <hi>Terror to evil doers and a praiſe to them that do well.</hi>

Joel 2.19. <hi>Let the Prieſts, the Minicters of the Lord weep between the Porch and the Altar, and let them ſay, Spare thy people, O Lord, and give not thine heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to reproach, that the Heathen ſhould rule over them: therefore ſhould they ſay among the people, where is their God</hi>?</p>
            <p>YEA, <hi>All Perſons</hi> in their <hi>various Capacities,</hi> ſhould do what they can to promote a RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORMATION. Jer. 25.5. <hi>Turn ye again now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings.</hi> REFORMATION is what GOD loudly calls for at our hands.</p>
            <p>WE are lately entred into a <hi>New War,</hi> we know the <hi>beginning</hi> but dont know the <hi>end</hi> of it.

We know not how far GOD may Imploy them, to <hi>ſpill the Blood</hi> of this People.
