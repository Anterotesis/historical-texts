            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE great buſineſs of human life, is to gain the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of corrupt deſires, and bring our hearts to the conſtant exerciſe of pure and holy ones: and this is the moſt honorable attainment any can expect to arrive to. Honor and happineſs mankind univerſally thirſt for; but the true idea of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> honor and happineſs are, is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways conceived of; nor is the right way to obtain it, univerſally adopted True honor and happineſs conſiſt in loving GOD and univerſal being, as themſelves.— Man's temper is naturally moroſe; and hatred is the ſpontaneous product; there are paſſionate feelings in men, which produce a kind of exerciſe called love; but it is a very different kind from what is required; it is often productive of diſgrace rather than honor, and pain rather than happineſs. GOD has in mercy wiſely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed means to ſoften and change men's tempers, and fit their hearts for tender and good affections; in order to leſſen the burdens of life and ſweeten its bitter ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, the inſtitution of MARRIAGE. which GOD has appointed, often has its beneficial effects upon the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and hearts of men; as well as in civil ſociety in gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral—and it is pronounced honorable for all perſons to attend to it—<hi>"It is not good for man to be alone—two are better than one, becauſe they have a good reward for their labour. And if one prevail againſt him, two ſhall withſtand him, and a threefold cord is not quickly broken."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND in all ages of the world, down to the preſent day, the greater part, yea almoſt all regular, well diſpoſed people, have made uſe of the inſtitution of Marriage; and the oſtenſible reaſon of GOD'S appointing it, was to preſerve purity of life and manners, render each ſex a comfort, bleſſing and joy to one another, by their mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al aid and friendſhip—continue a ſucceſſion of lives up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, and increaſe in numbers till time ſhall be no more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:049043_0004_10264C0B9542C3A8"/>MARRIAGE is honorable (undoubtedly) in its inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among all people: but to have people become an honor to it, and honored by it, depends upon their views in it, and right improvement of it. And now, that we may have a right underſtanding and proper views of the inſtitution of Marriage, and improve the preſent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion aright, the firſt object will be to ſhew what marriage is, ſecond, point out why marriage is honorable, and what views people ought to have in it; thirdly, attend to a few inferences and addreſſes from the ſubject.</p>

               </gap> contract, in which the parties give themſelves to each other; manifeſting their regard, affection and love. Marriage has been called by many a Civil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, in which a man and woman unite together for life. But I am rather inclined to think it ought to be called a Religious Contract from the comment CHRIST gave upon MOSES'S giving bills of divorce. — But, whatever people caſt it, civil or religious, it is an important and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting connection: and for this cauſe, GOD made them male and female and they leave father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and covenant together, and of twain become one. Covenants are of little <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſe for the ſafety and happineſs of the parties, unleſs they feel what they profeſs, and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe what they covenant. What makes covenants valid or beneficial to the parties, is having a real affection of heart one for the other, and the ſame views in each mind to act up to the ſpirit of the contract, and being united or one in their minds. The bleſſed Redeemer prayed that his diſciples and followers might be one with him, as he was one with the Father. There was a covenant between the Father and Son, in the work of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And Chriſt prayed for a oneneſs in his followers with him, knowing that if the ſame mind was in them which he p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in their hearts one for the other; and this makes Marriage delightful, and the connection ſweet, and lays a good foundation for comfort, while life ſhall laſt. But to know the heart and feel what we profeſs, is an import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant matter in all we tranſact, and ſtamps dignity upon what is done. But this leads me to the 2d head, viz. to ſhew why Marriage is honorable, and what views people ought to have in it—</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. MARRIAGE is honorable, in that it is beneficial and for the happineſs of individuals; but more eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the general good and uſe of the world; and as it is lawful in itſelf, both by civil and divine ſtatutes, it muſt be reputable and highly commendable for people to cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ebrate the ordinance. Having a benevolent, ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to do good; and a reſolute, active mind to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue it; and going on to do whatſoever our hands find to do, in our day and generation, by the will of GOD, is the great thing which really does, or ever ought to raiſe men's reputation, and make them honorable in the earth.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. MARRIAGE is honorable, becauſe GOD hath appointed it. Any thing which is appointed as the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of perfect wiſdom and goodneſs, muſt be an honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able appointment; and from what CHRIST relates in the 19th of Matthew, from the 4th to the 10th verſe, and the 10th of Mark, from the 6th to the 10th verſe—the words in both books are nearly the ſame—containing an anſwer to the cavilling Scribes—I will repeat the words in Mark; <hi>From the beginning of creation, God made them male and female. For this cauſe ſhall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife; and they twain ſhall be one fleſh; ſo then they are no more twain but one fleſh— What therefore God hath joined together, let no man put aſunder.</hi> And the inſpired Apoſtle in our text, ſays plainly, Marriage is honorable in all; and the bed unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed: but whoremongers and adulterers GOD will judge. I think it is plain GOD inſtituted Marriage from the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and ever meant it ſhould be practiſed; and it is honorable for all perſons to practiſe it; but irregular
<pb facs="unknown:049043_0007_10264C12B0664628"/>
connections, or unlawful, diſorderly unions between the ſexes, GOD will judge, and puniſh all who do not keep up to the ſtrict rules of decency and order. Order and decency are ever to be regarded in what people tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act; paſſionate feelings and irregular deſires, are not to have the reigns of government; GOD is a GOD of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and for people to do right in marrying, they ſhould enter into the Marriage covenant, with humble, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, believing hearts, rejoicing in the Divine Goodneſs, intending to ſerve GOD better, and be more extenſively uſeful in their day and generation—And hence, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the probable appearance of uſefulneſs and duty is greater by union, than to live ſingle, people ought to marry, and not otherwiſe. This was Paul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s way of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning upon the ſubject. <hi>Have I not a right to lead about a wife, or ſiſter, as other Apoſtles?</hi> It was lawful, but not expedient—for the then diſtreſſed ſtate of the Church, it was not beſt to marry—But marriage always was hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable in its inſtitution; and for the good of ſociety in general; but at ſome times it may not be expedient.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. WE now proceed to ſhew more particularly what views people ought to have in marrying. "Whatſoev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er we do, eat or drink, or whatſoever, we are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do all to the glory of GOD." Then it will follow, whether we marry or not, we muſt do all to the glory of GOD; live, not to ourſelves, but to him who died for us and roſe again. It is evident all thoughts, words and actions have a near connection with future happineſs or miſery—according to the words of our Bleſſed Saviour, <hi>For every idle word ſhall man give account thereof in the day of judgment.</hi> To be able to anſwer for our conduct hereafter, and act honorably in what we do, the thing we perform muſt be lawful, or right in its nature, and our intentions good in doing of it—To have right intentions in what we perform, the greateſt good muſt be aimed at. To pleaſe our own fancies, or gratify a ſelfiſh deſign is inconſiſtent with the character of an accountable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; to uſe the ordinance of marriage right, therefore,
<pb facs="unknown:049043_0008_10264C156AABC078"/>
it is as eſſentially neceſſary, that our deſign be to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy GOD, and not act with a view to pleaſe ourſelves, as in uſing any other ordinance. Whoever then would enter into the covenant of Marriage, and hope for a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine bleſſing in it, receive honor by it, and be an honor to it, muſt weigh well his circumſtances, whether it be lawful and expedient; if found to be, then are my views right in doing it; can I change my ſtate with a real de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and intention to ſerve and honor my Creator; and be more extenſively uſeful in the world? If I can do thus, underſtandingly, then Marriage, is honorable to a perſon, and the Divine deſign is complied with in it.</p>
            <p>MOSES, we read, for the hardneſs of men's hearts gave bills of divorce; but from the beginning it was not ſo. Perſons ought to act underſtandingly, and then live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in love; being married in the Lord, and never think of parting till death diſſolves the connection, and ſo ſanctify the ordinance, and it will be an honor to be married. But to do as ſome have done, form a paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, inconſiderate connection; and afterwards live in contention; ſuch diſhonor themſelves and the ordinance, and they had better not marry, than be guilty of ſuch an abuſe. Many ordinances, which are good in themſelves and appointed for the happineſs and benefit of people, are greatly diſhonored and abuſed, by the raſh, unruly deſires of thoſe, who ruſh into them without a right pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of heart.</p>
            <div type="improvement">
               <head>IMPROVEMENT.</head>
               <p n="1">1ſt. WE learn from our ſubject, that it is the duty of people, to have ſpecial and particular reference to the Divine Honor, in all their purſuits and actions of life; there is not any object which accountable creatures may purſue and pleaſe GOD, unleſs the ultimate end of the purſuit be the divine glory. This is evidently the caſe, in the uſe of all ordinances civil and religious. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of time, all favors, privileges, and mercies, muſt be received with gratitude; giving glory to GOD; and realizing our conſtant dependance for every bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:049043_0009_10263A386F5BB010"/>
and hence all inconſiderate, raſh, unmeaning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct is highly reprovable in all perſons. We ought to look well to the end of things in the beginning; ſee if poſſible what will be the following conſequences. But in an eſpecial manner, ſee to it that our motives are good, and our minds not blinded by ſelfiſh, corrupt deſires.— This is the way to have the eye ſingle, and the body full of light—And the way to be bleſſings in the world, and do good in our day and generation; perform that which is well pleaſing in the ſight of GOD, and lay up a good treaſure againſt the time to come.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. IS the divine glory and happineſs of man, the great object of purſuit, as has been ſhown, at which we all ought to aim? Let this ſubject call up our atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a thorough examination of ourſelves; and upon a ſtrict review of our intentions and conduct; we may eaſily learn, whether we are ſerving the great Creator, who is GOD over all, bleſſed forever; or the creature, which is idolatry. And this is an important matter, for us to know; for upon the acquiſition of this knowledge, happineſs or miſery will ſurely be the reſult. They who know they love GOD, go on with a cheerful heart to give glory to his name, and feel intereſted in the good of mankind; have a firm foundation laid, for comfort and increaſing felicity; becauſe there are no changes in the object of their hopes, the overflowing fountain of all goodneſs ever ſupplys them: and their hearts are eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, truſting in the Lord; being warmed, ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and comforted in their minds; are happy in the good ſervice of the Moſt High. While creature diſciples, or ſelfiſh idolaters, are purſuing after that which they never will find, and in chaſe of ſomething which does not exiſt, in the way they hope to overtake it. Miſery then muſt be the portion of all who truſt in earthly enjoyments. For earthly things were not made to ſatisfy immortal ſouls, or fill the place of ſpiritual enjoyments. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I diſmiſs this ſubject, permit me an addreſs upon the

preſent agreeable, important occaſion: the Celebration of Marriage.</p>
               <p>AND firſt, obſerve the ſcenes we are now acting are ſwiftly paſſing away. Marriage is a temporal bleſſing; but ſoon we ſhall be beyond ſuch ſcenes as this. The greateſt of inſtructors has told us, that in the future ſtate there is neither marriage, nor giving in marriage; but regenerated ſouls, ſhall be as Angels of God in heaven, i. e. nothing of this temporary bodily marriage we now uſe; but an holy union of ſoul with Chriſt; and all holy beings, and all ſuch as love and ſerve GOD here, ſhall ſit down at the Marriage Supper there. And now may it not be highly proper, to query with ourſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who have been and are about to paſs the ſcene of temporary Marriage—are we ſpiritually married to Chriſt? and do we all love, and endeavor to live upon, and act up to, the Covenant of Grace, as required of us in the Bible? or do we live in the world together like heirs of the grace of life? It is truly important, to fulfil the Law of Love, and ſeek to promote each others happineſs; and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to encourage one another in the duties of Chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. To have the privilege of living together, in the world, in the mutual exerciſe of love and friendſhip; bearing one another's burden, aſſiſting and comforting in all the cares and trials of life; is not a ſmall favour. But to dwell together in the other world, as Angels of Light, is an infinitely grater favour; and if we love not our wives, huſbands, and brethren, and dwell not toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with them in love, whom we have ſeen; how can we expect we love GOD, whom we have not ſeen? or that we ſhall dwell together in the eternal world, and be happy? O then let us all try to do right; and wherev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er there are any wrong feelings of heart, ſuppreſs them; or a want of love, let it ſpring up and grow; as expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Coloſſans 3.18. <hi>Huſbands love your wives, and be not bitter againſt them; and ye wives, ſubmit yourſelves unto your own huſbands, as is fit in the Lord.</hi>
