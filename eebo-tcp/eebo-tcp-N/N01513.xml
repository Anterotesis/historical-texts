            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ANSWER To what has been offer'd as Argument againſt the Validity and Force of an Act of Aſſembly, Entituled, <hi>An Act that the Solemn Affirmation and Declaration of the People called</hi> Quakers, &amp;c. Paſſed in the Province of <hi>New-Jerſey,</hi> in the 13<hi>th</hi> Year of the Reign of Queen <hi>Anne.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WHEREAS there has been of late an Objection, without any Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in Law or Reaſon, ſtarted againſt the People call'd <hi>Quakers,</hi> their being Imploy'd in any Places or Poſts of Profit or Truſt in this Province; which Objection, in my Opinon, has a Tendency of no leſs Conſequence than the rendring the Municipal Laws thereof of no Force or Effect for the Future, and Subverting the Civil Government; I have Judg'd it Neceſſary for the Satisfaction of the Minds of the Scrupulous, and Stopping the Mouths of the Clamorous and Siditious, until a more Effectual Method may be purſu'd, if Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to require, to ſet that Affair in ſo clear a light, that the Half-ſighted may See, and the half-witted be Convinced of the Unreaſonableneſs and Abſurdity of that Objection. The reſt can ſee and underſtand without my Help.</p>
            <p>The whole Force of their Objection Leans upon this. <hi>There is,</hi> ſay they, <hi>an Act paſſed in</hi> Great Britain, <hi>in the Firſt Year of His Majesties Reign, Entituled,</hi> An Act for making Perpetual an Act of the 7<hi>th</hi> and 8<hi>th</hi> Years of the Reign of his late Majeſty King <hi>William the Third, Entituled,</hi> An Act that The Solemn Affirmation and Declaration of the People call'd <hi>Quakers</hi> ſhall be accepted in ſtead of an Oath in the uſual Form, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Act of the firſt of King <hi>George</hi> Extends that Act of King <hi>Williams</hi> to the Plantations, by the laſt Clauſe in it, in theſe Words,
<q>
                  <hi>Provided always,</hi> That ſo much of <hi>this</hi> Act as Relates to the Affirmations to be made by the People call'd <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſhall be Extended to that Part of <hi>Great Britain</hi> call'd <hi>Scotland,</hi> forever, and to the Plantations belonging to the Crown of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> for Five Years, and to the end of the next Seſſion of Parliament after the ſaid Five Years, and no longer.</q>
And that Act of King <hi>William</hi> has in it the following Clauſe,
<q>
                  <hi>Provided, and be it Enacted,</hi> That no <hi>Quaker</hi> or reputed <hi>Quaker</hi> ſhall BY VIRTUE OF THIS ACT, be qualified or permited to give Evidence in any Criminal Cauſes, or Serve on any Jury's, or bear any Office or place of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit in the Government, any thing in THIS ACT contained to the Contrary not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding.</q>
               <hi>Now,</hi> ſay they, <hi>The Law past in this Province ſome time ago for qualifiing That People for Places of Profit and Truſt, is by that of the firſt of King</hi> George, <hi>above mentioned, Repealed and of no longer Force, and Conſequently</hi> Quakers <hi>can no longer enjoy Places of Profit,</hi> &amp;c. This is all that has come to my Ears upon this head that has the Appearance of any Meaning in it.</p>
            <p>And firſt, I ſhall obſerve in General, into what a woeful Condition muſt the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations be Plung'd, if ſuch Laws as ſhall by a Legiſlature, I awfully Conſtituted by virtue of the Letters Pattent, under the broad Seal, be Enacted for the Good
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001796_0002_0FB832B591357CB0"/>
Government and Eaſe of the Subjects there, ſhall by Implication or Conſtruction, he deemed to be Repealed upon the Suggeſtion of any petty Attorney who ſhall or may affirm for Excuſe, that he may ſay what he thinks fit for the Benefit of his Clyent.</p>
            <p>But in the next place, That Act of Aſſembly is not ſo much as by Implication Repealed; for the Words in that Act upon which they lay the ſtreſs of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are theſe, "<hi>Provided,</hi> That no <hi>Quaker</hi> ſhall by Virtue of <hi>THIS</hi> Act, be Qualified, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now, I know no Quaker that pretends that he is or can by Virtue of THAT Act be qualified, but I believe every Quaker thinks that he is or may be qualified <hi>by Virtue of an Act of Aſſembly,</hi> Entituled, <hi>An Act that the Solemn Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and Declaration of the People called</hi> Quakers, &amp;c. paſſed in this Province, and ſent home for the approbation of the Soveraign above two Years ago, and for any thing I have heard to the contrary, Approv'd and Ratify'd. It is as plain as Words can make it, that <hi>That</hi> Act of the 7<hi>th</hi> and 8<hi>th</hi> of King <hi>VVilliam</hi> has <hi>No Negative</hi> but upon it ſelf, and Conſequently cannot be alledged in Bar to any Laws already Enacted in the Plantations, or even ſuch as may be Enacted; for by theſe Letters Patent, which give a being to this Government and Legiſlature, all ſuch Laws as ſhall be Enacted by the Governour, Council and Aſſembly, are declared to be in Full Force from the time of Enacting. The Governour, indeed, by his Inſtructions is Commanded
<q>Not to give his A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ent to any Bills of Unuſual and Extaordinary Nature and Importance, wherein the Prerogative Royal of the Crown, or the Property of the Subject may be prejudiced, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe all Laws enacted there, are in Force from the time of Enacting; and if he Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſes in this point, He is accountable for it.</q>
But the Law in Queſtion is ſo far from the Suſpition of being of that Nature, that it is exactly conformable to the Governours Inſtructions, and what he had in Command from the Soveraign, in the following words, being the 60<hi>th</hi> and 61<hi>st</hi> Inſtruction to him under the Queens hand and Seal,</p>
            <q>AND Whereas We have been Informed that divers of our good Subjects In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting thoſe parts do make a Religious Scruple of Swearing, and by reaſon of their Refuſal to take an Oath in Courts of Juſtice, and other places, are or may be lyable to many Inconveniencys, <hi>Our Will and Pleaſure is,</hi> that in Order to their eaſe in what they conceive to be matter of Conſcience, ſo far as may be conſiſtent with good Order and Government, you take care that an Act be paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the General Aſſembly of our ſaid Province to the like Effect as that paſt here in the 7<hi>th</hi> and 8<hi>th</hi> Year of his late Majeſtys Reign, Entituled <hi>An Act that the Solemn Affirmation and Declaration of the People called</hi> Quakers, <hi>ſhall be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted inſtead of an Oath in the uſual Form,</hi> and that the ſame be tranſmitted to Us, and to our Commiſſioners of Trade and Plantations, as before directed. And whereas We have been further informed, That in the firſt Settlement of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our ſaid Plantation, it may ſo happen that the Number of Inhabitants fitly qualified to Serve in our Council, of the General Aſſembly, and in <hi>other Places of Trust or Profit there,</hi> will be but ſmall, it is therefore <hi>Our Will and Pleaſure,</hi> that ſuch of the ſaid People called Quakers as ſhall be ſound capable of any of thoſe Places or Imployments, and accordingly be Elected or appointed to Serve therein, may, upon their taking and ſigning the Declaration of Allegiance to Us, in the Form uſed by the ſame People in this Kingdom, together with a Solemn De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration for the true Diſcharge of their reſpective Truſts, be admitted by you into any of the ſaid Places or Imployments.</q>
            <p>Which Inſtructions are contained alſo in His preſent Majeſtys Inſtructions to the Governor, dated at <hi>St. James</hi>'s the Firſt Day of <hi>July,</hi> 1715. word for word.</p>

               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:001796_0003_0FB832BDCD9D32F0"/>To Sum up the whole I do Affirm, That an Act of Aſſembly, entituled, <hi>An Act that the Solemn Affirmation and Declaration of the People called</hi> Quakers, &amp;c. paſs'd in the laſt Aſſembly of this Province, ſtands in Full Force and Vigour, being paſſed by the Soveraigns eſpecial Command, not having been Diſallowed or Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the Soveraign, nor Repealed or made void by any ſubſequent Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament or Aſſembly; And that by virtue of that Act, <hi>Quakers</hi> or reputed Quakers, when duly qualified as that Act directs, are capable of Offices of Profit and Truſt in this Province; and that the aſſerting or affirming the contrary, ſerves only to open a Gap to Pretenders to Law, to plead againſt the Validity of any or all your Municiple Laws, when either their Selfiſh Views or perverſe Purpoſes may ſuggeſt to them ſo very Ridiculous and Abſurd a Notion, and to weaken (as I verily believe it is intended) the Adminiſtration, and Unhinge or Diſſolve the Government in this part of the Province, where it was firſt openly and avowedly Aſſerted.</p>

At that time (as I ſuppoſe it was intended) it gave me ſome Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, and coming from a private hand at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> printed on a ſmall ſingle Sheet, in no Statute Book of publick Laws, from no Board of Trade, Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of State, or other Officer or Miniſter directed to the Governour of either this or the Neighbouring Province, the Opinion which I then gave, was, That as yet I could not take any Notice of it as a publick Law, nor give my Opinion upon it, being only a Preſumptive Evidence of the being of ſuch Law. And there being a Poſitive notorious Act of Aſſembly of this Province for Qualifying the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> to ſerve on Jurys of all Sorts (except in Criminal Cauſes) on that Affirmation, I did Order the Secretary to qualify them accordingly, which (contrary to his Duty) he poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively Refuſed to do, by means whereof, we had no Grand Jury this laſt Term, I did pronounce him in Contempt of the Court, and Impoſed a Fine upon him for this Contempt. And now having better conſidered of the Subſtance and Intent of this Law or Statute, I am fully prepared to give my Opinion thereof, with relation to the Inhabitants of this Diviſion who are Quakers or reputed Quakers. My firſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation is, That this Paragraph of the Statute is only Negative of it ſelf; for the Words are, Provided and be it Enacted, That no Ouaker or reputed Quaker ſhall by virtue of <hi>This</hi> Act be Qualified or permitted to give Evidence in any Criminal Cauſes or ſerve on any Jurys, or bear any Office or place of Profit in the Government, any thing in This Act contained to the contrary in any ways notwithſtanding. Then again, this Act of Parliament of <hi>Great Britain</hi> is an Enlargement of the Quaker Privieldge to what it never was before, It makes that perpetual to them in <hi>England,</hi> which before was Temporary, and expired or near expiring by its own Limitation; Carrys the ſame into that part of <hi>Great Britain</hi> called <hi>Scotland,</hi> where it was not before, and makes it perpetual there; and into the Plantations generally for Five Years. This does no ways hinder, but that by virtue of the Act of Aſſembly of this Province, which is a Municipal Law thereof, the Quakers or reputed Quakers are qualified to be of Jurys, and Evidence, and bear Offices of Truſt and Profit in the Government; nor but that they may be ſo qualified hereafter by any other Law hereafter to be made for that or the like purpoſe, Although by virtue of <hi>That</hi> Act of Parliament they are not ſo qualified.</p>
            <p>It is true, there are other inhabitants in <hi>Burlington,</hi> who profeſs themſelves to be of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> as by Law eſtabliſhed; and it were to be wiſhed they were more numerous, and better diſpoſed towards the Government thereof, under the beſt of Princes, and a prudent and well deſerving Governour, who bears the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Marks of his Majeſtys Royal Favour. Can any of theſe ſay, that whilſt they behaved themſelves well, they were denyed to have the Oathes adminiſtred to them

in due Form of Law, and their Priviledges? The promiſcuous Return of both ſorts upon the Sheriffs Pannels to ſerve on Grand Jurys, with the Differences of Parties, has been an Occaſion of great Obſtruction to the Courts of Judicature, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding my frequent Admonitions to the contrary. I am not altogether ignorant of the Authors of thoſe Diſturbances, having been preſent at <hi>Burlington</hi> the greateſt part of the time of that Seſſion of Aſſembly, when that Law, in Favour of the Quakers, was in Framing; the pretended Zeal for the Church, and its ſuppoſed and Imaginary Danger, with the humour of new invented Diſtinctions, run to a very great Height, ſo that ſome Perſons ſeemed to be almoſt diſpoſed to a total Contempt of Government, and Rebellion. I ſhall forbear naming Perſons in hopes that theſe ill humours are evaporated and at an end; I do beſeech you to be at the pains to read that Grave and ſage Advice given by his Grace the moſt Reverend Father in God <hi>Thomas</hi> late Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the other Right Honourable the Lords Biſhops then in and about <hi>London,</hi> of the 3<hi>d</hi> of <hi>November</hi> laſt, in their printed Declaration, and conſider whether it is not worthy of all our Regard and Obedience. Theſe groundleſs and ſubtil Diſtinctions and Jealouſies, which of late had like to bring the State and Conſtitution of the Government into Danger, are now over in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> By the bleſſing of God upon his Majeſtys Arms, and his prudent Conduct; Let them not Survive here; Let us for the future Reſovle to lay aſide all bitter Envying and Stri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Why ſhall Moderation and <hi>Chriſtian Charity</hi> be laid aſide as Uſeleſs, Anti-chriſtian and Heterodox, and <hi>Envy, Hatred</hi> and <hi>Malice</hi> paſs upon us for Zeal and Religion!</p>
            <p>I do underſtand the Grand Jury of <hi>Burlington,</hi> at the laſt General Seſſions of the Peace, after an Unpreſidented manner, have found an Indictment againſt Me, for what I have done in the Execution of my Office upon the Bench, in <hi>November</hi> laſt, as alſo Indictments againſt ſome other Perſons of Figure and Diſtinction in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; Were it an Offence only againſt me Perſonally, I thank God, I could paſs it by without the leaſt Reſentment; (I am ready to believe they were none of their own Framing, eſpecially that againſt my Self,) but as it is an open Affront put upon me, as I repreſent the Kings Perſon, it deſerves Correction. The Law does not ſuppoſe that a Judge is Infallible, and therefore he is not accountable in Law for a Miſtake in his Opinion; and in many caſes the Judges of <hi>England</hi> are of different Opinions. And the Law provides well for the Support of the Dignity of ſuch Perſons as do repreſent his Majeſty in the Office of Adminiſtration of Juſtice. The Judgment for Striking in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall, &amp;c.</hi> ſiting the Courts, is, That the Offender ſhall be Impriſoned during his Life, Forfeit all his Lands, Tenements, Goods and Chatte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s, and that his Right Hand be cut off at ſuch a place; Which Judgment is given by the Common Law. It is one of the ſpecies of High-Treaſon to Kill and Murder a Juſtice of either Bench, in their Places doing their Offices. If any Man in <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-Hall,</hi> or in any other place, ſitting the Courts of Chancery, Exchequer, the Kings Bench, the Common-Pleas, or before Juſtice of Aſſize, or of Oyer and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner, ſhall draw a Weapon againſt any Judge or Juſtice, though he ſtrike not, this is a great Miſpriſon, for the which he shall looſe his Right Hand, and Forfeit his Lands and Goods, and his Body to perpetual Impriſonment.

the Offence (which is the occaſion of this Diſcourſe) above what it is, but to ſhow you, That as in theſe Higher Crimes againſt his Majeſties Juſtices upon the Bench, doing their Offices, an extraordinary Puniſhment is to be inflicted, ſo in ſmaller Offences committed againſt them, for the doing of their Duty in their Offices, the Law will proportionably require a ſharper Reproof, than for the like Offences againſt Perſons in a private Capacity. I shall not take upon my ſelf to direct this Puniſhment, but cannot think that any of thoſe Perſons, who were of that Grand Jury, can properly ſerve in that Truſt again, until they ſhall make Ranſom for that Offence, which I ſincerely deſire may be Moderated, being inclineable to believe, That none of them did compoſe thoſe Preſentments, and that they were prepared to their hands.</p>

               <head>The Charge to the Grand Jury at <hi>Burlington,</hi> the Firſt Day of <hi>May, 1716.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Would have introduced my Charge this time to the Grand Jury, by ſaying ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what concerning the Neceſſity and Uſefulneſs of Government, and what a great ſhare of our <hi>Chriſtian Duty</hi> it is, to be ſubject and Obedient thereunto, and to Support it. It is a thing ſo well known, that few will offer to diſpute it, yet ſo little regarded by many, makes it neceſſary to be mentioned and urged. It is a thing ſo Copious, more might eaſily be ſaid on that head, than my Time will now permit; <hi>I</hi> ſhall therefore confine my ſelf to that nervous and ſollid Argument of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> writing to the <hi>Romans,</hi> who had imbraced the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and lived under the Obedience and Government of <hi>Heathen</hi> Rulers and Magiſtrates, <hi>chap.</hi> 13. from <hi>ver.</hi> 1. to <hi>v.</hi> 8.
<q>Let every Soul be ſubject to the Higher Powers, for there is no Power but of God; the Powers that be are ordained of God; Whoſoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſiſteth the Power, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God, and they that reſiſt, ſhall receive to themſelves Damnation; For Rulers are not a Terror to good Works, but to the Evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the Power? do that which is good and thou ſhalt have praiſe of the ſame; for he is the Miniſter of God to thee for good; but if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the Sword in vain; for he is the Miniſter of God, a Revenger to execute Wrath upon him that doth evil. Wherefore ye muſt needs be ſubject, not only for Wrath, but alſo for Conſcience ſake; for for this cauſe pay we Tribute alſo; for they are Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters attending continually on this very thing. Render therefore to all their Dues, Tribute to whom Tribute is due; Cuſtom to whom Cuſtom; Fear to whom Fear; Honour to whom Honour.</q>
St. <hi>Peter</hi> writing to the Strangers who had imbraced the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> in his firſt general Epiſtle, was of the ſame Mind, his words are.
<q>Submit your ſelves to every Ordinance of Man for the Lords ſake, whether it be to the King as Supreme, or to Governours, as unto them that are ſent by him, for the Puniſhment of evil Doers, and for the Praiſe of them that do well; for ſo is the Will of God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Health and very Life of Government conſiſts in the due Execution of the Laws, and this is the Prerogative of the Crown, and this the King does by his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Officers, who do repreſent his Perſon, in the due Execution of their Offices; Without this the Law is but a dead Letter. And it is for this end we are now met here. And for that we are Judges of Record, by the order of the Laws,

we cannot take Knowledge of Offences without the Information of others, and therefore, by the Kings Authority, you are called together here, according to antient Practice in <hi>England,</hi> and the former Uſage, as Men, who by common intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, do know ſuch Offences, as we have power to deal withal, committed within the ſeveral places of your Habitations in the County of <hi>Burlington.</hi> Let there be no more Strife and Diſ-uniting amongſt you, on the ſcore of that mixture of Perſons which the Law has allowed to ſerve. Thoſe who have taken the <hi>Affirmation</hi> are by that Law as much oblig'd as any <hi>ſworn</hi> in the moſt Solemn manner, and are under the ſame Penalties. And however the ſame may be variouſly underſtood, it is certain they be thereby qualified to ſerve on Grand Jurys; and if any Number of ſuch, upon their Enquity, being Atteſted, do agree to the Truth of what others do agree to Preſent, upon their Oaths, where is the Injury or Prejudice to the Verdict of thoſe who are Sworn? Is the Preſentment the leſs True, becauſe the others do Affirm it to be True, and that <hi>in the Preſence of God, and upon the Penalty of Perjury?</hi> You who have taken an Oath upon the holy Contents of that Book, do take upon you a Vow of great Importance, which ought to be ſeriouſly weighed and conſidered; For in the Book are contained, not only the Comfortable Promiſes of Almighty God, to thoſe that Serve and Fear him, but alſo the heavy Wrath and Fearful iudgments denounced againſt Impenitent Sinners, Falſe Swearers, and ſuch as d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
