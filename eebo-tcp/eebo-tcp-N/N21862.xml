            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TESTIMONY, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE queſtion of "Peace or War," has now been twice agitated in the Senate, ſince the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the preſent ſeſſion: and whatever may have been the deciſion in thoſe aſſemblies, the diſcuſſion is ſtill open before the tribunal of the Public. It was undoubtedly my duty, if I thought I could throw any new light on the ſubject, to have delivered my ſentiments in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I was prepared to do ſo, and very anxious to obtain a hearing —Gentlemen who ſaw me repeatedly riſe for that purpoſe; and ſtill more, the Speaker, to whom I verbally communicated my wiſhes, cannot but bear witneſs, of my intention.—Compelled however, by circumſtances, to involuntary ſilence in that quarter, I muſt now diſcharge my conſcience through my pen.— Here therefore I moſt unreſervedly publiſh my opinion, That <hi>reſolutely to perſiſt in offenſive War, is not the beſt method of procuring Peace.</hi>—</p>
            <p>Our objections to treating with the preſent French Government are ſtated to be, becauſe it is too diſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant not to be ſuſpected of inſtability, and too recent to afford any aſſurance of permanency. In all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, the arguments in favour of Peace are clearly on the ſide of Oppoſition; and it only remains to decide, whether for the bare chance of unſteadineſs or verſality in the actual adminiſtration of France we are content to ſee almoſt the whole world peopled with nothing but ſoldiers; and every eſtabliſhed form of government in Europe, not excepting our own, go to wreck in the conteſt. That this muſt inevitably happen, unleſs the French be induced by general pacification to lay down their arms, no man who coolly conſiders the nature of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028790_0005_0FDD45C489EBA858"/>
their revolutionary ſyſtem can well venture to deny. I ſhall ſay nothing of the arguments founded on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of our retaining the French colonies in caſe of a peace, as a neceſſary indemnification for our enormous expences; becauſe I think they have not a ſhadow of juſtice or good faith to ſupport them. Had we ſtood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in the conflict, the doctrine would have been plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible enough; but connected as we are and have been with various allies, each ſtriving with all his ſtrength, <hi>as we are told,</hi> and many beyond their ſtrength, in the common cauſe, the conqueſts made by any individual member of the alliance cannot poſſibly be viewed in any other light than as prizes taken by a ſingle ſhip at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to a fleet. The whole of the capture muſt be thrown into the general maſs, and ſhould ſerve, as far as it will go, to balance the partnerſhip-account of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and loſs. If politics and good faith do not always go hand in hand, I am heartily ſorry for the country where they are ſeparated. But that conduct which, in my private ſituation, I hold to be eſſentially wrong, I ſhall not henceforth, in my public capacity, ſupport as conditionally right; for that we ſhould at all times, and under all circumſtances, profeſs a readineſs to <hi>treat with all our enemies whomſoever,</hi> I deem to be an indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable obligation of the religion to which we have all ſworn obedience at our baptiſm. Whatever opinions men might have formed of the juſtice and neceſſity of this war at its commencement, the ground has been ſo completely ſhifted ſince that period, as to authoriſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſentiments of the propriety of its farther continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and to require new modes of conduct for its ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. The ſituation and circumſtances of all the great powers of Europe are entirely changed from what they were only two years ago; and if this be the caſe already, it behoves us ſeriouſly to conſider, not merely the effect of this change at the preſent moment, but what progreſs it may be likely to make, up to any fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture given period: and at what time, or by what means, we may flatter ourſelves with a more favourable oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028790_0006_0FDD45C7F9436C80"/>
for concluding hoſtilities. If we reaſon from paſt experience, the advantages in ſtore for us are not very inviting; and it is incumbent on miniſterial logic to demonſtrate how the uniform ſucceſſes of the French Republic ſhould augment our expectations of its ſpeedy overthrow. But in the courſe of the preſent conteſt, France has not only beaten our allies, ſhe ſeems alſo to have made converts of them to her cauſe; for I believe there is not a man well informed of what is paſſing on the Continent, who will not readily agree that the French are leſs obnoxious to the ſubjects of every one of the Belligerent Powers than their own haughty purſe-proud confederates the Engliſh. The conſequences of this general diſeſteem under which we labour, I leave to be computed by ſuperior adepts in political arithmetic: to my underſtanding, their groſs amount is diſaſter, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugation, and ruin. It is not a little extraordinary to obſerve the very ſame grounds of argument preſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſervice of two oppoſite parties, to ſupport two contrary concluſions—Adminiſtration contends, from the very victories of the French, that they are too ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant to laſt: Oppoſition maintains, from the rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated defeats of the allies, that they are too much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to recover. Here then we come directly to the point at iſſue. Does the preſent political ſtate of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope authoriſe our perſeverance in hoſtilities, or warrant the neceſſity of immediate pacification.</p>
            <p>O for a peep into futurity! may the plain obſerver allowably exclaim,—A peep into futurity? Pictures, indeed of the period to come, are exhibited to us by both ſides of the queſtion; but who ſhall certify the ability of the painter, and who ſhall vouch for the fidelity of the portrait?</p>
            <p>It has always been obſerved, that times of calamity are peculiarly fertile in viſions and prognoſtications, predictions and prophecies. When the minds of men are ſoftened by the preſſure or the apprehenſion of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulating evils, then is the moment for the ſalutary warnings of the internal monitor, and the cautionary
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028790_0007_0FDD45C9D9B469F0"/>
voice of the ſpiritual guide. The great maſs of the people, too ſore with their ſufferings not to graſp at any offer of conſolation, and too credulous to form ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate notions of the divinity of its origin, is eaſily worked upon by every ſpecies of oracular pretenſion: and we all know, that when men are once ſteadily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded of the authenticity of a prophecy, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt involuntarily led to perform their part towards its completion. The preſent moment teems with theſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipations of futurity, beyond the example of every former period. Unfortunately, whatever be the deſigns or merits of the various diſſeminators of theſe oracles, they are at leaſt uniform in the melancholy ſtrain of their predictions: and it behoves every well-regulated government to attend minutely to the irritation theſe forbodings may produce on the public mind. For if their doctrines be well founded, we have not an inſtant to loſe in adopting a complete reverſion both of our moral and political ſyſtem: if they be fallacious, no pains ſhould be ſpared to undeceive the victims of their impoſition, and no puniſhment can be too ſevere for the atrocious criminality of their propagators.</p>
            <p>Among the productions to which I allude, there is not one ſo general in its circulation, nor a thouſandth part ſo forcible in its delineations of approaching miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as the two pamphlets intitled <q>A revealed Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Prophecies and Times, and particularly of the preſent Time, the preſent War, and the Prophecy now fulfilling, wrote by the command of Almighty God, and publiſhed by Richard Brothers</q>— an author whoſe tremendous threats and unqualified anathemas fulminate dethronement and ſpeedy death on almoſt every one of the Sovereigns of Europe by name, and particularly on our own beloved monarch. Nor is he leſs liberal of his violent menaces againſt both our hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of parliament, our civil and eccleſiaſtical eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the city of London, and the whole Britiſh nation: and all this, too, in terms preciſely ſuited to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the moſt ordinary capacity: replete with
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028790_0008_0FDD45CE3AF1A538"/>
grammatical faults; deſtitute alike of harmony of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement, and elegance of diction; in the ſtyle of a peaſant, exalting himſelf above the mightieſt of princes: affirming, that he is utterly invulnerable to all human power; and braving, with the moſt unruffled indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that government, whoſe authority his doctrines and deſtination are by himſelf declared to counteract, and whoſe eſtabliſhment the completion of his miſſion muſt neceſſarily ſubvert.</p>
            <p>What ſhall we ſay or think of a man who has been in the habit of writing letters to the King, the Queen, and the Miniſters of State, ever ſince the beginning of 1792; foretelling many events that would afterwards, ſome of which have actually already come to paſs; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing or reproving them as occaſion ſeemed to him to require, in peremptory and dictatorial meſſages, ſaid to proceed from God himſelf; and perſiſting, though in the moſt unaffected mediocrity of private life, to reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate his intruſions, and reinforce his remonſtrances, on each new viciſſitude of public events: nay more, who ſteps forth to the world, in a ſturdy publication, avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all he has done, and telling to whom, on what ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, in what manner, and how often he has repeated this extraordinary correſpondence: and makes the whole Engliſh nation a ſort of umpire between the conſtituted power of the State, and one obſcure Individual?</p>
            <p>The policy of Government, however, has, I believe, hitherto left himſelf and his publications, to riſe or fall by their own merits; and he has been brought to trial, only by a very ſubordinate tribunal indeed: only a ſix-penny ſpouting club! which ſome time ago, propoſed, as a topic for debate, Whether Richard Brothers, who calls himſelf God Almighty's Nephew, be an impoſtor or a madman?—overlooking, probably, as is often the caſe with very eager diſputants, a third poſſibility in the ſubject, namely, that he was neither the one, nor the other.</p>
            <p>The books which I have here brought forward, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſumething more than that mere <hi>peep into futurity</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:028790_0009_0FDD45D28D976E60"/>
for which I lately expreſſed ſo anxious a deſire. They pretend to be, particularly the ſecond, an abſtract of the brief chronicle of the future fortunes of all Europe. But an abſtract, no doubt, may be incorrect; and a chronicle can be conceived totally wanting in authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. To fix theſe imputations on the preſent work, nothing more is neceſſary than to adopt the pithy deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſpouting club, that Richard Brothers muſt be either impoſtor or madman. To ſupport the firſt propoſition, we muſt neceſſarily diſcover ſome private intereſt, ſome perſonal gratification, ſome premeditated deception, lurking under the plauſible pretenſions of philanthropy and piety: the ſecond can only be fully made out by ſome proof of glaring inconſiſtency in his profeſſions: and in both theſe particulars I hold him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely ſuperior to all imputation. Uprightneſs of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and candour of ſoul, breathe through every line of his compoſition. But in vouching for his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, I do not, <hi>à priori,</hi> conclude his infallibility. I can only ſay, that if it were poſſible he ſhould deceive others, I am morally certain, from the internal evidence of his whole work, that he is himſelf the firſt victim of the deception. On what criterion then ſhall we decide his merits? to what authority ſhall we appeal? His own anſwer is, <q>
                  <hi>Search the Scriptures yourſelves.</hi> As Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, You <hi>muſt</hi> acknowledge them to be the perfect ſources of all veracity, <hi>and let them be the touchſtone of my aſſertions.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Here let us pauſe for a moment, and reflect, that if we take him at his word, we are once more conſigned to the myſterious depths of Daniel, Eſdras, and of the Revelations, where ſo many ingenious interpreters, and athletic commentators, have been already ſhipwrecked. How ſhall we ſcape a ſimilar calamity? If it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on this ſea ever to make a ſafe harbour, we muſt certainly ſtrike out ſome new courſe, and take for our compaſs the following conſiderations on the nature and properties of prophetic writing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:028790_0010_0FDD45D397271020"/>All prophecies are neither more nor leſs than true genuine aenigmas, in which the meaning is ſo nicely and artificially enveloped by ambiguity of ſenſe and of expreſſion, that until we be furniſhed by the inventor himſelf with the proper clue to unravel them, they are calculated to appear as a tiſſue of the moſt incongruent abſurdities. Of theſe prophetical compoſitions, ſome are compact and cloſe, like the greater part of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan oracles, and others more copious and diffuſe. In the former caſe, every word, I had almoſt ſaid every letter, comes in for its ſhare of meaning; and the key that does not preciſely fit every one of them is good for nothing. No allowance is to be admitted for any thing ſuperabundant or extraneous. In the longer compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions a greater latitude prevails: among ſeveral ſentences, or diſtinct members of one ſentence, the meaning is all contained in a ſingle phraſe only, which is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued with all the minute preciſion and undeviating conſiſtency required in the former caſe, while the other parts are only thrown in to miſlead the obſerver. Juſt as if the real objects to be repreſented in a picture were ſoftened down, melted away, and obſcured in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances of the back ground, while the prominent features of the deſign, that occupy the front of the canvas, ſhould be formed of adventitious or frivolous repreſentations, of no conſequence or neceſſity to the piece. Inſtances of both kinds will occur as we proceed; and frequent ſpecimens of each may be found in the different prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Old Teſtament, which are acknowledged by all ſound critics and expoſitors to allude to the coming and ſufferings of the Meſſiah.</p>
            <p>In this place it may not be ſuperfluous to mention, that in the occupation of decyphering myſterious and allegorical modes of compoſition, I am far from being undiſciplined. If I have been rather negligent of our own ſacred writings, I have at leaſt been in the habit of beſtowing unwearied attention on thoſe of the old Hindús; writings not widely diſſimilar in ſtyle and manner from the prophetical treatiſes in our own Bible.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028790_0011_0FDD45D8DF8AD828"/>
Nor have my reſearches been altogether fruitleſs, ſince I have been fortunate enough to diſcover the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing couched under the Hindú triad of Energies or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, called Brahma, Viſhnu, and Shiva, which I affirm to be nothing more than poetical perſonifications of <hi>matter, ſpace,</hi> and <hi>time,</hi> and I ſay, that by the proper application of theſe three terms, all the ſurviving re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of genuine Brachmanical mythology may be truly elucidated.</p>
            <p>Fortified therefore with this pre-acquired aptitude for ſuch ſtudies, I ſat down with pleaſure to the taſk re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by Mr. Brothers, namely, to read the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern hiſtory of Europe in the prophetic records of the Old and New Teſtament.</p>
            <p>For this purpoſe, nothing was requiſite, but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, by the teſt of human ſagacity, whether the clue furniſhed by him were in groſs and in all its parts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly commenſurate to the whole tenor and purport of the myſteries to be unraveled; for if it failed in any one particular, or were found too long or too ſhort in its application to any one inſtance—<hi>actum eſſet de toto</hi>— The works of God are all without flaw; and for this clue to poſſeſs that degree of perfection, it muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily have proceeded from God himſelf, who conſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the viſions of the prophecies at firſt, to the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that they never ſhould become intelligible, until, at the time deſtined by his holy will and pleaſure, the true <hi>mot de l'aenigme</hi> ſhould be revealed to his creatures; and when once this clue ſhould come to be known, any man whatever, with a competent ſhare of learning and induſtry, might comprehend and expound all the ſecrets to which it applies, as well as the very man to whom it was originally imparted.</p>
            <p>To make this point more intelligible, I ſhall obſerve, that with reſpect to the four beaſts in the viſion of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel (and the ſame in any other caſe) it might happen, and probably has happened, that ſome man or other ſhould form a very probable gueſs as to the meaning of a ſingle beaſt, or even two. But what has never been
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028790_0012_0FDD45DA3B9AA6D8"/>
done, and what never could have been done, but by direct revelation from God, is to find a key, one and indiviſible, that ſhould apply perfectly and equally well to all the four: ſo that taking each of them ſeverally, or the whole in a maſs, the true meaning ſhould be no leſs perſpicuous aad palpable in their union than in their ſeparation. And ſo with regard to the Babylon mentioned in the Revelations. The Portrait of Rome is ſo evident in that part where Rome is really meant, that not a ſingle commentator of the hundreds who have handled the paſſage has ever once miſtaken it. But they have all erred in ſuppoſing that Babylon univerſally, and in all caſes, ſignified the ſame Rome: and I have no doubt, but that very clear and intelligible deſcription of Rome in one place, was expreſsly inſerted for the ſole purpoſe of miſguiding, and putting to fault, their conjectures on other parts of the prophecy, where a different city is alluded to under the ſame title. And this is agreeable to the ordinary conduct of God's providence towards mankind. He has not totally denied them light; but the ray which he has graciouſly imparted to them, only ſerves to lead them aſtray, if they for a moment give looſe to the wanderings of their own imaginations.</p>
            <p>This then is the queſtion:—Has Richard Brothers poſſeſſion of this clue, and has he declared it in his book? I anſwer, Yes; becauſe I am ſure I found it there. But at the ſame time, I affirm, he makes very little uſe of it, becauſe he comes at his knowledge a ſhorter way.</p>
            <p>He indeed pretends to an immediate and direct in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration from God. And I take upon myſelf to prove, by the ordinary exertion of human ſagacity, that he is really inſpired. And I ſhall prove it in this manner.</p>
            <p>He tells us in a dry, conciſe, unqualified aſſertion, that ſuch a thing is ſo and ſo—as he has it from God; but he gives us no reaſon why it ſhould be ſo; and we ſee at once that he repeats his leſſon by hear-ſay. I will take <hi>his</hi> clue, and lead you on ſtep by ſtep through the different degrees of analyſis, till you come at the very
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028790_0013_0FDD45DEC7C05830"/>
concluſion with which he ſets out:—ſhewing you by ſcientifical proceſs, and almoſt ocular demonſtration, all the predicaments which he has totally omitted:—and ſo connect my arguments with his affirmations, that they ſhall mutually ſupport, corroborate, and confirm each other. The analyſis, on my part, ſhall give evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the authenticity of his inſpiration; and the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, on his part, ſhall <hi>è converſo</hi> bear witneſs to the fidelity of my expoſition.</p>
            <p>And now, to give ſome previous teſtimonial of my own pretenſions in this mode of inveſtigation, conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able indeed to the general line of Mr. Brothers's decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, but not explicitly mentioned in any part of them—I affirm from my own diſcoveries, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Daniel poſitively and particularly denounces anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation to the Britiſh navy in this war. And on proof of this propoſition, in the courſe of my Eſſay I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to reſt my whole pretenſions to penetration.</p>
            <p>If we conſult the map of Europe, it will be found to comprehend little more than the dominions of the following ſovereigns—</p>
            <p>The Emperor of Germany, and the Princes of the Empire.</p>
            <p>The Empreſs of Ruſſia.</p>
            <p>The Pope.</p>
            <p>The Kings of England, France, Spain, Pruſſia, and Sardinia.</p>
            <p>To every one of theſe has Mr. Brothers prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated a fatal cataſtrophe; and I aſſert that of myſelf, without any aſſiſtance from him, (for, when I called upon him expreſsly to beg explanation and ſatisfaction, he had no other anſwer for me, than that I muſt exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the ſcriptures) I have diſcovered the fate of every one of theſe to be unequivocally announced in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of Daniel and Eſdras. If I ſucceed in fully eſtabliſhing theſe points only, and I ſhall do more, there is an end of altercation: we very fairly may, <hi>nay,</hi> we ought, and by the moſt rigid rules of ſound criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028790_0014_0FDD45DF5F4F7508"/>
and logic we muſt, give him credit for all the reſt of his predictions—<hi>ex pede Herculem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for the diſcuſſion. It muſt neceſſarily be dry; and what it wants in entertainment muſt be made up, if poſſible, by conciſeneſs on my part, taking care at the ſame time to omit nothing of importance.</p>
            <p>Daniel, in one of his viſions, tells us that he ſaw four beaſts<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>And four great beaſts came from the ſea, different from one another.</p>
                  <p>The firſt was like a lion, and it had eagle's wings; I beheld till the wings were plucked, when it was lifted up on the earth, and made ſtand no the earth as a man: and a man's heart was given to it.</p>
               </note>; theſe were interpreted to him to be four kings. All the commentators on this chapter have ſought theſe kings in four ſucceſſive monarchies, and they have all laboured in vain to fix any one of them with accuracy and preciſion.</p>
            <p>Mr. Brothers gives us the clue to the whole myſtery in a ſingle word—he ſays, "they are four kings <hi>now.</hi>"</p>
            <p>For very obvious reaſons, I omit to ſpeak of the firſt beaſt, which we are told means the king of England; and ſhall uſe ſo much the leſs ceremony with the ſecond.</p>
            <p>"And behold another beaſt, a ſecond like to a bear: and it raiſed up itſelf on one ſide; and it had three ribs in the mouth of it, between the teeth of it: and they ſaid thus unto it: "Ariſe, devour much fleſh."</p>
            <p>Mr. Brothers with moſt laconic preciſion ſays <q>This verſe means the preſent Empreſs of Ruſſia.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now for the proof. It will hardly be contended me, that the bear is not a juſt, apt, and congenial ſymbol for the Ruſſian territory and empire; for, as we ſay the <hi>Roman eagle,</hi> the <hi>Britiſh lion,</hi> or the <hi>Chineſe dragon,</hi> ſo we ſay the <hi>"Ruſſian bear."</hi> In the famous little trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of John Bull's Law-ſuit, England is called <hi>John Bull,</hi> France <hi>Lewis Baboon,</hi> Holland <hi>Nic Frog,</hi> and Ruſſia <hi>Peter Bear.</hi> Nor is it poſſible that any other monarchy in Europe ſhould be typified by this animal. Beſides, as, in a complete well-written prophecy, every part muſt mutually bear upon and ſupport all the reſt,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028790_0015_0FDD45E0C72AABC8"/>
to make one compact whole, we muſt preſently ſee, by the remainder of the context, than this bear can be no other than the preſent Empreſs of Ruſſia. <q>It raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up itſelf on one ſide;</q> that is, it extended its do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, it exalted its power all on one ſide. And how could Ruſſia do otherwiſe? What is there worthy of her ambition to the weſt? and to the eaſt and north all is already her own! all her exertions muſt neceſſarily be, as we all know they have been, directed towards the ſouth, and aiming pointedly at Conſtantinople. <hi>"And it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it."</hi> This is the true <hi>crux criticorum.</hi> If I can ſurmount this obſtacle, all other impediments will dwindle to nothing. Firſt, then, let us conſider the poſition of theſe ribs: they are in the mouth, but not within the teeth, for they are between them; therefore they are exactly in the place, and performing the functions of files or whetſtones, to ſharpen the teeth: and indeed the words they utter, figuratively mark out their office, ſaying, "Ariſe, devour much fleſh." What then is it that we can properly denominote a file or whetſtone for the teeth? Appetite: appetite, and nothing elſe. And where is appetite or hunger properly ſituated? What is its local habitation?—The ſtomach:—and the ſtomach is encloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within the ribs. Now we muſt all agree, that the ſtomach could not be viſibly repreſented in a viſion as lying between the teeth; but that the ribs (the caſe of the ſtomach) having a form not very unlike that of the hone to file, may be put inſtead of the ſtomach, in the office of giving an edge to the teeth, to mark the voracity of appetite. But why then <hi>three</hi> ribs?—Here we come to the grand deciſive maſter-ſtroke of the character of the preſent Empreſs? becauſe her appetites are three, and they are all inſatiable to devour human fleſh: inſatiable luſt, inſatiable ambition, and inſatiable cruelty. Now for the preciſe <hi>time,</hi> I had almoſt ſaid the very day and hour, to which the Prophet alludes. <q>And they ſaid thus unto it: Ariſe, devour much fleſh.</q>—<hi>Ariſe?</hi> So then the teeth were dormant, quieſcent, immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able:
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028790_0016_0FDD45E514EAD3F0"/>
they required a ſtimulus, a whetting, a prey ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their taſte, to rouſe them, and ſet them to work. I now aſk the whole country, and more particularly his Majeſty's Miniſters, whether we have not been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for above theſe two years in endeavouring to whet, ſtir up, and animate the great Catherine, who is one of the high contracting parties, and a principal in this moſt deſtructive war, without being able to move her one inch: nor have we yet obtained from her a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle ſhip, or even a ſingle man, to aid in the overthrow of this enormous Republic of France. But when her own predominating paſſions get between her teeth, and ſharpen her appetite; <hi>then</hi> ſhe can <hi>ariſe</hi> faſt enough, and devour the fleſh of thirty or forty miſerable Poles in a fortnight, and almoſt in cold blood, juſt as ſhe had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſerved the ſame number of Turks at Iſmael.</p>
            <p>And now, if I have not triumphantly proved this bear to be the preſent Empreſs of Ruſſia, as Mr. Brothers ſays ſhe is, then there is neither meaning in language, nor concluſion in logic.</p>
            <p>Let us next try if we can equally well tame and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliariſe the third beaſt:</p>
            <p>
               <q>After this I beheld, and lo! another like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl. The beaſt had four heads, and dominion was given to it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Brothers informs us, this means Louis XVI. the late King of France.</p>
            <p>Now of all the beaſts of the earth, Why is the king or nation of France moſt like a leopard?</p>
            <p>Naturaliſts have obſerved the leopard to have all the malicious playfulneſs of the cat or monkey united with all the ferocity of the tyger; and Voltaire's deſcription of his own countrymen exactly tallies with this idea; for he ſays they are a compound of the monkey and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Nor is this all: for the delicate variegation of the leopard's ſpots, and the beautiful ſleekneſs of his fur, exactly mark out the Pariſian petit-maître. I might have added, that, as the leopard's ſpots are
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028790_0017_0FDD45E659E3C308"/>
ſprinkled in regular confuſion, and of nearly equal ſize, over his whole body, ſo were the royal robes of the kings of France ſprinkled all over with fleurs-de-lis of gold. But this leopard of Daniel's had four heads; and one of theſe, which St. John in the Revelations (though omitted by Daniel) ſays he ſaw cut off, and afterwards healed, Mr. Brothers tells us, means the death of Charles I. <hi>of England,</hi> and the reſtoration of monarchy in the perſon of his ſon Charles II. This very circumſtance, which ſeems at firſt to throw an inexplicable difficulty in the way of interpreting the whole beaſt as repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative of the king of France, is the very clue which muſt lead us to the juſt and infallible ſenſe of the aenig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma; and is of itſelf quite ſufficient to evince that the explication comes from a power more than human.</p>
            <p>Every body knows that our Charles I. was betrothed to the Infanta of Spain; but that on going incognito to Madrid to ſee her, he broke off the match, and returned home through Paris, where he fell in love with Henrietta of France; to his marriage with whom all his ſubſequent misfortunes and premature death are to be attributed. His two ſons Charles and James, who both reigned in England, were avowed or concealed penſioners of the court of France, and the latter died in that country, a refugee, and wretched dependant on the oſtentatious hoſpitality of Lewis XIV. It is impoſſible then to deny for a moment, that the Stuart family were a ſupernumery head on the body of the French monarchy; but dying before it. Louis XVI. is the ſecond head; and he pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, like the firſt, by decollation, ſome time ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to the loſs of his throne. The third head is the preſent king of Spain, a lineal deſcendant of Lewis XIV. of France, who placed the Spaniſh crown on his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's head: but a deciduous crown it is, and ſure to fall; for, as the main head and heart of the beaſt are gone with Louis XVI. it is certain that none of its members, much leſs any one of its heads, can long ſurvive the cataſtrophe. Conſanguineal and political alliances co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate to point out the king of Sardinia as the fourth
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028790_0018_0FDD45E7CE4F6038"/>
head, whoſe dominions we have guarantied to him. He has two daughters married to the two brothers of Lewis XVI. and Mr. Brothers is thus perfectly warranted by Daniel in ſaying, that <q>it is not all the navy of England nor the armies of Europe united, can prevent the king of Sardinia from being dethroned.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now we ſee to demonſtration how well the four heads of this leopard tally with the actual ſtate of Europe.— Had the prophet meant to deſcribe four ſucceſſive ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns of the ſame kingdom, or four ſeparate kingdoms united under the ſame ſovereign, the beaſt in prophetic language could not poſſibly have had more than one body, and one head. But as he alluded to four diſtinct and nearly independent monarchs, bound together by the cloſeſt ties of alliance and intereſt, he beautifully repreſented one body as the common centre of union to four diſtinct heads.</p>
            <p>I had almoſt forgotten that this French leopard had four wings of a fowl.—Well, theſe <hi>wings</hi> are nothing but <hi>ſails:</hi> they both belong to the ſame element. Who does not know that <hi>ſail</hi> and <hi>wing</hi> are, in all languages, convertible terms? And when Daedalus is ſaid to have made wings for himſelf and his ſon Icarus to fly from Crete, does any man doubt that they ſailed away in ſhips? The wings are the fleets of France, and their number is <hi>four,</hi> becauſe thoſe fleets pervade all the quarters of the globe. But why then the wings of a <hi>fowl?</hi> Here I muſt neceſſarily let out the diſcovery, to which I have already appealed as the teſt of my own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual ſkill in prophetic phraſe. Though <hi>fowls</hi> may traverſe the atmoſphere on their wings, from one end of the world to the other, the eagle alone is queen of the air; and to her all the feathered creation muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ſtrike ſail. Now Daniel has expreſsly ſaid that the eagle's wings were attached to the body of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh lion (the firſt beaſt); and he adds, alas! <q>
                  <hi>I beheld,</hi> until the wings thereof were plucked.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The final diſſolution of theſe three firſt beaſts is thus ſummarily ſet forth by the Prophet:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:028790_0019_0FDD45EBB740C680"/>
               <q>As concerning the reſt of the beaſts, they had their dominion taken away, yet their lives were prolonged for a ſeaſon and time.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That is, in plain Engliſh, they muſt all loſe their crowns, as Lewis XVI. did, (who was one of three,) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two years previous to the loſs of their lives. Now I do poſitively affirm, that in theſe inſtances, as far as they go, we muſt either reject the prophecies of Daniel as abſurd, aprocryphal, forged, and falſe, or admit that Mr. Brothers, who has ſo completely unlocked their myſterious alluſions, has received directly from God himſelf the key <hi>for that purpoſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Author has entered much more into detail reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fourth beaſt, than any of the former, for which reaſon I ſhall take ſo much the leſs notice of him. But it is impoſſible not to feel the full force of his applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the prophecy to the King of Pruſſia, in that little horn that grew up after the former, "in which <hi>were eyes as the eyes of a man,</hi>" viz. perpetually on the watch, and looking ſharp out after every proſpect of additional territory, or immediate profit, without regard to the means:—whether in France, or in England, or in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, or any other where elſe—neither an acre nor a dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar comes amiſs to him. "And I <hi>beheld!</hi>" ſays Daniel, "becauſe of the great words which the horn ſpake."— The prophet himſelf ſeems here to ſympathiſe with the aſtoniſhment of all Europe, at the monſtrous atrocities and intolerable blaſphemies of the Duke of Brunſwick's famous manifeſto, which I am ſorry I have not here by me, to inſert as a comment on the divine text. The ruin and death of this deteſtable horn I ſhall preſently ſhew from Eſdras: Daniel gives it us in the 26th verſe: <q>But the judgment ſhall ſit, and they ſhall take away his dominion, to conſume and to deſtroy it, unto the end:</q>—as well as in the lump with that of the beaſt.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I beheld even till the beaſt was ſlain, and his body deſtroyed, <hi>and given to the burning flame.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Brothers moſt truly interprets this paſſage, as relating to the death of the Emperor of Germany, (p. 33)
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:028790_0020_0FDD45ECFABAD9E0"/>
"It is," ſays he, "certain, and all the armies in Europe cannot ſave him. The judgment of God is alſo, that he ſhall ſuffer the puniſhment of everlaſting fire." He enters minutely into particulars in another part of his book, where he tells us, <q>the Imperial family will all be cut off, and no ſucceſſor will for ever after ariſe.</q> And again, <q>This is Francis II. the preſent Emperor of Germany. To be related to him now, will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered hereafter as a capital crime.</q>—To come at this moſt tremendous curſe, and alſo to find the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular deſignation of the death of the King of Pruſſia, and the utter downfall of the Popedom, we muſt have recourſe to the 2d Book of Eſdras.—Now this 2d Book of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dras has hitherto been eſteemed an apocryphal compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the loweſt order, and ſo it is termed in our church Bibles; where it is ſaid to have been written about the time of Domitian by ſome learned Hebrew, to be extant only in the Latin, and to be ſtuffed full of Jewiſh fables and Rabbinical rhapſodies. But I have always conſidered this ſame book of Eſdras as one of the moſt ſublime, the moſt comprehenſive, and the moſt explicit of all the ancient prophecies. And when we ſhall have heard his beautiful allegory of the whole Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man empire, from its firſt republican form to its actual ſtate at this moment, I am ſure we ſhall agree that, whether Eſdras lived in the time of Domitian, in that of Daniel, or in that of Adam, there never was a more truly wonderful and ſuper-human epitome of a long and eventful hiſtory revealed from the pen of man. It is in the xith chapter.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Then I ſaw a dream, and behold there came up from the ſea an eagle, which had twelve feathered wings, and three heads. And I ſaw, and behold ſhe ſpread her wings over all the earth, and all the winds of the air blew on her and were gathered together. And I beheld, and out of her feathers there grew other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary feathers, and they became little feathers, and ſmall. But her heads "were at reſt: the head in the midſt was greater than the other, yet reſted it
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:028790_0021_0FDD45EE9BCE7438"/>
with the reſidue. Moreover, I beheld, and lo! the eagle flew with her feathers, and reigned upon earth, and over them that dwelt therein. And I ſaw that all things under heaven were ſubject unto her, and no man ſpake againſt her, no, not one creature upon earth. And I beheld, and lo! the eagle roſe upon her talons, and ſpoke to her feathers, ſaying, Watch not all at once; ſleep every one in his own place, and watch by courſe. But let the heads be preſerved unto the laſt. And I beheld, and lo! the voice went not out of her heads, but from the midſt of her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here in theſe firſt ten verſes we have an Iliad, and more than an Iliad, in a nutſhell.—The <hi>eagle</hi> is the type of Rome. In this at leaſt I ſhall not be in danger of contradiction.</p>
            <p>But what is the meaning, in this and ſeveral other paſſages of the Prophet, of the word <hi>ſea?</hi>—It cannot be taken literally; for Rome is an inland city.—It muſt therefore be obſerved, as a general rule, that in allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical writings, every word is a portion of the allegory; and thus if the eagle be allegorical, the ſea from whence it ariſes is allegorical alſo. We have the direct expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of it in the Revelations, where mention is made of the great Whore that ſitteth upon many waters.— And in the 15th verſe of the ſame chapter, the angel ſays, <q>The waters which thou ſaweſt, where the Whore ſitteth, are <hi>peoples,</hi> and <hi>multitudes,</hi> and <hi>nations,</hi> and <hi>tongues.</hi>
               </q> This eagle, therefore, coming up from the ſea, is the city of Rome gradually riſing among the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Italy.</p>
            <p>The Prophet firſt is made to behold all the ſucceſſive viciſſitudes of her fate, wrought up into one compact aſſemblage. Her extent of dominion is marked by her wings over the whole earth. Her twelve feathered wings are the twelve Caeſars, and her three heads are, the Pope, the Emperor of Germany, and King of Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia. Well indeed might it be ſaid, that the heads <hi>reſted;</hi> for as yet they were nothing but embryos in the womb
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:028790_0022_0FDD45F2431DA738"/>
of futurity. "And I beheld," ſays the Prophet, "and lo! the voice went not out of her heads, but <hi>from the midſt of her body."</hi>—This is the true ſpirit of prophetic lore, this is the genuine ſpark of Promethean fire! How was it poſſible in ſuch few words, and yet with ſuch aſtoniſhing accuracy, to delineate the focus from whence emanate all the rays of republican authority?</p>
            <p>Ver. 12. <q>And I looked, and behold! on the right ſide there aroſe one feather, and reigned over all the earth: and ſo it was, that when it reigned, the end of it came, and the <hi>place</hi> thereof appeared no more.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The feather that now roſe up on the right ſide was Julius Caeſar; and the Prophet's expreſſion is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable—<q>And ſo it was, that when it reigned, the end of it came, and the <hi>place</hi> thereof appeared no more.</q>—We ſee clearly that this reign expired ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, almoſt at its very commencement, and was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by a certain period of interregnum.</p>
            <p>
               <q>So the next following ſtood up, and reigned, and had a great time; and it happened, that when it reigned the end of <hi>it</hi> came alſo, like as the firſt, ſo that it appeared no more. Then there came a voice unto it, and ſaid: Hear thou, that haſt borne rule over the earth ſo long: this I ſay unto thee, before thou beginneſt to appear no more, There ſhall none af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thee attain unto thy time, neither unto the half thereof.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The next feather after this interval is Auguſtus. To put the matter out of all doubt, the inſpired writer takes particular care to inform us of the great length of his reign: a circumſtance remarkable enough of it it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but rendered much more ſo, by his being ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutely accurate as to ſtate with preciſion, that the reign of no other prince who ſhould ever after govern that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſhould attain even to half the duration of that of Auguſtus. And therefore it is impoſſible this verſe ſhould be interpreted of any other emperor but him.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not here follow the Prophet through the next ten verſes from the 17th to the 27th—(They deſcribe
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:028790_0023_0FDD1C898C686058"/>
the reſt of the Caeſars, and the ſubſequent commotions in the ſtate)—but ſhall go on to the 28th verſe.</p>
            <p>
               <q>And I beheld, and lo! the two that remained thought alſo in themſelves to reign: and when they ſo thought, behold! there awaked one of the heads that were at reſt, namely, it that was in the midſt for that was, greater than the two other heads, and then I ſaw that the two other heads were joined with it. And behold! the head was turned with them that were with it, and did <hi>eat up</hi> the two feathers under the wing that would have reigned. But this head put the whole earth in fear, and bear rule in it over all thoſe that dwelt upon the earth, with much oppreſſion; and it had the governance of the world <hi>more than all the wings</hi> that had been.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now we come to the Papacy, to that great head in the midſt, to which were joined the two other heads; namely, the States which were thereafter to form the dominions of the Empire and the King of Pruſſia. The gradual encroachments of that ſpiritual predominance over all the temporal authorities of the time are admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deſcribed by the head <hi>eating up</hi> the two feathers that would have reigned. And <hi>this head put the whole earth in fear.</hi> How? By launching its moſt blaſphemous thunders in interdictions, excommunications, and every ſpecies of eccleſiaſtical artillery, <hi>with much,</hi> very much <hi>oppreſſion,</hi> as ſays the Prophet. Now for the cloſe of the prophetical drama:</p>
            <p>
               <q>And after this, I beheld, and lo! the head that was in the midſt ſuddenly appeared no more, like as the wings; but there remained the two heads, which alſo in like ſort ruled upon the earth, and over thoſe that dwelt therein.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The reformation, and revolt of ſo many nations from the Pope's power, both temporal and ſpiritual, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in theſe verſes; and his downfall is expreſsly mentioned to precede that of the other two heads, namely, the Emperor and the King of Pruſſia, who
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:028790_0024_0FDD45F3C2429918"/>
continue to reign now, <hi>in like ſort as the wings</hi> (or twelve feathers) formerly did.</p>
            <p>
               <q>And I beheld, and lo! the head upon the right ſide devoured it that was on the left ſide.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Words cannot more expreſsly pronounce that the King of Pruſſia is deſtined to fall principally by the means of the Emperor of Germany. I ſay <hi>principally,</hi> becauſe Mr. Brothers mentions that the Empreſs of Ruſſia will aſſiſt in his deſtruction. But, from this verſe, I have not a particle of doubt, but that ſhe will in this caſe act only as an auxiliary in the Emperor's quarrel, even though ſhe may contribute more than an equal ſhare to his victory.</p>
            <p>After this comes the great cataclyſm, the moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful tremendous judgment upon the Emperor:</p>
            <p>Verſe 36.—<q>Then I heard a voice which ſaid unto me, Look before thee, and conſider the thing that thou ſeeſt. And I beheld, and lo! as it were, a roaring lion chaſed out of the wood; and I ſaw that he ſent out a man's voice unto the eagle, and ſaid, Hear thou; I will talk with thee; and the Higheſt ſhall ſay unto thee, Art not thou it that remaineſt of the four beaſts whom I made to reign in my world?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Before we go any farther, it may be neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that the Prophet, without any one circumſtance alluding to the connection between him and Daniel, comes here all at once into the hiſtory of the four beaſts, and expreſsly declares that his eagle is the very ſame with that fourth beaſt which Daniel ſaw, but did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineate; only we are certain that it could not much have reſembled an eagle, from the partial account he has given of him. If, however, Daniel's fourth beaſt be the Emperor of Germany, this muſt alſo be the ſame Emperor. And <hi>vice verſâ;</hi> if <hi>this</hi> be the Emperor, as the whole preceding narrative does not leave the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt poſſibility of a doubt, Daniel's beaſt muſt be the Emperor alſo. I ſhall omit the preliminary articles of accuſation againſt his conduct, and come at once to the judgment pronounced upon him, and all the members of his family, by God, in the 45th verſe:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:028790_0025_0FDD45F53A6A29A0"/>
               <q>And therefore appear no more, thou eagle, nor thy horrible wings, nor thy wicked feathers, nor thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious heads, nor thy hurtful claws, nor all thy vain body.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Every member, limb, joint, and articulation of the whole eagle, is here put in requiſition, and ſeparately enumerated, to take in every ſcion and branch of that devoted generation. Mr. Brothers might therefore well ſay, <q>That to be related to the Emperor now, would hereafter be deemed a capital crime.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame cataſtrophe of the Papacy, the King of Pruſſia, and the Emperor, is alſo clearly pointed out in the next chapter of Eſdras, which contains an interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, after the prophetic mode, of the viſion which I have juſt gone through. I ſhall only here make uſe of the 26th, 27th, and 28th verſes of that xiith chapter, which run thus:</p>
            <p>
               <q>And whereas thou ſaweſt that the great head ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared no more, it ſignifies that one of them ſhall die upon his bed, and yet with pain.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is incontrovertibly the Papacy, as I have before explained it. We have long ſeen it waſting with a grievous ſickneſs, and it is now on its death-bed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring in great agony. Mr. Brothers tells us in his book, that the Emperor will ſoon give it the <hi>coup de grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>For the two that remain ſhall be ſlain with the ſword.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Emperor's authority, and that of the King of Pruſſia, are now in apparent health: their downfall, therefore, being deſtined to be ſudden, will have no appearance of a natural decay, but may be likened to a violent death by a ſword.</p>
            <p>
               <q>For the ſword of the one ſhall devour the other; but at laſt ſhall he fall through the ſword himſelf.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When theſe two great potentates ſhall quarrel, we cannot poſſibly doubt but that the Emperor will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently demoliſh his Pruſſian Majeſty; and therefore we are at no loſs to aſcertain their different perſons in this place. And now, having ſeen all theſe heroes fairly brought to the grave, I ſhall here take my leave of
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:028790_0026_0FDD45F9D588B200"/>
them, and proceed to a new ſubject; for which purpoſe we muſt open the Revelations.</p>
            <p>Mr. Brothers tells us, that the Babylon mentioned in the xviiith chapter Apocalypſe, does not mean Rome, but London—contrary to the expreſs ſentiment of all former expoſitors; and he proves his poſition in a very ſatisfactory manner, by ſhewing, that the various and multiplied alluſions to navigation and commerce, in the deſcription of this Babylon, cannot poſſibly be ſtrained, with any propriety, to indicate an inland city, totally incapable of ſhipping, and remarkably deſtitute of trade. His remarks are perfectly juſt and appoſite; all I have therefore to do, is, to corroborate and confirm his proofs, by others drawn from the nature of the articles of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize ſaid to have been dealt in there. Verſes 11, 12, 13.</p>
            <p>
               <q>And the merchants of the earth ſhall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth her merchandize any more: the merchandize of gold, and of ſilver, and precious ſtones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and ſilk, and ſcarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner of veſſels of ivory, and all manner of veſſels of precious wood, and of braſs, and iron, and marble, and cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincenſe, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beaſts, and ſheep, and horſes, and chariots, and ſlaves, and ſouls of men.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here we have an inſtance of the prophetic art I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mentioned, by which the prominent features of the repreſentation or viſion are ſuch as are put on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to miſlead the obſerver; and the key to the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lies quite in the ſhade and obſcurity of the back ground. For all this long and tedious enumeration of wares and commodities is really nothing at all to the buſineſs of the prophecy, whoſe real explication lies wholly in the laſt five words, <hi>"ſlaves and ſouls of men."</hi> What nation is notorious for its extenſive and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble traffic in ſlaves? Surely no part of Italy. I would aſk an honorable gentleman, whoſe unparalleled exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and perſeverance in the cauſe of his oppreſſed fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creatures do him ſo much honor in the ſight of God and man, whether <hi>he</hi> cannot in an inſtant put his finger
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:028790_0027_0FDD45FB3AA9F990"/>
on the city rendered particularly infamous <hi>by dealing in human fleſh!</hi> We all know it is the <hi>Aſſiento</hi> wholeſale trader; it is the <hi>City of London.</hi>—But ſouls of men are alſo ſold there—<hi>Souls of men?</hi> And where can ſouls of men be properly deemed an article of trade? Certainly not in Rome, where ignorance and prieſtcraft bind up the ſouls of all their deluded ſubjects in chains of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting adamant. Still leſs in the <hi>ci-devant</hi> Paris, or Vienna, or Madrid, or any other city under a deſpotic government, where tyranny, whoſe eſſence it is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh and utterly annihilate the human mind itſelf, leaves not a ſingle man who can truly and properly <hi>call his ſoul his own.</hi> It is here, in England, it is in this and of liberty, where every man <hi>has a ſoul</hi> which he can keep or ſell as he pleaſes, that this article can alone be called a merchandize; and Parliament is the grand em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porium for the commodity.</p>
            <p>Muſt I ſpeak out? Muſt I produce an inſtance? Well, then, I <hi>have</hi> an inſtance: I myſelf am that inſtance, and the Speaker is a living witneſs to the truth of my aſſertion. There as he ſat in his chair, day after day, for three years together, beholding me crouched behind the Treaſury Bench, with my ſoul in my hand, like a country girl in the market with her butter and eggs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her, anxiouſly waiting for the lucky moment when the Tellers would come and rid me of my burthen, that I might run home and hide myſelf. And while I <hi>did</hi> ſell my ſoul, it was all in the true ſpirit of commercial credit <hi>that ſo peculiarly diſtinguiſhes this country:</hi> I ſold it purely upon truſt: I never have received one ſhilling; and now I am taught by experience to apprehend that the purchaſer will never pay me one farthing for it. But though I ſold my ſoul, I could never ſell my tongue. While the one loitered an abandoned proſtitute in the market, the other remained ſullenly immovable at home. The emancipation of the former would have opened the priſon doors of the latter—could I have caught the Speaker's eye. But it is of no conſequence now—<hi>Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravi animam meam</hi>—and both my ſoul and tongue are from henceforrh at liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>London,</hi> as Mr. Brothers ſays, is known alſo in the Revelations by the name of <hi>Sodom:</hi> for which he quotes this paſſage of the xith chapter:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:028790_0028_0FDD45FCDD5CBD28"/>
               <q>And their dead bodies" (viz. thoſe of the two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes) "ſhall lie in the great city, which ſpiritually is called Sodom in Egypt, <hi>where alſo our Lord was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And in what city can our Lord be ſaid to have been crucified except at Jeruſalem, which ſurely was not in Egypt?—Why there, <hi>and there only,</hi> where the bleſſed ſacrament of redemption is proſtituted to the purpoſes of venality and ambition: where the benefits of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are bartered for filthy lucre: where the holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of Chriſt's death is degraded to a teſt and qualification for holding civil employments: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, where the two witneſſes of the Goſpel are trampled under foot by authority of the State?—In no nation under heaven but in England, in no church in the world but that by law eſtabliſhed here, does ſuch a profanation exiſt: in that very church too which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly ſays in one part of her own ritual, that <hi>taking the ſacrament unworthily is crucifying Chriſt's body afreſh, and eating and drinking our own damnation.</hi> 
               <q>Out of thine own mouth will I condemn thee</q>—thou wicked church!—Here then we have in St. John both Babylon and Sodom to ſignify one and the ſame city, juſt as we have the two cities of London and Weſtminſter within the ſame boundary; but which of the two be Sodom, and which Babylon, I leave to be decided by that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacious aſſembly which has no doubt moſt oracularly pronounced whether Richard Brothers be an impoſtor or a madman.</p>
            <p>And here let me aſk, whether I have not, in the moſt clear and ſatisfactory manner, and upon full proof, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed every one of thoſe poſitions which I at firſt pledged myſelf to maintain: as well in ſupport of Mr. Brothers's well-founded pretenſions to divine inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as of my own qualifications and abilities for exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the taſk I had undertaken? And I hope thoſe perſons of the better conditions of life, whom I know to have ſaid that this book was calculated to make an impreſſion on none but the moſt illiterate vulgar, will be now inclined to admit that it <hi>may</hi> have weight even with a man not much leſs inſtructed or experienced than themſelves, nor very greatly their inferior in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:028790_0029_0FDD460163420040"/>
literature, or ſituation. Moſt of all, I hope that every one will at leaſt think it worth while to examine the Scriptures calmly and attentively, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them with Mr. Brothers's aſſertions, and then judge for himſelf; for I can aſſure my readers, that I could never obtain the ſmalleſt explanation of any part of his book from Mr. Brothers, whom I called upon expreſsly for that purpoſe. He drily referred me to my Bible, obſerving that he could neither ſubtract from, nor add a ſingle word to, what God had expreſsly dictated to him. The field is ſtill open for freſh labourers; I have occupied but a ſmall part of it; as well becauſe it is fit this work ſhould be compriſed within moderate limits, as becauſe I am ſatisfied that I have heaped proof upon proof beyond all reaſonable neceſſity for full conviction. And here I ſhall cloſe the ſubject as far as relates to politics, and employ a few words with regard to Mr. Brothers himſelf.</p>
            <p>He ſays he is come to recall the Jews to their native country; and for the proof of his divine miſſion he refers us to the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous diſcoveries contained in his books, from a perſuaſion that, if we admit the prophecy, we cannot reject the prophet. Now that all Scripture as well as all Tradition bears teſtimony to the certainty of the recall of the Jews in the latter ages of the world, no man who has but a ſmattering of acquaintance with either can for a moment pretend to deny. The main deſign of Mr. Brothers, as far as he is perſonally concerned, is to ſhew us that the life and conduct of the firſt Moſes was a ſort of type or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined pattern for that of the ſecond; and for this purpoſe he quotes a text of Scripture, which can neither be eluded nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained away, that the man deſtined to lead the Jews a ſecond time to Paleſtine ſhould be <hi>like to Moſes himſelf.</hi> The Parallel between the two perſonages Mr. Brothers ſtates to have tallied hitherto, and he aſſerts that it will continue to do ſo; for, as Moſes aſcended from the ark of bull-ruſhes, ſo did Mr. Brothers riſe from a ſhip, having been bred to the navy. This coincidence of charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters might be evident at firſt ſight, Mr. Brothers aſſerts, that by the command of God himſelf, he cut a wand in 1792, which is to perform preciſely the ſame miracle with the former wand of Moſes. Nor need we now be aſtoniſhed or ſcandalized, when we hear Mr. Brothers affirm that God ſpeaks to him in plain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect words, as one man would ſpeak to another, ſince we kwow that in this reſpect Moſes was favoured with a communication ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly ſimilar. Moſes, born in Egypt, led the Iſraelites from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt through the Red Sea into Paleſtine. The birth-place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the ſecond Moſes, and the country from whence he is to
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:028790_0030_0FDD4602C6C99450"/>
ſummon the modern Hebrews, muſt ſpiritually at leaſt have at one time or other been alſo denominated Egypt, to make the parallel between two events move an all fours: and I have already proved, from St. John in the Revelations, that the great city (viz. <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>) was ſpiritually called Sodom <hi>in Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſpirit of this parallel Mr. Brothers remarks in his ſecond book—<q>Pharaoh is appointed to die, and his government to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the prieſts and all the abominable idolatries of Egypt ſhall periſh, never to be found any more.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall now ſlightly mention a few expreſſions to be found in Mr. Brothers's books, which have operated as ſtumbling-blocks to weak minds. And firſt, for the phraſe which has cauſed ſo much offence, where he calls himſelf <hi>God Almighty's Nephew.</hi> I ſincerely hope there is no man in this country who will openly deny that Jeſus Chriſt is God Almighty. If there be, I ſpeak not to him: I am ſure no member of the eſtabliſhed Trinitarian church can ſafely ſay otherwiſe. Now if Jeſus Chriſt had brothers and ſiſters, as is expreſsly proved from the Goſpel, the ſon of any one of thoſe muſt neceſſarily have been <hi>his</hi> nephew. Extend the line of filiation as far as we pleaſe, through 50, 100, or 1000 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcents, the laſt is ſtill a nephew, lineally deſcended from the firſt, in the ſame manner as every Jew to this day is a ſon of Abraham, and as we are all of us beyond all doubt ſons of Adam.</p>
            <p>Next, Mr. Brothers ſays, he was in a viſion taken up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, where he ſaw the Holy Ghoſt under the figure of a ſilver-coloured dove. As a ſpirit truly the Holy Ghoſt may have no ſhape; but that he actually appeared <hi>as a dove</hi> when Jeſus Chriſt was baptized by John in Jordan, I preſume no believer in the Goſpel will think fit to conteſt with me. Again, Mr. Brothers ſaw Satan entering London <hi>in a human ſhape.</hi> Why what ſhape ſhould he be in? Perhaps, indeed, if he had repreſented him with ſaucer eyes, cloven hoofs, and a tail a fathom and a half long, all the old women of both ſexes in this great city would have been mightily tempted to believe him. But after all, what other ſhape can we more conſiſtently ſuppoſe him to have worn in his triumphal entry into a city inhabited by men? I am only ſorry, that, deſcribed as he is in robes of white and ſcarlet, he muſt have been hardly diſtinguiſhable at firſt ſight from any of the Peers of Great Britain, whom I have ſeen in the ſame dreſs come into and go out of Weſtminſter Hall at the diabolical Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment.</p>
            <p>Objections, but thoſe perfectly groundleſs, and founded in groſs ignorance of the general courſe of God's judgments, have been ſtarted againſt Mr. Brothers's aſſertion in his firſt book, <q>that God would have deſtroyed the city of London in 1791— but for his interceſſions.</q>
            </p>

Sodom, and God's anſwers in the xviiith chapter of Geneſis: as well as ſeveral other ſimiliar circumſtances in Scripture. But there is a paſſage in Ezekiel which comes, if poſſible, ſtill more exactly to the point; it is in the xxiid chapter, the title of which runs thus—<q>V. 1. A catalogue of ſins in Jeruſalem.—17. God will burn them as droſs in his furnace.—23. The gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al corruption of prophets, prieſts, princes and people.</q>—</p>
            <p>Now let us attend to the 30th and 31ſt verſes. It is God that ſpeaks.</p>
            <p>
               <q>And I ſought for a man among them, that ſhould make up the hedge, and ſtand in the gap before me for the land, that I ſhould not deſtroy it; but I found none. Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Words cannot be found more inconteſtably applicable to Mr. Brothers's deſcription of himſelf <q>ſtanding in the gap before the Lord for the city, that he ſhould not deſtroy it.</q> To controvert this principal, is not to want conviction, but to repel it.</p>
            <p>Now to conclude: If any man, calmly attending to what I have adduced, can ſtill conſider Mr. Brothers as an impoſtor or a madman, I wiſh him little joy of his feelings or his proſpects. But whatever judgment be pronounced on him, let it at leaſt be after a fair trial and ſufficient hearing. Let us firſt reflect, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be poſſible that a madam ſhould ſo ably and conſiſtently preſs into his ſervice the whole body of prophecy both in the Old and New Teſtament, all tending to one and the ſame diſtinct end; or whether an impoſtor ſhould ſo honeſtly and diſintereſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entreat us only to take ſerious care of ourſelves and our own moſt important concerns, leaving himſelf and all poſſible perſonal advantage totally out of the queſtion. And what then is the point he ſo arduouſly labours? Nothing more than that we would, before it be utterly too late, relinquiſh this <hi>juſt and neceſſary war;</hi> juſt, only becauſe it juſtifies God's vengeance—and neceſſary on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe neceſſary for our puniſhment. And I doubt not but it is his opinion, as it is moſt aſſuredly mine, and my advice alſo, that the <hi>Faſt</hi> which is appointed for the 25th of Feb. to implore ſucceſs on our arms, ſhould be converted, by Addreſs to his Majeſty, from both Houſes of Parliament to that effect, to the purpoſe of a ſolemn and ſincere humiliation for our crimes, and a moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ſupplication to God for the reſtoration of peace; and that we may take warning by the fate of our abandoned and ſubjuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ally, not to poſtpone our offers for a negotiation to the very laſt moment, when the ſword ſhall already be at our throats, and all hopes of obtaining moderate terms muſt be totally relinquſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Let us, while it is yet poſſible, adopt that moſt divine ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Goſpel, <hi>"on earth peace, good will towards men."</hi>
