            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My dear brethren and friends,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AT length, after a long and unexpected delay, I offer to your peruſal a few ſermons which I promiſed the public ſome years ago; all which ſome or other of you heard, and in which you are all concerned.</p>
            <p>It is not material to tell you, on what account I have laid by ſome, which I had tranſcribed for your ſervice, and which you probably expected to have ſeen with theſe. I have ſubſtituted in their room ſuch, as I thought might, by the divine bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, be moſt uſeful to you.</p>

great difficulty, that I forbear inlarging, more than the proper limits of ſuch an addreſs would admit.</p>
            <p>As for you: my Leiceſterſhire friends, amongſt whom my miniſtry was opened, and the firſt years of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> were delightfully ſpent, I cannot forget, and I hope you have not forgotten, that intimate and pleaſing friendſhip, with which we were once almoſt daily converſing; the ſweet counſel we have often taken together in private, as well as the pleaſure with which we have gone to the houſe of God in company. All theſe ſermons, but the ſecond and fifth of them, were firſt drawn up for your ſervice, and preached to you; and much of that tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for you, which gave birth to them, has been ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing freſh in my mind, while I have been taking this review of them. I hope they were not then like wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unprofitably ſpilt on the ground, and that the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſal of them may revive impreſſions made by the firſt hearing. Intermediate years have introduced new ſcenes; and ſome of us who were then in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of life, are now riſen up to the meridian of it. Providence has conducted many of you into new relations; and it is my pleaſure to obſerve, in how honourable and how uſeful a manner ſeveral of you are filling them up with their proper duties.</p>
            <p>While you are yourſelves inſtances of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py conſequences, which attend a religio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

God has put an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly period to the lives of ſome, who, when I was amongſt you, were the growing hopes of the reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive congregations to which they belonged. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of them have died while theſe ſermons were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

divine grace render ſome things, peculiarly intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the uſe of thoſe who are now beyond the reach of ſuch an addreſs, ſerviceable to others, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whoſe hands they may fall!</p>
            <p>Though I am providentially ſeparated from you, may I ſtill hear that you walk worthy of the Lord; and may every advancing year, and revolving day of life, ripen us more for that happineſs, which we hope 'ere long to ſhare with each other, in the houſe of our heavenly father!</p>
            <p>If any of you, who were once my care and my hope, have now forſaken the ways and the God of your fathers, and turned aſide to the paths of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs and folly, I now repeat the admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which I have formerly given you, that theſe things will, to you, above all others, be bitterneſs in the end. And I intreat you, that if you have any little regard ſtill remaining, for one to whom ſome of you have profeſſed not a little, you would at leaſt attentively peruſe the ſixth of theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, as containing reflections, which muſt ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or later, pierce your hearts, with penitential re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, or overlaſting deſpair. Oh, that divine grace might concur with it to prevent your ruin, and might give me to ſee you as wife, as religious, and as happy, as thoſe excellent parents once wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, whoſe eyes are now cloſed in the duſt; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> precepts and examples, charges and tears, yea ſeem long ſince to have forgot!</p>
            <p>As for you, my dear friends here at home, I have the pleaſure of converſing ſo often with you, that it is the leſs neceſſary now to addreſs you at large. Yet it is but juſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ice to you thus publickly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that, amidſt all that goodneſs and mercy, which has followed me all my days, there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which I more gratefully own, than that which brought me hither<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor does any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute more to make my miniſtry here comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:046736_0005_1021EF4427878990"/>
than the Spirit of ſeriouſneſs, which diſcovers itſelf in many young perſons amongſt us. Oh, that it were as univerſal, as in ſome it is amiable and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary! Permit me to remind you, that, as your remarkable importunity was the conſideration, which turned the ſcales for my coming hither, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had long hovered in uncertainty, ſo you are under ſome peculiar obligations to ſtudy the eaſe and comfort of my life, which you can never ſo effectually ſecure, as by the holy regularity of your own. Our aged friends are dropping away apace; nay, the graves have ſwallowed up many, very many of your own age, who, but a few months ago, promiſed long and extenſive uſefulneſs here. It is you that are to comfort me under theſe ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows. I can ſolemnly ſay, that I had much rather be numbered amongſt them, than live to ſee the glory of practical religion loſt in this ſociety, while it is under my care. Remember, that, under God, you are its ſupport; and remember, that the high hopes you have given me, would make a diſappointment ſit ſo much the heavier upon my heart.</p>
            <p>But I will not conclude with any thing ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable, as the mention of a diſappointment from you; but rather with recommending you, and thoſe to whom I have formerly ſtood in the like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, to the care of Chriſt, the great ſhepherd of the ſheep, and to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

And the text aſſures us, that his triumphs ſhall be as laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as extenſive: a future Seed ſhall ſerve him; they ſhall be accounted to the Lord for a generation; i. e. being brought to the knowledge and the profeſſion of the true religion, they ſhall be owned by God as his people: and it ſhall be their pious care, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare this glorious diſplay of his righteouſneſs<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Compare Rom iii. 25, 26.</note> to a people who ſhall be born of them, that he has done this; that it is the hand of God which has wrought out this great ſalvation. And though there are not many generations mentioned here, yet other ſcriptures aſſure us, that the kingdom of the Meſſiah is to be of a perpetual duration, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that ſuch promiſes as theſe are to be taken in their utmoſt extent.

               <p>UPON the whole then, it appears, that the words of the text are a prophecy, that the kingdom of Chriſt ſhall be perpetual, and extend itſelf to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt generations, as well as the remoteſt climates: and, through the divine goodneſs, we muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that this day is this ſcripture in part fulfilled among us. We dwell in a country, which, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Judea, lay at the ends of the earth, and which was long over-run with barbarity and idolatry yet we are now inſtructed in the knowledge of the God of Iſrael, and are this day aſſembled for his worſhip; ſo that at the diſtance of more than two thouſand years from the publication of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, we are the living witneſſes of its truth; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>I AM now particularly concerned, that you, my younger brethren, may be impreſſed with what I ſay: I ſhall therefore addreſs myſelf directly to you, and endeavour to ſhew how important and deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it is, that YOU be early tinctured with a ſenſe of religion, and heartily engaged in the ſervice of God.</p>
               <p>MAY the ſpirit of God, in the mean time, ſo ſpeak to your hearts, as that life and energy may be add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to thoſe convictions which, I am confident, your reaſon will not be able to oppoſe!</p>
               <p>Now I would intreat you, on this occaſion, ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to conſider the importance of your character and behaviour, with regard both to yourſelves and others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="unknown:046736_0014_1021EF5564E60F68"/>
I. NOTHING can be of greater importance, with regard to yourſelves, than your being early en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the ſervice of God.</p>
               <p>IT is a conſideration, which equally concerns you, and others of a more advanced age, that religion is, generally ſpeaking, the ſureſt way we can take to be happy in this world, and, through the merits and righteouſneſs of a Redeemer, the only way to glory in another; ſo that, as the apoſtle expreſſes it, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is profitable unto all things, having promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come<note n="(a)" place="bottom">1 Tim. iv. 8.</note>
               </p>
               <p>ITS tendency to promote our preſent comfort and happineſs, will abundantly appear from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence which it has on our external circumſtances, and on the temper of our minds. As to the former of theſe, I might enlarge on its beneficial effects, with regard to health and reputation, eſtate and friendſhip: and as to the latter, nothing is more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious than that it tends to ſecure the tranquillity and the pleaſure of the ſoul, as it either ſuppreſſes or moderates, thoſe turbulent paſſions which throw it into anguiſh and confuſion, while it gives abundant exerciſe to thoſe which are moſt ſweet and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Such is the immediate bleſſedneſs of the man who feareth the Lord, and delighteth greatly in his commandments<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Pſal. cxii. 1</note>. And whoſoever reflects on the evidence with which each of theſe particulars is attended, muſt acknowledge, that the ways of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom are ways of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths are peace<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Prov. iii. 17.</note>.</p>
               <p>To complete the argument, it is to be conſidered, that theſe pleaſant and peaceful paths lead up to the paradiſe of God: for invariable truth and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs has engaged, that to them who by patient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:046736_0015_1021EF5735144990"/>
in well doing, ſeek for glory, honour and immortality, he will render eternal life<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Rom. ii. 7.</note>.</p>
               <p>ON the other hand, if you go on in the neglect of God and religion, it is very poſſible you may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for this world, as thouſands have been, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery and folly: or, under ſome reſtraints of common prudence, which may ſecure you from that, if you do not violently over bear the voice of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, it will often diſquiet and torment you by its remonſtrances and expoſtulations; till in a little time death will remove you to the ſeats of horror, where the worm never dies, and the fire is never quenched<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Mark ix. 44.</note>. For God has ſolemnly declared, that he will render indignation and wrath, tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and anguiſh, to every ſoul of man that doeth evil<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Rom. ii. 8, 9.</note>; when the Lord Jeſus is revealed from heaven in flaming fire, taking vengeance on thoſe that know not God, and obey not the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel<note n="(d)" place="bottom">2 Theſ. i. 7, 8.</note>.</p>
               <p>ARE not the youngeſt of you concerned in ſuch declarations as theſe? And if you are, let con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſay, whether you are to be deſpiſed? It evidently appears, the queſtion is this: ſhall you ſpend your days upon earth like rational creatures, in the nobleſt enjoyment of God, and of yourſelves, till you riſe to the glories and pleaſures of the heavenly world? Or ſhall you live like idiots and like brutes, in the amuſements of a vain imagination, and the indulgence of the meaneſt appetites, till you ſink for ever under all the ſhame and remorſe of a polluted guilty mind, and the almighty vengeance of an incenſed God? And can you be ſo ſtupid as to imagine this queſtion will bear a debate, or that any of the little intereſts of time and ſenſe are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, while theſe things are forgotten? Surely I
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:046736_0016_1021EF5A8F919880"/>
may ſay, with the utmoſt propriety, as Moſes to the children of Iſrael<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Deut. xxx. 19.</note>, I have this day been ſetting before you life and death, a bleſſing and a curſe, chuſe which ſhall be your portion; but make the choice as thoſe that remember, it is not a vain thing for you, becauſe it is your life<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Deut. xxxii. 47.</note>.</p>
               <p>"IT is true," may you perhaps reply in your own minds, <q>theſe are ſolid arguments to prove, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is to be attended to, ſooner or later; but, it will not appear from them, that it is peculiarly the concern of the riſing generation</q> I anſwer in one word, (as you have often heard more at large) if it is to be regarded at all, it ſhould be regarded immediately; becauſe all the futurity you preſume upon is utterly precarious. The uncertainty of human life, and our entire dependance on that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred ſpirit, who is perfectly free in all his opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, concur to demonſtrate, beyond all poſſibility of contradiction, the madneſs of delay; and the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in of thouſands bears teſtimony to it. I might add, that there are many peculiar advantages of early piety, which render it vaſtly preferable to a late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, even ſuppoſing it were as certain, as it is dubious: but I ſhall not enter into the enumeration of them now, ſince I intend them for the ſubject of a diſtinct diſcourſe<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr Jennings's excellent ſermon on this ſubject, amongſt his other diſcourſes to young people, has prevented the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of the ſermon here referred to.

II. THAT it is of great importance to the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of others, that you of the riſing generation be early tinctured with a ſenſe of religion, or, in the language of the text, be a ſeed who ſhall ſerve the Lord.</p>
               <p>AND here I would ſhew at large,—that the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all who converſe with you may be conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly influenced by your character and behaviour;—that the comfort of your pious parents and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters is peculiarly concerned in it;—and that the propagation of religion to them who are yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, does, under God, moſt evidently depend upon you.</p>
               <p>1. THE happineſs of all who converſe with you will be conſiderably influenced by your charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and behaviour.</p>
               <p>THEY who have any ſenſe of religion themſelves will be tenderly concerned for your happineſs. They will rejoice to ſee you going on in thoſe ways which muſt ſurely lead to it; and they will be heartily grieved to ſee you chuſing your own miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, and rejecting the counſel of God againſt your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Luke vii. 30.</note>. And others of a humane and gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous temper, though deſtitute of the principles of true piety, will be ſolicitous for the honour, the comfort, and the uſefulneſs of your lives.</p>
               <p>BUT beſides this pleaſure or uneaſineſs, which will redound to ſuch perſons, in conſequence of theſe friendly and benevolent ſentiments, you ought to conſider, that all who converſe with you may find their happineſs increaſed or diminiſhed, by your regard to religion, or your neglect of it, as your behaviour to them will be influenced by it.</p>

IF you be early delivered into the mould of the goſpel, you will quickly learn you were not born for yourſelves. The mercies of God, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of a Redeemer, will teach you to exert your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the utmoſt for the ſervice of mankind, and to do good to all as you have opportunity<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Gal. vi. 10.</note> And in how many inſtances may your pious and charitable cares be effectual for the benefit of your fellow-creatures! In the ſeries of life, how many in the depths of poverty may be relieved by your liberality! How many in perplexed and intricate circumſtances may be guided aright by your pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent counſel! How many weeping eyes may be dried, and how many mourning hearts revived, by your tender ſympathy and friendly condolence! And if there be already in your natural temper a tendency towards ſuch expreſſions of humanity, how happily may it be directed and enlivened, when di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and evangelical motives are brought in to its aſſiſtance!</p>
               <p>BUT farther, your chriſtian charity will teach you to be, above all things, ſolicituous for the ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual and eternal happineſs of thoſe about you. And who can ſay, how much you may promote it! How many more aged chriſtians may be excited to ſhake off their indolence, and quicken their pace when they obſerve your ardency and zeal! And how happily might your piety tend to awaken, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim thoſe, who are going on in the paths of the deſtroyer: how amiable would the graces of chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity appear, as exemplified in you, amidſt all the inſnaring allurements of childhood and youth! And how affecting might it be to other young people, to hear religion recommended to them, not only by their parents and miniſters, but by their brethren and companions!</p>

THUS uſeful might you be in your earlieſt years, and as you were advancing in age and experience, your uſefulneſs might be daily increaſing; and if God ſhould ſpare you to the decline of life, you might bring forth much nobler fruits in old age, than you could have done, if your entrance on a religious life had been deferred to that unſeaſonable time.</p>
               <p>THUS may the whole period of your life be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up with eminent ſervice. And I will add, that your beneficial influence may extend far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the circle of your perſonal converſe: you may be bleſſings to your country, indeed to the whole world, by drawing down the favour of God upon it, in part, as a crown of your piety, and an anſwer to your prayers. But,</p>
               <p>On the contrary, if you neglect religion, you will deprive the world of all thoſe benefits, which it may otherwiſe expect from you. If you are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally covetous, you will probably indulge that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy temper, ſo as to with-hold relief from thoſe to whom it is moſt juſtly due<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or if you be of a liberal diſpoſition, your generoſity will degenerate into prodigality; or perhaps you will ſquander away ſo much of your eſtates in vanity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery, as to throw yourſelves out of a capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of aſſiſting thoſe whom you moſt ſincerely pity, and would gladly relieve. And as to the eternal happineſs of others, it is not to be imagined that you will have any regard to it while you are neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent of your own.</p>
               <p>NOR is this the worſt; for, as hardly any are mere cyphers in life, it is much to be feared, that inſtead of bleſſings, you may prove miſchiefs to the world. The licentiouſneſs, to which corrupt nature will prompt you, may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

moſt friendly, it may be moſt pernicious. Inſtead of reſtoring and reclaiming the ſouls of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, you may pervert and deſtroy them by ſinful diſcourſes and impious examples. Thus you may draw down the vengeance of God on the places where you live, and provoke him to ſend ſome pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic calamity, as a puniſhment, for that univerſal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy which you have abetted. So that, (to cloſe the melancholy ſcene) at the bar of God, and in the ſeats of torment, you may meet with multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of unhappy creatures, who will cry out on you, as the fatal cauſe of their ruin in this world, and their condemnation in that.</p>
               <p>BY ſuch a variety of arguments does it appear, that the happineſs of thoſe you converſe with will be conſiderably influenced by your temper and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.

               <p>WHAT I have juſt been ſaying on the former heads, will evidently prove the truth of this obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Your pious parents have a generous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for the happineſs of others, and this will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them earneſtly to wiſh, that you may be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and not curſes to the world about you. And their peculiar affection for you, muſt tenderly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt them in a caſe, on which your happineſs, both in time and eternity, depends.</p>
               <p>IF they ſee you under the influences of early pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, unknown pleaſure will ariſe in their minds: they will rejoice in it, not merely as it will be a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to them of a reſpectful and grateful treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from you; but as it will, through grace, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure

to you, their dear offspring, the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a religious life, and the proſpects of a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious immortality.</p>
               <p>THESE reflections will give them inexpreſſible pleaſure in a variety of circumſtances. Their daily converſe with you will be more agreeable to them, than it could otherwiſe be, when they diſcern the lively impreſſions of religion upon your ſpirits, and perceive that you have a reliſh for thoſe truths and promiſes of the goſpel, which are their joy and ſong in the houſe of their pilgrimage<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Pſal. cxix. 54.</note>.

If they meet with proſperity in their worldly affairs, and have a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of leaving you in plentiful circumſtances, it will be a ſatisfaction to them to think that they ſhall not conſign their eſtates to thoſe who will meanly hoard up the income of them, or throw it away in fooliſh and hurtful luſts; but to perſons who will conſider themſelves as the ſtewards of God, and will endeavour to uſe what God has given them for the

honour of their Lord, and the good of mankind. Or, if they can give you but little, this thought will relieve them, that they commend you to the care of a guardian and a father, who is able abundantly to ſupply your neceſſities, and who has engaged, by the promiſes of his covenant, that thoſe who fear him ſhall want no good thing<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Pſal. xxxiv. 9. lxxxiv. 11.</note>. They will have the pleaſure to think, that, how low ſoever your outward condition may be, you will be rich in grace, and in the entertainments of religion now, and in the glories of the heavenly inheritance at laſt. When they are themſelves ſinking under the decays of nature, their vigour and chearfulneſs will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in yours: or ſhould your parents be impair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an afflictive providence, they will have the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of believing, that thoſe afflictions proceed from a divine love, and ſhall at length turn to your advantage. It will revive their hearts in their dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moments to think, that when they are ſleeping in the duſt, you will ſtand up in their places, and ſupport the intereſt of God in the world, with a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and zeal perhaps ſuperior to theirs. Or if an afflictive ſtroke ſhould take you away before them, they will not mourn over your grave, as thoſe that have no hope<note n="(b)" place="bottom">1 Theſſ. iv. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THIS is but a faint and imperfect deſcription of the ſatisfaction which your parents would find in your early piety.

IT is poſſible that you may arrive at ſuch a dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing degree of wickedneſs, as to treat them with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence and contempt, or perhaps to anſwer all their melting expoſtulations with inſults and rage. Such ungrateful and rebellious monſters we have heard of; and would to God, that every parent in this aſſembly could ſay, that he had only heard of them! But ſhould you preſerve ſome ſenſe of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and decency; nay, ſhould you behave towards them in the moſt dutiful and obliging manner, yet they muſt ſtill mourn over you; and even your ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and complaiſance to them, would ſometimes come in to add a more ſenſible anguiſh to their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. It would cut them to the heart to think, that ſuch dear, and, in other reſpects, amiable chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, were ſtill the enemies of God, and the heirs of deſtruction. When they heard the vengeance of God denounced againſt ſinners, and read the awful threatnings of his word, they would tremble to think, that thoſe terrible thunders were levelled againſt you. How little could they rejoice in that health, or plenty, which they ſaw you were abuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your aggravated ruin! and how would they be terrified when any diſtemper ſeized you, leſt it ſhould be the meſſenger to bear you away to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal miſery! If they were themſelves dying, how mournfully muſt they take their leave of you, in an apprehenſion of ſeeing you no more till the day of accounts, and ſeeing you then in ignominy and horror, at the left hand of the judge! Or if they ſaw you removed by an early death, to what hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſorrows would they be abandoned! With what unknown agonies would they adopt that pathetic la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of David, Oh my ſon Abſalom, my ſon, my ſon Abſalom, would to God I had died for thee!

BY ſuch a variety of conſiderations does it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the comfort and happineſs of your pious parents does very much depend upon your temper and behaviour. And the argument is confirmed by the repeated teſtimony of the wiſeſt of men, under the influences of the divine Spirit. He tells us again and again, that a wiſe ſon maketh a glad fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Prov. x. 1. xv. 20.</note>; that whoſo loveth wiſdom rejoiceth his father<note n="(b)" place="bottom">xxix. 3.</note>; and that the father of the righteous ſhall greatly rejoice; and he that begetteth a wiſe child, ſhall have joy of him<note n="(c)" place="bottom">xxiii. 24</note>. On the other hand, he tells us, that a fooliſh ſon is the heavineſs of his mother<note n="(d)" place="bottom">x. 1.</note>. And though the tenderneſs of her ſex may make the mother peculiarly ſenſible of the affliction, yet it is not confined to her; for he tells us elſewhere, that a fooliſh ſon is a grief to his father, as well as bitterneſs to her that bare him<note n="(e)" place="bottom">xvii. 25.</note>; yea, a fooliſh ſon is the calamity of his father<note n="(f)" place="bottom">xix. 13.</note>.

               <p>SUCH a multitude of paſſages to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes ſeem intended to teach us the importance, as well as the certainty of the argument. And it is more than hinted at in thoſe remarkable words; My ſon, if thy heart be wiſe, my heart ſhall rejoice, even mine<note n="(h)" place="bottom">Prov.

As if he had ſaid, make a ſerious pauſe, and diligently weigh the importance of that thought, that thy piety will be an inexpreſſible joy to me, to thy father. And then, as if that were not enough, it is immediately added, yea, my reins alſo ſhall rejoice, (ſhall feel unutterable pleaſure

               <p>AND let me intreat you, my friends, to reflect for a few moments on the weight of the argument, that you may judge whether it will not bear all the ſtreſs which Solomon lays upon it. The hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of your parents is in queſtion; and can you ſlight that? Conſider how much you owe to your parents, as they were the inſtruments of your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and have been, under God the principal ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of it. Think of the tenderneſs with which they watched around your cradles, and of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kind offices which they performed for you in your helpleſs infancy; which parental tenderneſs made delightful to them, when hardly any thing elſe could have made them tolerable. Think how liberally they have long contributed towards the ſupply of your wants; and in how many inſtances they have denied themſelves, that they might gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify you. Think how they have rejoiced with you in your joys, and mourned with you in your ſorrows; how they have been terrified at your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al dangers; and perhaps often diſquieted with thoſe timorous apprehenſions, which fondneſs, rather than reaſon, has ſuggeſted to them. And under the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of theſe reflections, ſay, whether it may not reaſonably be expected, that you ſhould have a moſt affectionate regard to their repoſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and think with horror of becoming their grief and torment.</p>
               <p>I MAY add, that as the parents of ſome amongſt you are declining under the infirmities of age, and on that account the objects of a reſpectful compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to all, they ſhould be ſo eſpecially to you who
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:046736_0026_1021EF6ED4D65DA8"/>
are their children; for it may be theſe infirmities have been haſtened upon them by an exceſs of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and concern for you. And will you add afflictions to the afflicted, and bring down with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to the grave<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Gen. xlii. 38.</note> thoſe venerable hoary heads which you have perhaps made gray before their time? Surely you muſt abhor the thought, or God and man muſt abhor you.</p>
               <p>But I would not entertain ſo harſh a ſuſpicion; I charitably hope, that you are not only impreſſed with this conſideration, but will likewiſe be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what concerned, when you hear,</p>

               <p>IF we have any thing of humanity and generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in our tempers, we muſt be concerned for your ſeriouſneſs, on account of that influence which it has on the happineſs of all about you, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly on that of your chriſtian parents. Many of them are the ornaments and glory of our aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and the moſt dear and intimate of our friends; we are obliged therefore to take part with them in their ſorrows and their joys, with relation to you their children, It muſt ſenſibly afflict us to ſee, that while their wiſdom and their piety might command the reverence and the love of all that know them, enemies ſhould ariſe up againſt them out of their own houſes, and even the children of

Or muſt we never have the ſatisfaction of converſing with you in private, as our brethren in the Lord, and our companion in the way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?</p>
               <p>WELL might it grieve us to be thus left alone in the midſt of a degenerate world; eſpecially when we reflect, that the cauſe of God was ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the time of our adminiſtration, and ſerious religion was loſt amongſt us, while the cultivation of it was committed to our care. Shall we not be ſuſpected of unfaithfulneſs to God, and to you, if it die in our hands? That were dreadful indeed. May the divine grace preſerve us from that guilt! And I truſt, my brethren, that it will preſerve us; and, in dependence upon that I plainly tell you, that while God continues us in a capacity of doing it, we will honeſtly warn you, we will ſeriouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulate with you, we will earneſtly pray for you; and if it be all in vain, we will appeal to an omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcient God, that your deſtruction is not chargeable upon us, but upon yourſelves.</p>
               <p>BUT in the mean time, it would be dreadful to reflect, that while we are thus endeavouring to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our own ſouls, we are in effect heaping aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated damnation on yours; while every attempt is reſiſted by you, and ſo brings you under a greater load of guilt. You may indeed be inſenſible of the load now, but we foreſee the day when you will ſink under it. And here is the accent of our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; in ſuch views as theſe we fear that when the miniſters of former generations ſhall appear before their judge with a train of happy ſouls; which have been conducted to heaven by their means, it muſt be our melancholy part to ſtand out as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes againſt our hearers, that we have ſtretched

out our hands all the day long to a diſobedient and gainſaying people<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Rom. x. 21</note>. Oh, how ſhall we be able to advance this dreadful teſtimony againſt the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of our deareſt friends, againſt thoſe whom we tenderly loved, and whoſe ſalvation we would have purchaſed with any thing, but our own! yet this is our proſpect with regard to you; and we may leave it to you to judge, whether it muſt not ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den our ſouls.</p>
               <p>Now pardon me, my friends, if I tell you, that we may reaſonably expect, that an argument of this nature ſhould not be deſpiſed. I hope it is no breach of modeſty to ſay, that we have not deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo ill at your hands, as that our joy or our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, ſhould be indifferent to you. In all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon affairs of life we would chearfully ſerve you to the utmoſt of our power, and therefore at leaſt reaſonably expect to ſtand on a level with the reſt of your friends in like circumſtances. And our character as miniſters, if we be careful to anſwer it, give us ſome peculiar claim to your regard. For you we give up many more ſplendid proſpects in life, which, in other employments, we might poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly have ſecured; for you we lay out our time and our ſtrength, in ſtudy, in prayer, and in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. We bear you upon our hearts in our public miniſtrations, and our private retirements; (and God is witneſs with what ſincerity). Nor would we refuſe thoſe laborious ſervices, which, in human probability, might haſten upon us the infirmities of age, and the approach of death, if they might be the happy means of your converſion and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And is this the reward of all our friendly care? to weaken our hands, to grieve our ſouls, and to behave in ſuch a manner, that the more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:046736_0030_1021EF74F4614D40"/>
we love you, the more deeply we muſt be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by you?</p>
               <p>MANY of you treat us with a great deal of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and decency; with the appearances of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and eſteem. You are ready to ſerve us on the common offices of friendſhip, and would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs your reſentment if you ſaw us injured, in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or in words. We thankfully acknowledge your goodneſs in ſuch inſtances as theſe; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit us to aſk you, why you will not be ſo kind and ſo grateful to us, as to take care of your own ſouls, when nothing could oblige us more than ſuch a care, and nothing can afflict us more than the neglect of them? Let me conclude this head with thoſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic words of the apoſtle, if there be any bowels and mercies, fulfil ye your joy<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Phil. ii. 1. 2.</note>. And let me intreat you to conſider, one more,</p>
               <p n="4">4. THAT the propagation of religion to future generations does, under God, chiefly depend upon you.</p>
               <p>FOR this reaſon the pious Iſraelites are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, as reſolving to declare the wonderful works of God unto their children, that the generation to come might know them, even the children that ſhould be born that they might ariſe, and, in their turn declare them unto their children<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Pſalm lxxviii. 4—6.</note>, and ſo the intail might be carried on to the remoteſt ages.</p>
               <p>Now, my brethren, it is evident, that the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of religion to ſucceeding generations does, humanly ſpeaking, depend on you and others, who, with you, are entering upon life. If you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the influences of ſerious godlineſs, you will carry them along with you to the end of your
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:046736_0031_1021EF770E6374D8"/>
days; and when God calls you into families of your own, it will be your deſire that you and your houſes may ſerve him<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Joſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> xxiv. 15.</note>. Family-prayer, and family-inſtruction will be maintained; you will be teaching your children to know the Lord, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting them to ſerve him, and praying for a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on thoſe endeavours: and who knows what a remarkable bleſſing might attend them? Your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, under the impreſſions of ſuch an education, may be eminent for religion as you have been. They may be equally diligent in the care of their poſterity, and God may favour them with equal ſucceſs; and ſo there may be thouſands of your remote deſcendants, who never ſaw you, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps heard of your name, who yet, under God, may owe their religion and their happineſs to you. The proſpect of it may now afford you a ſenſible pleaſure; and it is highly probable that when they meet you in the regions of the inviſible world, ſuch an important obligation may engage them to treat you with peculiar reſpect and affection; as ſurely all other obligations will appear trifling, when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with this.</p>
               <p>ON the other hand, if you neglect religion your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, it cannot be thought you will be much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to tranſmit it to others. You would hardly be at the pains to give them good inſtructions; ſuppoſing you much more capable of doing it than you can expect to be: or if you do attempt it, thoſe inſtructions will be likely to have little effect, when they are contradicted by the daily language of your example. Nay, it is poſſible you may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at ſuch a height of wickedneſs, as directly to oppoſe practical godlineſs, and breed up your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the contempt of it; which is often to be ſeen, even in this chriſtian country. And what do
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:046736_0032_1021EF79054C3F38"/>
you think will become of ſuch children as theſe? If you have been ſo wicked, notwithſtanding all the reſtraints of a ſerious education, what will they be, who miſs of the advantages you enjoyed, and muſt be expoſed to numberleſs temptations from which you were free? Shall theſe be a ſeed to ſerve the Lord? Shall theſe be accounted to him for a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration? It might almoſt as well be expected, that a race of men ſhould ſpring up in a deſart, where no human creature ever appeared before them, as that true chriſtianity ſhould be propogated in the world by children of ſuch an education.</p>
               <p>AND have you, after all, ſo utter an indifference to the honour of that Redeemer, into whoſe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion you were baptized, and whoſe name you bear, as that you could be contented, ſhould it be loſt in the world? Was it for this, that the Son of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from heaven that he might publiſh the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel covenant, and expired on the croſs that he might eſtabliſh it? Was it for this that the pious labours of our anceſtors have tranſmitted this religion to us through ſo many ſucceeding ages; and ſo many martyrs have ſealed it by their ſufferings, and their blood? Was it for this, that our ſacred liberties have been ſo courageouſly aſſerted by the beſt of men, and almoſt miraculouſly defended by the hand of God? For this, that the precious intail ſhould be cut off by us, and this invaluable treaſure, the charge and the glory of ſo many former genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſhould periſh in our hands? That the name of chriſtianity ſhould, for the future, be loſt in the world; or which is altogether as bad, that it ſhould ſink into an empty name, and a lifeleſs circle of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning forms? Yet, humanly ſpeaking, this muſt be the conſequence, if you, and others of the riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generation, will not heartily engage in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="unknown:046736_0033_1021EF7B03652400"/>
SUCH a variety of arguments concur to prove the great importance of the riſing generation. They are ſo plain and ſo weighty, that I cannot but think, that you, my brethren, to whom I have particularly applied them, are in your conſciences convinced, that they are not to be diſputed.</p>
               <p>How that conviction ſhould work, I have not time largely to ſhew you; but if it be ſeriouſly and deeply impreſſed on your minds, you cannot long be at a loſs for proper directions, among ſo many pious friends, and excellent books; eſpecially if you conſult the ſcripture, and ſeek for the teachings of the bleſſed ſpirit. To theſe aſſiſtances I heartily recommend you, and omitting many other reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which would naturally ariſe, ſhall conclude my diſcourſe with one which I ſhall immediately addreſs to another part of my auditory.</p>

How ſolicitous ſhould we be in our endeavours for the religious improvement of the riſing ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, ſince its character appears of ſo great importance!</p>
               <p>WE have all our concern in the thought, but I would particularly recommend it to thoſe of you, who are parents and maſters, or have the education of youth under any other capacities; imagine not, my friends, that it is an inconſiderable charge which is lodged in your hands. Providence has intruſted to you the hopes and the fears, the joys, and the ſorrows, of many hearts and of many families. Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture generations will have reaſon to applaud or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt your memory, as your preſent duty is regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or neglected; and, which is infinitely more, the Father of the Spirits of all fleſh will require a ſtrict

               <p>IT was the unhappy caſe of Agrippa, that though almoſt, he was only almoſt, perſuaded to be a chriſtian<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Acts xxvi. 28.</note>; and I fear, it is now the caſe of many, and particularly of many young per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who have enjoyed the advantages of a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous education. I believe it is difficult to find any amongſt them, who have not been brought under ſome ſerious impreſſions betimes. With regard to the internal operations of the bleſſed ſpirit, as well as external means, the morning of life is generally to them, in a peculiar ſenſe, the day of their viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and they often ſeem to know it, and in ſome meaſure to improve it: but in too many inſtances, we find their goodneſs as a morning cloud, and as the early dew which ſoon paſſeth away<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Hoſ. vi. 4</note>. The bloſſoms open fair and beautiful, and give a very

agreeable proſpect of the plentiful fruits of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in life, but too often when ſtorms of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and corruption ariſe, the goodly appearance is laid in ruins; the bloſſoms do as it were fall to the ground, and leave the tree blaſted and naked; or at beſt only covered over with leaves of an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal profeſſion, which, however green and flouriſhing they may for the preſent be, will not at laſt ſecure it from being cut down, and caſt into the burning. Though they for a while had eſcaped the pollutions of the world through luſt, they are afterwards en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled and ſubdued; and the conſequence is, they prove a ſcandal to religion, and a diſcouragement to others, till, in the end, they bring aggravated deſtruction on themſelves; ſo that on the whole, as the apoſtle moſt juſtly obſerves, it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, than thus, after they have known it, to turn aſide from the holy commandment<note n="(a)" place="bottom">2. Pet. ii. 21.</note>.</p>
               <p>THIS may be in a great meaſure owing to the mutability of human nature in general, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to the livity and inconſiſtency of youth, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the force of thoſe temptations of life which continually ſurround and preſs upon them. Yet I apprehend this is not all, but that it is, in part to be charged on ſomething defective, even in their beſt days, on their reſting in ſomething ſhort of real religion, and a true ſaving change. Solomon had ſeen reaſon to ſay, there is a way that ſeemeth right to a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Prov. xiv. 12.</note>: and I believe every conſiderate perſon will be ready to own, that in order to prevent ſo fatal a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion, and all the train of miſchiefs which may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon it, great care ſhould be taken in ſlating this important queſtion; <q>What is the true and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid baſis, on which we may ſecurely ground our
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:046736_0037_1021EF845A2A16F0"/>
eternal hopes?</q> It is a queſtion of the higheſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and the moſt univerſal concern, both to the aged and the young; ſo that I truſt I need not offer any apology for complying with the requeſt of a pious and judicious friend, who recommended this ſubject to our conſideration, at this time and on this occaſion.</p>
               <p>IN Proſecution of this deſign, I have made choice of theſe words of the apoſtle, which I have now been reading, and which may, without offering any violence to them, be very fairly and naturally accommodated to the preſent purpoſe.</p>
               <p>IT is plain, from many paſſages in this epiſtle, that the great apoſtle, who had planted the chriſtian church among the Galatians, had reaſon to fear, that many, who were by profeſſion its members, were not ſufficiently eſtabliſhed in their holy faith. It is probable, that he himſelf had an oportunity of making but a ſhort ſtay among them; and, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through their own negligence and prejudices, and partly through the artful attempts of falſe teachers in the abſence of St Paul, they appear to have fallen into a ſet of notions, and a conduct, which tended not only to impair the glory, but to ſubvert the very foundation, of the goſpel, and with it the foundation of their own eternal hopes. Of this the apoſtle does, in a very awful manner, admoniſh them. He tells them, in the very beginning of his epiſtle, that he marvelled that they were ſo ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from him that called them, (and from the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples he had taught them) into another goſpel<note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>. i. 6.</note>. And afterwards he uſeth theſe very free and empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical words: O fooliſh Galatians, who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched, or enchanted you, that you ſhould not obey the truth? Are you ſo fooliſh? having begun in the ſpirit (having profeſſed to embrace the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:046736_0038_1021EF85DCF04F58"/>
and ſhewn the appearances of ſome common zeal for it), can you now hope to be made perfect by the fleſh, or by the ritual and carnal obſervances of the Moſaic inſtitution? Is it thus that you diſgrace all you have done, and all you have borne for Chriſt? Have you then ſuffered ſo many things in vain<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Gal. iii. 1—4.</note>? On the whole, he tells them, he was ready to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that all the agreeable hopes, he had at once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained concerning them, would be buried in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting diſappointment, and that it would appear, he had beſtowed upon them labour in vain<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Chap iv. 11.</note>. Thus did he ſtand in doubt of them<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Chap. iv. 20.</note>; and that doubt pierced his heart with the moſt tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, and brought upon him, as it were a ſecond time, thoſe pangs of ſoul which he had felt on their account, when he ſaw them in all the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and wickedneſs of their gentile ſtate. He was hardly more ſolicitous that they might be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from dumb idols to the living God, than he was now, that they might give convincing eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that Chriſt was formed in them, i. e. that they had cordially received and digeſted the goſpel, and that their hearts were delivered into the mould of it<note n="(d)" place="bottom">Rom. vi. 17.</note>; which it did not appear they were, while they were thus making void the grace of God, and the righteouſneſs of faith, by adhering to the fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and pernicious doctrine of the neceſſity of ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their juſtification, in part at leaſt, by the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Moſaic law.</p>
               <p>This ſeems to be the moſt natural ſenſe of the words of the text, where ſuch a latitude of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is uſed, as the apoſtle elſewhere ſeems to ſtudy, on purpoſe to render his writings univerſally edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and uſeful to them, whoſe particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in life are widely different from thoſe of the perſons to whom they were originally addreſſed.
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:046736_0039_1021EF87CF21C398"/>
As to the introductory words, my little children, we cannot imagine they refer to the age of thoſe to whom the apoſtle wrote. The evident deſign of them is, to expreſs that kind of parental ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs which he entertained for them, like that which a mother hath for an infant with which ſhe travails in birth. My little children, of whom I travail in birth again, till Chriſt be formed in you.</p>
               <p>It would be eaſy to multiply obſervations from the words. I might eſpecially take occaſion to ſhew,—that it is poſſible, thoſe that once ſeemed very hopeful, and ſtill maintain an external profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may appear, after all, in ſuch dangerous cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, that judicious miniſters, and other Chriſtian friends, may be thrown into a great deal of perplexity and agony on their account;—and that the great thing neceſſary to eſtabliſh their ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the comfort of thoſe concerned for them, is, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt be formed in them.</p>
               <p>THAT I may more particularly illuſtrate and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the text, and take in what is moſt important in theſe remarks, I will

2. TRUST not to the regularity of your ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in matters of religion, as the foundation of your eternal hopes.</p>
               <p>So various are the workings of men's hearts, and the devices of Satan, that, if I miſtake not, there are ſome that place their conſidence in the ſtrictneſs, and others in the latitude, of their religious opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, but the one, and the other, will appear equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vain, when conſidered in the view now before us.</p>
               <p>Some may poſſibly perſuade themſelves, that their condition is ſecure, becauſe their ſentiments are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox. They live perhaps in the midſt of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing and profane, and ſee daily contempt and deriſion thrown upon the bleſſed goſpel, or its moſt glorious peculiarities; but through the influence of a good education, or from ſome other principle ſhort of true piety, they may nevertheleſs not only hold faſt the faith once delivered to the ſaints, but even contend earneſtly for it<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Jude ver. 3.</note>: nay, they are, perhaps, learned in the controverſies of the times; and can indeed pronounce concerning them in a very rational and accurate manner.</p>

THERE are others who err in the contrary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme. Orthodox notions are their banter, rather than their confidence.

Mere ſelf love might be the foundation of ſuch a joy in the tidings of pardon and happineſs, without the leaſt degree of renewing and ſanctifying grace; as it probably was in thoſe hearers, repreſented by the ſtony ground, who immediately received the word with joy, but had no root, and ſo endured but for a while<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Matt xiii. 20, 21.</note>.</p>
               <p>BUT, perhaps, you will ſay, you are confident it is not merely ſelf-love in you, for you have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten found your mind impreſſed with a grateful ſenſe of the divine Goodneſs; ſo that, when you own it before God in prayer, or converſe with his ſaints on the copious and delightful ſubject, your ſouls flow forth in love to your great benefactor, and you look up to him in the moſt thankful acknowledgements of his favours.—If it be a gratitude, that capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates the ſoul into a willing obedience, and engages you to yield yourſelves living ſacrifices to God, then is Chriſt formed in your ſouls, and you are not the perſons to whom I would give the alarm: on the contrary, I would rather confirm your hopes, and rejoice with you in them.—But if your gratitude does not riſe to this; if it reſt only in ſome tender emotion of mind, or ſome tranſient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal expreſſion of that emotion, I muſt faithfully tell you, that I fear it is only a nobler degree of that natural inſtinct which cauſeth the ox to know his owner, and the aſs his maſter's crib<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Iſa. i. 3.</note>. To find your ſpirit in this manner does indeed plainly prove that the day of your viſitation is not entirely paſt; it proves you have not ſinned yourſelves into utter inſenſibility of ſoul; nay, it may poſſibly at length, through the communications of ſanctifying grace, lead you on to real religion, and to eminent attainments in it: but at preſent it falls far ſhort.

I have often told you, (and one can hardly repeat it too often, or inſiſt too earneſtly upon it,) that there is a very wide difference between a good ſtate, and a good frame; and that religion is not ſeated either in the underſtanding, or in the paſſions, but principally in the will; which, in this disjointed ſtate of human nature, is far from being always in a due harmony with either. So that, on the whole, thoſe illuminations, or thoſe affections, on which you are apt to lay ſo great a ſtreſs, are, perhaps, at beſt, but the preparatory workings of the Spirit upon your minds, which if they are improved aright, may leave you more hard, and more miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable than they found you.</p>

But it will by no means follow from thence, that wherever there is a ſober and virtuous conduct, ſuch a ſoul is paſſed from death to life.

in vain that the notices of his death are publiſhed to us. Beware, I entreat you, of ſo pernicious an error. I think myſelf obliged more earneſtly to caution you againſt it, becauſe, while the devil is attempting, on the one hand, to engage ſome, under the ſpecious pretences of an evangelical ſpirit, to turn the grace of God into wantonneſs<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Jude ver. 4.</note>, he ſeems to be inſnaring others, by extolling the virtue which he hates, in order to lead them into a neglect of Chriſt, and his righteouſneſs, and all the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarities of the goſpel-ſcheme of ſalvation; ſo that it is difficult on the whole to ſay, which of theſe devices is moſt deſtructive to the ſouls of men.</p>

Comparing themſelves with others, or with themſelves in a more licentious and corrupt ſtate, they pronounce a favourable ſentence, and conclude they are ſafe and happy: but let me intreat you, my friends, that you would rather compare your hearts and lives with that perfect law of God which cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed; weigh yourſelves in that balance, and ſee whether you are not found wanting there.

In theſe things he was once ſo weak, and ſo wretched, as to place a great deal of confidence; but when he was illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, and called by divine grace, he aſſures us, that what things were gain unto him before, thoſe he counted loſs for Chriſt, i. e. he moſt entirely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced all dependence upon them. Yea doubtleſs, ſays he, and I count all things but loſs, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord.

               <p>II. I AM to conſider, what will be a ſolid foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for hope and joy when all theſe precarious dependencies fail.</p>
               <p>THIS is, with the utmoſt propriety, expreſſed in the text, by Chriſt formed in the ſoul; which is exactly parrallel to that phraſe in Coloſſians, Chriſt in you, the hope of glory<note n="(d)" place="bottom">Col. i. 27.</note>, which is there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as an epitome of the goſpel, the riches of the glory of the myſtery preached among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. When Paul could ſee that the Galatians
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:046736_0053_1021EFA52D9CE910"/>
were brought to this, the pangs of his labouring mind would be ended, and joy and confidence would ſucceed; which is plainly intimated in the words of the text. And when you, my dear charge, are brought to it, parents and miniſters may rejoice over you, and you will have an everlaſting ſpring of hope and joy, a ſolid foundation on which to build for eternity.</p>
               <p>PERMIT me, therefore, a little more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to explain it to you; and let me intreat you to turn your thoughts inward, that you may judge whether you have been experimentally acquainted with the temper and change which I ſhall now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, as ſignified by this remarkable expreſſion in the text, Chriſt formed in you.</p>
               <p>Now, I think, it implies theſe three things:—That ſome apprehenſions of Chriſt have taken hold of the heart; that the man is brought to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit choice of him, and deliberately enters into covenant with him;—and that, in conſequence of both theſe, ſomething of the temper and ſpirit of Chriſt is, by divine grace wrought in his ſoul.

The man in whoſe heart Chriſt is formed, has ſeen himſelf condemned by God's righteous law; has ſeen himſelf equally unable to anſwer its demands, or to bear up under the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of its penalties. And feeling this to be no light matter, but the very life of his own ſoul, he has then been engaged with the greateſt ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and earneſtneſs, to cry out, Woe is me, for I am undone<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Iſa. vi. 5.</note>! Oh what ſhall I do to be ſaved<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Acts xvi. 30.</note>? I before told you, there may be theſe convictions and awakenings, where Chriſt is never formed in the ſoul; and I now add, that the degree of them may be various, according to the various tempers and circumſtances of different perſons: but it is moſt evident, that ſomething of this kind muſt make way for the Redeemer's entrance, who comes to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt<note n="(d)" place="bottom">Luke xix. 10.</note>; to bind up the broken-hearted<note n="(e)" place="bottom">Iſa. lxi. 1.</note>; and to give reſt to the weary and heavy-laden<note n="(f)" place="bottom">Matt. xi. 28, 29.</note>. And I the rather inſiſt on this; becauſe I am fully perſuaded, that ſlight thoughts of ſin, and of the miſery of our natural eſtate by it, have been the principal cauſe of all the infidelity of the preſent age, and are daily ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ining a multitude of ſouls.</p>

               <p n="1">1. How important is it, that miniſters ſhould lead young perſons into ſuch views as theſe!</p>
               <p>OUR great and important buſineſs in life is to promote the eternal happineſs of our hearers, and to lay a ſolid foundation of hope and joy in their ſouls. We have ſeen now what it is, and other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jeſus Chriſt<note n="(a)" place="bottom">1 Cor. iii. 11.</note>. Here then let all our labours centre. It is the good old way, in which our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the miniſtry went, and in which they proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered. Let us follow their ſteps, and exert our moſt vigorous efforts here. Modern refinements may amuſe us in our cloſets, but they will never feed the ſouls of our hearers, nor ſpread the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs of a goſpel, which was the power of God to the ſalvation of thouſands, before they were ever dreamt of. I hope, God is my witneſs, that I am heartily concerned for the intereſt of virtue, (if by that be meant the advancement of practical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion); but I never expected to ſee it promoted by the moſt philoſophical ſpeculations concerning its nature, or the fineſt harrangues of it's innate beauties, when the names and peculiar doctrines of Chriſt are thrown off, as unfaſhionable incumbranc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of a diſcourſe. Experienced chriſtians, who have taſted the bread of life, will not contentedly be put off with ſuch chaff: and if we imagine that the younger part of our auditors may be trained

up to a reliſh for it, we may, perhaps, ſucceed in the attempt: but I much fear, that ſucceſs will be the calamity of the church, and the deſtruction of ſouls<note n="*" place="bottom">The author has taken a greater freedom on this head, as the diſcourſe was delivered before ſeveral <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. WE may learn from hence, what are the moſt valuable proofs of parental affection.</p>
               <p>CERTAINLY there is no reaſon to eſteem, as ſuch that fond indulgence which ſuffers ill habits to grow up in the young mind, and fears it's preſent diſturbance more than its future ruin: no, nor yet the more prudent care of providing plentiful and agreeable accommodations, for the ſubſiſtance and delight of your infant offspring, as they advance to maturity and ſettlement in life. Theſe things indeed are not to be neglected; but wretched are the children, and I will add, the parents too, where this is the principle labour. Would you expreſs a wiſe and religious tenderneſs, for which your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhall have reaſon to thank you in their dying moments, and to meet you with joy in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>views of the eternal world? do your utmoſt that Chriſt be formed in their ſouls; and let them plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee, that you even travail in birth again, till this happy work be accompliſhed. But this leads me to add,</p>
               <p n="3">3. WHAT need is there of the work of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit on the heart, in order to the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this great foundation?</p>
               <p>THE language of the text, which ſpeaks of Chriſt formed in us, naturally leads our thoughts
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:046736_0061_1021EFB52392A4C8"/>
to ſome agent, by whom the work is done; and when you conſider what kind of a work it is, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to your own conſciences, whether it is to be thought merely a human production? Were it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a name, a ceremony, a ſpeculation, or a paſſion, it would not be worth a moment's diſpute, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you or we ſhould have the glory of it. But as it is nothing leſs than the transformation of a corrupt and degenerate creature into the holy image of the ſon of God, it were impiety for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to arrogate it to ourſelves.</p>
               <p>LET us therefore, on the whole, learn our duty and our wiſdom. Let the matter be brought to a ſerious and immediate review, and let us judge our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the character deſcribed, as thoſe that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect very ſhortly to be judged of the Lord.—If, on the examination, any of you have reaſon to conclude that you are ſtrangers to it, remember that the invinceable battery of the word of God demoliſhes all the towering hopes you may have raiſed on any other foundation. Let conſcience then ſay, whether any amuſement, or any buſineſs in life, be ſo important, as to be attended to, even for one ſingle day, in neglect of this great concern, on which all the happineſs of an immortal ſoul is ſuſpended. If nothing be indeed found of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er moment, apply yourſelves ſeriouſly to this, and omit no proper and rational method of ſecuring it. Conſider the ways by which Chriſt uſes to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a ſoul, and wait upon him in thoſe ways. Reflect ſeriouſly on your preſent condition; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly attend the inſtructions of his word, and the other ſolemnities of his worſhip; and chuſe to converſe intimately with thoſe, in whom you have reaſon to think he is already formed. But in all remember, that the ſucceſs depends upon a divine co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation, and therefore go frequently into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God by prayer; go into it this day, or if
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:046736_0062_1021EFB74AB539E8"/>
poſſible this hour, and importunately intreat the regenerating and ſanctifying influences of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which when you earneſtly deſire them, the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel gives you ſuch ample encouragement to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.—But if you have reaſon to hope, that you have already received them, learn to what the praiſe ſhould be aſcribed; and let it animate you to pray, that through farther communications from the throne of grace, you may be made continually more and more like to your Redeemer, till you are prepared for that world, where you ſhall ſhine forth in his complete reſemblance, and ſhall find it your complete and eternal felicity.

               <p>IF we have any regard to the judgment of the wiſeſt of men, illuminated and directed by the influences of the divine ſpirit, we muſt certainly own, that ill company is a very dangerous ſnare, and that young perſons ſhould be frequently and earneſtly cautioned againſt it.

And as the ſacred author well knew, that he ſhould plead the cauſe of wiſdom and piety in vain, while the voice of diſſolute companions was heard, and their converſation purſued, he begins his addreſſes to youth with repeated cautions on this head: My ſon, ſays he, if ſinners entice thee, conſent thou not<note n="(b)" place="bottom">ver. 10.</note>.

As he proceeds in his diſcourſe, the addreſs grows more lively and earneſt; and I am ſure every atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive hearer will ſoon diſcover a peculiar ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy in the words of the text. This faithful and compaſſionate counſellor doth not content himſelf with diſſuading his young reader from joining with notorious offenders in their crimes, but even from going in the way with them, or with any other evil men; nay, from entering upon it, or even approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, ſo much as to paſs by it, if there were not a neceſſity of doing it. Enter not into the paths of ſinners, and go not in the way of evil men: avoid it, paſs not by it, turn from it, and paſs away. As if he ſhould have ſaid, <q>ſhun the very place where ſuch wretches aſſemble, as you would if it were infected with the moſt malignant and dangerous diſeaſe: and if you have unwarily taken any ſteps towards it, ſtop ſhort, and direct your courſe another way.</q>
               </p>
               <p>SUCH leſſons did Solomon teach; and ſuch had he himſelf learnt from David his father. That pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous prince, in the very entrance on the book of Pſalms deſcribes the good man as one that walketh not in the counſel of the ungodly, nor ſtanding in the way of ſinners, nor ſitteth in the ſeat of the ſcornful<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Pſal. i. 1.</note>. and he elſewhere ſpeaks of the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen of Zion, as one in whoſe eyes a vile perſon, far from being choſen as an intimate companion, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, while he honours them that fear the Lord<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Pſal. xv. 4.</note>. Thus he delineates the holy and happy man; and he had a pleaſing conſciousneſs that this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter was his own: he therefore appeals to God as a witneſs to it, that he had not himſelf ſat with vain perſons, and was determined that he would not go in with diſſemblers; nay, that he was ſo far from ſeeking and delighting in their company, that he hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

the congregation of evil-doers, and would not ſit with the wicked<note n="(a)" place="bottom">pſal. xxvi. 4, 5.</note>: he reſolutely drove them away from him, as one who knew their ſociety would be extremently injurious to the purpoſe he had formed of devoting himſelf to a religious courſe: depart from me, ye evil-doers; for I will keep the commandments of my God<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Pſal. cxix. 115.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE ſacred writers of the new teſtament recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to us, that we ſhould have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of darkneſs<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Eph. v. 11.</note>; that we ſhould not be unequally yoked in any kind of intimate friendſhip with unbelievers<note n="(d)" place="bottom">2 Cor. vi. 14.</note>; and that if any do not obey the word, we ſhould note ſuch an one, and have no company with him, that he may be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note n="(e)" place="bottom">2 Theſ. iii. 14.</note>.</p>
               <p>CONSIDERING ſuch paſſages of ſcripture, as well as the reaſon of the thing, I think it proper at this time to purſue this ſubject at large. I well know, that I may ſucceed in this particular addreſs and yet leave you ſtrangers to a ſaving change, and far from the kingdom of God; but if I cannot prevail with you to refrain from, and diſcard the company of ſinners, I fear other admonitions will turn to very little account.

AND here ſurely I need not be large in telling you what I mean by bad company. It is, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, <q>the converſation of thoſe, who are apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtitute of the fear of God;</q> and ſo it takes in, not only perſons of the moſt diſſolute and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned characters, but thoſe vain and worthleſs crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures who manifeſt a neglect of religion, though free from groſs and ſcandalous immoralities. So that what I have to ſay will be applicable to all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful companions whatever; but the more notorious their vices are, the more evident will be the force of each of thoſe arguments, by which I ſhall now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to fortify you againſt their ſociety.</p>
               <p>NEITHER ſhall I uſe many words in telling you how far you are to avoid ſuch company; for to be ſure you cannot imagine that I am endeavouring to diſſuade you from a neceſſary commerce with them in the common affairs of life, and the buſineſs of your calling; ſince then, as the apoſtle expreſſes it, you muſt needs go out of the world<note n="(a)" place="bottom">1 Cor. v. 10.</note>, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtate of religion and mortality in it. Nor would I lead you to a neglect of any offices of humanity and civility to them; for ſuch a behaviour, inſtead of adorning the goſpel, would greatly preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice their minds againſt it. Leaſt of all, would I hinder you from applying yourſelves to them by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious admonitions, in order to convince them of their ſin and danger, and to engage them to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and reformation.

               <p>WHEN I call this the moſt difficult part of my work, it is not becauſe I am at a loſs for arguments, or apprehend thoſe arguments to be either weak or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure. A variety of conſiderations immediately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves to my mind, ſo plain, and yet so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, that I am confident were the matter to be weighed in an equal balance, a few moments would be ſufficient to produce a rational conviction of what I am to prove. But oh, who can anſwer for the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of ſuch a conviction? When I conſider the unaccountable inchantment which there ſeems to be in ſuch company as I am warning you againſt; and reflect on the inſtances, in which I have ſeen young perſons of ſenſe and education, who once appeared to promiſe remarkably well, at length entangled, and ſome of them ruined by it; I dare not preſume on the ſucceſs I might otherwiſe expect.

               <p>GIVE me leave then to beſpeak the moſt ſerious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of all that hear me, and eſpecially of the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of my audience, while I urge on your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences ſuch conſiderations as theſe—Seriouſly reflect on the many unhappy conſequences which will attend your going in the way of ſinners;—Think on thoſe entertainments and pleaſures which you give up for the ſake of their ſociety: and conſider how little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage you can expect from thence, to counter-ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the pleaſures you reſign, and the evils you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur by it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. LET me intreat you ſeriouſly to reflect on the many unhappy conſequences which will attend your entering into the path of the wicked, and going in the way of evil men.</p>
               <p>YOU probably will by this means quickly wear out all ſerious impreſſions;—you will be expoſed to numberleſs temptations to ſin and folly,—and thrown out of the way of amendment and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;—and thus will be led into a great many temporal inconveniences,—till at laſt you periſh with your ſinful companions, and have your eternal portion amongſt them in hell.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) BY this means you will be in the ready way to loſe all ſenſe of religion, and out-grow the impreſſions of a ſerious education, if provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence have favoured you with it.</p>

If theſe are duly improved, they will end in converſion and glory; but, if they are reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they lead to greater obſtinacy in ſin, and throw the ſoul ſtill farther from the kingdom of God.

               <p>I AM perſauded, that if they, who are under ſome prevailing ſenſe of divine things, conſider how difficult they often find it to preſerve thoſe impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions on their ſpirits, in the company of ſome who appear on the whole to be ſerious people, even they will be afraid frequently to venture into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the ſenſual and profane.

               <p>IT is no ſmall evil for an immortal creature, who was ſent into the world to ſerve God, and to ſecure a happy immortality, to live in vain, and trifle away hour after hour, in mere idleneſs and impertinence. Yet this is the leaſt ſin that bad company leads a man into. Unhappy as this is, would to God that it always reſted here! the world would at leaſt be more peaceful, and your damnation, ſinners, would be leſs intolerable. But daily obſervation undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably proves, that by evil examples, and wicked com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, people generally learn gluttony and drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs, ſwearing and uncleanneſs. It engages them in fooliſh quarrels, in which they blaſpheme the name of God, and injure their neighbour; and it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituates them to ſuch extravagant ways of living, as they are forced to ſupport by ſecret diſhoneſty, and very often by open robbery. Thus they gradually fall into thoſe ſcandalous enormities, which at firſt they could not have thought of without horror.
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:046736_0072_1021EFCC29D1A488"/>
Thia fatal effect is plainly hinted at in Proverbs, where the wretch that abandoned himſelf to the ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of ſinners, is repreſented as acknowledging, that he was almoſt in all evil, in the midſt of the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and aſſembly<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Prov. v. 14.</note>; i. e. he was ſo hardened in his various crimes, as not to be aſhamed to commit, or at leaſt to avow them in the moſt public manner.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) BY frequenting ſinful company, you will throw yourſelves out of the way of repentance and reformation.</p>
               <p>I BEFORE obſerved, that you will by this means contract a diſreliſh for the exerciſes of devotion; and this will probably be attended with the neglect of thoſe ordinances, which God hath appointed as the great means of our converſion and edification. And when theſe are neglected, how can you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that God ſhould purſue you with uncommon interpoſitions of his grace? That when his word is deſpiſed, and his houſe forſaken, he ſhould ſeize you as it were by violence, amongſt your diſſolute companions, and convert you in your midnight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels? Your pious friends may indeed have ſome op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities in private of expoſtulating with you; but it will require a great deal of reſolution to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it; and when they do, they muſt take it as a peculiar favour, if you give them a patient hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and don't affront and revile them for their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable endeavour of delivering your ſouls from the pit of deſtruction, and plucking you as brand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

upon your minds by it, it is very probable all theſe convictions will wear off, as ſoon as you return to your wicked companions again. One gay, licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hour amongſt them may undo the labour of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny days and weeks, and preſently teach you to laugh at yourſelf for the former alarm, as if every fear had been vain, and every purpoſe of reformation need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. And thus your hearts, will be like temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſteel, which gathers ſtrength from every blow of the hammer, to make a more vigorous reſiſtance to the next; and you will harden to all the moſt mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying methods of providence and of grace, till at length you provoke the bleſſed ſpirit, ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, entirely to withdraw, and ſo you be ſealed up under final impenitency. Thus the poor fooliſh creature I mentioned before, who was ſo fond of the ſociety of ſinners, is repreſented as reflecting too late that all the wiſeſt and kindeſt endeavours of his friends, for his reformation, had been utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual. How, ſays he, have I hated inſtruction, and my heart deſpiſed reproof! I have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined my ear to them that inſtructed me<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Prov. v. 12, 13.</note>.

               <p n="4">(4) YOU will undoubtedly find yourſelves expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a great deal of preſent inconvenience and calamity, with regard to your temporal aſſairs.</p>

before obſerved, that by frequenting ill company, you will be under ſtrong temptations to idleneſs. And thus you will in all probability, waſte your ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and ſhorten your days; and in the mean time lay a foundation for many diſeaſes, which may give you an utter diſreliſh for all the comforts and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments of life, when you ſtand in the greateſt need of relief from them. I add, that it is not at all unlikely, that the fooliſh quarrels, into which it may lead you, may be attended with coſt or pain, and perhaps with both. And as for your reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which to a generous ſpirit is one of the deareſt of all temporal enjoyments, I muſt plainly tell you, that if you determine to take no care in the choice of your company, you muſt neceſſarily give it up. For if, almoſt by a miracle, you ſhould be kept from running, with your ſinful aſſociates, into the ſame exceſs of riot and folly; yet the very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of taking pleaſure in ſuch ſort of compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will be enough to overthrow it, in the judgment of wiſe and conſiderate people.</p>
               <p>SUCH arguments as theſe does Solomon uſe, when cautioning his young readers againſt ſo dangerous an entanglement. He pleads the many temporal inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences and evils which attend it, and many of which I have juſt been mentioning. He obſerves, that it tends to impoveriſh them: he that follows after vain perſons, ſhall have poverty enough<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Prov. xxviii. 19.</note>: that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may ſeem the cement of friendſhip, it often proves the occaſion of enmity and contention<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Chap. xxiii. 29, 30.</note>; for who hath woe? who hath ſorrow? who hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions? who hath babblings? who hath wounds without cauſe? who hath redneſs of eyes? They that tarry long at the wine with the partners of their midnight debaucheries. How much the health is impared by it, is evidently ſuggeſted, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:046736_0075_1021EFD1CE403568"/>
the poor creature as mourning at laſt, when his fleſh and his body are conſumed<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Prov. v. 11.</note>; and to add no more, he expreſsly tells us, that ſinners, by theſe kinds of confederacies, lay ſnares for their own blood, and lurk privily for their own lives<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Prov. i. 18.</note>; which he uſeth as an argument againſt complying with their propoſals, when they ſeem moſt advantagious. And accordingly we ſee, that moſt of theſe unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py creatures, who are the victims of public juſtice, and fall by the hand of the executioner, declare with their dying breath, that wicked company was the occaſion of their ruin.</p>
               <p n="5">(5) IF you chuſe the ſociety of ſinners, you will probably periſh with them, and have their company in hell, as you have had it upon earth.</p>
               <p>THE probability of this dreadful conſequence is but too apparent from what I have ſaid under the former heads of this diſcourſe. If you loſe thoſe religious impreſſions which were early made, if you are drawn into a great deal of ſin, and thrown out of the way of repentance and reformation, what can the end of theſe things be? Or what can you rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably expect, but that God ſhould execute upon you all the fierceneſs of his wrath? And to cut off your vain, preſumptuous hopes, and awaken you to that ſenſe of danger, which is ſo abſolutely neceſſary for your deliverance, he has expreſsly threatened it; and that not only in general with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to all ſinners, but particularly to ſuch as are fond of wicked company. And it is worth your while to obſerve, in what language he threatens it: a companion of fools ſhall be deſtroyed<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Prov. xiii. 20.</note>. So that what Solomon ſays of one ſort of ſinful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:046736_0076_1021EFD3E13626C8"/>
is juſtly applicable to the reſt. Their houſe is the way to hell, going down to the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of death<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Prov. vii. 27.</note>.</p>
               <p>Now let me intreat you to dwell upon this thought, till you feel ſomething of the weight and the terror of it. Be ſometimes aſking yourſelves, <q>How can we dwell with the devouring fire? How can we lie down in everlaſting burnings<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Iſa. xxxiii. 14.</note>?</q> How can you endure thoſe torments youſelves? And in what temper, and with what reflections, will you meet the partners of your guilt and folly there? And in what manner will you converſe together? Alas, my friends, in thoſe ſeats of horror and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, all that rendered your intercourſe on earth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful, will be come to an eternal period. There will be no opportunities for you and them to gratify your ſenſual deſires together: no delicious food, no intoxicating liquors, no gay tales, no chearful ſongs; but inſtead of theſe, blackneſs of darkneſs for ever more<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Jude, ver. 13.</note>; weeping and wailing, and gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of teeth<note n="(d)" place="bottom">Matt. viii. 12.</note>; the worm that never dies, and the fire that cannot be quenched<note n="(e)" place="bottom">Mark ix. 44, 46, 48.</note>.</p>
               <p>WILL it then be any relief to you, to look back on thoſe days, which you ſhared in luxury, and in ſin? Will your friendſhip ſtill continue? And will you be endeavouring by tender condolences, and by obliging offices, to mollify and alleviate the miſeries of each other? Alas, ſinners, Hell is not the ſeat of friendſhip, but of everlaſting enmity and rage. All the wretched inhabitants will live in perpetual diſcord, and mutual abhorrence. And no doubt your keeneſt reſentments will burn againſt thoſe, who have been your partners in ſin; as your aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated damnation will be in part owing to them. And on the ſame principles, will their indignations

And perhaps it is the only inſtance, in which your deſires and your attempts will be effectual. Oh! ſirs, when I think of the air and form of ſome wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed creatures, when tranſported with paſſion, when I obſerve how venomous their ſpeeches, and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly furious all their actions are, methinks I ſee the moſt lively emblem of the ſociety below: but alas, how much more dreadful muſt it be, to ſtand expoſed to the rage and revenge of a damned ſpirit! yet this is like to be your lot; and if it be, the moſt delightful of your companions in ſin, will proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly prove your fierceſt tormentors.</p>
               <p>THERE is reaſon to apprehend, that theſe, and ſuch as theſe, will be the miſerable conſequences of wicked company with regard to yourſelves. And I might now infer from hence, that your frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it muſt be very grievous and injurious to others. I might plead againſt it at large, from the alarms and ſorrows to which your parents and miniſters will be expoſed by your purſuing it, and the miſchievous influence it may have on the circumſtances and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of your own domeſticks, if ever you appear as heads of families, as well as of many others, with whom you be concerned.

Your own conſciences tell you, that if he were ever found amongſt you, it would only be, as a phyſician viſits an hoſpital, to cure others, not to delight himſelf. And why ſhould you eſteem that ſociety unworthy your regard, which, you are ſure, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt would prefer?

Nor will you there only meet your pious friends, with whom on earth you took ſweet counſel together, and perhaps went to the houſe of God in company<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Pſal. lv. 14.</note>; but you will form many new acquaintances with the moſt excellent and glorious of created beings; you will come to the innumerable company of angels, and to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of juſt men made perfect; nay, you will dwell for ever with God the judge of all, and Jeſus the mediator of the new covenant<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Heb. xii. 22, 23, 24.</note>. But ſurely you cannot expect a favourable reception into that bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed world, or any of the preparatory felicities I have been deſcribing, if you reſolutely adhere to fooliſh and wicked companions now. David would not have preſumed to pray, as he doth, Gather not my ſoul with ſinners, if he could not have ſaid, as in the preceding words, I have not ſat with vain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, neither will I go in with diſſemblers; I have hated the congregation of evil-doers, and will not ſit with the wicked<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Pſal. xxvi. 4, 5, 9.</note>.

And now ſhew us, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you, the worthy prize; tell us what thoſe friends are, whoſe company you purchaſe at ſo dear a rate; and what important offices they can do for you, to make you amends for all you muſt loſe, and for all you muſt ſuffer, on their account? Poor wretches! the moſt they can do, is to adminiſter ſomething which may gratify your appetite, or amuſe your imagination for a few tranſient moments. A reliſhing meal, a cheerful cup, a thoughtleſs, noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy burſt of laughter, are ſome of the beſt things they can procure for you. And are theſe ſo great?

But if the ſatisfaction it gave were ever ſo tranſporting, or ever ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, yet ſtill it would be very contemptible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its duration is ſo ſhort. Death is continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advancing towards you, which will very ſhortly ſeparate you from your choſen companions; and if the moſt beloved of them were waiting round your bed, they could by no means deliver you from the grave, or moderate the agonies which were bringing you thither. Even before your trembling ſouls are diſlodged from your bodies, your reliſh for their converſe will be entirely ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo that you would think yourſelves barbarouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſulted by them, if, in the midſt of your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh

               <p>I FIRMLY believe, that, upon ſuch reflections as theſe, you muſt be compelled, even to your own condemnation, to confeſs, that, as Solomon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, He that followeth vain perſons, is void of underſtanding<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Prov. xii. 11.</note>. And if you are convinced of it, then let me intreat you, my dear unhappy friends, who are entangled in this fatal ſnare, that, in the ſtrength of divine grace, you would immediately attempt an eſcape. It will indeed require reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but, remember, it will amply reward it: and therefore determine upon it this day, that you will go no more to their aſſemblies of vanity, and of ſin; and when they would entice you, conſent not to them<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Prov. i. 10.</note>; but rather tell them plainly and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, that you know, and conſider, that your ſouls are at ſtake; and tell them, you avoid their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny now, becauſe you dread it in hell. And who knows, but ſuch a ſerious and lively admonition from thoſe who were once their brethren in iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, may do more to awaken them, than many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes from the pulpit? Who knows, but it may effectually reclaim them, and be a means of forming them to ſuch characters, as may make their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip as ſafe and as honourable, as ever it was dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and infamous?

               <p>AND here I would obſerve, that your care muſt begin very early, and that it muſt take a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs. You ſhould endeavour betimes to lay in an antidote againſt the future poiſon, by labouring to the utmoſt to poſſeſs their infant minds with a ſenſe of the divine preſence, a deſire of pleaſing God, and a dread of offending him.

they are to be found. And if you ſee they begin to form an acquaintance with ſuch as you think likely to inſnare and corrupt them, firſt gently warn them of it, and endeavour by the eaſieſt methods to draw them off: if thoſe will not do, reaſon with them more largely on the head; lay before them the various dangers they will be expoſed to, and ſhew them the inſtances of thoſe who have been injured and ruined by ſuch company: inſtances, which, it is to be feared, you will always have near at hand: and if all this be not enough, interpoſe with the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority God has given you; abſolutely forbid them the place and company, and let them ſee, by your after-conduct, that you are in good earneſt in the prohibition. At the ſame time, endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend religion to them in the moſt amiable light, that they may be convinced it carries its entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment along with it, ſo that there is no need of ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pleaſure in the paths of the deſtroyer. I know this is a matter of difficulty, and requires a great deal of prudence and ſteadineſs to conduct it aright; but I am perſuaded, if parents and maſters were careful in this reſpect, few would be ruined till they came to be at their own diſpoſal, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of multitudes would be intirely prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

               <p>IT is evident, that, as all bad company is danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſo the nearer it is to us, and the more frequent the opportunities of converſing with it, the greater miſchief will it probably do us. Thoſe who are in

What then could you expect, if you had thoſe, not only in your houſes, but in your arms too, from whom you would hardly ever hear a ſerious word; and who would perhaps be unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to give you the hearing, if you ſhould attempt any ſuch diſcourſe: nay, might poſſibly revile or banter you for it, and, by their impious language, and wicked example, might greatly deaden religious ſentiments in your heart, and either prevent or fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate your endeavours or communicating them to thoſe under your care? When chriſtians of one ſex or the other, chuſe ſuch a companion for life, they ſeem to lie under great difficulties, and will be in imminent danger, either, on the one hand, of fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a due affection and regard, or on the other, of being perverted and enſnared by that very affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which both the duties of the relation, and the comfort of life ſo evidently require. If any of you have taken this hazardous ſtep, I have nothing to do but to adviſe you, to be daily looking up to God for that extraordinary prudence which your cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances require. But this is ſuch a ſituation, that I cannot forbear praying, that, as for thoſe of you who are yet ſingle, no conſiderations of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wit, temper, or fortune, may ever prevail upon you to bow your necks to ſo unequal a yoke.</p>

And, in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them for farther favours, he promiſes, in the words of the text, to pour out upon them an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant effuſion of the bleſſed ſpirit. Now we well know, by a multitude of ſcriptures, which I muſt not particularly enumerate, that it was to be in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Thus ſhould the ſouls of the children flouriſh, through the divine bleſſing, on the inſtructions of pious pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and other methods appointed by God for their religious improvement. And in the next words the prophet uſes ſtill greater plainneſs of ſpeech, to let us know that their number ſhould be conſiderable, and their reſolutions for God firm and determinate. One and another, this man and that, ſhould come and own his relation to God, ſhould publicly enter himſelf into the engagements of his covenant, and put in an humble claim to the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant bleſſing it was intended to convey.

               <p>AND, before I enter on theſe, I muſt intreat you to remember, that it is to religious youth only, that I addreſs the invitation. I well know, my friends, that the ſacred inſtitution I am now recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is a moſt awful and ſolemn thing.

I am very ſenſible that for any to approach it in ſo unworthy a manner, is not only in itſelf a ſinful action, but may, in its conſequences, prove a ſnare to their own ſouls, a ſtumbling to others, and a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to the church. And therefore, far from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging ſuch perſons to come, I ſhould think it a very neceſſary duty to labour to the utmoſt to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade them from it, and, if providence gave me an opportunity, to prevent their admittance.</p>

                  </gap> I have frequently found, and I believe it has been the experience of many of my brethren in the miniſtry, that young perſons, not only of a very ſober and regular conduct, but even thoſe who have appeared moſt deeply impreſſed with the concerns of their ſouls, and experimentally acquainted, ſo far as we can judge, with regenerating grace, have, in many inſtances, ſhewn a ſtrange coldneſs to this bleſſed inſtitution; and we have known not a few who have grown old in the neglect of it. I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend therefore, that a regard to the authority and glory of my great maſter, to the comfort and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of your ſouls, and to the edification and joy of the church in general, concur to require, that I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>AND here permit me more largely to plead the weight of a dying Redeemer's command, as well as the honour, the pleaſure, and the various advantages of an early compliance with it.</p>

I NEED not enlarge on the proof of what is ſo apparent. You undoubtedly know that Matthew and Mark, and Luke, agree in giving us the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of its inſtitution<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Matt. xxvi. 26—27. Mark xiv. 22—24.

                  </note>, and accordingly relates it in a very cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial and pathetic manner; telling us not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that Chriſt commanded that this ſhould be done in remembrance of him, but alſo that, by an attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon it, our Lord's death is ſhewed forth till he come; plainly intimating thereby, (what the ends of the ordinance do farther evince), that it was to continue in the church to its remoteſt ages. So that, on the whole, you exceedingly miſtake if you imagine this to be mere matter of choice, in any other ſenſe, than as all the duty of a rational creature is ſo. Our Lord has plainly determined the matter by his own ſacred authority, leaving this ordinance in charge to all his followers. I ſay to all, for there is no limitation as to the age of thoſe that ſhould attend it. It is a command to young and old, as well as to rich and poor; and all, that are capable of underſtanding it, are obliged to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with it, and thereby to do their homage to their exalted ſovereign, and expreſs their gratitude to their moſt generous friend. And can you in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon refuſe your compliance? Methinks the name of the ſon of God ſhould carry along with it an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority too great to be deſpiſed, and the name of your redeemer a conſtraining love too forcible to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Surely, my friends, if a dying parent, or bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, had given you a charge almoſt with his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring breath, you could not lightly have acted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it. How much greater regard do you
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:046736_0097_1021EFFF71429498"/>
owe to what the bleſſed Jeſus appointed (as the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle moſt pertinently obſerves (the ſame night in which he was betrayed<note n="(a)" place="bottom">1 Cor xi. 23.</note>! Had it been ſome hard thing that he had then enjoined, and had the reaſon of it been unknown, ſo that it had appeared as a mere arbitrary conſtitution, the neglect of it had been fooliſh and ungrateful. Had it been a more painful rite than that of initiation amongſt the Jews, more laborious than their frequent jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to Jeruſalem, and more coſtly than the ſacrific<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es they offered there, the precept of our dying Lord had carried in it an abundant anſwer to all that eaſe or intereſt could have pleaded againſt it: how much more, when the reaſon is ſo evident, and the obſervation, in all reſpects, ſo eaſy! Judge, I pray you, whether it would be neglected. Judge, whether it be a decent thing, that when we are ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down to break and eat bread, and to pour forth and drink wine, that we may repreſent the breaking of Chriſt's body, and the pouring forth of his blood, and ſeal our covenant-engagements with him, more than one half of the profeſſing, chriſtians in the aſſembly ſhould riſe, and either leave the place, or withdraw to a diſtance from the holy table. What is this but to ſay, <q>We will now have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with the memorials of a crucified Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour?</q> Will you, my friends, thus ſeperate your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from us? What if others were to learn of you, and to imitate your example? Where would the ordinance quickly be? Nay, where would it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready have been, had this temper prevailed?

2. AN early attendance upon this ordinance will be truly honourable to you.</p>
               <p>I WISH I could ſay that the omiſſion of it were, in the repute of the generality of profeſſing chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, ſo diſhonourable as it ought; but it is now grown ſo common, that much of the juſt infamy of it is worn off. Nevertheleſs, if we will ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider it, we muſt own, that where reaſon and duty require any practice, (which I have already proved to be the caſe here,) the more frequently it is neglected, the more honourable is a regard to it; as it argues a laudable fortitude of mind, to oppoſe a prevailing evil, by which multitudes are borne away. And who, that hath any ſenſe of generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and goodneſs, would not wiſh to ſignalize him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on ſuch an occaſion as this?</p>
               <p>I APPEAL to your own hearts, my brethren, even when you have diveſted yourſelves of every ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of oſtentation and pride, (which I would not deſire to preſs into the ſervice of the ſanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry), would is not afford you a rational and pious pleaſure to reflect, that your fellow-chriſtians might ſay with regard to you, <q>Theſe are the perſons who are happily diſtinguiſhed from moſt of their companions, by obedience to God and gratitude to their Redeemer; they dare ſtand up for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his inſtitutions, and of his name, in the midſt of all the languor, and all the impiety of a degenerate age. Far from running with others to the ſame exceſs of riot<note n="(a)" place="bottom">1 Pet. iv. 4.</note>, they do not only ſecretly retire, that they may converſe with God, and devote themſelves to him, but they have the courage openly to appear in ſo good a cauſe.

readily expoſe themſelves to all the glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of a determinate adherence to him.

               <p>I SHALL only add, that theſe ſublime pleaſures are not limited to the happy moments which you ſpend in an immediate attendance on this feaſt of love; but they may be renewed, and perhaps ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, by reflection? whereas that often brings a ſting along with it, more than ſufficient to balance all the ſweetneſs to be found in irregular, ſenſual delights.</p>

It may probably be uſeful, both to yourſelves, and others I ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) It might be uſeful to yourſelves in a variety of reſpects.</p>
               <p>I CONSIDER, that I am now ſpeaking to them that look upon improvement in religion as their higheſt intereſt; and therefore ſhall only endeavour to ſhew you, what a tendency this ordinance has to aſſiſt you therein; and that is ſo evident, that I need not dwell largely on particulars, which, when ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a few words, may furniſh you with matter of ample meditation. I ſhall but mention then the following hints.</p>
               <p>THE preparatory exerciſes of devotion might be very awakening and edifying to you. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of your conduct, which you would be taking on the approach of theſe ſolemn ſeaſons; the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and praiſes you would then be addreſſing to God, and the meditations in which your minds would be employed, would rouſe you out of that lethargy into which you may be ready to ſink, and which the beſt of men find too frequently prevailing.</p>
               <p>THE views of a bleeding Redeemer, of a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled God, of a confirmed covenant, and of a world of approaching glory, which this ordinance ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally exhibit, would ſtrengthen, as well as delight, your ſouls; and, by virtue of the refreſhments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at theſe ſolemnities, you might be enabled to go on your way rejoicing, and to make a ſenſible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in your journey towards the heavenly Canaan.</p>
               <p>THE remembrance of thoſe ſolemn engagements, with which you would then be binding your ſouls unto the Lord, would be a ready anſwer in hours of future temptations. You would ſtart back with horror at the thought of alienating your ſervices from a God, to whom you had ſo ſeriouſly and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly

               <p>I SHALL only add here, that, by entering thus early into the communion of a church, you will be brought under the more immediate inſpection of the paſtor of it, and likewiſe of your chriſtian brethren; whoſe faithful and tender admonitions may be of great aſſiſtance to your unexperienced youth, and happily promote your progreſs, both in the paths of prudence, and of holineſs. Nay, the very thoughts of having drawn upon you the eyes of a ſociety, and of others too, would engage you to ſome more than ordinary care, that you might not incur their cenſure, or diſappoint the expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which many have raiſed of you. And, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of all this, I cannot but obſerve, that many of the moſt eminent chriſtians I have ever known, were found amongſt thoſe, who in their ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly days took this method of giving themſelves to God and his people.—I might farther ſhew you,</p>
               <p n="2">(2) THAT your compliance with the exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I am now enforcing, might be uſeful to others, as well as to yourſelves.</p>
               <p>THIS is indeed, in part of conſequence of the former; for, the more your own ſouls are advanced in knowledge and holineſs, the more capable, and the more ready will you be, to promote the intereſt of Chriſt in the world, and to do good to thoſe that are round about you. But I would eſpecially lead you to conſider, that your attendance itſelf, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from theſe remoter conſequences of it, might probably be uſeful to others.</p>

               <p>LET me then intreat and conjure you, by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriy of the King of glory and of grace, and by a regard to the honour, the pleaſure and the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, of your lives, that you no longer perſiſt in the neglect of an ordinance ſo ſacred and noble, ſo delightful and advantageous.</p>

I AM perſuaded, you muſt know and own, that the arguments I have urged are both evident and weighty; and yet I fear, you will find ſomething to oppoſe to them, which if it be not examined, may prevent or at leaſt diminiſh their ſucceſs. I proceed therefore,</p>

And if the enumeration be not ſo large, or the reply ſo full as you could wiſh, you know where you will be always welcome to propoſe your ſcruples as freely, and to ſtate them as amply, as you pleaſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. THE moſt obvious reply to the preceding ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs is, that <q>you fear you are not prepared for this ordinance, and therefore apprehend, that your attendance would prove dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, rather than beneficial.</q>
               </p>
               <p>TO this I anſwer; if the caſe be indeed thus, I have already told you, that you are not the perſons to whom I have been addreſſing. Nevertheleſs, give me leave to remind you, that you ought not raſhly to form ſuch a concluſion againſt yourſelves. I am ſure the matter requires a very attentive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination; and perhaps, on ſuch a review, you may find things are not ſo bad as you imagine.</p>
               <p>YOU ſay, you are not prepared: but I hope you know that there is a great deal of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the nature and importance of an actual and habitual preparation. It is plain, that actual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration conſiſt in thoſe extraordinary devotions, which, when opportunity permits, we ſhould uſe in

our approach to this ſacrament; and therefore ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes ſuch an approach to be determined, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently there can be no room, in the preſent caſe, to object the want of that.</p>
               <p>BUT you fear, that you are not habitually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, i. e. that you are not perſons of ſuch a temper and character as Chriſt, the great Lord of the feaſt, has invited, and will welcome to it. To determine that, conſider the purpoſes for which the ordinance was appointed, and obſerve how far your preſent temper correſponds to them. It was appointed to commemorate the death of Chriſt, and, in this view, all are fit for it, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard him as the great atoning ſacrifice, and deſire that their hearts may be affected, and their lives influenced, by a ſenſe of his dying love. It is a pledge of our mutual affection to each other, even to all our brethren in the Lord; and in this reſpect, all are prepared for it whoſe hearts are divested of all turbulent and unfriendly paſſions, and overflow with undiſſembled charity and diffuſive benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. True, will you perhaps ſay; but is it not alſo deſigned as a ſeal of the covenant of grace<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> It certainly is; and it muſt be a very criminal propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to attend it, while an alien from that cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: your determination therefore muſt turn on the anſwer which conſcience will make, as to your readineſs to enter yourſelves into it. For if this be your prevailing deſire, and ſtedfaſt reſolution, you have not only a right to the ordinance, though it b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a ſeal of the covenant; but its being appointed by Chriſt, in this view, is an additional and very weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty argument for your immediate and frequent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance upon it. And here the queſtion is in ſhort this; <q>do you ſincerely deſire to make an unreſerved ſurrender of yourſelves to God, as your owner, rul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

<pb n="113" facs="unknown:046736_0108_1021F25AF254DF58"/>
and the enlivening and ſanctifying influences of his ſpirit?</q> If this be your prevailing deſire, and ſincere purpoſe, you may aſſure yourſelves of the kindeſt welcome, though your graces may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a great deal of imperfection and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But if you are ſtrangers to ſuch a deſire, I muſt allow the objection in its full force, and own, that you have no buſineſs at the table of the Lord</p>
               <p>NEVERTHELESS I cannot part with you ſo. Oh my friends, is there nothing mournful, and, I will add, is there nothing dreadful, in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion as this? <q>I have no buſineſs at the table of the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have no part in this bleſſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt, becauſe I have no part in that Redeemer, whoſe death is commemorated there: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am ſhut out, by his own appointment ſhut out! and is not that a ſad intimation with reſpect to what is yet to come? When I enter on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible and eternal ſtate, as I this night may, will he admit me to live and reign with him in a world of glory, who would not allow me ſo much as an approach to his table on earth? Oh my ſoul, it is too plain, thou muſt be ſeparated from his bliſsful preſence, and driven to an eternal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, whence thou wilt behold with deſpairing eyes thoſe pious ſouls, who have eaten and drank with him here, ſitting down with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> then: oh that it might now be duly regarded!</p>
               <p>FROM all this it will appear, that if this objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from an unprepared temper be true, it ought not to be lightly paſſed over, but ſhould rather be ſeriouſly conſidered, and the removal of it, through divine aſſiſtance, immediately attempted; ſince, till you are prepared for this ſacrament, you cannot be prepared for heaven; and conſequently are in circumſtances of the extremeſt danger, and daily walk on the precipice of eternal ruin.</p>

                  <pb n="114" facs="unknown:046736_0109_1021F25CEC15D3E0"/>
BUT I would hope, many of you, on inquiry, find this is not your character and caſe. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitneſs you object will amount to no more than this; that you find grace weak and languid in your ſouls, though you have reaſon to hope you are not wholly deſtitute of it. And is this a juſt excuſe for absenting yourſelves from ſo confirming and edifying, as well as ſo delightful an ordinance? It is juſt as reaſonable, as if you were to plead, <q>I am very faint, and therefore I will not take the moſt noble, reviving cordial. I am very weak, and therefore I will refuſe the moſt nouriſhing and ſtrengthening food.</q> Thus much for the firſt objection. It is more than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>me that I proceed to thoſe that remain.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Now I muſt own, that if this objection be made by perſons who have been notorious on account of their immoralities, and who are but lately recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a ſenſe of divine things, it will not admit of an immediate anſwer; nor can I invite ſuch to this ſacred ordinance, till they give evidence of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a change in their heart, by an apparent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of life, and ſome ſteady and prevalent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution in a religious courſe: in the mean time, a regard to the ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

BUT as for ſuch young perſons, or others, who have been preſerved from ſuch irregularities, whoſe conduct has been fair and honourable, and who have not only arrived at a competent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the great truths of chriſtianity, but have for ſome time been impreſſed with them, ſo that they have formed a determinate reſolution for the ſervice of God, and, it may be, for ſome years made trial of his ways<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> far be it from us, my brethren, to ſay one word to diſcourage your approach.

No, my brethren, that hope, wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as it is, if you ſhall fall away, is unavoidably cut off from you; and all your ſchemes muſt be for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than certain ſalvation, and exalted glory.

It is moſt reaſonable to ſay, <q>Since there are ſo many profeſſors, that draw back even to perdition<note n="e" place="bottom">Heb. x. 39.</note>, I will wait upon the Lord,
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:046736_0114_1021F2A07692F668"/>
that I may renew my ſtrength<note n="a" place="bottom">Iſa. xl. 32.</note>, and ſo be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to endure to the end<note n="b" place="bottom">Matth. xxiv. 13.</note>, that I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the end of my faith in the ſalvation of my ſoul<note n="c" place="bottom">1 Pet. i. 9.</note>
                  </q> If your fears operate thus, they may be a means of preventing the evil, of which you are ſo apprehenſive.</p>
               <p>ON the whole, I hope, that when you weigh all I have been ſaying, and compare it with whatever can be objected againſt it, you will be convinced of your duty, and engaged to an immediate compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with it. I have enlarged ſo copiouſly on theſe things, that, in the laſt place.</p>
               <p>III. I CAN only mention two or three inferenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, which will naturally ariſe from what I have been laying before you.</p>
               <p>From hence we might infer, that great care ought to be taken to inſtruct youth in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of religion; that they may not be deſtitute of ſuch an acquaintance with them, as is one neceſſary part of preparation for this ordinance, though far from being alone ſufficient.</p>
               <p>WE may alſo infer, that more aged chriſtians ought carefully to cultivate ſerious impreſſions, which may be made on the minds of their children, ſervants, and others of the riſing generation, that they may be engaged to an early compliance with their duty; while, on the other hand, great care ought ſurely to be taken, that there be nothing ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous and ſevere in the terms of admiſſion, which may bear hard upon that modeſty and tenderneſs of ſpirit, which is generally to be found in young chriſtians, and moſt eminently in thoſe of the moſt hopeful and amiable characters.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="unknown:046736_0115_1021F2A203D0A388"/>
As for thoſe of a more advanced age, who have lived in the neglect of this great and excellent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, I hope they have long before this infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the guilt and folly of their omiſſion, which ſo evidently appears from all I have been ſaying, and it is attended with many other aggravations, which my time will not now permit me to mention.</p>
               <p>I SHALL therefore conclude with obſerving, that thoſe young perſons, who, through grace, have been convinced of their duty in this inſtance, and brought to an early compliance with it, have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant reaſon to reflect upon it with pleaſure and thankfulneſs. I think it is one of the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant bleſſings of my life, that there are many ſuch in the church here; many who, through the divine goodneſs, have lately been added to it. It would not be eaſy for me, my dear brethren and friends, to ſay how great pleaſure your preſence and ſociety adds to my ſacrament-days; or what a delightful proſpect it gives me, not only as to the comfort of my own more advanced age, but as to the ſupport of religion here, when I am no longer amongſt you. I, and our more aged friends, have reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice on this occaſion; but ſurely you yourſelves have much greater reaſon. Permit me to remind you, that it will be a moſt proper expreſſion of your thankfulneſs, to labour with the utmoſt care to engage other young perſons, your brethren and companions, to come and ſhare with you in this feaſt. I hope, your own experience of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and advantage which attends it, may be add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the other arguments I have been pleading. As for your own conduct, let me moſt affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately intreat, and moſt ſolemnly charge you, not only by all other arguments, but by your ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal vows; by the eyes of God, and of man, that are upon you; by all our expectations from you, and all your engagements to us; that as you have

received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, ſo you would walk in him<note n="a" place="bottom">Col. ii. 6.</note>. And may almighty grace ſtrengthen and quicken you in your progreſs; and crown that fair morning, which is opening upon us in ſo hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, in ſo delightful a manner, with a long, a bright, and a proſperous day!

               <p>THERE are few precepts of the goſpel, which will appear more eaſy to a humane and a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous mind, than that, in which we are required to weep with them that weep<note n="a" place="bottom">Rom. xii 15.</note>.

which, if alone, had been very grievous, and when added to ſuch a weight of former ſorrows, is I fear, almoſt inſupportable.</p>
               <p>I BELIEVE all of you, who are acquainted with the caſe ſincerely pity them, and wiſh their relief; but I am under ſome peculiar obligations to deſire and attempt it; not only on account of my public character, but as I know the heart of an orphan, having myſelf been deprived of both my parents, at an age, in which it might reaſonably be ſuppoſed a child ſhould be moſt ſenſible of ſuch a loſs. I cannot recollect any ſcripture, which was then more comfortable, as I think none could have been more ſuitable to me, than this which is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us; and I the rather chuſe to inſiſt upon it, as it will naturally lead me into ſome reflections, which I hope, by the divine bleſſing, may be of general uſe. "When my father and my mother forſake me, then the Lord will take me up."</p>
               <p>As for the Pſalm from whence theſe words are taken, we are told in the title, that it was compoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by David, but are left to conjecture to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular occaſion of it. Dr. Patrick refers it to the latter end of his time, and to the combat that he had with the Philiſtines in his declining age; when we are told, that David waxed faint, and was in great danger of being killed by a giant, if Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal, the brother of Joab, had not ſeaſonably reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued him; upon which it is added, that his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſware, He ſhould no more go out to battle, leſt he ſhould quench the light of Iſrael<note n="a" place="bottom">2 Sam. xxi. 15, 17.</note>. To theſe words David is ſupppoſed to allude, when he ſays, The Lord is my light, and my ſalvation, whom ſhall I fear?—Mine enemies come upon me to eat up my fleſh;—and I had fainted, unleſs I had believed<note n="b" place="bottom">Pſal. xxvii. 1, 2, 13.</note>. But I am rather inclined to
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:046736_0119_1021F2AADD21F260"/>
conjecture, that this Pſalm was compoſed by him in his younger years, when he was under perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Saul. There is not a line in it, which doth not agree with this ſuppoſition; and there are ſeveral verſes, which cannot ſo well be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to the other; eſpecially the 12th, in which he repreſents his dangers as ariſing from falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. Now it is not eaſy to imagine, what miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheif they could have done him amongſt the Philiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines who oppoſed him in a national, rather than a perſonal quarrel; but he expreſsly declares elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, that the lying words of ſome treacherous perſons had exaſperated Saul againſt him<note n="a" place="bottom">1 Sam, xxiv. 9.</note>; and complains of falſe tongues, in thoſe Pſalms, which are, by their title, fixed to this period of his hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<note n="b" place="bottom">Pſal. lii. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>x. 12.</note>. I might add, that the words of the text ſeem to favour this ſuppoſition; for David doth not here ſay, that his father and mother had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy forſaken him, but only ſpeaks of it as what might happen. Now, as we are elſewhere told, that when David was but a lad, his father was an old man<note n="c" place="bottom">1 Sam. xvii. 12.</note>, it is very improbable, that both Jeſſe and his wife ſhould have been living at the time of this Philiſtine war, when David himſelf was grown old and feeble.</p>
               <p>IF this argument be of weight to ſix the general occaſion of the Pſalm, it is proable that this verſe may lead us to the particular time of its compoſure We are told, that when David had taken ſhelter at Adullam, from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

the prieſts of the Lord. Perhaps this was the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reflection of David, about the time his parents were to remove: When my father and mother for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake me, then the Lord will take me up. As if he ſhould have ſaid, <q>Though an hoſt of my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies be encamping againſt me, and the nation be riſing in arms to oppoſe me; and though I be forced to diſmiſs my aged parents, at a time when I have the greateſt occaſion for their pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent advice, and their tender conſolations; yet this my comfort, that God is with me.

               <p>BUT the ſevereſt trial is, when God ſees fit to remove them by death. When that awful meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger gives the ſummons, we muſt part, though ever ſo deſirous of continuing together. None can by any means deliver his brother from going down to the grave, nor give to God a ranſom for him<note n="b" place="bottom">Pſal. xlix. 7, 8.</note>, though he ſhould offer his own life under that view. Our fathers, where are they<note n="c" place="bottom">Zech. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="129" facs="unknown:046736_0124_1021F2B582BC2648"/>
by death! Perhaps, more than are left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. We have followed them to the grave, we have left them in the duſt, and their places that knew them, know them no more<note n="a" place="bottom">Job vii. 10.</note>. And if we are not quickly taken ourſelves, we muſt expect, that our breaches will ſoon be multiplied upon us; and that nothing will remain of thoſe dear crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whom we now behold with tenderneſs, and with tranſport, but a mournful remembrance that we once enjoyed them, and a deſpair of recovering them again, till we meet in the eternal world.</p>
               <p>I WILL only add one very obvious reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this head, and then proceed to the next.</p>
               <p>MAY the deareſt of our friends ſo ſoon forſake us? Then how careful ſhould we be, that we do not value them too highly, and love them too fondly?</p>
               <p>WE find in ſcripture, that the inconſtancy, and the mortality of human nature, are each of them urged as an argument againſt truſting in man. Thus we are cautioned to take heed every one of his neighbour, and truſt not in any brother; for every brother will utterly ſupplant, and every neighbour will walk with ſlanders<note n="b" place="bottom">Jer. ix. 4.</note>. And elſewhere we are bid to ceaſe from man, whoſe breath is in his noſtrils; for wherein is he to be accounted of<note n="c" place="bottom">Iſa. ii. 22.</note>? And how indeed can we reckon on any thing as certain, which is ſuſpended on ſo uncertain a life? The words of Solomon are applicable to friends, as well as to riches, when he ſays, Wilt thou ſet thine eyes upon that which is not? for they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wings, and flee away; often ſwiftly and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably, as an eagle towards heaven<note n="d" place="bottom">Prov. xxiii. 5.</note>.

               <p>WHEN our friends are dead, we are generally more ſenſible of their value than we were before: but let the tendereſt heart, under the immediate impreſſion of this ſevere calamity, ſet itſelf to paint the character of a departed friend in all its moſt amiable colours; let it reckon up all the advantag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, which fondneſs could have taught it to hope for; and I will anſwer for it, that all this, and a great deal more, is to be found in God. Let the dejected orphan, that is even now weeping over the duſt of a parent, yea, of both its parents, ſay, what theſe parents, in the greateſt ſuppoſable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of character and circumſtance, could have done for its ſupport, and its conſolation; and the complaints of the moſt pathetic ſorrow ſhall ſuggest thoughts which may ſerve, in a great meaſure, to anſwer themſelves, and to engage the mind joyfully to acquieſce in the divine care, though deſerted by the beſt of parents, or any other friends, however hopeful or uſeful.</p>
               <p>"ALAS," will a dutiful and affectionate child be ready to ſay, in ſuch a circumſtance, <q>do you aſk what my parents were? They were my dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, my kindeſt, my moſt valuable friends:—Their counſels guided me;—their care protected me; their daily converſe was the joy of my life;—their tender condolence revived me under my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows;—their liberal bounty ſupplied my neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Is it to be inquired, what they were? Say rather, what were they not? And now they are gone, where muſt I ſeek such friends? And how juſtly may I ſay, that my deareſt comforts
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:046736_0127_1021F2BAED8DBA58"/>
and hopes lie buried with their precious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains?</q>
               </p>
               <p>LET us more particularly ſurvey each of theſe thoughts, and conſider, with how much greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage each of theſe particulars is to be found in the paternal care and favour of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. COULD your parents have adviſed you in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and perplexities? God is much more able to do it.</p>
               <p>YOU will perhaps ſay, <q>Our poor giddy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practiſed minds have been hurried with a variety of ſchemes and projects, and we have ſoon found ourſelves bewildered and loſt: but then it has been the greateſt pleaſure to us to apply to our parents, from whoſe more advanced age, and rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er experience, we might well hope for conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble aſſiſtance. We were ſure they would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> upbraid our ignorance, or deſpiſe us for our weakneſs; but would give us their beſt advice, with endearing tenderneſs, and a cordial concern for our welfare.</q> I allow, my friends, that if they were wiſe and good, (which we now ſuppoſe,) they were valuable counſellors indeed; and that it was your duty, and your happineſs, to uſe them as ſuch while living, and to uſe them as ſuch now they are no more. Yet were they ever ſo prudent, you muſt ſtill acknowledge they were fallible creatures. They could only form probable conjectures concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the future conſequences of things; and as thoſe conjectures were always precarious, ſo, no doubt, they were ſometimes erroneous; and you were, perhaps, in ſome inſtances, miſled by their miſtaken apprehenſions. But the only wiſe God knows the end from the beginning; his views of the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant futurities are not conjectural, but certain; and his wiſdom is far more ſuperior to that of the moſt
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:046736_0128_1021F2BDAFCA8EE0"/>
ſagacious and experienced mortal, than the wiſdom of ſuch a mortal can be ſuperior to that of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant. It is he that teaches man knowledge<note n="a" place="bottom">Pſal. xciv. 10.</note>, in whatever degree he poſſeſſes it. He inſtructed our parents, that they might inſtruct us; and he has expreſsly promiſed his direction to all thoſe that humbly ſeek it. The meek will he guide in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the meek will he teach his way<note n="b" place="bottom">Pſal. xxv. 9.</note>. You may therefore, according to his own inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and command, cry unto him, My father, thou art the guide of my youth<note n="c" place="bottom">Jer. iii. 4.</note>; and you will find him ſuch a guide, as can give wiſdom to the ſimple, and to the young man knowledge and diſcretion.<note n="d" place="bottom">Prov. i. 4.</note>.</p>
               <p n="2">2. COULD your earthly parents have protected you from injuries? God is much more able to do it.</p>
               <p>NATURE has implanted even in irrational animals, ſuch a regard to the ſafety of their offspring, that many of the moſt weak and timorous of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſtrangely couragious in their defence. The little bird, that will at other times ſly from every noiſe and every motion, will hover over her young, when they are aſſaulted with danger; and, rather than ſhe will forſake them, will ſhare in their ruin. It is eaſy to perceive the ſpirit of parents, natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly riſe on the leaſt injury that is offered to their children, even ſometimes when it is only accidental, and undeſigned; and all the profeſſed enemies of their children, they of courſe reckon to be their own. Nor do they only watch over them in their infancy and childhood, to defend them from the many dangers which ſurround thoſe tender days;
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:046736_0129_1021F2BF343C0A30"/>
but in more advanced years, they are ready to uſe all their power and their influence, to ſhelter them from the unworthy uſage which they might otherwiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from an ill natured world: and I own, it is a very melancholy thing for young people to loſe ſuch, a guard, at a time when they are moſt expoſed.</p>
               <p>BUT ſurely the defence of the Almighty muſt be a much juſter and nobler confidence. It is amazing to obſerve, in how condeſcending a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he expreſſes his care for the protection of his people. In one place, he ſays, He that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of his eye<note n="a" place="bottom">Zech. ii. 8.</note>; and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, He ſhall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings ſhalt thou truſt<note n="b" place="bottom">Pſal. xci. 4.</note>; i. e. he ſhall defend thee, as the bird ſhelters her little helpleſs brood, from the aſſault of any thing that would injure or deſtroy them. And could we deſire a better guard? There are many ſeaſons, when our earthly parents muſt of neceſſity be ſeparated from us; and a thouſand calamities might overtake and deſtroy us, even in their preſence, while they ſtood by helpleſs and amazed: but God is always with his children, and as there is no danger of ours un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen by him, there can be none, from which he is not able to deliver us. When David was forſaken by his father and mother, and ſurrounded with a whole army of inhuman enemies, he ſpeaks of this as his comfort, The Lord is my light, and my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: whom ſhall I fear? The Lord is the ſtrength of my life: of whom ſhall I be afraid? Though an hoſt ſhould encamp againſt me, my heart ſhall not fear; though war ſhould riſe againſt me, in this will I be confident<note n="c" place="bottom">Pſal. xxvii. i. 3.</note>: for in his help I ſhall be ſafe, though I ſtood ſingle againſt united legions.</p>

3. DID you hope for agreeable entertainment in the company of our earthly parents? You may expect far nobler pleaſure in converſing with God.</p>
               <p>I ACKNOWLEDGE there is ſomething peculiarly delightful in the company of a wiſe, a pious, and an indulgent parent; and I doubt not, but many of us can eaſily recollect it. Even in our infant-days, when we were fondly prattling to them, we, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, often ſaw ſmiles of complacency <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

And as he grew up to a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iper underſtanding, we were ſtill more charmed with the company of ſuch parents. We had not only the manly pleaſure of rational converſe, but there was a mixture of reverence and of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in our hearts, which much increaſed the delight. We were aſſured of their candour towards their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and their prejudice in favour of what we might ſay; and that inſpired us with ſpirit and cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. We were encouraged to attempt to pleaſe them, becauſe we concluded we might eaſily do it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the ſenſe we had of the ſuperiority on their parts, made every expreſſion of their kindneſs ſo much the more ſweet and obliging.</p>
               <p>THE loſs of ſuch converſation is indeed to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>EARTHLY parents may ſometimes be ſo indigent that they cannot, and ſometimes ſo unkind that they will not, relieve their children, at leaſt in ſuch a proportion as their neceſſities require. But the moſt high God is the poſſeſſor of heaven and earth<note n="b" place="bottom">Gen. xiv. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

There is not one parent in ten thouſand ſo unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as that he could ſtand by, and ſee his child pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh for hunger, while it was in the power of his hand to relieve him. Now our Lord has taught us to argue thus, if ye, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more ſhall your heavenly father give good things unto them that aſk him<note n="d" place="bottom">Mat. vii. 11.</note>?</p>
               <p>God has the eſtates, and the hearts of all in his hands; and therefore can, with the utmoſt eaſe, raiſe up friends to us in the moſt abandoned cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, who ſhall act the part of parents to us, and do more for us than they could have done. And it is farther to be remembered, that the bounties of God are far more excellent, than thoſe of any mortal friend could poſſibly be. Their bounty, be it ever ſo great, cannot reach beyond the grave; but it is our father's good pleaſure to give us a kingdom<note n="e" place="bottom">Luke xii. 32.</note>, incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

circumſtances that can be conſiſtent with ſuch a hope.</p>
               <p>You ſee then, on the whole, how much more the good man may find in God, than he can poſſibly loſe in the moſt valuable earthly parents.</p>
               <p>IT only remains that I conclude the diſcourſe with a few reflections of this ſecond obſervation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. LET us thankfully acknowledge the gracious proviſion which God has made to ſupport his people under the loſs of parents and friends.</p>
               <p>WE ſhould bleſs his name, that he does not leave us to ſink under the burden; or at beſt to collect ſome uncertain comfort from the precarious conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of our unaſſiſted reaſon; but that, through the blood and righteouſneſs of his ſon, he has giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en his plain and expreſs promiſe for the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of ſuch inconſiderable and undeſerving creatures.</p>
               <p>YOU, whoſe parents are living, ought to be thankful, that God hath provided ſuch reviving cordials for you againſt the mournful time when they may be taken away.</p>
               <p>AND we, who have loſt our parents, and have found relief in our extremities, from ſuch decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations as theſe, ſhould recollect it with pleaſure, and often repeat our ſongs of grateful acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>AND I will farther add, we ought not only to rejoice and to be thankful on our own account, but alſo on account of thoſe afflicted friends who may receive ſupport from ſuch ſtrong conſolations. We pity children that have loſt their parents, and it is delightful to ſee other generous perſons riſing up to take care of the orphans, and in ſome reſpect to make up their loſs. But how much more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:046736_0135_1021F2CB73F8EA98"/>
it ſhould be to us, to hear an Almighty God proclaiming himſelf as their great guardian, and ſaying, that when their father and their mother for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them, he will graciouſly take them up. How ſhould we rejoice, that when we ſet ourſelves to comfort and encourage them, we cannot only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance our own conjuctures, but can thus ſpeak to them in the language of God himſelf. And indeed this reflection may be applied to all the other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. We ought to rejoice, that our pious friends have an intereſt in them, and that God hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted their ſupport and conſolation, as well as our own.</p>
               <p>And ſurely, when we are reflecting upon ſuch a promiſe as this, our affectionate thoughts and praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es ſhould ariſe to him, in whom all the promiſes of God are Yea and Amen<note n="a" place="bottom">2 Cor. i 20.</note>. It is natural to ſay <q>whence is it that thou, the holy majeſty of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, wilt appear under ſuch endearing and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der characters to ſinful mortals! that thou wilt ſpeak of taking them up! of beſtowing one gracious look upon them, and much more of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending an arm of mercy to raiſe them from that helpleſs condition, in which they naturally lie, like abandoned outcaſts! Whence is it that thou wilt take them into thy family now, and into thy kingdom at laſt?</q> (for all this is intimated in this expreſſion). "Lord," may each of us ſay, <q>I humbly aſcribe it to the riches of thy goſpel grace. I would declare it to the everlaſting ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Jeſus thy ſon, that it is through him we have received the adoption.</q>

You are then deprived of their prayers, their exhortations, their advices, and their examples; and to ſeem to be thrown farther out of the way of repentance and reformation. And let me add, that if almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty grace doth not prevent it, the trouble which you now feel, in being ſeparated from ſuch dear rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions while you continue on earth, will be the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt part of your unhappineſs; for you muſt final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſeparated, not only from all the moſt valuable perſons you have ever known here, but, which is infinitely more, from the preſence of the bleſſed God himſelf; muſt fall unpitied victims of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine juſtice, and be delivered over to dwell with your father the devil whoſe works you have choſen to do<note n="b" place="bottom">John viii. 44.</note>. And oh! how unutterably dreadful is it to think, that in the awful day, when this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is to be pronounced and executed upon you, there will not be one friend to plead in your favour! That though your pious parents be then preſent, yet, in a moſt terrible ſenſe, father and mother will then forſake you indeed; and, inſtead of interpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:046736_0137_1021F2CFDEAE9D40"/>
their intreaties for you, will applaud the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous vengeance that dooms you as obſtinate rebels to eternal death; to thoſe abodes of diſtinguiſhed miſery which are prepared for ſuch as have broke through all the peculiar advantages which will then be found chargeable to your account.</p>
               <p n="3">3. LET what I have been ſaying be conſidered by parents, as an encouragement cheerfully to leave their religious children in the hands of God, when providence ſhall ſee fit to make the ſeparation.</p>
               <p>WHEN, through the riches of goſpel-grace, a chriſtian parent ſees his own eternal concerns ſo ſafe in a Redeemer's hands, that he can ſay, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to them, I deſire to depart<note n="a" place="bottom">Phil. i. 23.</note>; yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he feels reluctance mingling itſelf with the holy deſire, when he conſiders that he muſt leave his dear children behind him; perhaps in a deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, and always, if they be very young, in a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous condition. And this thought preſſes with peculiar weight on the minds of thoſe who have loſt the companions of their lives; as, upon their deceaſe, their children will become entirely orphans. But may it not revive you, to hear, that God will be their guardian, if they be willing to chuſe him as ſuch? Surely you may be abundantly ſatisfied with his care. Alas! what were you yourſelves, with all your parental tenderneſs, but inſtruments which God made uſe of for conveying ſome few of his favours to them? And cannot he do that by others which he hath long been doing by you? Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt not his power or his faithfulneſs; but turn all your anxious care about future events, into a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous concern to do your duty to your children, and,

by all the moſt prudent and affectionate methods of addreſs, to lead them into the early knowledge of God in Chriſt; that ſo, through the mercies of an everlaſting covenant, they may ſtand intitled to the ſpecial protection of an heavenly father, who can never be ſeparated from them; and who, as he is never unable, will never prove unwilling to help them. Once more;</p>
               <p n="4">4. LET diſtreſſed orphans have an immediate and frequent recourſe to ſuch ſupporting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations as theſe;—</p>

He ſupplied the breaches that he had made, and by a train of providence, which we cannot but admire in the review, raiſed up other friends for us; and, it may be, inſpired al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt with the tenderneſs of parents, perſons, who were ever unknown to us, when the laſt of our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents was taken away.

               <p>THE words of the text are the pathetic lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of good old David, on the death of Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom; a favourite, but wicked ſon. His pious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had no doubt given him a religious education; and it is very probable, that, conſidering the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable beauty and gracefulneſs of his perſon, he was ready to hope, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

virtuous and holy diſpoſitions of ſoul, the correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponding beauties of the mind. But theſe hopes were dreadfully diſappointed; for the darling, the beautiful Abſalom, proved a murderer and a rebel; he went in unto his father's concubines, in the ſight of all Iſrael<note n="a" place="bottom">2 Sam. xvi. 22.</note>, and openly attempted to take away the life of him, from whom his own was derived, and by whoſe indulgence it had been ſpared, even when forfeited to juſtice. Yet nevertheleſs David had ſuch paternal tenderneſs, as, under all theſe cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing provocations, expreſsly to order the generals of his army, to deal gently with the young man Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom, for his ſake<note n="b" place="bottom">2 Sam xviii. 5.</note>. But the righteous venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God determined it otherwiſe, and, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all his father's fond precautions, brought him down to the grave with infamy and blood. He was ſnatched away by a violent and very terrible death, in the prime of his days, and the very act of his ſin; and this was the occaſion of thoſe mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, O my ſon, Abſalom, my ſon, my ſon, Abſalom! Would God I had died for thee, O Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalom, my ſon, my ſon!</p>
               <p>WE may charitably, and I think very reaſonably ſuppoſe, that they are not only the expreſſions of David's natural affection, on the death of a ſon whom he tenderly loved; but that they aroſe from the views of that ſtate on which he entered by death, which muſt certainly be very dreadful; ſo dreadful, that David, whoſe eternal intereſts were secure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <p>I CANNOT pretend to enumerate them all, or to deſcribe them in ſuch pathetick language as a bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart will ſpeak itſelf on ſo bad an occaſion; but probably the chief of them may be ſuch as theſe;</p>

               <p>PARENTS are apt to flatter themſelves with fond hopes from their infant-offspring; they look upon them as the bloſſoms of future delight and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. They comfort themſelves under the other burdens of life, and the additional cares and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours which a growing family brings upon them, by looking forward to future years, and anticipat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pleaſures hereafter to ariſe from the duty, gratitude, and uſefulneſs of their children. <q>But alas! will the good may ſay, Could I have ſeen what this poor creature would have proved inſtead of rejoicing in his birth, I ſhould have mourned over it as a calamity to me and my fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

But when I looked that this pleaſant plant ſhould have brought forth grapes, behold it brought forth wild grapes<note n="a" place="bottom">Iſa. v. 4.</note>.

And with relation to this unhappy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I was not entirely wanting in ſuch endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours as lay in my power. What knowledge in the things of God I myſelf had, I was willing
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:046736_0147_1021F4EEC35DB1C0"/>
to communicate to him: I urged them ſeriouſly upon him; I frequently reminded him of them; and, to ſupply the defects of my perſonal inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I put the book of God into his hands, and engaged him in an early and conſtant attendance on public ordinances. When I ſaw him wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the paths of folly and ſin, I endeavoured to convince him of the fatal conſequences of ſuch courſes, and in the moſt affectionate manner to diſſuade him from them. I have again and again urged him to pray for himſelf; and I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently been praying for him. I have deſired that he might be remembered in our worſhipping aſſemblies; I have borne him on my heart before God in the family and the cloſet, and God alone knows with what overflowing tenderneſs. How importunately have I pleaded, and how unwilling have I been to take any denial! But alas! all my prayers and my tears have been like water on the ground; and in all the endeavours I have been uſing for his converſion and ſalvation, I have been labouring in vain, and ſpending my time and my ſtrength for nought<note n="a" place="bottom">Iſa. xlix. 4.</note>. Nay, as to him it has proved worſe than in vain; for every inſtruction, and every correction, every reproof, and every prayer, has aggravated his guilt, and increaſed his miſery; ſo that on the whole, while I thought I was acting the kindeſt and moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate part, I was only treaſuring up for my child aggravated wrath and damnation.</q> But this leads me to add,</p>

"Oh!" will the afflicted chriſtian ſay, <q>how comparatively light would my ſorrows be, if, while I am looking on the breathleſs corps, and mourning the diſappointment of my hopes as to the preſent life, I could by faith look forward to a world of glory, and ſee the branch of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily which is cut off from earth, tranſplanted thither, and flouriſhing there: joy would then mingle itſelf with my parental ſorrows, and praiſes with my tears. But alas! I have reaſon to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, it was cut down, that it might be caſt into the burnings. On the former ſuppoſition I might have comforted myſelf with the thought of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my child again, of meeting him on terms of infinite advantage, no more to be ſeparated from him. But now alas! I have not only loſt my child for a while, but I have loſt him for ever; for the unhappy creature died a ſtranger to God and Chriſt, and therefore what can I imagine, but that he is fallen into the hands of divine ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance? Overwhelming thought! while he lived, my bowels yearned for him when he was under any affliction; when I ſaw him ſtruggling with illneſs and pain, I pitied him, and I wept over him. Oh, how can I bear to think, that he is now tormented in that flame<note n="a" place="bottom">Luke xvi. 24.</note>, and that God is pouring forth on him the vials of his wrath! Oh! that the blood of the parent could redeem the ſoul of the child, how willingly, how gladly, would I part with it!—O my ſon Abſalom, my ſon, my ſon Abſalom!

               <p>"IT would be mournful," may the good man <q>ſay, to think that I ſhould ſee him no more; yet, as the matter now ſtands, even that would be ſome alleviation of my diſtreſs: but the immutable decrees of God forbid it.

And when he comes to make the enquiry, what will the iſſue be? Will my ſon accuſe me? Or muſt I be a witneſs againſt him? How terrible an office! to bear my teſtimony for the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of one whom I tenderly loved, of one, whoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

I know I ſhall not dare to interpoſe in his favour, and plead the cauſe of my Saviour's enemy; or, if I were ſo far tranſported by the fondneſs of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I ſhould plead in vain. Sooner, much ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, would the mountains be removed for me, or the earth carried out of its place<note n="b" place="bottom">Job xviii. 4.</note>, than the ſentence of Heaven, its final ſolemn ſentence would be repealed. And if it muſt not be repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how ſhall I bear to hear it pronounced, to ſee it executed: to hear my own child ſeparated by an everlaſting curſe from the preſence of the Lord; to ſee the miniſters of divine wrath, hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying away the helpleſs creature, and dragging him down to unquenchable burnings? Oh that, if no ſhelter muſt be allowed him, God would hide me in the grave till this tremendous ſcene of

his indignation be overpaſt; left the anguiſh of a parent mingle itſelf with the joys of a riſing ſaint, and, to me, overcaſt the triumphs of the day!</q> Hardly can a good man refrain from ſuch ſentiments as theſe, though ſome of them be dictat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by paſſion, rather than by reaſon.</p>
               <p>AFTER this ſurvey of the reflections, which such a ſad event might naturally produce, I would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to draw ſome inferences from it; yet I cannot but delay them for a few moments, in compaſſion to the ſorrows of those pious parents, if any ſuch be amongſt us, whoſe caſe this has been. Are there any of you, chriſtians, that experimentally know the anguiſh of ſuch thoughts as theſe? Any of you, that have thus been mourning over your dead children, when God has on a ſudden called them to his bar, with all their follies and ſins on their head, without giving you any probable hope, that his grace had firſt recalled them to himſelf, and waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their ſouls in the blood of a Redeemer?</p>
               <p>It grieves me, my friends, to have been forced by a ſenſe of duty, as I have now been, ſo largely to repreſent a ſcene which muſt call up your ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows afreſh. But permit me to remind you, that, even in this dreadful circumſtance, the conſolations of God are not ſmall<note n="a" place="bottom">Job xv. 11.</note>. Your hopes in your children have been ſadly blaſted; but you have hopes in God, your heavenly father which nothing can ſhake. You have reaſon to fear, their ſouls are loſt; but it is nothing to you to reflect, that your own are given you as a prey? And that though your houſe be not ſo with God, as in this reſpect you could moſt affectionately with it, yet he has made with you an everlaſting covenant, ordered in all things and ſure<note n="b" place="bottom">2 Sam. xxiii. 5.</note>.

And, as to the final interview, which appears ſo griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the proſpect, remember, that you are not to carry along with you the fond inſtincts of nature into a world of perfection and glory. All your paſſions will then be refined; your will ſo entirely reſolved into the will of God, and your ſouls ſo completely ſatisfied with his preſence and his love, that no creature regards will be able to diſturb their ſacred ſerenity. You will look on the whole aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the enemies of God with ſo deep an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the malignity of their character, and of the wiſdom and equity of that divine ſentence by which they fall, that you will not diſtinguiſh any of them from the reſt, by the ſentiments of a painful compaſſion. Nor will your concern for thoſe of them, who now lie neareſt to your heart, prevent your concurrence in that ſong of triumph, ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the ſolemnities of that awful day: Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; juſt and true are thy ways, thou king of ſaints<note n="c" place="bottom">Rev. xv. 3.</note>.

II. I PROCEED to draw ſome inferences from the ſad ſurvey we have been taking, of the pious pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent's reflections on the death of a wicked child. And hence we may infer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. THAT wicked children are acting a very cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el and unnatural part, while they are expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their pious parents to ſuch reflections as theſe.</p>
               <p>I SAY it with a ſorrowful heart, but ſo it is, that I fear there are ſeveral of you, my young friends, who live in the neglect of your own ſouls, and whoſe conſciences will preſently charge it upon you. How ſoon that awful being, whom you now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, may cut off the number of your months in the midſt<note n="a" place="bottom">Job xxi. 21.</note>, and add you to the number of the dead, you know not; but this is certain, that if you die as you live, and your parents ſurvive the ſtroke, they will feel the weight of theſe terrible reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and even now they cannot but fear them. Doubtleſs, if they be preſent here their hearts are bleeding whilſt I ſpeak, and they are looking upon you with unknown anguiſh. And does not the thought grieve you, and does it not ſhame you? Ungrateful creatures! are theſe your returns for all their bounty for all their tenderneſs; to be a ſword in their bowels, and to pierce their very hearts? Alas, they did not expect ſuch ſcenes as theſe, when you hung about them with your infant arms; when you anſwered their fond ſmiles, and liſped out the firſt broken accents of endearment. I wonder how you can bear the thought! I wonder you are not aſhamed to be converſing with them daily, and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiving new favours from them; while you are behaving in ſuch a manner, that, the better they
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:046736_0153_1021F4FB01D4FE80"/>
love you, the more they muſt be afflicted and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for you. Oh, that you would have compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on them! or, if this will not move you, oh that you would have compaſſion on yourſelves! for your own intereſt is ſtill much more nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned than theirs. Which leads me to add,</p>
               <p n="2">2. WE <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> farther infer, that a dreadful coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpart to thoſe reflections will be the portion of the ungodly child.</p>
               <p>ALAS, ſinners, if your pious parents weep thus for you, how bitterly will you weep for yourſelves! for if theſe things be done in a green tree, what will be done in the dry<note n="a" place="bottom">Luke xxiii. 28, 31.</note>! if they, the children of God, perhaps even then under the ſmiles of their heavenly father, and in the near views of their own complete ſalvation, may utter their griefs in ſuch melting accents, what agonies will take hold of your hearts, when you are actually entered on thoſe ſeats of horror and deſpair, to which the righteous vengeance of God has doomed you? It is impoſſible fully to deſcribe them; yet ſomething relating to them we may certainly infer from what has been already ſaid. Give me leave to offer it to your view, if peradventure, through the agency of divine grace, to have heard of theſe reflections may be the happy means of leading you to eſcape them.</p>
               <p>YOUR parents may reflect <q>on the diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their expectations from you:</q> But oh, how heavy will the diſappointment of your own hopes and expectations then ſit upon your ſouls! how will you then bear it, ſinners, when you ſee all
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:046736_0154_1021F4FCEF7F4958"/>
your enjoyments, and all your proſpects blaſted in a moment, and irrecoverably loſt?</p>
               <p>IT is true, you are lifting up your ſouls unto vanity<note n="a" place="bottom">Iſa. xxiv. 4.</note>; but theſe vanities are your all. You purſue them with the utmoſt vigour and intenſeneſs of mind, and have a great many fond and chimeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſchemes for years of pleaſure and happineſs yet to come. But if God cut you off in the prime of your life, and in the very flower of your hopes, in that day all your thoughts will periſh<note n="b" place="bottom">Pſal. cxlvi. 4.</note>. And how will you be confounded to ſee all the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and enchanted ſcenes that now charm you to the neglect of God and religion, vaniſh like the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowy glories of a dream, and your ſouls left nak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and deſtitute upon an inhoſpitable ſhore, where, in all your indigence and diſtreſs, there will be no eye to pity you, no hand to relieve you!</p>
               <p>AND it will be ſo much the more dreadful, as you will go down to theſe melancholy regions with your appetites and your paſſions warm about you, and by frequent indulgence ſtrengthened and inflamed; ſo that, for want of their proper objects, they will prey upon your heart, and an inſatiable thirſt will continue, while you will not have one drop of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfaction or comfort. Nay, I may add, that as, in theſe unripened days, you have had little experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the vanities and diſappointments of life, and have entertained a great many fond and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant hopes of what you would never have found in it, your regret, in being cut off from them, will not be in proportion to what they really were, but to what your error and folly imagined them to have been.</p>
               <p>YOUR pious parents will reflect upon it with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable anguiſh! <q>that your ſouls are for ever
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:046736_0155_1021F4FE774A4430"/>
loſt:</q> But how much more ſenſibly will you yourſelves feel it! They, in their preſent ſituation on earth can have but a little faint and imperfect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the horrors of the infernal priſon; for to thoſe we may accommodate the language of the apoſtle on a very different occaſion, and ſay, that neither has eye ſeen them, nor ear heard them, nor has it entered into the moſt terrified heart fully to conceive them<note n="a" place="bottom">1 Cor. ii. 9.</note>. But how will the change af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect you, when you are juſt entered on thoſe realms of woe! when you look round about you, and think, this is my laſt abode, my only remaining in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance? Alas, how will your hearts be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed, when you compare that place of torment with all the cheerful ſcenes of the world from whence you came; where you had been ſurrounded with ſo many delights; where it had been your chief care to make proviſion for the fleſh<note n="b" place="bottom">Rom. xiii. 14.</note>; and where you had, perhaps, ſpent your days in mirth, till in a moment you went down to the grave<note n="c" place="bottom">Job xxi. 13.</note>! when, inſtead of the light of the ſun, you ſee nothing but the flames of the divine indignation; when, inſtead of all that ſoothed and regaled your ſenſes, you feel the never dying worm, and exchange the gay and agreeable companions that did ſurround you, for the ſociety of devils and damned ſpirits!</p>
               <p>I APPEAL to your conſciences; can your hearts endure, or your hands be ſtrong<note n="d" place="bottom">Ezek. xxii. 14.</note>, in ſuch a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance as this? You, that are ſo impatient of every little anxiety of life; you, that cannot bear the fatigues of duty, nor the reſtraints of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how will you bear the agonies of damnation? How will you live in thoſe doleful regions, where joy and cheerfulneſs are everlaſting ſtrangers, and

nothing remains but weeping and wailing and gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of teeth<note n="a" place="bottom">Mat. xiii. 42.</note>?</p>
               <p>WERE this to be your caſe only for a thouſand or a hundred years, how miſerable would you be! but oh, how much more miſerable, when you think, that it is an everlaſting deſtruction<note n="b" place="bottom">2 Theſſ. i. 9.</note>! When your thoughts weary themſelves in ſearch of ſome diſtant point, where a glimmering of hope may break in upon you, and you go onward, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and onward ſtill, and find nothing but black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of darkneſs for ever<note n="c" place="bottom">Jude, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>AGAIN, your pious parents will lament <q>that all their kind endeavours for your ſalvation were in vain:</q> But with what aggravated ſorrow and deſpair will you then reflect on thoſe endeavours, and on all the other religious advantages you enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed!</p>
               <p>"ALAS" will you then be ready to ſay, <q>If there could be any thought of comfort in the midſt of this dark gloom of deſolation and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, it would be to transfer the blame of my rain upon another. Oh that I could I ſay, there was

ſome powerful, arbitrary being, by whoſe irreſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able hand, I was forcibly borne away, as by a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty torrent, and ſwept into this burning gulph! Oh that I could ſay, that I was wicked and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable by a fatal neceſſity!

The blood of a Redeemer was once offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me as a healing balm, and I deſpiſed it; and now it is poured out as a burning corroſive on my bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoul.

YET I muſt add once more, that as your pious parents will tremble <q>at the view of meeting you at the tribunal of God,</q> ſo the thoughts of ſuch an interview muſt be inſupportably dreadful to you.</p>
               <p>IF ſatan now draw you from your allegiance to God, and harden your heart to final impenitency, being partakers of his ſins, you will be partakers likewiſe of his plagues<note n="a" place="bottom">Rev. xviii 4.</note>, and like him, be reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in chains of darkneſs to the judgment of the great day<note n="b" place="bottom">

Shall I turn to my parents and entreat them, by all their former tenderneſs for the children of their bowels, to plead with the judge in my favour, if, perhaps, they may mitigate the rigour of his wrath?

               <p>AND is it not moſt delightful to think of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them again? Had they ſtill ſurvived, the the thoughts of leaving them might have ſharpened the pangs of diſſolving nature, which now the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of them may moderate. You had left them in an inſnaring, calamitous world; perhaps, ſome of you had left them in circumſtances of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty and diſtreſs. But now all thoſe aprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are over; and what could otherwiſe have been the ſtroke of painful ſeparation, will now be the means of ending your ſeparation, and bringing you, once for all, to the embraces of each other. And oh, with what mutual congratulations will the converſe be renewed; with what delightful overflowings of parental complacency on one ſide, and of filial gratitude on the other! how thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will they forever acknowledge your pious cares and early inſtructions, to which perhaps, under God, they owe their firſt religious impreſſions, and, in ſome ſenſe, even the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Thus do theſe words moſt ſtrongly forbid what they ſeem to allow, and are as if he had ſaid, <q>Thou poor thoughtleſs creature, who in this giddy intoxication of youth, art ſo madly bent upon ſenſual pleaſure, take thy fill of it, and withhold not thine heart from any joy. Follow all the moſt impetuous appetites of nature, and wantonly bound over every reſtraint of reaſon and piety, trample on the admonition of all thy teachers, ſhake off the fetters of a ſtrict edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and burſt the bonds of religion, like threads of flax when they are touched by the flame. But think not, Oh ſinner, that thou ſhalt always carry it off with that haughty tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph; know, that as thou haſt thy day, God will alſo have his: a day of ſtrict account, and of ample recompence.

THIS, I ſay, appears to be the evident meaning of theſe words. And that for this plain reaſon; that ſome of the phraſes made uſe of, are ſuch as are never taken in a good ſenſe, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not admit the former interpretation. Solomon doth indeed, as you have heard, exhort his readers to eat and drink, and enjoy the good of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; but where can you find him, or any other ſacred writer, exhorting or allowing men to walk in the way of their heart, and in the ſight of their eyes? I am ſure, that phraſe generally ſignifies an indulgence to the irregularities of appetite and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in the neglect of reaſon and of ſcripture. Thus the Iſraelites are charged to wear fringes on their garments<note n="a" place="bottom">Numb. xv. 39.</note>, that they might remember all the commandments of the Lord, and do them; and might not ſeek after their own heart, and their own eyes; that is, (as it follows,) that they might not go a whoring from God after thoſe gay and luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious idolatries, which regaled the ſenſes, while they debauched the ſoul. And thus the wicked Iſraelite, whom God would ſeparate to evil out of all the tribes, is repreſented as vainly and arrogant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaying<note n="b" place="bottom">De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

To theſe general remarks on the uſual ſignification of the phraſes occuring here, we may alſo farther add, that the connection of theſe words would lead us to underſtand them as an ironical rather than a ſerious conceſſion, ſince they conclude with what ſeems a very awful menace. But know thou that for all theſe things God will bring thee into judgment: as he ſhould have ſaid, "Aſſure thyſelf thou muſt anſwer for all."

This led him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, Surely God will judge the righteous and the wicked<note n="c" place="bottom">chap. iii. 17.</note>; which in many of theſe caſes could only be done in ſome inviſible ſtate, to which both ſhould be reſerved. And of this judgment he ſolemnly warns the young ſinner, as a moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful antidote againſt the baits of ſenſuality; as an awful thought, which might ſix the moſt roving eye, and be a means of reducing the moſt ungov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erned heart to the dicipline of wiſdom and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>

               <p>NOR muſt I by any means omit that grand ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage which the goſpel gives us in theſe addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, by the diſcovery of the bleſſed Jeſus under the character of a Saviour. It diſplays him as the chief among ten thouſand, and altogether lovely; as inviting, as waiting, as pleading, as weeping over ſinners, yea, as bleeding and dying for them: as deſcribing the terrors of judgment, that he may awaken them to ſlee from it, and may gather them, as a hen gathers her chickens under its compaſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate protecting wings<note n="b" place="bottom">Mat. xxiii. 37</note>.
