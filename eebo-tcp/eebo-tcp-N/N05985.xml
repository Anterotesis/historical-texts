            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y this Time, I ſuppoſe, you have heard of my having been at <hi>Liſbon,</hi> and are wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what led me thither, eſpecially ſince my laſt informed you of my Intention to go to <hi>Georgia</hi> by way of <hi>New-York.</hi> This was really my Deſign at the Time of my writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but being afterward called by Providence to take with me ſeveral Orphan-children, I thought it moſt adviſeable to go and ſettle them, and my other domeſtick Affairs, at the Orphan-houſe firſt; that I might viſit the northern Parts of <hi>America</hi> with more Eaſe and Freedom in my own Mind.—It happened that the <hi>Succeſs,</hi> Capt. <hi>Thomſon,</hi> bound for <hi>Port Royal, South Carolina,</hi> (which is not very far from <hi>Georgia</hi>) was then almoſt ready to ſail.—I ſent for the Owner, and finding that the Ship was to touch at <hi>Liſbon</hi> to unload ſome Wheat, it occaſioned a little Demurr; but, upon ſecond Thoughts, believing it might be ſerviceable to me, as a Preacher and Proteſtant, to ſee ſomething of the Superſtitions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I took my Paſſage and embarked in the <hi>Succeſs</hi> the 7th of <hi>March.</hi>—On the 14th we reached <hi>Cape Finiſter.</hi>—On the 15th came in ſight of the <hi>Burlings;</hi> and on the 16th anchored ſafe before <hi>Bellem,</hi> about four Miles diſtance from <hi>Liſbon</hi> City, the Metropolis of <hi>Portugal.</hi>—As I knew no-body there, and had formed but an indifferent Idea of the Inhabitants, from the Account that had been given me
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007590_0004_102BA555644AC968"/>
of them, I had purpoſed within myſelf to keep on Board, and go aſhore only now and then in the Day-time.—But Providence ſo ordered it, that a Gentleman of the Factory, who had heard me himſelf, and whoſe Brother had been awakened under my Miniſtry ſeveral Years ago, immediately, upon hearing of my Arrival, ſent me an Offer of his Houſe during my Stay.—I thankfully accepted it; and ſpecial Leave being procured for my going aſhore, I was carried in a Chaiſe and Pair from <hi>Bellem</hi> to <hi>Liſbon.</hi>—A new Scene, both in reſpect to the Situation of the Place, the Faſhion of the Buildings, and the Dreſs of the Inhabitants, preſented itſelf all the way.—But what engaged my Attention moſt, was the Frequency of Crucifixes and little Images of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and other real or reputed Saints, which were placed almoſt in every Street, or fixed againſt the Walls of the Houſes almoſt at every Turning, with Lamps hanging before them.—To theſe I obſerved the People bow as they paſſed along; and near ſome of them ſtood ſeveral little Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, ſinging with great Earneſtneſs.—This ſeemed to me very odd, and gave me an Idea of what further eccleſiaſtical Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities would probably fall in my way, if I ſhould be detained any time here.—Theſe Expectations were quickly raiſed;—For, not long after my Arrival at my new Lodgings, (where I was received and entertained with great Gentility, Hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and Friendlineſs) upon looking out of the Window, I ſaw a Company of Prieſts and Friars bearing lighted Wax-Tapers, and attended by various ſorts of People, ſome of which had Bags and Baſkets of Victuals in their Hands, and others carried Proviſions upon their Shoulders on Sticks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two. After theſe followed a mixed Multitude, ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a very audible Voice, and addreſſing the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> in their uſual Strain, "<hi>Ora pro nobis.</hi>" In this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they proceeded to the Priſon, where all was depoſited for the Uſe of the poor Perſons confined therein.—But a far more pompous Proceſſion of the like Nature (as a Stander-by informed me) paſſed by a few Days after.—In this there were near three hundred Franciſcan Friars, many of which
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007590_0005_102BA531F97D7BC8"/>
(beſides Porters hired for the Purpoſe) were loaded with a Variety of Food; and thoſe who bore no Burden, carried either Ladles or Spoons in their Hands.—Sights of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being quite a Novelty to me, I was fond of attending as many of them as I could. Two things concurred to make them more frequent at this Juncture, <hi>viz.</hi> the Seaſon of <hi>Lent,</hi> and an exceſſive Drought, which threatened the total De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Fruits of the Earth.—For the averting ſo great a Judgement, and for the imploring the much longed-for Bleſſing of Rain, daily Proceſſions had been made from one Convent or another for a conſiderable Time.—One of theſe I ſaw: It was looked upon as a pretty grand one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made up of the Carmelite Friars, the Pariſh Prieſts, and a great Number of what they call the Brothers of the Order, who walked two by two in divers Habits, holding a long and very large lighted Wax-taper in their right Hands.—Amidſt theſe was carried, upon eight or ten Mens Shoulders, a tall Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> in a kind of Man's Attire; for I think ſhe had a very fine white Wig on her Head, (a Dreſs ſhe often appears in) and was much adorned with Jewels and glittering Stones.—At ſome Diſtance from the Lady, under a large Canopy of State, and ſupported likewiſe by ſix or eight Perſons, came a Prieſt, holding in his Hand ſome noted Relick.—After him followed ſeveral Thouſands of People, joining with the Friars in ſinging <q>
                  <hi>Eandem cantile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam, Ora pro nobis,</hi>
               </q> all the way.—Still Rain was denied, and ſtill Proceſſions were continued.—At length the Clouds began to gather, and the Mercury in the Barometer fell very much.—Then was brought out a wooden Image, which they ſay never failed.—It was the Figure of our Bleſſed Lord, cloathed with purple Robes, and crowned with Thorns. I think they call him the LORD OF THE PASSION.—Upon his Shoulders he bore a large Croſs, under the Weight of which he was repreſented as ſtooping, 'till his Body bent al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt double.—He was brought from the <hi>Le Graſs</hi> Convent in very great Pomp, and placed in a large Cathedral Church.—Being on Board at that Time I loſt this Sight: But the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007590_0006_102BA557798F5DE8"/>
Evening I beheld the SEIGNEUR fixed on an Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence in a large Cathedral Church, near the Altar, ſurrounded with Wax-tapers of a prodigious Size.—He was attended by many Noble-men, and Thouſands of Spectators of all Ranks and Stations, who crouded from every Quarter, and, in their Turns, were admitted by the Guards to come within the Rails and perform their Devotions.—This they expreſſed by kneeling, and kiſſing the SEIGNEUR'S Heel, by putting their left and right Eye to it, and then touching it with their Beads, which a Gentleman in waiting received from them, and then returned again.—This Scene was repeated for three Days ſucceſſively; and during all this time the Church and Space before it was ſo thronged with Carriages and People, that there was ſcarce any paſſing.—The Muſick on this Occaſion was extremely ſoft, and the Church was illuminated in a very ſtriking Manner.—The third Day in the Forenoon it rained, and ſoon after the SEIGNEUR was conducted home in as great Splendour, and much greater Rejoicing, than when he was brought forth.—As my Situation was very commodious, I ſaw the whole; and afterwards went and heard Part of the Sermon, which was delivered before him in the Church to which the SEIGNEUR belonged.—The Preacher was full of Action; and in ſome Part of his Diſcourſe, (as one who underſtood <hi>Portugueſe</hi> informed me) pointing to the Image, he ſaid, <q>Now he is at Reſt.—He went out in Juſtice, but is returned in Mercy.</q>—And towards the Concluſion he called upon the People to join with him in an extempore Prayer. This they did with great Fervency, which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed not only by repeating it loud, but by beating their Breaſts, and clapping their Cheeks, and weeping heartily.—To compleat the Solemnity, immediately after the delivery of the Bleſſing, all on a ſudden, from the Place near which the Image ſtood, there was heard a moſt ſoft and ſoothing Symphony of Muſic, which being ended, the Aſſembly broke up, and I returned to my Lodgings, not a little affected to ſee ſo many Thouſands led away from the Simplicity of the Goſpel, by ſuch a Mixture of human Artifice and blind Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007590_0007_102BA53381C9CB50"/>
of which indeed I could have formed no Idea, had I not been an Eye-Witneſs of it myſelf.—This Concern was ſtill increaſed by what I heard from ſome of my fellow Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, who informed me, that about eleven one Night, after I came aboard, they not only heard a Fryar preaching moſt fervently before the SEIGNEUR, but alſo ſaw ſeveral Companies of Penitents brought in, laſhing and whipping themſelves ſeverely.—How little unlike this to thoſe who cut themſelves with Knives and Lancets, and cried out from Morning till Night, "<hi>O Baal hear us.</hi>"—Methinks I hear you ſay, and had I been preſent, I ſhould have wiſhed for the Spirit of an <hi>Elijah</hi> to—Huſh, my Friend—I am content to gueſs at the reſt 'till we meet.—In the mean while, let us comfort ourſelves with this Thought, that there is a Seaſon approaching, when the Lord God of <hi>Elijah</hi> will him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf come, and deſtroy this and every other Species of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt <hi>by the Breath of his Mouth, and the Brightneſs of his appearing,</hi> even by the all-conquering Manifeſtations of his Eternal Spirit.—Whether as Men, Chriſtians, and Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, we have not more and more Reaſon to pray Night and Day for the haſtening on of that glorious and long wiſhed-for Period, you will be better able to judge, when I ſend you (as I purpoſe to do, if I have Time) a further Account of a <hi>Lent</hi> Proceſſion or two, of which I was alſo a Spectator—At preſent I can only beg a continual Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance at a Throne of Grace, as being, my dear Friend,</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HOUGH ſome other Buſineſs demands my At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, yet I muſt not forget the Promiſe made you of a further Account of the Proceſſions I ſaw at <hi>Liſbon.</hi>—Some of thoſe already mentioned were extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, by Reaſon of their great Drought; but that which is to be the Subject of my preſent Letter was an annual one; it being always cuſtomary at <hi>Liſbon</hi> to exhibit ſome Proceſſion or another every <hi>Friday</hi> in Lent.—An intelligent Proteſtant who ſtood near me, was ſo good as to be my Interpreter of the Dumb Shew as it paſſed along—I ſay <hi>Dumb Shew</hi>—For you muſt know it was chiefly made up of waxen or wooden Images, and carried on Mens Shoulders through the Streets, intending to repreſent the Life and Death of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> the Founder of one of their religious Orders.—They were brought out from the <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Convent, and were preceded by three Perſons in ſcarlet Habits with Baſkets in their Hands, in which they received the Alms of the Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators, for the Benefit of the poor Priſoners.—After theſe, came two little Boys in Party-colour'd Cloaths, with Wings fixed on their Shoulders, in Imitation of little Angels.—Then appeared the Figure of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> very gay and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, as he uſed to be before his Converſion.—In the next, he was introduced under Conviction, and conſequently ſtript of his Finery.—Soon after this was exhibited, an Image of our Bleſſed Lord himſelf, in a purple Gown with long black Hair, with St. <hi>Francis</hi> lying before him, to receive his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Orders.—Then came the Virgin Mother, (<hi>horreſco referens</hi>) with Chriſt her Son at her left Hand, and St. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> making his Obeyſance to both.—Here, if I remember
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007590_0009_102BA5368BC66780"/>
aright, he made his firſt Appearance in his Friar's Habit with his Hair cut ſhort, but not as yet ſhaved in the Crown of his Head:—After a little Space followed a mitred Cardinal gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily attired, and before him lay St. <hi>Francis</hi> almoſt proſtrate, in order to be confirmed in his Office.—Soon after this he appears quite metamorphoſed into a Monk, his Crown ſhorn, his Habit black, and his Loins girt with a Knotted Cord.—Here he prays to our Saviour hanging on a Croſs, that the Marks of the Wounds in his Hands, Feet, and Side, might be impreſſed on the ſame Parts of his Body.—The Prayer is granted; Blood comes from the Hands, Feet, and Side; and the Saint with great Devotion receives the Impreſſions.—This was repreſented by red waxen Strings, reaching from thoſe Parts of the Image to the correſponding Parts of St. <hi>Francis</hi> his Body.—Upon this he begins to do Wonders; and therefore in a little while he was carried along, holding up a Houſe which was juſt falling.—This Miracle they ſay was performed (if my Information be true) at <hi>Madrid,</hi> but the Particulars of its Hiſtory I have forgotten.—At length the Father dies, and is brought forth lying in his Grave.—But lo! the Briars and Nettles under which he lay, are turned into fine and fragrant Flowers.—After this he is born along upon a Bier covered with a Silver Pall, and four Friars lamenting over him.—He then appears for the laſt Time, but with an Increaſe of Power; for he was repreſented as drawing tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented People out of Purgatory with his knotted Cord, which, as you may well imagine, the poor Souls catched at, and took Hold of very eagerly.—At length came a gorgeous Friar un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſplendid Canopy, bearing in his Hand a Piece of the Holy Croſs.—After him followed two more little winged Boys, and then a long Train of fat and well-favoured <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcans</hi> with their <hi>Calceis Feneſtratis,</hi> as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> calls them; and ſo the Proceſſion ended. Methinks I hear you ſay, it is full Time—And ſo ſay I—For as the Sight itſelf diſguſted me, ſo I am perſuaded the bare Narration of it, though ever ſo ſhort, cannot be very pleaſant to you, who I know abhor every Thing that ſavours of Superſtition and Idolatry.—We

will therefore take our Leave of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> whoſe Proceſſion was in the Day Time; but I muſt tell you it is only to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you of another of a much more awful and ſhocking Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which I ſaw afterwards by Night.—It was about Ten o'Clock, when being deeply engaged in Converſation with my kind Hoſt, in came an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> and told me in all Haſte, that he had ſeen a Train of near two hundred Penitents paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing along, and that in all Probability I might be gratified with the ſame Sight, if I haſtened to a Place whither he would conduct me.—I very readily obey'd the Summons, and, as Curioſity quickened my Pace, we ſoon came up with ſome of thoſe poor Creatures, who were then making a Halt, and kneeling in the Street, whilſt a Friar from a high Croſs, with an Image of our LORD Crucified in his Hand, was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, and the Populace, with great Vehemence.—Sermon being ended, the Penitents, who had already been preached to, went forwards, and ſeveral Companies followed after with their reſpective preaching Friars at their Head bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Crucifixes.—Theſe they pointed to and brandiſhed fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and the Hearers as frequently beat their Breaſts and clap'd their Cheeks—At proper Pauſes they ſtopped and prayed; and one of them, more zealous than the reſt, before the King's Palace, ſounded out the Word <hi>Penitentia</hi> through a ſpeaking Trumpet.—The Penitents themſelves were clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed and covered all over with white linen Veſtments, only Holes were made for their Eyes to peep out at.—All were barefooted, and all had long heavy Chains faſtened to their Ancles, which, when dragg'd along the Street, made a diſmal rattling: But though alike in Dreſs, yet in other Reſpects there was great Variety amongſt them—For ſome carried great Stones on their Backs, and others dead Mens Bones and Skulls in their Hands.—Some bore large and ſeemingly very heavy Croſſes upon their Shoulders, whilſt others had their Arms extended quite wide, or carried a Bow full of Swords with the Points downwards—Moſt of them whipped and laſhed themſelves, ſome with Cords, and others with flat Bits of Iron—It being a Moonſhine Night, I could ſee them quite

well; and indeed ſome of them ſtruck ſo hard, that I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that their Backs (left bare on purpoſe to be ſlaſh'd) were quite red, and ſwoln very much by the Violence and Repetition of the Blows—Had my dear Friend been there, he would have join'd with me in ſaying, that the whole Scene was horrible—So horrible, that, being informed it was to be continued 'till Morning, I was glad to return from whence I came, about Midnight—Had you been with me, I know you would have joined in praiſing and gratefully adoring the LORD of all Lords, not only for the great Wonder of the Reformation, but alſo for that glorious Deliverance wrought out for us, in ſtopping of our late unnatural Rebellion—Oh with what a mighty Spirit and Power from on high, muſt <hi>Luther, Calvin, Melancthon, Zui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Rovidence ſtill detains us at <hi>Liſbon,</hi> and therefore I know you will be enquiring what more News from thence?—Truly, as extraordinary as ever—For I have now ſeen the Solemnities of a <hi>Holy Thurſday,</hi> which is a very high Day in this Metropolis, and particularly remarkable for the grand Illuminations of the Churches, and the King's waſhing twelve poor Mens Feet.—Through the Intereſt of a Friend I got Admittance into the Gallery where the Ceremony was performed.—It was large, and hung with Tapeſtry; one Piece of which repreſented the humble <hi>Jeſus</hi> waſhing the Feet of his Diſciples.—Before this, upon a ſmall Eminence, ſat twelve Men in black.—At the upper End, and ſeveral other Parts of the Gallery, were Sideboards of Gold and Silver large Baſons and Ewers moſt curiouſly wrought; and near theſe a large Table covered with a Variety of Diſhes, all cold, ſet off and garniſhed after the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Faſhion.—Publick high Maſs being over, his Majeſty came in, attended with his Nobles, who ſeemed to me to look like ſo many <hi>Roman</hi> Senators.—The very Act of waſhing the Feet, I did not get in time enough to ſee; but that being ended, ſeveral of the young Noblemen ſerved up the Diſhes to the King's Brother and Uncles; Theſe again handed them to his Majeſty, who gave (I think) twelve of them in all to each poor Man.—Every thing was carried on with a great deal of Decency and good Humour.—The young Noblemen ſerved very chearfully, their Seniors looked quite pleaſed, and the King and his royal Relations behaved in a very polite, eaſy manner.—Upon the whole, though, as you may eaſily gueſs, it was not an exact Copy of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtry
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007590_0013_102BA53C6C75D600"/>
yet, as the poor Mens Cloaths and Food, when ſold, came to about ten Moidores, and as there was little Mixture of Superſtition in it, I cannot ſay but I was as well pleaſed with my Morning's Entertainment as with any Thing I had met with ſince my Arrival.—I believe the whole took up near two Hours.—After Dinner we went to ſee the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; but the Magnificence and Sumptuouſneſs of the Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, on this Occaſion, cannot well be expreſſed.—Many of them were hung with purple Damaſk trimmed with Gold.—In one of them there was a ſolid ſilver Altar of ſeveral Yards Circumference, and near twelve Steps high: And in another a gold one, ſtill more magnificent, of about the ſame Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.—Its Baſis was ſtudded with many precious Stones, and near the Top were placed ſilver Images, in Repreſentation of Angels.—Each Step was filled with large ſilver Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, with Wax-tapers in them, which, going up by a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Aſcent 'till they formed themſelves into a Pyramid, made a moſt glittering and ſplendid Blaze—The great Altars alſo of the other Churches were illuminated moſt profuſely, and ſilver Pots of artificial Flowers, with a large Wax-taper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween each, were fixed all round ſeveral of them—Between theſe were large Paintings in black and white, repreſenting the different Parts of our Saviour's Paſſion—And, in ſhort, all was ſo magnificently, ſo ſuperſtitiouſly grand, that I am perſuaded ſeveral Thouſands of Pounds would not defray the Expences of this one Day—Go which Way you would, nothing was to be ſeen but Illuminations within, and Hurry without—For all Perſons, the Crowned Heads themſelves not excepted, are obliged on this Day to viſit ſeven Churches or Altars, in Imitation, as is ſuppoſed, of our LORD's being hurried from one Tribunal to another, before he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to be hung upon the Croſs—I ſaw the Queen paſs by in great State to viſit three of them—Velvet Cuſhions were carried before her Majeſty, and Boards laid along the Streets for Herſelf and Retinue to walk upon—Guards at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended before and behind, and Thouſands of Spectators ſtood on each Side to gaze at them as they paſſed along—Being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous

of ſeeing the Manner of their Entrance, we got into the laſt Church before they came—It was that of St. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingo,</hi> where was the gold Altar before mentioned, and at which her Majeſty and Train knelt about a Quarter of an Hour—All the while the <hi>Dominican</hi> Friars ſung moſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſingly ſweet—But as I ſtood near the Altar, over againſt the great Door, I muſt confeſs my very inmoſt Soul was ſtruck with a ſecret Horror, when, upon looking up, I ſaw, over the Front of the great Window of the Church, the heads of many hundred <hi>Jews,</hi> painted on Canvas, who had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned (by what they call the <hi>Holy Inquiſition)</hi> and carried out from that Church to be burnt—Strange way this, of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling People to come in!—Such was not thy Method, O meek and compaſſionate Lamb of God!—Thou cameſt not to deſtroy Mens Lives, but to ſave them—But Bigotry is as cruel as the Grave—It knows no Remorſe—From all its bitter and dire Effects, <hi>Good LORD deliver us.</hi>—But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Queen—Having performed her Devotions, ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, and went in a Coach of State, I believe, directly from the Church to her Palace, and without doubt ſufficiently fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued. For, beſides walking through the Streets to the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Churches, her Majeſty alſo, and the Princeſſes, had been engaged in waiting upon and waſhing the Feet of twelve poor Women, in as publick a Manner as the King—In our Walk home we met His Majeſty with his Brother and two Uncles, attended only with a few Noblemen in black Velvet, and a few Guards without Halberts—I ſuppoſe he was returning from his laſt Church, and, as one may well imagine, equally fatigued with his royal Conſort and Daughters—When Church and State thus combine to be nurſing Fathers and nurſing Mothers to Superſtition, is it any Wonder that its Credit and Influence is ſo diffuſive among the Populace?—.O <hi>Britain!

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>FTER the News ſent you in my laſt, I thought our <hi>Liſbon</hi> Correſpondence would entirely have been put a Stop to.—For upon returning to my Lodgings, (as weary I believe as others that had been running from Church to Church all Day) Word was ſent me, that our Ship would certainly ſail next Morning.—This News, I own, was not altogether agreeable to me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I wanted to ſee the Concluſion of the <hi>Lent</hi> Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.—However, I made ready; and having diſpatched my private Affairs the Over-night, was conducted very early in the Morning, by my kind Hoſt, down to <hi>Bellem,</hi> where the Ship lay.—We parted.—The Wind promiſed to be fair; but dying away, I very eagerly went aſhore once more.—But how was the Scene changed; Before, all uſed to be Noiſe and Hurry—Now, all was huſhed and ſhut up in the moſt awful and profound Silence.—No Clock or Bell had been heard ſince Yeſterday Noon, and ſcarce a Perſon was to be ſeen in the Street all the way to <hi>Liſbon.</hi>—About Two in the Afternoon we got to the Place where (I had heard ſome Days ago) an extraordinary Scene was to be exhibited—Can you gueſs what it was?—Perhaps not.—Why then I will tell you.—<q>
                  <hi>It was the Crucifixion of the Son of God, repreſented partly by dumb Images, and partly by living Perſons, in a
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007590_0016_102BA5621E25B660"/>
large Church belonging to the Convent of St.</hi> De Beato.</q>—Several thouſands crouded into it; ſome of which, as I was told, had been waiting there ever ſince Six in the Morning—Through the kind Interpoſition and Aſſiſtance of a Proteſtant or two, I was not only admitted into the Church, but was very commodiouſly ſituated to view the whole Performance. We had not waited long before the Curtain was drawn up.—Immediately, upon a high Scaffold, hung in the Front with black Bays, and behind with ſilk purple Damaſk laced with Gold, was exhibited to our View an Image of the LORD JESUS at full Length, crowned with Thorns, and nailed on a Croſs, between two Figures of like Dimenſions, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the two Thieves—At a little Diſtance, on the right Hand, was placed an Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> in plain long Ruffles, and a kind of Widow-weeds—Her Veil was purple Silk, and ſhe had a wire Glory round her Head—At the Foot of the Croſs lay, in a mournful penſive Poſture, a living Man, dreſſed in Woman's Cloaths, who perſonated <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len;</hi> and not far off ſtood a young Man, in Imitation of the beloved Diſciple—He was dreſſed in a looſe green ſilk Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Bob-wig—His Eyes were fixed on the Croſs, and his two Hands a little extended—On each Side, near the Front of the State, ſtood two Centinels in Buff, with formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Caps and long Beards; and directly in the Front ſtood another yet more formidable, with a large Target in his Hand—We may ſuppoſe him to be the <hi>Roman</hi> Centurion—To compleat the Scene, from behind the purple Hangings came out about twenty little purple-veſted winged Boys, two by two, each bearing a lighted Wax-taper in his Hand, and a Crimſon and Gold Cap on his Head—At their Entrance upon the Stage they gently bowed their Heads to the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, then kneeled and made Obeyſance, firſt to the Image on the Croſs, and then to that of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi>—When riſen, they bowed to each other, and then took their reſpective Places over-againſt one another, on Steps aſſigned for them at the Front of the Stage—Oppoſite to this, at a few Yards diſtance, ſtood a black Friar, in a Pulpit hung in Mourning—For a

while he pauſed, and then breaking Silence, gradually lifted up his Voice 'till it was extended to a pretty high Pitch, tho' I think ſcarce high enough for ſo large an Auditory—After he had proceeded in his Diſcourſe about a Quarter of an Hour, a confuſed Noiſe was heard near the front great Door; and, upon turning my Head, I ſaw four long-bearded Men; two of which carried a Ladder on their Shoulders, and after them followed two more with large gilt Diſhes in their Hands, full of Linen, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Determined to ſee the whole, I waited its Return, and in about a quarter of an Hour the Corps was brought in, and depoſited in an open Sepulchre prepared for the Purpoſe; but not before a Prieſt, accompanied by ſeveral of the ſame Order in ſplendid Veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, had perfumed it with Incenſe, ſung to and kneeled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it—<hi>John</hi> and <hi>Magdalen</hi> attended the Obſequies; but the Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was carried away and placed upon the Front of the Stage, in order to be kiſs'd, ador'd, and worſhipped by the People—This I ſaw them do with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Eargerneſs and Reverence—And thus ended this <hi>Good Friday'</hi>s Tragi-comical, ſuperſtitious, idolatrous <hi>Droll</hi>—A <hi>Droll,</hi> which whilſt I ſaw, as well as now whilſt I am deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, excited in me a high Indignation—Surely thought I, whilſt attending on ſuch a Scene of mock Devotion, if ever, now is the dear Lord Jeſus crucified afreſh; and I could then, and even now, think of no other Plea for the poor beguiled De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votees, than that which ſuffering Innocence put up himſelf for his Enemies, when actually hanging upon the Croſs, viz.
