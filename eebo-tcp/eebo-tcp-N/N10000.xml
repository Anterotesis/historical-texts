            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>I LITTLE thought when I wrote theſe Sermons they would ever have been more public than the Preaching would make them. That they were compoſed in haſte, under many Avocations, and in early Life, are Reaſons why I ſhould decline com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them to the Preſs. But when I conſider that Affection you ſhewed me when I firſt came among you, the great Kindneſſes and ſteady Attachment I have ever ſince experienced, and the very general and repeated Deſire expreſſed for their Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication: I thought it not beſt to refuſe, and this muſt be my Apology to the World.</p>
            <p>THE Subject of them (Salvation) is the greateſt and nobleſt, and demands your moſt ſerious Attention. And might I hope what is here offered would awaken or
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:012709_0004_0F8B8E1F828A92E0"/>
ſtrengthen in you a juſt Senſe of it; it would give me a Satisfaction and Joy inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible. "For what is our Hope or Joy, or Crown of Rejoicing, are not even ye in the Preſence of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt at his coming."</p>
            <p>TO lead you to believe in Jeſus as the Way, the Truth and the Life, as the only Foundation of your preſent or future Happineſs; and to excite you to a Temper and Conduct worthy his Name, has been the Deſign of my conſtant Preaching. Faith in Chriſt, and a practical Subjection to his Goſpel, I pray may ever be your habitual and diſtinguiſhing Character.</p>
            <p>THAT my Miniſtry may be ſucceſsful to theſe Purpoſes, that I may have a daily Remembrance in your Prayers; and that the beſt of Heaven's Bleſſings may reſt on you and your's, is the ſincere Deſire of your affectionate Friend and Paſtor,</p>

            <p>THIS World is the Place of our Birth but not of our Abode; we cannot expect always to continue here. There muſt be a Time, and how ſoon is known only to God, when we are to be called hence, muſt quit the Scene. That an End ſhould be put to our Being is not to be ſuppoſed. Reaſon tells us otherwiſe, and Revelation certainly aſſerts the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; and we have as much Evidence as we can, 'till we arrive at our deſtined Home. A ſerious, an earneſt Concern about our future Condition, muſt be both our Duty and Intereſt. We know the ſtate <hi>there</hi> is different: Everlaſting Happineſs or Miſery;
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:012709_0006_0F8B8E209236F2D8"/>
and as we realize theſe, ſo ſhall we be ſollicitous about the Queſtion in the Text, "what muſt I do to be ſaved?"</p>
            <p>IN ſome preceeding Verſes we find Paul and Silas going to their Devotions in the Houſe of Lydia, who had been converted to the Chriſtian Faith and baptized. While paſſing, they met a Woman poſſeſſed of the Spirit of Divination, and who brought by this Means her Maſters much Money. She declared to the People who they were; and they being grieved to ſee her in ſuch unhappy Circumſtances, commanded the Spirit by whom ſhe was poſſeſſed, to leave her. Her Maſters finding that now their Hopes of further Profit were at an End, were enraged at Paul and Silas, and entered a Complaint to the Magiſtrates—that they exceedingly troubled the City—taught Cuſtoms which were not lawful for them to receive, neither to obſerve, being Romans. They were therefore commanded to be beaten, caſt into Priſon; and Orders given
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:012709_0007_0F8B8E21442E7328"/>
to the Jailor to keep them ſafely: Who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received ſuch a Charge thruſt them into the inner Priſon, and made their Feet faſt in the Stocks. They were not intimidated with theſe Things, but at Midnight and when all were aſleep, they prayed and ſang Praiſes to God. Upon this there was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly a great Earthquake, ſo that the Foundations of the Priſon were ſhaken, and immediately all the Doors were opened and every one's Bands were looſed. And the Keeper of the Priſon awaking out of his Sleep, and ſeeing the Priſon-Doors open, he drew out his Sword, and would have killed himſelf, ſuppoſing, the Priſoners had fled. But Paul cried with a loud Voice, ſaying, do thyſelf no Harm, for We are all here. Then he called for a Light and ſprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas, and brought them out and ſaid as in our Text, Sirs, what muſt I do to be ſaved?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:012709_0008_0F8B8E22051EDA20"/>"GOD, we are told, does often rouſe up Men's ſleepy and ſenſeleſs and lethargic Minds by ſome preſent Terror, Judgment or Affliction, which brings them to conſider the Concerns of their Souls and another World, when Nothing elſe will. This ſhakes off their thoughtleſs Security, and alarms their ſtupid and unthinking Minds, to look about them, and ſee what a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Condition they are in." But if this ſhould not be the Caſe, yet the Queſtion aſked by the Jailor is important and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; and if properly conſidered may be uſeful to us.</p>
            <p>I SHALL therefore make two or three Obſervations therefrom.</p>
            <p>FIRST. We may obſerve the vaſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of Salvation.</p>
            <p>THIS the Jailor ſuppoſed when he aſked the Queſtion, and this muſt be by Others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:012709_0009_0F8B8E22CAC6B678"/>MAN was made upright, but he ſoon ſought out many Inventions. Sin has enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the World, and Death by Sin, and ſo Death has paſſed upon all Men, for that all have ſinned. We are the Children of fallen Man, and are Ourſelves Sinners. The Importance of Salvation therefore, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if we conſider—The unhappy Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Perſons without it—and Bleſſedneſs of ſuch as poſſeſs it.</p>
            <p>THOSE who are not in a State of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation are defiled and corrupted. They are eſtranged from God, under the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of Sin, and are diſpoſed ſo to continue; they are unclean and unholy. This is the Caſe with All who reject and refuſe the Salvation offered them, have not received nor are influenced by it. The Apoſtles found it ſo in their Day. They declare of the Gentile World, that they were Enemies of God, being in a State of Idolatry and Unrighteouſneſs.<note n="†" place="bottom">Epheſ. II. 1.</note> That they
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012709_0010_0F8B8E238B2FA1D8"/>
were dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins, wherein in Time paſt they walked according to the Courſe of this World, according to the Prince of the Power of the Air, the Spirit that now worketh in the Children of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience. That <note n="*" place="bottom">Epheſ. iv. 17, 18.</note> they walked generally in the Vanity of their Mind, having their Underſtanding darkened, being alienated from the Life of God, through the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that is in them, becauſe of the Blindneſs of their Heart: Who being paſt Feeling have given themſelves over to work all Uncleanneſs with Greedineſs. So cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and defiled did they find them. And as to the Jews, they were alſo, by far the greateſt Part of them, by an univerſal Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Manners, loſt in Sin. Their whole Head was ſick and their Heart was faint; and, as emblematical of their Corruption, it is repreſented that there was no Soundneſs in them, but they had Wounds and Bruiſes, and putrifying Sores. And if we conſider ſome who call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012709_0011_0F8B8E244254D510"/>
Chriſtians, and would think it hard to be deprived of the Name, yet do we not ſee many of Theſe lead unholy, ungodly Lives, notwithſtanding all the Threatnings denounced againſt Sinners, all the terrible Things recorded in the Word of God. They ſlight and diſregard them. They have ſinned, and will ſin, and will not be deterred from it. They are unconcerned about their future Condition, overlook their Souls, as though they were of no Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, can ſee them periſhing before their Eyes without Remorſe or Compunction. Such then muſt certainly be corrupted, eſtranged from God and Goodneſs, and therefore their Situation unhappy.</p>
            <p>THEY alſo continually lie under the Anger of Almighty God.</p>
            <p>IF defiled and corrupted, are eſtranged from Him, and if ſo are his Enemies, and expoſed to his Reſentment. For God is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity, and he is angry with
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012709_0012_0F8B8E269ABF0008"/>
the Wicked every Day. And the Thoughts of this ought to alarm and terrify All who are conſcious of any wilful Wickedneſs or Immorality. For who knoweth the Power of God's Anger, which can excite Horrors and Pains in the Minds of Sinners, intenſe and durable beyond all Conception and Imagination. If we are afraid of falling under the Diſpleaſure of the Great and Powerful of this World, who yet, when they have done their utmoſt, can only kill the Body, how much more fearful muſt it be to fall into the Hands of the ever living and holy God, who after he hath killed, hath Power to caſt into Hell. Certainly, when God's utter Abhorrence of Sin is conſidered, and of thoſe who are diſpoſed to continue under it's Dominion; their Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be deplorable, and evince the Importance of Salvation.</p>
            <p>AND they can have no inward Peace and Quietneſs of Mind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:012709_0013_0F8B8E2ACDA197F0"/>UNHAPPINESS muſt ever attend the Practice of Sin. Miſery comes along with it, brings Torment to the Mind and Diſeaſe to the Body. All Ungodlineſs has this Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and there are frequently Inſtances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The Fermentation of the Paſſions, and all the Effects of a ſinful Mind, muſt make Men unhappy. A State of Innocence would not have produced this. Man would have been a Stranger hereto. We read indeed of "the Pleaſures of Sin," but beſide that they are of the baſer and groſſer Kind, 'tis ſaid of them, "They are but for a Seaſon, for a Moment, and the End of them is Heavineſs. That the Ways of Sin may ſeem broad and pleaſant, but that they lead down to Death and take hold on Hell." It is <note n="†" place="bottom">Iſaiah xxxii. 17.</note> "Righteouſneſs that gives Peace, and it is the Effect of that which is Quietneſs and Aſſurance forever." It is for wicked Men to dread God, and to endeavor to baniſh the Thoughts of Him out of their Minds. What Peace and Satisfaction can
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012709_0014_0F8B8E2B96D38D38"/>
ſuch have, who muſt know that their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct is diſhonorable and ungrateful to God, unworthy their Characters, and will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of the greateſt Evils? Which brings me to ſay, that,</p>
            <p>THOSE who are not in a State of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, are liable to, and muſt ſuffer ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Miſery.</p>
            <p>"THE Wages of Sin is Death."<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. vi. 23.</note> Thoſe who reject the Means of Grace and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt expect to reap the Fruit of their own Way and be filled with their own Devices. "The ſame, ſays the Scripture,<note n="†" place="bottom">Rev. xiv. 10.</note> ſhall drink of the Wine of the Wrath of God, which is poured out without Mixture into the Cup of his Indignation, and he ſhall be tormented with Fire and Brimſtone, in the Preſence of the holy Angels, and in the Preſence of the Lamb. And the Smoke of their Torment aſcendeth up for ever and ever." That State is eternal, is what will
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012709_0015_0F8B8E2BC8C796D0"/>
know no End, and compared with which, the longeſt Life of Pleaſure, hath not the Proportion of a ſingle Moment. Such then muſt depart from the Preſence of God to dwell with Devils and damned Spirits for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, in the Place where the Worm dieth not and the Fire is not quenched.</p>
            <p>NOW let us conſider the Bleſſedneſs of thoſe who are of the contrary Character, are in a State of Salvation.</p>
            <p>THEY are delivered from the Power and Dominion of Sin. They are redeemed from all Iniquity, that Sin ſhould no longer reign in their mortal Bodies, that they might fulfil the Luſts thereof. The Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sinners we ſee is, that they are in Bondage and Slavery, ſubject to their Luſts, and to the Temptations, Arts and Cunning of a deſigning Adverſary. But thoſe who are ſaved, are in Meaſure delivered here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from. The Creature ſhall be delivered from the Bondage of Corruption into the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012709_0016_0F8B8E2C80642C88"/>
glorious Liberty of the Sons of God. Their nobler Faculties have got the Aſcendency and are triumphant. They are not carried away with every Sin and Temptation. Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity has not the Dominion, but is rejected and renounced. They have the Influences of the Spirit of God, that Comforter which was promiſed and is provided. And they poſſeſs him not as a tranſient Viſitant, but as a conſtant Gueſt; aſſiſting them to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the Deeds of the Body, overcoming their Corruptions, all the Oppoſitions they meet with, helping their Infirmities, and purifying their Souls. And they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to God, his Image and Likeneſs; are cleanſed from all Filthineſs of Fleſh and Spirit.</p>
            <p>THEY have alſo the Pardon of their Sins. And what a glorious Privilege muſt this be. "Bleſſed, <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. XXXII. 1.</note> ſays the Pſalmiſt, is he whoſe Tranſgreſſion is forgiven, whoſe Sin is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; bleſſed is the Man unto whom the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012709_0017_0F8B8E2EAE2310D0"/>
Lord imputeth not Iniquity." By this muſt be meant, a full Indemnification from all paſt Sins and Tranſgreſſions. It is to forget, forgive and remember them no more. It intends the Abolition of them, their Guilt, and freedom from the deſerved Deſtruction conſequent upon them, and a Reception to the divine Mercy. The Book is croſſed, the Debt is cancelled; and they are not ſubjected to the Payment. The Obligation to Puniſhment is made void. God no longer accounts Men ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious, but the Sentence againſt them is revoked. This aſſuredly will be the Caſe; for God is good, he is ready to forgive, he is plenteous in Mercy to all that call upon him. "There is no Condemnation to any who are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the Fleſh but after the Spirit."</p>
            <p>AND they ſhall at laſt be received to everlaſting Glory and Happineſs. They ſhall be made to enter into the Joy of their Lord. The Wicked muſt go away into
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012709_0018_0F8B8E2F155286D0"/>
everlaſting Puniſhment, but the righteous into eternal Happineſs and Life. Chriſt has purchaſed this by his Blood; entered Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by a new and living Way, and has conſecrated it for them, through his Fleſh. He gives unto them eternal Life and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any pluck them out of his Hands. We have the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations of God himſelf: who is not a Man that he ſhould lie, or the Son of Man that he ſhould repent. And who has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that they ſhall inherit the Kingdom prepared for them from the Foundation of the World.<note n="*" place="bottom">Matth. XXV. 34.</note> For he ſo loved the World as to give up his only begotten Son, that whoever believed in him might not periſh but have everlaſting Life.<note n="†" place="bottom">John III. 16.</note> This is the preſent Support, and will be the future Felicity of the Saints. "Good Men have the ſure Word of Prophecy to found and direct their Faith. Here therefore they may fix their Foot with full Aſſurance of Faith, rejoicing in Hope of the Glory of God."
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012709_0019_0F8B8E2F87EE4218"/>
Certainly then our Salvation is not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Thing, ſeeing, without it, we ſhall be forever miſerable, and with it everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly happy. And theſe muſt evidence it's Importance.</p>
            <p>DO we then ſee the Importance of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, how thankful ought we to be that it is offered us.</p>
            <p>THIS indeed is worthy our Thanks and demands our Gratitude. To God, who is the Author of it, who has found out a Way for Man whereby he may be reconciled to Him and be at Peace with his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. To Jeſus, for that Compaſſion and Grace which were ſo conſpicuous in him. God found out a Way for the Peace of Man, but that he might poſſeſs it, Chriſt himſelf dies, offers up his Body as an aton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sacrifice. For it pleaſed the Father that in him all Fulneſs ſhould dwell, and (having made Peace through the Blood of the Croſs) by him to reconcile All Things
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012709_0020_0F8B8E3097CC58A0"/>
to himſelf. And he is ſtill the Beſtower of it to Men. When therefore they are ſenſible of it's Importante, they eagerly and readily embrace the Way offered; are thankful there is one, their Hearts overflow with Joy and Gladneſs.</p>
            <p>THE vaſt Importance of Salvation ſhews us the Stupidity of thoſe who are careleſs and unconcerned about it.</p>
            <p>DID Men conſider, they could not be ſo negligent and heedleſs. It muſt be owing to their Inattention to the great Things of their Peace, that they conduct as they ſo often do: This is their Bane—this their Ruin. This is the Charge God brings againſt his People Iſrael. <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſai. I. 3.</note> "My People, ſays he, do not conſider." And in the Seventh of Hoſea he complains of the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy and Impiety of his People; but this was their Unhappineſs. "They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider not in their Hearts, that I remember
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012709_0021_0F8B8E3115757820"/>
all their wickedneſs. On Account of this, Sinners are often compared in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the brutal Creation. <note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. vii. 12.</note> "He goeth after her ſtraitway as the Ox goeth to the Slaughter, and conſidereth not that it is for his Life." Therefore is it Men are ſo eaſy as to their Wickedneſs, they do not conſider the Tendency and End thereof. "He knoweth not that the Dead are there, and her Gueſts in the Depths of Hell." "This is the Sleep and Lethargy of the Soul: It keeps Men unconcerned, though they are in the Way to Ruin, and upon the very Brink of Deſtruction." And if Men become religious, deſirous of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in good Earneſt, they muſt be awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of their Stupidity, brought to think; and to ſay, as with the Jailor, "What muſt I do to be ſaved?"</p>
            <p>LET us then be all excited by the Grace of God to conſider how great this Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, and to ſeek after it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:012709_0022_0F8B8E3346207370"/>IT is of the utmoſt Importance, demands our Attention, our greateſt Care. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering who is the Author, and who the Purchaſer; Nothing can be greater. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering Ourſelves, our Character and Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, none can need it more. No great Arguments then are wanting to excite to it. The Unhappineſs of not being ſaved is ſet before us; the Bleſſedneſs of being ſo, ſhewn us; and None can be at a ſtand. Now then is the Time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> now the accepted Time, and now the Day of Salvation. Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and Chriſt ſhall give you Life. Know in this your Day the Things that concern your everlaſting Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, before they ſhall be for ever hidden from your Eyes. Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, "conſider your Ways." "Keep your Hearts with all Diligence." Seek him to enable you to know your true Intereſt and purſue it. To do it with Alacrity, with a Zeal adequate to it's Importance and Worth.</p>

               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:012709_0023_0F8B8E34030AD2E8"/>THE SECOND OBSERVATION I make from the Words is, That there is Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be done by us, in order to our being ſaved. Here we ſhall endeavor to conſider—What is to be done—and then evince the Truth of it.</p>
            <p n="1">I. WHAT is to be done.</p>
            <p>NOW if we look into the Verſe following our Text, we ſhall find the Direction of Paul and Silas to the Jailor, when he aſked what he ſhould do to be ſaved. They ſaid "Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved." This is what he was directed to, and this muſt be done by others, would they be ſaved.</p>
            <p>FAITH or BELIEF in general, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined as a Perſwaſion of the Mind, or Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to ſome Truth, or the Exiſtence of a Perſon, or Thing; and this upon the Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of thoſe that declare it. And thus it is ſaid to differ from other Kinds of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012709_0024_0F8B8E35D09A1388"/>
Knowledge; becauſe in them we aſſent upon the clear and plain Reaſon of Things, and here upon the Authority of Perſons; and therefore our Faith is firm or weak in proportion to the ſuppoſed Ability and Honeſty of him that teſtifies. There are different Kinds of Faith, and accordingly have different Objects; as human, divine, and chriſtian. It is the laſt that is here intended, and therefore Chriſt is the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecte "Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt." Now this is,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. To believe the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>OUR bleſſed Lord made a Declaration of his Father's Will to the World, and that "in thoſe Sermons, Parables and Diſcourſes of his which we find recorded in the four Evangeliſts, in which the Will of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Way and Method of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is revealed. The Apoſtle Paul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xx. 27.</note> to the Elders of the Church at
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012709_0025_0F8B8E38027929D8"/>
Epheſus, that he had not ſhuned to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the whole Counſel of God. And this Counſel which he had preached was that Account of our Savior's Diſcourſes and Actions we have in the Goſpel." And whoever therefore believes the Goſpel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves its Hiſtory and its Doctrine.</p>
            <p>THE HISTORY. Thar there was ſuch a Perſon as Jeſus Chriſt, and as there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. That he was the Son of God. In this Character he is repreſented. <note n="†" place="bottom">i Luke i. 35.</note> That holy Thing, ſays the Angel to Mary, which ſhall be born of thee ſhall be called the Son of God. This is the Character of one who is born of God and overcomes the World, that he believes that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God.<note n="‡" place="bottom">1 John v. 5.</note> So when any were converted to the Chriſtian Faith, they believed this. Thus the Eunuch tells Philip,<note n="‖" place="bottom">Acts VIII. 37.</note> I believe that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God. And the Apoſtle Paul after his Converſion believed, and ſo preached
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012709_0026_0F8B8E38C7D46CD0"/>
Chriſt that he is the Son of God. And 'tis ſaid of every one that ſhall confeſs that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God, that God dwelleth in him, and he in God.<note n="*" place="bottom">1 John IV. 15.</note> So is it alſo ſaid, that he was ſent of God. God ſo loved the World that he gave his only begotten Son. And Chriſt ſays, I proceeded forth and came from God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came I of myſelf, but He ſent Me. And being thus ſent, that he lived as is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, performed thoſe wonderful Things recorded, ſuffered an ignominious Death on the Croſs, was laid in the Grave, roſe from the Dead and aſcended to Glory.</p>
            <p>HIS DOCTRINE is ſaid to contain Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, Promiſes and Threatnings. And a Faith in Chriſt includes a firm Belief of theſe, "of the Precepts of the Goſpel as the Matter of our Duty, and the Rule of our Life; and of the Promiſes and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of it as Arguments to our Duty, to encourage our Obedience and deter us
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:012709_0027_0F8B8E3948CEA380"/>
from Sin." So that he who believes in Chriſt, believes the Goſpel, and believing that, he believes the Truth of it, and All it contains.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To believe in Chriſt is to truſt in, and depend on Him alone, for Salvation.</p>
            <p>HE alone can procure it, and it is only He that can be truſted in for it. Now this may imply—that we are fully ſatisfied and believe we can obtain Salvation only in, and by Chriſt—and alſo a full Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his being an able and allſufficient Savior.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT we believe and are fully ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied we can obtain Salvation only in, and by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>CHRIST is the only Mediator between God and Man—the Medium of Acceſs to Him, or Means of Reconciliation with Him. The Apoſtle Peter when he had
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:012709_0028_0F8B8E3A08BEC118"/>
cured the lame Man, and was brought before the Rulers on that Account, thus declares: † Be it known unto you all, and to all the People of Iſrael, that by the Name of Jeſus Chriſt of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raiſed from the Dead; even by Him doth this Man ſtand before you whole. This is the Stone which you Builders rejected, which is now become the Head of the Corner. Neither is there Salvation in any other: For there is none other Name under Heaven given among Men whereby we can be ſaved. The Favor of God being forfeited by Sin, Chriſt undertakes to make Atonement— to open a door whereby ſinful Men may draw nigh to God, have Hopes of Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Forgiveneſs and Acceptance. His Death was to expiate Guilt by making Satisfaction to divine Juſtice. Accordingly we read, "God laid upon Him the Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of us All—that we have Redemption through his Blood, even the Forgiveneſs
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:012709_0029_0F8B8E3AC7010F70"/>
of Sins." It was this only that obtained it, we being redeemed not with corruptible Things as of Silver and Gold, but with the precious Blood of Chriſt, as a Lamb without Blemiſh, and without Spot. To believe therefore in Chriſt is to be ſatisfied there is no other Way and deſire none.</p>
            <p>CHRISTIANITY, ſays Dr. Doddridge, is the Religion of Sinners, and it never will be really welcome to a Soul that is not ſenſible of the Malignity of Sin. Many of Mankind forget God, do not ſeek after him at all, will not have him to reign over them. But if their Conſciences be properly awakened, they muſt ſee their Dependence on him, and their Need of an Intereſt in his Favor: And as having juſtly offended, they want one to interpoſe for them. For having proper Notions of God, they are ſenſible that his Juſtice and Holineſs are eſſential to his Nature, as his Wiſdom and Goodneſs. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when they conſider themſelves as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:012709_0030_0F8B8E3B827355A8"/>
in his Preſence, guilty of the greateſt Crimes, they muſt be led to cry out, from a deep and inward Senſe, Who is able to ſtand before this holy Lord God? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhall I come before the Lord, and bow myſelf before the high God? Surely I need ſome perfectly righteous Mediator, high in his Favor, to introduce me to him, and to render my Acceſs ſafe and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, by appearing as a Day's-Man betwixt us, to lay his Hand upon us both. And this thoſe who believe in Chriſt readily acknowledge, and heartily acquieſce in.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THEY have alſo a full Perſwaſion of his being an able and allſufficient Savior.</p>
            <p>THEY believe the truth of the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, "that he is able to ſave to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all that come unto God by him; ſeeing he ever lives making Interceſſion." They conſider him as appointed of God. That God has laid in Zion, for a Foundation, "a tried Stone, a precious Corner Stone, a
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:012709_0031_0F8B8E3CA3FB0F40"/>
ſure Foundation." That God is infinitely wiſe and good, knows what are the beſt Means, moſt adapted to anſwer Ends; and that whatever he determines to be beſt, they may undoubtedly rely on. They conſider his Character, as the Son of God, and the Manner of his Appearance. That it was neceſſary He ſhould take Fleſh upon Him; and that ſuch an high Prieſt became Men, who was holy, harmleſs, undefiled and ſeparate from Sinners. And They view Him as accepted of God—that He was an Offering and Sacrifice to Him for a ſweet ſmelling Savor. Being therefore convinced of theſe Thins, they do accordingly truſt in, and depend upon Him for Salvation. "Heartily conſent to own and accept Him in the Characters He bears; and have their Spirits impreſſed ſuitably to the Nature and Importance of what they aſſent to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Him. As He is the only Savior of Sinners, ſet forth in the Goſpel for a Propitiation; through whom Pardon and
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:012709_0032_0F8B8E3ED2EAD1B8"/>
Acceptance with God may be had; and as He is ſufficient therefor: So their Belief of theſe is attended with the committing of themſelves to Him, to be ſaved in His own Way, and a firm reliance upon Him as able and willing to perform all the kind Offices for them which are included in the Character of a Savior."</p>
            <p n="3">3. FAITH in Chriſt is productive of new Obedience.</p>
            <p>THIS will ever be exerciſed by thoſe who believe in Jeſus, and whenever this Obedience is wanting, Mankind may aſſure themſelves, they are miſtaken, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their Pretences.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE was it, that the Apoſtle directs Titus (that his Hearers might not be deceived in ſo important a Matter) <note n="*" place="bottom">Titus III. 8.</note> "to affirm it (not tranſiently but) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, that they who have believed in
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:012709_0033_0F8B8E3F4AE34AE0"/>
God be careful to maintain good Works." He ſuppoſed this muſt be ſo, if they had true Belief. And thus is it elſewhere repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. Thus, <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. X. 16.</note> But they have not all obeyed the Goſpel, for Eſaias ſaith, who hath believed our Report? <note n="‖" place="bottom">Heb. V. 9.</note> Chriſt is the Author of eternal Salvation to them that obey Him. The Apoſtle Paul was ſent to the Gentiles <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts XXVI. 18.</note> to open their Eyes and to turn them from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God, that they might receive Forgiveneſs of Sins, and an Inheritance among them which are ſanctified by FAITH that is in Him. And put no Difference between us and them, purifying their Hearts by Faith.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Acts XV. 5.</note>
            </p>
            <p>FAITH, REPENTANCE, CHRISTIAN OBEDIENCES, HOLINESS, LIKENESS to God, &amp;c. though variouſly expreſſed, are but one and the ſame Thing. There can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be one without the other. He who truly and properly believes in Chriſt, does
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:012709_0034_0F8B8E4179F4EA00"/>
ſincerely repent of his Sins, and if there is Time for it, heartily endeavors by the Grace of God to render an Obedience to all His Precepts.</p>
            <p>AND I find it obſerved by Writers on the Subject of Faith, that where it is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as a Condition of Salvation, it denotes not only a naked Aſſent to the Truth of this Propoſition; that He is the Son of God, and the Meſſenger of God's Mind and Will to the World, and the Savior of Sinners; but that it includes alſo whatever is naturally conſequent thereunto. For thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſay they, it is very ordinary with the Scripture to expreſs the natural Effects and Conſequences by their Cauſes. This is the Love of God, ſays the Apoſtle John,<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Epiſt. V. 3.</note> that we keep his Commandments. Whereas in Strictneſs of ſpeaking, our keeping His Commandments, is only the Effect or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of loving Him. So ſays the wiſe Man.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Prov. VIII. 13.</note> The Fear of the Lord is to hate
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:012709_0035_0F8B8E41A37558C8"/>
Evil, whereas indeed this is only the Effect or Conſequence of the Fear of the Lord. And thus by knowing, and hearing, and remembring of God; the Scripture uſually expreſſes the conſequent Effects of them. And ſo alſo Faith or believing, when it is uſed as connected with eternal Life, muſt always imply it's natural Effects and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents: i. e. ſincere and univerſal Obedience to thoſe Rules of holy Living which the Goſpel preſcribes: For this is the moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Effect of our believing in Jeſus Chriſt. <note n="*" place="bottom">1 John V. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> Whoſoever believes that Jeſus is the Chriſt is born of God, i. e. whoſoever ſo believes the Truth of this Propoſition as to practiſe upon it, and govern his Life and Actions according to the Tenor and Direction of it, is truly a Child of God. For he who believes Chriſt to be the Meſſias, but continues obſtinately diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to his Laws, is ſo far from being a Child of God, that he thereby becomes ten Times more a Child of the Devil. For,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:012709_0036_0F8B8E42434C0E20"/>
ſays the Apoſtle Paul, <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Cor. XIII. 2.</note> If I have all Faith and have not Charity, I am Nothing. For, ſays he again, <note n="‡" place="bottom">Gal. V. 6.</note> For in Chriſt Jeſus neither Circumciſion availeth any Thing or Uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, but Faith which worketh by Love. And what he means by this, he tells us, Gal. VII. 16. Circumciſion is Nothing and Uncircumciſion is Nothing but the new Creature. And what he means by this, he tells us, 1 Cor. VII. 9. Circumciſion is Nothing and Uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion is Nothing but keeping the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God. So that the only Thing which is genuine and will be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is Faith working by Love. Faith working by Love is the new Creature, and the new Creature is keeping the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God.</p>
            <p>THIS then may ſerve to correct the Miſtakes of thoſe who place the whole of ſaving Faith upon a bare Dependance on Chriſt for Salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:012709_0037_0F8B8E43C0F7A288"/>HOW many are there that have, and will have no other Conception of it? And it is to be feared, flatter themſelves to their Ruin and Deſtruction. This is a Part, and but a Part; was it the whole, would be diſhonorable to God, defeat the Deſign of Chriſt's Coming; and be ſubverſive of all Holineſs and Goodneſs. There can be no true Faith in Chriſt without believing in His Goſpel, and in His whole Character as therein repreſented; ſo neither can there be this, without an Obedience to His Injunctions. They are joined in the Word of Truth. We have no Right to ſeparate them.</p>
            <p>AND this may ſerve alſo to correct the Miſtakes of thoſe who think they have no true Faith, becauſe they are not certain of their Salvation.</p>
            <p>THIS is a Miſtake that ſome Chriſtians run into, "That they don't believe to any ſaving Purpoſe 'till they believe their own
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:012709_0038_0F8B8E45F175CDE0"/>
particular Salvation." Hence ariſe Fears and Diſtreſſes, their Lives are rendered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable, being ſubject to Bondage. Becauſe they cannot find Perfection in themſelves, they are not certain, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not believe aright. Certainty in this Life is not (ordinarily) to be expected. Such are our Situation and Circumſtances here, ſuch our Liableneſs to tranſgreſs; and the Temptations we are expoſed to; that we are to fear in ſome Degree; have a godly Jealouſy over ourſelves. The Apoſtle Paul, as good as he was, cries out, <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. VII. 24.</note> "O wretched Man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the Body of this Death." Tho' he ſays, he <note n="†" place="bottom">Ver. 22.</note> "delighted in the Law of the Lord after the inward Man." The Apoſtle John tells us, <note n="‖" place="bottom">1 Epiſt. III. 21.</note> "If our Heart condemn us not, then may we have Confidence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God." If our Aim in the Main is right, and we endeavor to approve ourſelves to God, we may have Hope; and if we have that, we nay be encouraged that we
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:012709_0039_0F8B8E4654929230"/>
believe aright, though Certainty does not take Place. And we ought to guard againſt the contrary Conception.</p>
            <p>LET us then endeavor after right Notions and Apprehenſions of Faith.</p>
            <p>A MISTAKE in this Matter may have an unhappy Tendency, prove of fatal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. Let us look to Jeſus; believe in Him as the Way, the Truth and Life; truſt in and rely upon Him as the only Savior of Sinners; and endeavor that we alſo do the Things which He ſays—Believe His Doctrines, and obey His Precepts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that He has told us, "that if we keep His Commandments, we ſhall abide in His Love—that we are His Friends if we do whatſoever He has commanded us, and that not every one that ſaith unto Him, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but He that doeth the Will of His Father who is in Heaven."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:012709_0040_0F8B8E4708C76FC0"/>THINK how inconſiſtent it muſt be, to profeſs to believe in, and yet in Works to deny Him: That this muſt be unworthy our Character, and end in Miſery. Be ſenſible that of ourſelves we can do No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that our Sufficiency is of God, that Faith is His Gift, let us be earneſtly ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for it, in the way He has appointed. Endeavor to "be continually building our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up in our moſt holy Faith;" grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to Him in all Things who is the Head; making our Calling and Election ſure, that our Hope may be more enlarged, ſtrengthened and confirmed. So ſhall we go on our Way rejoicing, be able to confide in the Mercy of God, and be finally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived there, where our Faith ſhall be ſwallowed up in Viſion, and our Hope in Fruition.</p>
            <p>WE come now to the</p>
            <p n="2">2d PARTICULAR under this OBSER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VATION. To evince the Truth of it, or ſhew that Something muſt be done in order to our being ſaved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:012709_0041_0F8B8E4786256128"/>HERE may enquire, why Something muſt be done? which will guard againſt Miſtakes, and evidence it to us.</p>
            <p>NOW certainly Nothing is expected and required, becauſe by our doing it, we can merit and purchaſe Salvation. We are Sinners, and have loſt the Favor of God. If therefore we are ſaved, we muſt owe it to His free and rich Grace and Mercy in Jeſus Chriſt. Chriſt's Death is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a Sinners Acceptance. <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. iii. 11.</note> "Other Foundation can no man lay, than that which is laid, which is Jeſus Chriſt." We are therefore accepted in the Son of God. Juſtified freely by His Grace through the Redemption there is in Jeſus Chriſt: and therefore not for any Works of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which we have done, but of His Mercy He ſaves us.</p>
            <p>AND here it is obſerved, and that juſtly, we are to fix our Hopes of Juſtification and
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:012709_0042_0F8B8E4845BE9C90"/>
Salvation, viz. on that perfect Propitiation and Satisfaction which Chriſt by the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Himſelf once offered, hath made for the Sins of Men. For the alone Merit of this Sacrifice God is graciouſly pleaſed to forgive us all our Sins. So that through Faith in the Blood of Chriſt, and not by Confidence in ourſelves, and our own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, we obtain Remiſſion of Sins and eternal Life. And it is not only in itſelf great Arrogance, but great Ingratitude to our bleſſed Redeemer, who gave Himſelf for us; to aſcribe that to the Merit of our Righteouſneſs, which nothing in Heaven or Earth, but the Blood of Chriſt could have purchaſed for us. Whatever we give God is his own; and when we have done all we can, it is but our Duty, and we muſt acknowledge we have fell ſhort; and that we are but unprofitable Servants. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing therefore is not required of us on this Account. This being premiſed, we proceed to ſay,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:012709_0043_0F8B8E4919FAAE38"/>IT is incumbent on us to be active in the Affair of Salvation, in Reference to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to Religion; and as an eſſential Diſtinction of Character is connected with it.</p>
            <p>SALVATION is offered to Sinners, yet none may expect it without they believe in Chriſt, repent of Sin, and return to God. It is the repenting, returning Sinner that is encouraged, and who only can hope to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Favor. Therefore are Sinners directed to ſeek the Lord while He may be found, to call upon Him while He is near; to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their Thoughts and return to Him; and are told He will have Mercy on them, and abundantly pardon them. So our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord while on Earth gives this kind Invitation: <note n="†" place="bottom">John VII. 37.</note> "If any Man thirſt, let him come unto Me and drink." And He ſays alſo: <note n="‡" place="bottom">Matt. XI. 28, 29.</note> "Come unto Me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you reſt. Take my Yoke upon you and learn of Me, and ye ſhall find Reſt to your Souls." This it ſeems muſt be done if they experienced
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:012709_0044_0F8B8E49CAA7B4F8"/>
Bleſſings from Him; and implies, that they would not have, and could not expect them without. And this He elſewhere declares fully. For He ſays, <note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. XXIII. 37.</note> "How often would I have gathered thy Children together as a Hen gathereth her Chickens, and ye would not; therefore your Houſe is left to you deſolate,." <note n="†" place="bottom">John V. 40.</note> "And ye will not come to Me that ye might have Life." And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore becauſe they did not come, they were not to have it, and which they would, had they complied.</p>
            <p>IF no Attention is to be paid to the Temper and Behavior of Men, it would matter not what were their Character; they need not be ſollicitous how they conducted; it might be as well to be wicked, in this view, as to be virtuous.</p>
            <p>BUT it may be ſaid, if there were no Heaven or Hell hereafter, it would be beſt for Men to be good. Be it ſo. But the Queſtion is, whether they would be? Do
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:012709_0045_0F8B93CD5C9352A8"/>
we not, conſidering our Make and Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, want Something by Way of Motive; and is it not the Hope of Happineſs or Good ariſing, that actuates Men in all their Conduct? It is interwoven in our very Natures, and 'tis impoſſible almoſt, to act abſtractedly from it. And the Motive of preſent-Good only, would perhaps be hardly ſufficient.</p>
            <p>WE are ſurrounded with many Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and we ſtrongly incline and liſten to them; and we ſhould undoubtedly give way, were it not for the Motives of future Happineſs ſet before us in the Goſpel. We ſee, powerful as they are, they are not always ſufficient; and what would be the Caſe if there were none. If therefore it matters not whether Men conduct diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently: No good comes of their Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and Self-Denials, their Labors and Endeavors, why ſhould they be at the Pains? They Might ſay as the Epicurean, in Regard to Futurity, "Let us eat and
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:012709_0046_0F8B93CE19A11C88"/>
drink for To-morrow we die." Let us take Life while we have it. We are as well and ſhall ſtand as fair, as thoſe who are endeavoring to fear God and keep His Commandments. What Encouragement would here be to Vice? What Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to Virtue?</p>
            <p>BUT how different is this from the Reality? How ſtrongly are Men exhorted and encouraged to forſake ſin and live to God? "Repent and turn from your evil Ways, ſo Iniquity ſhall not prove your Ruin." "Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved." And how ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly are Men threatned, when purſuing the contrary Conduct?—"That if they will not repent, they ſhall be deſtroyed," "That he that believeth not is condemned already. He that believeth not the Son ſhall not ſee Life, but the Wrath of God abideth on him."</p>
            <p>IT is alſo incumbent on us to be active in the Affair of our Salvation, in Reference to the Rule of final Judgment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:012709_0047_0F8B93CEC2085ED8"/>THAT there will be a Day of Judgment, muſt be evident to us from our own Make and Conſtitution. Man has a Spirit formed within him, ſomething that directs him, whoſe Faculties are capacious, and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for Continuance. He is capable of forming proper Judgment of Things, and knowing the Nature of Actions; of recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting and reviewing Things paſt, and looking forward in ſome Meaſure to thoſe that are future, their Effects and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. He muſt therefore be accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and was deſigned to be judged.</p>
            <p>THE Force and Apprehenſions of our Conſciences prove it to us. The Uneaſineſs or Pleaſure ariſing from the Commiſſion of a good or bad Action, and this when Actions are ſecreted from the Knowledge of all Mankind; and which muſt be owing to a ſecret Foreboding or Preſage, that they muſt hereafter account for the Sin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:012709_0048_0F8B93D0F8EC0198"/>THE Diſpenſations of Providence. The unequal Diſtribution of Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments. And the Revelation God has afforded, do alſo fully point it out. It is declared, "That Men are once to die, and after Death the Judgment—That God has appointed a Day in which he will judge the World in Righteouſneſs, by that Man whom He hath ordained; whereof He hath given Aſſurance unto all Men, in that He hath raiſed Him from the Dead."</p>
            <p>IF then there is to be this Judgment, there muſt be ſome Rule, by which God will proceed in the final Determination. Now the Apoſtle Paul declares, <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. I. 16.</note> "that God will judge the Secrets of Men by Chriſt Jeſus according to the Goſpel." The Goſpel of Chriſt then is the Rule whereby Men are to be judged. And that declares,<note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. II. 6—11.</note> "that God will render to every Man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Deeds; to them who by patient Continuance in Well-doing, ſeek
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:012709_0049_0F8B93D12A9D1E60"/>
for Glory and Honor and Immortality; eternal Life: But unto them that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious, and do not obey the Truth, but obey Unrighteouſneſs; Indignation and Wrath; Tribulation and Anguiſh upon every Soul of Man that doeth Evil, of the Jew firſt, and alſo of the Gentile: But Glory, Honor, and Peace, to every Man that worketh Good, to the Jew firſt, and alſo to the Gentile: For there is no Reſpect of Perſons with God."</p>
            <p>GOD beſtows temporal Bleſſings when and where he pleaſes. He cauſes it to rain upon one city and not on another; favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Men with outward Proſperity, and cauſing Adverſity to be the Lot of others. He is not accountable herein; He has a right to beſtow his Favors and Bleſſings as He ſees fit.</p>
            <p>BUT now in judging Men in order to reward or puniſh, He acts differently. He views their Character and State; the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:012709_0050_0F8B93D1C2B2CFA8"/>
they have had, and the Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages they have labored under. He acts by the moſt conſummate Wiſdom and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Juſtice, not by capricious or arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power. Every Man muſt receive according to the Things done in the Body. God we ſee, it is ſaid by the Apoſtle, is no Reſpecter of Perſons. He that hath ſinned without Law, ſhall periſh without Law; and he that hath ſinned in the Law, ſhall be judged by it. If we ſuppoſe otherwiſe, we overthrow our natural Notions of Him, and indeed all Revelation. It therefore cannot be.</p>
            <p>TO whom then much is given—much is required—much is expected; and to whom little is given, the one Talent; if that is properly improved, no more is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. And herein the infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God are manifeſted; that He deals with Men as He has capacitated them, afforded them Knowledge; and as they have improved. i. e. He deals with
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:012709_0051_0F8B93D2A6F92858"/>
them as rational, accountable Creatures, and will reward them as ſuch. Somewhat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be done in order to his finally proceeding with them.</p>
            <p>AND this is requiſite in Reference to the divine Authority and Perfections.</p>
            <p>THERE is a Harmony of the divine Attributes in the Salvation of Men. They all act in Concert in this grand Affair. One is not exerted at the Expence of the other, but All unite. But now, were there No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be done by Men, Infinite Wiſdom would be called in Queſtion. The divine Purity and Holineſs would be taxed: The infinite Truth and Faithfulneſs would be doubted.</p>
            <p>THE Wiſdom of God is conſpicuous in contriving ſuch an Expedient as He has, to reconcile the divine Juſtice and Mercy together, when our Iniquities had ſet them at Variance. He has ſo diſpoſed all Things
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:012709_0052_0F8B93D3558EFF48"/>
as that they muſt ultimately redound to his Glory and the Good of Men. "Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in He hath abounded in all Wiſdom and Prudence:" but certainly this would not appear, it muſt defeat itſelf, if Men might be indulged in Sloth and Negligence; and would be ſubverſive of their Happineſs.</p>
            <p>GOD is Holy. Holineſs is eſſential to his Nature. To deſtroy Sin and make Men like to Him, He ſent his Son. And 'till that Image which has been deſtroyed by Sin is renewed, Men are incapable of the Enjoyment of Him. But might they be idle and careleſs, would it not appear as though God was indifferent about it, or connived at it? <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm L. 21.</note> "Thou thoughteſt I was altogether ſuch an one as thyſelf: But I will reprove thee."</p>
            <p>SUCH is the Juſtice of God, that He ſeverely animadverts on thoſe who tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs his Laws; and He muſt govern All
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:012709_0053_0F8B93D4183DE308"/>
with the greateſt Impartiality. He has declared that He will. And his Ways and Judgments are true and righteous. "He will puniſh the World for their Evil, and the Wicked for their Iniquity. The righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Lord loveth Righteouſneſs, and his Countenance doth behold the Upright." And therefore it muſt be neceſſary, if we believe this, to endeavor to forſake Sin and live to God. If we think otherwiſe, how can we ſuppoſe God to be indeed as He is deſcribed?</p>
            <p>GOD muſt be an all-perfect Being: poſſeſſed of abſolute Rectitude. Every Perfection muſt agree. Did they not, He would ſink in his Character, and of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence ceaſe to be God. So that, upon the whole, the Truth of the Obſervation muſt appear. We have Nothing to do by Way of Merit and Claim, but Something muſt be done in the Way of Duty, as we are intelligent, accountable Creatures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="unknown:012709_0054_0F8B93D522E0B218"/>WE may therefore adore and praiſe that Being who has thus conducted. The Method He has appointed is conſiſtent with his moral Government, and the State of Men as fallen, but as rational—As under Obligations to improve their Faculties, to ſerve and obey Him. In this Way his Grace is honored. There is Nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with his Perfections, and no En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement is given to the Corruption or Inactivity of Man. We are therefore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence his Name and render Him Thanks.</p>
            <p>WE alſo ſee that it is not for us to ſtand ſtill and expect Salvation.</p>
            <p>GOD we find expects and requires Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of us; He has therefore given Means for our Improvement. They are admirably adapted to the Purpoſe, and it is ordinarily in the Uſe of theſe that He meets with Men, bleſſes and enables them to believe to the ſaving of their Souls. If they reject them, they can have no Reaſon to expect God
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:012709_0055_0F8B93D5A0D380E0"/>
will appear for them, but that they muſt be given over to Blindneſs of Mind, and Hardneſs of Heart, and die in their Sins.</p>
            <p>AND whatever Men in Health, and while engaged in the World, may think, yet it is certain, when they come to quit the Scene, and Eternity opens to their View, their Conceptions in the general are different. I believe it is ſeldom that one goes out of the World, if he has his Senſes, but blames Himſelf for not doing more than he has: Either that he has not prayed to God at all, or not enough, or that he has not attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on his Worſhip and Ordinances, or not with that Devotion and Sincerity he ought. But why ſhould Men, when going out of Life, diſtreſs themſelves with theſe Things, if they were needleſs, if it mattered not whether they were done; and were of no Conſequence to Salvation and Happineſs? The Mind of Man thus miſgiving is a ſtrong Evidence that we ought to be work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out our Salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="unknown:012709_0056_0F8B93D99FE42770"/>MEN therefore are not to be inactive. If they perſwade themſelves that they may, and their Lives are agreeable to this Perſwaſion, they are undone, and that forever.</p>
            <p>GOD has been pleaſed to ſend his Son into the World to die: Salvation is to be ſought for only through Him. A Man muſt then labor earneſtly after it. And though his Diligence is not the Ground and Foundation of his Acceptance with God, as I have ſaid, and do always preach, yet or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily Nothing will avail without.</p>
            <p>LET thoſe then who have Ground to hope, they know and believe in the only true God and in his beloved Son, ſee that they endeavor to grow in Grace and in the Knowledge of Chriſt. To this End they ſhould often reflect on future unſeen Things. Knowing that "Faith is the Subſtance of Things hoped for, and the Evidence of Things not ſeen:" and labor to have their
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:012709_0057_0F8B93DA62924010"/>
Souls more affected with them than with the Vanities of the World. They ſhould be much in Prayer to God for the Aſſiſtances of his Spirit, not be aſhamed to own their Weakneſs; but be diligently ſeeking for that Strength they need. By this Means they will be making conſtant Advances in Religion. The Evidences of their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Happineſs will be ſtronger and clearer. Their Difficulties will leſſen. They will find God "a Sun and a Shield, and that He will withhold no good Thing from them."</p>
            <p>LET thoſe who are yet in their Sins, be excited to throw off their Sluggiſhneſs. Be not diſcouraged from the Difficulty of the Work. Conſider God's Grace is all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, and that He is ready to afford it, if you ſincerely and heartily deſire it. Think not that the ſecuring the Happineſs of your immortal Souls is the Buſineſs of a Minute, an Hour or Day; but muſt be the Work of your Lives. That is little
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:012709_0058_0F8B93DAB9F56ED0"/>
enough, and yet enough if improved aright. Cry to Him therefore for his Grace, that ye be not Deſpiſers of the Salvation offered, and made known in the Goſpel; and ſo eſcape the Puniſhment threatned therein, and which will be inflicted on thoſe who muſt in the great Day be judged by, and have rejected it. You have every Thing to invite you. O then "take hold of God's Strength and eternal Life is before you."</p>
            <p>THE THIRD AND LAST OBSERVA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION I make from the Words is, That our Salvation is what above all Things we ought to be concerned for.</p>
            <p>HERE I ſhall endeavor to ſhow—When we may be ſaid to be above all Things concerned for our Salvation—and then why we ſhould be thus concerned.</p>
            <p n="1">1. WHEN we may be ſaid to be above all Things concerned for our Salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="unknown:012709_0059_0F8B93DB85205508"/>NOW this is ſo when it dwells moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently upon the Mind, we give the greateſt Attention to, are chiefly inquiſitive about it, and prefer it to every Thing elſe.</p>
            <p>MAN is a compound Being, conſiſting of Soul and Body; and as the Natures of each are different, ſo are their Deſires and Aims. He is poſſeſſed of the Faculty of collecting in ſome Meaſure his Thoughts, and governing his Imagination, fixing the Mind upon thoſe Things that will enoble and profit Him; and anſwer the End of his Being. For as ſoon as Men give way to Thoughtleſſneſs, and Vice is predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, they forget the Deſign of their Being —what they are—what they were made for; and put themſelves upon an Equality with the brutal Creation.</p>
            <p>NOW proper Attention to any Thing is an Application of Mind, according to it's Nature and Importance, thereby to become acquainted with, and have clearer
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:012709_0060_0F8B93DDB2836D50"/>
Apprehenſions of it. And when Men are ſollicitous about their Salvation, they will endeavor rightly to conſider, ponder and weigh it with the utmoſt Impartiality, that thereby they may ſecure it, their Lives be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come duly influenced; and they may act in Conformity to that, to which it would perſwade them. Man being a rational thinking Creature, is to be principally go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by his Thoughts; and they will be engaged in thoſe Things he has the ſtrongeſt Inclination to, and takes the greateſt Satisfaction in. And if Men are made ſenſible of the great Worth and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of Salvation, they will be moſt thoughtful and inquiſitive concerning it.</p>
            <p>THIS will lead them to be afraid of miſſing it, to guard againſt thoſe Things that will endanger, and to purſue thoſe that will tend to further and promote it.</p>
            <p>SALVATION is a great Thing, not ſo eaſy a Matter as Many may imagine it to be.
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:012709_0061_0F8B93DE1AED14E8"/>
Our Lord tells us, <note n="†" place="bottom">Matth. VII. 14.</note> "Wide is the Gate, and broad is the Way that leadeth to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and Many there be that go in thereat: Becauſe ſtrait is the Gate and narrow is the Way which leadeth unto Life, and Few there be that find it."</p>
            <p>WE have indwelling Luſt and Corruption to grapple with. A Law in our Members warring againſt the Law of our Minds, and bringing us into Captivity to the Law of Sin. We have certain Appetites and Paſſions implanted within us, which in themſelves are Good, but which are not always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained. They are capable of, and often are wrought upon and turned into different Courſes, and upon different Objects, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our Reaſon and the Word of God. It requires great Pains and Vigilance to keep them in due Subjection: And the breaking out and indulging them is the Grief of good Men, and is acknowledged by them. "The Good I would, ſays the
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:012709_0062_0F8B93DE7A8D5D58"/>
Apoſtle Paul, <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. VII. 19.</note> I do not, but the Evil which I would not, that I do." And All muſt find, that when they would do Good, Evil is preſent with them. This then is not an eaſy Thing. If we give way, ſuffer them to get the Aſcendancy, it is certain we cannot be ſaved; and to get the entire Maſtery over them, we ſhall find it difficult.</p>
            <p>WE are alſo expoſed to the Sollicitations of evil Spirits. They ſurround us with innumerable. Temptations, are inveterate Enemies that muſt conſtantly be oppoſed. Theſe the Scripture informs us were once holy and happy, but are now quite the reverſe. They rebelled againſt their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker and Sovereign, and were baniſhed the Regions of Light and Bliſs. Their Pride is diſappointed, and they induſtriouſly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to deceive and ruin Man, who by the Grace of God may obtain that Happineſs which they can never expect. Agreeable to this is that of the Apoſtle Peter, <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Pet. V. 8.</note>
               <pb n="59" facs="unknown:012709_0063_0F8B93DF59475BF8"/>
Your Adverſary the Devil, as a roaring Lion, goeth about ſeeking whom he may devour. Now when Men have ſuch powerful and ſubtle Adverſaries, it requires great Reſolution and Stedfaſtneſs. "Whom reſiſt ſtedfaſt in the Faith;" the Expreſſion implies in it Difficulty: There is Need of great Circumſpection.</p>
            <p>AND Mankind are converſant with ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Objects. They are uſed to Senſe, and readily follow it's Perceptions. The Objects preſent themſelves, and have a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing Force and Influence. And theſe they ſee. But it is not thus with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Salvation. That is Spiritual and is at a Diſtance; is principally to be enjoyed hereafter. We are therefore apt to "look at the Things which are ſeen, but not at the Things which are not ſeen; for the Things which are ſeen are temporal, but the Things which are not ſeen are eternal."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="unknown:012709_0064_0F8B93E003736088"/>AND then if we conſider how extenſive and univerſal is our Duty, if we would be really religious; how much is included in, and will follow that Belief which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the Saving of our Souls: That every Action of Man is to be regarded; that "He that offends in one Point is guilty of All," it muſt be difficult. There would be no great Difficulty in being ſaved, if Men might indulge one Sin and diſcard the other, perform this Duty and neglect that. But this he is not, nor can be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. His Character muſt be uniform, and his Religion conſiſtent.</p>
            <p>NOW thoſe who are above all Things concerned for their Salvation, are ſenſible of this. It leads them to be on their Guard, and to endeavor their utmoſt, that they may not finally miſcarry.</p>
            <p>THEY labor to know themſelves, what are their prevailing Vices and Temptations, and to lay aſide every Weight and the Sin
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:012709_0065_0F8B93E507275C20"/>
that doth moſt eaſily beſet them, and to run with Patience the Race ſet before them. They are not ſlothful in the Work of God, but followers of them who through Faith and Patience inherit the Promiſes. They preſs on with all their Might, toward the Prize, toward that Heaven "which Chriſt has purchaſed for them by his Blood, which the Spirit of God prepares them for; and to which God inceſſantly calls and invites them."</p>
            <p>THEY endeavor to ſoar above the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſive Amuſements of a vain tranſitory World; and to think of another and better Happineſs.. It is but a little, it is true, that they know at preſent, but enough for their Encouragement; they keep it in their Eye, and it quickens them.</p>
            <p>THEY know they have their Duties and various Departments—that it is the Duty of All, the Work of every One, to take Care of his Soul, to be fitted for that
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:012709_0066_0F8B93E7387F7C58"/>
eternal Duration which remains for him after Death—that the Life they now live in this World is a Time of Exerciſe, a ſhort State of Trial and Probation, in order to a durable and endleſs State; in which they ſhall be fixed in another World—that they have their different Relations, were not born for themſelves, and are not to ſeek their own Things only, but every Man alſo the Things of others—conducting in ſuch a Manner, in whatever Station or wherever Providence has caſt their Lot, as ſhall be productive of the greateſt Advantage to thoſe around them.</p>
            <p>AND finally, having the higheſt Concern for their Salvation, they will readily part with all their Intereſt in this World, rather than forego their Intereſt in the other.</p>
            <p>THEY are fully ſenſible of, and believe what Chriſt has declared, <note n="*" place="bottom">Matth. X. 37.</note> that "He that loveth Father or Mother more than Him
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:012709_0067_0F8B93E8179F93B0"/>
is not worthy of Him, and he that loveth Son or Daughter more than Him is not worthy of Him; and he that taketh not his Croſs and followeth after Him is not worthy of Him—that they muſt have ſuch a conſtant Regard to the Salvation of their Souls, as ſhall prevail above all At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments to their deareſt Relations and moſt intimate Friends, to their own Eaſe and Comfort, and even to their Lives; as He has again declared, <note n="‖" place="bottom">Matth. X. 39.</note> that "Whoſoever will ſave his Life ſhall loſe it, and whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall loſe his Life for his Sake ſhall find it."</p>
            <p>AND this was indeed verified in the Apoſtles and primitive Chriſtians. They renounced All, underwent the greateſt Miſeries, ſubmitted to all Manner of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, hazarded their Lives, gave them up for the Sake of propagating that Religion, the Belief of which would ſave their Souls and thoſe of others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="unknown:012709_0068_0F8B93E844A82B50"/>THE Perſecutions againſt then were very ſevere, even by their own Friends and Countrymen. The Apoſtle Paul was at firſt exceedingly mad againſt them. He breathed out Slaughter, dragged them before the Sanhedrim and had them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. Herod vexed certain of the Church and killed James the Brother of John with the Sword; and he proceeded to take Peter alſo, and confined him in Priſon, with a View to kill him. And Paul himſelf and Silas were confined in Jail at the Time when the Queſtion in the Text was aſked them.</p>
            <p>WHEN the Goſpel was ſpread farther, general Perſecutions were raiſed againſt it. The Believers of it bore the heavieſt Load of Rage and Malice, being every where perſecuted by Baniſhment and Death, count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves happy, they were thought worthy to ſuffer. Bleſſed be God it is not ſo now. But yet Chriſtians that are above all Things ſollicitous for their Salvation,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:012709_0069_0F8B93E90EC53060"/>
rather than loſe it, would reſign up their Intereſts, ſubmit to the greateſt Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences; and even forfeit Life itſelf; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that "A Man is not profited if he ſhould gain the whole World and loſe his own Soul;" that there is Nothing he can give in Exchange for his Soul. I am to ſay,</p>
            <p n="2">2. WHY we ſhould be thus concerned.</p>
            <p>NOW in a Word—It is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for us—and there is Nothing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the like Notice and Attention.</p>
            <p>IT is abſolutely neceſſary. It is the One Thing needful. Neceſſary for All of every Age and Condition. Many Things are needful for us here and only here. We want Food, Raiment, &amp;c. and cannot do without them. But Salvation is above them all. This will enable Men to live in the true Senſe in this World, and to live forever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="unknown:012709_0070_0F8B93E9C0237DF0"/>INDEED a good Man is ſaid to begin his Heaven on Earth, and to finiſh there what he began here. For the more his Corruptions are maſtered, and his Mind improved in the Things of Salvation, the more is he ſpiritualized, and made meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light. So, on the contrary, the more a Man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulges himſelf in Sin, and neglects Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the fitter he becomes for Hell, and the more deſerving of the Puniſhment of it.</p>
            <p>IF therefore Men would eſcape this, and go to Heaven when they die; they muſt ſee, they are ſavingly acquainted with Chriſt, have ſecured an Intereſt in Him who is the great Savior of Sinners; their Souls enlightened in the Knowledge of Him and ſanctified by his Grace.</p>
            <p>AND there is Nothing that is worthy the like Notice or Attention.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="unknown:012709_0071_0F8B93EAA11E64C0"/>A DESIRE of Good, of Happineſs, is implanted in the Conſtitution of human Nature; this All agree in, though they differ in the Thing itſelf and in the Means of obtaining it.</p>
            <p>NOW all temporal Happineſs is unſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory in it's Nature, and fleeting and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory. This is apt to engroſs the Faculties of the Soul, and by Reaſon of it's Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Imperfection it readily catches at it. But when gratified is diſappointed, and is ſtill to ſeek an Happineſs.</p>
            <p>BUT could it be found herein, yet our own Experience ſhews us, that every Thing here is of a tranſitory Nature, appears but a little while and then vaniſhes. Riches take to themſelves Wings and flee away. Friends leave us; They muſt ſubmit to the Stroke of Death. All the Enjoyments of Time and Senſe will have an End. And it is upon this Conſideration, (upon the Vanity, Uncertainty, and little Dependance
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:012709_0072_0F8B93EB3A0A7988"/>
there is to be had on Men and Things of the World) that we are exhorted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce our Dependance upon, and check that Satisfaction Men are apt to have in them. <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. CXLVI. 3, 4.</note> Put not your Truſt in Princes, nor in the Son of Man in whom there is no Help; his Breath goeth forth and he returneth to his Earth. <note n="‖" place="bottom">Col. III. 2.</note> Set your Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on Things above, not on Things on the Earth. <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. LXII. 10.</note> If Riches increaſe, ſet not your Hearts upon them. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Prov. XXVII. 24.</note> For Riches are not forever. But now if Salvation is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to us we ſhall enjoy an Happineſs ſuited to our Souls, and which ſhall know no End, but be growing, and increaſing through all Eternity. So that upon the whole, this is what above all Things we ought to be deſirous of and concerned for.</p>
            <p>IF it be then as has been ſaid, how few are there that are properly concerned for their Salvation?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="unknown:012709_0073_0F8B93EF39D5A230"/>MANY may not think of it at all. Others may admit it at Times, but do not perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere. Though their Attachment to Sin is not wholly ſufficient to exclude "at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent," yet great enough to prevent going any Lengths, and ſo of "finally" excluding it.</p>
            <p>THEY perhaps have ſet out with Warmth and Zeal, reſolutely bent upon forſaking Sin and living to God; but this has been but of ſhort Duration. Particular Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences may have affected them (as the Earthquake did the Jailor in the Text) and for a while they felt the Force of their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, but they have gradually abated; they become indifferent about their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, at leaſt to exerciſe that Diligence and Induſtry required; and a ſmall Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Temptation will make them give it up. They keep up the Appearance, but can turn themſelves into any Shape, when their Intereſt requires it; become fickle and inconſtant, and poſſeſſed of no Steadineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="unknown:012709_0074_0F8B93F007DA73C8"/>WE ſhould then be ſollicitous to think properly of this Matter, to guard againſt Deception, think of Salvation as it is, what is expected and required; and how unhappy muſt be our Situation without.</p>
            <p>SUFFER me then, to exhort you to embrace the Salvation made known and offered in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>THIS is tendered to All, to the greateſt Sinner as well as the leaſt. None may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair. However vile and wicked, however they may have deſpiſed the Riches of God's Goodneſs, Forbearance and Long-Suffering, yet if they have a Deſire to return, if they are willing to cloſe with Chriſt. accept his Offers, they ſhall aſſuredly be happy. Thus the Apoſtle Paul, after mentioning a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Vices, tells the Corinthians, "that ſuch were ſome of them," i. e. they had practiſed ſuch Things. But, ſays he, "Ye are waſhed, ſanctified and juſtified in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and by the Spirit of your God."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="unknown:012709_0075_0F8B93F07A4315B8"/>NOT that a Commiſſion of thoſe Vices would recommend to the divine Favor, but they are mentioned to ſhew, that none may deſpair of the Grace and Mercy of God; that there is a Sufficiency in the Merits of Chriſt for the greateſt Sinners, if they believe in and obey Him.</p>
            <p>NONE thin can make any Objections. "Whoſoever will, let him come and take of the Water of Life freely. Ho, every one that thirſteth, come ye to the Waters, yea come buy Wine and Milk without Money and without Price." Look to Jeſus whom ye have pierced, and mourn; and let it be your chief Concern to ſecure an Intereſt in Him.</p>
            <p>THINK what God expects of thoſe to whom He has afforded great Knowledge. That we are they, who are favored with the Goſpel. <note n="†" place="bottom">Malachy IV. 2.</note> The Sun of Righteouſneſs hath ariſen upon us with Healing in his Wings." We have the greateſt and moſt
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:012709_0076_0F8B93F139306D38"/>
important Truths revealed—Our Inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency to ſave ourſelves, that God has provided Salvation, wherein He will be appeaſed and we juſtified. We have our Duty fully revealed, the Neceſſity of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, of a Change in Heart and Life— the Knowledge of the other World made known, it's Rewards and Puniſhments. We have the greateſt Advantages, Means of Grace afforded, frequent Opportunities of hearing the Word and being inſtructed in it. Some of us have publickly and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly owned ourſelves the Diſciples of Chriſt, and Him to be our Lord and Maſter; and have repeated Seaſons of renewing the Obligations we have laid ourſelves under. How highly are we favored? lifted to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in Point of Privileges—Privileges im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable to eternal Happineſs and Glory.</p>
            <p>AND now what muſt be the Conſequence of a Neglect? Can we plead Ignorance, that we are unacquainted with the Way to Life after having enjoyed ſuch diſtinguiſhing Favors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="unknown:012709_0077_0F8B93F21A2AFD68"/>SHALL we pleaſe ourſelves, that becauſe we have to eaſe our Conſciences performed ſome Parts of Religion, thoſe that are the leaſt oppoſite to our favorite Vices, that we ſhall eſcape; or that our Sentence ſhall be moderated, our Puniſhment leſſened? In vain are all ſuch Imaginations. In vain may we think of "gentle Flames:" Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation aggravated muſt be our Portion. Our Wilfulneſs will not be over-looked, our Miſery muſt be accumulated. What Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Perſons ought we then to be? how concerned that we reſt not in any Change, ſhort of one which is univerſal and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent.</p>
            <p>O LET us be excited to improve the Means of Grace and Salvation.</p>
            <p>PRAY to God daily and conſtantly thro' Chriſt. This is an Act wherein we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs our Dependance, that our Condition is imperfect; and that our Reliance muſt be
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:012709_0078_0F8B93F44FCA01E8"/>
on God For All we want. And as we have Time allotted for the public Worſhip and Service of God, we ought to embrace the Opportunities for our Attendance, not be abſent, let ſmall Things divert us from it. This no Doubt is a great, an happy Means of advancing the Honor and Glory of God, and promoting the Salvation of the Souls of Men, therefore it muſt be incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on All; Every Man is obliged by his Example to ſupport the Solemnity and Credit of it; and they contract Guilt who wilfully and cauſeleſsly neglect it.</p>
            <p>WE are favored with the Ordinances of God's Houſe, and it is neceſſary we improve them, and endeavor to anſwer their End.</p>
            <p>PARENTS ſhould give up their Children to God in Baptiſm, and when they do, they ought to underſtand it's Deſign and their Obligations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="unknown:012709_0079_0F8B93F518A1B5B8"/>AN Attendance on the other Ordinance is the Duty of Men. They are to ſee their Views and Deſigns are good, and labor to reap it's Benefit. When they conſider what glorious Things are intended, and therein preſented to their View, it ſhould inkindle a Flame of divine Love in their Souls, and excite them to make the moſt ſuitable Returns.</p>
            <p>IN a Word, we ſhould All humbly caſt ourſelves on the Mercy of God, and intreat Him for his Goodneſs Sake in Chriſt Jeſus to have Compaſſion on us, and by his Grace and Spirit "ſo to eſtabliſh our Hearts and direct our Ways, that having choſen the good Part, we may never relinquiſh it."</p>
            <p>AND thus have I finiſhed the Subject I have been ſome Time upon. I have not labored for a nice Arrangement of Words, for Poliſh or Ornament. My Deſign has been, with the greateſt Plainneſs, and I hope I can ſay, with Sincerity and Faithfulneſs,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:012709_0080_0F8B93F91BD07BC0"/>
to conſider the Importance of Salvation, the Method of it's Obtainment; and how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned we ſhould be above all Things to deſire and ſeek after it. God grant it may make ſuitable Impreſſion on All.</p>
            <p>MAY Saints be built up in their moſt holy Faith, and Sinners quickned in their Enquiry "what they ſhall do to be ſaved."</p>
            <p>O MAY we All endeavor in the ſeveral Places and Relations in which God has fixed us, to reſtore and increaſe vital Religion, promote it's Reputation by our countenanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. Then might we hope God would pour out his Spirit upon us and his Bleſſing. He would own us as His, give evident Tokens of his Favor; and receive us to dwell with Him for ever.</p>
