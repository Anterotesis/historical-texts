            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">1. WHat unthankfulneſs is this, to think ſo much upon two or three Croſſes, and to forget an hundred Bleſſings? What folly is it to darken &amp; ſtraiten our ſpirits, &amp; indiſpoſe our ſelves to the taking or doing of good? (2) A limb out of joynt can do nothing without deformity and pain.

The Oyl of Grace will bring forth the Oyl of Gladneſs. (4.) Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly perſons are in a perpetual darkneſs; all things ſeem black and dark unto them; their Souls are as it were died black; whatſoever comes to a melancholick perſon, comes in a dark way to the Soul.

We muſt neither bring ſin to, nor mingle ſin with our ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, for that will trouble the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit more than the trouble it ſelf. We are not hurt till our Souls be hurt. (7.) In ſudden encounters, ſome ſin doth many times diſcover it ſelf, the ſeed whereof lyeth hid in our hearts, which we think our ſelves free from. What cauſe have we then to fear continually that we are worſe than we take our ſelves to be? The force of Gun-powder is not known till ſome ſparks light on it. (8.) What a ſight were it to ſee the feet where the head is, or the earth where the heaven is? And to a ſpiritual eye, it ſeems as great a deformity, to ſee the Soul to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the rule of ſinful paſſions. (9.)

The way to expel wind out of your Body, is to take wholeſome nouriſhment; ſo to expel windy fancies from the Soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is to feed upon ſerious truths; our beſt way therefore, is to propound true objects to the mind, to work upon, As 1ſt. <hi>To conſider the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and goodneſs of God.</hi> 2ndly. <hi>The joyes of Heaven &amp; the torments of Hell.</hi> 3rdly. <hi>The last and strict Day of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</hi> 4thly. <hi>The vanity of Earthly Things.</hi> 5thly. <hi>The uncertainty of our Lives.</hi> (12.)

Happy is he that in his way to heaven meets with a chearful &amp; skilful Guide and Fellow-traveller, that carrieth Cordials with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all faintings of ſpirit. (17.) There is an heavy imputation on them that comforted not the weak: when men will not own others in trouble, but as the herd of Deer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake and puſh away the wounded from them. (18.) God often ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends comfort from us, to make uſe of our Chriſtian Friends, by whom he purpoſeth to do us good: often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the very opening of mens griefs, bringeth eaſe, without any further working upon them: The very opening of a vein cooleth the blood.

God defers, but in his deferring there is no empty ſpace, wherein no good is done: but there is in that ſpace a fitting for mercy. (39.) It is folly to think that we ſhould have Phyſick &amp; Health both at once; Gods time is the beſt time, reſolve therefore upon waiting His leiſure.

He that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abound without Pride &amp; High-mindedneſs, will never want with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out too much dejectedneſs. (42.) Let us not ſeek our ſelves abroad out of our ſelves, in the conceits of other men.

Thoſe whoſe condition is above their worth, and their pride above their condition, ſhall never want ſorrow; yet we muſt maintain our Authority in our places, for that is Gods, &amp; not ours and we ought to carry our ſelves ſo as we may approve our ſelves to their Conſciences, though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

(46) A man can be in no conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherein God is at a loſs; if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts be wanting, He can Create comforts, not only out of nothing, but even out of diſcomfort. He made the Whale which ſwallowed <hi>Jonas,</hi> a means to bring him to land. (47.) The only way to have our will, is to bring it to Gods Will. (48.)

his <hi>Fiat</hi> to Gods <hi>Fiat.</hi> (50.) None feel more experience of Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, than thoſe that are moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute in their Obedience. (51.) After we have given Glory to God, by relying upon his Wiſdom, Power, and Truth, we ſhall find Him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying theſe for our direction, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and bringing things about to our deſired iſſue; yea, above what we deſired or thought of. (52.) The more paſſion, the leſs diſcretion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe paſſion hinders the ſight of what is to be done, it clouds the Soul, and puts it on without adviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

Labour to fit a promiſe to every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition thou art in: there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition but hath a Promiſe ſuitable to it. (55.) He that loveth too much will grieve too much: It is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our affection that cauſeth the greatneſs of our affliction. (56.)

There is an art of bearing troubles (if we could learn it) without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver troubling our ſelves: as in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a burden there is a way to poize it, that it weigheth not over heavy, if it hangeth all on one ſide, it poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes the body down: the greateſt

part of our troubles we pull on our ſelves, by not parting our care, ſo as to take upon us onely the care of Duty, and leave the reſt to God. (58.) We muſt not mingle our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions with our croſſes, like fooliſh Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, chewing the Pills we ſhould ſwallow down. (59.) He that ſees not God every where, ſees him no where. (60.) He that loſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in ſelf-denial, finds himſelf in the boſome of God. (61.) In Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fear God, in Adverſity love God. [62.] Praying will make thee leave Sinning, or ſinning will make thee leave Praying. [63.] Our weakneſs and inabilities, break not the bond of our duties. [64.] No ſin but is eaſier kept out, than caſt out. [65.] What we are afraid to do before men, we ſhould be afraid to think before God. [66.] Nature vexed &amp;
