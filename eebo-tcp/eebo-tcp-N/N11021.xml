            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I SHALL begin this letter to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, with an extract of a letter I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed ſome time ſince to Lord Mansfield, becauſe I know how exactly your Lordſhip's capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city is fitted to think juſt as he thinks.</p>
            <p>To him obſerved;—to your Lordſhip I repeat it.—</p>
            <p>"That in matters of private property we ſee the ſame bias and inclination to depart from the deciſion of your predeceſſors, which you certainly
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:013971_0002_0F9259F40ADA4260"/>ought to receive, as evidence of common law; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of thoſe certain poſitive rules, by which the judgment of a court of law ſhould invariably be determined, you have fondly introduced your own unſettled notions of equity and ſubſtantial juſtice. Deciſions given upon ſuch principles, do not alarm the public ſo much as they ought, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the conſequence and tendency of each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtance is not obſerved, or regarded." But the day is now come, my Lord; the public have taken the alarm; your Lordſhip's lawleſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, in the court of Chancery, in the cauſe of Thickneſs and Liege, and the manner in which it was corruptly affirmed, in the Houſe of Lords, has ſhook the kingdom to its very baſis. Till that fatal day, my Lord, the ſupreme tribunal of this country ſtood un-impeached and un-polluted, as to matters of private property; but that was a day in which a deed was done, that even Lord Manſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field durſt not become a partiſan.</p>
            <p>That day, my Lord, was only a grievous day to the appellant, but it will prove a fatal blow to Britain.</p>
            <p>When the foundations of juſtice are ſo corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the firſt law officer in the kingdom ſhall dare to ſtand forth, in the higheſt court of judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, knowing that he has aſſiſtant judges, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ſupport him in reading letters containing the opinions of men not judges in that court, in order to affirm a decree unſupported by argument, and in direct contradiction to a former and recent judgment of that houſe, the day cannot be very remote, when the nation, the laws, and the violators of them will all be involved in one common ruin.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip is now brought to a greater tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal than even the Houſe of Lords,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="unknown:013971_0003_0F9259F4C2CE1420"/>
The Tribunal of the PUBLIC.</p>
            <p>You ſtand charged, my Lord, at that awful bar, with ſetting at defiance thoſe laws you were ſo ſhamefully appointed to ſupport, in order to affirm a wicked decree, without law to ſuſtain it, or an argument to give even a colour to ſhade it. You did it, my Lord, by the aſſiſtance of that Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſe Bully Lord Denbigh, who aſſaſinated juſtice, and ſtifled every idea of honor or humanity; till he had driven every honeſt man, but Lord Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, out of the Houſe! He, it is true, was not to be menaced from his duty by the groſſeſt lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, nor frightened from his poſt by the foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt fiend who ever appeared in human form.</p>
            <p>Are you not afraid, my Lord, to lie down in your bed, knowing, for you do know it, that you have ſacrificed a whole family to your vanity, and thereby ruined a gentleman, who has eight chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; the eldeſt of whom is next heir to a ſeat in that houſe you have ſo openly diſhonored, by plundering his father, and family, of their legal property.</p>
            <p>I have ſeen, my Lord, a copy of this gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's letter, written to his eldeſt ſon, now at Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braltar, the day after he was ſacrificed at the altar of miniſterial juſtice.</p>
            <p>In that pathetic letter, my Lord, the highly injured, and deeply afflicted father, after informing his ſon with the foul doings of your Lordſhip, and your wicked coadjutors, adds,</p>
            <p>"And now, my dear ſon, let me call upon you, as your affectionate father, and as your faithful friend (for be aſſured I am both) never to enter the Houſe of Lords, without caſting your eyes about you, and ſaying, in this houſe my father was
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:013971_0004_0F9259F5D43ACD70"/>defrauded of ten thouſand pounds; and if ever you ſhould be called to ſit in judgment there, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver take your ſeat in it, without looking up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and calling upon God, in a ſhort prayer, to enable you upon every occaſion to diveſt yourſelf of party zeal, all perſonal pique, all private reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo to enlighten your mind, and direct your heart, that in all you ſay or do, it may be conformable to that godlike precept of doing as you would be done by. If you do not this; then, to God, I offer up this my fervent prayer, that you may never have any voice where juſtice ought to be adminiſtered."</p>
            <p>Can your Lordſhip ſuſtain the horrid reflection of the deed you have done? Of that BLACK DAY'S WORK! Can the ſoothing gentle man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of that flattering low born
<note n="*" place="bottom">He is the ſon of an old cloaths man.</note> Perrin, or the ſmiles of your obſequious Regiſter, divert you from feeling the moſt pungent remorſe? Or do they, by telling you, how much they approve your decree, make your pliant mind eaſy? My Lord, I know they tell you ſo; but I will tell you, my Lord, that they durſt not ſay ſo to any lawyer.</p>
            <p>There is but one opinion among them, and that is (you ſhall hear it, my Lord, while Junius can hold a pen, and you the ſeals) that Lord Manſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field ſingled your Lordſhip out as a vain, weak, and wicked wretch to ſupport the ſame falſe, and unſettled doctrines in the Court of Chancery, which he has ſo long, and ſo ſhamefully practiſed in the Court of King's Bench; and which he has addreſs enough to give ſanction to, even without appearing in perſon, to appeals in the Houſe of Lords.</p>
            <p>When Lord Camden, with that gentleneſs of
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:013971_0005_0F9259F7DB2FCEF0"/>manners, which ever accompanies ſolid ſenſe, and unſhaken integrity, told your Lordſhip, that no man's opinion, however high his ſtation, or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever great his abilities, if not a judge in that court, could be produced or read, leaſt it ſhould influence any of the Lords in their judgments; you had the boldneſs to ſtand forth, and caſting down your hat, with which you ought to have hid your face, you perſiſted in reading Sir William De Grey's letter, becauſe your bully, Lord Denbigh, ſaid he would read another to the ſame purpoſe, if he had it.</p>
            <p>Sir William De Grey's letter was then read by your Lordſhip! His opinion, it ſeems, coincided with the Duke of Chandois's, Lord Denbigh's, and the two Scotch Lords, who ſat for Lord Mansfield.</p>
            <p>By theſe worthy Peers, my Lord, and two ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Biſhops, your Lordſhip's (I mean Sir William De Grey's) decree was affirmed without a diviſion!</p>
            <p>The week and feeble efforts of Lord Camden were overpowered by your Lordſhip's great abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and nobly ſuſtained by Lord Denbigh, and your other auxiliary troops.</p>
            <p>That Sir William De Grey's detection has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in him both ſhame and fear, is very obvious, for he never ſuſpected you would ſo openly publiſh his ſecret inſtructions, as his letter to the appellant, Thickneſs, will clearly evince; and I make no doubt if I can prevail upon your Lordſhip to attend to what the world thinks, and to underſtand what I ſay, you will be equally aſhamed; though I confeſs not equally criminal with Sir William De Grey. I ſay not equally criminal, my Lord, for God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid I ſhould think the crimes of ſo contemptible a wretch as your Lordſhip are equal to thoſe of a man as capable of torturing at once the laws,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:013971_0006_0F9259F887444290"/>and involving them, and a whole family, in one common ruin, as even Lord Mansfield himſelf.</p>

            <p>In a former paper (No. VII.) I gave your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip a copy of Sir William De Grey's firſt preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricating letter to the appellant, Thickneſs. On that letter I made but one comment. On this I ſhall, at preſent, make only one other. Either Sir William De Grey (I will not blot my paper with calling him a Chief-Juſtice) cannot ſupport Lord Mansfield's decree, and is aſhamed to repeat your Lordſhip's unmeaning jargon about ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive gifts, or he has received farther orders.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude this letter to your Lordſhip, by obſerving that there are ſtill a few people diſpoſed to think favorably of you, and to impute the black part of this tranſaction to Sir William De Grey; becauſe they confeſs the weakneſs of your head, and lament, as a national misfortune, that a man of ſuch contemptible abilities, as your Lordſhip's, and at ſuch a time too, ſhould diſgrace the Britiſh nation, in holding the higheſt law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment in it, without talents to acquit yourſelf with common decency, even in the loweſt; but
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:013971_0007_0F9259FD09AD2C40"/>ſome men are ſtill willing to hope your are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt.</p>
            <p>Now, my Lord, for their ſake, and for your own alſo, either anſwer the following queſtion fairly and openly, or for ever decline holding out lights to dazzel the world with falſe marks of your virtue or integrity. Would the ſelling a living, to Dr. Dodd, or his buying it of you, have been half ſo criminal as what you are now charged with?</p>
            <p>Did not your late deceaſed brother, Mr. Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min Bathurſt, keep his money, when he had any, at Meſſrs. Hoare's in Fleet-ſtreet? And did he not frequently over draw on that very reſpectable houſe? My Lord he did; you know he did; and did not you, his executor, when you ſettled the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and poſſeſſed his property, refuſe to allow that houſe a ſum of money your neceſſitous bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had over drawn upon it, under the ſhameful, ſhameful, did I ſay! under the infamous pretence, that they could not recover it, the time being lapſed!</p>
            <p>If this be true, my Lord, and facts you know are obſtinate things, the world will then be as fully ſatisfied about the rectitude of your heart, as they have always been about the extent of your genius. They will then be of one mind, as to your Lordſhip, whatever they think of JUNIUS.</p>
            <p>I never yet knew a man perfectly ſober, taking pains to convince every man he met, that he was ſo; but a drunken man is always acting the part of a ſober one; when you rung the alarm about Dr. Dodd, I violently ſuſpected you, and ſoberly ſet you down for the man all the world will now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you to be. And therefore I muſt repeat, what I ſaid before, the nation will no longer bear with you; your Lordſhip cannot, after ſuch foul pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, hold the great ſeal.</p>
            <p>

Cambyſes, King of Perſia, finding that his Chief Juſtice, Siſamnes, had pronounced an unjuſt ſentence, cauſed him to be executed and flayed, and with his ſkin covered the common ſeat of juſtice; then conſtituted Otanes, his ſon, judge in his room. He ſat, my Lord, upon his father's ſkin, which probably put him in mind of his own: And Perrin will make the application for your Lordſhip; and, if he be not aſhamed, remind your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the fate of the two time ſerving judges, Epſom and Dudley, who were hanged in the reign of Henry the Seventh. Of this tranſaction one of the greateſt lawyers, and moſt upright judge this nation ever was bleſt with, makes this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable epiphonema.</p>
