            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>§. 1. INtending to give you ſome DIRECTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ONS for your Proceeding in the STU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DIES, upon which you are Entring, that you may be prepared and furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Work of the Evangelical MINISTRY, to which you are deſigned; I ſhall not conſult the Method which any of the twice Twelve, <hi>Diſſertationes de Studiis,</hi> (Collected by <hi>Elzivir</hi> in one little Volum.) have given you. But the Contemplation of DEATH ſhall be the FIRST Point of the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> that my Advice muſt lead
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002772_0014_0FE62E6681977C68"/>you to. In the FIRST Place, <hi>My Son,</hi> I adviſe you to conſider yourſelf as a <hi>Dying Perſon,</hi> and one that muſt <hi>ſhortly put off this Earthly Tabernacle.</hi> I move you, I preſs you, To <hi>Remember how ſhort your Time is,</hi> yea, though it ſhould reach to the <hi>longeſt</hi> that is ordinarily known among the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men; and how much more <hi>ſhort</hi> it may be made for ought you know, in the <hi>Early Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipations</hi> of Mortality. Do this, that you may do nothing like <hi>Living in Vain.</hi> Place yourſelf in the <hi>Circumſtances</hi> of a <hi>Dying Perſon;</hi> your <hi>Breath</hi> failing, your <hi>Throat</hi> rattling, your <hi>Eyes</hi> with a dim Cloud, and your <hi>Hands</hi> with a damp Sweat upon them, and your Weeping Friends no longer able to retain you with them: And <hi>then</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch Sentiments of <hi>this World,</hi> and of the <hi>Work</hi> to be done in this World, that ſuch a <hi>View</hi> muſt needs inſpire you withal. Such a <hi>Numbring of your Days,</hi> I hope, will compel you to <hi>Apply your Heart unto Wiſdom;</hi> and Inſtruct and Excite you to ſpend your little TIME in ſuch Things, and ſo Induſtriouſly, as may be a Matter of <hi>Comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Reflection</hi> at the End of your Days. The <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion:</hi> of a <hi>Dying Perſon</hi> are uſually ſo Wiſe, and ſo much have the <hi>Right Thoughts of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> in them, that the beſt Counſel which can be given you, is, <hi>Child, Make haſte into them!</hi> It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>too ſoon</hi> to come into them. They will have a mighty Tendency to make you Serious, Diſcreet, and Induſtrious, and every way well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſed; and <hi>all that your beſt Friends would have you to be.</hi> You run the hazard of <hi>Dying without Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> if you delay to come into them; and <hi>pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002772_0014_0FE62E6681977C68"/>an <hi>Evil Day.</hi> It was not a Folly in ſome of the Ancients, to aſſign the <hi>Contemplation of Death,</hi> as the main Foundation, and main Exerciſe of their <hi>Philoſophy;</hi> And the <hi>Young Man</hi> will arrive to <hi>more Underſtanding than the Ancients;</hi> who does practice upon it. I propoſe a, <hi>Vive memor Mortis,</hi> as what will be the <hi>Way</hi> to the trueſt <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and no little <hi>Part</hi> of it; and as what will contribute as much as poſſible for any thing to do, unto a <hi>Wiſe Conduct</hi> in all your Affairs. May the THOUGHTS OF A DYING MAN come into an <hi>Early</hi> and <hi>Lively</hi> Conſideration with you, and regulate your Intentions, your Appetites, your Behaviours. My Propoſal is, That you would ſet apart <hi>proper Times,</hi> [And be ſure, The <hi>Preſent Time!</hi>] to think, <hi>What ſort of Life ſhall I moſt approve when I come to Dye! In what Work ſhall I moſt wiſh to have lived, when I ſee that I am to Dye? What Method and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Living ſhall I apprehend the moſt Eligible, when my Dying Hour is come upon me?</hi> Behold, What will <hi>give to the Young Man Knowledge and Diſcretion!</hi>

The Apprehenſion of <hi>Approaching DEATH,</hi> One would think, ſhould make you aſſoon as may be <hi>Begin to Live.</hi> But you do not <hi>Begin to Live,</hi> no, you are <hi>Dead while you Live,</hi> until you <hi>Live unto GOD.</hi> Methinks, I have already pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared you to conſider the Words which before I go any further, I ſhall tranſcribe for you, from a Treatiſe Entituled, <hi>The Angel of Betheſda,</hi> which is yet, [I may ſay, <hi>lying at the Pool,</hi>] un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publiſhed. <q>CHRISTIAN, Fill thy Life with moſt explicit <hi>Acknowledgements</hi> of the Glorious GOD, and Acts of <hi>Obedience</hi> to Him. Let even

At the ſame time, Fill thy Life with <hi>Good Offices</hi> to Mankind, and with <hi>Actions</hi> that ſhall be <hi>Bleſſings</hi> (and make the <hi>Doer</hi> a Rich One) unto thy Neighbours. This will be <hi>Living. — Caetera Mortis erunt.</hi> The Man who does the moſt of theſe things is the <hi>longeſt Liver.</hi> In <hi>Three Sevens</hi> of Years, One who lives at this rate may have a <hi>longer Life</hi> than a Drowſy and Thoughtleſs Wretch, that ſhould get along to <hi>Nine Hundred and Sixty Nine.</hi> I may make the more free with the Number in my Expreſſion on this Occaſion, becauſe the <hi>Jewiſh Rabbi</hi>'s venture to tell us, That the Time loſt by <hi>Methuſalah</hi> in Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Things, being defalked from his <hi>Nine Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Sixty Nine</hi> Years, he will have no more than <hi>Ten Years</hi> of <hi>True Life</hi> leſt unto him. It is a Maxim of Truth, <hi>Non Annu ſed Factis vivunt mortales.</hi> And, <hi>They have lived longeſt in the World, who have done the moſt Good in the World.</hi>
               </q> So my <hi>Angel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, <hi>My Son,</hi> though I began with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending to you the <hi>Thoughts of a Death at Hand;</hi> yet, what I mean, is, to make a <hi>long Live<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The true <hi>END of Life</hi> muſt therefore aſſoon as may be, come to be ſtated and fixed with you, and the <hi>falſe Ways</hi> of Sin be no longer walked in. And what can this END be, but, The SERVICE OF THE GLORIOUS GOD? Or, as you have been taught from your Infancy, TO GLO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIFY GOD AND ENJOY HIM FOREVER.

               </p>

               </p>
               <p>I apprehend every <hi>Act of Obedience</hi> to GOD, as a Thing which the Eye of that Infinite One does with Pleaſure take Notice of.</p>
               <p>That which procures any Act of <hi>my Obedience</hi> to be pleaſing unto the Infinite GOD, is the <hi>Mediation</hi> of my SAVIOUR. HE has by <hi>His Obedience</hi> to GOD for me, made <hi>Expiation</hi> for the Defects of <hi>my Obedience,</hi> and beſpoke a gracious Acceptance for it.

Yea, 'Tis more immediately to a Glorious CHRIST, and GOD ſhining upon me in <hi>Him,</hi> that I may pay my <hi>Obedience.</hi>

               <p>If I may in any Act of <hi>Obedience,</hi> or of <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,</hi> to the Will of GOD, be a <hi>Grateful Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle</hi> to HIM, or, if HE may take <hi>Satisfaction</hi> in what He helps me to <hi>Be,</hi> and to <hi>Do,</hi> before Him, This is the <hi>Higheſt Felicity</hi> I can wiſh for; the <hi>Top</hi> of my Ambition; the laſt END, the main and chief <hi>Scope,</hi> of my Life. <hi>Lord,</hi> Beyond This, there is nothing that I can <hi>Ask</hi> or <hi>Think.</hi>

            <p>I will conclude this Matter with the Words of One who knew what he Wrote. <q>Were a Man
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002772_0025_0FE62E92870D5410"/>able to write in <hi>ſeven Languages:</hi> Could he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe daily with the ſweets of all the <hi>Liberal Sciences,</hi> that Polite Men ordinarily pretend unto; Did he entertain himſelf with all the Ancient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Hiſtories: And could he feaſt continually on the <hi>Curioſities,</hi> which all ſorts of Learning may bring unto him; None of all this will afford the Raviſhing Satisfaction; much leſs would any groſſer Delights of the <hi>Senſes</hi> do it: which he might find in relieving the Diſtreſſes of a poor, mean, miſerable <hi>Neighbour;</hi> and which he might much more find in doing any <hi>Extenſive Service</hi> for the Kingdom of our Great SAVIOUR in the World, or any Thing to redreſs the Miſeries under which Mankind is generally Languiſhing.</q>
            </p>
            <p>§ 5. You are now in the Purſuit of that <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Ingenuous</hi> and <hi>Mollifying Arts,</hi> which which may diſtinguiſh you from the more <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated</hi> Part of Mankind, and may accompliſh you to claim a Place among them, who are the <hi>Bleſſings</hi> and <hi>Beauties</hi> of their Generation. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>This,</hi> what I do in the <hi>Firſt</hi> Place Adviſe you to, is, To fix the END of all your <hi>Studies,</hi> and let <hi>This</hi> be what it ought to be. Let <hi>Vives</hi>'s Motto, <hi>Oculus ad Scopum,</hi> have its Influence upon you in your whole Courſe of all your <hi>Studies.</hi> If you Aim no Higher nor Better, than to render yourſelf <hi>Conſiderable,</hi> and make a Figure among your Fellow-Mortals, or, perhaps, to gain a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Subſiſtence</hi> in the World, <hi>All</hi> you do is <hi>Wrong</hi> and <hi>Mean,</hi> and <hi>Vile,</hi> and the Holy GOD looks down with Abhorrence upon you. A <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> is not the only Chriſtian, who has had a
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:002772_0025_0FE62E92870D5410"/>true <hi>Sight</hi> of the <hi>Vanity,</hi> with which the Studies of the moſt that ſeek after Knowledge, are carried on, and pronounced thoſe the only <hi>Right Students, Qui ad hoc volunt Intelligere ut Benefaciant.</hi> I hope it would not be unintelligible unto you, if I ſhould recommend unto your Emulation, a Flight of One, who tho' I find him in the <hi>Curſed</hi> City, herein ſpoke like <hi>One of ours; Lord, I had rather, could it be without Sin, that all ſhould hate me, than that they ſhould Love me for myſelf: If all the World hate me, I ſhould have but what is mine; if they ſhould Love me for myſelf, they would uſurp what is Thine.</hi> But thus much I cannot but wiſh for; That you may <hi>betimes</hi> be inſpired with Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by which the <hi>Idol</hi> that has more Votaries than that on the Plain of <hi>Dura,</hi> that is to ſay, SELF, may be dethroned with you. Be aware of it, that the moſt of People who ſhall Honour you, and Admire you, and Applaud you, will Termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in <hi>you,</hi> and look no further than the <hi>Worm</hi> they look next upon: GOD will not have <hi>His Praiſes</hi> in what is done for you, and by you. GOD, without whom, and Before whom, you are as <hi>nothing,</hi> will not be <hi>Remembred;</hi> And all will be <hi>as nothing,</hi> in <hi>Remembrances</hi> of none but <hi>Aſhes.</hi> A <hi>Sacrilegious Idolatry</hi> will be committed! But a true Servant of GOD, will even deprecate it, as an <hi>Infelicity,</hi> to be made the Object of this <hi>Idolatry:</hi> And wiſh, <hi>Lord, Let thoſe that Fear thee,</hi> [and will ſee Thee thro' me,] <hi>be thoſe that ſhall turn unto me.</hi> The <hi>Love</hi> of GOD, muſt make you chuſe rather to be left <hi>unregarded</hi> in the World, than to have thoſe <hi>Regards</hi> paid unto you, wherein the Infinite GOD, the <hi>Firſt</hi> and the <hi>Laſt,</hi> ſhall be
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:002772_0026_0FE62E9FA2304608"/>Robb'd of <hi>His Glory,</hi> which He will not <hi>give unto another.</hi> Yea, Be prepared for <hi>Obſcurities,</hi> and for <hi>Indignities,</hi> and be Reconciled unto them upon this Account, <hi>I am now delivered from any Danger that the Robbers of GOD may make an Idol of me!</hi> But having thus forbidden you the <hi>Wrong</hi> ones, I will tell you, what is the RIGHT END unto which it were to be wiſhed, that your Studies may be Conſecrated.</p>
            <p>When you are upon ſeeking an Acquaintance with any <hi>Languages;</hi> Let your <hi>Aims</hi> be theſe. <hi>I Deſire to come at thoſe Treaſures, which theſe Tongues may be Keys unto; And this, that ſo I may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter furniſhed for that SERVICE OF GOD, which I may be called unto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When you are upon ſeeking an Acquaintance with any <hi>Sciences,</hi> Let your <hi>Aims</hi> be theſe; <hi>I De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to gain thoſe Illuminations which may be neceſſary for an Inſtrument of Good unto others; And this, that ſo I may be the better Qualified for that SERVICE OF GOD, which will require a Workman that need not be aſhamed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When you are upon <hi>Reading</hi> any <hi>Book,</hi> Let your <hi>Aims,</hi> for ever be of the ſame Importance.</p>
            <p>To Strengthen my Advice, I will tranſcribe ſome Words of the Celebrated Lord Chief Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice <hi>Hale;</hi> who in his <hi>Account of the Good Steward,</hi> ſays, <q>I carried along with me, in all my Studies, this <hi>Great Deſign,</hi> of improving them, and the Knowledge acquired by them, to the <hi>Honour</hi> of GOD's Name, and the greater Diſcovery of His <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> and ſo tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my <hi>Secular Learning</hi> into an Improvement
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:002772_0026_0FE62E9FA2304608"/>of <hi>Divine Knowledge.</hi> And had I not practiſed this Deſign in my Acquiſts of <hi>Humane Learning,</hi> I had concluded my <hi>Time miſpent;</hi> becauſe I ever thought it unworthy of a Man that had an <hi>Everlaſting Soul,</hi> to furniſh it only with ſuch <hi>Learning,</hi> as would either <hi>Dye with his Body,</hi> and ſo become un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Moment after Death</hi> would be attained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Labour or Toll in this Life.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus fixed the RIGHT END of your Studies, Let the View of it make ſuch an Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon you, as to produce a Marvellous <hi>Induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> in your Proſecution of it: And Quicken you to obſerve that Maxim, <hi>Do with thy Might, what thy Hand finds to do.</hi> Remember this; There ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was an <hi>Eminent,</hi> who was not an <hi>Induſtrious</hi> Man. You muſt be <hi>Diligent in your Buſineſs,</hi> if you would hope to <hi>ſtand</hi> in any Deſireable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances <hi>before</hi> that Great KING, unto whoſe Holy Service you are Dedicated.</p>
            <p>That you may not ſuffer a Vile <hi>Impediment in your Studies,</hi> and <hi>Avocation</hi> from them, I do now particularly warn you againſt the ſenſeleſs Folly of an Entanglement in any <hi>fooliſh Amour,</hi> while you are yet a Student at the College. 'Tis time enough, to think of <hi>Marriage,</hi> when your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in other Circumſtances as well as that of <hi>Age,</hi> will qualify you to make a <hi>Wiſe Choice,</hi> in a Point, which a very great <hi>Felicity,</hi> or a very great <hi>Calamity,</hi> for the reſt of your Days, will turn upon.</p>
            <p>§. 6. The <hi>Regulation of your Studies,</hi> is what I would now proceed unto. And for this, though
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:002772_0027_0FE62E9FA8D51448"/>the <hi>Regulae Studiorum,</hi> Written by <hi>Chytraeus,</hi> be a Book which I can heartily commend unto your Peruſal, yet, it being Written an Hundred and Twenty Years ago, I ſhall not think the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſal of <hi>That</hi> ſufficient for a Student in <hi>our</hi> Days. I muſt further Accommodate you. And here, <hi>Humanity</hi> would complain of me, if I ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to tell you, That the LATIN Tongue, which is more known and uſed than any upon Earth, except the <hi>Arabic,</hi> is what you ſhould for many Reaſons labour to be Ready at; and Able not only to <hi>Write,</hi> but alſo to <hi>Speak</hi> in it, with <hi>Fluency</hi> as well as <hi>Purity;</hi> and confute the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Obſervation, that tho' <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> do often <hi>Write</hi> [call <hi>Spencer</hi> and <hi>Burnet,</hi> for <hi>Two Witneſſes,</hi>] the beſt <hi>Latin</hi> in the World, yet they often <hi>Speak</hi> it but indifferently. For this Purpoſe you will do well frequently, both to employ your Pen, for compoſing <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> or <hi>Epiſtles</hi> in it; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to maintain frequent <hi>Conferences</hi> in it, with ſuch as underſtand the <hi>Phraſes</hi> and <hi>Beauties</hi> of it. Indeed, I know not a prettier Way, than this; Tranſlate into <hi>Engliſh</hi> the Paragraphs of ſome Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor who writes very good <hi>Latin</hi> [ſay, the <hi>Enchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridion Precum</hi> of a <hi>Boehm;</hi>] and then again, Laying aſide your Author, turn your own <hi>Engliſh</hi> into <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin;</hi> and ſo compare <hi>That</hi> with, and correct it from, your Authors. But at the ſame time, you ſhould familiarize yourſelf with the <hi>Style</hi> of ſome Authors, whoſe <hi>Latin</hi> cannot but ever Charm you with its Elegancies. On this Occaſion, I am as far from inviting you into the Guſt of <hi>Linacre,</hi> as great a Critic as moſt we have had for the <hi>Latin Tongue,</hi> who, <hi>Ciceronis dictionem, nunquam probare po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002772_0027_0FE62E9FA8D51448"/>nec ſine faſtidio audire;</hi> As I am, from invit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you into the <hi>Ciceronian</hi> Bigotry of a <hi>Bembo,</hi> or, to be as afraid as <hi>Longolius</hi> was of uſing the Word, <hi>Poſſibile.</hi> But yet I will preſume upon ſo much of <hi>Paradox,</hi> as to offer you my Opinion, (tho' I know what Cenſure a <hi>Quintilian</hi> would paſs upon me, for ſaying) That the <hi>Latin</hi> of an <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> of a <hi>Calvin,</hi> or of a <hi>Witſius,</hi> is preferrible unto <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi>'s; yea, to make up the Meſs, I am content that poor <hi>Caſtellio</hi> too be introduced.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Rome</hi> you muſt needs paſs to <hi>Greece.</hi> And I cannot but wiſh you ſo much a GRECIAN, as not only to underſtand your <hi>Greek Teſtament,</hi> better than they do ordinarily at this Day in <hi>Athens,</hi> in which, of all Places, it ſeems they now ſpeak the <hi>worſt Greek</hi> that is any where ſpoken; but alſo, that you may at leaſt be able to Read a <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> of the <hi>Savilian</hi> Edition; and not enjoy the <hi>Fathers</hi> only in the <hi>Latin Tranſlations,</hi> in which alone, the Roman Catholicks, (agreeably indeed unto the <hi>Name</hi> of their <hi>Church,</hi>) now generally chuſe to publiſh them and peruſe them. However, I can't encourage you, to throw away much Time, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Accurate Skill in the <hi>Greek Accents:</hi> But rather wholly to drop them, when your Quill comes to convey any <hi>Greek</hi> into your Pages. For, as the Writing of <hi>Greek</hi> otherwiſe than in <hi>Capitals,</hi> was introduced in later Ages by the Monks of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who borrowed the ſmaller Letters now uſed from the <hi>Copric;</hi> So, One ſhall hardly find any <hi>Accents</hi> on the <hi>Greek,</hi> in any Manuſcripts written above Eight Ages ago: Nor was the Invention of the <hi>Accents,</hi> with which our <hi>Greek</hi> is now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:002772_0028_0FE62EA0AFD6E320"/>of any other than a <hi>Muſical</hi> Intention. And, <hi>Voſſius,</hi> with <hi>Henninius</hi> after him, are not the only Gentlemen, who have declared earneſtly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt pronouncing the <hi>Greek</hi> according to the <hi>Accents:</hi> I pray, how would a Verſe of <hi>Homer</hi> ſound, if it were ſo pronounced?</p>
            <p>But for the HEBREW, I am importunate with you. And the more ſo, becauſe 'tis one Remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Inſtance of the <hi>Depraved Guſt,</hi> into which we are of later Years degenerated, that the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is fallen under ſo much Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repute, as to make a learned Man almoſt afraid of owning that he has any thing of it, leſt it ſhould bring him under the Suſpicion of being an Odd, Starv'd, Lank ſort of a thing, who had lived only on <hi>Hebrew Roots</hi> all his Days. What would an <hi>Amama,</hi> and the reſt of the brave Men, who ſhone in the former Age, and had <hi>Souls like the Gates of a Temple,</hi> ſay, if they might Riſe and ſee the <hi>Men of this Generation!</hi> 'Tis true, the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is, contrary to the old Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im, <hi>Difficilia quae Pulchra,</hi> with very little <hi>Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> attain'd unto. Even our little Damſels, like <hi>Blaeſilla,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Paula,</hi> (concerning the <hi>Mother</hi> of whom <hi>Jerom</hi> reports the ſame, that he does of the <hi>Daughter,</hi>) make nothing of coming at this Uncommon Ornament. And <hi>Cooper</hi> ſays, truly, that if Students would ſpend as much Time at it in a Morning or an Evening as they miſpend on an unprofitable Pipe of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> they would in a few Days be Maſters of it. It is alſo to be owned, that there appears nothing more impertinent, than a little <hi>Hebrician,</hi> Vapouring and Swaggering, as
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:002772_0028_0FE62EA0AFD6E320"/>if he had all the Learning in the World; and laying hold on all Occaſions to throw out an <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Clauſe or Word, for nothing but the Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his <hi>mighty Accompliſhment.</hi> Nevertheleſs, the Knowledge of the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> is to be valued and purſued, on this Deſign; 'Twill enable you to penetrate further into the <hi>deep Things</hi> which the <hi>Spirit of GOD</hi> has laid up in His Oracles, than you could poſſibly do, by ſeeing them only in ſome Tranſlation. Tho' with much more Cauſe than the modeſt <hi>Melancthon,</hi> I may confeſs <hi>Me vix primis Labiis deguſtaſſe Hebraicas Literas,</hi> yet as <hi>he</hi> declared, what <hi>Hebrew</hi> he had helped him ſo much in his Judgment of the greateſt Matters, he <hi>prefer'd it before all the Wealth of a Kingdom,</hi> ſo, <hi>I</hi> may hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly declare, I ſcarce ever take an <hi>Hebrew Bible</hi> into my Hands, but I am gratefully ſurprized with ſomething I never thought of; I ever have ſome <hi>new View,</hi> and ſee ſomething I never ſaw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. So that I do not wonder at <hi>Luther</hi> for mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>ſerious Proteſtation,</hi> that what <hi>Knowledge</hi> he had of the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> was of more Uſe and more Price to him, than the greateſt <hi>Heap of Gold</hi> that could be ſet before him.</p>
            <p>Indeed, I cannot but wiſh, that a Knowledge of the SYRIAC may come in, as an <hi>Appendix</hi> to your Knowledge of the <hi>Hebrew:</hi> Not meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was the <hi>Mother-Tongue</hi> unto the Writers of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> [which is the Reaſon that we have no Greek Word of the <hi>Dual Number</hi> in all the <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> For that Number is what the <hi>Syriac</hi> is a Stranger to:] But chiefly becauſe the moſt Valuable and Serviceable Verſion that
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:002772_0029_0FE62EA0B54000F8"/>we have of the Divine Oracles, and what may be of moſt Authority in many Important Points to clear up the Senſe of them, is the <hi>Syriac.</hi> And having once got the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> you'l find the <hi>Syriac</hi> eaſily come-at-able.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Living Tongues,</hi> 'tis a Matter of ſome Speculation, that almoſt all the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in the World, ſpeak the <hi>Teutonic</hi> and what is derived from it; almoſt all the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> are found in the Derivations from the <hi>Latin;</hi> the <hi>Greek Church</hi> is moſtly in the <hi>Sclavonic.</hi> If you intend any Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the Kingdom of GOD abroad, you may here take your Choice. But if you have any Time in your <hi>Short Life</hi> to ſpare for the <hi>Living Tongues,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> will be ſure in the firſt Place to <hi>Court</hi> you. And, tho' the Complement which the Nations of <hi>Europe</hi> have paid unto that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, has look'd like a paving of the Way, (which doubtleſs, the <hi>French Academy</hi> have had in their Eye) for the <hi>extending</hi> of a Covetous and Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Monarchy, <hi>To what will never be accompliſhed;</hi> yet, for the ſake of your Admiſſion to the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of many <hi>French Books</hi> that may be worth your Peruſal, I do not forbid your Learning of it. This, the rather, for that albeit the <hi>Engliſh Tongue</hi> is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being made the moſt Expreſſive, and the moſt Copious in the World, and is in theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards much Superiour to the <hi>French;</hi> neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, it may be obſerved, There is no Man who has the <hi>French Tongue,</hi> but ordinarily he ſpeaks the neater <hi>Engliſh</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>And yet, concerning the <hi>Languages</hi> in general; The <hi>Time</hi> allowed for them, ſhould certainly be
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:002772_0029_0FE62EA0B54000F8"/>proportion'd unto the <hi>Uſe</hi> you are like to make of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Dr. <hi>More</hi> governing himſelf in the Study of the <hi>Oriental Tongues</hi> by that Rule, pleaſantly and modeſtly compared himſelf unto the Man who paſſed by a <hi>Garriſon,</hi> with an <hi>Horſe Shoe</hi> at his <hi>Girdle;</hi> which received and repelled the <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi> ſhot upon him: On which he obſerved, <hi>That a little Armour, if well placed, will be ſufficient.</hi> I have known One who has been able to compoſe and publiſh Things in <hi>Seven Languages;</hi> and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to his Friends, <hi>That he could never get the Time to furniſh himſelf with much more than the Armour of his well placed Horſe Shoe.</hi> But be ſure, ſo much of the <hi>Armour</hi> as you cannot but foreſee you may have Occaſion for, — So much I inſiſt upon. I am far from urging you to ſtudy ſo many Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages as the Epitaph of that Great and Good Phyſician <hi>Kirſtenius,</hi> aſribed unto him the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of.</p>
            <p>§. 7. The <hi>Languages</hi> you will conſider, but as <hi>Inſtruments</hi> to come at the <hi>Sciences,</hi> wherewith you would propoſe to go <hi>Skilfully</hi> about the Work which your GOD ſhall call you to. And eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as rather <hi>Helps</hi> to <hi>Exudition</hi> than any <hi>Parts</hi> of it, you will no more Value yourſelf as a <hi>Scholar</hi> for <hi>Them,</hi> than the Bare having of <hi>Tools</hi> would make one to boaſt himſelf an <hi>Artiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you would make a ſhort Work of all the <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi> and find out a <hi>North-Weſt Paſſage</hi> to them, I cannot think of any One Author, that would anſwer every Intention ſo well as ALSTED. I take him, to have been as learned a Man as ever was in the World; and there being ſo little Uſe
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:002772_0030_0FE62EA5950B7768"/>made of his <hi>Conciſe Exhibitions,</hi> is to me, One of the Things that I can't but wonder at, and ſcarce know what to make of.</p>
            <p>Inſtead of Squandering away your Time, on the RHETORIC, whereof no doubt, you tho't, your <hi>Dugard</hi> gave you enough at School; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the <hi>Tropes</hi> and <hi>Schemes</hi> whereof a juſt Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer well obſerves, <hi>Poſſunt una at<expan>

            <p>But I will take this Opportunity to tell you, That there is no where to be found any ſuch <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toric,</hi> as there is in our <hi>Sacred Scriptures.</hi> Even a Pagan <hi>Longinus</hi> himſelf, will confeſs, The <hi>Sublime,</hi> ſhining in them. There can be nothing ſo <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,</hi> or ſo <hi>Affectuous</hi> as the <hi>Figures</hi> every where uſed in them. They are <hi>Life.</hi> All meer <hi>Humane Flouriſhes</hi> are but <hi>Chaff</hi> to the <hi>Wheat</hi> that is there. Yea, they are an <hi>Hammer that breaks the Rocks to Pieces.</hi> In them the <hi>GOD of Glory Thunders,</hi> yea, does it very <hi>marvellouſly!</hi> There is in them that <hi>Voice of the Lord</hi> which is <hi>full of Majeſty.</hi> For the <hi>Pulpit-Oratory,</hi> which is what you have in View, there can be nothing more adviſeable, than to be a Maſter of <hi>Scripture-Phraſes,</hi> and employ them with an agreeable Ingenuity, on all fit Occaſions.
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:002772_0030_0FE62EA5950B7768"/>I will add, I know not but a <hi>Lamy,</hi> in his <hi>L'Art de Parler,</hi> may give you ſome hints that may be not unuſeful to you.</p>
            <p>Nor can I encourage you to ſpend very much Time, in that which goes under the Name of LOGIC. If my excellent Friend <hi>Langius,</hi> in his Noble <hi>Medicina Mentis,</hi> [which I commend unto you, to be diligently peruſed, as an <hi>Introduction</hi> to all your Studies of the <hi>Sciences,</hi>] had not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled me to a Contempt of the <hi>Vulgar Logic,</hi> learnt in our Colleges, as a ſort of meer <hi>Morology,</hi> yet a little ſerious Recollection would have brought me to it. What is there uſually got by the <hi>Vulgar Logic,</hi> but only to be furniſhed with a Parcel of <hi>Terms,</hi> which inſtead of leading the Mind into the <hi>Truth,</hi> enables one rather to carry on <hi>Altercations,</hi> and <hi>Logomachies,</hi> by which the Force of <hi>Truth</hi> may be at Pleaſure, and by ſome little <hi>Trick,</hi> evaded. The Power and Proceſs of <hi>Reaſon</hi> is <hi>Natural</hi> to the Soul of Man; And thoſe <hi>Maſters of Reaſon,</hi> who argue the moſt <hi>Rationally,</hi> and make the moſt <hi>Rational Reſearches</hi> into the true State of Things, and who take the moſt <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Meaſures</hi> for their Conduct, and who in all things arrive to the moſt notable Diſcoveries, <hi>I</hi> pray, what ſort of <hi>Logicians</hi> are they? Either they never once read a Page of any <hi>Burgeſdicius,</hi> or elſe they have unlearnt and forgot all their <hi>Vulgar Logic. I</hi> am ſure, they rarely trouble their Heads to recall the <hi>Old Rules</hi> which they have recited unto their Tutors. To exhibit in the pompous Form of an <hi>Art,</hi> what every One does by meer <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> and fabricate it into ſuch a
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:002772_0031_0FE62EA59ACED2D0"/>ſhape as that of the <hi>Vulgar Logic,</hi> and with ſuch trifling Applications and Illuſtrations, as 'tis uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally done, appears as impertinent, as if one ſhould with much Formality teach the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Eating</hi> or <hi>Drinking</hi> or <hi>Walking.</hi> And it might with equal Solemnity be ſhown, what Points of <hi>Regular Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement</hi> are exemplified by the Boys playing at their Marbles. The moſt Valuable Thing in <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic,</hi> and the very Termination of it, is, <hi>The Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Syllogiſms.</hi> And yet it is notorious, that as all <hi>Syllogizing</hi> is only to confirm you in a <hi>Truth</hi> which you are already the Owner of, ſo, no <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic</hi> has yet given us all the ſeveral Ways of <hi>Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gizing</hi> that may be run into; And it is as notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that while an expanded <hi>Syllogizing</hi> is rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned no other than an Indecency in ordinary <hi>Writing</hi> as well as <hi>Talking,</hi> our only <hi>Syllogizing</hi> is that which we call, <hi>An Enthymeme:</hi> Such a thing is evident, and <hi>therefore</hi> ſuch a Thing to be infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from it, is alſo evident. <hi>Notwithſtanding, leſt we ſhould offend them,</hi> go dip into your <hi>Logic.</hi> But count it enough, if you have gone through a <hi>Milton,</hi> or a <hi>Gutberleth,</hi> or a <hi>Watts.</hi> Indeed, ſome Treatiſes, that clear up the <hi>Maxims of Reaſon,</hi> and may Strengthen you and Sharpen you in the Uſe of it, you may do well to look into. The <hi>Ars Cogitendi,</hi> may paſs for One of thoſe: And tho' for ſome Reaſons, I would be excuſed from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending an <hi>Eſſay of Humane Underſtanding,</hi> which is much in Vogue, yet I can approve your peruſing of <hi>Oldfield,</hi> his <hi>Improvement of Reaſon.</hi> But for the <hi>Vulgar Logic,</hi> I muſt freely ſay, you loſe Time, if you ſteer any otherwiſe in it, than, <hi>Touch and Go.</hi>

What I ſay of <hi>Logic,</hi> I ſay of <hi>Metaphyſicks;</hi> which a learned Man too juſtly calls, <hi>Diſciplinarum Omnium Excrementum,</hi> tho' ſhe would ſet up for the <hi>Queen of Sciences.</hi> If you have got a <hi>Maccovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> or a <hi>Jacchaeus</hi> into your Head, you have as much as I ſhould care for: To which indeed ſome Acquaintance with a <hi>Caſtanaeus,</hi> or ſome ſuch <hi>Fencer</hi> for <hi>Diſtinctions,</hi> may be added. But then to Weave any more <hi>Cobwebs</hi> in your Brains; to what Purpoſe is it? This however, is one of the <hi>Things,</hi> which I will <hi>Affirm conſtantly;</hi> That as a <hi>Suarez,</hi> than whom you cannot eaſily find a greater dealer in <hi>Metaphyſicks,</hi> after all declared, The <hi>Hours</hi> which he took in Studying and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining and Rectifying his <hi>own Heart,</hi> were of infinitely more Uſe and Worth to him than all his <hi>Metaphyſical</hi> and Voluminous Lucubrations; you ſhall in like manner find, that you may eaſily employ your <hi>Hours</hi> to better Purpoſe, than in <hi>Metaphyſical</hi> and Imaginary Diſquiſitions.</p>
            <p>As for ETHICS, tho' ſuch Things as the, <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca Chriſtiana</hi> of a <hi>Daneus,</hi> be among the <hi>Things which cannot be ſpoken againſt,</hi> yet of <hi>That</hi> whereon they employ the <hi>Plough</hi> ſo long in many Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, I will venture to ſay, 'tis a <hi>Vile Thing;</hi> and no other than what honeſt <hi>Vockerodus</hi> has juſtly called it; <hi>Impietas in Artis formam redacta.</hi> It is all over a <hi>Sham;</hi> It preſents you with a <hi>Mock-Happineſs;</hi> It preſcribes to you <hi>Mock Vertues</hi> for the coming at it: And it pretends to give you a Religion without a CHRIST, and a <hi>Life</hi> of PIE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY without a <hi>Living Principle;</hi> a <hi>Good Life</hi> with no other than <hi>Dead Works</hi> filling of it.

            <p>So much <hi>Ethics</hi> as treats, <hi>De Decorc,</hi> and may inſtruct you in the, <hi>Rules of Behaviour,</hi> I bearrily commend unto you.

            <p>§. 8. POETRY, whereof we have now even an <hi>Antediluvian Piece</hi> in our Hands, has from the Beginning been in ſuch Requeſt, that I muſt needs recommend unto you ſome Acquaintance with it. Though ſome have had a Soul ſo <hi>Unmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical,</hi>

And beſides your <hi>Lyrick Hours,</hi> I wiſh you may ſo far underſtand an <hi>Epic Poem,</hi> that the Beauties of an <hi>Homer</hi> and a <hi>Virgil</hi> may be diſcerned with you. As to the <hi>Moral</hi> Part of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> 'tis true, and let me not be counted a <hi>Zoilus</hi> for ſaying ſo, that by firſt exhibiting their <hi>Gods</hi> as no better than <hi>Rogues,</hi> he ſet open the Flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates for a prodigious Inundation of Wickedneſs to break in upon the Nations, and was one of the <hi>greateſt Apoſtles</hi> the <hi>Devil</hi> ever had in the World. Among the reſt that felt the Ill Impreſſions of this <hi>Univerſal Corrupter,</hi> (as Men of the beſt Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents have called him,) One was that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown Robber, of execrable Memory, whom we celebrate under the Name of <hi>Alexander the Great;</hi> who by his continual Admiring and Studying of his <hi>Iliad,</hi> and by following that falſe Model of Heroic Virtue ſet before him in his <hi>Achilles,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came one of the worſt of Men, and at length in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flated with the Ridiculous Pride of being himſelf a <hi>Deity,</hi> expoſed himſelf to all the Scorn that could belong unto a <hi>Lunatick.</hi> And hence, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Veneration which this Idol has had, yet <hi>Plato</hi> baniſhes him our of a <hi>Common-Wealth,</hi> the Welfare whereof he was concerned for. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, <hi>Cuſtom</hi> or <hi>Conſcience</hi> obliges him to bear
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:002772_0033_0FE62EAE8D9631F8"/>Teſtimonies unto many Points of <hi>Morality.</hi> And it is eſpecially obſervable, That he commonly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds <hi>Prayer</hi> to Heaven as a moſt neceſſary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face unto all Important Enterprizes; and when the Action comes on too ſuddenly for a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Supplication,</hi> he yet will not let it come on without an Ejaculation; and he never ſpeaks of any <hi>Supplication</hi> but he brings in a Gracious Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to it. I have ſeen a Traveſteering <hi>High-Flyer,</hi> not much to our Diſhonour, Scoff at <hi>Homer</hi> for this; as making his Actors to be like thoſe whom the Engliſh call <hi>Diſſenters.</hi> But then, we are ſo much led into the Knowledge of <hi>Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> by reading of this <hi>Poet,</hi> and into ſo many Parts of the <hi>Recondite Learning,</hi> that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome little <hi>Nods</hi> in him, not a few Acute Pens beſides the old Biſhop of <hi>Theſſalonica</hi>'s, have got a Reputation by regaling us with <hi>Annotations</hi> upon him. Yea, Tho' One can't but ſmile at the Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of <hi>Croeſe,</hi> who tries with much Oſtentation of Erudition, to ſhow, That <hi>Homer</hi> has all along ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred us in a Diſguiſe and Fable, the <hi>Hiſtory of the Old Teſtament,</hi> yet many Illuſtrations of the <hi>ſacred Scriptures,</hi> I find are to be fetched from him; who indeed had probably read what was Extant of them in his Days; Particularly, Our <hi>Eighteenth Pſalm</hi> is what he has evidently imitated. <hi>Virgil</hi> too, who ſo much lived upon him, as well as after him, is unaccountably mad upon his <hi>Fate,</hi> which he makes to be he knows not what himſelf, but Superiour to <hi>Gods</hi> as well as to <hi>Men,</hi> and thro' his whole Compoſures he ſo aſſerts the Doctrine of this Nonſenſical Power, as is plainly inconſiſtent with all Virtue. And what <hi>fatal Miſchief</hi> did

Wherefore if his <hi>Aeneis,</hi> which tho' it were once near twenty times as big as he has left it, yet he has left it unfiniſhed, may not appear ſo valuable to you, that you may think <hi>Twenty ſeven Verſes</hi> of the Part that is the moſt finiſhed in it, worth One and Twenty Hundred Pounds and odd Money, yet his <hi>Georgicks,</hi> which he put his laſt Hand unto, will furniſh you with many things far from Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable.

            <p>[There has been a deal of a do about a STYLE; So much, that I muſt offer you my Sentiments upon it. There is a <hi>Way of Writing,</hi> wherein the Author endeavours, that the Reader may have <hi>ſomething to the Purpoſe</hi> in every Paragraph. There is not only a <hi>Vigour</hi> ſenſible in every <hi>Sentence,</hi> but the Paragraph is embelliſhed with <hi>Profitable Refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi> even to ſomething beyond what is <hi>directly ſpoken.</hi> Formal and Painful <hi>Quotations</hi> are not ſtudied; yet all that could be learnt from them is inſinuated. The Writer pretends not unto <hi>Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> yet he could not have writ as he does if he had not <hi>Read</hi> very much in his Time; and his Compoſures are not only a <hi>Cloth of Gold,</hi> but alſo ſtuck with as many <hi>Jewels,</hi> as the Gown of a Ruſſian Embaſſador. This <hi>Way of Writing</hi> has been decried by many, and is at this Day more than ever ſo, for the ſame Reaſon, that in the old Story, the <hi>Grapes</hi> were decried, <hi>That they were not Ripe.</hi> A Lazy, Ignorant, Conceited Sett of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, would perſwade the whole Tribe, to lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide that <hi>Way of Writing,</hi> for the ſame Reaſon that one would have perſwaded his Brethren to part with the Encumbrance of their <hi>Buſby Tails.</hi> But<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And yet perhaps, there may be ſome Need for me to Caution you againſt being <hi>Diſmay'd at the Signs of the Heavens,</hi> or having any Superſtitious Fancies upon <hi>Eclipſes</hi> and the like Occurrences, or thinking that if there were a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of all the Planets</hi> in <hi>Piſces,</hi> it would por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that the World ſhould be <hi>Drowned.</hi> Yea, I am willing that the <hi>Cometomancy</hi> which has hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo much reigned, even in the moſt <hi>Honeſt

For my Part, I know not whether all our <hi>Worlds,</hi> and even the <hi>Sun</hi> it ſelf, may not fare the better for them. Some, that know more than I, do think ſo.

<pb n="72" facs="unknown:002772_0049_0FE62EE1A3A3CF50"/>whereof you will certainly find an inexpreſſible and almoſt incredible Advantage.</p>
            <p>One Thing that I adviſe you to, is This. Keep your QUOTIDIANA. I mean Have your <hi>Blank Books,</hi> in which <hi>Note</hi> with your Pen, for the moſt Part <hi>Every Day,</hi> [Let there be, <hi>Nulla Dies ſine Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea!</hi>] Some <hi>Notable Thing,</hi> which in Reading you have newly met withal. By this Action you will <hi>fix</hi> the <hi>Valuable Notion</hi> in your Mind: And in a few Years, you will have a <hi>Treaſure,</hi> from whence as a <hi>Scribe inſtructed for the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> you may <hi>bring out Things New and Old,</hi> and have agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Grains of Salt</hi> for all your Diſcourſes. You will not for this, Uſe the <hi>Unequal Way,</hi> of entring the Riches, of your <hi>Quotidiana,</hi> in Pages with the <hi>Titles of a Common-Place</hi> at the Tops of them, whereof ſome will be ſoon <hi>Crammed,</hi> and others remain <hi>Empty,</hi> perhaps all your Days: But, <hi>Enter the Things as they come,</hi> with only affixing the <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> to them: And have, at the End of the Books an <hi>Alphabetical Index,</hi> of the <hi>Matter,</hi> with the <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> at which it is to be met withal. Here you will anon have an inexhauſtible <hi>Magazine;</hi> and if you live to <hi>Old Age,</hi> you will find, that, like Old <hi>Photius,</hi> you have prepared an <hi>Hive</hi> then to live upon. I will not ſay, you will be quickly as rich as <hi>Craeſus;</hi> for poor <hi>Craeſus</hi> will have no Riches comparable to what you will have in your Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections.</p>
            <p>Another Thing that I adviſe you to, is This. Form a SODALITY. What I mean, is, Prevail with a Fit Number, [<hi>Six</hi> or <hi>Seven</hi> may be a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency, or Fewer, if you can't find ſo many,] of Sober, Ingenious, and Induſtrious Young Men,

I. What in <hi>Philology?</hi> II. What in <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy?</hi> III. What in <hi>Geography,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>M thematicks?</hi> IV. What in <hi>Hiſtory?</hi> V. What in <hi>Illuſtrations</hi> of the <hi>Sacred Scriptures;</hi> Or, <hi>Biblical Curioſities?</hi> Let each Perſon, in what Order they ſhall agree upon, give his Report as <hi>Conciſely</hi> as may be. But it will not be expected, that each Perſon ſhould be prepared, at <hi>every Time,</hi> with ſomething on <hi>every Head:</hi> It is enough, that he bring in, for that <hi>Cell,</hi> which he happens to be beſt furniſhed for. All <hi>Altercations,</hi> and all <hi>Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencies,</hi> are to be forever baniſhed from thoſe <hi>Communications</hi> of the <hi>Sodality.</hi> But how much could I wiſh, that you could gain one Quarter of an Hour in the cloſe of all, to relate, <hi>What rare Flight or fine Stroke of the</hi> Chriſtian Aſceticks, <hi>has been met withal; and what for the Animation of Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical PIETY?</hi> Behold, a way to clench the <hi>Nails</hi> that have been ſtruck into your Minds; and a Compendious and Charitable Courſe to come at the <hi>Wealth,</hi> which the <hi>Diligence</hi> of your Brethren has made them the Owners of; together with the <hi>generous Pleaſure</hi> of making them the Partakers of yours.

The <hi>Commentaries</hi> of our <hi>Henry</hi> on the Bible, have out-done moſt that we have yet had, in this Regard: The SPIRIT which dictated the <hi>Sacred Scriptures,</hi> operating on the Mind of the Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator, in the Diſpoſitions and Obſervations of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Piety.</hi> The <hi>Erudition</hi> alſo appearing, without Affectation of <hi>Appearance,</hi> in them, is far from Contemptible.

            </p>
            <p>That you may have a general Inſight into POLEMIC DIVINITY, and at once make a ſhort Viſit with Safety, to the Camp in the Valley of <hi>Elah,</hi> and ſee the <hi>Men of Iſrael fighting with the Philiſtines,</hi> you have much done for you in <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,</hi> his, <hi>Faſciculus:</hi> But there are two little <hi>Duo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decimo's,</hi> which for this Purpoſe are worth more than Twelve times their Weight in Gold; Theſe are the, <hi>Turris David,</hi> and the, <hi>Turris Babel,</hi> of the Wondrous <hi>Alſted.</hi> There is alſo a little Book in the Engliſh Tongue, <hi>Sinclare,</hi> his, <hi>Truths Victory over Error,</hi> which is worthy to be called, <hi>Enchiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dion Militis Chriſtiani.</hi> I will ſay nothing of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Book publiſhed among ourſelves under the Title of, <hi>Supplies from the Tower of David.</hi>

            <p>But it is of the laſt Importance, that you be a GOOD CASUIST: And an <hi>Ames,</hi> in his <hi>Caſus Conſcientiae,</hi> an <hi>Alſted,</hi> in his <hi>Theologia Caſuum,</hi> a <hi>Baxter</hi> in his <hi>Directory,</hi> and a <hi>Baldwin,</hi> in his Book, <hi>De Caſibus Conſcientiae,</hi> have done what will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly Qualify you to paſs a <hi>Judgment</hi> upon the <hi>Caſes,</hi> that may ly before you, and well diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the <hi>Clean</hi> from the <hi>Unclean,</hi> in your Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of your Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>Abundance has been written, to recommend, <hi>The Study of the FATHERS:</hi> And it has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by none more than ſome <hi>Neotericks</hi> and <hi>Innovators,</hi> who have had very <hi>Indirect Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> in it, and hoped that the <hi>Fathers</hi> might help them with ſome Traditions, where the <hi>Scriptures</hi> failed them. What Attempts have there been therefore to ſet the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> of <hi>Ignatius</hi> almoſt on
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:002772_0057_0FE62EFE979C0D58"/>the Level with the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> of our Inſpired Apoſtles; while after all the learned Impertinencies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſome would maintain the larger, and ſome the leſſer Copies of thoſe <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> and painful Diſputations, on the Problem, <hi>How many of them are Genuine;</hi> They are all of them <hi>Impoſtures,</hi> and not worthy of any Notice with you. What ado has there been, to ſet up, <hi>The Apoſtolical Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> as the moſt Valuable Part of the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> when they are evidently deſpicable and deteſtable <hi>Forgeries;</hi> and the Collections of ſome Ignorant <hi>Arian</hi> in the Fifth Century? You may be ſure, that in the <hi>Study of the Fathers,</hi> I ſhall at leaſt adviſe you to ſo much Knowledge of them, as <hi>Daille</hi> in his Excellent Book of, <hi>The Uſe of the Fathers,</hi> will inſtruct you in. But, tho' the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> had ſuch <hi>Errors,</hi> that we may moſt ſenſibly Bleſs GOD, for His granting us the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> to be on all Accounts Better and Safer <hi>Guides</hi> unto us, and the <hi>Fathers</hi> themſelves do times without Number urge us to take none but the <hi>Scriptures</hi> for our <hi>Guides,</hi> and their notorious <hi>Deficiences</hi> in ſeveral Points of Literature, laid them under <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages</hi> enough to pall and ſpoil our Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them! Nevertheleſs, there are thoſe Writings of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> which I would have you no Strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to. If you beſtow a Peruſal upon, the Epiſtles of <hi>Clemens Romanus,</hi> and the <hi>Apologies</hi> of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> and of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and the Book of <hi>Origen</hi> againſt <hi>Celjus,</hi> you will do what I would have you to do. And I am willing you ſhould look upon the <hi>Dialogue</hi> of <hi>Minutius Faelix</hi> as one of the moſt celebrated Monuments of Antiquity. But how can I perſwade you to peruſe all the Folio-Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns,
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:002772_0057_0FE62EFE979C0D58"/>of both the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. I look on <hi>Theodoret,</hi> as the beſt Expoſitor of the Bible among all the <hi>Fathers;</hi> and there are very Notable and Refined Expoſitions often occurring in him; Yet I ſhall direct you to do little more than <hi>Conſult him upon Occaſion.</hi> I value <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as much as much as they tell us <hi>Aquinas</hi> did: Yet I ſhall only wiſh you to attend upon him in ſome <hi>Select Homilies;</hi> and, <hi>Conſult him upon Occaſion.</hi> I am not ſo enamoured on <hi>Auſtin,</hi> as (like <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius</hi>) to Read over all his Works ten times, and his Book, <hi>De Gratia,</hi> thirty times; I ſhall count it enough, if you go thro' his, <hi>Confeſſions,</hi> and his <hi>Meditations,</hi> and his <hi>De Civitate Dei,</hi> and ſome Numbers of his <hi>Letters. Scultet</hi> in his, <hi>Medulla Theologiae Patrum,</hi> have given you ſuch <hi>Abſtracts</hi> of what has been written by many of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> as your Eye to good Purpoſe may dwell upon. But for a more agreeable and profitable <hi>Study of the Fathers,</hi> I ſhall propoſe, That you go thro' <hi>Dupin,</hi> his <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory:</hi> And where you find an Account of any <hi>Subject</hi> handled by any <hi>Father,</hi> which you have a particular Inclination to ſee what they ſay upon: <hi>Then</hi> turn to the Author, and ſeek for further Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>§. 16. After all this <hi>Preparation for the Sanctuary,</hi> you are now coming to feed the Flocks on the <hi>High Mountains of Iſrael;</hi> Coming into an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment among the People of GOD, in which, I wiſh you may prove like the <hi>Angel,</hi> in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> that <hi>came down from Heaven, and the Earth was ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened with his Glory.</hi> I am now going to bring you into the PULPIT: Which I hope, you
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:002772_0058_0FE62F0F99DFCF50"/>will aſcend [as <hi>Luther,</hi> when he was much older than you, ſays, <hi>he ſtill always did!</hi>] with a <hi>Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Soul;</hi> and remembring that you are to ſtand, where, that which the Jewiſh Senator ſaid unto the greateſt Perſon among them, is what the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of GOD may ſay unto you; <hi>Non ſtas coram nobis, ſed coram eo qui dixit,</hi> Fiat, <hi>et factus eſt Mundus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a <hi>Troop</hi> of Authors, and even an <hi>Hoſt of GOD,</hi> who have written on, <hi>The Paſtoral Care,</hi> from the Days of <hi>Gregory,</hi> down to the Days of <hi>Gilbert;</hi> Yea, and ſince theſe, every Year ſome to this very Day. I cannot ſet you ſo tedious a Task, as to Read a <hi>Tenth Part,</hi> of what has been offered on the <hi>Art,</hi> and the <hi>Gift,</hi> and the <hi>Method</hi> of PREACHING. If you Read, the <hi>Paſtor E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelicus,</hi> of a <hi>Bowles;</hi> Or, <hi>The Preacher,</hi> of an <hi>Edwards;</hi> you will do as much this Way, as I ſhall at preſent ask you to do.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Firſt Thing,</hi> which I have to demand of you, is, That you entertain the People of GOD, with none but <hi>Well-Studied Sermons;</hi> and employ none but <hi>well beaten Oil,</hi> for the <hi>Lamps</hi> of the <hi>Golden Candleſtick:</hi> And be nothing like him, who was among the <hi>Jews</hi> called, <hi>The Plagiary Prophet,</hi> and whoſe Puniſhment was not an eaſy one. Heaven forbid, that you ſhould be one of thoſe <hi>Pitiful Parſons,</hi> to whom there has been that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice given for the Diſcharge of their <hi>Paſtoral Care;</hi> That <hi>they ſhould uſe other Men's Sermons, rather than make any of their own: But in the Choice of theſe, uſe great Judgment, and not take an Author that is too much above themſelves; for by that, Compared with
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:002772_0058_0FE62F0F99DFCF50"/>their ordinary Converſation, it will too evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that they are not the Authors of their Sermons.</hi> Tis true; The Compoſures of them that have gone before you, may be <hi>of Uſe</hi> unto you, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply you with <hi>Uſeful Hints</hi> for the Compoſing of your <hi>Sermons.</hi> And ſome have ingeniouſly aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, <q>That a Man of <hi>Mean Abilities,</hi> may come to fall very little ſhort of the <hi>Ableſt Preachers,</hi> if he ſo carefully <hi>Peruſe</hi> their Sermons, as entirely to <hi>digeſt</hi> them, and then, laying them out of his <hi>View,</hi> proceed in his <hi>own Way,</hi> and in his <hi>own Style,</hi> to deliver them.</q> Let <hi>that</hi> be as Men pleaſe; <hi>This</hi> I inſiſt upon; That when you are to <hi>Preach,</hi> you ſhould go directly from your Knees in your <hi>Study</hi> to the <hi>Pulpit;</hi> and when you are thus on your Knees in your <hi>Study,</hi> you ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayl the <hi>Faulty Defects</hi> in your Life, which the <hi>Subject</hi> you are to treat upon ſhould lead you to a pentient Confeſſion of: Humbly bewayling it alſo, that your <hi>Sermon</hi> is no better fitted for the awful Service that is before you. Your <hi>Sermon</hi> muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be ſuch, that you may hope to have the <hi>Blood</hi> of your SAVIOUR ſprinkled on it, and His <hi>Good</hi> SPIRIT breathing in it. A <hi>Sermon</hi> likewiſe it muſt be, that ſhall diſcover you to be a <hi>Workman;</hi> and be, like the <hi>Peace-Offerings</hi> of old, an Oblation, which, as the People of GOD have their ſhare in it, ſo, 'tis preſented unto the Glorious GOD Himſelf, the <hi>Great King, whoſe Name is Venerable.</hi> How ſuch things as theſe, can be Compatible to <hi>ſtolen Sermons,</hi> or Concomitant with them, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine!</p>
            <p>I paſs on, to adviſe you, That when you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>ſettled Prcacher</hi> the <hi>Subject</hi> of your <hi>Sermens</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="unknown:002772_0059_0FE62F0F9E83B8C8"/>may be ſo <hi>well choſen,</hi> as to do therein the part of a <hi>Prudent and Faithful Steward,</hi> who diſpenſes to every one their <hi>Food</hi> in the <hi>Seaſon</hi> thereof; and a Vigilant <hi>Watchman,</hi> contriving ſuch <hi>Words in Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> as will be <hi>fitly ſpoken.</hi> You may do well to go thro' the whole <hi>Body of Divinity,</hi> in a proper <hi>Method,</hi> and therein <hi>declare the whole Counſel of GOD.</hi> There are alſo ſome Rich <hi>Portions,</hi> and <hi>Paragraphs</hi> of the <hi>Sacred Scriptures,</hi> wherein the SPIRIT of GOD lays together an admirable Variety of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant <hi>Subjects,</hi> which you may do well to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, in the <hi>Order</hi> wherein He has provided them for you. But ſtill, notwithſtanding the Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Diſcourſes, I would have you leave Room for <hi>Occaſional Subjects;</hi> and have your <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentheſes</hi> of <hi>Sermons</hi> on ſuch Things, as you may apprehend the <hi>Neceſſities</hi> of the People may more immediately and importunately call for. So, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as a <hi>Thick Cloud</hi> that has <hi>Water bound up</hi> in it, you ſhall (as the Ancients expounded that Paſſage in <hi>Job</hi>) diſtil it in Drops, <hi>Juxta Exigentiam Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum.</hi> That you may be led from time to time unto ſuch Subjects as may beſt anſwer the <hi>Deſigns</hi> with which your Miniſtry is to be carried on, you muſt have your <hi>Eyes ever towards the Lord,</hi> and with Solemn Supplications look up to Him, who <hi>Miniſtreth Seed to the Sower.</hi> But let me particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly commend one piece of Diſcretion unto you; which is, That you may be ſo <hi>laid in Aforehand,</hi> as never to be at a Loſs, what Subject your Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are to proceed upon. From the Want of this Proviſion, how often have I known a <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> ſpend almoſt as much Time in determining what Subject he ſhould preach upon, as there
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:002772_0059_0FE62F0F9E83B8C8"/>need go for the making of a <hi>Sermon</hi> upon it! But I very much Object againſt your being <hi>too long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Subject:</hi> Which way of tedious Amplification, muſt needs leave much of the <hi>ſacred Field</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plough'd upon, that is too rich to ly always neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; and produce many Sermons as <hi>little to the Text,</hi> as I ſuſpect many of that <hi>German Divine</hi>'s were, who undertook to go over the whole Book of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and was no leſs than <hi>Twenty Years</hi> on the <hi>Firſt Chapter</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>And here, I cannot go any further, until I have given you my Sentiments upon ſomething that calls for a great Conſideration with you.</p>
            <p>Among all the Subjects, with which you <hi>Feed</hi> the People of GOD, I beſeech you, Let not the true <hi>Bread of Life</hi> be forgotten; but exhibit as much as you can of a Glorious CHRIST unto them: Yea, Let the <hi>Motto</hi> upon your whole Miniſtry, be, CHRIST IS ALL. It has been among the <hi>Grievous Things,</hi> which I have ſeen in the Days of my Pilgrimage, that not only in ſome of the moſt celebrated <hi>Sermons,</hi> which we have ſeen publiſhed on the moſt Illuſtrious and Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Occaſions, a CHRIST is (not one <hi>Tenth Part</hi> ſo often mentioned, as He is only in the <hi>Ten</hi> firſt Verſes of the Firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> I ſay) not ſo much as <hi>once</hi> mentioned; but alſo ſome of your Great Men have it related of them as an Inſtance of their <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> that they gave it as their Advice unto Miniſters, <hi>That they ſhould not Preach much about the Perſon of CHRIST.</hi> I have thought; Would a Bleſſed PAUL have <hi>uttered</hi> ſuch a Word! A PAUL, who ſaid, <hi>I determined
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:002772_0060_0FE62F10A4C7BDB0"/>to know nothing among you, ſave JESUS CHRIST, and Him Crucified.</hi> It is reported by ſome Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, That in the <hi>Mah<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

GOD forbid! I make no Doubt of it, That the almoſt Epidemical Extinction of True <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> or what is little ſhort of it, in the Nations that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it, is very much owing to the inexcuſeable <hi>Impiety</hi> of overlooking a Glorious CHRIST, ſo much in the <hi>Empty Harangues,</hi> which often paſs for <hi>Sermons.</hi> Alas, That there ſhould be ſo many <hi>Preachers,</hi> (I can't ſay of the <hi>Goſpel!</hi>) to whom there might be commended as proper for them, the Treatiſe Entituled, <hi>Paraeneſis ad Pſeudo-Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licos noſtri Saeculi, de CHRISTO DEO ipſis IGNOTO!</hi> The Holy SPIRIT of GOD forever aims at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, than what our SAVIOUR has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in that Word; <hi>He will Glorify me:</hi> And that Holy SPIRIT withdraws from the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> which has in it little Concern to <hi>Glorify Him;</hi> and it is therefore an <hi>Unſucceſsful Miniſtry.</hi> Let your <hi>Performance</hi> in the <hi>Pulpit</hi> be what it will, I muſt freely tell you, <hi>Non ſapit mihi, niſi ſonuerit ibi JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS.</hi> What I wiſh for and urge to, is This; That your <hi>Knowledge of the Myſtery of CHRIST,</hi> may Conſpicuouſly ſhine in your <hi>Sermons;</hi> and that it may be eſteemed by you, as a Matchleſs <hi>Grace given</hi> you, if you may <hi>Preach the Unſearchable

            <p>You may Expect, that I ſhould more Poſitively ſay, What Engliſh <hi>Treatiſes of Practical Divinity,</hi> I would commend unto you.

You have a <hi>Goodwin</hi> that will place you among the <hi>Children of Light,</hi> and will give you the very <hi>Marrow</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine which is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Godlineſs:</hi> He often ſoars like an <hi>Eagle;</hi> Perhaps, you would have been content, if ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a little more <hi>Conciſely.</hi> Every thing of a <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil,</hi> is Evangelical and Valuable: Eſpecially his, <hi>Speculum Theologiae in Chriſto.</hi> When your Heart and your Pen want the <hi>Holy Fire</hi> to be quickened with you, a <hi>Baxter</hi> will bring you a <hi>Coal from the Altar</hi> for it.

A <hi>Bates</hi> will treat you with <hi>Angels Food.</hi> An <hi>How</hi> will ſet <hi>Manly Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> before you. In a <hi>Flavel,</hi> you will find the true Savour of Plain, Lively, Uſeful Preaching. What a <hi>Collings</hi> has written on <hi>Providence,</hi> is well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. And what a <hi>Ford</hi> has written on, <hi>The Spirit of Bondage and Adoption,</hi> is as fine as any thing I have ſeen for, <hi>the Experimental</hi> And, tho' a <hi>Doolittle</hi> may not paſs for one of our <hi>Greateſt Men,</hi> yet having in his Book on the <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> given us the <hi>Body of Divinity</hi> all in a Flame, I am willing that it ſhould be, [what <hi>Zoroaſter</hi> called his famous Book, <hi>Zundaveſta,</hi> which, tho' written above two and twenty Hundred Years ago, we ſtill have in our Hands,] a <hi>Fire Kindler</hi> for you, and put you in the Way after an Awakening Manner, to ſet <hi>Conſcience</hi> about its Work, when you come to that <hi>Application,</hi> with which your <hi>Sermons</hi> are ſtill to be enlivened. If you go further back, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up to a <hi>Perkins,</hi> you will find in many Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes, that <hi>Good old Puritan Divinity,</hi> which the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of, <hi>The old Way,</hi> belong unto: And, <hi>No Man having drunk that old Wine,</hi> and ſuch Books, as the <hi>Chriſtians Daily Walk,</hi> of a <hi>Scudder, will</hi> much <hi>deſire the new, but he will ſay, The old is Better.</hi> If we mean to go to Heaven, we ſhall not miſs our Way by having <hi>Iſaac Ambroſe</hi> in our Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.

               <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah</hi>) have a ſingular Flavour and Vigour in them. Every thing of an <hi>Arrowſmith,</hi> is admirable. A <hi>Gurnal</hi> will furniſh you with a <hi>Magazine,</hi> of Good Things. Of an A. <hi>Burgeſs,</hi> I may ſay, <hi>He has written for thee Excellent Things.</hi> A <hi>Reinolds</hi> too muſt be taken into the Liſt of them, who have written what none will Repentt he Reading of. His Preparations are <hi>Fat things full Marrow, Wines from the Lees well refined.</hi> And ſome things of a <hi>Burroughs,</hi> eſpecially his, <hi>Moſes's Choice,</hi> will not make you complain, that you have loſt your Time in Converſing with them.</p>
            <p>In fine; The Six Volumns of, <hi>The Morning Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes,</hi> will give you ſuch a <hi>Variety,</hi> both of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> and of <hi>Talents,</hi> that I could wiſh you may not be without them.</p>
            <p>I may not omit giving you the beſt Encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I can, to allow unto a Box of <hi>North-Britiſh</hi> Authors, a ſtanding in your Library, and often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort unto it. The Jews have a Fancy, that when our Almighty Creator, beſpangled the Heavens with the <hi>Stars of Light,</hi> He left a ſpace near the <hi>Northern Pole,</hi> unfiniſhed and unfurniſhed, that if any <hi>After-God</hi> ſhould lay claim to Deity, a Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to fill up that ſpace might Eternally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute it. But in the <hi>Firmament</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> that <hi>Northern Part</hi> which belongs to <hi>Scotland,</hi> has been illuminated with <hi>Stars,</hi> even enough to make a <hi>Galaxy.</hi> And tho' the aſſiduous Employments of the <hi>Pariſh</hi> and the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> which are enough to take up all the Time of their <hi>Paſtors,</hi> have prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, [which, <hi>'tis a Pity!</hi>] the appearing of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Writers,</hi> among them, as might otherwiſe have

            <p>About the <hi>Way of Studying</hi> a Sermon, I exhort you, That all be with a Spirit of PIETY, and therefore very <hi>Prayerfully,</hi> carried on. 'Tis no more than what the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Intent</hi> of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:002772_0064_0FE62F216E816158"/>highly calls for. Firſt look up to Heaven, with Dependence upon a Glorious CHRIST, for His <hi>Influences</hi> and <hi>Aſſiſtences</hi> to carry you thro' what you have in Hand. Yea, Repeat the Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, with freſh <hi>Elevations of your Eyes</hi> to Him from whom <hi>comes all your Help,</hi> whenever you Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, after any Intermiſſion of your Study upon it: <hi>O my GOD and SAVIOUR, without Thee I can do nothing; Help me, Help me! Send forth thy Light and thy Truth unto me!</hi> This will be equivalent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Practice of ſuch Devout Men, as a <hi>Bradford</hi> and a <hi>Cartwright,</hi> Of whom they report, <hi>They ſtudied their Sermons on their Knees.</hi> And when you have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched a <hi>Paragraph</hi> of a Sermon, I wiſh it might be a frequent Practice with you, To make a <hi>Pauſe</hi> upon it; and <hi>get your Sermon by Heart,</hi> I mean, get your <hi>Heart ſuitably touched</hi> with what you have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, before you go any further, and caſt into the <hi>Mould</hi> of the <hi>Sanctifying Truths,</hi> by ſuch <hi>Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> and ſuch <hi>Petitions,</hi> as you may <hi>Dart</hi> up to Heaven upon them. At leaſt, let this be done, in your <hi>Peruſing</hi> of your <hi>Whole Sermon</hi> before your Preaching of it. Some celebrated Preachers have piouſly declared, <hi>They never durſt preach a Sermon to others, till they have got ſome good by it themſelves.</hi> To <hi>feel</hi> what you <hi>ſpeak,</hi> how wondrouſly will it qualify you to be a <hi>Lively Speaker!</hi> 'Twill bring you to deſerve the Title of a <hi>Rabbi Hadarſan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Be careful evermore to <hi>Preach Scripturally;</hi> and employ the <hi>Sword of the Spirit,</hi> if you would hope to do Execution. <hi>Pertinent Scriptures</hi> Demonſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Embelliſhing every Article, will well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one, who would <hi>Speak as the Oracles of GOD.</hi>
               <pb n="104" facs="unknown:002772_0065_0FE62F2172C39B00"/>For your Aid in this, I cannot but recommend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Uſe, <hi>Ravenellus,</hi> his <hi>Bibliotheca Sacra,</hi> as one of the moſt Uſeful Books in the World for a <hi>Preacher,</hi> that would at once have in one Regular, Orderly, Advantageous View, before him, the Sum of what the <hi>Scriptures</hi> have ſaid on every Subject: A Work, that is moreover full of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and Illuſtrations. There is alſo a Book Entituled, <hi>A Common Place Book to the Holy Bible;</hi> worth being always at Hand with you.</p>
            <p>It would be well, if you could likewiſe come to ſay with the Prophet, <hi>I have uſed Similitudes:</hi> And accuſtom yourſelf to find out <hi>Similitudes,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you may cloath your Ideas, and make them ſenſible to the loweſt and meaneſt Capacities, yea, to all <hi>Fleſh.</hi> Thus to <hi>ſeek out Acceptable Words,</hi> would render you a moſt <hi>Profitable</hi> as well as <hi>Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Preacher.</hi> It would marvellouſly <hi>faſten the Nails,</hi> and be ſome Imitation of the <hi>Preaching,</hi> which He that <hi>ſpake ſo as never Man ſpake,</hi> has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you a Pattern for.</p>
            <p>In your Preaching that you may <hi>Save them that hear you,</hi> I wiſh you may with all poſſible Dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſpread <hi>the Nets of Salvation</hi> for them. And therefore often exhibit the <hi>Terms of Salvation,</hi> and the Propoſals of the Goſpel, in ſuch a Manner, and ſo importunately ſolliciting their <hi>Conſent</hi> unto them, that by the hearty Speaking <hi>One Word,</hi> in the <hi>Echo's of Devotion</hi> thereupon, they may be brought into them. Exhibit unto them, the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of PIETY,</hi> in ſuch a Manner, that they muſt have their <hi>Hearts burn within</hi> them, &amp; they muſt be <hi>Hearts of Stone</hi> indeed, if they take not Fire immediately. When you alſo deſcribe the <hi>Graces of the New
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:002772_0065_0FE62F2172C39B00"/>Creature,</hi> give the Deſcription in the <hi>Language of PIETY,</hi> acting thoſe <hi>Graces;</hi> wherein, if they come into a <hi>Conſort</hi> with you, their Souls are gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto GOD, at the very Moment of your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing them. Oh! That you may be a <hi>Wiſe Winner of Souls!</hi> And while you are Preaching, may the Holy SPIRIT <hi>fall on them that hear the Word!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this Purpoſe I would have you uſually Try, as much as with <hi>Good Judgment</hi> you can, to ſet the <hi>Truths</hi> on <hi>Fire,</hi> before you part with any <hi>Head</hi> that you are upon; and let them come <hi>Flaming</hi> out of your Hand with Excitations to ſome <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion</hi> and <hi>Affection</hi> of Godlineſs, into the <hi>Hearts</hi> of thoſe whom they are addreſs'd unto. The <hi>Tongues</hi> with which the Holy SPIRIT made His Deſcent, on the firſt and beſt Preachers of the Goſpel that ever were in the World, were <hi>Flames,</hi> and had the Appearance of an <hi>Heavenly Fire</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
            <p>'Tis Pity but a <hi>Well prepared</hi> Sermon ſhould be a <hi>Well pronounced</hi> One.

Some Judicious Men have complained of the French <hi>Liturgy</hi> compoſed by the Excellent <hi>Calvin,</hi> for not having ſufficient Collects of <hi>Thankſgiving,</hi> but being all <hi>Petition.</hi> And whereas theſe three Things, <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> and <hi>Petition,</hi> and <hi>Thankſgiving</hi> belong to every <hi>complete Prayer,</hi> I have heard ſome enquire whether ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Rule, there can be readily found One <hi>complete Prayer,</hi> in another <hi>Liturgy,</hi> which I cannot commend unto you, for ſuch a <hi>Model of Perfection,</hi> as its admirers have eſteemed it.

               <q>It was a wretched Cuſtom of the Papiſts, that when they had run One of the <hi>Holy People</hi> into Priſon, they would there, by a progreſſive Subſtraction of all Subſiſtence from him, ſtarve him to Death. <hi>Matthias Dolanſcius</hi> was a Priſoner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for ſuch Circumſtances, in the City of

Now, One Day, when he was on the very point of <hi>Starving,</hi> he caſt his Eye towards the Grate of the Priſon, and ſaw a little Bird ſitting there, with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in his Bill. His Curioſity leading him thither, the Bird flew away: but left a bit of Cloth, in which, when he took it up, he found a piece of Gold: And with this piece of Gold, he found Ways tolleraby to furniſh himſelf with Bread, until the Death of the King: On and by which he obtained his full Deliverance.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This I will ſay to you; Hold on, Hold on, Always at Work for a Glorious CHRIST; and rather than you ſhould ſtarve, <hi>Matthias Dolanſcius</hi>'s Bird ſhall be ſent unto you! And unto that Queſtion, <hi>Lacked ye any thing?</hi> You ſhall be able to give a Comfortable Anſwer.</p>

<pb n="116" facs="unknown:002772_0071_0FE62F3CF40258A8"/>Important Matter. When the Lord GOD Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent comes to <hi>ſhake not the Earth only, but alſo Heaven,</hi> it is, That thoſe <hi>Things that cannot be ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en may remain.</hi> What are thoſe <hi>Things that cannot be ſhaken?</hi> But thoſe MAXIMS of the <hi>Everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> wherein all <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Wiſe</hi> Men are <hi>United,</hi> and all Men become <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Wiſe,</hi> when they come into that <hi>Union</hi> with them: The MAX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IMS, which the more they are <hi>ſtudied,</hi> and the <hi>Wiſer,</hi> and the <hi>Better,</hi> they are who ſtudy them, the more they will be approved of: The MAX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IMS which are directly calculated for the Grand Intentions of, <hi>Glory to GOD in the Higheſt,</hi> and <hi>Peace on Earth from a Good Will in Men towards one another.</hi> 'Tis even the <hi>Firſt born</hi> of my Wiſhes for you, That you may be one of thoſe <hi>Angels,</hi> that ſhall <hi>fly through the midſt of Heaven,</hi> with this <hi>Everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> to <hi>preach</hi> it unto them who <hi>dwell on the Earth,</hi> and move all the People of GOD, tho' of <hi>different Perſwaſions</hi> in <hi>leſſer Points,</hi> to embrace one another upon the <hi>Generous Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims</hi> of it, and keep <hi>leſſer Points</hi> in a due <hi>Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> unto the <hi>Superiour Maxims,</hi> and manage their <hi>Differences</hi> upon thoſe <hi>leſſer Points</hi> with another Spirit, than what the <hi>Diſputers of this World</hi> in the ſeveral <hi>Sects</hi> of Chriſtians keep commonly <hi>Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> One another withal.</p>

            <p>I will not now ſuppoſe a <hi>Quinquarticular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy,</hi> but rather propoſe a <hi>Ternarticular Period of all Controverſies.</hi> And the very firſt Thing, that I offer upon it, is, That in theſe MAXIMS, <hi>of Godlineſs,</hi> which are all <hi>without Controverſy,</hi> you behold all <hi>Controverſies</hi> of Religion, as coming to an Amicable and a Comfortable Period. My Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to you, is; That when you make ſome Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure in the Field of the <hi>Church-Militant,</hi> you be drawn as little as may be, into any <hi>Eriſtic Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;</hi> wherein you ſhall be ſurprized unawares
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:002772_0073_0FE62F3EB35FCF48"/>into the Errors of <hi>Paſſion,</hi> and into the <hi>Follies</hi> of taking Pains to convince a few Readers that you have more <hi>Wit</hi> than your Antagoniſt. Every Man who pulls at the <hi>Polemic Saw,</hi> and manages any <hi>Controverſy</hi> in Religion, always pretends a <hi>Zeal</hi> to uphold in the <hi>Iſſue</hi> of the Diſputation, ſome certain Point of <hi>Practical</hi> PIETY, which is in theſe Indiſputable MAXIMS declared for. If it were not from a <hi>zealous Concern</hi> which the Contenders have that the <hi>Practice of Piety,</hi> may not ſuffer in ſuch a Point, they profeſs, that they would not <hi>contend ſo earneſtly for the Faith.</hi> If they can't ſincerely make this Profeſſion, they are but <hi>Litigious,</hi> and <hi>Vexatious,</hi> and the <hi>Gladiators</hi> are to be hiſs'd off the <hi>Theatre,</hi> by all that wiſh well to Chriſtianity. Now, how commonly are <hi>both Parties</hi> well agreed, in the Point of PIETY, which the One ſays, can't be preſerved but upon <hi>his Poſitions;</hi> and the other ſays, can't be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved if <hi>his</hi> be denied? Be ſure, All the <hi>Truly Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> are ſo! But, if <hi>both Parties</hi> are agreed for that PIETY, which is the Main, and the Scope of all, how much Good may you do, if you can ſo Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe the <hi>Odoriferous Water</hi> of the confeſſed MAX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IMS upon them, that the <hi>Quarrelling Hives</hi> in the Loſs of their Diſtinction may give over their Quarrels, and the Children of <hi>Jacob</hi> not <hi>fall out by the Way,</hi> or be ſo angry about the Way, <hi>ſeeing they are Brethren?</hi> Or, if the <hi>Brethren</hi> will yet <hi>fall out,</hi> and the <hi>Controverſies</hi> muſt <hi>go on,</hi> and you are called forth to bear a Part in them, yet, <hi>My Son,</hi> continue to play theſe <hi>Engines,</hi> for the extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Fires;</hi> Govern your <hi>Mind,</hi> and your <hi>Pen,</hi> by the MAXIMS of PIETY; perſwade
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:002772_0073_0FE62F3EB35FCF48"/>others what you can to do ſo too; and carry not on any but the <hi>Wars of the Lamb</hi> in your Conteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. What I could moſt of all wiſh for is, That for your <hi>Defence</hi> of the <hi>Truth,</hi> which is always for PIETY, you do what you have to do, moſtly in that <hi>Poſitive Way,</hi> of aſſerting, and evincing, and advancing the PIETY, which the <hi>Truth</hi> you would have to be defended, is to animate. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> will quickly come in, with a Teſtimony on the behalf of that PIETY; and the Truth which appears neceſſary to ſupport that PIETY, will eaſily be taken in, and not eaſily parted with. This is for the moſt part better than the <hi>Elenctic Way</hi> of ſheltering the Truth from the Aſſaults which they that <hi>corrupt the Earth</hi> would make up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it: Inſtead of <hi>Swords,</hi> it is to employ <hi>Plough-Shares;</hi> Inſtead of <hi>Spears,</hi> it is to employ <hi>Pruning-Hooks;</hi> and the State and Work of <hi>Paradiſe</hi> is a little emulated and anticipated.</p>
            <p>But, if the <hi>Elenctic Way</hi> become neceſſary to be taken, and if you muſt <hi>go down into the Battel,</hi> and ſmite the Enemies in the <hi>Valley of Salt,</hi> I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and again ſay, <hi>Take heed unto your Spirit:</hi> Let the Deſigns of PIETY Regulate your whole Proceeding. Furniſh no new Matter for the old Complaint of, — <hi>Sibi ferales plerique Chriſtiani;</hi> and add nothing to the Inſtances of ſuch Outrages, as the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> have with Deriſion cenſured in the <hi>Controverſal Writings</hi> of the mutual Firings between the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and the <hi>Calviniſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts!</hi> — Inaſmuch as I have thus unawares mentioned Theſe, I will up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe make the <hi>Experiment,</hi> [whether with any
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:002772_0074_0FE62F48B5046EF8"/>better Succeſs, than my dear <hi>Pitiſcus</hi> did, I know not!] how far a <hi>Syneretiſm</hi> of PIETY will <hi>Unite</hi> the People of GOD, or <hi>Abate</hi> their <hi>Curſed Anger,</hi> and <hi>Cruel Wrath</hi> againſt One another in purſuing of <hi>Religious Controverſies.</hi> The Sagacious Baron <hi>Puſſendorf,</hi> while he deſpairs not of breaking down the <hi>Partition Wall</hi> between thoſe two mighty Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> in other Parts of it, yet it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears unto him little ſhort of Deſperate, when the Sublime and Obſcure Doctrines of <hi>Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (wherein <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> themſelves, were better agreed than their Followers,) come to be conſidered. However, even here alſo at laſt he takes Courage, and ſays, <hi>If ever there is to be a Better Condition of Mankind, and an Happier State of the World, it is not to be Expected, but from a ſerious and univerſal Practice of Chriſtian PIETY.</hi> Let us then with a little Patience hear both Parties de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare themſelves.</p>
            <p>Say, Maſter <hi>Lutheran,</hi> What is the PIETY, for the maintaining whereof you ſo eagerly advance your <hi>Principles?</hi> His Anſwer is; <q>I would not have the moſt <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Sin-hating</hi> Lord, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached as the <hi>Impeller</hi> of the <hi>Sin</hi> whereof he is the <hi>Revenger.</hi> I would not have our <hi>Merciful</hi> Father blaſphemed, as dealing <hi>after an Illuſory Manner</hi> with Men, when He invites them to His <hi>Mercy.</hi> I would not have any among the fallen Race of the <hi>Firſt Adam,</hi> ſhut out from the juſt Hopes of <hi>Life</hi> in the <hi>Death</hi> of the <hi>Second A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi> I would not have <hi>Impenitent Unbeliever;</hi> caſt upon GOD the <hi>Blame</hi> of their <hi>Impenitency;</hi> but the Wicked lay wholly <hi>on themſelves</hi> the
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:002772_0074_0FE62F48B5046EF8"/>Fault of their own Deſtruction. I would have Men <hi>Work about their own Salvation,</hi> with a much Diligence and Vigilance, as if all turned upon their own <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Care</hi> whether they ſhall be Saved or no.</q> The pious <hi>Calviniſt</hi> hears all this with Pleaſure; and can ſay, <hi>My Brother, In all theſe Things my Heart is with you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now, Maſter <hi>Calviniſt,</hi> it is your Turn. Say, what is the PIETY, for the maintaining whereof you ſo eagerly Prefer your <hi>Principles?</hi> His Anſwer is; <q>I would have our good GOD, forever adored, as the <hi>Original</hi> of all the <hi>Good,</hi> that we <hi>Have,</hi> or that we <hi>Do.</hi> If Men arrive to any Good <hi>Spiritual</hi> as well as <hi>Temporal,</hi> I would have our GOD praiſed for it; and I would have His <hi>Favours</hi> confeſſed as moſt <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merited</hi> by us in all our <hi>Praiſes.</hi> I would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the leaſt Inſinuation, as if the <hi>King Eternal,</hi> who is the <hi>Only Wiſe GOD,</hi> had not an Infallible <hi>Foreknowledge</hi> from all Eternity of whatever comes to paſs in Time. I would have all that come unto <hi>Everlaſting Life,</hi> to admire the <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Love</hi> of GOD unto them; and with Endleſs Admirations own, <hi>That their SAVIOUR has done more for them, than for others.</hi> I would have Men look up to GOD, with ardent <hi>Prayers</hi> for His Gracious, and Enlightening, and Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying Influences, and <hi>Pray</hi> unto Him as the <hi>GOD of all Grace,</hi> and the GOD who <hi>gives Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> and Remember that <hi>Faith</hi> is the <hi>Gift of GOD.</hi> I would have Man to be very Humble, and humbly to Annihilate himſelf before the Glorious GOD, <hi>with whom there is terrible Majeſty.</hi>
               </q>
               <pb n="124" facs="unknown:002772_0075_0FE62F48B9BEA378"/>The pious <hi>Lutheran</hi> hears all this with Delight; and can ſay, <hi>My Brother, My Heart cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with you, in ſuch Things as theſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the ſame time, they both find that the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Schemes,</hi> with which they would have this PI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ETY ſerved, are encumbred with <hi>Inſuperable Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties;</hi> and the <hi>Lutheran</hi> may have retorted upon him thoſe very <hi>Difficulties</hi> which he thinks he ſees the <hi>Calviniſt</hi> overwhelmed withal. The old Law, <hi>Qui non vetat cum poteſt Jubet,</hi> Encumbers <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> with as <hi>hard Conſequences</hi> as he charges on <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marus. Maimonides</hi> will tell you, how much the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> World, and <hi>Cicero</hi> how much the <hi>Pagan,</hi> has been divided, in their Opinions, <hi>De Fato.</hi> Among the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> how do the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> and after theſe, the <hi>Janſeniſts,</hi> and their Oppoſites, keep <hi>in the dark, buffeting</hi> one another upon them? So that after all, Tis PIETY that muſt bring all to rights: and <hi>Melancthons</hi> Reſolution; <hi>Officium agamus, et Diſputationes de Predeſtinatione ſeponamus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Experiment may be made on many other Doctrines, [Among which, I pray, take notice, you'l never find me mentioning the <hi>Damnable Hereſies,</hi> of the <hi>Arian,</hi> and the <hi>Socinian!</hi>] wherein they that have the true <hi>Fear</hi> of GOD, and <hi>Love</hi> of CHRIST, may have their <hi>Differing Sentiments;</hi> — <hi>Incolumi ſemper Amicitia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Inſtead of my going on to do That, I rather paſs now to ſay, That I would have you lay aſide all Thoughts, of any <hi>Foundation</hi> for an <hi>Union</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, but what ſhall be in the <hi>Unity of the Spirit;</hi> or that Work of the Holy SPIRIT on the Hearts of Men, that
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:002772_0075_0FE62F48B9BEA378"/>inclines them to Glorify GOD with an <hi>Obedience</hi> to His Will revealed in His Word, and Glorify CHRIST with a <hi>Dependence</hi> on Him for all their Happineſs; and <hi>Love their Neighbour as themſelves. Other Foundation can no Man lay!</hi> All Attempts to build the <hi>Tower of Zion</hi> on any other Foundation, will come to nothing; You'l proſper no better in them, than they who go to build a <hi>Tower of Babel.</hi> But then, Let ALL that are by Viſible PIETY qualified for it, find a due and a kind Reception with you. Let your <hi>Feet ſtand in a large Place,</hi> and, <hi>Add unto your Faith, Godlineſs, and unto your Godlineſs, Brotherly-kindneſs, and unto your Brotherly-kindneſs, Charity:</hi> And, Pay the Regards of <hi>Brethren in CHRIST,</hi> unto all thoſe, who by owning and living the Everlaſting MAXIMS of PIETY, may claim what the true Citizen of <hi>Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> will yield unto <hi>them that Fear the Lord.</hi> Allow to, yea, Challenge for, this People, the <hi>Rights</hi> which belong unto them, and the <hi>Liberties</hi> with which the SON of GOD has <hi>made them free.</hi> The People, <hi>who Worſhip GOD in the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>who Rejoyce in CHRIST JESUS,</hi> and who <hi>have no Confidence in the Fleſh,</hi> or, value not themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>Religion</hi> which is nothing but <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour; THESE are the true <hi>People of GOD:</hi> The PEOPLE, which have the <hi>Promiſes</hi> in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of GOD pertaining to them; and whereto the <hi>Kindneſſes,</hi> or the <hi>Injuries</hi> that are done, are done unto their Glorious <hi>Head,</hi> in the Heavens. Be not ſuch a <hi>Donatiſt,</hi> as to dream, that the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of GOD</hi> are no where to be found, but in <hi>One Party,</hi> which you have your greateſt Eſteem for.

            <p>Challenge for this <hi>People,</hi> a Power to <hi>Aſſociate,</hi> or form <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> for the Worſhip of GOD our SAVIOUR, according to the <hi>Directions</hi> which they apprehend his Goſpel has given them.

Churches that will keep up <hi>Inſtruments of Separation,</hi> which will keep out thoſe that have the Evident <hi>Marks</hi> and <hi>Claims</hi> of them that are <hi>One with CHRIST</hi> upon them, are in Reality but <hi>Combinations</hi> of Men, who under Pretence of <hi>Religion,</hi> are purſuing ſome <hi>Carnal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts.</hi> Their <hi>Diana</hi> is very <hi>Viſible!</hi> Tis a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated <hi>Profanity</hi> and <hi>Hypocriſy,</hi> that theſe <hi>Churches</hi> are to ſtand indicted for.

            <p>But if I am againſt your taking <hi>Tobacco</hi> in <hi>Smoke,</hi> you may be ſure, I ſhall not approve your taking it in <hi>Snuff.</hi> How <hi>ſhameful</hi> a thing it is, for <hi>People of Reaſon</hi> to confeſs, that they can't live eaſily half an Hour together, without a <hi>Delight</hi> ſo Senſual, ſo Trivial, ſo very Contemptible, as that of <hi>Tickling their Olfactory Nerves</hi> a little?

I ſhall not ſay, how much it has <hi>coſt</hi> me, and what a <hi>Dear-bought Experience</hi> it is, that has enabled me to recommend them.</p>
            <p>I will firſt ſuppoſe, That you take that Courſe of PIETY, <hi>If any lack Wiſdom, let him ask it of GOD:</hi> And, That you ſtudy the Book of <hi>The PROVERBS,</hi> which our Bible is enriched withal. I will alſo wiſh you to read, the Lord <hi>Verulam,</hi> his <hi>Eſſays.</hi> And I will mind you, That one has lately written a Book, to ſhow, <hi>That Wiſdom lies in the not doing that which may any way prejudice Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society, of which we are a part, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary make all our Actions tend to the Benefit of it.</hi> Then, I will offer you ſuch <hi>Hints</hi> as theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The <hi>Italian</hi> Maxims are no <hi>Imprudent</hi> ones. One muſt not <hi>Spend all he hath;</hi> nor <hi>Do all he can;</hi> nor <hi>Tell all he knows;</hi> nor <hi>Believe all he hears.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there is a Sentence of a <hi>Greek</hi> Poet, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be remembred with you; which in plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> will tell you, <hi>No wiſe Man will be taken a ſecond Time, in an Error he hath ſuffered for.</hi>

<pb n="138" facs="unknown:002772_0082_0FE62F694AFA8048"/>you <hi>Speak; Think</hi> before <hi>whom</hi> you Speak; Think <hi>why</hi> as well as <hi>what</hi> you Speak. And Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, <hi>In multiloquio Stultiloquium;</hi> And, <hi>Leaſt ſaid ſooneſt mended.</hi>

            <p n="8">VIII. Sometimes a <hi>Vindication</hi> may be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

Let them that have abuſed you, <hi>know nothing</hi> that you <hi>know any thing</hi> of the matter.
