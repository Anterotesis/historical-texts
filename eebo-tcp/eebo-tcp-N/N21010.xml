            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>GEORGE, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> FORASMUCHAS it is humbly meant and complained to us, by our right truſty ROBERT DUNDAS, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of Arniſton, our Advocate, for our intereſt upon MAURICE MARGAROT, merchant in Marybon, London, No. 10, High-ſtreet, reſiding or lately reſiding, at the Black Bull Inn, head of Leith Walk, pariſh of St. Cuthbert's, and County of Edinburgh: THAT WHEREAS, by the laws of this, and of every well governed realm, SEDITION is a crime of an heinous nature, and ſeverely puniſhable, YET TRUE IT IS, AND OF VERITY, That the ſame Maurice Margarot has preſumed to commit, and is guilty actor, or art and part of ſaid crime: IN SO FAR AS, the ſaid Maurice Margarot having been named a delegate by an aſſociation of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious people, calling themſelves the Correſponding Society of London, did repair to Edinburgh with the wicked and felonious purpoſe of joining and co-operating with an illegal aſſociation of evil diſpoſed and ſeditious perſons, who originally deſigned themſelves, The General Convention of the friends of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but who have of late aſſumed the deſignation of <q>the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Convention of the delegates of the people, aſſociated to obtain univerſal ſuffrage and annual parliaments;</q> and which illegal aſſociation, under the names and deſignations above mentioned, have been in the practice, during the months of October and November laſt, as well as in the beginning of the preſent month of December, 1793, of holding various ſeditious and illegal meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at a Maſon's lodge, or room in Black-fryars wynd, in the city of Edinburgh, and elſewhere, to the public proſecutor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known; and which meetings, though held under pretence of procuring a reform in parliament, were evidently of a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and deſtructive tendency, with a deliberate and determined intention, to diſturb the peace of the community, and to ſubvert the preſent conſtitution of the country: with which view they imitated, both in the form and tenor of their proceedings, that Convention of people, the avowed enemies of this country, who at preſent uſurp the government of France, and with whom Great-Britain then was and ſtill is at war: That the ſaid Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:027594_0004_0FD54D2862708740"/>
Margarot, from his arrival in Edinburgh, did, as a delegate from the ſaid Correſponding Society, in London, conſtantly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the illegal meetings of the above mentioned aſſociation, and did co-operate with them, on different occaſions, and act as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or chairman of their meetings, and did take an active and diſtinguiſhed part in their deliberations and proceedings; and that while the ſaid Maurice Margarot continued to attend the ſaid illegal meetings, as a delegate, or was officiating in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of preſident, as above mentioned, various ſeditious and inflammatory votes and reſolutions were paſſed, ſome of which he moved, others of which he ſeconded, and to all of which he gave his concurrence and approbation, by voting for paſſing the ſame; and which ſeditions votes and reſolutions, as alſo the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory ſpeeches that were delivered on thoſe occaſions, by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the ſaid meetings, were inſerted in minutes of their procedure, taken at the time, and which afterwards by their order, or under their authority, were publiſhed in a newſpaper, called the Edinburgh Gazetteer, of Tueſday, November 26th, 1793, being No. 78; of Tueſday, December 3d, 1793, being No. 79; and of Tueſday, December the 10th, 1793, being No. 80, all of that paper; and were by that means circulated among the lieges; That the ſaid Maurice Margarot did alſo, when attending in his capacity of delegate at the illegal meetings of the ſaid aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, utter and make various ſeditious and inflammatory ſpeeches, tending to vilify our preſent happy conſtitution, and to withdraw therefrom the confidence and attachment of our ſubjects; and did likewiſe move reſolutions, tending to diſſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the ſeditious and unconſtitutional principles, by which theſe meetings were actuated. And particularly the ſaid Maurice Margarot, at a meeting of the ſaid Convention, held on Tueſday 19th of November laſt, 1793, or on ſome other day of that month, in a Maſon lodge, or room in Black-fryars wynd, in the city of Edinburgh, did wickedly and feloniouſly make the following mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or one of a ſimilar import; <q>That previous to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing an addreſs to the public, a Committee be forthwith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, to conſider the means and draw up the outlines of a plan of general union and corporation between the two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in their conſtitutional purſuit of a thorough parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary reform.</q> Which motion, or one of the ſame tendency, having been approved of, was paſſed unanimouſly by the ſaid illegal aſſociation; and which motion clearly demonſtrated a wiſh and intention, on the part of the ſaid Maurice Margarot, of propagating the ſeditious tenets of that aſſociation over the whole kingdom, and of exciting our ſubjects in England, in contempt of legal authority, to adopt the ſame unconſtitutional conduct which the ſaid Maurice Margarot and his aſſociates had preſumed to follow.</p>
            <p>And further, on Monday, the 25th of November 1793, or on ſome other day of that month, another illegal meeting, of the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:027594_0005_0FD54D2B17C0CF80"/>
above-named aſſociation, held at the aforeſaid Maſon lodge or room, in Black-fryars wind, or in ſome other place to the public proſecutor unknown; upon a motion being made in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, or words of the ſame import: <q>That in caſe the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, or any other member, bring into the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons a motion for a Convention Bill, as paſſed in Ireland, for preventing the people from meeting according to their juſt rights by the revolution, the ſame motion ſhall be noticed to the delegates of the reſpective ſocieties immediately to meet in Convention, to aſſert their rights;</q> which motion having become the ſubject of conſideration the following day, the ſaid Maurice Margarot did then wickedly and feloniouſly utter and make the following ſpeech, or one of the like import and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency: <q>This is an excellent motion, and the event, which it alludes to, ought to be the <hi>tocſin</hi> to the friends of liberty to aſſemble. It ſeems however to be imperfect: it does not mention any place of meeting, neither does it ſpecify the time when the delegates are to aſſemble; for the word immediately is indefinite, and will not convey the ſame meaning to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons reſiding in different parts of the country. By thoſe who live near to the place of meeting it will be underſtood, that they are to repair there next day. By thoſe at a greater diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, within a few days; and by thoſe ſtill further off, a week after ſuch information is received. But the Committee of regulations have in their report an article of the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, which, in my opinion, is preferable to our friend Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar's motion; which, as this motion comes properly under the charge of regulations, I wiſh that it were referred to that committee. I therefore move that the report be read, that the Convention may judge whether the article I allude to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently provides for the intention of the motion now before the Convention.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I believe that the Convention will be convinced, that the clauſe of the report of the Committee of regulations compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the ſpirit and intention of <hi>Citizen</hi> Callendar's motion, and alſo extends farther, inaſmuch as it provides for a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of caſes equally dangerous to liberty, as a Convention Bill; it will be found alſo, that this buſineſs of calling a meeting of the Convention had better be entruſted to a ſelect Committee, appointed for the particular purpoſe of watching every act which may militate againſt the rights of the people. And I maintain that the proper place for this motion to appear is among the regulations of the Convention.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And further, on the 28th day of the ſaid month of November, 1793, or upon one or other of the days above mentioned, the ſaid illegal and ſeditious meeting did, after diſcuſſion of the ſaid motion, in the room or Maſon lodge in Black-fryars wynd afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, wickedly and ſeditiouſly come to the reſolution of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing import and tenor: <q>That this Convention conſidering
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:027594_0006_0FD9B83288EBCC58"/>
the calamitous conſequences of any act of the legiſlature which may tend to deprive the whole or any part of the people of their undoubted right to meet, either by themſelves, or by delegation, to diſcuſs any matter relative to their common intereſt, whether of a public or private nature; and holding the ſame to be totally inconſiſtent with the firſt principles and ſafety of ſociety, and alſo ſubverſive of our known and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged conſtitutional liberties, do hereby declare, before God and the World, that we ſhall follow the wholeſome example of former times, by paying no regard to any act which ſhall militate againſt the conſtitution of our Country, and ſhall continue to aſſemble and conſider of the beſt means by which we can accompliſh a real repreſentation of the people and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual election, until compelled to deſiſt by ſuperior force.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>And we do reſolve,</p>
               <p>That the firſt notice given for the introduction of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention Bill, or any Bill of a ſimilar tendency to that paſſed in Ireland in the laſt Seſſion of Parliament;</p>
               <p>Or any Bill for the ſuſpenſion of the <hi>Habeas Corpus Act,</hi> or the act for preventing wrongous impriſonment, and againſt undue delays in trials in North Britain;</p>
               <p>Or in caſe of an Invaſion,</p>

               <p>The Convention doth therefore reſolve, that each delegate, immediately upon his return home, do convene his conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents and explain to them the neceſſity of electing a delegate or delegates, and of eſtabliſhing a fund without delay againſt any of theſe emergencies, for his or their expence, and that they do inſtruct the ſaid delegate or delegates to hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ready to depart at one hour's warning.</p>

This letter ſhall be delivered unopened to his conſtituents, the receipt of which ſhall be acknowledged by a letter to the ſecretary, preſerved in the ſame ſtate until the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod

ſhall arrive at which it ſhall be deemed neceſſary for the delegate to ſet off—which motion was unanimouſly approved of.—</p>

            <p>And further, the ſaid Maurice Margarot did, on Wedneſday the 4th of December, 1793, or on one or other of the days of that month, or November preceding, in another illegal meeting of the above-named Aſſociation, held at the aforeſaid Maſon Lodge, or room in blackfryar's-wynd, or ſome other place to the public Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor unknown, wickedly and feloniouſly utter and make the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſpeech, or one of a ſimilar import and tendency:</p>

However I ſhall in the mean time obſerve, that I am informed there are many men who are deſirous of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſing us by force, we ought therefore to prepare againſt ſuch diſperſion. We have already appointed a ſecret commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, for fixing a place of meeting on certain emergencies: and we ought to be equally well provided againſt the preſent caſe; for if we ſhall happen to be diſperſed to night, how or where are we to rally again? To do this your Committee ſuggeſts a reſolution to the following effect; but which I ſhall leave to be drawn up by the Council of the table: That the moment of any illegal diſperſion of the preſent Convention ſhall be conſidered as a ſummons to the Delegates to repair to the place of meeting, appointed for the Convention of Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency by the ſecret committee; and that the ſecret committee is inſtructed to proceed without delay to fix the place of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I hope that what has been already ſaid will convince the Convention that your Committee of Regulations, though they have not been able to bring forward their report, have not neglected their duty; and it will convince our enemies that we do not altogether neglect them, they will ſee that we proceed with regularity, and that we have an eye upon them while they have ſpies upon us. I therefore move for leave to bring in this motion—Which motion afterward paſſed unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly.</q>

—The ſaid Maurice Margarot, after moving the ſaid reſolution, not only gave his aſſent to paſs the ſame, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed himſelf to be named one of the four members of which ſaid ſecret Committee was compoſed, and agreed to act in that capacity. And further, on Friday, December 6th, 1793, or ſome other day of that month, the ſaid illegal aſſociation having again aſſembled in a room or workſhop belonging to, or poſſeſſed by John Laing, wright, ſituated in Lady Lawſon's yard, ſouth ſide of Croſs Cauſeway, in the pariſh of St. Cuthbert and ſheriffdom of Edinburgh; the Sheriff Subſtitute of Edinburgh, with others his aſſiſtants, having, in the diſcharge of his duty, repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſaid room or workſhop, with a view to diſperſe ſaid il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal Aſſociation, the ſaid Maurice Margarot, with others his aſſociates, did then and there reſiſt the ſaid Sheriff Subſtitute, and did peremptorily refuſe to diſperſe until forced ſo to do: that on this occaſion the ſaid Maurice Margarot was called to the chair, and acted as preſes or chairman of the ſaid illegal meeting after the appearance of the Sheriff Subſtitute; and, in open con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and defiance of all legal authority, vindicated the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the meeting, and peremptorily refuſed to leave the chair unleſs compulſion was uſed: in conſequence of which the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff Subſtitute was under the neceſſity of taking him by the arm and pulling him out of the chair, and of uſing force in diſperſing the reſt of his aſſociates: That this conduct of the ſaid Maurice Margarot was highly aggravated by this circumſtance: That the ſaid illegal aſſociation had been the very evening before diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed by the civil magiſtrate. And the ſaid Maurice Margarot having been apprehended and brought before Harry Davidſon, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Sheriff Subſtitute of the ſhire of Edinburgh, on the 5th of December, 1793, did in his preſence emit a declaration of that date, which is ſigned by the ſaid Sheriff Subſtitute, the ſaid Maurice Margarot having declined to ſign the ſame; and when the ſaid Maurice Margarot had been ſo apprehended, ſundry papers hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been found in his poſſeſſion, or claimed by him, the ſame were afterwards inſpected in his preſence, by authority of the Sheriff of Edinburgh, and two ſeveral liſts or inventories of thoſe papers were made up, one of which, containing ten articles, is ſubſcribed by William Scott, procurator fiſcal of the county of Edinburgh, and by Joſeph Gerrald, of Hart-ſtreet, Bloomſbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Square, London; and the other, conſiſting of nine articles, is ſubſcribed by the ſaid William Scott, and by the Sheriff Subſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Edinburgh, as the ſaid Maurice Margarot refuſed to ſign the ſame.

               <p>Clerk of the Court, where is the Lord Juſtice General of Scotland? I don't ſee him in his place.</p>

            <sp>

               <speaker>Mr. Margarot.</speaker>
               <p> I hold that this Court is not competent to try me. My Lords, I am cited before the Lord Juſtice General of Scotland, the Lord Juſtice Clerk, and Lords Commiſſioners of Juſticiary. Now we know this is the higheſt court in Scotland: we know there is no higher office in Scotland, than that of Lord Juſtice General, and we know, that if it was an unneceſſary poſt, it would not have £.2,000 a year ſalary, annexed to it, and we know that the indictment would have run before our Lord Juſtice General, or Lord Juſtice Clerk, becauſe we know that the Public Proſecutor will in this caſe and in every other, trumpet up much the conſtitution; and as the conſtitution of Great Britain is founded upon Laws, and thoſe Laws can only be delivered in words, ſo the leaſt variation of words in a Law, is a total ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to an indictment. My Lords, it may be ſaid there is precedent for it; but it is a fundamental principle, that no man is to hold out his own laches. Why is he not here to do his duty? If this innovation is ſuffered, perhaps the attendance of the Lord Juſtice Clerk will be diſpenſed with, and the attendance of the other Judges; and at laſt, perhaps, the Clerk of the Court, or even the Macers, will form the high Court of Juſticiary, ſo that by one deviation and another, even the forms of juſtice will be done away; and, my Lords, we cannot ſay that there has not been a precedent, where the Lord Juſtice General has appeared in his place, though perhaps that was not to the honour of Scotland, where the Duke of Argyle ſat as Lord Juſtice General, for the purpoſe of trying a man, one James Stewart, for the murder of a man of the name of Campbell, and the whole jury were Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells except two; and that was the only inſtance where the Scotch have enjoyed the privilege of having the Lord Juſtice General ſit in their Court. I deny even the competency of this Court to argue upon, or maintain their own competency, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the ſervant pretending to dictate to the maſter. As
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:027594_0013_0FD9B855C1039138"/>
well may it be ſaid, we don't want a King, as for the Lord Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice Clerk to ſay, we don't want a Lord Juſtice General.</p>
               <p>I have met the laws, and I beg this may be taken under your ſerious conſideration, for what I ſay this day will not be confined within theſe walls, it ſhall ſpread far and wide, and will undergo a reviſion of both Houſes of Parliament in England. You al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready know that there is an impeachment hanging over your heads—you know it is ſhortly promiſed to be brought forward. And, my Lords, I object upon another ground, in the criminality of which you are all implicated, for there is this difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the lieges and the judges, that a man is always preſumed innocent till he is found guilty; but the moment there is the ſlighteſt imputation upon a judge, he is preſumed to be criminal till his innocence is clearly proved. A judge ought to be like Caeſar's wife, nor only ſpotleſs but even unſuſpected: that is not the caſe with you, my Lords. We have the promiſe of many men in England of great reſpectability who will bring it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and you may, though you are now ſitting upon that bench, be brought to atone upon your knees, perhaps with your lives, for any infraction of the Laws you may be guilty of. My Lords, we well know that Cambyſes ordered an unjuſt judge to be flea'd, and the ſkin of that judge covered the ſeat of his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor. We alſo know, that in the reign of Alfred (and I hold my authority in my hand, and the hiſtory of England will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it to every one) that in one year, forty-four judges were hanged—and you well know the fate of Jefferys, who, though the ſlow hand of the law could not overtake him, was torn in pieces by the people. I don't mean to ſay that you are guilty— that remains for a higher deciſion than mine, at that tribunal where you muſt ſoon appear, to anſwer for thoſe actions which you have committed; but you will remember, that there will be at that day a mixture of guilt and innocence—may the innocence appear predominant—I don't wiſh to be one of your accuſers on that day.</p>
               <p>My Lords, the objection that I have ſtated, it is impoſſible to get over, for that man is remarkably accurate, I mean the public Proſecutor, and if it was not neceſſary, he would not have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted it. I expect no mercy from him, neither ſhall I expect any thing like mercy from the court, in the ſituation in which I ſtand, if what I have heard be true.</p>
               <p>My Lords, there is another objection alſo—I need Lord Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice Clerk and Lord Henderland's teſtimonies, as exculpatory evidences: I wanted to bring them upon their oaths to the bar, but though it is the privilege of an Engliſhman—of a Briton I mean, for I wiſh the name of Engliſhman to be annihilated in that of Briton—it is a privilege granted to us by that Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which is ſo loudly trumpeted up upon every occaſion), that a pannel at the bar, ſhall have the ſame compulſory method of bringing his witneſſes that his proſecutor has, and that has
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:027594_0014_0FD9B85CDCA18760"/>
been denied me. The man whoſe buſineſs it is to cite witneſſes ſaid, he would attend in court, and give his reaſons why he did not dare to ſerve thoſe judges with a citation. It is true, I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned only the Lord Juſtice Clerk to him, and I charged him to tell the Lord Juſtice Clerk that I wanted his evidence, and I apprehend that you are not competent to determine upon this objection. I have obeyed the laws. This is not the high Court of Juſticiary, inaſamuch as it lacks the centre ſtone—inaſmuch as it lacks the principal officer of the court, and the man who here ſhould repreſent the King, and conſequently the wording of the indictment is looſe, and renders it null and void. I have done my duty, and I demand to be diſcharged from your bar ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliciter.</p>

               <p> My Lords, the objection as I underſtand it, is, that the Lord Juſtice General does not attend this court, and it is even ſaid, that we are not competent to judge of the force and validity of that objection. Why, my Lord, with reſpect to that, if we are not competent to judge of it, who is to judge of it? It is from the neceſſity of things that we muſt judge of it— no other perſon can judge of it, and therefore I hold that objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be null and void. With reſpect to the attendance of the Lord Juſtice General—by Act of Parliament it is declared, that any three of this court ſhall be a quorum to try any criminal; conſequently, though my Lord Juſtice General is abſent, and even if your Lordſhips and I were abſent, any other members of the court provided there are three, is a legal quorum ſufficient for the trial; therefore I am of opinion that the objection ſhould be repelled.</p>

               <p> With regard to the libel, if any exactneſs is neceſſary in a criminal libel, it certainly is not relevant, and here is one thing, that alone is ſufficient to quaſh it. But, my Lord, I deſired that my witneſſes might be called over, in order that I might have a fair and free trial, that if any of them did not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, I might have a caption granted by the court; and that is an objection which is not to be done away ſo eaſily. I have not heard the anſwer of the court to that.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Juſtice Clerk.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Margarot.</speaker>
               <p> If your Lordſhips will give me leave to ſtate the objection about the witneſſes afterwards, then I ſay, this libel ſtates, that by the Laws of this Realm, Sedition is a crime of a heinous nature. I beſeech your Lordſhip, to point out the Law which makes Sedition a crime, and alſo, that which ſhews the puniſhment that is due to it. I underſtand that ſome people think Sedition ſo well underſtood, as not to need explanation. I differ from them—I ſay it is not merely the authority of a judge that is ſufficient—he muſt lay his finger upon the Law Book and point it out to the Subjects, that they may know where to find it when they are not before the judge. Is there any Law in the Britiſh Conſtitution, which points out Sedition, and affixes the puniſhment to it?</p>
               <p>My Lords, in page three of the indictment are theſe words, which I underſtand to be taken from the Gazetteer. This is an excellent motion, and the event which it alludes to, ought to be the tocſin to the friends of liberty to aſſemble. In the Gazetteer it is, the friends <hi>to</hi> liberty—here it is the friends <hi>of</hi> liberty. Therefore, that <hi>is</hi> a flaw in the indictment, which quaſhes it at once.</p>
               <p>My Lords, if you go according to juſtice, theſe are valid objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but if you think proper to repel them—if it is only to ſtate an objection, and as ſoon as ſtated it is repelled, you may
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:027594_0016_0FD9B85E106C29A0"/>
do as you think fit; but, if I have not impartial juſtice done me, I will ſit down, not make any defence, but deſire you to diſband the jury, and paſs ſentence.</p>

               <speaker>Lord Juſtice Clerk.</speaker>
               <p> Have you any thing further to ſay as to the relevancy?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Margarot.</speaker>
               <p> It is irrelevant in toto. Then, my Lords, again, at the concluſion of this libel I come back with my firſt objection —I ſee at the beginning and the end, and it is not a mere matter of form—no Act of Parliament can do it away, or if an Act of Parliament can do it away, why is not the Letter, as well as the Spirit of the Act maintained. It ſays here, all which, or part thereof, being found proven by the verdict of an aſſize be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Lord Juſtice General, Lord Juſtice Clerk, and Lords Commiſſioners of Juſticiary. It ſays ſo at the beginning—it ſays ſo at the end. My Lords, this is an inaccuracy that cannot be overlooked, it muſt not be overlooked; and, as you thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to repel it in the firſt inſtance, I urge it again in the ſecond; it is a flaw in the indictment. There are three flaws, which I think ſufficient to quaſh the indictment entirely.</p>

            <sp>

               <p> No, my Lords, three are as good as three thouſand.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Solicitor General.</speaker>
               <p> My Lords, in anſwer to what has fallen from the Pannel, his objections are ſo extravagant as hardly to merit an anſwer. The only appearance of any thing like a legal objection is this: the gentleman ſays he is accuſed of Sedition, and calls upon us to point out where Sedition is made a crime, and by what Law, and what is the puniſhment affixed to it. My anſwer to that is, that Sedition was made a crime not by any ſtatute, but by the common Law of Scotland, and if the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man wiſhes for authority, I refer him to the book called Regiam Majeſtatem, where Sedition is expreſsly ſtated to be a crime, and I would tell him, that it is there declared to be puniſhable as treaſon. That is in the oldeſt book that we have upon the Law of Scotland. Since that, Sedition has not been puniſhed as trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but remained upon the footing of the common Law, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable by what is called an arbitrary puniſhment. As to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of Sedition, your Lordſhip knows there are many crimes of ſo complex and ſo vague a nature, that it is hardly poſſible to give a general definition to comprehend them all. If I am called upon to give a definition of high treaſon, I don't know any that I could give, except by enumerating all the different caſes of treaſon; or, ſuppoſe I was called upon to give a definition of falſehood or forgery, there are twenty different kinds of it; no definition can comprehend the whole. So alſo, I imagine it ſtands with regard to Sedition. At the ſame time, if a definition is wanted of the crime charged againſt that gentleman, I will read him Mr. Erſkine's definition of it in his firſt Inſtitute: He divides it into two parts, real Sedition and verbal Sedition: he
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:027594_0017_0FD54D40552D10F8"/>
ſays, real Sedition is generally committed by convocating toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a conſiderable number of people without lawful authority, under pretence of redreſſing grievances to the deſtroying of the public peace. Then he ſays, general Sedition is inferred from the convocation of a number of people without lawful authority, tending to diſturb the peace of the community. Is not this the very crime charged againſt this gentleman? if there was any lawful authority, the gentleman will tell us what it is. Can there be a doubt, that if the facts ſtated in this indictment be true, they not only tended to diſturb the peace of the country, but to ſubvert the Conſtitution of Great Britain. Therefore, taking the charge as it ſtands, there cannot be a doubt with any of your Lordſhips that it does amount to a charge of Sedition, and that Sedition is a crime puniſhable by the Law of this country? If there is any other country in the world, where Sedition is not made a crime by the common Law, I wiſh theſe gentlemen next time they hold Britiſh Conventions would meet in that country, for in Scotland, I will aſſure them, there is a Law to puniſh them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Margarot.</speaker>
               <p> My Lords, I hold in my hand a definition of Mr. Erſkine's, a little differing from what the gentleman has read; he ſays, <q>it conſiſts in raiſing commotions or diſturbances in the ſtate; it is either verbal or real. Verbal Sedition or Leaſing making, is inferred from the uttering of words, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to create diſcord between the king and his people,</q> and I think it is that gentleman who is guilty of Sedition, inaſmuch as he ſeeks to alienate the hearts of the ſubjects from their ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign. He ſays, <q>it was formerly puniſhed by death and the forfeiture of goods, but now either by impriſonent, fine, or baniſhment, at the diſcretion of the judge.</q> Now it ſeems to me, that that cannot be the Sedition which this gentleman means, for if I underſtand rightly, the Sedition I am charged with, is ſomething like that of Meſſrs. Muir, Palmer, and Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. Now if their Sedition had been the Sedition that is meant here, they would have been puniſhed by baniſhment and not by tranſportation; and therefore, there muſt have been ſome trif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling miſtake in that, my Lords. Now it ſays here, <q>for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting riots and tumults it is enacted, that if any perſons to the number of twelve ſhall aſſemble, and being required by a magiſtrate or conſtable to diſperſe, ſhall nevertheleſs continue together for an hour after ſuch command, the perſons diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhall ſuffer death.</q> Therefore, that cannot be the Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that I am charged with, for the indictment only pretends to know, what I am ſure the Almighty never commiſſioned the Lord Advocate to enquire into, namely, our ſecret intentions. I did not know before that there was an inquiſition in Scotland, and that he was Grand Inquiſitor; for certainly otherwiſe, the minds of the people are only to be gathered from their behaviour.</p>
               <p>My Lords, theſe meetings I will maintain were legal in the ſtricteſt ſenſe of the word; for the claim of rights entitles the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:027594_0018_0FD9B85F99AFF938"/>
people to petition Parliament; and it is impoſſible they could petition Parliament without meeting. The general will cannot be collected as you gather taxes from door to door. Good God! what has become of the Conſtitution that you trumpet up ſo much, if you give us the name and take away the eſſence? if the people are not to meet to examine their rights, and proceed upon their rights.</p>
               <p>My Lords, there is not one ſo barefaced as to pretend to deny our right to petition or addreſs the King. The Lord Advocate himſelf has acknowledged, that it is our right. He himſelf is a reformer, and has held ſeditious meetings as well as us; but then indeed he brings forward a curious reaſon: when the Lord Advocate is out of place, reform is proper; when in place, it is highly improper; and that is the doctrine of Mr. Pitt. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are poor, it is ſedition in us; but when your County Meetings are held, it is no longer ſedition; but it is a thing that is authorized. As long as they thought we were not ſufficiently formidable, and that there was no danger of opening the eyes of the people, ſo long did Juſtice nod; and ſhe only awoke when every man, hearing ſo much talk of the Conſtitution, began to examine what that Conſtitution was. And, to be ſure, it is a curious fiction in law (and you have a great many) by which our happy conſtitution has wiſely guarded the Proſecutor for the Crown; by which means the ſubject may at any time be oppreſſed and perſecuted by the officer of the Crown, and he can obtain no damages, no redreſs whatever. Happy if he gets off; happy if his ſentence does not come out of the pocket of a Miniſter of State. My Lords, our tranſactions have been legal. The illegal actions have been entirely on the part of our proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors. We have experienced the fate of general warrants: we have experienced the fate of a State Inquiſition. Good God! has not a man, living under the Britiſh Conſtitution, a right to examine that conſtitution, and to ſay, I am told, that it is the fineſt inſtitution in the world; and yet I feel my pocket emptied daily with taxes; I feel my liberties taken away one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and yet I muſt not meet with my neighbours to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of twelve, to diſcuſs thoſe injuries that I daily feel, and to enquire after the means of obtaining redreſs, but immediately comes a Crown Lawyer, claps the word Sedition upon it, and I am puniſhed. Then another man is charged with Sedition. My caſe is brought forward as a precedent, and therefore he muſt be puniſhed in the ſame way. I ſay, my Lord, if every ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle in this libel is proved, it redounds more to my honour than any thing elſe: it ſhews me the friend of my ſpecies; it ſhews me the friend of my country; it ſhews that I have done my duty as a good citizen; that I have endeavoured to procure that for every one of my fellow ſubjects that it is our right to enjoy; that I don't wiſh to enjoy a ſingle thing alone, neither place nor penſion; that I don't wiſh to enjoy any thing excluſively, but I
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:027594_0019_0FD9B86462F4CE88"/>
ſeek a reſtitution of our rights, a renovation of our Conſtitution, as it is ſaid here, by univerſal ſuffrage and annual parliaments.</p>
               <p>My Lords, perhaps your memories may fail you, for it is ſome time back when Mr. Pitt, at the Thatched Houſe Tavern, being a young man making his debut in Parliament, a young patriot making his entrée into the world, inſiſted upon a reform. It was then highly conſtitutional. My Lords, I have in my hand a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution entered into at the Thatched Houſe Tavern, on the 16th of May, 1782: <q>At a numerous and reſpectable meeting of Members of Parliament, friendly to a conſtitutional Reformation, and of members of ſeveral Committees of Counties and Cities.</q> Here, Gentlemen, you ſee Delegates, here you ſee a Convention; though a Convention is nothing new in Scotland; becauſe you have had the Borough Reform Convention, and the Lord Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate is himſelf upon that liſt. My Lords, at the Thatched Houſe Tavern were preſent the Duke of Richmond, Lord Surrey, Lord Mahon, the Lord Mayor. Here you ſee amongſt them the firſt municipal officer in England, the Lord Mayor, Sir Watkin Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, Mr. Duncomb, Sir Cecil Wray, Mr. Brand Hollis, Mr. Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the Hon. William Pitt, whom I mean to adduce as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culpatory evidence, if even the forms of juſtice are allowed me —the Reverend Mr. Wyvil, Major Cartwright, Mr. John Horne Tooke, Alderman Wilkes, Dr. Jebb, Mr. Churchill, Mr. Froſt, &amp;c. &amp;c. all men of learning, who well knew what the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this country is, and what it ought to be—men who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired not to be told what was ſedition and what was not—men who would not have riſked themſelves, if they had not known that they were upon conſtitutional ground, and they reſolve, <q>That the motion of the Hon. William Pitt, on the 7th inſtant, for the appointment of a Committee of the Houſe of Commons, to enquire into the ſtate of the repreſentation of the people of Great Britain, and to report the ſame to the Houſe; and alſo what ſteps it might be neceſſary to take having been defeated by a motion for the order of the day</q>—which is ſomething ſimilar to your repelling an objection of the Pannel, as ſoon as it is ſtated—<q>having been defeated by a motion for the order of the day, it is become indiſpenſably neceſſary that application ſhould be made to Parliament by petitions from the collective body of the people in their reſpective diſtricts.</q>—They were not to pour into the Houſe eight millions of petitions, but as many petitions from as many diſtricts as they could collect together, <q>requeſting a ſubſtantial reformation of the Commons Houſe of Parliament.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Reſolved unanimouſly, That this meeting, conſidering that a general application, by the collective body of the people, to the Houſe of Commons cannot be made before the cloſe of the preſent Seſſion, is of opinion that the ſenſe of the people ſhould be taken.</q> And how is the ſenſe of the people to be taken, I would aſk the learned gentlemen of the law, if they are
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:027594_0020_0FD54D453B90CB68"/>
not convened?—Who is to take the ſenſe of the people, if it is to be done by going round from man to man? and if twelve form a ſeditious meeting, it will come, by and by, perhaps to two or three, and it will be dangerous for one neighbour to ſpeak to another in the ſtreet, or any where elſe indeed; <q>that the ſenſe of the people ſhould be taken at ſuch times as may be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient during this ſummer, in order to lay their ſeveral peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before parliament, early in the next ſeſſion, with their propoſals for a Parliamentary Reformation,</q>—Obſerve this, men of Scotland!—Obſerve this, Britons! <q>without which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the liberty of the nation can be preſerved, nor the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manence of a wiſe and virtuous adminiſtration can be ſecure,</q> and I appeal to you all whether there is not truth and ſound doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine in it? <q>may receive that ample and mature diſcuſſion which ſo momentous a queſtion demands.</q>
               </p>
               <p>My Lords, it ſeems to have been in the year 1782 a very lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and a very conſtitutional thing to aſſemble, to meet to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of the grievances, and to plan a method by which they were to be redreſſed; in the year 1794, when the very man who planned, who firſt ſuggeſted this, who encouraged the people thereto, under his reign, I may call it, for he it the guide of the helm—the guide in the cabinet, while he is in abſolute power, that ſhall be conſidered as Sedition, which he himſelf firſt ſet on foot, in order to procure himſelf that birth; and, now he has got it, he has altered his ſentiments!—How ridiculous for a Crown Lawyer to attempt to impoſe upon a Court of Juſtice; or for any man to ſupport ſuch impoſition, that what was conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional in 1782 ſhould be criminal in 1794.—Fellow citizens, and I fear not to call you by that name—we are fellow citizens of one ſociety. By the word Citizen I mean a free man; a man enjoying all the rights and all the privileges, and paying his quota towards all the expence of Society. I ſay it is an inſolent attempt upon your underſtandings, to endeavour to perſuade you that that which was conſtitutional, that that which was right, that that which was juſtifiable in 1782 ſhould be criminal in 1794. It is true that an Engliſh jury has ſent to priſon a man for only reprinting thoſe Reſolutions. Holt, I think his name is, the printer of the Newark Journal, for reprinting in his paper, which pays a daily tax to government, that which the perſon to whom he pays the tax was the author of. Thus you ſee how Crown Lawyers pervert the conſtitution. With high-ſounding words they diſguiſe the moſt innocent facts; they ſport with the lives, and with that which ought to be infinitely more dear than their lives—with the liberties of his Majeſty's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Men who feel wrongs cannot feel them without ſome degree of acrimony, and when thoſe wrongs are repeated, this acrimony muſt increaſe; and theſe wrongs are done them in the King's name; but it is not the King, it is his ſervants who make uſe of his name; his ſeditious ſervants who ſeparate the King
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:027594_0021_0FD9B8298770C130"/>
from his people. My Lords, I know my doom. I am a willing and an already devoted victim. I have made objections, thoſe objections have been repelled. I ſhall inſiſt preſently on the calling over of my witneſſes. I ſhall then demand a caption againſt ſuch as do not appear. If my juſt, my legal, my conſtitutional de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are repelled, I will ſit down; I will beg the Gentlemen of the Jury not to give themſelves any further trouble; I will proteſt againſt the proceedings of the Court, and beg of them to paſs to ſentence; which I know it will be no difficult matter for them to do.</p>

               <p> My Lords, we are called upon to decide upon the relevancy of this indictment, which charges in the major propoſition, that the crime of ſedition, in this and every other well governed realm, is a crime of a heinous nature, and ſeverely puniſhable. And, my Lord, the firſt part of it (to which it might be ſufficient to confine myſelf at preſent) charges that this Society, calling themſelves the Britiſh Convention of Delegates of the People, met under the pretence of Reform; that it was of a dangerous and deſtructive tendency, and was with the deliberate and determined intention to diſturb the peace of the community, and to ſubvert the preſent conſtitution of the country; and that this gentleman, Maurice Margarot, did take an active and diſtinguiſhing part in their deliberations; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, that he took an active and diſtinguiſhing part in the deliberations of a Society, met with a determined purpoſe to overturn the Conſtitution; that is the charge, true or falſe it is not our province at preſent to enquire; that muſt be left to the Jury. The criminality does, to be ſure, conſiſt in, that they met with a determined purpoſe to overturn the Conſtitution: and the Jury, when they come to decide upon it, muſt take into their view the ſeveral things charged in this indictment, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to this meeting. As to the form that they aſſumed, how far that was neceſſary to obtain a reform in Parliament, it is the province of the Jury to enquire; and under all the circumſtances of the caſe, to lay their hands upon their heart, and upon their great oaths to ſay what was the purpoſe of that meeting, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the facts before them. My Lord, if that is made out-which is the charge, and in conſidering the relevancy, I am, bound to hold the charge as proved, there cannot be a doubt that it amounts to ſedition. I ſay it approaches to high treaſon: and I find in the caſes tried in England, in 1745, it appears from Judge Foſter's Report, the charges laid againſt the priſoners were very little different from thoſe contained in the preſent indictment. It ran in theſe terms: <q>Alſo deviſing and as much as in them lay moſt wickedly and traiterouſly intending to change and ſubvert the rule of government of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, duly and happily eſtabliſhed under our preſent Sovereign Lord the King, and alſo to depoſe and deprive our ſaid pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:027594_0022_0FD54D47F5CA0118"/>
Sovereign Lord the King of his title,</q> and ſo on. Now, my Lord, the charge is, that the purpoſe of this meeting was to ſubvert the Conſtitution; and if it was, where can the doubt be, that it does amount to Sedition. My Lord, I leave it to the ſenſe of every man who hears me, if an intention to ſubvert the Conſtitution of a country is not Sedition. In matters of criminal law you muſt go by the underſtanding and the ſenſe of mankind, and in this inſtance particularly the Jury are to determine upon the law as well as the fact.</p>
               <p>My Lord, with reſpect to Sedition it is of various kinds; no doubt its general tendency is to reſiſt and undermine, or attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reſiſt and undermine the Conſtitution of the country, and ſubvert the ſupreme power of the ſtate. It may either be of a public or a private nature. When of a private nature, it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected againſt matters of a private life, it may be in direct op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to acts of parliament, with reſpect to incloſures, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of commonalties, turn pikes, and ſo on. But of a public nature is the crime which is charged againſt this Gentleman: an intention to ſubvert the Conſtitution. My Lord, ſedition may be attended with tumult or without: with riſing in arms, or without riſing in arms. My Lord, ſedition of a public kind, is as various as the ingenuity of wickedneſs can ſuggeſt. It may be committed by words, by writing, by painting, by medals, by allegories, by actions, by falſe inſinuation, by falſe argument, by tumult and inſurrection, by mobs, by cabals, by open and ſecret meetings; by conſpiracies and by conventions. If the Jury are ſatisfied in their minds that the intention of this is to overturn the Conſtitution; it is Sedition. My Lord, it was ſaid that there was no law againſt this. As to that, my Lord, every well regulated government muſt make it Sedition; becauſe otherwiſe ſociety could not exiſt. It always has been, and muſt remain a common law crime, and muſt be puniſhable by common law.</p>
               <p>My Lord, having ſaid ſo much, I think there can be no doubt that the Libel is relevant. The Pannel is at liberty to ſtate what he pleaſes in his defence. To inſiſt it was for a partial reform by legal means, and that nothing elſe was meant by this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary guiſe that this convention took upon themſelves to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume; the Jury will, upon the whole, judge whether this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence or whether the charge is relevant. In the mean time it is my humble opinion that it is relevant.</p>

               <p> My Lord, as to the crime of Sedition, I cannot read the Indictment, nor I think any body elſe, and ſay that if this man was concerned in holding theſe meetings, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of diſturbing the peace of the community, and ſubverting the conſtitution of the country, that that is not the crime of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. My Lord, it is not the province of ſuch men as theſe to take upon themſelves the amendment of the Government. The intention of their meeting, they ſay, was to obtain univerſal
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:027594_0023_0FD9B867EBFF2F00"/>
ſuffrage; or, in other words, to eſtabliſh that every man living in this country is to have a vote to chooſe a Repreſentative in Parliament; a thing that never did obtain, and that does not now obtain, and never can obtain in this country. But, my Lord, it ſeems that if an act ſhould take place for the purpoſe of ſuppreſſing ſuch illegal meetings, that this is to be their tocſin, and their alarm bell for the purpoſe of meeting, when, where, or how, is to be kept a deep ſecret—it is not to be divulged even among themſelves; but it was to be conſined to this gentleman, and two or three more, who were to call a Convention of Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, and they were to continue to aſſemble, and not to obey ſuch act if it ſhould paſs. My Lord, if the charges in this Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are proved, it is impoſſible to deny my aſſent, that they do infer the crime of Sedition. I am of opinion that this libel is revelantly laid. I ſhall be exceedingly happy, if this gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is found innocent; but that lies with the Jury, and not with us.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Swinton.</speaker>
               <p> My Lord, the queſtion that is now under our conſideration is, whether this libel is relevant to infer the pains of law. And, my Lord, it has been ſo fully diſcuſſed, not only at this time, but upon the occaſion of a very late trial, that it is perfectly unneceſſary to go over the ground again that has been already gone over. But, my Lord, in this eaſe the indictment, ſtates, that a motion was made, upon which the Pannel ſays, <q>This is an excellent motion. The event which it alludes to, ought to be the tocſin for the friends of liberty to aſſemble.</q> My Lord, this is a very ill choſen word. What is this tocſin? It is an inſtrument made uſe by the people in France to aſſemble. It is borrowed from a place from which I would wiſh to borrow very little. For what purpoſe are they to aſſemble? They ſay to aſſert their rights. By what means? can any man be at a loſs to make the anſwer? By violence and outrage, and no other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation can be given to it. My Lord, afterwards a propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal is made for a ſealed letter to be given to the Delegates, which was not to be opened till a certain period: like an order that is ſometimes given to ſhips when they ſail, that they are not to open their inſtructions till they come to a certain latitude; and the meaning is, that thoſe inſtructions ſhall not be known, for fear they ſhould be prevented. There can be no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and yet they afterwards ſay, we make no ſecrets of any thing. Then there is a reſolution, that this Convention, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the calamitous conſequence of any act of the Legiſlature, which may tend to deprive the people of their undoubted right to meet, declare before God and the world, that we ſhall follow the wholeſome example of former times, by paying no regard to any act which ſhall militate againſt the Conſtitution of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Is not this declaring that they will oppoſe the Legiſlature itſelf? My Lord, it does not require any proof of its being Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Then, my Lord, among other caſes of emergency, on
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:027594_0024_0FD9B87CE22760B0"/>
which they were to meet, it is mentioned, <q>or in caſe of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion.</q> My Lord, for what purpoſe were they to meet pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, in caſe of invaſion? The Legiſlature, the executive part of government is to look after that. Every man muſt feel what they meant: that they ſhould aſſemble the Delegates altogether at a particular time, and all at one time they ſhould meet, in caſe of an invaſion. My Lord, I gave my ſentiments very fully this day ſe'n night upon the ſame queſtion, and I have not altered them, but feel them ſtronger and ſtronger. I am ſorry to ſee ſo many examples brought before us, and I hope there will be but few more; I am of opinion that the libel is relevant.</p>

               <p> My Lord, the only queſtion at preſent for our conſideration is, whether the libel is relevant and is laid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly. My Lord, the major propoſition ſtates the crime of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: the minor propoſition ſpecifies a variety of circumſtances, which, if they come up to the crime of Sedition, the libel is re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>levant; and, my Lord, I have but one doubt upon this ſubject; and that is, whether in ſome of theſe particulars it is any thing ſhort of the crime of high treaſon; but I think that it amounts to Sedition, there can be no doubt; and I think that the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary interlocutory ought to be pronounced.</p>

               <p> Your Lordſhip's objection is not valid, as will appear to yourſelf upon reflection, inaſmuch as if you are not competent to give a ſecond citation, you was not competent to the firſt. On the contrary, it appears that the letters of excul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation found no difficulty in being backed by a Judge in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and the ſubpoena was ſerved upon them according to the laws of England; and therefore, by a ſecond diligence, they will be purſued in the ſame manner; and that will be backed by a Judge, and the ſame compulſion will be excerciſed upon them in England as would be in Scotland, if they reſided here.—And, my Lord, I will not permit this to be paſſed over eaſily, they are very material evidences—they are men of high ſtation in the ſtate—they are men of great reſponſibility—they are men whoſe actions are public, and the queſtions that <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

are of a very important nature.—There is again another thing —it ſeems you overlook ſomethings and pry very cloſely into others—it ſeems you are not competent to enforce the attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a witneſs from England, but it appears, by the libel, that you are competent to try offences committed in England. My Lord, mete with an equal meaſure—let my objection be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to in a proper manner.

My Lords, I underſtand in England it is not an eaſy matter to obtain wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, before their own courts; but of that I profeſs myſelf ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant: but I know of no inſtance in which this court have taken cognizance of the non-attendance of witneſſes, reſident in a foreign country; for England, with reſpect to the law, is as much a foreign country, as Germany, Italy, or any other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.—</p>

But, my Lords, let juſtice take place;—remember you have, in the courſe of this trial, to praiſe the Conſtitution, it will be told the people how happily they live under it—how free and happy every man is living under his own vine and his own fig-tree. Let it be proved; let it be proved that a Court of Juſtice does every thing in favour of the Pannel, as much as in favour of the Proſecutor. The objections
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:027594_0028_0FD54D50F43839A0"/>
that I made have been repelled; but they will be noticed in a ſuperior Court.—There is a Court ſuperior to your's, and there muſt be, in every well regulated government, an appeal to a ſuperior Court, from whence the abuſes of the ſervants of the Crown may be rectified.</p>

               <p> I think you ſeem to be unacquainted with the laws of any well governed ſtate, and if you were not a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner and a ſtranger, we would not have ſuffered you to have ſaid one half of what you have ſaid.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Margarot.</speaker>
               <p> Oh! very well, my Lords.—however permit me one queſtion, and I will put it to the generoſity of the public proſecutor to anſwer it. My Lord Advocate, is it in your power or not to bring a witneſs on the part of the proſecution from Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, upon your honour anſwer me?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Advocate.</speaker>
               <p> No more than you can.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Margarot.</speaker>
               <p> Does not an outlawry extend to England?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Solicitor General.</speaker>
               <p> For a crime it certainly does, but not as to a witneſs.—Suppoſing a Scotchman to be tried before a Court in England, and in place of ſeeking the aſſiſtance of ſome Engliſh Counſel, as he ought to do, he were to utter things of the ſame kind that this Pannel has done, I doubt whether he would be heard with the ſame patience with which your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip has heard him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Juſtice Clerk.</speaker>
               <p> Do you wiſh a caption againſt thoſe two witneſſes who reſide in Scotland?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Margarot.</speaker>
               <p> No, my Lords,—I don't wiſh to puniſh two poor men, and let three rich men go unpuniſhed.—There is another thing which I believe takes place before the impannel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Jury, which reſpects the opening of the doors of this place. In looking over the claim of rights, in the 27th chapter, I find it is ſaid, that in criminal trials, which are of ſo great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, the doors of the Court ſhall be thrown open.—I demand therefore that the doors of this place may be opened, in order that the people may partake of what paſſes.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Juſtice Clerk.</speaker>

that he had taken into his poſſeſſion ſeveral papers, part of them he deſcribed to be Mr. Gerald's, part of them to be Mr. Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rot's; they were put into a trunk together, this trunk was brought to the office, and after he was examined, he was deſired to give the key, that it might be opened; he declined to do ſo, upon which we applied for a warrant to have the trunk opened, which was carried into execution; it was inſpected in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Mr. Margarot and Mr. Gerald. He was brought to the office upon a ſecond warrant, and Mr. Gerald alſo attended, he refuſed then to give it up without force, and he held it in his hand and ſaid, I will not give it up, but you may take it; he ſaid, he would not witneſs the trunk being opened, and turned round and looked out of the window. Upon the trunk being opened, there were ſome articles that did not relate to the buſineſs in hand, particularly a pocket-book of Mr. Margarot's, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Mr. Gerald's, which were reſtored; and thoſe that were conſidered relative to the buſineſs were entered into an inventory.</p>

called upon to take the chair, which he accordingly did. Mr. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidſon aſked, if it was the Britiſh Convention? upon being told it was, he told them that they came for the purpoſe of diſmiſſing them, and that they ſhould not proceed to any buſineſs; the anſwer was, that they would not till force was uſed, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the Pannel ſaid, that he would not leave the chair, as he was then diſcharging his duty, till force was uſed; to that Mr. Davidſon ſaid, he ſuppoſed any thing that had that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance would be ſatisfactory, and took Mr. Margarot by the hand, upon which he left the chair: upon his leaving the chair, there was a call for Mr. Gerald to take the chair, which he according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did, and the ſame form was uſed with regard to him: Mr. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidſon took him by the hand, and it was then called out that they never diſmiſſed without prayer, and Mr. Gerald prayed and then came out of the chair; it was then ſaid by ſomebody, that though they were now diſmiſſed, they would remember that they were permanent, that they had voted themſelves per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent the night before.</p>

               <p> Did this happen the day after the Pannel had been exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined before the Sheriff, and liberated upon his finding bail?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p> Was it on account of a charge of ſeditious practices of the ſame nature that he was brought before the Sheriff?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p> It was for being a member of that Convention.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p> By virtue of a warrant which I had obtained from the Sheriff of Edinburgh, as Procurator-Fiſcal.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p> Was that warrant granted at your requiſition?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p> That certainly has not any connection with the preſent buſineſs; and I think I am not bound to anſwer that queſtion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p> It has, Sir! and you muſt anſwer it, as you appear before God at the great day. <hi>(The witneſs heſitated).</hi>

               <speaker>Mr. Margarot.</speaker>
               <p> My Lord, I muſt have the protection of the Court.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Juſtice Clerk.</speaker>
               <p> I don't think it proper he ſhould tell who gave the information.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Abercrombie.</speaker>
               <p> I am of the ſame opinion.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Eſkgrove.</speaker>
               <p> He acted as Procurator-Fiſcal of Edinburgh, and therefore he is no more liable, or bound to ſay, who was his private informer, than my Lord Advocate is.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Dunſinnan.</speaker>
               <p> It is entering into an inveſtigation which the Pannel has no right to make.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Margarot.</speaker>
               <p> My Lords, I hope I have not put an improper
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:027594_0033_0FD7BFAEC2B47970"/>
queſtion: I know it is cuſtomary at Venice; they have a lion's mouth to receive all private ſecret information, but I did not know that it was ſo here; I thought that juſtice was open.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Abercrombie.</speaker>
               <p> I am ſorry to obſerve, that from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this trial, the Pannel has betrayed the groſſeſt ignorance of the laws of this country; and I muſt regret that he has not had the advice of thoſe who know better; but if he is to object to things in this way, I truſt he will do it, for his own ſake, in a decent manner.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Margarot.</speaker>
               <p> Then I am to underſtand that the reception of ſecret information, is a part of the laws of the country. The officer found Mr. Gerald and me in the ſame room?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I was told ſo; but that is only from report.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>Where was that room; at the Black Bull?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; I was told ſo.</p>

               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>At a public inn?—</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yes.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>Was the door locked?—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot ſay.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>How do you aſcertain that thoſe papers were mine which you have juſt now produced?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I have told all that I can; it was from Mr. Gerald's and your own pointing them out.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>I underſtand you have ſaid that I emitted a declaration: a declaration, if I underſtand it rightly, is a certain verbal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>A declaration may be negative, and it is ſtill a declaration.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Juſtice Clerk.</speaker>
               <p> You may make a declaration that you are innocent as well as that you are guilty.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Margarot.</speaker>
               <p> It would have much the ſame effect. What reaſon did I allege for refuſing to emit a declaration?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I don't recollect.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>In the courſe of your practice do you know any law which enforces a private interrogatory?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Solicitor General.</speaker>
               <p> If the gentleman is an attorney, as I am told, I ſhould like to know whether he would be ſuffered to go on in this way in the courts of Weſtminſter-Hall?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Juſtice Clerk.</speaker>
               <p> It is certainly not a queſtion ſit for the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to anſwer.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Margarot.</speaker>
               <p> Have you any mode of diſtinguiſhing thoſe papers found in my trunk from thoſe that belonged to Mr. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald in the ſame trunk?—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot ſay.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>Then it may happen that you may have intermixed a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Mr. Gerald's and a paper of mine?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>No; they were taken down diſtinctly, and marked with your own initials in your own preſence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>Who arranged the papers?</p>

            <sp>

               <speaker>Lord Juſtice Clerk.</speaker>
               <p> Did you not ſay, the Pannel picked out his papers and Mr. Gerald his?</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>Did I not obſerve to you at the time, that being in an inn, we could not be anſwerable for what papers were found in our room?—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>Did I not ſay, that even the meſſenger might bring that paper, if he thought proper, and huſtle them into the trunk at once?—</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>So you did.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>By what means are you certain, that the papers which you found in Mr. Skirving's poſſeſſion were minutes of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>From various circumſtances; but I ſubmit again to the court, whether it is proper to anſwer that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Juſtice Clerk.</speaker>
               <p> Yes; you muſt give anſwers to legal queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The minutes were eſtabliſhed to be minutes of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, by ſome of the members.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>You accompanied the Sheriff to Mr. Laing's room.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; you was the firſt perſon that called to me, handed me a motion, and deſired I would read it; I told him I had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with it: it was a motion to petition the King, or ſomething of that kind.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>Do you recollect the Sheriff Subſtitute ſaying, that he acted by orders?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot ſay; but he certainly told you, he came for the expreſs purpoſe of diſmiſſing that meeting, and that you muſt do no buſineſs as a Britiſh Convention.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>Did I not ſpeak to you; and you afterwards anſwered me, that you was doing your duty?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; by attending the Sheriffs.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>You ſay that the meeting ended with prayer; can you recollect that prayer?—</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>Did the petition for the warrant ſtate, that I had met with others in Laing's workſhop, that I had been forced from the chair, that we had ſaid that we were aſſembled for petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a reform of parliament, and cloſed with prayer?

               <p>It was on Friday evening, the 6th of December, I went and attended the Lord Provoſt, with the magiſtrates of the city; a great number of people were aſſembled in a wright's ſhop, and I went immediately up to the table, where I ſaw ſome people whoſe faces I recognized; Mr. Skirving, Mr. Brown, Mr. Margarot, and ſeveral others; I aſked what the meeting was? I did not get a direct anſwer; I aſked if it was the Britiſh Convention? One of the members, and I think it was Mr. Margarot, ſaid that it was; I told him that I was Sheriff Subſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute for the county, and that I came there to diſperſe that meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which was an illegal one, upon this ſome converſation took place; and I think Mr. Margarot was the man who ſpoke moſt on account of the Convention; he ſaid, they were met peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, that it was a legal Conſtitutional Meeting, and that they were then met for a petition to Parliament. I told him, that my reſolution had been taken before I came there; that I came with a determination to diſperſe that meeting; that no words were neceſſary, no argument that they could uſe could alter my determination: ſome more converſation took place. Mr. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garot, finding I was determined upon it, ſaid that he would take the chair, with the approbation of the meeting, which was then empty; accordingly upon this, he was unanimouſly called to the chair: I think before he took the chair, he ſaid, the meeting would not diſperſe without force was uſed; I told him, I hoped it would be unneceſſary to uſe force, but if it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, I ſhould certainly make uſe of it. He took the chair, and finding they would not diſperſe without ſome force, I took him by the arm, which he conſidered as force, and he came out of the chair; immediately upon his doing ſo, Mr. Gerald, another of the gentlemen preſent, took the chair; I told him I really thought that it was improper that another perſon ſhould do the ſame thing, if they were all to take the chair one after another; I hoped they would not think that neceſſary; however I took the ſame method of forcing Mr. Gerald from the chair that I did Mr. Margarot: Mr. Gerald then made an extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore prayer, and left the chair. Mr. Margarot, amongſt other things that he mentioned, ſaid, the meeting of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention had declared themſelves permament. I told him it might be ſo, but I was determined they ſhould not meet within the county where I had a juriſdiction. I think they called out for the gentlemen to diſperſe, and by degrees they diſperſed; and I ſaw the laſt perſon out, and ſaw the door locked, and took the key.</p>

               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>Did I not give one uniform reaſon for declining to emit a declaration, for refuſing to give up the key of my trunk, and for aſſerting the right of the Convention to meet; did I not ſay, that the proceedings againſt them were illegal?—</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Margarot.</speaker>
               <p> It only hinges upon another. Did you ſee at the time of your entrance there, any confuſion, riot, or diſorder?</p>

               <p>I can only ſay, that theſe are papers which were found in Mr. Skirving's poſſeſſion, and they were acknowledged to be ſo by various people, who were examined before me; that is the only reaſon I have: I did not ſee them in the Convention.</p>

               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>There is another queſtion which I hope your Lordſhips will not think improper. In your office as Sheriff, have you to the beſt of your judgment acted according to the laws of your country, or have you acted by ſuperior orders?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Do you recollect at any time, any motion or propoſal for a Committee of Union?</p>
            </sp>

               <p>No; I was not preſent then.</p>

               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>With any reference to ſuch a bill as had paſſed in Ireland?</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>Mr. Solicitor General.</speaker>
               <p> Do you remember a motion being made by Mr. Calendar?—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>Do you remember any thing what it was about?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I remember one of the motions, about the people meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in defence of their liberties, in caſe of any bill being brought into Parliament, ſimilar to a Convention Bill in Ireland againſt the Conſtitution of the country.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>What did Mr. Calendar propoſe that your Convention ſhould do in that caſe?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I recollect a motion of that import being introduced, and that Mr. Calendar acknowledged the motion as his; but as to any thing relative to that motion, I do not know.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>Was you preſent when the motion was made?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>There was a rule in the Convention, that no motion ſhould be diſcuſſed the ſame night on which it was made; I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent when it was brought in by Mr. Calendar.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>What was it that Mr. Calendar propoſed ſhould be done in caſe ſuch a bill ſhould be brought into the Britiſh Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Margarot.</speaker>
               <p> I object to that queſtion, as it reſpects Mr. Calendar, and not me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Solicitor General.</speaker>
               <p> It is charged in the indictment againſt this very pannel; and, therefore, I will repeat the queſtion. What was it that Mr. Calendar propoſed ſhould be done, in caſe it ſhould be brought into the Britiſh Parliament?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>That the people ſhould meet to aſſert their right, ſo far as I recollect.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>Was there any debate upon it that night?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>It is a rule that there ſhall be no debate when a queſtion is propoſed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>Was you preſent when it was diſcuſſed?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Not when it was diſcuſſed in that ſhape in which Mr. Callendar introduced it; but I was when it was amended: ſo far as I recollect, the ſpirit of Mr. Calendar's motion was retained; but it was very much extended: there was a propoſal of what, in certain events, ſhould take place. I don't clearly remember the circumſtances about it; but it was a motion for a Secret Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, in caſe thoſe events ſhould take place.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, it was, that they ſhould meet in a certain place, in certain events.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>Now, be ſo good as tell us what thoſe events were, as far as you remember them?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The one already named, was that of a bill being brought into Parliament ſimilar to the Convention Bill in Ireland; as to the other, I cannot remember.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>There was a motion that a place ſhould be fixed upon by a Secret Committee; they were to find out a way of letting the Delegates know of it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The reaſon was, a thorough conviction of the neceſſity of a Reform in the Britiſh Houſe of Commons.</p>

               <p>It was to help forward that great and grand object that ſo forcibly ſtruck my mind.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Force of arms was never mentioned in the Convention, and it is the laſt thing that I ſhould wiſh, to ſee a drop of blood ſpilt in the cauſe.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>It was diametrically oppoſite to my views to have the leaſt recourſe to open force, nor was it the ſubject of diſcuſſion in the Convention.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>So far as I recollect, the deſign of that Committee was to draw up regulations, by which the people of England and Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,

               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p> Have you ever ſeen it cuſtomary in any Clubs, if you ever belonged to any, that there ſhould be a certain degree of truſt repoſed in a ſmall number of confidential men, who ſhould form a Committee and retain ſome ſecrets to themſelves, not to be divulged to the world?

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>So far from ſtriking me as an unprecedented thing, that it ſtrikes me upon many occaſions as a neceſſary thing, pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially to keep ſecrets of every ſociety when it is neceſſary for their intereſt.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, I think I have.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>What I conceive to be the direct deſign of the Committee was to form rules, by which the Convention might regulate themſelves in their preſent and in their ſubſequent meetings, if they ſhould ſee occaſion for any.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p> Do you think that the Committee of Organization did not likewiſe refer to the internal regulation of the Convention?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>As I meant to expreſs in my laſt anſwer, I conſidered the committee of Organization to refer chiefly to the internal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Convention, and with reſpect to future Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if there ſhould be ſuch.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p> It ſeems that you have heard that meetings of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention were at times called ſittings; do you imagine that that expreſſion was adopted as borrowed from a neighbouring country, or that is was an expreſſion which followed of courſe, and to which we are thoroughly accuſtomed in the Engliſh lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>However the reading of newſpapers might lead us to make uſe of terms, I cannot ſay; but it was certainly a word that it was very natural to make uſe of.</p>

               <p>Theſe things appeared to me to be ſo trifling, that I did not think it worth my while to make any objection to them: ſome were of French origin, and ſome of Britiſh, and ſome of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin; but I did not think it worth while to make any objection to it.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>What I underſtand by Convention was, that they met with a ſincere and hearty deſign to promote the good of the country, by a thorough reform in the Britiſh Houſe of Commons, and that they meant to do this by peaceable means.</p>

               <p>Do you imagine that if a Convention Bill was to be paſſed, or was even to be brought into the Houſe of Commons, that it would not ſhew a diſpoſition in the Houſe of Commons to extend their privileges, and to encroach upon our rights?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Such a Bill has always ſtruck me as ſapping the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Civil Liberty; and, indeed going beyond the power of the legiſlators themſelves, to deprive the people of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural rights.</p>

               <p>In what light did you look upon the members of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Convention?

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Their deſign, I have to reaſon no call in queſtion, was the good of their country: as to characters, there is always a mixture in all aſſemblies; but I believe, taking the whole toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there was a great degree of reſpectability with reſpect to characters.</p>

               <p>We had originally Parliaments, or ſome time back, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments of three years; now by an Act of Parliament they are lengthened to ſeven years; ſuppoſe another Act ſhould make them during life, and a third Act ſhould make them hereditary, do you imagine that would be an unconſtitutional act?</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>It has always ſtruck me as a thing beyond their power to alter or deſtroy the fundamental rights of the people, or any thing that would extend their own power.</p>

               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>Do you imagine it to be either in the Bill of Rights, or the claim of rights, expreſſed, that the people ſhould be at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to meet to communicate to each other their grievances, and plan methods for obtaining redreſs?</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Conſidering their numbers, they were free of that beyond many meetings that I have ſeen of the ſame number: I ſaw no riotous meetings: there were ſometimes diſputes, but no riots.</p>

               <speaker>Q.</speaker>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I always conſidered, that in the Convention the Members that had occaſion to ſpeak, always ſpoke freely, believing that they had nothing eſſentially ſecret to keep to themſelves, but that their great object was the good of their country.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>That reminds me of a miſtake I made before; for I find that I have recorded that very motion which Mr. Sinclair moved to be burnt, and which was afterwards agreed not to be burnt; and I heard further of the buſineſs next day.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>There was a motion made for a Convention of Emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; did the Convention ever fix upon or delineate the plan by which they were to act, or did that Convention ever take place?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Not that I know of.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>In joining the Friends of the People, and in joining the Britiſh Convention, for the purpoſe of obtaining a reform, did you think yourſelves warranted by the Conſtitution to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to obtain a redreſs of grievances?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Perfectly; and I would think ſo ſtill, if I were to be ſent to Botany Bay for it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>Are thoſe grievances done away?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>By no means; and I am ſorry for it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>Are you of opinion, that if a Convention Bill was paſſed in the Britiſh Parliament, it would tend to leſſen thoſe grievances.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>It would extend them tenfold.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>What would be the conſequence of the ſuſpenſion of the Habeas Corpus act, and of the Act for preventing wrongous impriſonment?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>It would be certainly a great encroachment upon the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of Britons.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>Might not every peaceable inhabitant of theſe realms run great danger, in caſe of a foreign invaſion, of loſing his property, by the enemies plundering him of it, if they were ſucceſsful?—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I have no doubt of that.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>Do you think it would be more conſtitutional in Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, more conſtitutional in Scotchmen, more conſtitutional in Britons, to ſit idle and look at a foreign invaſion, or attend a Convention of Emergency.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I dare ſay the whole Court, and all the audience will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that to meet upon ſuch an occaſion, would be a work of neceſſity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>Was foreign invaſion the expreſſion that was made uſe of, or was a French invaſion ever mentioned?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>As far as I recollect, French invaſion was mentioned in ſome perſon's motion; but I cannot ſay in whoſe motion, or whether it was in doors, or out of doors; or in the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or out of the Convention, I cannot ſay.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Q.</speaker>
               <p>Then you mean to ſay, that an Invaſion from France was uppermoſt in the minds of the Convention?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot ſay what was uppermoſt; but I know I have heard that expreſſion, but I believe it was out of the Convention.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Margarot.</speaker>
               <p>What is your opinion of magiſtrates? are they to act according to law, or do you apprehend there is a code of laws in this country which is to be the rule of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct?</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, pray attend to this: By what authority did the claſſes or the ſections, or whatever they may be thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be called; by what authority did they draw up any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or paper? Was it by any expreſs command of the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or was it an authority they aſſumed of themſelves, as mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſend their intentions, their opinions, to the Convention, there to be diſcuſſed?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>It was generally by the authority of the minutes from the Convention the preceding night; but that paper was, as far as I recollect, drawn up without any minutes having been ſent by the Convention.</p>
            </sp>

               <p>You ſay this was drawn up by the claſs without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the Convention?</p>

               <p> No, my Lord, they do not relate to this tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al: queſtions as to facts, which are at all material to the charges contained in this indictment, my Lord Juſtice Clerk is obliged to anſwer, but not otherwiſe.</p>

               <p> What may have been ſaid in a private com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany cannot in any way affect this caſe as to the Pannel at the bar: it certainly cannot throw any light upon the ſubject: my Lord, I have concurred in allowing this gentleman, who is a ſtranger from London, to put ſuch queſtions as I never before heard of in a Court of Juſtice, where, my Lord, every ſubject of this country, the meaneſt and the pooreſt that ſtands at that bar, may have the aſſiſtance of counſel learned in the law. If his ſituation was ſuch that he could not afford it, he might have got it by the authority of this Court, which would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented many things that were ſtated upon the relevancy. My Lord, there has not been a queſtion put to your Lordſhip that could at all avail Mr. Margarot as to his innocency in this trial,
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:027594_0075_0FD7C0542CEB9E58"/>
and your Lordſhip very properly waved anſwering them. I am of opinion that you ought not to anſwer queſtions of that ſort, which cannot involve the fate of the trial; I therefore think that it is not conſiſtent with the dignity of this Court, and cannot be beneficial to the Pannel.</p>

               <speaker>Lord Swinton.</speaker>
               <p> Any thing that may tend to exculpate him, or alleviate the crime charged againſt him, had he propoſed queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that ſort, not only my Lord Juſtice Clerk, but every one of us muſt have anſwered them by the laws of the country; but the anſwer to none of theſe queſtions can either tend to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culpate him or alleviate the offence of which he is accuſed. My Lord, not one of them are proper, not one of them are compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and ought not to be allowed to be put; and were he not a ſtranger to this country, I ſhould look upon it as an inſult offered to this Court.</p>

               <p> The Pannel is allowed to adduce what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culpatory witneſſes he thinks proper; your Lordſhip well knows that by the conſtant rule of this Court, before the Pannel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds with his exculpatory proof, he is called upon to ſtate the nature of that proof: he has put queſtions to your Lordſhip, and it appears to me that no anſwer to thoſe queſtions could in any degree tend to exculpate or alleviate the charges againſt him.</p>

               <p>It is needleſs, my Lord, when I am told that the anſwers to ſuch queſtions would neither exculpate me nor alleviate the charges againſt me, but it would have gone to ſhew the Jury that I was pre-judged before my trial came on; and I did mean indeed to have followed it up by another queſtion, had you been on your oath; but as you are not, I will not put it.</p>

               <p> No, but it libels me and the friends of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form in Parliament; it is a compariſon between the Friends of a Reform in this country, and the Anarchiſts in France, and I want, but I don't ſee why I need tell my wants, unleſs he is to be called; I want to know from whom it was that he received the original of this letter; that is a fair queſtion that I have a right to aſk in any court of Juſtice, and it is a queſtion that ought to be anſwered: 'tis a paper that has thrown an odium upon the Friends of Reform.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Dunſinnan.</speaker>
               <p> This would lead into a very extenſive field, if the Pannel be allowed to go into an inveſtigation of all the

writings that have been publiſhed, that have thrown, as he ſays, an odium upon the Friends of Reform, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing founded upon it againſt the Pannel.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Henderland.</speaker>
               <p> This paper is no part of the evidence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced againſt Mr. Margarot, otherwiſe he might be entitled to enquire by whom it was put in; but to go into a queſtion of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that has been ſaid for and againſt the Friends of the People in the newſpapers, is totally irrelevant to this trial; for if Mr. Margarot has been injured in that reſpect, the law is open to him, not on this trial, but on another occaſion, and it can have nothing to do with this trial.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Swinton.</speaker>
               <p> By an act of 1748, it is the priſoner's duty by that Act of Parliament, to give in, the night before the trial, or ſometime before the trial, the facts upon which he is to found his defence, and he ſhall be allowed to prove nothing in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, but what is contained in that liſt of facts; but if what he has now ſtated would be material to his defence, I am ſure the Lord Advocate would allow him to prove it; but there is nothing here that could tend either to exculpate or alleviate; it would lead us into every thing that has been wrote, pro and con. upon the ſubject, and who it was that gave the foundation for it, and therefore I conceive it not regular.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Eſkgrove.</speaker>
               <p> I am of the ſame opinion; I think it can be of no avail to him upon the face of the earth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Juſtice Clerk.</speaker>
               <p> It is very true, my Lord, that there is a ſtatute of the late King, and I think it was a very proper rule that was adopted by that ſtatute, and I am ſorry that it is no more attended to than it is, and I ſhould be ſorry to deny this Pannel any thing that could avail him in his defence, and he might have had the advice of Scots lawyers or agents, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am of opinion, that it would not tend to criminate other people who are not here, or are not put upon their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>

               <p> Gentlemen of the Jury, you are called upon in the common and uſual routine of your duty to decide upon the truth of the indictment, which I have felt it my duty to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer againſt the Pannel at the bar, who is ſtiled, and calls himſelf in the paper which is termed a Declaration, emitted by himſelf, before a proper officer, to be a merchant, reſiding in Marybon in London; you are therefore his equals, and his proper and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Jury to decide upon his guilt.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I muſt ſay, and again repeat, that you ſit this night in the common courſe and routine of your duty, although, if I charge my memory right, or I can truſt to the Note which I took at the time the Pannel in that ſpeech, or rather ſucceſſion of ſpeeches which came from him, not in my opinion with much judgment, not in my apprehenſion with much prudence; ſaid ſomething of Packed Juries, and (which he has a right to ſay) of my endeavouring to impoſe upon your underſtandings: I truſt you will feel this moment, as I hope and truſt the country at large will feel, that it is not in the power of the higheſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this country, be his ſituation what it may, to pack a Jury either here or in our ſiſter-kingdom, or to prevent the meaneſt criminal from getting what the law and the conſtitution of his country gives him; a juſt, a fair, and an impartial trial. I truſt you will feel at this moment, what I do in my ſituation as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor, a complete and perfect independence; a deſire to do my duty to my country at large; a determination to follow the dictates of my own conſcience, and when I exerciſe that to the beſt of my judgment and the beſt of my underſtanding, as I know and I truſt you will do this evening, I care not what is ſaid either by a criminal in the moment of intemperance, or by perſons without doors, endeavouring to ſhake the confidence which the people of the country have of the ineſtimable privilege of trial by Jury, I deny that Juries are packed, or that any inſtance has exiſted, or can poſſibly exiſt in this country, of ſo foul and ſo groſs an aſperſion being juſt.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I am not without ſome apprehenſions, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of an indiſpoſition which I have laboured under ſince I laſt addreſſed a Jury of this country upon a trial of a ſimilar na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. I am not yet perfectly without my apprehenſions, that I may not be able at this late hour of the night, and in a Court ſo crouded as this, to do what is on all occaſions my bounden duty, and which the peculiar ſituation of this country, at preſent, more particularly demands, to ſtate the nature of the evidence lying upon the table, joined to that which was read at the foot of it to day; that I may not be able to bring it in ſo conſpicuous a point of view, or diſcriminate with that accuracy in the volume of Factious, Seditious, and Treaſonable matter, which lies upon
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:027594_0083_0FD54DAF623F45E0"/>
your table, that which you ought to dwell upon, and that which you ought not; but I truſt in ſome degree to the goodneſs of my cauſe; I truſt more to the underſtanding of the Jury, and I truſt ſomething to that feeling of regard to my Country, and that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which a good and loyal ſubject ought to feel and to entertain, that I ſhall yet be able to make out ſuch a caſe from the evidence before you, which will impoſe upon you the ſevere, but the juſt, taſk of returning a verdict of guilty, againſt the perſon at your bar, upon the moſt ſolid, convincing, and concluſive proof that it is poſſible.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the Pannel at your bar ſtands charged with Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Upon that ſubject we have to-day had much diſcuſſion; we have had a great deal of ignorance profeſſed, by men who ſurely ought to have been the laſt to make that profeſſion, who hold themſelves out to their fellow ſubjects as Members of a Convention which is to teach reform to Parliament, which is to ſubſtitute ſomething better, in place of what we enjoy, who have audaciouſly pretended to aſſume to themſelves that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant taſk, and that important character, of ſetting aſide or of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving that inheritance which they enjoy from thoſe who have gone before them, and, who I ſincerely hope and wiſh attended with that propriety, and that degree of attention which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the importance of that taſk before they entered upon it, or before they pretended to be ignorant of what Sedition was.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, to refer to Law Books is perfectly unneceſſary; the Counſel who opened this Caſe to-day upon the part of the proſecution, traced his authority back to the earlieſt book which we know, or which the Law of Scotland acknowledges, the book of <hi>Regiam Majeſtatem;</hi> and if the Pannel at the Bar, or thoſe Members of the Britiſh Convention who have profeſſed to-day ſuch ignorance of what Sedition is, if they had turned up, I am ſorry to ſay, the only criminal book of the Law which we Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers acknowledge to be of authority, I mean, the book of Sir George Mackenzie, they would have found a ſeparate and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct treatiſe, defining expreſsly the crime of Sedition, giving it its technical definition as clearly as the definition of murder, falſehood, forgery, rape, or any other crime which occurs in the common courſe of criminal juriſprudence. If any ſet of men let their oſtenſive purpoſe be a redreſs of grievances, as in this caſe, till it aſſumed the appellation of the Britiſh Convention of the Delegates of the People, aſſociated to obtain univerſal ſuffrage and annual Parliaments, as was the caſe I ſay, of the former Convention, of which the boy Calder told us juſt now he had been a Member, if their purpoſe was reform; yet, if that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is not to addreſs the King or the Legiſlature of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in a conſtitutional way, by petition to the King; but if on the contrary, they are aping and imitating the example of a neighbouring Country with which we are at war, or if it goes
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:027594_0084_0FD7BFC970C031B0"/>
the length of convocating thouſands of perſons who may form theſe Societies, not to apply to King, Lords, and Commons, in a proper, legal, and conſtitutional way for redreſs; but if it does aſſume the power of forming itſelf into a ſeparate body, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention altogether; if it goes the length of what I will ſhew you, upon a fair review of the evidence, it did in this caſe, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awing Parliament in the execution of its duty; that in the event of an invaſion, or ſome ſuch ſimilar circumſtance, they were not only to control and overawe the proceedings of Parliament, but were, in the conſtruction of common ſenſe and reaſon, to join, in place of reſiſting the Invaders, for that is the concluſion which I ſhall draw from the evidence on the table, in ſpite of all the declarations and profeſſions which came from the Aſſociates of the Pannel this day at the bar: if it goes that length, it is clearly and diſtinctly the crime of Sedition, as clear and unequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal as ever occured in the practice of any civilized country. The evidence, therefore, Gentlemen, is now before you—I ſtate that to be my view of the caſe; that is the opinion which I form upon the review of it; my opinion is not binding upon you; but you will conſider thoſe parts of it, which it is now my duty to ſtate and comment upon: you will give to it your beſt atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and lay your hands upon your hearts, and conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is not the only, the plain, and the neceſſary deduction and inference, which ariſes not from any particular expreſſion, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, motion, or paper; but from a general complex view of the whole, tallying and comparing it at the ſame time with the parole teſtimony laid before you this day.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the evidence is of two kinds, written and parole: the principal and chief part of it (and I ſay ſo, becauſe it is the moſt certain and the moſt unerring), is the written evidence ariſing from the minutes of this ſelf-conſtituted Convention; from the papers found upon Mr. Margarot, contained and refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to in the general inventory upon the table, and from three numbers of the Gazetteer, which in the ſequel I ſhall ſhew you to be completely brought home to this Convention.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the firſt queſtion which you are to conſider is, whether or not this meeting, from the 19th of November (for I go no farther back) till the 4th of December laſt, where the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes ſtop, becauſe we all know, and it is proved to-day, that the Magiſtracy of this City, did, early on the morning of the 5th, apprehend theſe perſons and ſeize their papers. The firſt queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which you are to aſk is this: Was it or not a meeting of a ſeditious nature? for if you are of opinion, that it was not a meeting of a ſeditious nature; if you ſhould conſider it in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent point of view, to what I humbly preſume to do; that it was an innocent, fair, legal, and conſtitutional meaſure, it is in vain, ſuperfluous, and unneceſſary for you to enquire, whether the Pannel is a Principal Actor in that Meeting; becauſe no man can be found guilty of the proceedings of a Meeting which a jury
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:027594_0085_0FD7BFB926BA2F40"/>
ſhall be of opinion, is within the pale of the law, and ſuch as the laws of this Country entitle any man to call together.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, ſomething was ſaid to day, in the courſe of this debate (if I may ſo term it), that was perſonal againſt myſelf as a Member of another Convention; ſomething was ſaid with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the aſtoniſhing circumſtance, of not bringing the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough reformers to trial in this court, ſomething was ſaid alſo with apparent marks of exultation on the part of the pannel, that though three Conventions of the Friends of the People had taken place in this city, in the courſe of eighteen months paſt, no notice whatever was taken by the Public Proſecutor of any of thoſe Conventions, till, as Margarot, I think, ſtated, we took alarm; becauſe we ſaw, that he and his friends were in danger of opening the eyes of the people; that it was not till we were alarmed, and the eyes of the people were about to be opened, to the exiſtence of thoſe abuſes, which it was their object to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect; that I (negligent in my duty before) brought this man and others his aſſociates to anſwer for the offence.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, my anſwer is this: I deſire not to enter into the queſtion, how far Conventions by Delegation are, or not legal. —It is not the queſtion now under your conſideration; had theſe Gentlemen confined themſelves to what was the Law of their Country, or adhered to what they profeſſed to be the caſe, I ſhould not have felt it my duty to have brought them to trial, for being aſſembled in a Convention, or any thing of that kind, which had for its object either the correction of the County Laws, of the Borough Laws, or any other correction which the wildeſt or moſt unreaſonable ſpeculatiſt might think it worth his while to aim at.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I never thought of bringing before you the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of 1791, the Convention of April 1793, or the ſubſequent Convention in October laſt; nor did I think of bringing the perſons now charged before you with Sedition, till the very name they aſſumed, every advertiſement they inſerted in the papers, every thing verbal or written, demonſtrated to my mind, demonſtrated to Scotland, demonſtrated to England, and to the empire at large, that they were a ſet of French Convention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts.—I give them that name; perſons who, as far as they durſt, and their audacity I believe was matter of aſtoniſhment to the country at large, who durſt take poſſeſſion of this metropolis, who dared within its walls to hold out the example of a French model, holding out their example as the principle upon which they acted, as the objects and point to which their deliberations tended.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, ſomething was ſaid of orders being given to Mr. Davidſon, the Sheriff Subſtitute, that he acted by orders: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he acted by order or not, whether he acted by the orders of the reſpectable Gentleman who was Sheriff Depute of the County, but who has ſince received a diſtinguiſhing mark of his
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:027594_0086_0FD54DB3E90C50E8"/>
Sovereign's favour, whether he went by my orders, or by the orders of any body elſe, is nothing to the purpoſe; I did conſult with that Gentleman; I did conſult with your chief magiſtrate; I deſired them to attend to their duty; if any deſire of mine was neceſſary; we acted in concert together; had we done leſs, we had been guilty of a breach of office; we had been guilty of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting the moſt important intereſts of mankind.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, were I to run over every ſingle paper contained in that Inventory, were I to addreſs you upon every motion which appears in that ſcroll of Minutes before you, I ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you this evening to a very late hour indeed; but I ſhall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect a few of the moſt pointed and diſtinct motions, and evidence therein contained.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, it is an important duty in which you are now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged; the Pannel either is, or profeſſes himſelf to be, an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhman; he is in ſome reſpects a foreigner to this Country; but you will not conſider when you are to decide either upon the life, the reputation or the guilt, or innocence of a fellow creature, whether he is of Scotland, or whether he is of England.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I will ſay hardly a word in ſupport of the written evidence which is now upon your table—it appears that the papers libelled upon, which I have juſt deſcribed to you, are traced home in the moſt complete and ſatisfactory manner poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble—there is not a tittle of written evidence—there is not a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cument now before you which is not proved beyond a poſſibility of diſpute—I refer in general to the teſtimonies of Mr. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidſon; of Mr. Scott, the Fiſcal; Lyon, and I think Mack.— Theſe four, I believe, diſtinctly trace them from the room in which Margarot and Gerald ſlept into the ſheriff clerk's office, and having traced them there they are brought into court, and it is impoſſible to enquire further. Indeed ſome queſtion was put by the Pannel at the bar (who diſplayed I muſt admit a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable degree of ingenuity and acuteneſs in his own defence), as if it might have happened from the manner theſe papers were found, that others might have been carried in even by Lyon, the meſſenger—that other papers might have been carried in, as they were reſiding at a public inn in this city, by other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and that they were not neceſſarily the papers of Gerald, and of Margarot—In every caſe where written evidence is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled upon, in ſupport of any crime, I aſk yourſelves if it is poſſible to give better evidence of the identity of papers than was done in the preſent caſe—or if you ſuppoſe, contrary to evidence and contrary to fact, that Lyon, the meſſenger, was entruſted by Mr. Davidſon. or Mr. Pringle, or me, or the Lord Provoſt, with papers of a ſeditious nature, which he carried into that room where they were ſleeping, in order to ground a falſe accuſation againſt them—if you can ſuppoſe that poſſible then to be ſure any thing that I have ſaid, or have hereafter to ſay in ſupport of the charge againſt this man, certainly will not
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:027594_0087_0FD54DB628FE7220"/>
be worth attending to—Gentlemen, on the contrary, theſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers were found in the room where they ſlept, were put into a trunk, which trunk was returned back to Margarot and Gerald, and you have it in evidence, that when it was examined in their preſence, Gerald ſelected his—Margarot claimed the reſt, or at leaſt allowed them to be inventoried without denying them, and thoſe which did not relate to this buſineſs, were returned to them both.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen.—I truſt that quibbling defence, for it does not deſerve any other name, will ſatisfy your minds, that the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman does know that the import of theſe papers bears hard againſt him, and that he wiſhes to ſhelter himſelf from the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which your minds will drew, by ſtating a poſſibility, which cannot exiſt, that they might have been carried there by other people, in order to ground an accuſation againſt him.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, holding that to be clear, I ſhall beg your atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the firſt place, to the minutes of the convention, for it is the ground work, and the baſis of the charge againſt him; it was a paper which I was very anxious if poſſible to obtain, becauſe I know that it would have been impoſſible to have aſked a Jury to have given a verdict againſt any man upon ſuſpicious, however ſtrong thoſe ſuſpicious might have been, and you will be ſatisfied from what we ſaw this day, from the manner in which we ſaw the witneſſes give their teſtimony, Citizen Roſs particularly, who has ſpoke out; and I am ſure it gives me plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to applaud the conduct of a witneſs. I have great ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and high pleaſure in giving this tribute of praiſe to Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen Roſs, and the ſame with reſpect to Coborn, who, I think, from the whole of his teſtimony, though a friend and aſſociate of the Pannel at the bar, has given a fair, a true, and a deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive evidence.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the firſt thing I ſhall beg your attention to are the ſteps previous to and accompanying that which is ſtated in pages fifth and ſixth of the indictment. In page fifth you will obſerve ſtated a motion reſpecting a Convention of Emergency, and the caſes in which they were to meet are proved in the firſt place by the negative evidence of their minutes, and confirmed by the teſtimonies of Coborn and of George Roſs.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, that motion appears to have been firſt made by a gentleman of the name of Callendar, to whom this day was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively appropriated for meeting the juſtice of his country, but who it ſeems has not choſen to ſtand trial, and the firſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice given of this motion, I will read from the minutes—6th day's ſitting, 25th November 1793. Citizen Callendar moved, that in caſe the Miniſter bring into the Commons Houſe a motion for a convention bill, it ſhould be noticed immediately to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates. This is the firſt appearance of this motion in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, and as it was told us by ſeveral of the witneſſes to day, the forms of this houſe, as it is called, or of this Convention,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:027594_0088_0FD54DB7A7F58DA0"/>
did not admit of a motion made one day being deliberated upon till the next—the motion lies over accordingly till the enſuing day, when you will find the meeting again reſumed, and Callen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar's motion being then taken under conſideration, amendments were propoſed by ſeveral perſons, and it was moved by Mr. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garot, that a committee conſiſting of the mover, ſeconder, and thoſe that had moved for amendments, be appointed to draw up a motion that may meet the idea of all, among whom was Mr. Calder, the young gentleman whoſe actual attendance upon the Univerſity may perhaps better qualify him to diſcuſs queſtions as to the reform (or as I call it the alteration) of the conſtitution, than the learned Mr. John Clark, or Mr. Wardlaw, or Mr. Ait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſon, or any of thoſe gentlemen who have ſo well weighed and conſidered the ancient inſtitutions of the laws and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their country, before they aſſumed to themſelves the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant office which they have taken upon them. Citizen John Gartley moves, that the ſenſe of the houſe be taken upon the ſpirit of the motion, upon the words of the motion, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards upon Mr. Margarot's motion. Upon the firſt motion it was carried unanimouſly to adopt the motion as to its ſpirit; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by a great majority not to adopt the words of it; and, thirdly, that the amendments be referred to a committee as above—And at a ſubſequent diet, I mean a ſubſequent ſitting of the Convention, the minutes tells us, that Citizen Sinclair read the amendments upon Citizen Callendar's motion, as agreed upon by the committee, and it was agreed, upon the motion of Citizen Blank, that the houſe ſhould reſolve itſelf into a commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee for its mature conſideration. In the courſe of the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Citizen Brown gave a hiſtory of the habeas corpus act. After an excellent diſcuſſion of the queſtion, pertinent remarks and amendments, the convention was reſumed, and the whole as amended, being read over, the members ſtood upon their feet, and ſolemnly and unanimouſly paſſed the reſolution as follows— Then follows a blank in the paper, and immediately afterwards the minutes proceed, at the diſtance of a page, and ſomewhat more, that Citizen Gerald in a very energetic, and animated ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, expreſſed his happineſs at the motion paſſed, and Citizen Brown, followed him in a manly ſpeech, and proved the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the executive government over the Parliament. Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Margarot then read and propoſed the following motion: That a ſecret committee of three, and the ſecretary, (it is proved afterwards that Clark, Margarot, Skirving, and Brown, were the four who actually compoſed this committee) be appointed to determine the place where ſuch Convention of Emergency ſhould meet, that ſuch place ſhould remain a ſecret with them, and with the ſecretary of the Convention, and that each delegate ſhall, at the breaking up of the preſent ſeſſion, be entruſted with a ſealed letter, containing the name of the place of meeting; this letter ſhall be delivered unopened to his conſtituents, the receipt of
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:027594_0089_0FD7BFCAED1083A8"/>
which ſhall be acknowledged by a letter to the ſecretary, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the ſame ſtate, until the period ſhall arrive at which it ſhall be deemed neceſſary for the delegate to ſet off.—This mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſeconded by Citizen Moffatt, and carried unanimouſly.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, you have in the firſt place this proved completely by the minutes, that Citizen Callendar in his firſt motion, which was adopted as to its ſpirit, but rejected as to its words, had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more nor leſs than this object in view, that as ſoon as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſhould think it neceſſary or proper, if they ever thought it neceſſary or proper, to bring in a ſimilar bill, to that which paſſed in Ireland, that this ſhould be the ſignal, or notification for calling the Convention of Emergency together, and that of itſelf without going to other caſes of Emergency, was juſt this, that they were to act as a control upon parliament, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to overawe (you will conſider whether in a legal or in an illegal way) the free exerciſe of the right of the legiſlature— Can you ſuppoſe that if their purpoſe was legal, if they had not wiſhed to overawe, and intimidate the parliament from doing their duty, would you have found them alarmed or afraid of their conduct? Had their purpoſe been only to petition par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and to ſtate their remonſtrances againſt ſuch a motion (a right, which every freeman of this country poſſeſſes) what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation is to be given of that ſecrecy in which this meaſure is wrapped up, if their purpoſe was honeſt, but is it ſo? you find in this paper an account of a reſolution which they came to, in a moſt ſolemn and moſt unanimous manner, but which reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion does not appear in the face of the minutes—if it was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution merely of the quiet and loyal nature juſt now ſtated, do you ſuppoſe that motion would have been left out, or do you believe what Aitcheſon tells you, and in which he is confirmed by the minutes in Roſs's hand writing, for Roſs's hand writing ends immediately before the blank, and Aitcheſon's comes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the blank—is it not clearly proved that what they were about was a thing which they durſt not put into this paper, which they poſtponed to ſome other occaſion, which Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clair, as Aitcheſon tells you, propoſed ſhould be burnt, but which he reſiſted ſucceſsfully, and prevented it from being burned? burning an innocent paper is not the characteriſtic of men of virtue—of men of character—of men conſcious they were only doing what was legal, and what was juſt.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, let us then ſee what the parole teſtimony makes out, and whether it does not preciſely confirm the concluſion, and inferences. I am now drawing not only from what is proved by the minutes, but alſo from what is not proved by the minutes, I mean the inſertion of this extraordinary blank, to which there is nothing ſimilar, except a blank of four lines, in all the 94 pages of minutes upon your table.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, Coburn, I think, tells you, that beſides this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention bill, there were a variety of other caſes in which this
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:027594_0090_0FD54DBAB71201D8"/>
Convention of Emergency were to meet: He told us that they all agreed that the introduction of a convention bill was to be one great object when the people ſhould meet, and I wiſh you would look at your notes when the people ſhould meet <hi>to aſſert their rights</hi>—I am not to deſcend to criticiſms upon a word, but I may at leaſt beg to know whether, if it was merely drawing up a reſpectful petition to the King or to the parliament, it was neceſſary to put ſo ſtrong a declaration as this to which Coburn ſwears, or was it not better to ſpeak out the truth, that they meant, in ſuch an event, to remonſtrate againſt the meaſure, or petition Parliament againſt its paſſing into a law? but you have, on the contrary, an expreſſion which favours more of reſiſtance than any thing elſe—that they were to meet in this unknown place, which was to be concealed even from the delegates them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and of courſe from they eye of the executive power— that in that event they were to meet and aſſert their rights, but as to the manner in which they were to be aſſerted, whether in a peaceable or tumultuous way, whether the mild influence of reaſon was to be exerciſed upon the Britiſh Parliament, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by drawing out numbers of deluded men to do it by force, is your buſineſs now to decide, and your province alone to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen—The queſtion was this day put to me, was I an inquiſitor of the private feelings of men's minds? Had I a right to dive into the ſecrets of the human breaſt, or to diſcover what it was their intention to conceal?—That is the province of the Jury—it is their buſineſs, however careful men involved in ſeditious practices may be to gild them over with general ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, ſuch as aſſembling to aſſert their rights; it is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of the Jury, when they find perſons engaged in theſe practices, not to take their profeſſions, not to take what they declare to be the oſtenſible purpoſe in view, but looking to their actions, looking to their words, looking to their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, whether they are ſecret, or whether they are public, to form your impartial determination on which ſide the ſcale of evidence preponderates, whether it is on the ſide of innocence, or whether it does not tally with guilt alone; whether it does not artfully and inſidiouſly leave it open either to one conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or the other; for if they had ſaid that they would have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted their rights by open force, if they had durſt to have ſaid the Britiſh Parliament ſhall defend the Habeas Corpus Act, or we will defend it by force of arms, if in caſe of a French invaſion, their purpoſe was not to reſiſt but to co-operate with ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion, and had they expreſſed that upon their minutes, I would not have brought Mr. Margarot to trial, I ſhould have held him a lunatic in every ſenſe of the word.—If I had brought him to trial before you, I am poſitive you would have thought I had brought a madman to your bar; you might have pronounced a verdict of lunacy againſt him, but certainly would not have
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:027594_0091_0FD54DBC21D37068"/>
thought him a proper object of puniſhment. But, Gentlemen, we have in this country a powerful Executive Government;—we have laws which control that power, and we have a Jury which can check it in its progreſs in a moment; but we are to expect, while that Executive Government exiſts (which I truſt will exiſt to all eternity to check every attempt of this kind) that ſeditious words will be ambiguous and doubtful upon the face of them; and when you find that Mr. Margarot, the Pannel, is a man of conſiderable ability, that he is a man aware of what he is about, that he is the ringleader of theſe perſons,—of that poor unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate ſet of creatures who came this day to your bar—of boys —of perſons intoxicated, as you have ſeen—that he profeſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a merchant; that the trade in which he is engaged permits him, from motives of pure diſintereſtedneſs, public ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritedneſs, and wiſhing to extend bleſſings to Scotland, which he thinks we do not poſſeſs, for ſix weeks to dedicate his whole time and abilities to thoſe objects which he has held forth to you as not only fair but juſtifiable; that he is the former of theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, the maker of theſe motions, the ringleader of theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded people, who are ignorant of the commoneſt principles of the conſtitution, and who know at this moment as little of it as if they had never been members of a Britiſh Convention—I ſay when you recollect this, you will not expect any thing elſe but ſuch an artful, inſidious, and ambiguous mode of expreſſion, as may admit with perfect ſafety either the one or the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, but which I ſhall ſhew you in the ſequel can be conſtrued alone into guilt, and eſtabliſhes only this, that Mr. Margarot knew what he was about, that they eye of the Executive Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of this country was over him, he profeſſed, and he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidiouſly and artfully, along with Mr. Sinclair, in this abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble committee to which the matter was referred, did give it that general ambiguous expreſſion, becauſe he durſt not do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and becauſe, which is clear from the evidence of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, and from the evidence of Coburn, it was ſuch a paper as they durſt not blot their minutes with; it was ſuch a paper as they durſt not hold their face to; it was ſuch a paper as was to give riſe to a committee of ſecrecy, where, if the thing was right, ſecrecy was inconſiſtent; but where, if it was wrong, it was prudent, it was neceſſary, it was proper.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the next thing I ſhall obſerve upon is thoſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Gazetteer which are now upon the table. Citizens of Edinburgh, I uſe the word Citizen, I hope and I know in a fair and in a legal ſenſe, you cannot be ignorant of the Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh Gazetteer. Sure I am I have the honour to be moſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately acquainted with it, and it has done me the honor to be moſt intimately acquainted with me.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, let us look to that paper, and though ſome ſlur may perhaps for a moment ariſe either in your minds, or in the minds of thoſe who hear me, as to the authenticity of a newſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paper
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:027594_0092_0FD54DBDA92084C8"/>
as matter of evidence, I will ſhew you, from the evidence of the minutes upon the table, that it is, what it was meant to be, an authentic account, and that as far as it goes it ſtates no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what really and truly was the ſubſtance of what paſſed in the Convention. I ſhould not ſuppoſe that the Jury would think me abſurd enough to call them to idle paragraphs in a newſpaper, if it had not ſome degree of authenticity. I refer you to the evidence of the Roſſes, who tell you that the minutes were taken down in ſhort-hand for the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, as to that of which Mr. Margarot complains, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apprehended ſo early in the morning, I ſhould have no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to take upon myſelf the blame; it was done for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of getting at Mr. Skirving and him, and all of them, at a moment when they were not looking for us, otherwiſe they might deſtroy that evidence which I knew exiſted of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and from that providential circumſtance, theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes were ſeized in Mr. Skirving's poſſeſſion, which were a compleat evidence againſt him. I am entitled to ſay ſo, becauſe the Jury have ſaid ſo, which is a material circumſtance againſt the Pannel, or againſt any perſon who either is or ſhall be tried for his acceſſion to the proceedings of thoſe meetings. It was proved that after waiting ſome time for the four deputies, the repreſentatives, as I thought at firſt, of all England, but I find they are only the repreſentatives of many thouſands in London, many thouſands in Norwich, and many thouſands in Sheffield and different parts of the country, and theſe four gentlemen, the Engliſh delegates, came down here, it was thought ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant an occaſion, that the Convention, which had been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed for ſome days, again reſumed itſelf; and, gentlemen, they told us that they ſupported the Gazetteer, not as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, not in their corporate capacity, which I was ſurprized to hear ſtated, and it cannot be ſtated by Mr. Margarot, I have a different opinion of his abilities, it cannot be ſtated by him that he is not liable for the proceedings of the Convention; it is clear, from other parts of the evidence, that the Gazetteer is ſo far an authentic account of their proceedings, that they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported it as individuals, and wiſhed it well, as I believe they do with all their hearts and with all their ſouls.</p>
               <p>Now, Gentlemen, let us look to this Gazetteer, and let us ſee how far it ſupplies any blank which may ariſe upon the peruſal of the minutes regarding this extraordinary Convention, and you will ſee that it effectually does ſo, for you will find that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution which Mr. Aitcheſon did not wiſh to have burnt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he thought their conduct was open and avowed, and what the world had a right to know; you find that the Pannel at the bar was wiſely and prudently of an oppoſite opinion; for it ſays, after ſtating the proceedings of the Wedneſday, on which Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Mealmaker is in the chair, and where Mr. Callendar's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is rejected as to words, but approved of as to the ſpirit of it;
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:027594_0093_0FD7BFBBED59BDC0"/>
and the next day, when the reſolution comes to be new <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it ſays Citizen Sinclair, Citizen Preſident, your commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee appointed to attend Citizen Callendar's motion ſat this forenoon, and I ſhall now, if agreeable to the Convention, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to their conſideration the report of that committee. Fellow Citizens, you will feel this report to be of the laſt importance; it claims your moſt ſerious attention, and is to be decided by your united wiſdom, and ſupported by your united integrity. The houſe reſolved itſelf into a grand committee to conſider of the report, which underwent a long diſcuſſion, and reviewed ſeveral amendments in the committee, and when the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was reſumed, it paſſed unanimouſly in the form of a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and reſolution: the minutes proved that reſolution was come to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but being ordered to ſtand the laſt article in the record of the proceedings of the Convention, we cannot inſert it till the termination of the preſent ſeſſion.</p>
               <p>That is the account in the Gazetteer, the myſtery of the blank is ſo far cleared up, if Mr. Aitcheſon is to be believed, that this was what Mr. Sinclair wiſhed to bu<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>n, you have it in a faithful account of the proceedings in the Gazetteer, that it was to be left out till the termination of the preſent ſeſſion. You will conſider if the hand of the magiſtrate had not been raiſed to ſtop their proceedings in the very middle of their career, whether it is poſſible that ſuch a reſolution as this would even at the end of the proceedings have ever made its appearance. But Roſs tells you, he concurs exactly in the ſame thing, that this reſolution ought to have been in the blank in the minutes, and therefore you have this diſtinctly proved, that reſolutions of a certain nature were come to in a ſolemn and deliberate manner, unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly and ſolemnly in this Convention, which one man ſays Mr. Sinclair moved ſhould be deſtroyed, and which ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſays, and the Gazetteer confirms, was to be poſtponed to the end of the ſeſſion, and which have never made their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and therefore the blank is completely explained; but you have better evidence yet, you have the evidence of Coborn and Roſs, to almoſt every thing ſtated in page five of the indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I deſire, when you read that indictment, that you will lay out of your view altogether every thing but what is proved; every thing but what is ſufficient evidence—You are to look at the teſtimony of Coborn, you are to look at the teſtimony of Roſs, you are to look at the Gazetteer, and to a ſpeech which I ſhall read this moment, and which tally ſo far as they go with the minutes, and if you are of opinion that that reſolution, ſo far as it is proved, is one of a lawful nature, if you are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that it is not of a direct ſeditious, nay of a treaſonable ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, for if it had been followed by one ſingle act, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it, if under that reſolution it had been proved that this Convention of Emergency had met, if it had been proved that they aſſembled under theſe circumſtances of ſecrecy, in any
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:027594_0094_0FD54DC0DB6609C0"/>
of the caſes which I ſhall juſt now ſhew you are proved, the perſons who met would have been guilty of on overt act of high treaſon, under the ſtatute of Edward III. which by the act of the 7th Queen Ann, is now the treaſon law of Scotland.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I beg your attention to the words in the indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: it ſtates that the Convention, <q>conſidering the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous conſequences of any act of the Legiſlature which may tend to deprive the whole or any part of the people of their undoubted right to meet either by themſelves, or by delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to diſcuſs any matter relative to their common intereſt, whether of a public or private nature; and holding the ſame to be totally inconſiſtent with the firſt principles and ſafety of ſociety, and alſo ſubverſive of our known and acknowledged conſtitutional liberties, do hereby declare, before God and the world, that we ſhall follow the wholeſome example of former times, by paying no regard to any act which may mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate againſt the conſtitution of our country; and ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to aſſemble and conſider of the beſt means by which we can accompliſh a real repreſentation of the people and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual election, until compelled to deſiſt by ſuperior force.</q>— This is not proved in words; but in a certain extent it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely proved by the teſtimony of Coburn, by the teſtimony of Roſs, by the minutes and by the Gazetteer; for Mr. Coburn tells you, he remembers Mr. Callendar moving, that in caſe of a Bill being brought into Parliament ſimilar to the Iriſh Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Bill, that the people ſhould meet and aſſert their rights: afterwards the ſpirit of the motion was retained, but extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to certain other events, in which the Convention ſhould likewiſe meet in caſe of the ſuſpenſion of the habeas corpus act, in caſe of an invaſion, and in caſe of landing foreign troops. A moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was made for a committee to appoint a place where the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Emergency were to meet, which was to be a ſecret with them and the Secretary. He remembers Mr. Sinclair's motion being come to with peculiar ſolemnity, and that the words before God and the world were uſed either in the motion or in the deciſive reſolution; he is certain it was in one or the other. He recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects he ſaid they would pay no regard to any ſuch Bill, if it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or words to that purpoſe. I have the teſtimony of Coburn, of whoſe reſpectability I leave you to judge, deponing to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial parts of the indictment, that they were to meet to aſſert their rights, that they would pay no regard any ſuch Bill, if paſſed; and if they were to pay no regard to the Act, if paſſed, were they not guilty of an act of rebellion againſt the ſtate, when they tell you, that if the Britiſh Legiſlature conſiſting of King, Lords, and Commons, ſhould paſs ſuch an Act, if, in the plenitude of their wiſdom, they ſhould think it right to do what Ireland has before thought it neceſſary to do; and God forbid that, without any declaratory ſtatute, there ſhould not be law in Scotland to find men guilty of daring to put into a paper
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:027594_0095_0FD7BFCC6D410D70"/>
words of the import that Coburn has ſworn to, that they would pay no regard to any ſuch Act; the inference follows neceſſarily and unavoidably, though not proved, until compelled by ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior force. Will you permit this, Gentlemen, let their conduct in life be ever ſo unimpeached; I impeach none of them. God forbid I ſhould look down upon the ſhoemaker, or the mechanic, or conſider him as leſs entitled to reſpect in his walk of life, than the proudeſt peer that lives in this country. I wiſh that they, be they of what rank they may, would dwell with a little attention, and conſider with care and accuracy the nature of the Conſtitution which they enjoy, ere they raſhly attempt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to invade its authority, as they have done here, or attempt to ſubſtitute their own crude ideas, and prefer one of their own idle imaginations. Whatever be the caſe with Mr. Margarot, I don't think he has that knowledge of the Conſtitution; ſure I am, he has not that knowledge of law, after what I have heard to-day. I know nothing of him; but ſure I am, from what I did ſee of him, I cannot think, and I ſhould be ſorry that the fifteen men I now addreſs ſhould think, that the Conſtitution was ſafely confided to ſuch men in the line of life in which theſe men are; they cannot be fit for that duty which the Hiſtory of the World ſhews has been with difficulty diſcharged by legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators of the higheſt characters, and of the firſt abilities. Go back to ages paſt, you will read of men who formed a ſtate, and gave rules for its legiſlation, were raiſed to the rank of heathen gods; you will read of men who, by forming a conſtitution, and regulating its proceedings, obtained characters and names as eternal as the world itſelf, will theſe men be entitled to come forward, like Calder, who is placed in the univerſity? Will theſe men be entitled to ſtate themſelves as perſons holding out to ſuch poor deluded creatures that they are fitted to enter on ſubjects of that nature? That this country, conſiſting of ten mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of people, is to delegate the taſk of legiſlation to ſuch a ſet of ignorant uninformed people—ignorant of the common prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of law and juſtice, talking of books they never read, and declaiming upon ſubjects they know nothing of? It may indeed tend, and here I am ſpeaking directly to the point of criminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Pannel, if he was an attorney, which I don't know that he was, he has made an ill-uſe of his profeſſion; his crimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is without excuſe; his guilt is indeed of a more atrocious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. What is ſedition but this; a convocating of ignorant, weak, and deluded people, under the pretext of redreſſing grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of any kind, and inflaming them againſt the Conſtitution and the eſtabliſhed authority of their country. But this is the direct fact proved againſt Mr. Margarot, it is the point diſtinctly brought home to him; and under ſuch circumſtances of reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, inculcated upon the part of theſe ringleaders, which in my mind, and I truſt in yours, will ſatisfy you that guilt was in his mind when he did ſo, and will entitle you to lay your hands
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:027594_0096_0FD7BFC06D13E6D8"/>
upon your hearts and ſay, that he is guilty of endeavouring to ſpread the contagion wide among people who knew not what they were about; which if they had followed his advice, if they had roſe into tumult and diſorder, might have brought them to an untimely end; and perhaps theſe three days paſt may afford ſome idea of what might be the purpoſe of aſſembling ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons together, if they had been aſſembled by Mr. Margarot as a Convention of Emergency; if they had been told by him, now is the time to aſſert your rights. I aſſume, that theſe three days paſt within this city will ſhew us what was the nature of that object which Mr. Margarot had in view, and what the purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and what the manner in which in ſuch an event they might have carried their ſchemes into execution.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I have now gone through every thing upon this part of the indictment; and certainly in arguing, and being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to quote conſiderably from papers, I muſt have gone long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er into the caſe than I had any idea of; but I truſt I ſhall, before I ſit down, in a few words, go through what remains, and prove to your ſatisfaction, that every part of the libel is clearly and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly proved.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, Coburn tells you, that he thought the Iriſh Bill ſapped the very vitals of the Conſtitution of the Country; and he ſays it was to be kept a ſecret. If any illegal power inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted their meeting, that is the reaſon he gives for the ſecrecy; that is to ſay, that if either the magiſtracy of this city, or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament itſelf, or any ſuch inimical power, they being clearly the perſons to whom he alludes, are the cauſe of the ſecrecy; and it is all I aſk from him. You will conſider whether it is not juſt the thing I am ſtating as the point in their view, that they were keeping it ſecret from thoſe whoſe duty it was to check it, and prevent the conſequence that might ariſe from it.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the caſe of an invaſion I have already ſtated to you was one of the caſes under which the Convention was to meet, and I ſhall not repeat what I have ſaid upon that ſubject; but I truſt that you will think with me, that the only and the neceſſary concluſion is that which I have already ſtated to you.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, having done with that part of the caſe, I come to the next, which I obſerved in the courſe of my examination, and which I alſo obſerved in the courſe of the Pannel's ſpeech upon the ſubject, ſeemed to be treated with very conſiderable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; and Mr. Aitcheſon, a determined and bold-faced gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, told you his opinions in very ſtrong, forcible terms. He expreſſed his idea, that the law of the country was come to a ſad paſs. Indeed he did not underſtand ſedition neither. And he was a man, from what I have ſeen of his abilities, I ſhould have expected he would have known a little more upon the ſubject than Wardlaw or Clarke knew upon the ſubject. But he did not know what ſedition was; but he tells you, that the law of the country was come to a ſad paſs indeed, when the word citizen,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:027594_0097_0FD7BFCDED10D5B0"/>
which he gloried in, was to conſtitute a man criminal. And he told you, that the principles of this Convention were carried on in the ſame way, or very little different, from thoſe which marked the proceedings and conduct of the former Convention. If they were, all I can ſay is this, that theſe former Conventions kept their proceedings very much a ſecret; for if I had known that they had done ſo, or come to any reſolutions ſimilar to thoſe proved to day againſt this man, the members of that Convention ſhould before now have ſtood before the Jury of their country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. If they did ſo, then all that I have to ſay is, that they were more cautious, or they perhaps did not think that the time was quite ripe to expreſs what they have ſince expreſſed. To be ſure, the term citizen, taken by itſelf, is an innocent and a proper term; I have uſed it to-night: we are all fellow-citizens here to-night. And the word tocſin, whether it comes from France, or whether it comes from China, or any where elſe, I feel nothing criminal in that term taken by itſelf; nor in the firſt year of Britiſh liberty; nor indeed the decades, which by the by I find in one of the plans for the ſupport of the Gazetteer, that it ſhall be divided into decades, and that each decade ſhall take ſo many copies of the Gazetteer, that is a Latin word; nor the firſt ſitting; in the ſame way all the other expreſſions, which I will not run over, taken by themſelves, are ſurely and unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably innocent; we all may uſe them in an innocent ſenſe, without the ſmalleſt apprehenſion, or the ſmalleſt blame. But here is the point, Gentlemen, upon which I found the charge of criminality; 'tis for this purpoſe that I collect theſe expreſſions, occurring in the proceedings of theſe minutes; and I collect them as links in the chain of evidence, to ſhew that this man has been guilty of apeing and imitating the French Convention, as acting upon that model and that principle, as in the ſame way was done laſt year in Ireland, and was the cauſe of the Iriſh Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament paſſing that act; it is a prooof of the animus and the intent of the perſons concerned in that meeting, that they took for themſelves the model and example of the preſent Convention of France, imitating it in every way in their power; and the concluſion is irreſiſtible, that if they durſt have gone forward, or if an invaſion had taken place, we might have found theſe men joining that band of invaders, whom we find them imitating and accommodating all their forms to, you will conſider with your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, laying your hands upon your hearts, can you, when you find in making it a caſe or emergency, under which they were to meet in a place ſecret to all the world, which might be here, or might be in England, the rallying point where the Executive Power of the country could not diſcover them; can you heſitate one moment in thinking as I think, and as I believe, that if ſuch an event had taken place, that men who form themſelves upon that model, and aſſumed as far as in them lay, and, as far as they
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:027594_0098_0FD7BFF12D20BFE8"/>
durſt the expreſſions of the French Convention, with which we are at preſent at war, and by whom we are threatened with that invaſion, would have gone againſt the perſons who were their own objects of imitation? or ſhould we have found them endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to eſtabliſh that which they have ſo ſucceſsfully eſtabliſhed in that country, univerſal ſuffrage, one of the great objects for which this Convention was eſtabliſhed?</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, you cannot expect written evidence of what paſſed in their minds, until the evil is gone to ſuch an height, until the invaſion has taken place, till the tumult or the inſurrection has happened, which theſe men have endeavoured to foment. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition then would no longer be the crime: treaſon would be the ſhape it would then aſſume: it would then be the duty of every free and loyal ſubject to join hand in hand againſt theſe invaders, whom we have found in the moment of that invaſion aſſembling in a ſecret place, as the delegates of thouſands, and whom we find proving themſelves by every act by which it was poſſible to prove themſelves, to be the ſupporters and imitators of the French Convention. I call them French Conventioniſts: It is the eſſence of the charge againſt them: it is the point upon which I deſire your attention. If they were the mere innocent Convention, or Aſſembly, or Aſſociation, or Society for Reform in Parliament, be their reform never ſo abſurd, or the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their meeting never ſo ineffectual for the object, I ſay God forbid you ſhould find them guilty to the extent of the moſt trifling puniſhment which you can fix upon them; but if you find them directly avowing in equivocal and doubtful terms, that an invaſion ſhall be one of the caſes in which they ſhall aſſemble, not to ſay that which would be the glory of a loyal ſubject, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice their live and fortunes to reſiſt the invaders; but if we find them, inſtead of that, ſhewing their predilection for French forms, and I truſt in God all they can be able to do, it is your duty and your province to dive into the receſſes of the human mind, to conſider the influence which ariſes from ſuch proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to conſider, if you will not lay the hand of criminal juſtice upon them, to quell the conſpiracy before it burſts into light; or if the deluded people, I ſpeak of the inhabitants of this city, I ſpeak of the inhabitants of Scotland at large, and of what has paſſed within theſe three or four days, are ſo much in the power of theſe ſtrangers who have lately come amongſt us, are to come in an unuſual mode to a court of criminal juſtice either to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awe that court, the proſecutor, or the jurymen; if they are to be indulging in unfair and ſcandalous aſperſions, as that of packed juries, as that of impoſing upon your underſtandings, it is for you to interfere and check the evil in its bud; now is the time, this is the moment for you to mark the diſapprobation of their proceedings, and ſtop them, while it remains with a feature of ſedition marked upon it verging upon treaſon, with ſuch a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling diſtinction, that it is almoſt impoſſible for a lawyer to find
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:027594_0099_0FD54DC9172D45F8"/>
the difference. It ſo little, that when the indictment was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred againſt Mr. Margarot, had it not been for the ſpeed with which it was neceſſary to bring him before you, I ſhould have laid the caſe before the King's counſel in England, as to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of a ſecret committee, which was ſubſequent to the reſolution of calling the Convention together, whether that <hi>per ſe</hi> was not ſufficient to ground the charge of high-treaſon. Sure I am, but for the act of the 7th of Queen Anne, that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen were far within the caſe of Scotch treaſons; and in that caſe Mr. Margarot would have ſtood at your bar tried for his life.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, before I ſit down, let me return again to the evidence. Mr. Roſs, I think George tells you, that he had heard of a Convention Bill, and of a number of Heſſians and Hanoverians to be landed in this country, that alſo was a caſe when it was proper for the Convention to meet at the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret place of meeting, that is to ſay, and it is the caſe at this moment, I believe, that a body of Heſſians are paſſing towards France. If Parliament ſhould chooſe to allow them to land upon this iſland, this was an objection of legiſlation; not that we could confide to the wiſdom of King, Lords, and Commons, but the Britiſh Convention for univerſal ſuffrage was to decide alone what was to be done; a caſe much of the ſame kind with the other, even in the way that Mr. Roſs himſelf ſtates it. But I will not wound the feelings of that worthy citizen (and I truſt that he hears me), by ſaying, that he concealed the truth, I will not ſay that; but he has forgot that mighty event which his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Coburn ſwore to, which muſt have ſtruck the mind and ears of every man who heard it; but his memory is a frail one, and with that obſervation I leave him.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, we are now coming near to a cloſe. You will find a variety of other evidence, much of the ſame nature in number three of the inventory. You will find one of the docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments material to be attended to in conſidering this queſtion, Whether the Convention is a ſeditious or a fair Convention? for that is the giſt of the queſtion which you are to try, and upon which you are to make up your mind. Now theſe papers are traced home to the poſſeſſion of Mr. Margarot. Mr. Aitcheſon, in his character of Aſſiſtant Secretary to the Convention, iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies a paper to which he tells you in this Convention he put his ſubſcription 'Hints on the queſtion of union;' and in the inſide are three or four different papers, which the witneſſes who made the ſearch ſwear were incloſed in it, and all relate to the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame ſubject; and the only other odd circumſtance which was thought of ſo much conſequence in this caſe was, in that ſolemn way the appointment of that committee of union, of which Mr. Margarot was the chairman.</p>
               <p>He appears to be the leader of this committee of union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween England and Scotland; a union which theſe Gentlemen, it ſeems, had authority to make; a union which we unfortunately
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:027594_0100_0FD54DCA62BACAF8"/>
have been deceived, as well as our fathers, in dreaming that we poſſeſſed a union that we thought we had enjoyed ſince the year 1707, which Mr. Aitcheſon told us was nothing like the union brought about by this convention, with ſo much ſolemnity; a wild ſycophant union, I think, he called it; and Mr. Margarot is the perſon who takes the active part in this committee. Let us ſee what it amounts to. I ſhall take the paper itſelf which Paterſon, a man who, much to his credit, has ſeceded from that meeting: he, as the head of his ſection, admits that the paper was drawn up in his ſection, and was by him ſent in a letter to the Convention. Mr. Margarot deſired to know, How are you certain that paper was in the Convention? I will tell Mr. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garot how I am certain of it. Mr. Aitcheſon ſubſcribes it at the back, "Hints reſpecting the Union;" and ſays, it muſt be put upon that paper in its reception; where Mr. Paterſon tells you, he ſent it in the common form from his ſection, which met in the morning, to the Convention, which met in the evening, and of which Mr. Aitcheſon was Aſſiſtant Secretary; and there is no reaſon to ſuppoſe that it did not reach the place of its deſtination, the Maſons' Lodge, at the foot of the Black Friars Wynd. And what is it; "Hints upon the queſtion of Union." Firſt, That the people of Great Britain, diſclaiming any diſtinction of Scotch and Engliſh do now and for ever unite themſelves into one maſs and indiſſoluble union. Then it goes on, Make known to all concerned, in excluſive terms, that this ſhall be the motto:— Reſtoration of Rights. What rights? Univerſal ſuffrage and annual parliaments; a thing that never did, and that never can, exiſt. Let them go back to the Hiſtory of England; let them go back to the deepeſt antiquity, it never did exiſt. Thoſe people, of whom Mr. Margarot ſeems to be the ghoſtly father, had not heard of the Bill of Rights, nor the claim of rights; and knew not what rights they had loſt.</p>
               <p>And, Gentlemen, I have been taught by every writer of the laws of foreign countries; I have been taught by every enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened foreigner who writes upon the ſubject; I have been taught by every Briton who ever ſtated an opinion with regard to it, that ſince the revolution, this country, originally free, reſiſted every invader, till gradually matured through centuries, by the ſlow mellowing hand of time, not by aſſociations of ſuch people as we have ſeen to-day, but it was clear that at that time, and till within theſe two years, we were the freeſt nation upon the face of the earth; but if it be neceſſary to conſtitute freedom that univerſal ſuffrage, or annual parliaments—that univerſal ſuffrage was a kind of proof of being free, we never have been free from all eternity, and are not free at this preſent moment. I hope in God, in that ſenſe we never ſhall, becauſe that never can take place, for the beſt of all poſſible reaſons, as I believe the late Soame Jenyns ſays. It is the beſt plan of the whole, ſays he, for the beſt of all poſſible reaſons, becauſe it is impracticable
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:027594_0101_0FD7BFF2ACEEE630"/>
                  <stage>(goes on reading the paper)</stage> that all occurrences may be known from one end of the kingdom to the other, to inſtruct every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual of this one great but indiviſible maſs, in this way greeting together the inhabitants of this free country, France, to reject that mighty combination formed againſt them. Still they run upon the French expreſſions in every part of their minutes, in every ſpeech in their Gazetteer, continually recurring to French words, French terms, and French expreſſions. In another mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by James Gartlay, which Aitcheſon volunteered in telling me was not evidence againſt Mr. Margarot, but it proves being found upon his perſon, it proves the nature of that convention, of which he was not only a member, but an active leading in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, it is alſo marked upon the back by Aitcheſon, and this motion is that the delegation ſigned John Gartley, who is the town drummer of Arniſton near Glaſgow, that the Convention took into their ſerious conſideration the neceſſity of dividing the country into departments, in order that the friends of the people may have an opportunity of meeting in the particular depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to which they belong, and thus form a ſort of Provincial Convention, that they may become more particularly acquainted with each other. In the names of the delegates, James Gartley.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the honour of the ſitting appears to be given by the French Convention, to perſons they wiſh to favour, ſo we find in the minutes, among other inſignia of the honours of the Britiſh Convention, Secretary Skirving ſtated, that he had juſt now received five ſhillings from an unknown hand, for the uſe of the Convention. Honourable mention in the minutes was ordered to be made of this patriotic gift. Upon my word I never was in the French Convention, and I hope I never ſhall, but I ſhould have ſuppoſed, from what I read in the newſpapers, that I was reading of the French Convention in Paris. Citizen Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar moved, that no perſon be allowed the honour of the ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, without the recommendation of two perſons; it is a favour not to be beſtowed raſhly or lightly; which, with amendments, paſſed unanimouſly. Afterwards it was moved that captain Johnſtone, and I am extremely ſorry to find him here, if he is the individual to whom I allude at preſent, becauſe it may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps compel other proceedings againſt him: but when he read an account in the newſpaper of the ſentence of Holt, the printer, of Newark, for re-printing the duke of Richmond's and Mr. Pitt's reſolutions upon parliamentary reform, it was moved, that Captain Johnſtone be admitted to the honours of the ſitting.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, there is one other circumſtance that I cannot help juſt in paſſing to take notice of, and it is that of a compulſory attendance enforced upon thoſe perſons who might have the misfortune to be deluded in a raſh unthinking moment, into a participation of their proceedings, to ſhame them from doing, as Mr. Paterſon, much to his honour did, return back to his duty. In this manner you will find, that no delegate is to leave
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:027594_0102_0FD54DCD6E106F48"/>
his poſt, or is to get permiſſion of abſence from it, till he obtains a new delegation, a ſubſtitute in his place to act for him; we ſaw too much of this I think pointed at to-day. Mr. Margarot ſaid, he would not touch upon the ſore heel of Paterſon, in the queſtion propoſed to the witneſs, which he refuſed to anſwer, and which the juſtice of the Court would not enforce for this highly favoured Pannel, who has been favoured more than any Scotchman would have been. He ſaid, he would not touch the ſore heel of Paterſon, for having done that which I am ſure you will join with me in thinking was to his honour; and God knows, when we look at thoſe we ſaw here this morning, what this Pannel will have to anſwer for; but I truſt what has been done this day will make them ſtudy the law and conſtitution of the country, before they give an opinion upon it, and before they truſt again to ſuch leaders as Mr. Margarot and Mr. Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. In one of the papers, Citizen Wilſon, and another, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted leave of abſence to be granted them; and it was moved that all the delegates ſhould have letters to return immediately, and remain at their poſts till the important buſineſs daily intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the Convention, ſhall be properly diſcuſſed; and in page 100 of the minutes, Citizen Scott moved, that before any delegate from the country ſhall leave his poſt, he ſhall write to his conſtituents to ſend another in his room. Agreed to, nem. con.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the two inſtances which I have given are perfectly ſufficient to ſhew, that in this reſpect alſo, as in their declaring themſelves permanent, which is proved by many witneſſes, and which is proved by the Gazetteer, that they, in every paper the moſt minute, imitate in every reſpect the proceedings of the French Convention. In one word, I leave this point for your conſideration; repeating again, that thoſe words taken of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or in any different circumſtances, would have themſelves been idle, and that which you could have grounded no verdict upon; but taking them in conjunction with the evidence of the Gazetteer, and the parole evidence this day upon your table, certainly do go to the point. Is it a ſeditious meeting or not, in as much as it is proved it was a meeting calculated for the purpoſe of overawing Parliament, and reſiſting any act which might paſs until compelled to deſiſt by ſuperior force; and that conduct followed by their adopting every form of that country to which I am ſo often alluding, if you are of that opinion, you will find a verdict in my favour, for with regard to his being a ringleader in this buſineſs and being a man who conducted theſe Committees the evidence upon that point is ſo clear, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in every word I have now read; the moment you have come to a determination upon the one point, it ſhews, that he is a principal in the guilt of being a Member of that Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a ringleader in it, as ſuch, he is more reſponſible than
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:027594_0103_0FD54DD013272708"/>
the poor creatures whom you have ſeen to day, and who were under his guidance.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I am afraid I treſpaſs more upon your time, much more than I had any intention of doing, when I roſe; but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help taking notice of one thing which dropped from the gentleman at the bar, in the commencement of this day's trial he told us, that he had cited ſeveral perſons, who were not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, this day upon the trial: men bearing the higheſt offices in the ſtate, and at preſent diſcharging the duties of thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant offices in England. And he brought evidence which I dare ſay is the caſe, that, under the letters of exculpation, which iſſue of courſe, and in which he can fill up any name that he pleaſes, that he ſubpoenaed them in London by the forms of the law of England; in the courſe of ſomething which was not a very proper argument upon the ſubject Mr. Margarot choſe to refer; and if I am not miſtaken, I thank him for the expreſſion; he referred to myſelf and to my own candour, if the public Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor had not higher powers in bringing witneſſes to this court than what he poſſeſſed. I have no difficulty, at all times and ſeaſons, to give my opinion to a Pannel, whether I am bound to do it or not, and I was ill-prepared then to give him an anſwer; but I ſaid I had no more power of compelling witneſſes to come into this court, than the meaneſt criminal at the bar. Our rights, in that reſpect, and our powers are the ſame. I will give him an inſtance of it: A noted inſtance occurred twelve years ago, when one of your Lordſhips filled the office of Solicitor General of Scotland. A man of the name of M'Gee, a carrier of letters, was brought under an accuſation of having embezzled letters and ſtolen money intruſted to his charge. The principal evidence was a woman, a relation of his own, and who, immediately after the fact was diſcovered, reitred to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. The Solicitor General brought his indictment againſt him. I at that time appeared as counſel for the pannel. The trial was adjourned from week to week, and from day to day; becauſe this material evidence, the woman, would not come, for obvious reaſons, within the juriſdiction of the courts of law, to give her teſtimony againſt the pannel. And now did ſhe at laſt come? Having been concerned with him, ſhe came at laſt becauſe means were round to notify to her, that if ſhe did not come to her duty as the witneſs againſt the pannel, ſhe herſelf would be tried in England, as an approver of the crime; and therefore ſhe came to ſave and redeem her own life, and gave evidence, as ſhe was bound to do; and which ſhe would have been compelled to do, if ſhe had been in this country; and I hope that inſtance will ſatisfy him, that even the powers of the public Proſecutor are juſt exactly what his are: that he muſt take his chance of bringing witneſſes from a foreign country, as we do; and if he is not ſucceſsful there is no help for it.</p>
               <p>But, gentlemen, if it is meant by ſaying that theſe men have
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:027594_0104_0FD7BFC36D24AFB8"/>
not obeyed the citation, if it is meant to found any plea of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour upon it, I leave the Pannel in full poſſeſſion of any benefit he may derive from it; but if you were to give weight to ſuch an objection as that, ſeeing the reaſon of it at preſent, there is not a pannel who would not be entitled to the ſame benefit, be his crime what it may, who will not tell you he has witneſſes in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, in France, in America, or in the Indies, and you muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways take the pannel's word for it; and you will conſider if there is any poſſibility of doing duty to yourſelves or your country, if you receive excuſes of that kind.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, before I ſit down, I muſt obſerve it was ſaid, that in all their pretenſions they were not afraid of what they were about. I omitted to mention one very material paper, which I truſt will ſatisfy you that the Gentlemen were perfectly aware of the danger of what they were about; in a letter from Mr. Hardy, who is the ſecretary of the London Correſponding Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, which was found in the poſſeſſion of Mr. Hardy, after a long account of what was going on, and telling him, that they had ſent draughts, and complaining of the ſhort coming in of the funds which were ſubſcribed, it ſeems, for the carrying Mr. Gerald down to this country; which, he ſays, had fallen la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentably ſhort of their expectations; and at laſt concludes thus: <q>I have to inform you of the wiſh of the Society, that you would favour them with the number of delegates in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention from England; alſo and how the civil and military power reliſhes your meeting.</q> Upon the 8th of November, 1793, a few days after Mr. Margarot and Mr. Gerald arrived in this city, upon an object which they are not aſhamed or afraid to avow, an object of the public good, and of Scotland in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, it is ſomething extraordinary that it ſhould come into the head of the ſecretary of the meeting, by which they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, to aſk the queſtion, how the civil and military power reliſhed their meeting. The military power has never inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered: it cannot interfere to check ſuch meetings as theſe though the conſequences of ſuch meetings, I hope and truſt, never will be ſuch as to render the civil power compelled to adopt that laſt and neceſſary meaſure; though, were I to look at the ſpeech of Mr. Gerald, ſtated in the Gazetteer, mentioned in the minutes, and which he gave immediately after that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn reſolution was come to, I will not at this hour trouble you with quoting it, it would be clear to demonſtration, that Mr. Gerald at that moment ſhews, in ſtrict terms, what is his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that this reſolution was come to, with the purpoſe of reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lawful authority by force, as Coborn tells you, paying no regard whatever to it, though paſſed by the Legiſlature; in that ſpeech referred to in the minutes, and in the Gazetteer, he ſays, I riſe to congratulate the Convention on the adoption of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, not only on the propriety of the meaſure itſelf, but on that unanimity and ſolemnity with which it is paſſed: then goes
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:027594_0105_0FD54DD2A0DCEB08"/>
on a long ſtory, with regard to the Iriſh bill. But the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is this, though I could not get a copy of this bill, the heads which I have read are ſufficiently explanatory of its deteſtable principles, which was a bill paſſed for the expreſs purpoſe of preventing the meeting of a Convention formed upon French models, and imitating French politics. I read the other day a ſpeech of one of the ableſt men in the Iriſh Parliament upon that ſubject. The object of that bill was to check a ſociety of united Iriſhmen; a ſociety alſo with whom I have the honour to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted; a ſociety which ſent ſome papers to this country of ſo ſeditious a nature, that even the firſt convention refuſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, as being a treaſonable paper, for which the unhappy mover is now ſuffering the puniſhment that the law has award<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He goes on: I hope the motion, which has paſſed this night, will convince the miniſter, that we are determined to guard againſt every attempt that may be made to deprive us of our rights; and, though by ſome it may be thought a bold, by others a daring meaſure; yet it will be found the beſt for ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the peace of the country: for if ſuch a law were ſuffered to paſs, if men were not allowed to utter their complaints, a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of rancorous paſſions would ariſe, and we ſhould ſeek to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to that laſt terrible deciſion, the event of which is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; but which God and nature allow. If the ſervility of the people had been leſs, if they had dared to meet, and in place of murmuring, had told the rulers, that there was danger in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to deprive them of their liberties, we need not have had that reſolution to have recurred to to-night; but when I ſaw the calm deliberate countenance of every one preſent, and the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn manner in which it was paſſed, I was convinced that it was not only a reſolution of words, but a rule of action. This is the commentary which Mr. Gerald gives to that reſolution, which I have already ſtated as being compoſed in artful ambiguous terms, and to which I have affixed ſo criminal and ſo guilty a concluſion. It appears to me, and I truſt will appear to you, that the purport of that reſolution ambiguouſly worded, and come to with ſuch awful ſolemnity, was a reſolution that, in any of thoſe emergencies, if they had happened, was not to be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of words, but a rule of action; you are to conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is to be ſuffered; and I know, becauſe it is the common law of the country, that your powers, as Jurymen, are ſufficient to check ſuch conventions. If ſuch men are to meet to conſider what are their rights, and what ought to entitle them to that laſt and terrible deciſion, the event of which is uncertain; but which God and nature allows. If you permit that to be allowed, where is the ſecurity of your laws, your lives, or your liberties? Where is the protection which this government gives to all, high or low, rich or poor, if theſe men's opinions, be they ever ſo learned, are to be ſet up in oppoſition to the Britiſh Parliament; or if they are to judge in what point they are to recur to that laſt
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:027594_0106_0FD7BFF42F7B8868"/>
and terrible deciſion, which comes to that which we ſee in a neighbouring country, where blood and devaſtation are the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain conſequences.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, before I conclude, ſomething was ſaid, and I hope I vindicated you; in the commencement of my argument; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was ſaid about the Juries of this country, ſomething was ſaid againſt myſelf and the other ſervants of the Crown. If he means the ſervants of the Crown in this country, I unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſtand amongſt them. It is ſaid that we are the perſons guilty of Sedition; that we ſowed ſedition between our maſter and our fellow ſubjects; and that we are the proper perſons to ſtand at that bar; that to us are to be imputed the offences with which I have charged him. Upon that point you muſt determine, and I feel not the leaſt difficulty in thinking that upon that charge I ſhall meet with a compleat acquittal: all that I now ſay, that ſtanding in the ſituation which I do, and ably aſſiſted as I am, I have never brought any indictment againſt any man for any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, I never opened in my life a bundle of papers which were laid before me, containing the caſe of a propoſed criminal, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an awful feeling upon my mind of the delicacy and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of that duty which depended upon the exerciſe of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and conſulting my conſcience upon the ſubject. If you differ with me upon this occaſion, I ſhould at leaſt hope, if it is poſſible we can differ upon the ſubject, that you will not think that I have brought any improper or oppreſſive proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before you; at leaſt, if I am guilty of ſeditiouſly perverting the duties of my office to any purpoſe, I ſhall look back with ſome conſolation that hitherto I have received the beſt ſupport, which comes home to a man's conſcience, the unanimous opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of a jury of my country. Something was ſaid of being a place-man and a penſioner. I am a place-man, it is true; I have been ten years in two high ſituations; and I have and am unqueſtionably liable to that unfaſhionable imputation of the Britiſh Convention; that even the boy they called exulted that he was not a penſioner. I plead guilty to the charge of being a place-man; as to a penſioner I am not, I ſhould feel myſelf mean indeed in my own eyes, if, by accepting the ſituation I now hold, my independence was injured in the ſmalleſt reſpect. I have been, by accidental circumſtances, early brought forward to thoſe ſituations, if I found them militating againſt the dictates of my own mind, I truſt, with all the emolument of it, nothing ſhould tempt me to retain it, or prevent me from throwing it up. I feel that I have done nothing but brought the guilty to juſtice; and as to what they may ſay, I care not for it. They have my full approbation: they have a better thing, they have a right to attack me upon that ſcore; as to a penſion I have none, nor am I liable to ſuch an imputation. I have, from the earlieſt period of my life, born in this place, from the moment I came to that bar, I have ſupported myſelf; and, were I to be turned out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow,
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:027594_0107_0FD7BFB52EB21A00"/>
I ſhould retire behind that bar, and my friends round me, as free of the public money, as poor and as independent a man as I was in 1784, when I was firſt introduced within in. I beg pardon for having deviated from that ſtrict line of my duty; but having been attacked, and probably ſhall again be attacked as a placeman and a penſioner, which is the cant phraſe of theſe gentlemen of the Britiſh Convention, I thought proper to ſay ſo much before I ſat down, and before I call upon you, which, I hope and truſt will be the caſe, to return that verdict which I think is founded upon the evidence, that this man is guilty of the crime of Sedition with which I have charged him.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Margarot.</speaker>
               <p> Gentlemen of the Jury,—I ſhall come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly with great diſadvantage, after the florid oratory of the public Proſecutor; however, he fortunately for me has been ſo very profuſe in many points, that it reminds me of Shakeſpear's proverb.</p>
               <q>"Two grains of wheat in a buſhel of chaff."</q>
               <p>I addreſs myſelf at preſent to my country, and through the medium of a Jury.—You are the repreſentatives of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;—great is the truſt repoſed in you, you are men, I make no doubt, of untainted,—of unſpotted characters, and I hope you will prove yourſelves ſuch.—High ſounding words I hope will yield to plain ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I am not an attorney, thank God;—neither am I a Member of Parliament,—thank God likewiſe.—It is the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Accuſer's buſineſs to ſet forth, in the moſt lively colours, every crime, or imputed crime, which he ſtates at the Bar of this Court.—I do not blame him for ſo doing. I do not find fault with him for making the moſt of his talents, or doing the moſt for the money he receives.—He has however tried to prejudice you in the firſt inſtance againſt me. He has thrown out that I have aſſerted you are a packed Jury.—It is a falſehood.—Forgive me, Gentlemen of the Jury,—forgive me, my country, if I ſpeak a bold but plain language.—I cannot give you (for I am not a ſycophant) high ſounding words, but that which you will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. I did not ſay you were a packed Jury—I objected to not one of you, but objected to the unconſtitutional way in which I ſaid the Jury were choſen out of the Aſſize; becauſe it is in the breaſt of Lord Juſtice Clerk to pick out ſuch as he thinks proper; and therefore though you are not a <hi>packed</hi> Jury, when he chuſes to exert his ſkill and penetration that way, you may become a <hi>picked</hi> Jury. However at preſent the cauſe is of great conſequence; it is not merely a criminal at the Bar that you ſee in me;—it is not the crimes of an individual; it is not the efforts of one ſingle perſon that are attacked;—no, it is at preſent your own rights which are attacked, as it is the rights of your country, and your country look to you to do thoſe rights juſtice, and to ſuſtain them.—Gentlemen, the public Proſecutor has found means to blend trials, crimes, criminals, various per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:027594_0108_0FD54DD7E48E2398"/>
and various articles of accuſation altogether, in order to make a ſum total of ſuch a ſize, as ſhall ſeize upon your imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and make you behold a mountain of guilt, where, in fact, there is not even a mole hill of imprudence—In me at preſent, I am ſorry for it, and it will appear perhaps a kind of pride; but it is the truth, that in me the cauſe of Parliamentary Reform is this day attacked—it is not the individual me—I ſhould have eſcaped notice; but it is the dangers impending from abroad, and the dangers impending at home, on the heads of thoſe who now occupy ſome of the higheſt ſtations in the ſtate;—of thoſe who, entruſted by the Crown with the greateſt powers, may perhaps have made a worſe uſe of them than they think they could anſwer for before a Parliament, fairly and freely choſen by the whole people of this country; and yet that very cauſe of Parliamentary Reform was eſpouſed by theſe very men before they were in place.—</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the public Proſecutor has ſaid, that I attempted, both in doors and out, to ſhake the confidence of the people, with regard to a Jury; and he afterwards with truth added, that a Jury was the brighteſt privilege of Engliſhman.—So it is, where a Jury is faithful to its truſt—it is the greateſt privilege the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Conſtitution knows of; becauſe, Gentlemen of the Jury, when you are honeſt, you ſtand not between the law and the accuſed, but between thoſe in power and the accuſed;—you ſee the due execution of the laws:—you ſtand between the accuſer and the man who is perhaps weaker than the accuſer, either in tongue or in knowledge; and as he has thought proper to avail himſelf of that ſuperority and to carry it ſorth, I will undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly yield to him in regard to talents and eloquence, but for the ſoundneſs of my doctrine I will not yield to him.—Gentlemen, I never attempted to prejudice the people againſt a Jury. I ever will lift up my voice againſt any act of iniquity, in impannelling a Jury,—againſt every act of iniquity, in trying to miſlead a Jury, or in trying to influence a Jury, even if the man on the Bench tries to influence a Jury, I ſhall try to ſtop him, I ſhall withhold him, and tell him, it is not his duty, though he ſits there as Judge, and I ſtand here as criminal, it is my right as a Briton, to keep him within the bounds of his duty, to keep him cloſe to the execution of the laws, if he attempts to depart from them in any one inſtance.—With the ſame ſpirit of inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the public Proſecutor has ſwelled out the treaſonable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which he ſays lies on the table; and he is obliged in the end, to tell you, that if it appears to you that the Britiſh Convention really had no ſeditious motives, if they were only, <hi>bona fide,</hi> ſeeking a Reform in Parliament, whether it was to be by annual Parliaments, or whether it was to be attended with unverſal ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage, or in whatever way it may take place, yet that Convention muſt be innocent; but ſays he, you muſt concur with me, that the parole and written evidence are more than ſufficient to prove me
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:027594_0109_0FD54DD968BFF608"/>
guilty; and adds a very curious reaſoning:—he ſays, if you wait till you have poſitive proof, it will be too late; therefore, make haſte, avail yourſelves of the preſumptive proof that I give you, and condemn him, which is to ſay, ſport with the lives,—ſport with the liberties of Engliſhmen, for fear of accidents befalling you hereafter.—Is that the language of mercy?—Is that the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Conſtitution?—Is it the language of the Laws?— He calls his proofs in the firſt inſtance ſolid and convincing; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, at laſt, he is obliged to have recourſe to that ſubterfuge: he ſays it amounts to more than ſedition, and arraigns the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Members of that Convention at the ſame time that he arraigns their wickedneſs, that they pretend to be ignorant of what really is ſedition; and yet he does not deign to inform them.—He ſays, it is as ſtrictly defined as murder, but he does not give you that definition; he only ſays, we are guilty of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.—Now ſedition muſt be ſome act; it cannot be a concealed operation of the mind, it muſt be an overt act: and yet he wants you to judge not of our overt acts, but of our intentions; which, all the witneſſes have agreed in ſaying, were peaceful, orderly, and ſeemingly legal. I ſay ſeemingly, becauſe, as there is that idea of our appearance being different from our real intention, I put the word ſeeming into their mouths; but I profeſs to you that our intentions perfectly coincided with our operations.— He acknowledges the right of the ſubject to addreſs the king or petition the Parliament; and it is well that he acknowledges it. —The affront upon your underſtandings; I repeat it, the affront upon your underſtandings would be too groſs, were he not to acknowledge that freemen have a right to petition for redreſs, when they think themſelves abuſed.</p>
               <p>You are not to judge (a curious reaſoning) Gentlemen you are not judge upon any particular fact;—you are not to judge merely upon the evidence brought againſt me;—you are not to judge upon thoſe trivial matters brought forth to night, which apply entirely to me; but you are to judge from the contexture of the whole. You are to judge from papers that are to crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Skirving, Brown, Sinclair, Callendar; and, as I underſtand there are a great number more againſt whom indictments are making out, theſe papers are to criminate all; and the contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is to criminate all. He has wandered far from the indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; he aſſerts of his authority, however, it is but juſt that, while he allows you the talent of prying into the hearts of men, it is but right, he ſhould retain ſome ſhare of the ſame penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore with that ſagacity which he claims, he ſays that our intentions were poſitively to join the invaders of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, let them be who they would, he does not name them, and then he deſires you, in a moſt pathetic manner, to lay your hands upon your hearts, and ſee if ſuch men ought not to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced traitors to their country. Undoubtedly men doing ſo would be traitors to their country; but how does he prove that
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:027594_0110_0FD54DDAE047EE68"/>
was our intention? He brings you forward far more convincing proof than writtten evidence; he brings you forward a blank to grove our guilt. He acknowledges that no notice has been taken of three prior Conventions; and yet it will appear to you, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, by thoſe who have attended theſe prior Conventions, that this Convention acted exactly upon the ſame plan; therefore the laws of the land were either aſleep at that time, or they are over vigilant at this. He calls us a ſet of French Conventioniſts. I do not believe there were five men in the Convention that can ſpeak French. I do not believe that there were five men who had an adequate idea of France; and it does not appear, from the evidence that has been brought before you, that any ſingle member of the Convention has any intercourſe whatever with France; but yet it is criminal in us to adopt certain terms. Thoſe terms, taken by themſelves, he tells you, are not criminal; but take them, at this preſent criſis, altogether, form a maſs of guilt which it really hurts him to mention, he is ſo tender. However, to ſupport this allegation, he does not bring any proof; he gives it merely as an aſſertion; and which is as legal an authority, as be undoubtedly held thoſe orders which he gave to Mr. David<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the Sheriff Subſtitute; and which, by the bye, he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges. He reflects upon me as being, or pretending to be, an Engliſhman. Dare he doubt it, or dare he diſpute it—I have been, I acknowledge it, obnoxious to his uncle or father, or whoever he is, in London and ſeveral other Members of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration. Thoſe who profit by the ſpoils of the nation, thoſe who once were friendly to a Reform in Parliament, but now they have got into the enjoyment of the good things of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, ſeek no more that reform. Had I been a foreigner I ſhould have been long ere now ſent abroad under the Alien Act.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, he alleges againſt me, as an article of accuſation, a motion ſaid to be made by me; and he then reverts to the teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of Roſs and Coburn, and ſupports it by other charges of certain forms which Mr. Callender (who, it ſeems, has run from his bail in a moſt diſgraceful manner) wiſhed to introduce into the Convention—A Reform of Parliament, he will not admit— he calls it (but it remains for the nation to determine, whether he calls it rightly or not) a change of the Conſtitution. A Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form undoubtedly would make a change, but it would not be in the Conſtitution; though, to be ſure, a change from ſickneſs to health is ſo far a change in the Conſtitution; but it is poſſible that you may recover your priſtine health, and make no altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in your former Conſtitution? you only do away your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; and that is the way in which a Reform is meant to operate. He pleads much againſt univerſal Suffrage, and annual Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Indeed annual parliaments he touches more tenderly upon. However, the ſame power that made them from annual to triennal, and from triennial to ſeptennial, may very likely go on to make them for life, or even hereditary.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="unknown:027594_0111_0FD7C05767A16A90"/>But to ſhew that univerſal Suffrage has taken place, I will give you a quotation from a Scotch Author. The Lord Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate has ſaid, it could not take place for the beſt of all poſſible reaſons, (and I have heard that twice in this Court) becauſe it is impracticable. A Lord, learned in the law, and whoſe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity none here will deny, Lord Kaims, ſays, that, <q>with regard to this matter one thing is certain, that the <hi>Regiam Majeſtatem</hi> was compiled in the days of one of our Davids. The author, whoever he be, declares that he was commanded by King David to compile this work with the counſel and advice of his whole realm.</q> There, Gentleman, you ſee it is not the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of repreſentatives; not the advice of individuals; but it was the advice of his whole realm. The ſame Lord Kaims does not fix a Government, or a Conſtitution to any one particular point. He does not tell you that the Conſtitution of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is the very beſt that ever exiſted from all eternity, as our learned Lord does; or that it will endure to all eternity, but he ſays, <q>Government is one of the arts which neceſſity has ſuggeſted, which time and experience have ripened, and which is ſuſceptible of improvements without end. It muſt alſo be the privilege of every Society to improve upon its go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</q>. There you ſee, Gentlemen, there you ſee, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this country, that it admits of improvements without end; and therefore that which is good to day may be better to-morrow. Lord Kaims ſays, <q>it is the privilege of every Society to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove upon its government;</q> and what ſignifies the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, if we are not to have the enjoyment of it. I will warrant the learned Lord, that whatever privileges he enjoys, in his ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, he would not think them privileges, if he was debarred from the enjoyment of them—Then, why ſhould a nation be deprived of that which would be a loſs to an individual, whoſe intereſt it is that the government ſhould be good. Is it the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the few, or the intereſt of the many?—Undoubtedly it is the intereſt of the many. It is the concern of the many, and conſequently the intereſt of the many. He continues,— <q>It muſt alſo be the privilege of every ſociety to improve upon its government, as well as its manufactures, huſbandry or other art invented for their good</q>—Here you ſee if an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement is admiſſible in an art, it is ſo in government. <q>No particular form therefore can be eſſential, as no particular form is preferable to another.</q> This is a Scotch Lord who ſpeaks, <q>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by having a greater tendency to promote its end—the good of the ſociety.</q> Therefore, how excellent ſoever our Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be in its preſent form of three eſtates, and in the preſent moſt excellent moſt immaculate ways of electing Members of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament; yet, if there is a better mode of electing Members of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, it is not only our right, but our duty to do it; yet meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for that purpoſe are deemed ſeditious, although there is
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:027594_0112_0FD54DDEA0DA6680"/>
no overt act of Sedition, but merely the conſtruction of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Accuſer, for the doctrine that he has pleaded is, that before a man is guilty you ſhall hang him, that he may not become a rogue.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, another great point is the committee of ſecrecy; that galls him ſorely. Undoubtedly we ought to have told him what we were about. We ſaid we had no ſecrets, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after appointed a committee of ſecrecy. It is true, and there is no inconſiſtency in it. We had no ſecrets to go upon; our plan was perfectly conſtitutional, and muſt operate for the common good; but, at the ſame time, feeling ourſelves under the arm of power; feeling ourſelves to be militating againſt abuſe all powerful, it was prudent in us for the preſent not to expoſe ourſelves more than neceſſary: it was prudent to ſecure to ourſelves a ſafe place of meeting. He has ſaid, it would be rebellion, and an overt act of treaſon. As to that I do not ſee how a ſecret meeting can be an overt act of treaſon. We ſhould have been able to repair to the place of meeting ſecretly, becauſe we knew every ſtretch of power would be made uſe of againſt us, and there is more reaſon to ſuſpect that the preſent war with France is not directed ſolely againſt France, but againſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form in England. It was meant by that war to divert the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the public from that cauſe, under the pretext of that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient prejudice, that that country was always our natural enemy; the numerous failures that are daily taking place; the numerous loſſes that we have experienced, both, I am ſorry to ſay it, both by ſea and land, teach us that that war is far from being a profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table one; teach us, that we are farther off gaining our end now, than we were at the beginning of that war; for we are at this day leſs able to treat, or to treat on ſuch advantageous terms with that nation we have ſo much deſpiſed as we were at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the war. Ruin ſtares us in the face in every part of the kingdom; every manufacturing town is labouring under the greateſt miſery. London ſhews no leſs than 8000 Spitalfields manufacturers who are ſtarving. Norwich, another great trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing town (from which I have appeared in the Convention as a Delegate) is in ſo diſmal a ſituation, that the poor rates, which were at firſt, two years ago I think, or 18 months ago, but 3<abbr>s.</abbr> 6<abbr>d.</abbr> in the pound, now amount to the enormous ſum of 17<abbr>s.</abbr> 6<abbr>d.</abbr>; and, by Lady-day next, they will be 20<abbr>s.</abbr> in the pound, owing to the preſent war.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I hope you will not think it impertinent in me to follow the example that has been ſet me, of reading from a newſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paper. It is not altogether ſo pleaſing a fact to me, as that which the Proſecutor ſtated from the Gazetteer was to him. It gave him ſatisfaction that it criminated me—it gives me pain that I am obliged to criminate thoſe that are in office. I will read to you a letter from a clergyman who viſited the Spitalfields' weav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and made a report of that viſit. You will by this ſee part of
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:027594_0113_0FD7BFC844A83AF0"/>
the diſtreſs in which they are now plunged, owing to the war: it is a letter addreſſed to the Reverend mr: T—. <stage>(<hi>Reads it from the Morning Chronicle.</hi> See Appendix, No. 1.)</stage>
               </p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I will alſo read you a paragraph uncontradicted by authority, from the Morning Chronicle, of 1ſt January, 1793. The Editor ſays,—"In one ſhort month (December 1792)"— (<hi>See Appendix, No.</hi> 2.)</p>
               <p>What is that but ſaying that our conſtitution is greatly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired within theſe twelve months, if we do not look to it, we ſhall have nothing but an Italian or a Spaniſh conſtitution left to us. How therefore are we to reſtore that conſtitution but by a timely reform! and how are we to obtain that reform, but by purſuing it with vigour? and how are we to purſue it, if we are not to meet, and if an Engliſh Jury will permit to public proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor (and believe every word he ſays) to throw an odium upon them; and ſay, that though their meaning may be good now, it may in future be bad; and therefore you muſt condemn them as ſeditious. As a further proof, however, of the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onality of theſe meetings, and the right we have to revert to our original conſtitution, and to do away the exiſting defects of that which is termed the preſent conſtitution; I will read to you a letter from Lord Bathurſt to Dean Swift; although in his time the houſe of Commons was corrupt; ſince that time no great effort has been made to amend it; and we all know that human inſtitutions, however good they may be in their firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out, go naturally to decay, unleſs repaired. It has more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over been aſſerted, that one of the glories of our conſtitution is, that it is of ſuch a nature, that it will admit of repair without being thrown out of order, and will always be advantaged by it; and that repair muſt come from the people; but hear what Lord Bathurſt ſays: <q>I am convinced that our conſtitution is already gone:" luckily for the public proſecutor he has found it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, "and we are idly ſtruggling to maintain what in truth has been long loſt; like ſome old fools here, with gout and palſies, at fourſcore years old drinking the waters," he was then at Bath, "in hopes of health again. If this was not our caſe, and that the people are already in effect ſlaves, would it have been poſſible for the miniſter, who projected the exciſe ſcheme (before the heats which it had occaſioned in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were well laid) to have choſen a new parliament again exactly to his mind? and though perhaps not altogether ſo ſtrong in numbers, yet as well diſpoſed in general to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes as he could wiſh. His maſter, I doubt, is not ſo well beloved as I could wiſh he was.</q> You ſee that even in the time of Lord Bathurſt there were no greater enemies to the King than bad ſervants; for none alienate the affections of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from a King ſo much as bad ſervants of the Crown.—<q>His maſter, I doubt, is not ſo well beloved as I could wiſh he was: the miniſter, I am ſure, is as much hated and deteſted as ever
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:027594_0114_0FD54DE2B2ACDEB0"/>
man was;</q> whether that applies to the preſent time or not, I leave the people of England and Scotland to diſcover, <q>and yet I ſay a new parliament was choſen of the ſtamp that was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, after having failed in the moſt odious ſcheme that ever was projected. After this, what hopes can there poſſibly be of ſucceſs? Unleſs it be from confuſion, which God forbid I ſhould live to ſee. In ſhort, the whole nation is ſo abandoned and corrupt, that the Crown can never fail of a majority in both houſes of parliament. He makes them all in one houſe, and he chooſes above half in the other, four and twenty bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops," very upright men, "and ſixteen Scotch Lords is a terrible weight in one; forty-five from one country, beſides all the Weſt of England, and all the government boroughs, is a dreadful number in the other. Were his majeſty inclined to-morrow to declare his body coachman his firſt miniſter, it would do juſt as well, and the wheels of government would move as eaſily as they do with the ſagacious driver, who now ſits on the box. Parts and abilities are not in the leaſt want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to conduct affairs: the coachman knows how to feed his cattle, and the other feeds the beaſts in his ſervice; and this is all the ſkill that is neceſſary in either caſe. Are not theſe ſufficient difficulties and diſcouragements, if there were no others, and would any man ſtruggle againſt corruption, when he knows that if he is ever near defeating it, thoſe who make uſe of it only double the doſe, and carry all their points fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and with a higher hand than perhaps they at firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</q> Therefore the poor Reformer generally comes off the worſt; as perhaps will be the caſe with thoſe now at your bar. Gentlemen, ſince the days of Lord Bathurſt the diſorders of the ſtate have gone on encreaſing, and we are now loaded with ſuch an immenſe debt, that it is incomprehenſible how the nation ſupports itſelf under it; and there are now forty millions more to add to it, for the ſake of preventing a reform in parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. A foreign war was entered into with that view, while the Crown Lawyers have been buſy at home: words have been raked up of as far date back as a twelve month; ſpies ſet in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate families; ſervants interrogated; the man has been ſet againſt his maſter, and the child againſt its parent. Every art has been uſed to bring forth criminal proſecutions, in order that reform may be diſcouraged in every ſhape; and that thoſe, who had been the foremoſt in attempting any thing like reform, ſhould be ſtigmatiſed as ſeditious,—treaſonable,—as ring leaders. —Theſe words you have vociferated again and again, until they muſt have tired your patience.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, here is a ſtatement of the national debt, which perfectly applies to the caſe in point. The national debt began with our happy revolution, which we are all bound to praiſe; and would to God the conſtitution was as ſound now as it was then. The national debt was a ſcheme deviſed by William and

Mary, to ſecure their footing in England. At firſt it amounted, I believe, to ſeven millions; but during that reign it increaſed to ſixteen millions, and the wars of Queen Anne increaſed it to fifty-four millions—the amount of the debt at the end of the war of 1748 was 78,250,000<abbr>l.</abbr>; the amount of the debt at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the war in 1775 was ſeventy-five millions; after that there was a diminution took place of about four millions, which were paid off. At the end of Lord Chatham's war, the national debt amounted to one hundred and forty-ſix millions; it diminiſhed by the peace to one hundred and thirty-ſix millions, ſo that a peace which laſted till 1775 diminiſhed it ten millions, and in the war from 1775 to 1783, the infamous American war, where you will recollect the Americans were firſt treated as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, exactly in the ſame manner that the French are now treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; they were deemed rebels; they were deemed a ſet of vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains; they were deemed the worſt creatures upon the face of the earth; and whenever they were ſpoken of, it was one Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock, one Adams, one this, one that, and one the other, till we found, at the end of ten years war, and an expence of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty-four millions, beſides one hundred thouſand lives loſt in the war: we were obliged to give up the war, and accept of an Ambaſſador from them: and, at the time of Mr. Pitt's acceſſion to the treaſury bench it amounted to two hundred and ſeventy millions. At this preſent day it is upwards of three hundred millions; and if we go on thus, year after year, we ſhall ſoon make it four hundred millions. But the remarks in this paper are more appoſite.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>So immenſe a debt as two hundred and ſeventy millions, bearing an intereſt of about nine millions and a half, was an alarming circumſtance to the public, after the loſs of half the Britiſh dominions abroad; and ſomething muſt be done to divert the attention of the people from any ſerious enquiry into the corruption and abuſes which had involved the nation in ſuch ruin.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Mr. Fox was for probing this ulcerated wound to the bottom, and meting our ſituation in an open and manly manner, but the <hi>ſecret junto</hi> in the Cabinet,</q>—and that junto, Gentlemen of the Jury, I will tell you originated in Scotland. I know not at preſent whether it continues its root there or not; I am much inclined to think it does; but the ſecret junto—<q>foreſaw, that ſuch a meaſure would lead to impeachments, refunding and confiſcation of property. He was therefore turned out of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and Mr. Pitt ſeduced from his friends and party to become the tool of thoſe who began to be alarmed for fear an inveſtigation ſhould take place.</q> Here then Mr. Pitt is only the oſtenſible miniſter, while in fact he is ruled by a ſecret junto. <q>A bubble was invented to amuſe the people, and ſtop the mouths of the monied men, the weakeſt that ever was formed, and the moſt ruinous and wicked one
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:027594_0116_0FD54DE565647E98"/>
that ever ſucceeded. The underſtrappers in office,</q> in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, gentlemen, we have underſtrappers in office as well as in Scotland, <q>and treaſury runners, were inceſſantly employed in blacking Mr. Fox, and circulating in every company, that Mr. Pitt was to pay off the National Debt. The meaſures he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted for that purpoſe were cried up as a maſter piece of wiſdom: and this was again rung in the ears of the credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous people in every corner of the kingdom by the proſtituted prints in the Miniſter's pay. By ſuch means, this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary-bubble was blown up to an enormous ſize, and the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in Holland and France, as long as we kept in peace with the laſt mentioned nation, were favourable to theſe meaſures. The prodigious demand for our manufactures, the increaſe of trade.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I was in France, gentlemen, between three and four years ago upon a mercantile expedition. I had an opportunity of viewing all the great warehouſes in France, from the northernmoſt extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to that very ſouthernmoſt point of Toulon, which we have lately abandoned; and I will tell you, that in one ſmall town not ſo large as Leith, there was at that time Engliſh goods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoke, and in a great meaſure paid for, to the amount of three millions ſterling; that kept our manufactures afloat, that gave proſperity to the Nation, and that was in conſequence of the commercial Treaty which was entered into between the two countries about five years back, and in which I am not aſhamed to ſay that I lent my humble aſſiſtance, not officially to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter here, but unofficially to the Miniſter in France, becauſe I knew the commercial connection of two nations was the way to enrich both, and becauſe I knew that to do away that idea, that they were natural enemies, and ſhould go to war upon every trivial occaſion, was the only way to keep us in peace and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ſhedding of blood, which I am always ſorry for in any caſe whatever. I wiſh I could ſay ſo of our Governors, <q>the influx of money from France, Holland, and the convulſed parts of Europe, gave Miniſters an opportunity of levying enormous new taxes, even in time of peace,</q> while we were pretending to pay off the National Debt, every year brought us new taxes; why? becauſe a majority in the Houſe of Commons was to be ſecured. <q>Mr. Pitt took every advantage that all thoſe favourable opportunities gave him, and loaded the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with ſuch heavy, partial, and grievous taxes, as no Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ever before attempted, even in times of war.</q> I doubt not, people of Scotland, but you labour under grievous taxes, as well as we in England; there is one I will give you an idea of, the Salt Tax, which ſlies in the face of common ſenſe; but it is kept up for a reaſon which I will tell you by and bye; the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection annually amounts from 19 to 20,000<abbr>l.</abbr> but the expence of collecting it amounts to 30,000<abbr>l.</abbr> People who are unthinking may ſay, why does not the Miniſter ſell it when he loſes ſo much
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:027594_0117_0FD7C05B4762CEE0"/>
by it; it gives the Miniſtry at the trifling expence of 11,000<abbr>l.</abbr> 
                  <hi>per annum,</hi> it gives them a patronage of 30,000<abbr>l.</abbr> 
                  <q>Mr. Pitt's Shop Tax, Fuſtian Tax, his Tax on the Poor Servant Maids, the extenſion of Exciſe Laws, his Commutation Tax, and others equally obnoxious, are witneſſes of the truth of what I now advance; with all his low cunning, artifice, exertions, ſpies, informers.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the Convention is reproached with adopting French words and French manners; it is now about ſix years ago that the Commercial Treaty was, I muſt not ſay on the <hi>tapis,</hi> but was pending in the caſe I mentioned before, in which my humble efforts were uſed; I had acceſs to ſome of the dependents of the French Miniſtry, and I there found that in Pitt's cabinet there was a ſyſtem of Police; I made uſe of that word, which is adopted in Ireland, in a great meaſure in London, and very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will be ſoon introduced into Scotland, if not already; the French Police, Pitt applied to Bretagne, and from them obtained every article of the French Police, Spies, and Informers and every thing except the Baſtile; they had but one, and they could not ſpare that one: however we have made ſhift without it, having converted Newgate, and the Counter, and other priſons to that purpoſe, until a proper one ſhall be built; there is one building in the neighbourhood of London, and I think I have ſeen ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like one building in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh; he has imported Spies and Informers, who have exerted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and every one of them has been well paid for it; Spies and Informers, French things as well as French words. And I believe the Nation, at that time, though much degenerated, I have reaſon to believe, that at the firſt outſet of Spies and Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, the Police of England were at a loſs to find Engliſhmen willing to undertake thoſe odious taſks; ſorry I am to ſay, that that repugnance is now nearly done away, that there is not a public company without a Spy in it, and even the ſervants of the Crown glory in their having Spies; ſome are more diligent than others; I ſaw one here to-night, who, though he keeps ſix Spies daily, it is no uncommon thing for them to regret, at the end of the week, that they have brought him no intelligence; backed with the moſt extenſive commerce ever known, our manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and internal trade, puſhed by induſtry, private credit, and paper currency, to a pitch never before heard of; and, in ſhort, the whole credit of the merchants, traders, and manufacturers, exerted to the utmoſt, to keep every hand uſefully employed, was not ſufficient to raiſe taxes to pay the intereſt of ſo immenſe a ſum as two hundred and ſeventy Millions of National Debt, defray the expences of Government, which, together with the intereſt, amounted to the enormous ſum of about ſeventeen Millions in time of Peace, without reckoning the Millions to be annually provided to ſupport this bubble; all this, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the flouriſhing ſtate which peace and the unexampled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:027594_0118_0FD54DE991A12B18"/>
of the people to revive our trade and commerce, could not be annually drawn from their labours, nor raiſed by any of the oppreſſive means adopted, without borrowing new loans; on one hand, as ſtock was purchaſed with the public money, on the other, that is to ſay, in paying the National Debt, you took the money out of one pocket, and paid it into the other; but while you did that, ſome of it always fell to the ground, which you never will ſee again: that money is employed in keeping up the price of Stocks; ſome thouſands go weekly that way; a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form in Parliament would do away that abuſe. <q>The Bank, that ſacred, public, and private repoſitory for wealth, was ſqueezed out of half a Million. This drew on them creditors for the unclaimed dividends to a much larger amount, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means, equally unjuſt, were purſued to ſupply the defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency. But all this would not do; the bubble muſt ſooner or later burſt, and with a dreadful exploſion, unleſs ſpeedily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by a more ſkilful financier than Mr. Pitt.</q> This bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble does not only threaten this Empire with the moſt terrible convulſions, but to ſpread miſchief into other countries. We have been told, that the Bank of Amſterdam is intimately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with our own; if that fails, ours will, and that was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as the reaſon for our going to war; and very likely our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to war, will be a reaſon for our Bank failing: <q>it is form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on ſuch ruinous principles, that it is impoſſible all the ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and induſtry of a brave, hardy, and loyal people, when ſtrained to the utmoſt pitch, can ſupport it; it was ſetting the Public to roll a heavy ſtone up a ſteep mountain, which grows ſteeper and ſteeper as the ſummit is approached. To attempt to pay off the National Debt by purchaſing Stock, is one of the moſt barefaced robberies.</q> Here is language! this in Edinburgh would be Sedition; it would go near to be Treaſon —<q>the attempt to pay off the National Debt by purchaſing up Stock, is one of the moſt barefaced robberies committed on the People, that ever was attempted in any civilized nation.</q> Here you ſee Mr. Pitt is called a robber, and the moſt barefaced and impudent robber that ever was, <q>loading the People with unbearable Taxes, to enrich who? the Stockholders, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied-men, and Gamblers, in the Alley; theſe were ſure to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the miniſterial runners in blowing up this bubble, which brought ſo much griſt to their mill; by their united arts and unwearied efforts, they actually raiſed the price of Stock to ſuch a pitch, as to make the Public pay more than 20<abbr>l.</abbr> ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling more than the intrinſic value, upon every 100<abbr>l.</abbr>
                  </q> And as long as the induſtry of the People could bear ſuch burdens as were heaped upon them, there is every reaſon to believe they would riſe higher and higher; ſo that the more the Public pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed, the more they would have to pay for the remainder, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding this bubble was ſuffered to continue. Mr. Pitt, inſtead of paying off any part of the National Debt, in time of peace,
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:027594_0119_0FDC053F063CE0C8"/>
by his plan, had added many Millions; and if we are to go on in this ruinous plan, the increaſed price of the ſtock will lead us with more than 150 Millions more than was ever owed or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have been borrowed.</p>
               <p>There, Gentlemen, in conſequence of this ſyſtem, the Nation will find itſelf debtor 150 Millions more than ever was pretended had been lent to it; an immenſe ſum of itſelf, but which the Nation would have been barefacedly robbed of—150 Million ſterling which we never borrowed. <q>It will eaſily be ſeen, by examining the Hiſtory of the Revenue, or this brief ſtatement, that every war which this Country has been engaged in has nearly doubled the former Debt and Taxes, let them amount to what they might; and yet the Nation has been plunged into a war, with this heavy millſtone of two hundred and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty Millions about its neck. The effect of this raſh mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure has been ſuddenly and ſeverely felt; almoſt a total ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in trade and commerce, the Revenue decreaſing in the moſt alarming manner, all private credit deſtroyed:</q> the neighbourhood of Edinburgh will witneſs that: look at Paiſley, look at Glaſgow, and their Banks, even which will all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you that there is truth in this aſſertion; <q>no one dare truſt his neighbour, bankruptcies innumerable, the induſtrious poor thrown out of employment.</q> Do we not ſee that even in Edinburgh, the poor are ready and willing to work if they could get it? Are they not the ſame at Paiſley? are they not the ſame at Glaſgow? I have already inſtanced to you in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; Norwich, Sheffield, and Mancheſter, where the poor are out of number; but here is an addition, <q>proviſions, and even hay, ſent out of the kingdom, to ſupply the German armies,</q> not to ſupply our own troops, but forſooth, we muſt take other troops into pay, while our poor are ſtarving at home in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it, <q>which keeps up the price of meat to a height never remembered at this ſeaſon of the year; coals, candles, ſoap, ſugar, and many other articles in common uſe, are raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or kept up, in conſequence of the war.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here is an article to which I would turn your attention, the article of coals, the City of London yearly, conſumes about forty-thouſand chaldron of coals; every chaldron of coals pays one ſhilling, to whom? To a man who did not think pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, when cited by the laws of his Country, to appear before you; and pays it to him, why? Becauſe he is the deſcendant of a natural ſon of Charles II. If he had been a poor man, and it had been neceſſary to keep up an appearance of reſpectability in his ſtation; there would have been ſome excuſe; but he has another ſinecure which amounts to more than he ſpends; this is one of the abuſes of a corrupt Parliament.—Our money ſhipped off to pay the troops, and ſupply the beggarly German Princes on the Continent. The parochial taxes prodigiouſly increaſed, by the numerous poor thrown out of employment; or borne
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:027594_0120_0FD54DEC26D7D130"/>
down by the heavy load of taxes Mr. Pitt has thrown upon them; and threatened, notwithſtanding all that is ſaid to the contrary, with the ruin of another American war. In ſuch a ſtate, is it poſſible to expect that the public can bear to double the preſent National Debt and Taxes, without burſting Mr. Pitt's bubble, formed for plundering the poor to add to the rich. This man ſpeaks very plain Engliſh, and I am ſorry to ſay, he ſpeaks as truly, as he does plainly; it has been a decided plan with thoſe in power, to plunder the poor to give to the rich; and will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo, while uſeleſs places, while uſeleſs penſions, are ſuffered to exiſt, while a Lord Juſtice General of Scotland, who never attends his place, though juſtice is the moſt ſacred duty a man can acquit himſelf of; the duty of a Judge is the moſt ſacred duty that a man can undertake, ſince it is the repreſentive of God himſelf: that he ſhould accept of 2000<abbr>l.</abbr> a year and never attend in his place, to diſtribute that juſtice for which he is ſo amply paid; that is another proof of ſinecure places, and a proof that we want a Reform in Parliament; you have now been a hundred years, except one inſtance, without the appearance of a Lord Juſtice General; 200,000<abbr>l.</abbr> therefore has been carried out of Scotland and ſpent in England; therefore you annually loſe 2000<abbr>l,</abbr> for which you derive no advantage whatever. <q>The criſis draws near, when every inferior conſideration muſt give way for public good, and Mr. Fox's open and manly abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities muſt be called forth, to form an honeſt, juſt, permanent, and upright Miniſtry, to ſave the King and People from one common ruin.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I did not read this to you, Gentlemen, with a view to trumpet up Mr. Fox: no man can have a greater reſpect for his abilities than I have, but I am far from thinking that no man in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom can ſave us but him; I would not make any man a God; let us not truſt them; let us not give them implicit faith; let us truſt to none of our rulers; let us truſt only to our Laws; and while we give implicit faith to them, and ſee that our rulers act according to thoſe laws, we ſhall be happy: the moment we do otherwiſe, we ſhall be ſlaves. <q>Apoſtates have raiſed falſe alarms of treaſon, ſedition, rebellion, and every thing that can rouſe up a generous People, to revenge the inſults and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries heaped upon them; but the People are loyal, love their King, reſpect mild laws, and bear an utter hatred to all who attempt to impoſe upon them, by apoſtacy, fraud, or treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, and are ſworn enemies to all ſorts of perſecutions.</q> Would not you think that the writer of this letter had ſome of the perſecutions which have lately taken place, in his eye? You will ſee then, Gentlemen, that it is not merely in Scotland alone —that the People in Scotland are not the only People who ſee their true intereſts; that the People of England, likewiſe, begin to diſcern that they are impoſed upon, that thoſe who are in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice deceive them: open your eyes, therefore, Gentlemen, and
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:027594_0121_0FD54DEE81F290D0"/>
be not deceived; let not the words of office, let not the high ſounding language of a Crown Lawyer trepan you into a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, for if you ſuffer yourſelves to be deceived, though not a wilful perjury, it ſtill remains a perjury, unleſs you give a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict according to the dictates of your own conſcience; and the dictates of that conſcience cannot take place, till you have made a fair and candid examination of the matter before you.</p>
               <p>His poſtcript ſays, <q>Two hundred and ſeventy Million is a ſum the human mind can hardly form an idea of: to give ſome aſſiſtance in forming a notion of it, were it to be laid down in guineas in a line, it would extend 4300 miles: if in ſhillings, it would extend three and a half times round the globe; and if paid in ſolid ſilver, would require more than 60,000 horſes to draw it, at the rate of 1,500 weight to a horſe;</q> and yet the good people of this country are, by their labours, to pay off the intereſt of this debt, and are with the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of Pitt's calculations, to pay off the capital alſo. The number of inhabitants of Great Britain has been miſtated, as well as many other things, by the public proſecutor; he has ſtated them to be ten millions; they perhaps, do not go much beyond ſeven millions; but we will ſay eight millions, and among them you cannot ſay there are more than two million of men: and, therefore two million of people are to pay the intereſt of this debt, which, if laid out in guineas, in a line, would extend upwards of 4,300 miles. Good God! when ſhall we get to end of ſuch a journey; and yet we are daily encreaſing in it by a war; and, what is the conſequence of that war? not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences abroad, but it encreaſes ſalaries and penſions: we bought: Toulon with gold; we left it for nothing: it is true, we adopted again the French meaſures; we named Commiſſioners: one Commiſſioner ſet out, with a ſervice of plate, to do honour to the name of an Engliſhman, which coſt 8,000<abbr>l.</abbr> and yet there are 8000 Spitalfields weavers in a ſtate, of actual ſtarvation; and yet, to one man, is preſented a ſervice of plate, of that immenſe value, previous to his going as Commiſſioner to Toulon: he comes back again, and is now out of office, but has retired upon half pay: this is the way the public money is ſquandered; this is the way the public money will be ſquandered till we obtain a Reform in Parliament; therefore, no man, not the public pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor himſelf, can love the Conſtitution better than I do; but no man can deteſt the abuſes that are engrafted on that conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more than I do; for, I have ſeen ſo much miſery, in the courſe of my tours through Great Britain, which is the garden of Europe, where there is not a man, who would exert his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, but might earn a comfortable livelihood, if our Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was returned to that point at which it was ſettled at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution; but it is all done away; I will give you proof that it is done away; and I have taken care to give you that proof, or, at leaſt that each of you may be furniſhed with a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

you retire to debate upon the matter that is brought before you: it is in a ſpeech of Mr. Wharton's, in the Houſe of Commons: I will read it to you; and I am ſorry, that the public proſecutor has retired; I would have attacked him perſonally; he was a Member of the Senate; and, I believe, he was there at the time he bore, he ſuffered this worthy man, an honeſt Member in the preſent Britiſh Houſe of Commons; he ſuffered him to aſſert, that every part of our Conſtitution was done away; he did not riſe to contradict him; though here vociferous to the utmoſt, there he was ſilent; I am ſeditious in ſeeking a Reform; but, when a man tells them, every iota of the Conſtitution is done away, the whole he could do, was to vote ſilently againſt him; and the motion was loſt, becauſe the majority did not think pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to ſtake their future fortune, reputation, or property, upon the reviſal of the Conſtitution. May a friend be permitted to read it for me?</p>

               <p> Gentlemen, you are entruſted now by your country, to give a verdict, to examine ſeriouſly the cauſe that is now before you. I have already told you, I am a willing and a devoted victim; I will give you a proof of it; and you ſhall have that proof home with you, in a letter, that I wrote to Dundas, a twelvemonth ago, when proſecutions were hanging over the heads of the people: I offered myſelf for proſecution; I deſired him to ſpare them, and let his vengeance fall upon me: I eſcaped it in London; I hope I ſhall not find it in Scotland; I hope the honeſty of any Jury will prevent its having the effect it was meant to have. This is the ſpeech of Mr. Wharton, in the Houſe of Commons. Mr. Wharton roſe to make his propoſed motion. "We heard," he ſaid, <q>on every ſide, of the glorious Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, in 1668, and of the Conſtitution, as ſettled at the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Revolution; it was a note which he had always liſtened to with pleaſure, and he repeated it himſelf with rapture. But, what was the rational foundation of our ſatisfaction, at the recollection of the glorious Revolution? It aſſuredly was not that the poſſeſſion of the throne, and the regular hereditary ſucceſſion to it, were, at that time diſturbed and interrupted. It was not that we expelled <hi>one</hi> king, and <hi>one</hi> family, and appointed <hi>another</hi> king, and <hi>another</hi> family, in their room. The neceſſity of ſuch changes was, at all times, to be <hi>deplored;</hi> and, the events, themſelves, could only be juſtified by the <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.</hi> The only rational foundation of our approbation of that Revolution, <hi>muſt</hi> be, at that time, ſuch principles were confirmed, and ſuch wiſe and wholeſome proviſions made for our conſtitutional ſecurity and happineſs, as might prevent all future neceſſity for a <hi>ſimilar</hi> Revolution. Whoever approved of that Revolution, declared, at the ſame time, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional proviſions then obtained, were wiſe and wholeſome proviſions; that they were <hi>worthy</hi> objects of a national ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle;
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:027594_0123_0FD54DF2269E3718"/>
that they not only <hi>juſtified</hi> reſiſtance, but made it <hi>merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</hi>
                  </q> And yet, this is one of the articles of crimination a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me. Gentlemen, it is ſaid that the Convention meant to aſſert their rights: now, aſſertion may be made in various ways; it may be made, <hi>vi et armis;</hi> it may be made by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; by reaſon; and, there is no direct proof, that we meant to aſſert them by force of arms; and, from our paucity, it is moſt likely we ſhould do it by argument. He ſays, <q>they not only juſtified reſiſtance, but made it meritorious; and that they were <hi>cheaply</hi> purchaſed, at the price of all the blood that was ſhed upon the occaſion, as well as the dethronement of a <hi>guilty</hi> king, and the extirpation of his <hi>guiltleſs</hi> family. But an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of that Revolution went ſtill farther. It declared, that if, by <hi>any</hi> means, by force, or by fraud, by violence, or by corruption.</q> Jurymen, I requeſt your utmoſt attention to this; it is of the greateſt conſequence. <q>But an approbation of that Revolution (1688), went ſtill farther. It declared, that if, by <hi>any</hi> means, by force, or by fraud, by violence, or by corruption, if theſe wholeſome and neceſſary conſtitutional proviſions ſhould, by any means, be taken away, or fruſtrated, the ſame objects would again juſtify the ſame national ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle; and, the ſame extremities, unleſs they could be recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, and, re-obtained by more gentle, more peaceful, and, therefore, more happy means.</q> We at preſent feel, that force or fraud violence and corruption, have taken away many of our privileges: we wiſh to regain them; not by force, but by thoſe more peaceful, and, therefore, more happy means, which is a peaceable and rational application to the King, or to the Parliament, by an aſſertion of our rights, made in ſuch a reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table manner, that they ſhall not be refuſed; for, it is idle to talk of the omnipotence of Parliament; the ſervant can never be greater than its maſter; the three Eſtates together, are not equal in value to the whole nation: without them, the nation could be a nation; but, without the nation they would become poor indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals. He aſſerted (and ſaid he riſked nothing by the aſſertion, <q>for no man could be hardy enough to deny it, and, he pledged himſelf to <hi>prove</hi> it in a Committee of the Houſe), that all that was valuable to the people of this country, all the proviſions which were ſtipulated to ſecure the peace and proſperity, the individual liberty, and the general property of the people of this land, had, all been, ſince the Revolution, taken away— All!</q>

               <p>He aſſerts, in the Houſe of Commons, and pledges himſelf to prove, that all the ſecurity of the ſubject, all the privileges of the ſubject, in the Conſtitution, which is trumpeted up by venal hirelings, has been taken away, and he pledges himſelf to prove all this; and, to this, not a ſingle man riſes to give an anſwer. <q>He muſt entreat the attention of the Houſe, for a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whilſt he very briefly brought back to their recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:027594_0124_0FD54DF3AC43C1B0"/>
what this country eſtabliſhed by the Revolution. Firſt, To avoid all future miſtakes; and, that the contract between Prince and People might be clearly underſtood, the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioniſts began by altering the oaths of the contracting parties.</q> Here again I will interrupt myſelf, to ſhew you that the King holds his Crown, not by a divine right, but by a contract between him and the people, which implies a mutual binding; and, ſhould either of the contracting parties fail, it will become void: Men in buſineſs, you muſt know it; and, from buſineſs to poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, is a very eaſy tranſition; the principle is the ſame. <q>They altered the Coronation oath for all future Sovereigns in this realm; and they altered the oath of allegiance for themſelves, and for all future ſubjects. They cut up, by the roots, the damnable doctrine of paſſive obedience and non-reſiſtance:</q> doctrines ſedulouſly endeavoured to be inculcated into you to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night; that non-reſiſtance and paſſive obedience, though couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in other words, were the duty of the ſubject. I ſay it is no ſuch thing; and here is an honeſt man declaring this in Parliament, and nobody deſiring to confute him. He ſays, <q>they cut up, by the roots, the damnable doctrine of <hi>paſſive obedience</hi> and <hi>non-reſiſtance,</hi> by <hi>emphatically</hi> ſpecifying and ordaining the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words of their former oath, 1 William and Mary, ch. viii. I declare, that it is not lawful, upon any pretence whatever, to take up arms againſt the King, &amp;c. &amp;c. ſhould not, from thenceforth, be required or enjoined.</q> Therefore, you ſee, Gentlemen, that it is no longer required of the ſubject to take an oath; that he will not, in any circumſtance whatever, take up arms againſt the King; becauſe, as this King comes to the throne, not by divine right, but by a contract between the King and the people, it was thought, if he neglected his contract on the one part, the people were not bound by that contract on the other, and, he hereby eſtabliſhes the doctrine of reſiſtance to oppreſſion: in fact, ſelf-preſervation is the firſt law of nature with an individual; and, what is the caſe with an individual is much more ſo with a ſociety. <q>It was not ſo much to relieve the conſcience of the ſubjects, that theſe words of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer oath were ſelected, recited, and aboliſhed; for no oath of ſlavery ever did, or ever will, or ever ought to bind a nation, or an individual; it was ſomething worſe than perjury, or ſacrilege, to keep an oath of ſlavery.</q> Here is the true ſpirit of freedom, breathing in theſe words: it was ſomething worſe than perjury, or ſacrilege, to keep an oath of ſlavery. No; man was not born to ſlavery. <q>This alteration was made to prevent the future Sovereigns of this country from being miſſed, as the four preceding Sovereigns had been, to truſt to a ſenſeleſs ſuperſtition about <hi>Royalty,</hi> which though many perſons for their intereſts have profeſſed, no man of common ſenſe ever entertained.</q> Many of theſe doctrines are profeſſed at this day: men profeſs doctrines very different from what their hearts
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:027594_0125_0FD54DF522AA7B30"/>
feel; but while blinding the eyes of the Public, they are the moſt conſcientious men living. <q>Their next care was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the due adminiſtration of the Executive Power, and the reſponſibility of its confidential adviſers. They therefore enacted, 12th William III. chap. ii. that all matters and things relating to the well-governing of this kingdom which are cognizable in the Privy Council, by the Laws and Cuſtoms of this Realm, <hi>ſhall be tranſacted there,</hi> and all Reſolutions taken thereupon <hi>ſhall be ſigned</hi> by ſuch of the Privy Council as ſhall adviſe and conſent to the ſame.</q> Here you ſee, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that the government of a large country, like Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, is of ſo public a nature as not to admit of ſecrets; it is of ſuch a nature that a reſponſibility muſt be affixed ſomewhere, and therefore thoſe perſons who adopted meaſures in the Privy Council were to ſign the ſame, in order that the public might know where the blame or the praiſe lay; this has been done away, and you have heard to-night, when a queſtion was put relative to orders, thoſe orders were deemed proper to be kept a ſecret; thus we imitate the practices of thoſe in higher ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and inferiors will naturally catch at the defects ſooner than at the beauties of their maſters' behaviour. <q>Thereby guarding, as far as Laws could guard, againſt that accurſed engine of deſpotiſm, <hi>a Cabinet Council,</hi>
                  </q> which the paper I juſt now read, calls a Secret Junto, <q>or that more accurſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, an Interior Cabinet,</q> from which we have not been free for 25 years.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Their attention was next directed to the <hi>double</hi> repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the People, the only poſſible ſecurity for all their other proviſions.</q> There is undoubtedly no proviſion, no ſecurity, for the liberty, for the property of the Subject, if he is not properly repreſented in Parliament: we are too numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to make Laws for ourſelves; we muſt therefore be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented; we muſt ſend Delegates or Commiſſioners to a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where a convenient number of them may meet and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act the buſineſs of the Nation; if that buſineſs is not done faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; if the men ſent to do that buſineſs are liable to be bought and ſold, we ſhall in our turns pay both Purchaſer and Purchaſed —"The Houſe of Commons and Juries." This is the double repreſentation in England; we were the only Nation who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed it.</p>
               <p>A neighbouring Nation, though much run down, have lately arrived at the poſſeſſion of it. Juries conſiſt of twelve or fifteen men, according to the country in which they act. They are not to ſtand in fear of the Judge, or in fear of the King; for, if they act according to their conſcience, no Judge dare ſay any thing to an honeſt Jury; they have a double duty; the firſt to God, and the next to their country; but they both of them form a moral duty, and are one and the ſame thing. Jurymen are abſolute; they have a right to aſk queſtions, they have a
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:027594_0126_0FDC0540871ACD48"/>
right, where the leaſt doubt hangs over the mind, to enquire of the Pannel; they have a right to enquire of the Counſel, and they have a right to call forth all the wiſdom of the Judges; while in office they poſſeſs the moſt unlimited power that we know of in England. He ſays, <q>Our Anceſtors paſſed over un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched, and left them as they found them the Nobility and the Church; they were conſidering the ſolid and ſubſtantial parts of the Conſtitutional Edifice, and did not much concern themſelves about the <hi>gilding</hi> and the <hi>varniſh.</hi> They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proceeded to eſtabliſh the principle of a <hi>fair</hi> and <hi>free</hi> and <hi>frequent</hi> election of the Repreſentatives of the Commons in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, as might be ſeen by a reference to the acts paſſed in the firſt and ſecond and third years of William and Mary.</q> You ſee here, a term which at firſt appears to be a kind of ſneer or joke, but it is founded in truth, and leads you to a much deeper reflection. He ſays, <q>Our Anceſtors did not much concern themſelves about the Gilding and the Varniſh,</q> meaning the Nobility and the Church; and it is not merely a jeer or a play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon words, but ariſes from the principle already laid down, that the Nation, and the Nation alone, is the principal part: it is the People that are of conſequence, and nothing but the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <q>And having thus, as they imagined, provided for the <hi>real</hi> election of the Repreſentative body in Parliament, they ſecured the independence and integrity of that body after its election, by enacting, that no Perſon who has an office or place of profit under the King, or receives a penſion from the Crown, ſhall be capable of ſerving as a Member of the Houſe of Commons.</q> Now, if this took place with regard to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Aſſembly, where Laws are only made; undoubtedly a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar reſtriction was underſtood to be in full force in that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, where the Laws are carried into execution, I mean in Juries; for if men enjoying places of profit under the Crown are deemed incapable of making Laws, they ſhould by a much ſtronger reaſon be deemed incapable of carrying them into exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, eſpecially when there is no appeal from their Verdict; or at leaſt, an appeal attended with ſuch difficulties and ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, as to put it out of the power of nine tenths of thoſe who are tried to make uſe of the remedy. <q>Having thus ſecured the purity and independence of the people's repreſentatives in Parliament, they proceeded to the other important branch of their repreſentation by Jury, and they decreed that Juries ſhould be fairly taken without partiality, and ſhould act free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without influence.</q> Obſerve that, Gentlemen; I don't im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it to the caſe of to-day, but when I ſay it is poſſible to pack a Jury, I can ſhew my authority, when it has been aſſerted in the Houſe of Commons, and has not been denied. <q>They alſo decreed, that <hi>exceſſive bail</hi> ſhould not be required, that <hi>exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive fines</hi> ſhould not be impoſed, and that <hi>illegal</hi> and <hi>cruel</hi> puniſhments ſhould not be inflicted; and to ſecure theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:027594_0127_0FD54DF7C3271D18"/>
they ordained that thenceforward the Judges commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſhould be made <hi>quamdiu ſe bene geſſerint;</hi> and that their ſalaries ſhould be aſcertained and eſtabliſhed, in order to make the Judges independent of the Crown.</q> The duty of a Judge is, not to influence you, not to ſay any thing that has the leaſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to influence you; he is to explain the Law in any difficult point to you, but by no means to give you his opinion upon the caſe; he is merely to ſtate the Law, and ſay always, hypotheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, if the man is guilty of the offence, ſuch and ſuch puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is due to it; but he is never to ſay, let me beg of you to ſay ſo and ſo; it is illegal, it is the higheſt pitch of wickedneſs in a Judge ſo to do. <q>Now, all theſe proviſions (the objects and conſequences of the glorious Revolution) would have no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, they would be nugatory and worthleſs; they would be a mockery unleſs they were effectually to obtain and ſecure to the People of this Land theſe three important points, <hi>Firſt,</hi> An honeſt and <hi>reſponſible</hi> exerciſe of the <hi>Executive</hi> Authority. <hi>Secondly, Real</hi> independent and faithful Repreſentatives of the Commons in Parliament. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A fair and impartial admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of Juſtice in the Courts of Law. We who had no predilection for <hi>any</hi> family whatever (except as connected with theſe objects) in the words of our Anceſtors at the time of the Revolution, did now again <hi>claim, demand,</hi> and <hi>inſiſt,</hi> upon all thoſe as our undoubted <hi>Rights,</hi> the <hi>true, ancient,</hi> and <hi>indubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi> rights and liberties of this kingdom, 1ſt William and Mary, chap ii. If then by various means it had happened, as he aſſerted, and undertook to prove (in a Committee of this Houſe,) that this proviſional reſponſibility of the Privy Council no longer remains; that the election of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons is neither, <hi>fair,</hi> nor <hi>free,</hi> nor <hi>frequent;</hi> that this proviſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al independence of its Members is gone, and that the Houſe, at preſent, <hi>ſwarms</hi> with Perſons having offices and places of profit under the King, and receiving penſions from the Crown; that Juries are not fairly and impartially taken; that they do not act freely and without influence; that exceſſive bail may be, and has been, required; that exceſſive fines may be, and have been, impoſed; that illegal and cruel puniſhments, may be, and have been, inflicted; that the Judges are not indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the Crown; that penſions may, and have been, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, upon others, by which means it cannot be ſaid that their ſalaries are aſcertained and eſtabliſhed. If theſe facts were ſo, he held it to be the duty of all thoſe who, without hypocriſy, praiſed the Revolution.</q>—</p>
               <p>Moſt men, perhaps all men, praiſe the Revolution, but they do it with various intentions; but he ſpeaks here only of thoſe who praiſe it without hypocriſy. He ſays, <q>he held it to be the duty of all thoſe who, without hypocriſy, praiſed the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to endeavour to return us again to our conſtitutional ſituation at that period, and to recover thoſe loſt or neglected
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:027594_0128_0FDC05378AE71F58"/>
proviſions, that ſo we might effectually ſecure to ourſelves and to our poſterity, what our Anceſtors endeavoured at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution to ſecure to themſelves and to us.</q> I hope that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle paſſage will be ſufficient to do away all the criminality of the word <hi>aſſert,</hi> in the Indictment. It may be done in two ways, by force, or by argument; in either caſe, it would be juſtified by the preſent glorious Conſtitution, taken not ironically; not inſidiouſly, as it is taken by ſome, but literally, according to the truth. Our glorious conſtitution permits us to aſſert our rights, and even permits us to reſiſt oppreſſion: however, from the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of the proceedings of the Convention, you will ſee that arms were the laſt things we ſhould have thought of; being little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured to arms, and being a ſmall number to the bulk of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I mean the aſſociated men, who have ſent their Delegates to the Britiſh Convention; and from what has happened to-day, you will ſee that the public mind is panting for Reform; and I hope, Gentlemen, if your countenances deceive me not, that you all, or the greater part of you, wiſh for Reform; an amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be attended with no ill conſequences. Mr. Wharton concluded with moving, <q>That a Committee be appointed to enquire whether any, and which of the proviſions made by Parliament in the reign of William and Mary, and in the reign of William III. for ſecuring the reſponſible exerciſe of the Executive authority; for ſecuring a real, independent, and faithful repreſentation of the Commons in Parliament; and for ſecuring a fair and impartial adminiſtration of juſtice in the Courts of Law, whether any, and which, of theſe have by any means been invalidated or taken away; and to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whether any, and which, of thoſe loſt or invalidated pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions may be fit to be re-enacted and reſtored, in order that the people of this land may recover that ſituation and ſecurity in which they were placed by the glorious Revolution in 1688.</q> This motion, I have already told you, was loſt, and it was loſt by a majority of 71 ſilent men, againſt 11 honeſt men who ſupported it; but the 71 did not utter a ſingle ſyllable, though I firmly believe the Lord Advocate was in the Houſe at the time: if he was not there, his maſter, his father, his uncle were there, and not a word was ſaid; they put it to the ſilent vote, and numbers carried it, which ſhews you what chance we have of obtaining, by an humble ſubmiſſive petition to the Houſe of Commons, any redreſs; it ſhews you, that if we want to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain redreſs, we had much better go to the fountain of redreſs, and apply, in the firſt inſtance, to the King; but that is a thing that is matter of opinion; however, it requires conſideration; and when the matter of reform comes to be more public, which I hope it will, it will then bear ample diſcuſſion.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I have, I believe, in the former part of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, mentioned to you, that the Lord Advocate not being able to ſubſtantiate his charges againſt me upon written evidence,
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:027594_0129_0FD54DFB213D71F8"/>
was forced to draw in a more powerful aid; namely, a blank, as a proof of criminality; he has laid great ſtreſs upon it; he has turned about in it like a horſe in a mill, and though he went back from it once or twice in the courſe of his ſpeech, he was ſure to return to it again. He has likewiſe ſought to attach a great degree of criminality to the words Convention of Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, which is a ſimple Engliſh word, ſignifies a caſe of great moment, a caſe that requires ſpeed, that requires immediate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, that requires all the exertions we can poſſibly beſtow upon it; therefore ſtrip it of the epithete, ſeditious, malicious, felonious, and all theſe high ſounding words, and you find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it unjuſtifiable whatever. He has alſo ſought to crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate me, with charging that my friend Browne gave a hiſtory of the Habeas Corpus Act; and he has wiſhed to attach, more than ſedition, a kind of treaſon, to the bare mention in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the wrongous impriſonment Act; ſurely, if ſuch an Act exiſts, it is competent to every ſubject of the realm to ſee that it is ſecured to them; that it was (as I preſume all Acts are) made for the benefit of the Public, and therefore it is natural that men ſhould be anxious that thoſe benefits ſhould be retained to them; yet it ſhould ſeem that the bare mention of ſuch a thing is Treaſon in Scotland. It galls thoſe in power, to think that they have got a power above them; that they are not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely above control; but I have already ſaid that there is not a man in the kingdom above control; even the King holds his Crown by a contract, and therefore is not above control; he is not above the Laws; he is not, indeed, reſponſible; the fiction of law ſays, he can do no wrong, becauſe his contract holds no longer than he abides by the Conſtitution of the kingdom; the moment he would attempt, as a James, or a Charles I. to break the contract between him and the People, the moment he had broken that contract, he would then no longer be unaccountable to the People. On the contrary, it is moſt likely, the People would call him to an account, as they have done in other caſes before, when they have ventured to ride paramount over the Laws. The Laws are made for the weal of the Nation, and are of more importance than any individual, in whatever rank ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety may have placed him; they are of more importance than any individual, for without Laws there is no Society; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any individual whatever, the Society may ſtill remain a Society.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I will come now to the mere points of the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for the ſpeech of the Public Proſecutor has wandered greatly from the mere facts ſtated in the Indictment: however, I was obliged to follow him, inaſmuch as he did me the honour on Monday laſt, of trying me before another Jury; for it was me more than Skirving that he tried; it was me he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in his mouth; and, to me, that a great part of his ſpeech then applied. He taxes us with holding deluſive Republican
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:027594_0130_0FD7BFD62D0C9BA8"/>
principles, and he builds his crimination upon our having adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed certain words, which he ſeems to think were never in uſe in England, before the Revolution took place in France; he is however much miſtaken, for there is not a ſchollboy but can tell him that <hi>ſection</hi> was as much in vogue, and made uſe of, in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land 20 years back, as it is now; there is not a Writ for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of a Member of Parliament, but has the word Citizen in it: the word Citizen is in all the Students cards; and even the Pin-makers of London, are obliged to have the word Citizen in their cards; therefore it is not an adoption of any thing new: as to regulations and orders, if they are founded upon French princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, for God's ſake, give me French principles; and that we were regularly and orderly, I will take the liberty to prove to you. By the regulations that I will read to you, you will ſee that we were far from having any ſeditious or diſorderly princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples about us; but that we were organizing ourſelves into the moſt regular body in the world, and, I believe, even Freemaſons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who have regulations and ſecrets, and, I believe, ſome of their committees are pretty ſecret; meet together, and therefore are guilty of all the crimes I am charged with; and I don't know that there is ſo much regularity even in their proceedings, as there was in our's. <q>The Convention ſhall henceforth be called, The Britiſh Convention of the Delegates of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, aſſociated to obtain Univerſal Suffrage and Annual Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments. The Delegates of this Convention ſhall be elected annually, on the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> and ſhall meet where the Secretary and intermediate commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee ſhall think moſt adviſeable for the general intereſt.</q> You ſee it is for the good of the generality; not for the good of one deſcription of men; not for the good of the oppoſition, who are endeavouring to ouſt the Miniſtry in hopes of getting into their places. No, let us ouſt the abuſes, and reſtore the Conſtitution to the ſtate in which it was in 1688. <q>The Secretary, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate Committee, may, at any time, call a Convention of the Delegates, on 14 days notice; but they ſhall be reſponſible for a proper exerciſe of their authority. The Convention after electing a Preſident by ſhow of hands.</q> Here we call him a Preſident; that is not a French word; I fancy that is a word that has been uſed in England for theſe 50 years back, and I cannot attach any degree of criminality to it, becauſe we did not put it in the power of a man, to ſay he was ſent by a certain number of people, unleſs he was intruſted with the confidence of thoſe men, for the purpoſe of a Parliamentary Reform, as I will ſhew you by the inſtructions that I brought from London, which I have in my pocket, and which eſcaped the Inquſition. <q>The Convention, after electing a Preſident by ſhow of hands, ſhall proceed to the verification of power, and then to the diviſion of the Convention into Sections, in ſuch manner as ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be provided.</q> Here follows the head of Office Bearers.
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:027594_0131_0FD54DFE87091DF0"/>
The public proſecutor told you he could not tell what this Preſes meant; this will explain it. <q>There ſhall be a Preſident or Preſes, three Aſſiſtants, a Secretary, a Treaſurer, and Door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers. The three Aſſiſtants and the Secretary ſhall form a Council, to be denominated the Council of the Table. The office of the Preſes is to maintain order, to take the ſenſe of the Convention on all queſtions to be determined therein, and to declare on which ſide the queſtion is carried, to call on the Committees for reports, &amp;c. and to ſign all Public Acts.</q> You ſee there is nothing ſeditious in the office of Preſes; unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately that night there was no Public Act paſſed; I kept order, or endeavoured to do it, as well as I could. I took the ſenſe of the Convention, and declared on which ſide the queſtions were carried: an explanation of that you will ſee by and bye, under a ſeparate head. <q>The office of the Council of the table, is to keep order in the <hi>buſineſs</hi> of the Convention, as particularly ſpecified under the head Council. The office of the Secretary is to take charge of all writings and papers belonging to the Convention; to iſſue ſummonſes, write and diſpatch letters, &amp;c. &amp;c. according to the orders of the Convention, and the requeſt of any Committee, during the time of their ſitting; and ſhall have acceſs, on all occaſions, to every Committee during its ſitting.</q> This was made a crime in Skirving, when you ſee it was the duty of his office, to attend as many commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees as he could ſpare time for. <q>The office of Treaſurer ſhall be to receive and pay all monies ſubject to the regulations to be at any time adopted by the Convention or Committee of Finance. The office of Door-keepers, is to prevent the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of any perſons not Members except by ſpecial leave of the Council of the Table.</q> This was to prevent improper company; I do not mean ſpies, for on the contrary, when they were known they were preferably admitted though with the contempt they deſerved, and which no claſs in Society can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve more than themſelves, unleſs it be the men who employ them. And now follows the head of Committees. <q>No Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee ſhall be compoſed of more than thirteen, or leſs than three perſons; and the number of each Committee ſhall be decided by a ſhow of hands in the Convention. All Committees ſhall be choſen, unleſs otherwiſe ordered, at the time of their appointment; and they ſhall be authorized to invite the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſuch Members of the Convention as they may think beneficial to the buſineſs entruſted to their charge. All Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees ſhall be elected from the Leet of the Sections, unleſs found neceſſary for ſome immediate purpoſe, in which caſe they ſhall be appointed by the Convention, one by one, by a ſhow of hands; and they ſhall ſit and report progreſs, day by day, until their buſineſs is completed.

comes the head of Council of the Table. <q>There ſhall be three Aſſiſtants, elected from a Leet given in by the Sections, one to be renewed, and the ſenior to go out of office daily.</q> Thoſe who had the greateſt number of votes were elected, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of that, the Convention was likely to be beſt ſerved, for they neither bought their electors nor ſold them when they had bought them. <q>The Secretary and Aſſiſtants ſhall form the Council of the Table; they ſhall prepare a ſtate of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, for each day ſhall arrange the order in which the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſubjects ſhall be taken into conſideration, which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement ſhall be adhered to, unleſs the Convention ſhould alter the ſame by a vote; they ſhall permit a Member from each Section to take copies of all motions, &amp;c. to be ſubmitted to the conſideration of the Sections, and ſhall aſſiſt all Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers who requeſt their aid, in the wording of any motion they may wiſh to lay upon the table.</q> This brings me back again, to a motion that has been introduced againſt me as written evidence, and which Wardlaw was called to prove: he ſaid, and it was not leſs to the diſgrace of thoſe who brought him forward, than to the Friends of the People, of whom he was a member, that he came in a ſtate of inebriety: he ſaid he had written out that motion; it is a motion drawn up not by me, but by the Council of the Table, and it is ſtated in the indictment. <q>To do this your Committee ſuggeſts a reſolution to the following effect, but which I ſhall leave to be drawn up by the Council of the Table,</q> The ſpirit of the motion was that which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, of which I was the Reporter, had to report, and which motion was to be drawn up by the Council of the Table. <q>The Council ſhall have the power to interrupt any debate, for the purpoſe of propoſing to the Convention any other buſineſs which they may think more urgent; but the Preſident ſhall take the ſenſe of the Convention by a ſhow of hands, whether the debate ſhall be interrupted or not.</q> Here you ſee this is the greater part of their duty, to judge of ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as were laid before them; if they were nugatory they were to inform the perſon who brought them of it; if otherwiſe, they were to endorſe them on the back, they were to hand the motion to the Preſident, he was to read it to the Convention, and then the vote of the Convention was to determine whether the buſineſs was of ſufficient conſequence to depart from the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the day. Then follows an article which gives great um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage to thoſe who are frightened at every thing that looks like French: It is the head of Sections: we had the name of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and of claſſes; but, no name which was agreed to by every body at laſt; Section was agreed to by a great majority; and we thought no more of the French Convention at that time, than we did of our new ally the Grand Turk.</p>
               <p>To explain to you then what is meant by Sections, and the cauſe of adopting that word, which was more from accident
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:027594_0133_0FD54E012592BE70"/>
than any thing elſe, it goes on. <q>All the members of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention ſhall be divided by lot, into Sections of 15 perſons each.</q> And why divided into Sections of 15 perſons each? It was not with a view to overturn the government; it was not with a view of being ſeditious, or riotous, or any thing of the like, but with a view of their meeting, as we had many country Delegates who had much leiſure on their hands, for the purpoſe of giving them uſeful employments: in the morning they uſed to meet and diſcuſs the news of the day, and little political to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pics, and thereby came better prepared in the evening; and in the courſe of one week we already found a great difference in their political information; they had already learned to connect their ideas, and form a more accurate judgment of the buſineſs they were about. They were alſo to pick out the men who were moſt proper for the nomination of Preſident for ſhe next night, or for the Committees. Theſe were the felonious and ſeditious employments of the Sections in the morning. <q>The Members who may not be able to attend at the firſt diviſion into Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſhall be divided by lot among the Sections formed; but, if any Section ſhall have two more than its proper num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, no new Member ſhall draw for that Section until the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are again equal. Every Section ſhall be furniſhed with a complete printed liſt of the Convention, containing the name, ſurname, and the ſociety, which each individual repreſents.</q> And you ſee, Gentlemen, here is great regularity; and where men uſe ſuch regularity, they cannot be called a riotous tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous aſſembly. <q>The Sections ſhall be renewed on every Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day during the ſitting of Convention.</q> Now, I maintain, that there is no principle in our Britiſh Conſtitution, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents mutual communication from one man to another, but will encourage that intercourſe; for union alone can make us ſtrong, as has been ſaid, though in a different ſenſe, from the Bench. <q>The Sections ſhall meet every forenoon, at eleven o'clock, each in a ſeparate place; and ſhall daily chooſe a Chairman for the Section, who ſhall report their leets of election, &amp;c.; and, if theſe reports are not delivered into the Council of the Table, immediately on the Chair being taken, they ſhall be deemed null; each Section ſhall daily furniſh itſelf with a note of all the buſineſs, and with copies of all motions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports to be taken into conſideration that evening. The Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall daily diſcuſs the buſineſs of the Convention; they ſhall prepare liſts of ſuch perſons as they may think moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for Offices. Committees, &amp;c.; but the Sections cannot fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally decide any matter; nor, in their collective capacity, give an opinion, or make a propoſal to the Convention. No Member in the Sections ſhall be allowed to vote by proxy.</q> We did not, you ſee, intrench on the privileges of the Houſe of Lords, where they vote by proxy; and we thought, that as every man was equally intereſted in the buſineſs, that he ſhould
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:027594_0134_0FD54E02B218C888"/>
attend as often as he could; and, if he did not, it ſhould be his own loſs, by loſing his vote. <q>The members of one Section ſhall not be received into any other Section, during its ſitting; and, no perſon not a member of the Convention, can, on any conſideration, be admitted.</q> And, I am ſure, there is not a man here, who would wiſh to be intruded upon by ſtrangers, in the ſocial hour, over the bottle, but the ſervant comes up with his name, before he is admitted. <stage>(Here Mr. Margarot drank a glaſs of wine)</stage>. I beg pardon, Gentlemen, for this interruption; I ſhould not have done it, if the example had not been ſet me; we have no ſuch thing in England, Gentlemen, as a Jury eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking in Court.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, The next head, is that of motions, A great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of criminality has been attached to the motions that have been produced; but, notwithſtanding all this written evidence, which is to tranſport us, and prove us nearly guilty of high trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I will ſhew you the innocent manner in which theſe things were to be carried on. <q>All motions ſhall be in writing, ſigned by the Mover and Seconder, and tranſmitted to the Council of the Table, who ſhall number and file them, according to the order in which they are given in. At the cloſe of each day's buſineſs, and before the adjournment of the Convention, the Secretary, or one of the Council, ſhall read all motions given in, during that ſitting, according to the priority of delivery, in order that they may be copied, and taken into conſideration by the ſeveral Sections; and, being ſo read, they ſhall come on for debate the following ſitting, in the ſame order of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement, made by the Council, unleſs the Convention ſhall think proper to prefer any one of them, as containing matter of greater importance, or more urgent neceſſity. A motion once rejected, cannot be brought forward again in the ſame Seſſion of the Convention, unleſs requeſted in writing by 20 members.</q> This was thought proper to be introduced, in order to ſave us trouble, as there were ſome men who could ſpeak better than they could write; and who, perhaps, might wiſh to be buſy; for we already began to ſuſpect that we had got ſpies among us, and that motions of a dangerous tendency might be brought in; and, therefore, we endeavoured to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent being led into a trap; for, we found that, in general, it is the moſt honeſt men that become the dupes of knaves. <q>In caſe of two or more motions being on the table, which relate to the ſame object, and tend to the ſame end, the Council, and the reſpective movers, ſhall uſe their beſt endeavours to conſolidate them all into one before they are diſcuſſed: but, in caſe the Council and the reſpective movers cannot agree in ſuch meaſure, then the ſame ſhall be finally determined by the Convention. Notwithſtanding the above regulations, any Member may ſubmit a motion, at any time, to the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Convention, which he deems to be of greater
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:027594_0135_0FD54E0423422F20"/>
importance, or more urgent neceſſity than any of thoſe which ſtand in the order of the day; and, if from the reaſons ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced by ſuch Member, a majority of the Convention ſhall coincide, in opinion, with him, ſuch motion ſhall be immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately brought forward, and determined.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now, here is that which was drawn up with more care than any other part. We know debates often lead to warmth; and, that when diſputants wax warm, they generally grow tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and irregular. We have ſeen theſe tumults, and this rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous manner of debating, even in the Houſe of Commons: we ſought to avoid it; and therefore, we ordered, that <q>no perſon ſhall ſpeak in the ordinary ſittings of the Convention, more than once on the ſame ſubject, unleſs it be to explain, or by ſpecial leave of the Convention; but when all who wiſh to ſpeak to the queſtion have done ſo, any Member may be heard again; and, every Member who opens a debate, ſhall have the privilege of being heard, the laſt, in reply, before the diſcuſſion be finally cloſed. If it ſhall appear to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or ſeconder of any motion, or to any other member, that the matter contained therein requires the moſt ample diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, on motion, for that purpoſe, made and agreed to, the Preſes ſhall leave the Chair, for the purpoſe of the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reſolving itſelf into a General Committee, in which, a Chairman being firſt appointed, every Member ſhall be at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſpeak as often as the Committee may think proper to hear him, till the queſtion ſhall be called for by an apparent majority. As ſoon as the queſtion ſhall be called for, and the diſcuſſion cloſed, the Preſident ſhall reſume his ſeat, and the queſtion ſhall be determined in Convention. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil ſhall require the Preſident or Chairman; or either of theſe may, of his own accord, put a vote for cloſing the debate. When it appears to any of them to be the general wiſh of the Convention, or general Committee, there ſhall, however, be a vote taken; and two to one for cloſing the diſcuſſion, before it actually takes place.</q> Here we ſought, not only to avoid the heat of debate, but we ſought to avoid partiality, and we ſought to avoid any prejudice that any man might have againſt another, or in favour of another, <q>The queſtion of cloſing the debate may, itſelf, be debated; but, it muſt be ſtrictly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, that no Member, under pretence of giving reaſons for or againſt cloſing the debate, ſhall go into the diſcuſſion of the main queſtion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The next head is, that of Order; a term not borrowed from France, but from the Houſe of Commons of England; for, in the Houſe of Commons, the order of the day is a common phraſe. <q>The Convention ſhall meet daily, at five o'clock in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, and ſhall proceed, <hi>Firſt,</hi> To receive and verify the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of any new members. <hi>Secondly,</hi> To receive, without reading, the Liſts of Candidates from the Sections, <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
                     <pb n="136" facs="unknown:027594_0136_0FD7BFD4F3F763F8"/>
To read communications addreſſed to the convention. <hi>Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> To elect, from the liſts of candidates, the Committees, if any have been ordered, the new Aſſiſtant, and the Preſes. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> To hear from the Council, what is the whole buſineſs ſtanding for diſcuſſion; and what is that particularly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the day, with the order of priority, propoſed by the Council; which priority may there be debated, and fixed. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> To read over the minutes of the preceding day, and any former days, not finally ſettled, and direct corrections of the ſame, if need be.</q> 
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> To receive reports from the different committees.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>In going through the buſineſs of the day, the order of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority, fixed as above, ſhall be adhered to, unleſs altered by a vote of the Convention, which muſt, at any time, be put, if deſired by the Council; or, if required in writing, by any five members. Any point, once diſcuſſed and determined, can neither be reſcinded nor brought forward again on the ſame day; nor at all, but by a motion regularly made; and, for the bringing in of which, leave ſhall have been obtained the preceding day. The Reporter of any Committee ſhall always have a preference to the ordinary buſineſs of the day, to deliver his report to the Convention, ſo as not to break in upon any debate which may be before it. Members ſhall ſpeak in the order in which they riſe for that purpoſe; and, if more than one riſe at the ſame time, the Preſes ſhall decide who is entitled to priority.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The preſident alone ſhall have the power of interrupting any ſpeaker who wanders from the queſtion: but any indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual ſhall have the right to ſuggeſt his opinion, by writing the word <hi>order,</hi> and handing it to him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>No member is to be allowed to ſpeak to any ſubject after a ſhow of hands has taken place on it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>You will ſee by this, that we were not only far from ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly inclined, but we did not give our tongues a looſe: we were obliged to ſpeak in order, and methodically take our turns, and ſay nothing further than what we were entitled to. You will from that gather, that a ſociety ſo well regulated, could not be for the purpoſe of overturning the Conſtitution, which, in its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſtate, is regularity itſelf: we were proceeding in a way that directly led to a reform: theſe are the heads; and there remained five more to be finiſhed, when we were apprehended by general warrants, and the meeting diſperſed by the power of the Sheriff, and of the Lord Provoſt; therefore, if we are not in order, it is not our fault, but the fault of thoſe who inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted us; yet, you will ſee, that we were not altogether ſo illiterate as ſome men, and men of ſhining, perhaps more ſhining than ſolid, abilities have thought proper to repreſent us. We knew what we were about; and all this was done openly: we have had fifty viſitors of a night: any perſon ſending in his
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:027594_0137_0FD7BFE484E73020"/>
name to the Council of the Table, was his admiſſion ticket; and, as I obſerved to you, we ſought nothing but the public good: we ſought a Parliamentary Reform; we ſeek it ſtill; and, I truſt, we ſhall to the end of our lives; and a renovation, not a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, but a renovation of our Conſtitution. Gentlemen, I will now come to the plain facts ſtated in the indictment, and then, I will make a few remarks upon the evidence that has been given; and, Gentlemen, I am ſorry to detain you ſo long; but, it is my duty to be as explicit as poſſible, in this matter, as well as yours to liſten to it: was it my own individual buſineſs, I would meet your verdict this inſtant; but I have already told you, that I conſider myſelf as the leaſt concerned in this matter; it is the cauſe of Reform.</p>
               <p>The indictment, Gentlemen, accuſes me of having been made a Delegate by an Aſſociation of ſeditious people, calling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Correſponding Society of London.</p>
               <p>Now, Gentlemen, either the charge is true or falſe; if it is falſe, it is malicious; if it is true, then I am the ſeditious perſon I am repreſented. The London Correſponding Society is not a ſeditious ſociety; it is a ſociety eſtabliſhed upon as regular and as ſyſtematical a plan as that of the Convention. We are proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to increaſe, to diffuſe political knowledge, to make every man acquainted with his political rights: we are formed into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, becauſe, we well know, that large companies introduce diſorder and confuſion; therefore, we never ſuffer, except when general meetings take place: we never ſuffer above a certain number to aſſemble together: we aſſemble in private houſes; neither eat nor drink; but calmly and coolly diſcuſs the political ſubjects before us: we inſtruct the ignorant, and receive inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from thoſe that know more than we do; and, therefore, the charge that this is an aſſociation of ſeditious people, is a falſehood; and, the Public Proſecutor backed it with another falſehood, on the night he did me the honour to try me, inſtead of Mr. Skirving: he aſſerted, that this ſeditious ſociety had held a meeting for the purpoſe of chooſing Delegates; and, that they were ſo deteſted by the mob, that the magiſtrates were obliged to protect them. I was not at liberty to anſwer him that night; nor ſhould I do it now, eſpecially in his abſence, but that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions unfavourable may have gone forth. It is ſaid, that the magiſtrates, an odd doctrine for a crown lawyer to advance, were obliged to take under their protection the ſeditious Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Society, in electing Delegates to ſend to Edinburgh. If the Correſponding Society was ſeditious, why did not the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates quell us? they were preſent; and they came with a deſign to diſperſe us; but the laws are paid a greater regard to in the metropolis than they are at ſome diſtance from it; and, when they found we were acting upon conſtitutional principles, they dared not moleſt us: there were 500 conſtables; and, out of theſe 500, I will, to be ſure, ſay, there were, at leaſt, 300
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:027594_0138_0FD54E0962FF2310"/>
out of them, who maintained the ſame principles that we did, that a reform was neceſſary; that it might be imprudent if the magiſtrates had acted otherwiſe than they did. If any illegal open act of violence had taken place, it muſt have been occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by them; but they did not commit any act of violence: on the contrary, we placed ourſelves under the care of the high conſtable, and his poſſe; and they attended; but, as in the teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of the Lord Provoſt, if any riot was occaſioned that day, it was from the magiſtrates, and their attendants, for our Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, being ſo numerous, were obliged to meet in an open field; or, at leaſt, a field encloſed with palings: it was in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of Spitalfields; and the people in the neighbourhood, led by curioſity, and not kept at home by work, being out of employ, and might as well dine upon the freſh air as the ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate air of Spitalfields itſelf, they attended our meeting to the amount of thouſands, and behaved as orderly as thoſe men you ſaw to-day come up the ſtreets; they behaved with the utmoſt decency; and the Police Magiſtrates, from the Police Office, with their police runners, attended, but did not dare to moleſt us more than that we invited them to attend our meeting, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it was conſtitutional; knowing that they ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe certain perſons in power, who ſhall be nameleſs, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined accepting the invitation of attending; but, after I was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, I returned them thanks for the polite attention they had paid us: they aſked us whether we were to chooſe Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Parliament; I replied, No; that our object, at Edinburgh, was to communicate with our brethren here, who were like our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, purſuing a Reform in Parliament; that would be our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs in Edinburgh. I told them, if they had any commands, I would execute them: they politely bid me a good day, and drew off their Conſtables; and found themſelves to be very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in being protected by us: it is true, Sir, the High Conſtable came to me, and begged of me, as a means of diſperſing the mob, that I would deſire the Members of our Society to diſperſe quietly, foraſmuch as there might be ſome riot, ſome tumult. I told him, if that was the caſe, we would to a man turn out and aſſiſt the civil officer: that as Reform was our aim, ſo was order; and, that we would, on every occaſion, protect the civil officer; and, at the ſame time, that we aſſiſted him in his duty, we would take care that he did it. And, Gentlemen, my behaviour has been perfectly regular; I have been always ready to come for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and face my country, againſt any charges, except, at the firſt inſtance, when I was aſſailed by ſix blackguards, or meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; or, whatever they were, I told them, Take my word, that when ever they required my preſence, I would be forthcoming: the ſame was the caſe in this Court; yet, I did not heſitate to appear; I never will fly from juſtice; I will always abide by it; beſides, Gentlemen, if the London Society was ſeditious, but it is not, it is ſanctioned by a letter, a copy ſhall be given to each of
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:027594_0139_0FD54E0AE83DC9D0"/>
you, to peruſe at your leiſure: you will ſee, that it was a Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety founded upon our conſtitutional principles; that none of the Miniſters dared offend us: it is true, laſt year, ſeveral aſſociations were formed all over the kingdom; and, it is they who ſounded the tocſin; and, where did they originate? they originated in about eleven placemen; the Preſident, the Chairman of that Society, poſſeſſes only five places; he was a clerk, or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrapper, of Lord Hawkeſbury, his name is Reeves: at the ſame time, to prove to you the further conſtitutionality of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, we did, in the month of April, hold an aſſembly, at the Crown and Anchor, in the room above this very man, who was for protecting property againſt republicans and levellers: this very man, obliged to bite his nails, in the room underneath, dared not ſhew his teeth; but he can write; and he is aſſiſted; I will not ſay by the treaſury, but he has pecuniary aſſiſtance, and has laid the public under contributions; and, here I apply to an obſervation of the Public Proſecutor, that we drew money from the deluded, the poor, and the weak. Would to God, no man drew more from the poor, the deluded, and the weak! If no man enjoyed more ſinecure places than we do, every fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would have bread; which is not now the caſe; while thoſe who draw money from the poor, the weak, the deluded, and, I may add, the oppreſſed, are revelling in riot and luxury, and all manner of profligacy: while they ſell themſelves, while they ſell others, and their crimes, they cut a figure; but let them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that every guinea that they poſſeſs, conſiſts of a certain number of drops of the blood of the poor. He ſays, being named a Delegate by an aſſociation of ſeditious people, calling themſelves the Correſponding Society of London, did repair to Edinburgh, with the wicked and felonious purpoſe of joining and co-operating with an illegal aſſociation of evil diſpoſed and ſeditious perſons, who originally deſigned themſelves the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Convention of the Friends of the People. Now, it ſeems, that the original Friends of the People, were an illegal aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; were an aſſociation of evil diſpoſed and ſeditious perſons. In the indictment, it ſays ſo; but, in the pleading of the Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor for the Crown, he ſays otherwiſe; he ſays, that they were harmleſs, that they were allowed; and, indeed, the behaviour of the Magiſtrates toward them, ſeems to prove the legality of their inſtitution: he goes on, and charges us with holding vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous illegal and ſeditious meetings: how came they to be illegal? If the Friends of the People were in the firſt inſtance legal, how came they to be illegal and ſeditious? or where are the proofs that he brings of it? He likewiſe ſays, they met under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of procuring a reform.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, you are not to be caught by words: you are men of ſenſe, and ſenſe alone is to operate upon you; reaſon and ſound ſenſe: how is he to tell? how is he to prove? in what manner has he proved that theſe were only pretences?
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:027594_0140_0FD54E0CACCC6628"/>
On the contrary, what I have already ſhewed you betrays a great ſyſtem of regularity and order; and order will never be introduced for the ſake of forwarding confuſion; and yet, he ſays, they were evidently of a dangerous and deſtructive ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency; though I ſtartle at the words, evidently of a dangerous and deſtructive tendency; yet, if you allow me to add a few words to that ſentence, I will ſhew they are ſtrictly true; for, if you apply theſe words to the abuſes which have crept into the Conſtitution, you will make Engliſh, you will make ſenſe, and you will make truth of it. He ſays, we imitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the form and tenor of our proceedings, that Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of people, the avowed enemies of this country: theſe people, the avowed enemies of this country, fight with guns, bayonets, and cannon: we do the ſame; and, yet I don't ſuppoſe that we are guilty of oppoſing, arm to arm: the Houſe of Commons, whom we are ſeeking to reform, and wiſh to new model, if poſſible, upon the plan of a more frequent renovation, uſes the ſame regulations that we do; but order can never be criminal. Gentlemen of the Jury, he ſays, likewiſe, that I did act as Preſes or Chairman of their meetings: this, likewiſe, he has failed to prove: he has proved that I acted once as Chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and, therefore, cannot be guilty of acting as Chairman at their meetings; at leaſt, he is inaccurate in his language; but, in England, ſuch an inaccuracy would be fatal to the indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Although it has been ſaid that I was an Attorney by one; and, by another, that I know nothing of law, I hope to prove, that I know ſomething of the Conſtitution; and, that if I am no At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney, I have as much honeſty as any Attorney, or any Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of the gown. It goes on, that various inflammatory votes and reſolutions were paſſed. Of this, I truſt, the Public Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor has failed to produce an evidence: there is no vote, no reſolution of an inflammatory nature, inaſmuch as to underſtand the word inflammatory; it means, not merely, that which will inflame itſelf, but that which will inflame others: now, the word introduced, as inflammatory, had no manner of connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Convention at large, and was ordered by it, to have been burnt: there, indeed he is right; it might have been inflammatory; when burning, it was inflammatory; but that inflammatory nature was no way ſeditious. Continuing then, in the ſwollen and deluſive language of the indictment, he ſtates, that the ſaid Maurice Margarot, did alſo, "when attending in his capacity of Delegate, at the illegal meetings of the ſaid Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, utter, and make various ſeditious and inflammatory ſpeeches, tending to vilify our preſent happy Conſtitution, and to withdraw therefrom, the confidence and attachment of our ſubjects." I have already proved, that the only end of our meeting, was to revert to our Conſtitution; but, it ſeems, that there is a terrible confuſion of ideas. He accuſes me with hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:027594_0141_0FD54E0FE6886528"/>
while attending my duty, as Delegate, in theſe meetings of the Convention, with having made ſeveral inflammatory ſpeeches, tending to vilify our preſent happy Conſtitution; and, to withdraw, therefrom, the confidence and attachment of our ſubjects: That that is a wrong ſtatement, will be evident, at firſt ſight: by what you have already been told, you muſt have diſcovered, that men, ſeeking a Reform, cannot wiſh to do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to that very Conſtitution which will procure to them that Reform; for, we are not ſo blind as not to ſee, that our origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Conſtitution, if we revert to its original principles, does give us the Reform we want; but his way of proving the inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ſpeech is very curious. And, particularly, the ſaid "Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice Margarot did, at a meeting of ſaid Convention, held on Tueſday, 19th November laſt, 1793, or on ſome other day of that month, in a Maſon Lodge, or room in Blackfriars Wynd; in the city of Edinburgh, wickedly and feloniouſly make the following motion, or one of a ſimilar import." This, you will recollect, is to be the vilifying of our preſent happy Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and our withdrawing therefrom the attachment of our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Now, you will ſee what that motion is, which he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces in ſupport of that proof: That, previous to publiſhing an Addreſs to the Public, a Committee be forthwith appointed to conſider the means, and draw up the outlines of a plan of general union and corporation between the two nations, in their conſtitutional purſuit of a thorough Parliamentary Reform. He brings you forth a motion, as written evidence; and, he tells you, this is done for the purpoſe of ſubverting our preſent hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Conſtitution, and withdrawing therefrom the attachment of our ſubjects: you certainly will not take it amiſs, if I recal to your mind what I ſaid before, that it was an attempt to impoſe upon your underſtandings; for there is not one of you fifteen that has a ſervant about your houſe, ſo imbecile, as to ſuppoſe that a plan of union would tend to vilify our preſent happy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and withdraw, therefrom, the confidence and attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our ſubjects: it might, very well, when helped for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with all the brilliancy of geſture, of language, of action, which he is poſſeſſed of; but, when you come to look into it, it is a direct falſehood: let us call things by their proper name: it is a direct falſehood; it does not ſupport itſelf then further, that motion having paſſed unanimouſly; and, which motion, clearly demonſtrated a wiſh and intention on the part of the ſaid Maurice Margarot, of propagating the ſeditious tenets of that Aſſociation over the whole kingdom; and, of exciting our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in England, in contempt of legal authority, to adopt the ſame unconſtitutional conduct with the ſaid Maurice Margarot, and his aſſociates, had preſumed to follow. Gentlemen, I have been told, that in Scotland, I am as much a ſtranger as if I had come from Germany, from Italy, from America; and yet, a Court which cannot bring witneſſes from England, can try me
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:027594_0142_0FD54E10E31B2AD8"/>
for what was charged to be done in England: in ſhort, it is a farrago of nonſenſe. Were I better acquainted with the Public Proſecutor, I ſhould have thought he meant to have ſet forth my poor ſervices in the Convention; and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, brought me forward to explain the nature of it, the contempt of legal authority. Where has it been ſhewn? No where: on the contrary, we had the auction of legal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; Pitt and Dundas both knew we were coming down: the Magiſtrates of Edinburgh knew we were aſſembling for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; unleſs the contempt was, that we did not go and aſk them leave: perhaps, had we been ſtrolling players, we might; for, I am told, that a town-hall, not far from Edinburgh, was refuſed to the Friends of the People; and, the next night, permitted to a company of ſtrolling players: probably the ſtrolling players are the moſt beneficial members of ſociety. Gentlemen, you ſee what hardſhips I labour under, no being able to get at my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culpating witneſſes and papers, the witneſſes being above the laws of the country. The Lord Advocate, when he ſays it was in contempt of legal authority, utters a falſhood: not even your Lord Chief Juſtice Laing, who goes about knocking people down in the ſtreet, his legal authority had not ſhewn itſelf; and, therefore it was not in contempt of any legal authority what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. We took our own room; burnt our own candles; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body had any thing to do with it but ourſelves: there was no contempt of any legal authority; and, therefore, that part muſt be expunged; as alſo, that which relates to England; over which, you ſay, you have no juriſdiction. Again, I find among my high crimes and miſdemeanors, the word <hi>tocſin;</hi> and, a learned Judge has ſaid, that we took it from the French: ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon has ſaid, taking up, I ſuppoſe, what had dropped from the learned Judge, that it was a French word: unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately it happens to be borrowed even by them: it is a Chineſe word, ſignifying a ſhrill ſound; a bell that is rung when danger is near; and, you know, the greater part, or all the words of the Chineſe language, mean one and the ſame thing; and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are obliged to couple a member of them, in order to convey what they mean, eſpecially when it carries a complicate idea with it.</p>
               <p>Again, a motion is deemed very ſeditious; for, having appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Committee for the particular purpoſe of watching every act which may militate againſt the rights of the people; it is firſt falſe, that ſuch a Committee has been appointed; but, if it had been appointed, we ſhould, in the French term, have deſerved well of our country, for our vigilance; for, let me call to your mind, in all the high offices of truſt, you find very few people willing to ſtep forward, and ſerve you for nothing; and that would have been the caſe, if we had appointed this Committee: we ſhould have been labouring for you, at our own expence; being your centinels, watching, that none of your rights might
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:027594_0143_0FD7BFDE194A03A8"/>
be encroached, while you ſlept; but it may be proper here to animadvert likewiſe upon the blank that was produced as cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, and more criminal than the written evidence: it was ſaid, that the reſolution which ought to fill the blank, was of ſuch a nature, that it muſt not appear till the end of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions. I will explain that to the ſatisfaction of the Jury; but, it muſt be by reading to them the whole diſcourſe. Here is a motion, ſuppoſed to be made by Mr. Callendar, That in caſe the Miniſter, of any other Member, bring into the Houſe of Commons, a motion for a Convention Bill, as paſſed in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, for preventing the people from meeting, according to their juſt rights, by the Revolution, the ſame motion ſhall be noticed to the Delegates of the reſpective Societies immediately, to meet in Convention, to aſſert their rights; and, then they make me ſay, this is an excellent motion; and the event which it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes to, ought to be the tocſin to the Friends of Liberty to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: it ſeems, however, to be imperfect; it does not mention any place of meeting: neither does it ſpecify the time when the Delegates are to aſſemble; for the word <hi>immediately</hi> is indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and will not convey the ſame meaning to perſons reſiding in different parts of the country: by thoſe who live near to the place of meeting, it will be underſtood, that they are to repair there next day; by thoſe at a greater diſtance within a few days; and by thoſe ſtill farther off, within a week after ſuch informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is received. Gentlemen, you will remember, I have read to you eight chapters, the produce of the Committee of Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; you will ſee what ſpirit actuated them, when they draw up thoſe regulations; and that there was nothing ſeditious in their tendency. Here, I am then made to ſay, that this motion comes properly under the chapter of regulations; I wiſh it were referred to that Committee; I therefore move, that the report be read, that the Convention may judge, whether the article I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude to, ſufficiently provides for the intention of the motion now before the Convention. Here you ſee, firſt, my diſſent to that motion of Mr. Callendar's: the one which the Committee of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations had drawn up, was in a different ſtyle, and would have come in extremely well at the end of the regulations; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of which, the Convention ſpliced the one with the other; they adopted the motion of Mr. Callendar, and propoſed to bring it in as amended by Mr. Sinclair, and others; and, the next day, they propoſed to bring it in at the end of the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; that the only myſtery that has given ſo much uneaſineſs to the Public Accuſer; while, at the ſame time, he might have done away a great deal of your ſuſpenſe, and, likewiſe, have made himſelf much eaſier; for, I believe, he is in poſſeſſion of that motion, but did not think proper to produce it, becauſe it would not have anſwered his end of criminating me; however, I will invalidate it entirely, for the Public Accuſer is bound to bring forward the beſt evidence he can adduce: he has not
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:027594_0144_0FD7BFDF2D496628"/>
brought that evidence forward: he has told you, that he has got it, but has not produced it; therefore, you are not to believe him on his word; and, I believe, that is not the only falſehood point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, that will engage you to diſbelieve any thing he may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert. I will read a paſſage from the Gazetteer, which will ſhew, that other men have been the victims of his falſehood, as well as myſelf. Gazetteer, 7th January, ſigned by a man of great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectability, both as to truth and fortune; a man ſtill more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable by education, and by his virtue; he is a man poſſeſſed of 6000<abbr>l.</abbr> a year, and upwards; lays the chief part of that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney out, not in luxury, or in profligate living, but in relieving the neceſſities of the poor; I mean Mr. Archibald Hamilton Rowan, who has been called one of the wretches of Ireland.</p>

               <p>This is what they call in plain vulgar Engliſh, giving a man the lye; and when the name is affixed to it, this man is of an equally high character, and his intrinſic character makes him rank at leaſt with the official character of the public proſecutor. I dare ſay he is not a man, who would fix his name to a falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; and if he had, his falſehood would have been contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted; and it ſeems that here the public proſecutor is very full of ſpirit, and therefore would have reſented this injury. He has ſilently acknowledged the truth of it, and the man who will tell a falſehood in one inſtance, will tell it in general; therefore be wary how you truſt merely to his aſſertion, eſpecially with an object like this in view, the extirpation of abuſes upon which he and his relatives fatten; for his uncle reaps upwards of 20,000<abbr>l.</abbr> a year of the public money as Secretary of State. Were abuſes to be rectified, theſe ſalaries would be diminiſhed; were theſe abuſes to be rectified, it is poſſible his conduct would be enquired into as moſt likely it will ſpeedily. You ſee by this, Gentlemen, that where any thing tending to exculpate me could be adduced, he has kept it back; but he has not done it ſimply and fairly, but aggravated it; I have greater proof of this man's guilt, but I will not produce it; whereas, it is an extenuation of guilt. Here is another act of criminality in this motion; by the by, it ſeems very inconvenient in the practice of the law of Scotland, that one crime may affect many perſons, if it is only by holding
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:027594_0145_0FD54E15C4AC9C08"/>
finger to finger, art and part as it is called here; and here, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, it may be as well to revert to the opinion of the Solicitor General of King William upon that ſubject. Sir John Hawles ſays, <q>As Juries have ever been veſted with ſuch powers by law, ſo to exclude them from, or diſſeiſe them of the ſame, were utterly to defeat the end of their inſtitution; for then if a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould be indicted for doing any common innocent act, if it be but clothed and diſguiſed in the indictment with the name of treaſon:</q> So that you ſee, even in King William's time, there were frivolous perſecutions as well as at preſent; I meant to call them proſecutions, I beg pardon; and that if the Jury did not ſtep in between the crown lawyer and the ſubject, the ſubject having no redreſs, was incarcerated, fined, baniſhed, or otherwiſe ill uſed, and all for things, which in themſelves were perfectly innocent; but being clothed in tremendous lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, appear heinous crimes, ſuch as I was mentioning juſt now, and is reported here; <q>If any perſon ſhould be indicted for doing any common innocent act, if it be but clothed and diſguiſed in the indictment with the name of treaſon, or ſome other high crime, and proved by witneſſes to have been done by him, the Jury, though ſatisfied in conſcience that the fact is not any ſuch offence as it is called, yet becauſe (according to this fond opinion) they have no power to judge of law, and the fact charged is fully proved, they ſhall at this rate be bound to find him guilty.</q>—Thus you will if you find me guilty, refer me to the mercy of the court—I ſhall not detain you much longer; you have attended me with ſingular patience, Gentlemen of the Jury, and I thank you for it—you are doing your country good. Diſtinguiſh then the true friends of your country from its foes. You have ſeen that the teſtimony of every witneſs adduced on the part of the Crown is one weaker than another; that it all turns upon the point of the meeting being Seditious; whereas, in verity, as the law term is, the meeting was founded upon the claim of rights—that it is the privilege of the ſubject to ſeek redreſs; and I muſt take the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of quoting to you ſomething from De Foe, which will prove to you, that the people have a right—that the original power reſts with them, and that they have a right to control that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and keep on it a continual check; for as I ſaid before, the ſervant is not greater than the maſter, and the King is but the chief ſervant of the nation. It is true we do not exerciſe our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over him, or if we do, it is but once in two or three cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies; and I hope it will be centuries before we ſhall have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to exerciſe it again. But there are thoſe who exerciſe the regal power in his name, and the ſooner they are brought to condign puniſhment, the ſooner it will prevent others from pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing the ſame daſtardly purſuits. This is a chapter of De Foe; he is treating of the original power of the collective body of the people of England.—<q>To the King. Sir, it is not the leaſt of
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:027594_0146_0FD54E16E0A19788"/>
the extraordinaries of your Majeſty's character, that as you are King of your people, ſo you are the people's King. This title, as it is the moſt glorious, ſo it is the moſt indiſputable in the world. God himſelf appointed, the prophet proclaimed, but the people's aſſent was the finiſhing, the royal authority of the firſt King of Iſrael. Your Majeſty, among all the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of your reign, has reſtored this as the beſt of all our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, the full liberty of our original right in its actings and exerciſe.</q>—</p>
               <p>This was publiſhed in the year 1705, ſoon after the revolution. <q>Former reigns have invaded it, and the laſt thought it totally ſuppreſſed; but as liberty revived under your Majeſty's juſt authority, this was the firſt flower ſhe brought forth;</q> that is to ſay, the acting and exerciſe of our liberties and original rights, which are thoſe which you have ſeen in Mr. Wharton's ſpeech, of petitioning and obtaining redreſs; of keeping a conſtant check upon every ſervant of the Crown, in whatever ſituation he may be placed; and of obtaining a fair and equal repreſentation.</p>
               <p>He ſays in another place,—<q>I have obſerved, when intereſt obliges any perſon or party to defend the cauſe they have eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed, they pleaſe themſelves with fancying they conceal their private deſigns, like a late Act of Parliament, which in the preamble calls itſelf an Act for the relief of Creditors; but which in its effect, was an act for the relief of Debtors.</q> This is like men who cry up the Conſtitution, and live upon its defects. <q>Thus ſome Gentlemen place fine ſpecious titles on their books; as <hi>Jura Populi Anglicani;—A Vindication of the Rights of the Commons of England, and a Vindication of the Rights of the Lords;</hi> and with large and high encomiums upon the excellency of our Conſtitution, treat the levity of ſome people's judgments with fine notions; whereas, the true end and deſign is defending the intereſt and party they have eſpouſed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Gentlemen, call to mind whether it may not be the caſe with one of us two, the Pannel or the Public Proſecutor, whether we may not be trumpeting up or ſounding the praiſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and at the ſame time have intereſted and private views; and as it has been ſaid you cannot penetrate into the minds of men, you can only judge from the tenor of their conduct; hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto he has acknowledged himſelf to be a placeman, though not a penſioner. Gentlemen, I take my God to witneſs, that were I to be offered one of the moſt profitable places under Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, my conſcience would not permit me to accept the emoluments of it, when I know that it has been drawn from the blood and the ſweat of the poor: that there has been more blood ſpilt within this laſt twelvemonth, for the purpoſe of gratifying Miniſtry, and keeping the public mind from reform, than would completely fill the largeſt ſhip now in the Britiſh navy, and I ſpeak within compaſs, <q>The defence of the rights of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative body of the people, underſtood by the name of
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:027594_0147_0FD54E18651C4268"/>
the Common of England in Parliament, is a <hi>great point,</hi> and ſo plain are their rights, that it is no extraordinary taſk to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them; but for any man to advance, that they are ſo au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt an aſſembly, that no objection ought to be made to their actions, nor to reflect upon their conduct, though the fact be true; and that it is not to be examined, whether the thing ſaid be true, but what authority the perſon ſpeaking has to ſay, it is a doctrine wholly new.</q>
               </p>
               <p>You ſee, Gentlemen, it was a doctrine new a hundred years ago, in the time of De Foe, but it is a doctrine renewed now to ſerve theſe ſtate proſecutions; it is highly ſeditious, and of a very evil tendency in the public at preſent to examine into the conduct of the Houſe of Commons, and yet at that time it was conſtitutional; why, becauſe we have brought in the preſent family, and that they had entered into a contract with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; they would not ſuffer their ſervants to deviate from it at firſt; at preſent, through lapſe of time that is grown obſolete, and their ſervants' ſervants tell you, you are not even to examine into it; praiſe the Conſtitution, and think yourſelves happy, whether you are ſo or not. <q>It is doctrine wholly new, and ſeems to me to be a badge of more ſlavery to our own repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, than ever the people of England owes them, or than ever they themſelves expected. This therefore, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſome invaſions of the people's rights, made public by ſeveral modern authors;</q> You ſee the rights of the people were begun already, then to be invaded, <q>are the reaſons why I have adventured <hi>(being wholly diſintereſted and unconcerned either for perſons or parties)</hi> to make a ſhort eſſay at declaring the rights of the people of England, not repreſentatively, but collectively conſidered. And with due deference to the repreſentative body of the nation, I hope I may ſay <hi>it can be no diminution of their rights,</hi> to aſſert the rights of that body from whom they derived the powers and privileges of their Houſe, and which are the very foundation of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This refers to what I ſaid to you juſt now, the ſervant cannot be higher than the maſter; if they derive their powers from us, we entertain powers ſuperior to theirs; it is therefore our duty to ſee that they acquit themſelves of the taſk repoſed in them, and conſequently all the meetings of the people for thoſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes are conſtitutional, and not ſeditious and inflammatory, as ſounded by the Public Accuſer. <q>For if the original right of the people be overthrown, the power of the Repreſentative, which is ſubſequent and ſubordinate, muſt die of itſelf, and becauſe I have to do rather with reaſon and the nature of the thing, than with laws and precedents.</q> I am happy to find that De Foe ſtood in the ſituation I now do. I have, Gentlemen, to do before you with reaſon and the nature of the thing: I have to deal with your reaſon: I like that much better than law
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:027594_0148_0FD54E19F360BD90"/>
or precedents; reaſon is an emanation of the divine Being; laws are but the formation of that emanation, and the farther the rays diverge from the centre, the weaker they grow.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, you will find that the plain doctrine that I am laying down, has been the language of all times and all ages, is the doctrine of truth itſelf; and that I am acting for the public advantage, and not for private or perſonal emolument; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have to do rather with reaſon and the nature of the thing, than with law and precedents. The Crown Lawyers can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe and confound a man not bred to the law: They can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found a juryman with the duſt from the old muſty law books, and lull his reaſoning to ſleep with words conveying a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent meaning to what ought to be attached to them. <q>To come directly to what I deſign in the following papers, it is neceſſary to lay down ſome maxims other than what a late au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has furniſhed us with; <hi>ſalus populi ſuprema lex.</hi>
                  </q> This will not be controverted by any body, the welfare of the people is the firſt of all laws; and remember this, Gentlemen, <q>all government, and conſequently our whole Conſtitution, was originally deſigned and is maintained for the ſupport of the people's property, who are the governed.</q> It is for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the people, not for the ſupport of the governor, <q>that all the members of Government, whether Kings, Lords, or Commons, if they invert the great deſign of their inſtitution, the public good, ceaſe to be in the ſame public capacity.</q> You ſee, De Foe abſolutely ſuſpends them from their function, the moment they ceaſe to devote their talents to the public good. How many of our placemen and penſioners would be ſuſpended, if that law was ſtill put in execution! <q>And power retreats to its original, that no collective or repreſentative body of men whatſoever, in matters of politics any more than religion, <hi>are or ever have been infallible.</hi>
                  </q> Here is the axe at the root of the omnipotence of Parliament, <q>That reaſon is the teſt and touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of laws, and that all law or power that is contradictory to reaſon, is <hi>ipſo facto</hi> void in itſelf, and ought not to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Some other maxims leſs general, are the conſequence of theſe: as <hi>Firſt,</hi> that ſuch laws as are agreeable to reaſon and juſtice, being once made, are binding both to King, Lords, and Commons, either ſeparately or conjunctively, till actually repealed in due form.</q> Thus much, I differ from many great men in the law at preſent; who ſay, that a bad law when once found to be a bad law, ought to be diſobeyed in order to get it broken. On the contrary I am for obeying, and every good ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen is for obeying and paying reſpect to the laws, and to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the laws; and while a law is in force, let it be never ſo bad, I will obey it; I will point out if I can the errors of the law, but I will obey it while it is in exiſtence; from that confeſſion of faith, you may eaſily ſuppoſe that another article of accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will fall to the ground, which is that our Convention was

to aſſemble and militate againſt the Parliament, in caſe of the introduction of a Convention Bill: We were to overawe in the language of the public Proſecutor; to overawe the Parliament; to check them in their proceedings: ſo we were: but how? as a body of men we could do nothing till we had a majority of the nation on our ſide. When once the majority of the Society is of one way of thinking, it is proper that the minority ſhould yield to it, and that is the firſt law of Society; and as the general good is to be paramount to every thing, ſo the will of the few is to ſubmit to the will of the many; and therefore, the object of our inſtitution was firſt to diffuſe political knowledge; and ſecondly, to gather the general will. If we found that general will, to be for a reform in Parliament, a Reform in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament we ſhould obtain; if we are to be ſlaves, it is our duty then to ſit down ſilent, and if not ſatisfied, we may as a noble Lord has ſaid, take our pack on our back, and be trudging. My Lord, at another ſeaſon I might not talk improfitably, but at the preſent late hour of the night, I think in my mind that I have ſaid ſufficiently to acquit myſelf of all the charges laid againſt me, if you will be kind enough to diveſt yourſelves of any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice which public papers, public rumours, or public prejudices, may have inſpired againſt me; to examine not merely the man; I am myſelf, a willing and a devoted victim to my country.</p>
               <p>I know if I am left to the mercy of the court, how that mercy will diſplay itſelf; but if it can profit the cauſe that I ſhould be a victim, I am willing it ſhould be ſo: I have faced death before now: I am not afraid of it now, you ſee that I am not agitated. I am as cool as yourſelves; I have ſtudied this affair well: I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook it not ſanctioned by a Pitt, a Richmond, or a Dundas: I adopted it upon reaſon and juſtice, and I will quit it only with life. Gentlemen, you repreſent you country: your ſituation is awful; you are now to guard its liberties; you are now to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the plant of reform; a mild and peaceful reform, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the temper of men's minds, now may be eaſily effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but beware of perſecution carried on with too much rigour. We know, and hiſtory ſhews us, that at a certain pitch of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion the people will bear it no longer, and an uninformed multitude, is what every well-ſtudied government, every well conducted government ſhould fear to incenſe. It has been the policy of Europe, and it is a popiſh policy, and I am ſorry to ſay, we now number two among our Allies who make much uſe of that policy; I mean thoſe who encourage the inquiſition and the bow-ſtring, the Pope and the Turk, who have both now ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors at our Court. It is their policy that the people ſhould be ignorant; it has been the policy of the prieſthood, it has been the policy of falſe politicians; but I hope the time is coming, when men will open their eyes to their true intereſt, and that ſeaſon when riches are no longer to be poured upon one man without meaſure, while a thouſand others are ſtarving. It is
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:027594_0150_0FD54E1DA75054C0"/>
neceſſary that there ſhould be a diſtinction of ranks, and it will take place, but let merit be the way to public offices; ſtudy that, and you will find yourſelves better ſerved, not as the preſent cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom is, the couſin of one Lord, and the ſon of another is to be the proprietor of a borough; theſe are things much wanted to be reformed.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, you have ſeen how ſlight the charges againſt me are; you have had intimation of what the mercy will be that I ſhall experience. A further intimation that orders have been iſſued, though the part from whence thoſe orders came, have not been developed to you; yet let me recur to your claim of rights; it is contrary to the laws of Scotland, that any Magiſtrate of Scotland ſhould act according to any order whatever, except it is according to the laws of Scotland, but not according to the orders of any ſtranger. You are in this caſe, without an appeal in Scotland. You are the repreſentatives of the people; they have entruſted you with their rights and privileges; you are to pronounce on me, whether I am guilty or not. I have appeared here to anſwer to my country. I hope I have done it to the ſatisfaction of my country, and I hope you will do it honor by your verdict; though the ſophiſtry of the public Proſecutor has appeared in all its defects, I hope that ſound ſenſe and reaſon are at work in your minds, and I hope there is not one among you fifteen, but what is poſſeſſed of an honeſt heart. Conſider; I tell you conſider not me—conſider your country. Conſider the cauſe, and conſider the futility of the charge that is brought againſt me. I am ſorry to have detained you ſo long, but it is a ſerious affair, and your verdict will not be confined within theſe walls; the eyes of Britain are now upon you fifteen men, whom I don't even know by name, and who perhaps never ſaw me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, nor I you; then examine me well, ſee if there is any thing ſeditious in my appearance or behaviour; ſee if there is any thing illegal in what I have done, though not verſed in the quirks of the law; and I am glad of it, for I believe the laws, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the laws by the practice, have made many an honeſt man a knave. You will ſee whether I am guilty of the charge laid againſt me, what proportion of guilt is attached to me; whether any part is proved home to me; whether any part is legal proof, and whether I was not ſerving my country; and I cannot heſitate a moment to think but that your verdict will do honour to your country, and juſtice to me.—Gentlemen, I take my leave of you.—</p>
               <p>Give me leave now to call to your Lordſhips attention, your particular duty.—</p>

               <speaker>Lord Juſtice Clerk.</speaker>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, I dare ſay every man in Court is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued, as I own I am; and after hearing it will not be neceſſary to detain you much longer; but I ſhall make a few general obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which I apprehend may be of ſome uſe in forming a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon this caſe. The crime here charged is the crime of Sedition; and although it is not founded upon any ſtatute law, it is a crime very well known in the common law of Scotland, and indeed is coeval with the very juſtice of ſociety. When man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are in a ſtate of nature, every man is a law to himſelf; but as ſoon as ſociety is formed, every member of that ſociety be under obligations to one another; to that ſociety of which they are members, to maintain the law and conſtitution of that ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety; and every attempt to encroach upon the conſtitution of that ſociety, is a very heinous crime, and very ſeverely puniſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Gentlemen, it is a crime which affords different degrees of aggravation; according to the nature of it, it may be applied to private matters, and may be leſs criminal in that caſe, according to the circumſtances. But whenever Sedition has a tendency to overturn the eſtabliſhed Conſtitution of the kingdom, it becomes a crime of the moſt heinous nature, and of the moſt dangerous tendency, and it borders indeed upon the crime of high treaſon. Gentlemen, the libel here lays the crime charged in the major propoſition, as Sedition; and the public Proſecutor has ſtated a variety of facts and circumſtances, from which he infers the crime of Sedition, and the concluſion of the libel is, that all or a part thereof being proven, then he is to be puniſhed with the pains of law; which pains of law in this caſe, is an arbitrary pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and which the Court will make more or leſs, according as they think the circumſtances of the caſe deſerve it.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, although the Proſecutor has detailed a variety of facts and circumſtances, all of which I ſhall ſhortly ſtate to you, yet it is not neceſſary that every fact and circumſtance ſhould be proved, in order to obtain a verdict of guilty; becauſe, if you are of opinion that ſuch facts and circumſtances are proved, as are ſufficient to eſtabliſh againſt the Pannel an accuſation of the crime of Sedition, it founds you in a verdict of guilty. If upon examination of the whole circumſtances of the caſe, you ſhould be of opinion, that nothing is proved to eſtabliſh the crime of
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:027594_0152_0FD7BFEFAD6E7670"/>
Sedition againſt him, you will find him not guilty, or the libel not proven. And, Gentlemen, the firſt thing to be attended to is this, whether the Society who call themſelves the Britiſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Delegates, from what you ſee of them, can be reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned a ſeditious ſociety or not;—that is the firſt thing you will inveſtigate. And, Gentlemen, it is a very material circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which you will have under your obſervation in forming your judgment; and it is this that that Society ſtands upon, the record of this Court not above ſix or ſeven days old, to be a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious ſociety; when a perſon, a ſecretary to that ſociety, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that capacity, and a member of that ſociety, was found guilty of the crime of ſedition, and has been by judgment of this Court condemned to tranſportation for fourteen years, that is a pretty ſtrong circumſtance to ſhew that this was not an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent meeting. If it was a lawful meeting, I am afraid that poor man, Skirving, has ſuffered very unjuſtly. In the firſt place, there was a unanimous verdict of a moſt reſpectable Jury againſt him. And, in the ſecond place, the Court pronouncing judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon that verdict. And indeed, Gentlemen, independent of what was eſtabliſhed upon the trial of Skirving, I think you will be to conſider, whether upon taking a complex view of the proceedings of the ſociety, it has been eſtabliſhed this day by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>role evidence, but chiefly by written evidence, which is not ſo capable of error as the other. I ſay, whether upon the whole of the evidence of what has been ſaid before you, that this was not an innocent meeting, but a meeting of a moſt ſeditious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, they ſay that the meeting was for a lawful pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and that at the ſame time that they complain of the griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances that the ſubjects labour under, nothing more was meant than to obtain a reform in parliament. Gentlemen, that is the profeſſion of the meeting; but then they are obliged to ſay, that becauſe their attempting a reform in another mode was a much more criminal act if they did not prevail, but you will attend to the facts, and ſee how far what is proved in this caſe, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the idea of a reform in parliament; and when you ſee them holding out that the parliament is guilty of the groſſeſt irregularities, as having no regard to the laws or the good of the ſubject, and in ſhort, that we are at the brink of ruin. When that is the light in which they pretend to hold forth the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is impoſſible to believe but they muſt mean ſomething elſe than a reform in parliament; they could not well expect to get a redreſs of their grievances from a parliament whom they have thought proper to ſtate in ſuch terms.—</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, if a Society of ſo many people, dividing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into Sections, Committees, coming from the Sections, motions made, and upon this a Committee of Secrecy appointed, and a Convention of Emergency eſtabliſhed, and the ſittings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared permanent, and all that—Was this neceſſary for a reform
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:027594_0153_0FD54E22A473F478"/>
in parliament? I think there could be no occaſion for all this ſecrecy; an application to parliament ſeems inconſiſtent with the idea of it. I am afraid it muſt ſatisfy you—you will conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the whole of it, whether the evidence does not ſhew you, that ſomething elſe than a reform in parliament was intended. You ſee, that they have eſtabliſhed a Convention of Emergency, in the caſe of a Convention Bill being brought into parliament, ſimilar to that brought into the parliament of Ireland. Another was in the caſe of that meeting being diſperſed; and the third was in the caſe of an invaſion, or in caſe of the landing of foreign troops. Now ſuppoſing that they had nothing but fair and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt intentions in the caſe of a foreign invaſion, they were to join the government to repel that foreign force, was there any thing there that was an object of ſecrecy? I think the more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic their reſolutions were, when of ſo virtuous a nature, calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated ſo much for the good of the public, the more public they were, ſo much the better: and it could not be an object of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy.</p>
               <p>That therefore taking all theſe circumſtances together, I am afraid that there is nothing but what is irreconcileable with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence. But, Gentlemen, in order to conſtitute the crime of ſedition, it is not neceſſary that the meeting ſhould have had in view to overturn the conſtitution by mobs and by violence, to overturn the King and Parliament; for I apprehend, in ſome ſenſe the crime of ſedition conſiſt in poiſoning the minds of the lieges, which may naturally in the end have a tendency to promote violence againſt the ſtate, and endeavouring to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a diſſatisfaction in the country, which nobody can tell where it will end; it will end very naturally in overt rebellion; and if it has that tendency, though not in the view of the parties at the time, yet if they have been guilty of poiſoning the minds of the lieges, I apprehend that will conſtitute the crime of ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all intents and purpoſes. Now, Gentlemen, take a view of the conduct of this meeting, and attend to the time when all this reform, all this noiſe and declamation is made againſt the conſtitution; it is at a time when we are at war with a great nation, a cruel ferocious nation, that requires all our ſtrength, and not only our ſtrength, but the ſtrength of all our allies to get the better of them; and the greateſt unanimity is neceſſary. I ſubmit to you, whether a man that wiſhes well to his country, would come forward and inſiſt upon a reform, parliamentary or not parliamentary, at ſuch a criſis; which would create diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in the minds of the people, when every good ſubject would promote unanimity among the lieges to meet the common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. I ſay, in place of that, to bring forward a great reform in parliament is a thing totally inconſiſtent with the conſtitution of this country. I ſay, bringing it forward at that period is a ſtrong proof that they were not well wiſhers to the conſtitution, but enemies to it. I ſay that no good member of ſociety would
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:027594_0154_0FD7BFE1E0A306B8"/>
have taken thoſe meaſures. I appeal to you all, that you are living under a happy government, in peace and plenty, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſecurity of your lives and property, the happieſt nation upon the face of the earth; and when that is the ſituation of this country, I appeal to you whether I have not given a fair and juſt deſcription of it; for a ſet of men in that ſituation to raiſe a faction in the minds of the lower order of the people, and to create diſaffection to the government, and conſequently make a diviſion in that country. I ſay, theſe things appear to be from the very conjuncture at which they are brought for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſedition of a very high nature. Now, Gentlemen, you will take into conſideration the whole proceedings of this meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and take a view of what ſtands upon the records of this Court, that that Convention is already determined to be a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an illegal nature.</p>
               <p>The next queſtion is, whether you can pronounce this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man at the bar innocent. I will lay it down as a principle of law, and not peculiar to this country; it is the principle of the civil law, and I believe the principle of every law in every well-governed ſtate, that where a number of people are concerned in a crime, that each and all of them are guilty; part or part of acting in different parts in the commiſſion of the crime, as ſome may have been more active than others, they are all of them in the eye of the law equally guilty, and liable to puniſhment; that is the law of Scotland, and I believe of every civilized coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and therefore if this is an unlawful ſociety, the man that is preſident of that ſociety, is liable for every thing done in that ſociety; and is amenable to a court of juſtice, for the crimes there committed.</p>
               <p>Now, Gentlemen, the queſtion is, if this be a ſeditious Society whether you can pronounce Mr. Margarot innocent. In the firſt place, you ſee that the public Proſecutor has eſtabliſhed that he was ſent down to that very meeting from England, as Delegate; he comes down for no other errand under the ſun. He leaves his buſineſs of a merchant in London, and attends this meeting in the character of a Delegate; that I apprehend is taking a ſtrong part in the proceedings of this ſeditious illegal Society. You ſee him at all the meetings almoſt, and you ſee him the moſt active of all the meeting. He is chairman upon one occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and he is making ſpeeches and harangues upon another: and you will attend to that motion by which the Convention of Emergency was eſtabliſhed, by which a Committee of Secrecy was eſtabliſhed. The Committee of Secrecy conſiſts of four members, and the Pannel is named one of the four, that is in evidence before you; and if you take all theſe things together, he comes down to Scotland, leaves his buſineſs in London, and attending theſe meetings daily; you ſee him taking the active part, making motions, and making that very important motion for a Committee of Secrecy; and he was named one of the
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:027594_0155_0FD54E25230FE808"/>
Committee. I leave it to you, Gentlemen, whether you can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce him innocent of the crime of Sedition. Gentlemen, I own at the ſame time that this Pannel ſhews a good deal of ingenuity, though I cannot applaud his diſcretion or judgment. The crime charged is Sedition: and I think he took up four hours in a defence, which was ſedition from beginning to the end; finding fault with the Conſtitution, and I think a ſpeech of a very ſeditious tendency, and I will not trouble you with any more of it. I have given you the general idea of the caſe; if you are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion nothing is proved againſt this Gentleman, find him not guilty; on the other hand, if you think the facts and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſufficiently brought home againſt him, you will find him guilty.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, you have pronounced a very accurate verdict. This is a trial of great importance, and the country is obliged to you for the attention you have paid to the cauſe. If you have any thing to ſay, Mr. Margarot, now is the time.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Margarot.</speaker>
               <p> Undoubtedly I have, my Lord. I did not yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday ſtart objections on futile grounds. I objected to the competency of the Court; I object to it at preſent; I informed
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:027594_0156_0FD54E2700215340"/>
your Lordſhips, that I meant to bring an appeal againſt the whole procedure, in conſequence of that incompetency. You thought proper, at that time, to repel my objection, but I now ſtill ſuſtain it: it is in conſequence of the abſence of the Lord Juſtice General of Scotland; I was charged to appear before him: he does not appear in his place; I did my duty, he neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his, and the Court was not full; and it certainly was neceſſary that he ſhould attend, otherwiſe the Indictment would have run, the Lord Juſtice General, the Lord Juſtice Clerk <hi>or</hi> the other Lords; inſtead of which, it ran, <hi>and</hi> the other Lords of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary: That implies the abſolute neceſſity that he ſhould be in his place; or otherwiſe, the Court was not even by the Public Proſecutor deemed complete. I likewiſe mean to bring an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, full as forcible, which is that which I experienced in the courſe of my trial. I was not able, though I had performed all the neceſſary legal ceremonies, I was not able (becauſe ſome men do not pay that reſpect to the laws which they ought to do) to adduce ſeveral of my exculpatory witneſſes: your Lordſhips refuſed to grant me a caption; your Lordſhips' refuſed to grant me delay; conſequently, the moſt material evidences, that I could have brought in my own defence, were entirely denied me: but, my Lord, although that denial was in conſequence of an aſſertion of this Court, that your Juriſdiction did not extend to England; yet, a part of my Indictment was ſounded on crimes ſaid to be committed in England, and relative to the people of England. It is odd, that you ſhould take cognizance, in this Court, of crimes relative to the people of England, when from England you cannot compel the attendance of a ſingle witneſs in my favour.</p>
               <p>There is, my Lord, an objection again, which is entirely local, which is confined to Edinburgh itſelf: I have ſummoned, three men, as exculpatory evidences; two of them were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, the third was not attending; but no notice was taken of him. Theſe men I wiſh to call into Court, to examine as exculpatory evidences for me. The Lord Juſtice Clerk inſiſted upon my telling the nature of the queſtions I intended to put: I gave him the outlines of them, upon which he thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to refuſe the admiſſion of thoſe evidences.</p>
               <p>Another charge relates to yourſelf: I had ordered the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger to ſummon your Lordſhip upon certain facts, which went to prove, that it was very likely I had already, before my trial, been prejudged. Your Lordſhip was not ſummoned, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the fear of this man offending a perſon in power, but, at the beginning of the trial, your Lordſhip told me, and the Public Proſecutor, to his juſtice be it ſaid, acknowledged that the legal point ſhould be obviated, and that you ſhould attend as an exculpatory evidence; but when it came to the point, you refuſed to be put upon your oath, and to anſwer the queſtions propoſed to you. Thoſe queſtions went to criminate yourſelf, my
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:027594_0157_0FD54E2847A7BF50"/>
Lord; they remain unanſwered, by the advice of your brother Judges. The conſequence was, that my defence was neither ſo complete, my exculpatory evidence not ſo ſatisfactory, and I make no doubt but that it is owing to that that the Jury, of whom I ſhall take no notice at preſent; that is the buſineſs of their country, not of me; that the Jury have thought proper to find me guilty. There is another thing, ſhould theſe objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be repelled; I have another to bring forward, that will not ſo eaſily be got rid of. It ſeems to be the cuſtom of Scotland, that the witneſſes are confined to a chamber by themſelves, and no ſtranger admitted amongſt them; that was not the caſe yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday; a perſon, of the name of James Carliſle, was converſing with them a conſiderable time in the outer houſe. Theſe are great objections for ſtaying judgment. The two firſt objections go to cancel the whole proceedings, and the three laſt at leaſt to ſtaying of judgment. I have no more ſay at preſent.</p>

               <p> My Lords, this Pannel has ſtated the very ſame objections that he ſtated yeſterday, except one, which ſtates that there were ſtrangers with the witneſſes in the other room; and, if it was ſo, the officer who had the charge of them may be culpable and puniſhable; becauſe it is contrary to the cuſtom of the Court: but, my Lords, to ſay that it ſhall annul a verdict, or ſtay judgment, does not appear to me to be at all the practice. It is impoſſible for the Court but to proceed upon the verdict, and I muſt give my opinion upon this head, that it is not a valid objection.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Eſkgrove.</speaker>
               <p> My Lords, The Pannel now at the Bar had more indulgence than the Court ever gave a Pannel before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was a ſtranger. My Lords, I cannot help taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of an inſinuation, on the part of the Pannel, to the Court by threats of impeachment, and threats of being brought upon our knees, or ſuffering the pains of death. I am happy the Pannel has not thought fit to renew that language to day; yet I would not fit altogether upon this trial, without ſignifying my opinion, that if it had not been, that we held in contempt inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations of threats to us, that are illegal; ſo, on the other hand, we will ſubmit to every appeal that is competent, if there is any ſuperior authority, we will readily ſubmit to their deciſions. But, my Lords, it is not for this man, or any man, to think to terrify this Country into a ſubverſion of juſtice. Had he been
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:027594_0158_0FD7BFE2EEE700F8"/>
a native of this country, he would not have been ſuffered to go on as he did. I approve of his conduct to-day, which is more temperate; but, for the ſake of others who might be here yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday, and ſome who may hear of it, I will ſay, that it is not the right of any priſoner to go out of his defence, and attack the Court, who are able to defend themſelves when the attack is made. I was of opinion, with my Brothers, upon the objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions yeſterday, and therefore it is not to be ſuppoſed I ſhould not be of the ſame opinion to-day, unleſs ſomething new had been urged. The objection as to the Lord Juſtice General was fully anſwered yeſterday, and does not deſerve any notice; as to the queſtions put to your Lordſhip not being anſwered, it was not becauſe of your being a Judge in this Court, but becauſe of their being irrelevant to his defence. As to his objection of a ſtranger being admitted with the witneſſes, I am ſorry that any ſuch thing ſhould happen. He may have been ſent from either party, or he might have no connection with any party; but it is a ſtrange thing to ſuppoſe, that ſuch an accident ſhould make null and void all the proceedings of this Court againſt this Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel; and I am the more ſurprized at that objection being made, on account of his being a native of England, where he muſt well know that it is the general practice that the witneſſes are not at all incloſed, but they are in Court during the time of the trial. Not but we allow that it is ſometimes ordered otherwiſe by the Court, and in this caſe it ſeems to have been by accident. It does not appear at all that he was tampering with the witneſſes; and therefore no blame lies upon the Court, and it is needleſs to ſeek any redreſs in the way in which it has this day been done from this Court.</p>

               <speaker>Lord Swinton.</speaker>
               <p> My Lords, The only new objection is, that a perſon of the name of Carliſle was admitted among the witneſſes; if that was valid, the objection is now too late; it ought to have been made when they were brought to be examined. My Lord, every witneſs, in a moſt ſolemn manner, was ſworn and aſked upon oath, whether he was inſtructed or taught as to the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he was to give, and an anſwer was made by every witneſs upon oath, that he was not; and therefore, if there was any thing in the objection, it was done away by that; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is my opinion, that it ſhould be repelled.</p>

               <speaker>Lord Juſtice Clerk.</speaker>
               <p> I am entirely of the ſame opinion, and I will tell the Pannel, that if the Court were to ſuſtain the objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it would not avail him as an abſolutary from the crime with which he is charged; even if it would make null and void all the proceedings; becauſe he would be liable to be tried over again. He muſt be convinced that he has had a fair trial; he went on for four hours in his defence; he is a ſtranger in this
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:027594_0159_0FD7C05C6CABFD48"/>
country, and not having counſel, we allowed him to go on in a manner in which we would not have permitted a native of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; he went on for four hours in ſuch a way as was contrary to the Conſtitution of the country, and your Lordſhip will now proceed in giving your opinion upon what ſhall be the reſult of this verdict.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Henderland.</speaker>
               <p> My Lords, The Jury having diſcharged their duty to their country, by a patient hearing of this trial, after, I am perſuaded, a full conſideration of the evidence, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains for the Court to conſider what may be an adequate puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the crime he ſtands charged with. My Lords, the crime of which he has been found guilty is ſedition, and it is detailed in the minor propoſition, taking an active and diſtinguiſhed part in the deliberations and proceedings of a ſociety, whoſe meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were held under pretence of procuring a Reform in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but which were of a dangerous and deſtructive tendency, with a determined intention to diſturb the peace of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and to ſubvert the preſent Conſtitution of the Country. My Lords, it is a moſt dangerous crime, and moſt extenſive indeed in its conſequences.—It appears in evidence that this was a Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, forming themſelves into a Society, calling themſelves Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, Sections, Committees. In ſhort, aſſuming the form of a French Parliament, thereby ſhewing that they wiſhed proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to take place here of a ſimilar nature to thoſe of France. My Lords, I fear not the ſword of the enemy, or the poignard of the aſſaſſin, while ſitting in my place, diſcharging the ſacred office of a Judge. I ſhall give my opinion as it ſtrikes my feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; I ſhall give my ſentiments, as they appear to me to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by Law. This charge is that of active Sedition; and the diſtinction between this charge, and that of leaſing making, is an imperfect one; for it is to demonſtration capable of being proved, that, before the union, there did exiſt Sedition, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by words in falſe argument, by attacks upon the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and upon the legiſlative bodies of the Conſtitution. It can be demonſtrated by the records of this Court, that there was a common law ſedition, different from leaſing making; and upon which this Court held itſelf competent to found a libel; to infer an arbitrary puniſhment. Therefore, in whatever point of view I take the charge againſt this man, (though I think it amounts to active Sedition), I have no doubt that this Court has power to puniſh it, by the higheſt arbitrary puniſhment.</p>
               <p>My Lords, I doubt not that what I now ſay will be made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic: I obſerve that it is falſely ſet forth, in one edition of a late trial, that I ſaid, it wrung my heart to mention the crime of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. I am in the judgment of your Lordſhips, and every man who heard me, I ſaid no ſuch thing—I ſaid, it wrung my heart (and I own that it did) to ſee a Gentleman, a young Gentleman, who had received a Gentleman's education and who had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered abilities not inconſiderable, ſhould be the object of ſuch puniſhment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="unknown:027594_0160_0FD54E2E21E3B860"/>My Lords, this Gentleman is a ſtranger, and ſorry I am that he ſhould have come into this country. I regret, as I muſt do, the conſequences it has had, and the conduct that he has aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It now becomes my duty, as a Judge, to ſay what ſort of puniſhment this crime deſerves; and, my Lords, I know no other way in which I could diſcharge my duty to God, to my country, and to my own conſcience, but by propoſing to your Lordſhips, that this man ſhould be baniſhed forth of this kingdom by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation; or, in common language, ſhould be tranſported to ſuch part of his Majeſty's Dominions, as his Majeſty, in Council, ſhall pleaſe to appoint; and there to remain for the ſpace of 14 years, under pain and penalty of death, in caſe of return.—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Eſkgrove.</speaker>
               <p> My Lords, the Pannel has been found, by the verdict of a Jury of his country, guilty of the facts charged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. My Lords, we yeſterday gave our opinions upon the validity of the Indictment, all, in one voice, finding that Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was a high crime, by the laws of Scotland. Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips were alſo opinion, that the facts charged and alleged by the Public Proſecutor, in the minor propoſition, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the crime of Sedition. I will not now repeat, what has been well obſerved by my Lord Henderland, who has gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, as to the grounds of that opinion. My Lords, as the caſe at preſent ſtands, I am ſorry this Gentleman ſhould have been guilty of ſuch a crime; but a Jury of his country have found that he is guilty of the charges in this Indictment; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I in no way differ from your Lordſhip in thinking, that the Jury have diſcharged a duty to their country: but, if I had been of another opinion, my duty would have been one and the ſame, which is to pronounce the ſentence of the law upon the perſon found guilty, by his country, of the crime charged, and carrying it into execution, by a puniſhment ſuitable to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. It is unneceſſary to go through the circumſtances of this Indictment, upon all of which the Jury have returned a verdict, finding the Priſoner guilty. My Lords, it may amount to the finding him guilty of leading, as well as aſſiſting, a number of people, ſtyling themſelves a ſort of Parliament in this country, for the purpoſe, as I ſtated yeſterday, of ſubverting the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the country; and then there is a more ſpecific enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of facts: it ſets forth, that they were to ſet at defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance the authority of the legiſlature; that even if an act was moved for, diſagreeable to them, they were to meet in a ſecret Convention; they thought fit to be concealed, in order to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate upon what was to be done; they were, likewiſe to do the ſame, if there was an invaſion: and what invaſion is to be feared at this time, I leave to the judgment of every one who hears me. Alſo, in caſe of the landing of foreign troops, for the ſupport of the government of the country, that was to be the cauſe of the ſudden meeting of this Convention: Alſo, if the Habeas Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Act was repealed: And laſtly, if any interruption was
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:027594_0161_0FD54E2FA075E7F0"/>
given to their meetings this Convention of Emergency was to ſit. What concluſion can be drawn from ſuch language; but that they meant to ſubvert the Conſtitution of the country; that it was meant to be carried on in a ſtyle of defiance and oppoſition to the legiſlative authority of this country? therefore, it is in vain for any perſon, pretending to know any thing of the Law of Scotland, to ſay this is merely leaſing making. I ſhall only ſay, that it would have been difficult, if it had not been for the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſtatute law, to know whether it would not have amounted to the crime of high treaſon. My Lords, the Jury have found this man guilty: he is an Engliſhman. I am ſorry that any of that country ſhould ever have interfered in the peace and tranquility, either of their own country, or of this which is a part of the united Kingdoms; but I think we cannot pronounce a leſs ſentence, in this caſe, than in the former caſes; and if any difference is to be made, I do not think it is in favour of this Defendant, who, in his own country, might have lived peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and quietly. My Lords, there can be no ſort of doubt with regard to the powers of the Court: By the laws of this country, before the Act of 1708, Baniſhment from the realm of Scotland was one thing, and Baniſhment to a place beyond the ſeas was another; and theſe were as well known at that time as at this. But, my Lords, is it proper that a perſon from England being found guilty of attempts to ſubvert the Conſtitution; is it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable that we ſhould return him to England, in order that he may continue his practices there, if ſo inclined? If we were not able to do more, we could not help it; but, I ſay, the power of baniſhment, by tranſportation, has been long recognized in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, as well as in England. The Court can do no leſs, than make uſe of the power which the law gives them, to ſend him to a place where he can do no harm. My Lords, if I had any doubt about it, your judgment in the caſe of Mr. Muir, where I was not preſent, but where the other Judges uniformly gave their opinion, that this mode of baniſhment, by tranſportation, was the proper puniſhment for ſuch an offence; that would be ſufficient for me to concur in the ſame opinion. If that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was not too much for Skirving, the Secretary to this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, who appears to be a ſimple deluded man, it cannot be too much for this gentleman, who is, ſo far as I can judge, a man of abilities, of conſiderable knowledge, and one who took the lead in this Convention; and therefore, I concur in the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment mentioned by your Lordſhip.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Swinton.</speaker>
               <p> My Lords, I have no difficulty in concurring with your Lordſhips in the puniſhment you have ſuggeſted; and, after what has been ſaid by your Lordſhips, I ſhall only take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of a very few things; My Lords, the crime of ſedition is worſe in one reſpect than moſt other crimes: many other crimes are committed from the ſudden impulſe of paſſion, or heat; but this crime is committed with a premeditated, felonious intention,
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:027594_0162_0FD54E31261E25F0"/>
by deliberating upon the means of overturning our Conſtitution. They begin with ſeditious and inflammatory diſcourſes, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to draw ſimple, and perhaps well meaning, people after them, by pointing out imperfections which will be in every go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment whatever, and placing them in a ſtrong light; and, in the next place, by ſeditious writings. My Lords, in this caſe the delegates meet, and they appoint a Convention of Emergency; and what are theſe Conventions of Emergency? firſt of all, for the purpoſe of over-awing Parliament; and one of their reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions is, to pay no regard to ſuch an act of Parliament if it ſhould paſs: that is, they deſpiſe the legiſlative authority of the country. Then, in the caſe of an invaſion, and it is eaſy to ſee what ſort of an invaſion was meant. I decline going through all the other particulars of this libel, which is found to be a true li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel in every point. My Lords, what have they pretended? They have pretended a reformation in the Conſtitution. I ſay, my Lords, there is no need for it; our Conſtitution reforms it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. With regard to trial by Jury, which is the palladium, in my memory three acts have been brought in for reforming this point: one lately, giving Juries a power to decide upon the whole matter, in caſe of libel; and we have no need of ſuch Reformers as theſe.</p>
               <p>My Lords, if there is any difference between this caſe and that of others, the crime of this man is highly aggravated: he is not of this country; he does not feel any hardſhips from the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this country; he comes from England, for ſeditious purpoſes, as ſtated in this Indictment; and therefore, if there is any diſtinction in this caſe, it is unfavourable to this Pannel. I am of opinion, with your Lordſhips, that tranſportation for fourteen years is the proper puniſhment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Dunſinnan.</speaker>
               <p> My Lords, after the moſt patient hearing of this caſe, by a Jury, they have come to that determination which ſenſible, honeſt men alone could come to: namely, finding this Pannel guilty. There is no doubt but he has been ſent into this country, in order to diſſeminate ſedition; and, it is evident, that he was very ſedulous in the execution of that office. The Jury, having found a verdict of guilty, it comes to the Court to conſider what puniſhment this crime deſerves; and, my Lords, though it is not pleaſant to paſs judgment upon a fellow ſubject, crimes, dangerous as theſe, cannot be overlooked. My Lords, I am of opinion that this man's guilt is aggravated beyond that of others, who have been in the ſame circumſtances; and that tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation for fourteen years is the proper puniſhment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Abercrombie.</speaker>
               <p> My Lords, it has been juſtly obſerved, that, during the courſe of the trial, the Pannel, now at the bar, met with an uncommon ſhare of indulgence: I believe far beyond what any Court of Juſtice, either in this or any other country, ever afforded a Pannel. My Lords, I don't feel, and never ſhall feel myſelf diſpoſed to ſay one word to load any man, who ſtands
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:027594_0163_0FD54E32A8207DD0"/>
in the unhappy ſituation that he does; but I am ſorry to obſerve, that from the moment he appeared at the bar, till the inſtant he was carried out, his whole conduct was of the moſt indecent kind. My Lords, the crime with which he ſtands charged, and of which he is found guilty, by the unanimous voice of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, upon the moſt ſatisfactory evidence, is that of Sedition, and my Lords, his crime is highly aggravated by one circumſtance, which appeared in the courſe of the trial, that he has been ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up Sedition in this country, and inſtigating ſuch unhappy men, as you ſaw here yeſterday; for example, one of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Britiſh Convention, who was ſo ignorant of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of his own country, that he was obliged to admit, that he never ſo much as read the Claim of Rights. My Lords, is it to ſuch men as theſe that we are to reſort, to get a redreſs of the grievances of this country?</p>
               <p>My Lords, if we are to judge of the means he made uſe of from his ſpeeches in the minutes of the Convention, and the ſpeech which we heard laſt night, ſure I am, that his intention was, to ſtir up a ſpirit of diſaffection and diſcontent among the ignorant and the uninformed; and, my Lords, I conſider the circumſtance of this Pannel being a ſtranger to this country as an aggravation of his crime.</p>
               <p>My Lords, this Society called themſelves originally the friends of the people; they afterwards changed their name, calling themſelves the Britiſh Convention of Delegates, aſſociated to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain univerſal ſuffrage and annual Parliaments; a right which the ſubjects of this country never did enjoy: ſuch a right would tend to bring ruin and deſtruction upon this country. I ſay my Lords, that to this man, they owed that change, and that form which they aſſumed, and of which we have heard ſo much.</p>
               <p>My Lords, I ſhall only add, that the puniſhment propoſed is the mildeſt, which, under all the circumſtances of the caſe, ought to be pronounced.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Juſtice Clerk.</speaker>
               <p> My Lords, after the full diſcuſſion which this crime has undergone, within theſe three months, I ſhall only juſt obſerve, that the crime of which this Pannel is accuſed, and now ſtands convicted by the verdict of a moſt reſpectable Jury of this Country, is Sedition; endeavouring to overturn the eſtabliſhed government of this Country, which is, of all crimes known amongſt mankind, of the moſt heinous nature and the moſt dangerous tendency to Society, and well merits the higheſt arbitrary puniſhment that this Court can poſſibly inflict. You have had two trials before you, one within theſe few months, in which the Pannel was condemned to tranſportation for 14 years, and the other you condemned within theſe few days for the ſame term. The moment I heard the verdict I revolved in my own mind the circumſtances attending this caſe; but it is impoſſible that we can, agreeable to the juſtice of the Country, inflict a leſs puniſhment; the only doubt that occurred to me was, whether
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:027594_0164_0FD54E34229D2908"/>
we ought not to go further; for I did ſee a material difference; this caſe being attended with circumſtances highly aggravated and offenſive to the Laws of this country.</p>
               <p>If this Country ſuffers any grievances, I am ſure he felt none of them: he lives not in Scotland, has no property there, and, as a ſtranger, he comes into this Country a man with a great deal of abilities and great elocution, he comes here for the expreſs purpoſe of diſſeminating Sedition among the lower order of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in this Country. I cannot conſider it as any thing but Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion highly aggravated. I did think that this crime deſerved a more ſevere puniſhment; but I have always more pleaſure in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting a mild puniſhment than a more ſevere one: and as your Lordſhips are all of opinion, that we ſhould inflict the ſame pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment as in the caſe of Skirving and Muir, I concur in the ſame opinion, that he ſhall be tranſported for the term of 14 years, with the uſual certification.</p>

               <p>YOU deſire me to give you my opinion of the preſent ſtate of want and diſtreſs among the weavers in Spitalfields, being Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian to the London Diſpenſary, where between two and 3000 of them annually apply for medical relief, I am called frequently to viſit their wretched habitations, there the firſt thing that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly preſents itſelf to view, is an empty loom, and a ſtarving family. Some have had only half their uſual work, for more than twelvemonths paſt; and many no work at all, for the laſt ſix months. Some times I find one or two children ſick, and the wretched Parents looking upon them with all the diſtreſs which parental affection, and the utmoſt degree of poverty, can impreſs on the mind. At other times, I find the huſband and wife, and not unfrequently both ſick in the ſame bed, and ſeveral helpleſs and half ſtarved children looking up to them for bread. Here anxiety and poverty increaſe the diſeaſe if they did not produce it, which however is often the caſe. It is impoſſible for words to give a perfect idea of the diſtreſs which prevails amongſt this uſeful claſs of the people. If any doubt the truth of this repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, all I can ſay is, come and ſee. Were they to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany me in my daily viſitations for a ſhort time, they would be fully convinced, that this is a very imperfect outline of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral miſery amongſt this part of the labouring poor, who would gladly work, if they could be employed; and therefore the more deſerving of help. I am perſuaded, Sir, that you need only be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with real diſtreſs, to intereſt yourſelf in the means of relieving it in the preſent inſtance. Both you, Sir, and thoſe who ſecond your laudable endeavours and benevolent purpoſes, will be doing a good work. I am,</p>

               <p>In one ſhort month (December 1792) an innovation was made on the ſcheme of Britiſh Society; and, in one eventful year, it has changed the character of the nation, from the happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a people living together like one large family, under common laws; we were broke into ſets, and put under the inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Clubs. Jealouſy and Diſcord ſucceeded confidence and Union; the moſt honourable connections; the moſt ancient friendſhips; the ſocial and endearing intercourſes of neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood; nay, the ties of kindred were rudely, wantonly torn aſunder; and the better to ſecure to us the calamities of a foreign war, we were involved in the more dreadful horrors of internal feud. In the ſhort ſpace that we can allot to this article, it is impoſſible for us to enter into the painful enumeration of the events of 1792. When the faithful hiſtorian comes to record them after paſſion and tremor have ſubſided, it will be found to be the moſt diſaſtrous to conſtitutional liberty, to ſcience, to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and to trade, that England ever knew, ſince the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment if its freedom. What a reverſe from the animating and cheering picture of our proſperity and happineſs, which a libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Correſpondent gave to the public, through the medium of this paper, on this day twelvemonth. The great events of the year have covered with diſtreſs the whole face of the iſland; the ſecret hiſtory of the period we neither fully can nor dare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velope. It is ſufficient to ſay, that acts of perſecution, unknown to Engliſhmen, have been practiſed with applauſe; integrity and friendſhip have been branded as unbecoming an exalted mind; and conſiſtency in principles as unſuitable to the times. Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion has been hunted into the retirement of families, and he who dared to manifeſt his public doctrines, has been aſſaulted on the ſide of his profeſſion in life. The pulpit, the army, the bar, and the preſs, all furniſh the ſhocking evidence that Spaniſh and Italian arts may flouriſh on an Engliſh ſoil.</p>
