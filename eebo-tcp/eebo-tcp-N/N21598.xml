            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>Speech of Mr. Charles Pinckney,</hi> Late Governor of South Carolina, at a very numerous Meeting of the Citizens of Charleſton, the 22d July, <hi>1795,</hi> to hear the Report of their Committee on the Treaty between Great-Britain and the United States of America.

                  <p>HE began by ſaying, that having been abſent in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he was prevented from attending their meeting on the 16th—but, conceiving it the duty of every friend to his country, on an occaſion ſo intereſting to their commercial rights, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>n he ſhould give on the treaty.</p>
                  <p>In doing this, he ſaid he ſhould follow the advice that had juſt been properly given by the Intendant, and be very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate. In diſcuſſions of ſuch importance, moderation appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him eſſential to the diſcovery of truth.</p>
                  <p>It was ſomewhere very well ſaid, that paſſion and intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance never failed to wreſt the ſceptre from reaſon; and he hoped they would not, on this intereſting occaſion, prevent the fair application of argument to the judgment of an aſſembly ſo numerous and reſpectable as that was.</p>
                  <p>In examining the treaty, it appeared to him neceſſary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly to trace the manner in which Mr. Jay, had been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to this truſt, and the inſtructions he had received; in order to determine how far it was conducted, in its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement and progreſs, upon thoſe principles which were conformable to the ſpirit and intention of that article of the conſtitution which reſpects treaties, and to the candor and fairneſs which ought to govern in all negociations where any thing like reciprocity is to be expected, and where there was no determination, on the part of the government, or its ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociator, that unneceſſary and diſhonorable ſacrifices were to be nature.</p>
                  <p>He ſaid that it muſt here be acknowledged, that as Mr. Jay's appointment <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>By referring to the proceedings of the ſenate on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, it appears that the preſident, in a ſhort, unexplanatory meſſage, ſtated to them, that, from the communications of our miniſter in Great Britain, our affairs with that court wore a ſerious aſpect; that before we reſorted to the laſt expedient, which had been the ſcourge of ſo many nations, he thought negociation preferable, and nominated Mr. Jay as envoy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary on that occaſion. He ſaid, his confidence in our miniſter reſident there remained undiminiſhed; but he ſtill was of opinion, the meaſure was neceſſary; that ſuch an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy, going from among us at this time, would have fuller information of the ſtate of things, and carry with him more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually the ſenſibility and feelings of the people.</p>
                  <p>On this meſſage being ſent to the ſenate, it was very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſuppoſed, by ſome of the members of that body, that the preſident ought to have ſubmitted to them the whole of the buſineſs upon which Mr. Jay was to have been ſent; and a motion to that effect was brought forward, but negatived. Mr. Jay's appointment was conſented to; and, as far as he underſtood to be the fact, he was abſolutely ſent to negociate a treaty with Great Britain, without his inſtructions being ſubmitted to the ſenate, or that body being acquainted with the preſident's intention to enter into a negociation, which was ultimately to lead to the formation of a treaty of ſuch immenſe conſequence to every part of the union. He had been inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he believed his information was correct, that many of the members of the ſenate at that time were of opinion, Mr. Jay was ſent for the purpoſe of obtaining compenſation for the depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations in the Weſt Indies; to demand the delivery of the poſts, and the execution of the treaty of peace; and to require a ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028389_0006_0FD8E6AF441F9678"/>that our veſſels ſhould not in future be liable to ſeizure or condemnation on any pretence. He was ſure that this was the general opinion of the people in this part of the union; and, as he had obſerved, he underſtood it to be the opinion of the ſenate.</p>
                  <p>If this is the fact, that Mr. Jay's inſtructions for forming this treaty were not ſubmitted to the ſenate, nor received their aſſent, he conſidered it as a matter of great importance indeed, and that required the moſt ſerious attention of the people, how far the conſtitution ever intended to authorize the preſident to enter into any negociation with a foreign power, without his having firſt ſubmitted his intentions and inſtructions to the ſenate and received their advice and aſſent, as well with reſpect to the neceſſity of ſuch negociation, as to the propriety of his inſtructions.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Pinckney ſaid, his opinion clearly was, that the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution gave no power to the preſident to commence a negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without previouſly ſubmitting his intentions and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the ſenate, requiring their advice and receiving their aſſent. The words "by and with the advice and conſent of the ſenate" admit no other explanation. He cannot be ſaid to adviſe with them upon a meaſure, if he forms a treaty without their knowledge, and merely leaves to them the power of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining whether they will ratify it or not, after it has been ſolemnly concluded by the miniſter.</p>
                  <p>The true conſtruction of this article, and the uſe the people of the union will one day require to be made of it, is, if the preſident thought a foreign negociation neceſſary, that he ſhould previouſly conſult the ſenate, and be governed by their opinion, how far it would be proper, and upon what conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to proceed in it; and that if the ſenate, without the previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous interference of the preſident, thought a negociation proper, that they ſhould adviſe it, and that the preſident ſhould enter upon it. Although a contrary uſe had hitherto been made of this power, yet Mr. Pinckney ſaid, that it well deſerved the attention of the public, whether any other conſtruction ought to be admitted; and that if a different uſe had been made of it, or if the article was doubtful, or open to any other mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whether it was not of greater conſequence than any thing that had been agitated ſince the revolution, that theſe doubts ſhould be removed, and the meaning he contended for, une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocally given to the article. If, on the other hand, a power was to be given to the preſident to enter into negociations with foreigners, without acquainting the ſenate with their nature, or the connections he wiſhes to form, and be ſhould merely
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028389_0007_0FD8E6B15B8CB430"/>leave to them the power of ratifying or not, it muſt at once be ſeen, that the agency, which the conſtitution intended to give the ſenate, in the formation of treaties, was in a great meaſure deſtroyed; and that as it was an unuſual, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a hazardous thing, and productive of war, or other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional calamities, for nations to refuſe to ratify a treaty after it had been ſigned by the miniſter, who, it is to be ſuppoſed, was properly inſtructed, and acted agreeably to the inſtructions and wiſhes of thoſe who ſent him, there could be no doubt of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper treaties being FORCED upon the people.</p>
                  <p>If the ſenate were not to have a right to adviſe the preſident to a negociation, which they conſidered as proper, without his previous interference—if no foreign connection was to take place but of his propoſing—it then indeed became an enquiry of the higheſt importance, how far the people or the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the United States ever intended to place all its foreign connections, all the treaties they may think neceſſary to their peace and ſecurity, to their general intereſts, or the regulation of their commerce, in the hands of one man: a man in whom, by giving him the right to nominate, they had already placed all the honors and offices of the government; and to which unexampled power in any thing that had even the appearance of a free government, an attempt, was here made to add the all-important one of concluding treaties without the knowledge of the ſenate, and leaving it to them merely to ratify: a power which, under an unwiſe uſe of it, may involve us in wars, abridge our rights, and would, as he ſhould attempt to ſhew, by ſuch treaties as Mr. Jay's, eventually deſtroy our navingation and commerce, and the right congreſs had to regulate them.</p>
                  <p>He would, upon a proper occaſion, enter more largely into theſe ſubjects; he had at preſent mentioned them with a view to prove the neceſſity of the people's ſeriouſly attending to a treaty, in the commencement of which there have been two breaches of the conſtitution, and which, from the manner of its negociation, muſt neceſſarily bring before the public a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of the important ſubjects which on this occaſion he had only time very ſlightly to touch upon.</p>
                  <p>If, however, a treaty was conſidered as indiſpenſible, and our trade was in ſo languid a ſtate that it could not be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageouſly carried on without the ſupport of, or a connection with Great Britain, ſurely Mr. Jay was of all men the moſt improper that could have been appointed; the moſt unlikely to obtain thoſe advantages which the humbled and diſtreſſed ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that country gave us a right to expect,—nay, to demand; and without which it is the univerſal opinion of all the real
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028389_0008_0FD8E6B558C01EE0"/>friends of their country, it was diſhonorable, not to ſay trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous, to have entered into any treaty with them.—His diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to the French—his partiality for Britiſh government and meaſure—h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ns as ſecretary, and afterwards as judge, in favor of their claims, were well known. On theſe points the Engliſh miniſter was ſure of his acquieſcence in every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. If he had attempted to ſay a word in favor of the claims, or even of allowances to his countrymen, his opponent had only to ſhow him his own opinions, and his lips muſt have been inſtantly cloſed.</p>
                  <p>They could not but recollect his conduct, in the attempt be made in 1785, to barter away the rights of his country, in ſacrificing the intereſts, and of courſe diſſevering the weſtern territory from the union, by ceding to Spain, for twenty-five years, the right to navigate the Miſſiſſippi, for which we were to receive a treaty that would not give a ſingle benefit we did not before poſſeſs, and which it muſt always be her intereſt to allow. Standing, therefore, in this ſituation as a public man, he was ſo devoted to the intereſts of the Britiſh, and his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in favor of that country were ſo well known, that it was impoſſible for us, through ſuch a negociator, to form any but a treaty deſtructive to our commercial rights, ungrateful and injurious to our allies, and conſequently degrading to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional character. However, good may ſometimes ariſe our of evil. If he had not made this public expoſure of his conduct and principles, he might one day have been brought forward, among others, as a candidate for our higheſt office.—But the general and deſerved contempt which his negociations have brought both his talents and principles into, will, he truſted, for ever ſecure his fellow citizens from the dangerous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe uſe which ſuch a man would have made of the important powers veſted in a preſident.</p>
                  <p>How far, under theſe circumſcances, and many of them muſt have been known to him, it may have been prudent in the preſident to ſend a man who has ſhown himſelf ſo unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the commercial intereſts of his country, and ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably deficient in thoſe talents which a negociator required— to oppoſe him ſingly, and at their own court, to the talents, experience, and perhaps temptations of their ableſt ſtateſmen,— is one of thoſe extraordinary occurrences in his conduct, which, conſidering the character, general good ſenſe, and unſhaken integrity of the preſident, is difficult to be accounted for.</p>
                  <p>Such was the negociator; and ſuch were the circumſtances under which this treaty has been produced.</p>

I am now, he ſaid, to examine the treaty,—but as the report of the committee has juſt been read, it would be unneceſſary, and occupy more of your time than you could ſpare, to enter into a particular diſcuſſion of every article; all that can be expected, at preſent, is to review its leading features, and ſtate how far they miſſtate againſt the true intereſts of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.</p>

Although he knew it would operate to the ruin almoſt entirely of that claſs which have been the greateſt ſufferers by the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, be meant the former merchants of America, ſuch has been his conſtant and unremitted attention to the ſupport of the Britiſh claims, that, as ſecretary for foreign affairs, as judge, and now as envoy, he has unceaſingly and with marked induſtry and perſeverance upon all occaſions ſupported them, againſt the intereſts of his fellow citizens, the feelings of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and the honor and gratitude of his country. It alſo creates a mode of adjudication unuſual and unknown to the laws of this country; and leaves it to be determined by chance, whether the majority of the commiſſioners to be appointed may not be Britiſh ſubjects, and load our funds, at pleaſure, with a very heavy debt.</p>
                  <p>The next point reſpects the depredations on our commerce in the Weſt Indies, and the compenſation it propoſes. This was the ſubject which gave riſe to Mr. Jay's miſſion; for, he ſaid, he believed that had no depredations exiſted, no ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment would have been made.—How far he has ſucceeded in his attempt to obtain compenſation, or whether the mode he has adopted, will prove effectual, time alone can diſcover; at preſent it appears to be very doubtful, and to depend entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon chance. Each party are to appoint two commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, whoſe opinions will be previouſly well known, and who will carry with them into their adjudications all the paſſions and prejudices of thoſe who appoint them—it will then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend entirely upon the fifth, who is to be choſen by lot, in whoſe favor the deciſion will be: whereas theſe depredations being notorious breaches of the law of nations, and inſulting infringements of our neutrality, the demand ſhould have been ſpirited and poſitive, the remedy ſpeedy and complete; no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternative ſhould have been offered; he ſhould have required immediate ſatisfaction; if they had refuſed, he ſhould have quitted their court, and left it to his country to have determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what other meaſures were neceſſary to purſue. But, inſtead of this, he has accepted a remote, expenſive, and uncertain remedy; and, in return for their refuſal of juſtice, in the moſt condeſcending manner has ſtipulated that all prizes brought in by our allies, and which are ſaid to have been captured by privateers illegally equipped, or taken within our limits, ſhall be paid for upon certain and fixed principles.</p>
                  <p>As to the 12th article, which the ſenate have rejected, there appears but one ſentiment throughout the union; there can be but one in the beaſt of every man of ſerfs, ſpirit or honeſt
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028389_0011_0FD8E6BCCFA11940"/>in every part of the world; that it is an infamous and degrad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſurrender of the rights and character of this country, and a mean and ungenerous deſertion of the intereſt of our friends, the French, to whoſe ſupplies, at leaſt in the articles they conſider as of neceſſity in their preſent noble and unexampled ſtruggle for freedom, we are bound by every tie of gratitude and honor to attend. To examine this article fully, ſtate its inequalities, the reſtrictions it impoſes, and the evils that muſt ariſe from it, are not within the limits of theſe obſervations; nor is it neceſſary, from the general deteſtation in which it is hold by foreigners as well as citizens. That for the paltry al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of being permitted to ſend veſſels of 70 tons to the Britiſh Weſt Indies, we are to give up the right to export Weſt India produce, and even the cotton of American growth, to Europe, in our own veſſels, is ſuch a glaring and inſolent attempt to abridge our rights and gratify the wiſhes of the Britiſh nation in checking our commerce, that, inſtead of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying with him the feelings and ſenſibility of his countrymen, which were certainly ſufficiently awake to the conduct of Great Britain, he muſt have entirely forgot their temper and firmneſs; he could not have remembered, that, however mild and obedient they generally were to laws founded in equality and a regard to their rights, yet that they loved their country, were attentive to its intereſts, and impatient of any inſult on its government; and that ſooner than ſubmit to ſuch ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious ſhackles as thoſe he had attempted to impoſe, however they might wiſh upon all honorable occaſions to avoid them, they would rather riſk the dangers and inconveniencies of a war.</p>
                  <p>He has, however, endeavoured immediately to follow this ſubmiſſive and diſhonourable article with one which he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, by having the appearance of a favor, will in ſome meaſure atone for its diſgraceful conceſſions; this is the one which reſpects the trade with their Eaſt India ſettlements.

<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028389_0013_0FD8E6C35EDFDAB8"/>with its rights. Our Mediterranean trade would likewiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecured, and the advantages which would ſoon accrue to our citizens from having their commerce protected, as well in time of war as peace, would, in a few years, amply repay the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes of the equipment.</p>
                  <p>Among the many improper parts of the treaty, he conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this as the moſt important, and the moſt ſeriouſly injurious to our commerce: and while they continued to inſiſt upon the right to ſearch and detain our veſſels, if there had been no other objection, Mr. Jay ſhould have refuſed to ſign the treaty.</p>
                  <p>As to the 15th, which is a very important article of the treaty, he had endeavoured upon that to obtain the beſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantile information he could; the reſult is this:—</p>
                  <p>The firſt clauſe places the veſſels of America on the ſame footing with thoſe of other foreign nations. This perhaps is as much as we could expect, conſiſtent with their obligations to other nations; but it ought to be underſtood, that by this rule, American veſſels going to their European ports, pay from 15 to 20 <abbr>l.</abbr> on a veſſel of 150 to 200 tons, more than a Britiſh veſſel. To counteract this well became the government of this country; accordingly, the firſt congreſs under the new conſtitution, impoſed a duty on the tonnage of all foreign ſhips, of 25 cents per ton.</p>
                  <p>The duty impoſed on American ſhips in England was under the denomination of <hi>double light money,</hi> &amp;c. and the debates in congreſs ſhow the object of laying the 25 cents per ton, to be what is here mentioned. The next ſeſſion of Congreſs, it being diſcovered that Great Britain had no inclination to treat with us on ſubjects of commerce,<note n="†" place="bottom">See the preſident's meſſage, February <hi>14, 1790.</hi>
                     </note> a further duty was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on foreign tonnage, equal in the whole to 50 cents per ton. It was at the ſame time diſcovered, that American ſhips were fully adequate to the carrying all the foreign goods, Weſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, European, and Aſiatic, neceſſary to the conſumption of the country: Congreſs, therefore, paſſed a law, that on all fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign goods, imported in American ſhips from Europe or the Weſt Indies, there ſhould be a deduction of ten per cent on the amount of duties preſcribed by law. They have ſince made the goods imported in American ſhips pay the whole duty, and foreign ſhips ten per cent. in addition.</p>
                  <p>It being clearly aſcertained, that America could carry on its own India trade, the difference of duty on foreign ſhips, was
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028389_0014_0FD8E6C4D8438858"/>in all India commodities as fifteen to ten, making, in effect, a total prohibition againſt foreigners in this trade.</p>
                  <p>Under theſe diſcriminating regulations, American commerce and navigation flouriſhed beyond all former example, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to exceed belief. Any one, of common obſervation, may remark the difference in this town. By whoſe capital and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, and under what flag, was the commerce of Charleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton carried on, prior to 1789? At that time, there was hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an American houſe in extenſive trade; and there were not ſix ſhips under the American flag trading out of Charleſton: now American merchants carry on all the trade, and they own more than ſixty veſſels of large ſize, and a much greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of ſmaller veſſels in the Weſt India trade.</p>
                  <p>Our fellow citizens at the northward too, have had exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively the India trade, by which, beſides ſupplying our own citizens with Aſiatic goods at one fourth the price they were before the revolution, they have exported them to the Weſt Indies, and even to Europe, making thereby the balance of trade more favorable to the United States. Theſe reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, favorable to American navigation and commerce, did not produce from any European power counter reſtrictions. The privy council of Great Britain charged a committee of lords, on the ſubject of trade, generally to report their opinion on theſe meaſures: they took the advice of merchants in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of London, Briſtol, Liverpool, and Glaſgow, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult was, that in their opinion the trade with America was ſo important, that it ought not to be hazarded by harſh meaſures, and they recommended an acquieſcence in the preſent reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, rather than to endeavour a removal of them by retalia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus, then, the matter ſtood when Mr. Jay arrived in England; except that, owing to a contingency, America had ſo increaſed her navigation as, beyond all diſpute, to be fully adequate to the carrying of the produce of the United States.</p>
                  <p>At this moment Mr. Jay concedes, in the ſecond ſection of the 15th article, "But the Britiſh government reſerves to itſelf the right of impoſing on American veſſels entering into the Britiſh ports in Europe, a tonnage duty equal to that which ſhall be payable by Britiſh veſſels in the ports of America, and alſo ſuch duty as may be adequate to countervail the difference of duty now payable on the importation of European and ASIATIC goods, when imported into the United States, in Britiſh or American veſſels."</p>
                  <p>In the laſt part of the 3d ſection of the ſame article it ſays, "It is agreed that the United States will not impoſe any new or additional tonnage duty on Britiſh veſſels, nor increaſe the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028389_0015_0FD8E6C6569860C8"/>now ſubſiſting difference between the duties payable on the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of any articles in Britiſh or American veſſels." The operation of this article will be, that as Britiſh goods are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſhipped to America on credit, the condition of the credit will be, that then our (Britiſh) ſhips ſhall have the freight; and it is not an extravagant idea to preſume, that the wealth of the Britiſh Eaſt India Company may be employed to cruſh the American merchants now in this trade, that they afterwards may enjoy the monopoly of it.</p>
                  <p>By treaties now exiſting with other nations, they are to be uſed, "as the moſt favored;" and having of right the ſame privileges of counteracting theſe diſcriminating duties, they will of courſe exerciſe it. The extent of theſe injurious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences need not be predicted to an intelligent man; every one, even of the meaneſt capacity, muſt ſee in them the ſpeedy and total deſtruction of American navigation, and of courſe our independent commerce.</p>
                  <p>There are other parts of the treaty, by which a number of articles are declared to be contraband, that we never conſented to conſider as ſuch in any other treaties; and attempts are made to make even proviſions come under this deſcription.</p>
                  <p>By theſe means almoſt every article of exportation is declared contraband; and whenever there is a war between the maritime powers, the danger of ſeizure and condemnation to us will be as great as if we were actually at war ourſelves.</p>
                  <p>He ſaid he would only add, that the 23d, 24th, and 25th articles ſeem to carry with them very ſtrongly the ſpirit of the 12th. In them the negociator has endeavoured to render this country as unfriendly as he could to the French, to deſtroy the tranquillity and order of our ſea-ports, and to brand our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils with ingratitude. In them he has diſplayed all his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the only truly uſeful and valuable ally we have ever had—a nation which wiſhes to treat with us upon the equality which ought, and indeed muſt be the baſis of every laſting treaty; for without equality few treaties can laſt.</p>
                  <p>Vattel, whoſe authority will not be doubted, ſays, that "Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not being leſs obliged than individuals to have a regard to equity, they ought, as much as poſſible, to preſerve equality in their treaties. When, therefore, the parties are in ſuch a ſtate as to obtain the ſame reciprocal advantages, the law of nature requireth their treaties ſhould be equal, at leaſt if there is not ſome particular reaſon to deviate from that equality; ſuch, for inſtance, would be gratitude for a former benefit, in the hope of becoming unavoidably attached to a nation."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="unknown:028389_0016_0FD8E6C874D30688"/>
This is the language of the law of nations on the ſubject of the equality of treaties; and comparing the ſituation of the two countries, at preſent, it will not be ſaid we were not in a ſtate to obtain reciprocal advantages. We were certainly not bound, by gratitude for former benefits, to make ſacrifices in their favor; nor has it ever appeared to be the diſpoſition of our citizens to be ſo inviolably attached to Great Britain, as to grant them favors which they have never yielded to the more friendly powers of Europe, nor even to thoſe to whom they are highly indebted for the eſtabliſhment of their freedom. There muſt then be ſome other reaſons for thoſe uncommon ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, upon which the public are not yet ſufficiently informed.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the outlines of the treaty on which you are to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide. The ſhortneſs of the time allowed for deliberations, and the neceſſity of diſpatch, prevented, he ſaid, his going as fully into its conſequences as he would wiſh, or as he may hereafter do, ſhould it ever come before our legiſlature. Indeed it is much to be lamented, that the legiſlatures of the different ſtates were not in ſeſſion at this important time, as the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the people, expreſſed through them, would come with more weight. But the preſident, to whom the addreſs is to be made, will recollect, that by his poſtponing the conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the treaty from January to June, when none of the ſtate legiſlatures were in ſeſſion, the people have been forced to expreſs their ſentiments in this way, or to be ſilent on a ſubject which has been ſhown to be of the greateſt conſequence, and to now reſt entirely with him. How awful muſt he feel his ſituation! The character, honor, and future commercial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of his country, depending entirely on his determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If he refuſes the treaty, he will be for ever entitled to the thanks and gratitude of his country, for having again ſaved it from the attempts of an experienced and ambitious rival. If he ratifies it, ſuch will ever be the love of his country for his paſt ſervices, they will always lament that a name, which has hitherto been ſo diſtinguiſhed, ſhould, at the cloſe of its career, be voluntarily fixed to ſo injurious and degrading a meaſure.</p>
                  <p>As this is the firſt attempt which has been made by an une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual and improper treaty, to abridge our rights, and controul the power of congreſs in regulating our commerce, it becomes the duty of the friends of their country to expreſs their ſentiments, and to endeavor by every legal means to oppoſe its conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, by ſtating its defects, and preventing, if poſſible, its adoption.—We ſhould recollect, that treaties, when ratified; have higher authority than laws, becauſe they are declared to be the ſupreme law of the land, and are irrevocable but by the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028389_0017_0FD8E6C963A9F588"/>conſent of all the parties to them. That, however deſtructive or injurious they may prove to be in their operation, they are without the ſphere of legiſlative redreſs or interference: that while the right of regulating commerce remains unimpaired in both houſes of congreſs, there can be no doubt of its being properly uſed. This the unexampled increaſe of our commerce for ſome years, clearly proves, and ſhows the impropriety of fettering it by treaties. Our policy was to have purſued the ſame meaſures; and in all caſes where any nation invaded our rights and refuſed to do us juſtice, to have endeavored by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions, or, if neceſſary, retaliations, to obtain them.</p>
                  <p>But if, inſtead of leaving the regulation of commerce to congreſs, from whoſe uſe of it ſo many benefits have ariſen, there ſhould appear a diſpoſition to interfere, by the means of treaties, which may hereafter operate to leſſen our ſhipping, place us more in the power of foreigners, and deſtroy that competition which is ſo neceſſary to our obtaining a proper price for our ſtaples; to all the ſtates, particularly to thoſe which are agricultural, it becomes a matter of the moſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous concern. To no ſtate can it be more ſo, than to South Carolina. We are entirely agricultural; and while our commerce is unfettered, and the preſent competition for our productions encouraged and protected by law—while we are ſure of having American ſhipping in ſufficient numbers to ſupport our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial rights—our planters will grow rich, the trade of our merchants become every day more extenſive and reſpectable, and our country will be happy. But let it be once known, that, by the interference of an unfortunate and ruinous treaty, a foundation is laid for the diminution of our ſhipping; that we are not to enjoy the rights of neutrality or an independent commerce; that our veſſels are to be liable to ſeizure, and we are again to look to other nations for the means of tranſportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it will at once damp the hopes of our planters and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and injure the value of their eſtates, check their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing views, and leſſen the general happineſs. In all enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened countries, ſome portion of the happineſs of the inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants muſt depend upon the eaſe with which they can acquire property, and the protection which their government is able to afford it. It is the general purſuit of mankind; and few peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple can be happy in any country, which either does not or cannot protect them, abroad as well as at home, in their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges and property. The experience of the laſt ſix years has clearly proved that we poſſeſs the means of national happineſs and proſperity within ourſelves; and it will depend upon the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028389_0018_0FD8E6CF9754FA08"/>event of this treaty how far we are to cheriſh or part with them.</p>
                  <p>He ſaid his opinion always had been, that <hi>countries poſſeſſing within themſelves the means of a growing and extenſive commerce, particularly where they conſiſted of articles of the firſt neceſſity, ſuch as proviſions and raw materials neceſſary to the ſupport and manufact<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>res of other nations, ought not, except in very particular caſes, to form treaties of commerce. A nation with theſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages always may, by proper laws and reſtrictions, render its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce more advantageous to its own citizens than foreigners.</hi> By being unfettered with treaties, it continually has it in its power to avail itſelf of any advantage the imprudence or ſituation of other countries may offer; and to always keep the ſtaff of its commerce in its own hands. It is the opinion of thoſe who are beſt informed on this ſubject, and in which every enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened man muſt concur, that thus ſituated, commerce, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conventions which regard the law of nations, ought not to be the object of negociation.—That every power, in this regard, ſhould depend only on itſelf. After having made ſuch regulations as it judges beſt, calculated for its ſituation, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of its riches and the induſtry of its inhabitants, let it, like England, have courage and conſtancy enough never to derogate from them in favor of ſtrangers: all its policy ſhould conſiſt in a reſolution never to think of forming treaties of commerce, until it finds itſelf in ſome happy circumſtance, which may au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſe it to demand prerogatives of foreign powers, without pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing them even with equivalents.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are principles which apply to all countries in ſimilar ſituations; but to none more forcibly than to our own, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly as it reſpects Great Britain.</p>
                  <p>Our commerce, as has been confeſſed by their committee of trade, is of the higheſt importance to Britain. From her Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean dominions we take her manufactures, and in return ſend her proviſions and raw materials. The balance, which is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally againſt us, we pay in ſpecie. So lucrative and import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant muſt this commerce be to her, that it certainly will always be her intereſt to continue and extend it without a treaty. From her Weſt India iſlands, we receive what it is always in our power to obtain from the iſlands of the other powers; but in time of ſearcity, which frequently occurs, they are unable to obtain proviſions and lumber but from America. They are therefore more dependent on us than we are upon them, and our ſituation will ſoon force from them a much more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous trade than the treaty propoſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="unknown:028389_0019_0FD8E6D24C963AA0"/>
Upon the whole of this buſineſs, it will be found that the treaty deſerves the cenſure of every friend to his country, and every man elſe, who wiſhes to ſee its commerce extenſive and flouriſhing. Even the moſt partial of Mr. Jay's friends confeſs it is a bad treaty, and they do not wiſh it ratified; but only contend that it is not juſt ſo infamous as it is generally ſuppoſed to be—But it may here be aſked, has he accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſingle object for which he was ſent? Has he obtained complete ſatisfaction for the depredations in the Weſt Indies, the delivering of the poſts, compenſation for their detention, and payment for the negroes carried away? Have they, in ſhort, agreed to do any thing towards executing the treaty of peace, without receiving from us in return a ſurrender of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant commercial rights? Inſtead of ſtipulating to make our commerce free, as other nations have done, to whom it is by no means ſo beneficial, they have expreſsly reſerved to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the right of ſearching and carrying off veſſels into then ports; while in return, we have granted them every thing they aſked, and more than they could have expected, even if they had given us an advantageous treaty.</p>
                  <p>From what could this extraordinary ſurrender of our rights have ſprung? Was it from ignorance? Was it from deſign? For the honor of our public councils he hoped not from the latter. Some of his friends have ſuppoſed it to ariſe from a want of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect knowledge of our exports—That he did not know that in the United States cotton grew, or that they were ever in the habit of exporting Weſt India produce to Europe. From whatever cauſe it may have ariſen, he was ſure it could not be conformable to his inſtructions. The preſident was too well acquainted with the intereſts of his country; he muſt have recollected that her dignity and his own character were too intimately connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: that he could not ſacrifice the one without tarniſhing the other. He certainly could never have given ſuch inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. We know we can truſt him; and he wiſhed that the event had proved that we could have truſted Mr. Jay as well.</p>
                  <p>He concluded with declaring his opinion of the treaty to be, that it was injurious to the commercial rights, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grading to the character of his country; ungrateful to our allies; and that it was our duty by a reſpectful, but forcible addreſs, to ſtate our opinion, and requeſt the preſident not to ratify it.</p>

                  <p>THE magnitude of the preſent ſubject, and the danger of the preſent criſis, render this meeting peculiarly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. We are called upon to examine a treaty, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves the moſt precious rights, the moſt valuable intereſts, the commerce, the peace, and the honor of America. A conciſe hiſtorical detail will unfold the peculiar circumſtances in which America ſtood prior to the embaſſy which produced this treaty. The king of Great Britain, who has ſworn eternal enmity to republics, acceded at an early period to that combination, which has convulſed Europe, in attempting to ſtifle the liberty of France. Under the obnoxious pretext of attempting to ſtarve thirty millions of men, he iſſued orders for intercepting the correſpondence, and plundering the commerce of neutral nations. He had long viewed with indignant ſorrow, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid progreſs which the Americans made, in ſpite of all the obſtacles he could impoſe by commercial reſtrictions, or by flagrant violations of the treaty of 1783. The deſtruction of our riſing commerce, the annihilation of our growing naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were the objects contemplated by theſe nefarious orders. They were executed with all the diligence, and all the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which rapacity can practice. A patriotic phalanx in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs propoſed every expedient which wiſdom could dictate, to obtain compenſation for theſe injuries: but our illuſtrious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, animated by paternal ſolicitude for the welfare of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, gently inſinuated to congreſs, that the ſubject was out of their juriſdiction, and appointed our chief juſtice to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the honorable duty of declaring the indignation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the rights of an injured people. If ſtern ariſtocracy had not ſteeled his boſom againſt the generous ſenſations of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm—if gratitude, ſenſibility, and honor, had not been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veloped in the ſable gloom of political prejudice, he muſt have been animated by a magnanimity worthy of his country. In the preſence of venal pride and courtly profligacy, even at the footſtool of the throne, he would have preſerved the atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of dignity, and ſpoken the language of truth. But baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apoſtatizing from republican principles, he ſtooped to offer the incenſe of flattery to a tyrant, the ſcourge of his country, the foe of mankind. After a long negociation, in which he
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:028389_0021_0FD8E6DBB6BFCAF8"/>happily practiſed the arts of diplomatic flattery, he has preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this treaty to his expecting country. It has received, in every article but one, the ſanction of the ſenate. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of that aſſembly has, indeed, been uniform. Since the eſtabliſhment of the federal government, it has never deigned to adopt the ſentiments of the people, or to communicate in own, except in the dignified form of laws and treaties. The majeſty of that aſſembly has never been polluted by the vile feet of the <hi>ſwiniſh</hi> multitude. The exiſtence of an ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in this country is too often regarded as the chimera of ſome diſtempered enthuſiaſt, or the fiction of ſome dangerous dem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The objections I ſhall make to it are, firſt, on account of the articles it does not contain; and, ſecondly, on account of the articles it does contain. It ought to have been expreſsly ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, that the king of Great Britain ſhould interpoſe for us his good offices with the piratical ſtates, or at leaſt that he ſhould not negociate a peace between Portugal and Algiers, which ſhould again render thoſe plunderers the tyrants of the ocean. His recent conduct in that quarter had very materially injured us—but no proviſion againſt a repetition of it, has been made by our miniſter. By the French treaty, concluded in the year 1778, in the tumultuous moments which attend the criſis of liberty, by a government ſo much deſpiſed for imbecility, this protection from Algerine corſairs, was expreſsly given by a king, from whom we had nothing to demand, and every thing to ſue, and to whom we granted privileges much leſs important, than thoſe we now grant.</p>
                  <p>A ſtipulation ought to have been inſiſted on for ample com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for the detention of the weſtern poſts—a detention which has defrauded America of the immenſe profits of the fur trade, and which has produced a long, bloody, and diſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Indian war.</p>
                  <p>A ſtipulation ought to have been made that Britiſh ſhips of war ſhould protect American ſhips at ſea. Although the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eles relative to armed ſhips appear to be mutual; yet, ſince we have no armed ſhips, we receive no conſideration for the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges we grant theirs. Here another advantage is given to us by the French treaty, which this denies.</p>
                  <p>As I have been forced to anticipate the compariſon between the two treaties, I will now continue it, and then ſtate my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections to the articles contained in the treaty. The French are by treaty to pay no higher duties than the moſt favored nations pay. In the year 1778, we refuſed to admit even thoſe generous allies into our ports upon the ſame terms with citizens. By this treaty the Britiſh are to be admitted on the ſame terms with American merchants. But the French, the Dutch, and the Spaniards, are entitled to pay no higher duties than the moſt favored nations. If this treaty is ratified, they will be obliged to pay no higher duties than American merchants. This treaty then almoſt annihilates the diſtinction between fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners and natives; which we refuſed to relinquiſh in favor of our allies and protectors in the epoch of danger and infancy —Let this prove with what abject humility we proſtrate before the Britiſh king.</p>
                  <p>By the 2d article of the French treaty, it is provided, that enemies' property ſhall not be taken out of American veſſels—
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:028389_0023_0FD8E6E1517A1730"/>the French cannot take out of American veſſels Britiſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. By this treaty it is provided, that enemies' property may be taken out of American veſſels. The Britiſh may take out of American veſſels French property. The object of this arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle was, to give the ſanction of America to thoſe atrocious robberies, which have wreſted from the wretched Weſt Indian exile, the laſt pittance of deſpairing poverty. By the French treaty, the carrying trade of enemies' property, not only from neutral ports to enemies' ports, but from enemies' ports to ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies' ports, is given us—By this treaty, that valuable ſource of wealth is denied us. By the French treaty it is declared that they ſhall not intercept American veſſels bound with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions to the ports of their enemies—By this treaty it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that the Britiſh may intercept American veſſels bound with proviſions to the ports of their enemies. The French then cannot intercept American veſſels bound with proviſions to the ports of Great Britain; but the Britiſh can intercept American veſſels bound with proviſions to the ports of the French republic. The object of this article was to render America acceſſary to the nefarious ſcheme of exciting, by the agency of famine, inſurrection and diſorder, which may either exterminate or enſlave the French. The object of this article was to render America a cowardly confederate, concealing, under the venerable form of friendſhip, the vileſt malice. And ſhall this treaty diſſolve the compact made by nature between the two republics, ſecured by ſeelings generous and inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, guaranteed by all the ſoft ſenſibilities of the human heart? Shall this treaty force the Americans, the firſt people who ſacrificed at the altar of liberty, to join the ruthleſs deſpots, who march to deſolate France, to reſtore the altars of a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous ſuperſtition, and to extinguiſh the celeſtial light which has burſt upon the human mind? O! my countrymen, when you are capable of ſuch monſtrous baſeneſs, even the patriot will invoke upon you the contempt of ages.</p>
                  <p>The man who can heſitate, after this compariſon, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce that our ambaſſador, and the majority of our ſenate, prefer Britiſh principles and Britiſh connections, to French principles and French connections, muſt be timid in thought, and ſervile in ſentiment. Yes, they prefer that mouldering, Gothic edifice, the Britiſh conſtitution, to the elegant temple of liberty, which philoſophy has juſt erected in France.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond article of this treaty permits the Britiſh ſubjects, ſettled in the weſtern poſts, to elect to remain Britiſh ſubjects at thoſe poſts, even after they are ceded. This article not only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iolates the ſacred principles of the common law, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:028389_0024_0FD8E6E154B763F8"/>that aliens cannot hold landed property, but operates as an indirect repeal of the late law of congreſs with reſpect to naturalization. If the preſident and ſenate have the power of repealing indirectly, or contravening even remotely, the laws, we are ſlaves! If they have not this power, a ratification will be an uſurpation. Men, ſituated within the territory of the United States, and holding immenſe landed property, will, in caſe of a rupture with Great Britain, be bound to attack our defenceleſs fellow citizens ſituated near them, to join the hoſtile Indians, and raiſe the war whoop of ſavage cruelty. By this article, the weſtern poſts are ceded by America to Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, until June, 1796. The power of ceding territory can only be exerciſed by congreſs. If this treaty is ratified, the preſident and ſenate will uſurp it. I contend that the ceſſion of thoſe poſts for one ſingle day, was as unconſtitutional as the ceſſion of them for ten thouſand years. Previous arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are to be made. What arrangements? Will not the Britiſh government propoſe ſome unreaſonable arrangement, and then juſtify a further detention of the poſts by our refuſal to make it?</p>
                  <p>The third article, like every other, wants that reciprocity which ſhould pervade the whole treaty. In return for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant privilege of trading to all our ports, ſubject to no higher duties than our own citizens, of bringing to our ports, in veſſels of any deſcription, the produce of any country on the face of the globe, we have the poor privilege of carrying to the ports of Great Britain the produce of our own country only, and of trading to the Weſt Indies in fiſhing boats for two years, provided we covenant not to export any produce imported from thoſe iſlands. This article is a regulation of commerce. The conſtitution gives the power of regulating commerce to congreſs. A ratification will be an uſurpation of this power. This objection embraces almoſt the whole treaty. Boldly aſſuming the name of a compact concerning commerce, it diſdains to render the conſtitution even the homage of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy. Here the abſurdity of giving to the preſident and ſenate the power of making treaties becomes apparent. All treaties either regulate commerce, or cede territory, or conclude a war, by leaving things in <hi>ſtatu quo.</hi> Treaties of the firſt and ſecond kind cannot be conſtitutionally made by the preſident and ſenate—Treaties of the third kind hardly ever occur. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, our conſtitution abſurdly gives to one body the power of making war, and to another the power of finiſhing it.</p>
                  <p>By the ſixth article, the American government is to aſſume the payment of Britiſh debts. This aſſumption is unconſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional.
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:028389_0025_0FD8E6E2CFAC11D8"/>All the power of the federal government with reſpect to debts, is given, by a conciſe article of the conſtitution, which declares that congreſs ſhall pay the debts of America. It is evident, that no ſtipulations with reſpect to debts, can conſtitutionally be made by the preſident and ſenate. This ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle manifeſts the ariſtocratical ſpirit, of which I have accuſed our late ambaſſador and the majority of the ſenate, by being unconſtitutional, by accuſing the ſtate legiſlatures which eman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipated America, of atrocious injuſtice, and by increaſing that debt which has already created an influence independent of the people. It increaſes the ignominious tribute which we now pay to Britiſh ſpeculators.</p>

The ninth article invades the rights of this commonwealth, by contemplating the caſe of Denny Fairfax.</p>
                  <p>The tenth article deprives congreſs of the power of ſequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and if the preſident and ſenate can deprive it of this power, they can deprive it of all powers.</p>
                  <p>Since the ſenate have had the modeſty to reject the twelfth article, a diſcuſſion of that is unneceſſary, except to ſhow that the ſervile condeſcenſion of our ambaſſador ſtartled even them.</p>
                  <p>The twenty-firſt article attacks the ſacred rights of expatria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. By this article, an American citizen who abjures his country, becomes a citizen of the French republic, and reſides there twenty years, may be puniſhed as a pirate, if he accepts a French commiſſion. This article defines piracy. The pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of defining piracy is given by the conſtitution to congreſs. If the treaty is ratified, the preſident and ſenate will uſurp this power too.</p>
                  <p>The twenty-third and twenty-fourth articles are incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the 17th of the French treaty. It is true, that a ſweeping clauſe declares, that ſtipulations contained in this treaty, ſhall not affect treaties exiſting with other nations. But the king of Great Britain denies that the French are a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Beſides, ſince the clauſe expreſſes nothing more than the law of nations implies, it is mere ſurpluſage. It muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and then the repugnancy of the two treaties becomes manifeſt.</p>
                  <p>I will now recapitulate the uſurpations which the preſident and ſenate will make if the treaty is ratified. They will uſurp the power of making rules with reſpect to aliens, of ceding territory, of regulating commerce, of paying debts, of regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting duties, of eſtabliſhing courts, and of defining piracies. The houſe of repreſentatives will be degraded to a houſe of commons; ſummoned to anſwer an addreſs, to regulate a few ſubjects of internal policy, and to vote money. But this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will not be ratified. The illuſtrious preſident, who admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters our government, will not abandon, in his venerable old age, the generous maxims, the nice honor, the pure virtue, and the ardent patriotiſm, which have elevated him to ſave his country. He will view with indignation, the gigantic wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which ſeeks, through the medium of a perfidious treaty, to render him an apoſtate, and to deſtroy at one blow, the commerce, the conſtitution, and the honor of his country.</p>

                  <p>The chairman having put the queſtion, the reſolution was unanimouſly adopted.</p>
                  <p>It was then moved, that the treaty ſhould be read, and a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic diſcuſſion of its merits take place.</p>
                  <p>But it was obſerved by ſome, that the reading of it would take up too much time; that every body muſt be ſuppoſed now to be acquainted with its contents; and that there were many perſons preſent, who had to return home ſome diſtance in the country.</p>
                  <p>A great number, however, declared that it was eſſentially neceſſary, to prevent any reflections being thrown on their proceedings, to have the treaty read, and to permit a free diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion on this occaſion. The meeting at New York had been highly criminated on this very account; and they hoped, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the preſent aſſembly would have more prudence than to lay themſelves open to the ſame aſperſions which had been caſt upon others.</p>
                  <p>The gentlemen having withdrawn their oppoſition, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was unanimouſly agreed to.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon the treaty was read by the ſecretary.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Rodney ſaid he was not ſo anxious to expreſs his own ſentiments on this occaſion, as he was to hear the opinion of a venerable patriot in that houſe, whoſe head had grown grey in the faithful diſcharge of his duties in the legiſlative, judicial, and executive departments of government.</p>
                  <p>John Dickinſon then roſe, and obſerved, that he had felt it his duty to appear on this momentous occaſion, and publicly avow his ſentiments concerning this treaty; but as the hand of age and infirmity was upon him, he hoped that ſome younger citizen than himſelf would take the labouring oar, and break the way, in order that the elder might the more eaſily follow. When that was done, the duty he owed to himſelf and his country, be ſaid, would compel him to expreſs his feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the preſent occaſion.</p>
                  <p>Mr. RODNEY ſaid, that as it was the wiſh of the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who had juſt ſat down, that ſome younger perſon than himſelf ſhould lead the way to this diſcuſſion, he would offer a ſew general obſervations on the treaty, which they had now fully and fairly before them, for their conſideration. He did not intend to go through with it article by article; he only meant to touch ſlightly on ſome of the principal objections, and leave the reſt to a more able hand; indeed it would be in vain to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:028389_0029_0FD8E6ED56588520"/>to notice every objection, for the ſubject of objection appeared to him to be exhauſtleſs.</p>
                  <p>Before he proceeded to the immediate diſcuſſion of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty itſelf, he requeſted permiſſion to make a ſew candid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon what he thought (and ſurely, ſaid he, in a free country, every man has a right to think, and a right to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his opinions, too) the extraordinary manner in which this treaty had been brought about. In the firſt place, at the very moment when the repreſentatives of the people were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberating on the beſt mode of obtaining redreſs and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the injuries and inſults we had ſuſtained, and the griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances under which we then laboured; at that moment their proceedings were unfortunately arreſted.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, the chief juſtice of the United States was appointed (without a reſignation) to the important office of miniſter plenipotentiary and envoy extraordinary to the court of Britain; if theſe meaſures were not againſt the letter, they were ſurely againſt the ſpirit of the conſtitution.

He had two general objections to the treaty itſelf. He was one of thoſe who thought it would be for the real intereſt of America to have no treaty at all with Britain; five years out of ſeven ſhe had the ſword unſheathed, and the temple of Janus open. As our object ought to be (ſaid he) and I hope ever will be, peace, we ſhould carefully ſhun all connection with ſuch a nation, for fear of being involved in her quarrels: But at this time, when ſhe was at war with the French republic, our generous and brave ally, who aſſiſted us when ſtruggling in the ſame cauſe, and when the flag of freedom drooped under the iron rod of oppreſſion, it was the height of folly to form ſuch a treaty with her: For even ſuppoſing France and Britain were equally indifferent to us (and who is there that hears me, whoſe boſom is ſo frozen with ingratitude, as to view them
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:028389_0031_0FD8E6F05401EAF0"/>with equal indifference) a treaty ſo pointedly levelled at the French as this appears to be throughout, and which gives up to Britain privileges which will put it in her power ſo materially to injure them, might by the law of nations be conſtrued a breach of that neutrality which we ſeen one and all to be ſo anxious to preſerve.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Chairman (he proceeded) the omiſſions in this treaty are numerous and important. If the meſſage of the preſident is to be taken as the ground-work of the envoy's inſtructions, and I think it ought, he was ſent to procure a <hi>friendly adjuſtment of our complaints;</hi>
                     <note n="(4)" place="bottom">See extract from the preſident's meſſage in note 2.</note> and amongſt thoſe complaints, what were the firſt? and which ſtared us foremoſt in the face? Our weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern poſts had been detained from us ever ſince the peace, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to treaty; in conſequence of which we had been expoſed to a ruinous Indian war; property to an immenſe amount had been taken off by the Britiſh, in contravention of the ſame treaty; our ſailors had been cruelly and unjuſtly preſſed from on board our veſſels, ſo that they were unable, for want of hands, to return, if liberty had been given them to depart. Are any damages obtained for the detention of the poſts theſe thirteen years? No! Are any obtained for the blood of our fellow citizens laviſhed, and the treaſures of the people ſpent in the Indian war? Or for the innocent women and children who have fallen a ſacrifice to ſavage cruelty, and the murdering tomahawk and ſcalping knife? No! Is the property unjuſtly carried off by the Britiſh, ſtipulated to be paid for? No! Has any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>The third article, giving the Britiſh the benefit of all our Atlantic ports and inland navigation, and entirely excluding us, on their part, from both, requires no comment; it will not, for I am ſure it cannot, be contended that there is any recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city here.</p>
                  <p>That article ſhould never have been admitted, which puts the ſtale claims of Britiſh creditors on a footing with our plain demands for the plunder of our merchants; on a footing, did I ſay? on a far better footing; for while in the one caſe, by a ſummary mode of procedure, our citizens are robbed of that

                  <p>Mr. Chairman (added he) the great object, if I am not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, of our government, has been to continue neutral during the war which at preſent convulſes the greater part of Europe; and yet while we are ſtruggling to preſerve this happy ſituation, in order that the bleſſings of peace and plenty may pour in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, we find in this treaty all the rights of neutrality aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and the axe laid to the root of the very tree from which we expected to gather ſuch abundant fruit. The great principle of neutrality, ſo eſſentially neceſſary to the very exiſtence of commerce, <hi>that free bottoms ſhall make free goods,</hi> is here given up; a principle, ſince the year 1780, eſtabliſhed as the law of nations. I know, previous to that year, the arbitrary and ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior power of Britain had ruled it otherwiſe; but then the empreſs of Ruſſia, in conjunction with Sweden and Denmark, eſtabliſhed the <hi>armed neutrality,</hi> the very ſecond article of which recognized this principle, and in ſupport of which Ruſſia re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to her treaty with Britain in 1734, in which this principle is indiſputably eſtabliſhed. To theſe principles the commercial nations of Europe fully acceded—Agreeably to theſe principles, Britain afterwards uniformly conducted herſelf during the American war; and to theſe principles we have rigidly adhered in every treaty hitherto made, and the Britiſh themſelves in their treaty with France in 1786.<note n="(6)" place="bottom">Articles of the armed neutrality.

                        <p>Indeed the Britiſh carried their ideas of free commerce, A. D. 1739, much farther. The following reſolution then paſſed both houſes of parliament, and was approved of by the king!</p>

                  <p>That, revering conſtitutional authority as the baſis of peace and proſperity, and holding themſelves in duty bound to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port its deciſions, even though they may have oppoſed their being made, they truſt, that on the preſent occaſion, they ſhall not be expoſed to controverſies reſpecting the legitimate exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of that authority, nor be obliged, in ſupporting its deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to feel an adherence to duty almoſt as afflicting as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from it—</p>

That for this deliverance, they confidently recur to that portion of neutrality, with which, by the conſtitution, you are inveſted, and in which they are ſo greatly, inſeparably, and ſacredly intereſted; and, encouraged by a retroſpect to thoſe actions whoſe tenor deſignates your character, while they ſubmit to your conſideration the following objections againſt the treaty, lately negociated between Great Britain and theſe ſtates, they ardently hope, your mind, moved by reaſons itſelf ſuggeſts, or obſervations of others, will be ſatisfied, that in refuſing to ratify it, you will promote the happineſs of your conſtituents—</p>
                  <p>Firſt. It unneceſſarily draws into litigation the boundaries of theſe ſtates, and eſtabliſhes a mode of proceeding, by which they may be contracted, without the conſent of the nation.</p>
                  <p>Second. It contains ſtipulations that ought not to be made without legiſlative authority.</p>
                  <p>Third. It fixes terms of commerce and navigation unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably advantageous to Great Britain, and highly injurious to theſe ſtates.</p>
                  <p>Fourth. It ſubjects theſe ſtates to an unjuſt and oppreſſive reſponſibility.</p>
                  <p>Fifth. It ſurrenders, on the part of theſe ſtates, powers eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to national independence.</p>
                  <p>Sixth. It prejudicially changes the condition of theſe ſtates, in reference to other nations.</p>
                  <p>Seventh. It abandons principles concerning the rights of neutrality, which, if duly regarded, muſt have an auſpicious influence on the welfare of theſe ſtates, and of mankind in general.</p>
                  <p>Eighth. It alters the poſition of theſe ſtates relative to the belligerent powers, in favor of Great Britain, and to the detriment of France; thus relinquiſhing a declared impartiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and hazarding the immunities belonging to ſuch a ſituation.</p>
                  <p>Ninth. It is in colliſion with articles of the treaty between France and the United States of America.</p>
                  <p>Tenth. It exhibits theſe ſtates to the world as not attentive to the obligations of friendſhip, gratitude, and public faith.</p>
                  <p>Eleventh. It is not founded on principles of real reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procity.</p>
                  <p>Twelfth. It does not, with ſufficient clearneſs, certainty, and ſecurity, provide for the ſurrender of "all the poſts and places" mentioned in the ſecond article, and hitherto detained in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travention, of the treaty of peace.</p>
                  <p>

Thirteenth. It does not require ſatisfaction for "the property of the American inhabitants carried away," at the cloſe of the late war, in manifeſt violation of that treaty.</p>
                  <p>Fourteenth. It does not adequately obtain redreſs for the notorious vexations and ſpoliations recently committed on the veſſels and commerce of theſe ſtates, nor guard againſt the like in future.</p>
                  <p>Fifteenth. It does not in any manner provide for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of American ſeamen againſt the flagrant aggreſſions conſtantly practiſed by the Britiſh government, in preſſing them to ſerve on board its ſhips of war.</p>
                  <p>The memorial was then read by the ſecretary, and afterwards read and agreed to by paragraphs; and upon the main queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, "Does this report meet the approbation of the meeting?" It was unanimouſly determined in the affirmative.</p>

                  <p>IN every act of my adminiſtration, I have ſought the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of my fellow citizens. My ſyſtem, for the attainment of this object, has uniformly been, to overlook all perſonal, local, and partial conſiderations; to contemplate the United States as one great whole; to confide, that ſudden impreſſions, when erroneous, would yield to candid reflection; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult only the ſubſtantial and permanent intereſts of our country.</p>
                  <p>Nor have I departed from this line of conduct, on the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which has produced the reſolutions contained in your letter of the 13th inſt.</p>
                  <p>Without a predilection for my own judgment, I have weighed with attention, every argument which has, at any time, been brought into view. But the conſtitution is the guide which I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can abandon. It has aſſigned to the preſident the power of making treaties, with the advice and conſent of the ſenate. It was doubtleſs ſuppoſed that theſe two branches of government would combine, without paſſion, and with the beſt means of information, thoſe facts and principles upon which the ſucceſs of our foreign relations will always depend; that they ought not to ſubſtitute for their own conviction the opinions of others; or to ſeek truth through any channel but that of a temperate and well informed inveſtigation.</p>
                  <p>Under this perſuaſion, I have reſolved on the manner of executing the duty before me. To the high reſponſibility attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it, I freely ſubmit: and you, gentlemen, are at liberty to make theſe ſentiments known as the grounds of my procedure. While I feel the moſt lively gratitude for the many inſtances of approbation from my country, I can no otherwiſe deſerve it, than by obeying the dictates of my conſcience.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Extract from one of the Federal Farmer's Letters, dated January <hi>10, 1788.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>ON a fair conſtruction of the conſtitution, I think the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature has a proper controul over the preſident and ſenate, in ſettling commercial treaties.—By one article, "the legiſlature ſhall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations," &amp;c. and by another article, "the preſident, with the advice and conſent of two-thirds of the ſenate, ſhall have power to make treaties." Theſe clauſes muſt be conſidered together; and we ought never to make one part of the ſame inſtrument contradict ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if it can be avoided by any reaſonable conſtruction. By the firſt recited clauſe, the legiſlature has <hi>the power,</hi> that is, as I underſtand it, <hi>the ſole power,</hi> to regulate commerce with foreign nations, or to make all the rules and regulations reſpecting trade and commerce, between our citizens and foreigners. By the ſecond recited clauſe, the preſident and ſenate have power generally to make treaties.—There are ſeveral kinds of treaties, as treaties of commerce, of peace, of alliance, &amp;c. I think the words "to make treaties," may be conſiſtently conſtru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     <head>No. I.</head>
                     <p>IT was to have been foreſeen, that the treaty which mr. Jay was charged to negociate with Great-Britain, whene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it ſhould appear, would have to contend with many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe diſpoſitions, and ſome honeſt prejudices; that there was no meaſure in which the government could engage, ſo little likely to be viewed according to its intrinſic merits—ſo very likely to encounter miſconception, jealouſy, and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable diſlike. For this, many reaſons may be aſſigned.</p>
                     <p>It is only to know the vanity and vindictiveneſs of human nature, to be convinced, that while this generation laſts, there will always exiſt among us, men irreconcilable to our preſent national conſtitution; embittered in their animoſity in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſucceſs of its operations, and the diſappointment of their inauſpicious predictions. It is a material inference from this, that ſuch men will watch, with lynx's eyes, for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of diſcrediting the proceedings of the government, and will diſplay a hoſtile and malignant zeal upon every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, where they think there are any prepoſſeſſions of the community to favour their enterprizes. A treaty with Great-Britain was too fruitful an occaſion not to call forth all their activity.</p>
                     <p>It is only to conſult the hiſtory of nations, to perceive, that every country, at all times, is curſed by the exiſtence of men, who, actuated by an irregular ambition, ſcruple nothing which they imagine will contribute to their own advancement and importance: in monarchies, ſupple courtiers; in republics, fawning or turbulent demagogues, worſhipping ſtill the idol, power, wherever placed, whether in the hands of a prince or of the people, and trafficing in the weakneſſes, vices, frailties, or prejudices of the one or the other. It was to have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that ſuch men, counting more on the paſſions than on the reaſon of their fellow citizens, and anticipating that the treaty would have to ſtruggle with prejudices, would be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:028389_0041_0FD8E70D9120DB70"/>to make an alliance with popular diſcontent, to nouriſh it, and to preſs it into the ſervice of their particular views.</p>
                     <p>It was not to have been doubted, that there would be one or more foreign powers, indiſpoſed to a meaſure which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated our differences with Great-Britain, and laid the foundation of future good underſtanding, merely becauſe it had that effect.</p>
                     <p>Nations are never content to confine their rivalſhips and enmities to themſelves. It is their uſual policy, to diſſeminate them as widely as they can, regardleſs how far it may interfere with the tranquillity or happineſs of the nations which they are able to influence.—Whatever pretenſions may be made, the world is yet remote from the ſpectacle of that juſt and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous policy, whether in the cabinets of republies or of king which would diſpoſe one nation, in its intercourſes with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther— ſatisfied with a due proportion of privileges and benefits to ſee that other purſue freely, its true intereſt with rega<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>It was not to be miſtaken, that an enthuſiaſm for France
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:028389_0042_0FD8E716F31AB3E0"/>and her revolution, throughout all its wonderful viciſſitudes, has continued to poſſeſs the minds of the great body of the people of this country; and it was to be inferred, that this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent would prediſpoſe to a jealouſy of any agreement or treaty with her moſt perſevering competitor—a jealouſy ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive, as would give the fulleſt ſcope to inſidious arts to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex and miſlead the public opinion. It was well underſtood, that a numerous party among us, though diſavowing the deſign, becauſe the avowal would defeat it, have been ſteadily endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to make the United States a party in the preſent Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean war, by advocating all thoſe meaſures which would widen the breach betweeen us and Great-Britain, and by reſiſting all thoſe which would tend to cloſe it; and it was morally cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that this party would eagerly improve every circumſtance which could ſerve to render the treaty odious, and to fruſtrate it, as the moſt effectual road to their favourite goal.</p>
                     <p>It was alſo known beforehand, that perſonal and party ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valſhips, of the moſt active kind, would aſſail whatever treaty might be made, to diſgrace, if poſſible, its organ.</p>
                     <p>There are three perſons prominent in the public eye, as the ſucceſſor of the actual preſident of the United States, in the event of his retreat from the ſtation, mr. Adams, mr. Jay, and mr. Jefferſon.</p>
                     <p>No one has forgotten the ſyſtematic pains which have been taken to impair the well-earned popularity of the firſt gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Mr. Jay, too, has been repeatedly the object of attacks with the ſame view. His friends, as well as his enemies, anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipated that he could make no treaty which would not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh weapons againſt him: and it were to have been ignorant of the indefatigable malice of his adverſaries, to have doubted that they would be ſeized with eagerneſs and wielded with dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity.</p>
                     <p>The peculiar circumſtances which have attended the two laſt elections for governor of this ſtate<note n="*" place="bottom">New-York.</note>, have been of a nature to give the utmoſt keenneſs to party animoſity. It was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that mr. Jay ſhould be forgiven for his double, and, in the laſt inſtance, triumphant ſucceſs; or that any promiſing opportunity of detaching from him the public confidence, ſhould paſs unimproved.</p>
                     <p>Trivial facts frequently throw light upon important de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. It is remarkable, that in the toaſts given on the 4th of
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:028389_0043_0FD8E7181098EE90"/>July, wherever there appears a direct or indirect cenſure of the treaty, it is pretty uniformly coupled with compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to mr. Jefferſon, and to our late governor, mr. Clin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, with an evident deſign to place thoſe gentlemen in contraſt with mr. Jay, and, decrying him, to elevate them. No one can be blind to the ſinger of party ſpirit, viſible in theſe and ſimilar tranſactions. It indicates to us clearly, one powerful ſource of oppoſition to the treaty.</p>
                     <p>No man is without his perſonal enemies. Pre-eminence even in talents and virtue is a cauſe of envy and hatred of its poſſeſſor. Bad men are the natural enemies of virtuous men. Good men ſometimes miſtake and diſlike each other.</p>
                     <p>Upon ſuch an occaſſion as the treaty, how could it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen otherwiſe, than that <hi>perſonal enmity</hi> would be unuſually buſy, enterpriſing, and malignant?</p>
                     <p>From the combined operation of theſe different cauſes, it would have been a vain expectation that the treaty would be generally contemplated with candour and moderation, or that reaſon would regulate the firſt impreſſions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. It was certain, on the contrary, that however unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable its true character might be, it would have to ſight its way through a maſs of unreaſonable oppoſition; and that time, examination, and reflection, would be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to ſix the public opinion on a true baſis. It was certain that it would become the inſtrument of a ſyſtematic effort againſt the national government and its adminiſtration; a decided engine of party to advance its own views at the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of the public peace and proſperity.</p>
                     <p>The events which have already taken place, are a full comment on theſe poſitions. If the good ſenſe of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple does not ſpeedily diſcountenance the projects which are on foot, more melancholy proofs may ſucceed.</p>
                     <p>Before the treaty was known, attempts were made to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs the public mind againſt it. It was abſurdly aſſerted, that it was not expected by the people, that mr. Jay was to make any treaty; as if he had been ſent, not to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date differences by negociation and agreement, but to dictate to Great-Britain the terms of an unconditional ſubmiſſion.</p>
                     <p>Before it was publiſhed at large, a ſketch, calculated to produce falſe impreſſions, was handed out to the public, through a medium noted for hoſtility to the adminiſtration of the government.—E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>ſſaries flew through the country, ſpreading alarm and diſcontent: the leaders of clubs were
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:028389_0044_0FD8E71A4F7346C8"/>every where active to ſeize the paſſions of the people, and pre-occupy their judgments againſt the treaty.</p>
                     <p>At Boſton it was publiſhed one day, and the next a town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meeting was convened to condemn it, without ever being read; without any ſerious diſcuſſion, ſentence was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt it.</p>
                     <p>Will any man ſeriouſly believe, that in ſo ſhort a time, an inſtrument of this nature could have been tolerably under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the greater part of thoſe who were thus induced to a condemnation of it? Can the reſult be conſidered as any thing more than a ſudden ebullition of popular paſſion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by the artifices of a party, which had adroitly ſeized a favourable moment to furorize the public opinion; this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of precipitation and the intemperance which accompanied it, prevented the body of the merchants and the greater part of the moſt conſiderate citizens, from attending the meeting, and left thoſe who met wholly under the guidance of a ſet of men, who, with two or three exceptions, have been the uniform oppoſers of the government.</p>
                     <p>The intelligence of this event had no ſooner reached New-York, than the leaders of the clubs were ſeen haranguing in every corner of the city, to ſtir up our citizens into an imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the example of the meeting at Boſton. An invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to meet at the city-hall quickly followed, not to conſider or diſcuſs the merits of the treaty, but to unite with the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Boſton to addreſs the preſident againſt its ratification.</p>
                     <p>This was immediately ſucceeded by a hand bill, full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives againſt the treaty, as abſurd as they were inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and manifeſtly deſigned to induce the citizens to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their reaſon to the empire of their paſſions.</p>
                     <p>In vain did a reſpectable meeting of the merchants endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, by their advice, to moderate the violence of theſe views, and to promote a ſpirit favourable to a fair diſcuſſion of the treaty; in vain did a reſpectable majority of the citizens of every deſcription attend for that purpoſe. The leaders of the clubs reſiſted all diſcuſſion, and their followers, by their cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors and vociferations, rendered it impracticable, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the wiſh of a manifeſt majority of the citizens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened upon the occaſion.</p>
                     <p>Can we believe, that the leaders were really ſincere in the objections they made to a diſcuſſion, or that the great and mixed maſs of citizens then aſſembled, had ſo thoroughly maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:028389_0045_0FD8E720A5AE5108"/>the merits of the treaty as that they might not have been enlightened by ſuch a diſcuſſion.</p>
                     <p>It cannot be doubled that the real motive to the oppoſition, was the fear of a diſcuſſion; the deſire of excluding light; the adherence to a plan of ſurprize and deception. Nor need we deſire any fuller proof of the ſpirit of party which has ſtimulated the oppoſition to the treaty, than is to be found in the circumſtances of that oppoſition.</p>
                     <p>To every man who is not an enemy to the national govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who is not a prejudiced partizan, who is capable of comprehending the argument, and diſpaſſionate enough to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to it with impartiality, I flatter myſelf I ſhall be able to demonſtrate ſatisfactorily in the courſe of ſome ſucceeding papers.—</p>

                     <p>PREVIOUS to a more particular diſcuſſion of the merits of the treaty, it may be uſeful to advert to a ſuggeſtion which has been thrown out, namely, That it was foreſeen by many, that the miſſion to Great-Britain would produce no good reſult, and that the event has correſponded with the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation.</p>
                     <p>The reverſe of this poſition is manifeſtly true.</p>
                     <p>All muſt remember the very critical poſture of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, at the time that miſſion was reſolved upon. A recent viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our rights, too flagrant and too injurious to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to, had filled every American breaſt with indignation, and every prudent man with alarm and diſquietude. A few hoped, and the great body of the community feared, that war was inevitable.</p>
                     <p>In this criſis, two ſets of opinions prevailed, one looked to meaſures which were to have a compulſory effect upon Great-Britain, the ſequeſtration of Britiſh debts, and the cutting off intercourſe wholly or partially between the two countries: the other to <hi>vigorous preparations</hi> for war, and <hi>one more effort</hi> of negociation, under the ſolemnity of an extraordinary miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to avert it.</p>
                     <p>That the latter was the beſt opinion, no truly ſenſible man can doubt; and it may be boldly affirmed, that the event has entirely juſtified it.</p>
                     <p>If meaſures of coercion and repriſal had taken place, war, in all human probability, would have followed.</p>
                     <p>National pride is generally a very untractable thing. In the councils of no country does it act with greater force, than in thoſe of Great-Britain. Whatever it might have been in her power to yield to negociation, ſhe could have yielded nothing to compulſion, without ſelf-degradation, and without the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of that political conſequence, which, at all times very important to a nation, was peculiarly ſo to her at the juncture in queſtion. It ſhould be remembered, too, that from the relations
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:028389_0047_0FD8E72412C4EE80"/>in which the two countries have ſtood to each other, it muſt have coſt more to the pride of Great-Britain to have received the law from us than from any other power.</p>
                     <p>When one nation has cauſe of complaint againſt another, the courſe marked out by practice, the opinion of writers, and the principles of humanity, the object being to avoid war, is to precede repriſals of any kind, by a demand of reparation. To begin with repriſals is to meet on the ground of war, and puts the other party in a condition not to be able to recede without humiliation.</p>
                     <p>Had this courſe been purſued by us, it would not only have rendered war morally certain, but it would have united the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh nation in the vigorous ſupport of their government, in the proſecution of it: while, on our part, we ſhould have been quickly diſtracted and divided. The calamities of war would have brought the moſt ardent to their ſenſes, and placed them among the firſt in reproaching the government with precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, raſhneſs, and folly, for not having taken every chance, by pacific means, to avoid ſo great an evil.</p>
                     <p>The example of Denmark and Sweden is cited in ſupport of the coercive plan. Thoſe powers, it is aſſerted, by arming and acting with vigour, brought Great-Britain to terms.</p>
                     <p>But who is able to tell us the preciſe courſe of this tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, or the terms gained by it? Has it appeared that either Denmark or Sweden has obtained as much as we have done— a ſtipulation of reparation for the violation of our property, contrary to the laws of war?</p>
                     <p>Beſides, what did Denmark and Sweden do? They armed, and they negociated. They did not begin by retaliations and repriſals. The United States alſo armed and negociated, and, like Denmark and Sweden, prudently forbore repriſals. The conduct of the three countries agreed in principle, equally ſteering clear of a precipitate reſort to repriſals, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting the doctrines and advice of our war party.</p>
                     <p>The courſe purſued by our government was then in coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidence with the example of Denmark and Sweden—and, it may be added, was in every view the wiſeſt.</p>
                     <p>Few nations can have ſtronger inducements than the United-States to cultivate peace. Their infant ſtate in general—their want of a marine in particular, to protect their commerce, would render war, in an extreme degree, a calamity. It would not only arreſt our preſent rapid progreſs to ſtrength and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, but would probably throw us back into a ſtate of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:028389_0048_0FD8E725A5C0C3B0"/>and impoveriſhment, from which it would require years to emerge.</p>
                     <p>Our trade, navigation, and mercantile capital, would be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially deſtroyed. Spain being an aſſociate with Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, a general Indian war might be expected to deſolate the whole extent of our frontier—our exports obſtructed, agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would of courſe languiſh; all other branches of induſtry would proportionably ſuffer; our public debt inſtead of a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual diminution, would ſuſtain a great augmentation, and draw with it a large increaſe of taxes and burthens on the people.</p>
                     <p>But theſe evils, however great, were, perhaps, not the worſt to be apprehended. It was to be feared, that the war would be conducted in a ſpirit which would render it more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily calamitous. There are too many proofs, that a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable party among us is deeply infected with thoſe horrid principles of jacobiniſm, which, proceeding from one exceſs to another, have made France a theatre of blood, and which, notwithſtanding the moſt vigorous efforts of the national re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation to ſuppreſs it, keeps the deſtinies of France, to this moment, ſuſpended by a thread. It was too probable, that the direction of the war, if commenced, would have fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of men of this deſcription. The conſequence of this, even in imagination, are ſuch as to make any virtuous man ſhudder.</p>
                     <p>It was, therefore, in a peculiar manner, the duty of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to take all poſſible chances for avoiding war. The plan adopted was the only one which could claim this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
                     <p>To precipitate nothing, to gain time by negociation, was to leave the country in a ſituation to profit by any events which might turn up, tending to reſtrain a ſpirit of hoſtility in Great-Britain, and to diſpoſe her to reaſonable accommodation.</p>
                     <p>The ſucceſſes of France, which opportunely occurred, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to have had an influence upon the iſſue, ſo far from diſparaging the merit of the plan that was purſued, ſerve to illuſtrate its wiſdom. This was one of the chances which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſtination gave, and one which it was natural to take into the calculation.</p>
                     <p>Had the reverſe been the caſe, the poſture of negociation was ſtill preferable to that of retaliation and repriſal; for in this caſe, the triumphs of Great-Britain, the gauntlet hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:028389_0049_0FD8E72C2EDDC1C8"/>been thrown by us, would have ſtimulated her to take i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> up without heſitation.</p>
                     <p>By taking the ground of negociation in the attitude of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for war, we at the ſame time carried the appeal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>This conduct was calculated to range the public opinion of that country on our ſide, to oppoſe it to the indulgence of hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile views in the cabinet, and, in caſe of war, to lay the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of ſchiſm and diſſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>But one of the moſt important advantages to be expected from the courſe purſued, was the ſecuring of unanimity among ourſelves, if, after all the pains taken to avoid a war, it had been forced upon us.</p>

                     <p>To all this it may be added, that one of the ſubſtitutes for the plan purſued, the ſequeſtration of debts, was a meaſure no leſs diſhoneſt than impolitic; as will be ſhown in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks which will be applied to the 10th article of the treaty.</p>
                     <p>But is it unimportant to the real friends of republican go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that the plan purſued was congenial to the pacific character which is aſcribed to it? Would it have been more deſirable that the government of our nation, outſtripping the war-maxims of Europe, ſhould, without a previous demand of reparation, have ruſhed into repriſals, and conſequently into a war?</p>
                     <p>However this may be, it is a well aſcertained fact, that our country never appeared ſo auguſt and reſpectable as in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition which it aſſumed upon this occaſion.—Europe was ſtruck with the dignified moderation of our conduct; and the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of our government and nation acquired a new ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                     <p>It cannot eſcape an attentive obſerver, that the language, which, in the firſt inſtance, condemned the miſſion of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy extraordinary to Great-Britain, and which now condemns the treaty negociated by him, ſeems to conſider the United States as among the firſt rate powers of the world in point of ſtrength and reſources, and propoſes to them a conduct pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated from that condition.</p>
                     <p>To under-rate our juſt importance, would be a degrading error. To over-rate it, may lead to dangerous miſtakes.</p>
                     <p>A very powerful ſtate may frequently hazard a high and haughty tone with good policy; but a weak ſtate can ſcarcely ever do it without imprudence. The laſt is yet our character; tho' we are the embryo of a great empire. It is, therefore, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuited to our ſituation to meaſure each ſtep with the utmoſt caution; to hazard as little as poſſible, in the caſes in which we are injured; to blend moderation with firmeneſs; and to brandiſh the weapons of hoſtility only when it is apparent that the uſe of them is unavoidable.</p>
                     <p>It is not to be inferred from this, that we are to crouch to any power on earth, or tamely to ſuffer our rights to be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. A nation which is capable of this meanneſs, will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have no rights to protect, or honour to defend.</p>

But the true inference is, that we ought not lightly to feet or provoke a reſort to arms; that, in the differences between us and other nations, we ought carefully to avoid meaſures which tend to widen the breach; and that we ſhould ſcr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>If we can avoid a war for ten or twelve years more, we ſhall then have acquired a maturity, which will make it no more than a common calamity, and will authoriſe us, in our national diſcuſſions, to take a higher and more impoſing to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

This curſory view of the motives which may be ſuppoſed to have governed our public councils in the miſſion to Great-Britain, ſerves not only to vindicate the meaſures then purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but warns us againſt a prejudiced judgment of the reſult, which may, in the end, defeat the ſalutary purpoſes of thoſe meaſures.</p>
                     <p>I proceed now to obſerve ſummarily, that the objects of the miſſion, contrary to what has been aſſerted, have been ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially obtained. What were theſe? They were principally,

                     <p>The proviſions with regard to commerce, were incidental and auxiliary. The reaſons which may be conceived to have led to the including of the ſubject in the miſſion, will be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed in ſome proper place.</p>

                     <p>THE oppoſers of the treaty ſeem to have put invention on the rack, to accumulate charges againſt it, in a great number of caſes, without regard even to plauſibility.

Upon this, as upon all former oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, the good ſenſe of the people muſt be relied upon; and it muſt be taken for granted, that it will be ſufficient for their conviction, to give ſolid anſwers to all ſuch objections as have the ſemblance of reaſon; that now, as heretofore, they will maintain their character abroad and at home, for deliberation and reflection, and diſappoint thoſe who are in the habit of making experiments upon their credulity, who, treating them as children, fancy that ſugar-plumbs and toys will ſuffice to gain their confidence and attachment, and to lead them blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, whither ſoever it is deſired.</p>

                        </gap>s this object. All this, it is alleged, has been the uniform lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of our government, and has been demonſtrated by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>r. Jefferſon to be true, in his letter to mr. Hammond, of the
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:028389_0054_0FD8E73C2CB0B450"/>29th of May, 1792; and it is aſſerted, that the ground ought not to have been given up by mr. Jay, becauſe it was the ſtandard of the mutual rights and duties of the parties, as to the points unexecuted of the treaty of peace.</p>
                     <p>A proper examination of theſe matters is therefore called for, not only by the ſpecific objection which is made to the principle which is contained in the preamble, but by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence which a right ſolution is calculated to have, in giving a favourable or unfavourable complexion to the whole plan of the adjuſtment.</p>
                     <p>It is true, as ſuggeſted, that our government has conſtantly charged as breaches of the treaty by Great-Britain, the two particulars which have been ſtated; but it is believed to be not true, that it has uniformly charged them as FIRST breaches of the treaty. Individuals may have entertained this idea. The ſtate of Virginia ſeems to have proceeded upon it in ſome pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic acts; but as far as is recollected, that ground was never formally or explicitly taken by the government of the United States in the above-mentioned letter from mr. Jefferſon to mr. Hammond, when, for the firſt time, an attempt was made to vindicate or excuſe the whole conduct of this country, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the treaty of peace, contrary, I will venture to ſay, to the general ſenſe of well-informed men.</p>
                     <p>The moſt ſolemn act of our government on this head, is an addreſs of congreſs to the different ſtates, of the 13th of April, 1787.</p>
                     <p>This addreſs admits contraventions of the treaty on our part; and inſtead of deriving either juſtification or extenuation of them from prior infractions by Great-Britain, urges the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſtates to a repeal of all contravening laws.</p>
                     <p>But if the fact, in this reſpect, were admitted to be, as ſtated by the adverſaries of the treaty, it would not authoriſe their concluſion.</p>
                     <p>It would not follow, that, becauſe the ground had been taken by the government, it ought to have been pertinaciouſly kept, if, upon fair examination, it had appeared to be not ſolid, or if an adherence to it would have obſtructed a reaſonable adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of differences.</p>
                     <p>Nations, no more than individuals, ought to perſiſt in error, eſpecially at the ſacrifice of their peace and proſperity —be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, nothing is more common, in diſputes between nations, than each ſide to charge the other with being the aggreſſor or delinquent. This mutual crimination, either from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:028389_0055_0FD8E73D8EFFA920"/>of circumſtances, or from the illuſions of the paſſions, is ſometimes ſincere; at other times, it is dictated by pride or, policy—But in all ſuch caſes, where one party is not power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enough to dictate to the other, and where there is a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual diſpoſition to avoid war; the natural retreat for both is in compromiſe, which waves the queſtion of firſt aggreſſion or delinquency. This is the ſalvo for national pride; the eſcape for mutual error; the bridge by which nations, arrayed againſt each other, are enabled to retire with honor, and without blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, from the field of conteſt. In caſes of mutual delinquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, the queſtion of the firſt default is frequently attended with real difficulty and doubt.—One ſide has an equal right with the other, to have and maintain its opinion.—What is to be done, when the pride of neither will yield to the argument of the other? War, or a waver of the point, is the alternative What ſenſible man, what humane man, will deny, that a compromiſe, which ſecures ſubſtantially the objects of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, is almoſt always preferable to war on ſo punctilious and unmanageable a point?</p>

It has been obſerved, that two breaches of the treaty of peace are charged upon Great-Britain; the carrying away of the Negroes, and the detention of the poſts. It remains to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigate the reality of theſe breaches, and to fix the periods when they can be ſaid to have happened.</p>
                     <p>As to the Negroes, the true ſenſe of the article in the treaty of peace, which reſpects them, is diſputed.</p>
                     <p>The words of the ſtipulation are (Art. 7.) that "his Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic majeſty ſhall, with all convenient ſpeed, and without <hi>cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any deſtruction</hi> or <hi>carrying away any Negroes</hi> or <hi>other proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the American</hi> inhabitants withdraw all his armies, gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons, and fleets, from the United States."</p>
                     <p>Theſe terms admit of two conſtructions; one, that no Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, or other articles which <hi>had been</hi> American property, ſhould be carried away; the other, that the evacuations were to be made, <hi>without depredation;</hi> conſequently, that no new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction was to be committed, and that: Negroes, or other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, which, at the time of the ceſſation of hoſtilities, <hi>continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be</hi> the <hi>property</hi> of American inhabitants, unexchanged by the operations of war, ſhould be forborne to be carried away.</p>
                     <p>The firſt was the conſtruction which was adopted by this country; and the laſt is that inſiſted upon by Great-Britain.</p>
                     <p>The arguments which ſupport her conſtruction, are theſe:</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>I. The eſtabliſhed laws of war give to an enemy the <hi>uſe</hi> and <hi>enjoyment,</hi> during the war, of all <hi>coal</hi> property, of which he obtains poſſeſſion, and the abſolute ownerſhip of all <hi>perſonal</hi> property which falls into his hands.

                        <item>II. Negroes, by the laws of the ſtates, in which ſlavery is allowed, are perſonal property. They, therefore, on the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of thoſe laws, like horſes, cattle, and other moveables, were liable to become booty—and belonged to the enemy, as ſoon as they came into his hands. Belonging to him, he was free either to apply them to his own uſe, or to ſet them at liberty. If he did the latter, the grant was irrevocable, reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titution was impoſſible. Nothing in the laws of nations, or in thoſe of Great-Britain, will authoriſe the reſumption of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, once granted to a human being.</item>
                        <item>III. The negroes in queſtion were either taken in the courſe
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:028389_0857_0FD8EFD81DF7F770"/>of military operations, or they joined the Britiſh army upon invitation by proclamation. However diſhonourable to Great-Britain the latter may have been, as an illiberal ſpecies o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <item>IV. The ſtipulation relates to "Negroes or <hi>other property</hi> of the <hi>American</hi> inhabitants;" putting Negroes on the ſame footing with any other article. The characteriſtic of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the ſtipulation being <hi>property</hi> of <hi>American</hi> inhabitan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<p>Why did not the United States demand the ſurrender <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

The anſwer is, becauſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe would have revolved againſt ſuch a conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. No one could believe, that an indefinite ſurrender of al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>The ſilence of the United States, as to every other articl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But, to this the reply is, that a part of the clauſe manifeſtly contemplates the caſe of new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations, and provides a guard againſt it, in the promiſe, that the evacuations ſhall be made without <hi>cauſing any deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> To cauſe deſtruction is to do ſome new act of violence. This reflection deſtroys the argument drawn from the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluouſneſs of the ſtipulation in the ſenſe here given to it, and by ſhowing that it muſt have ſuch a ſenſe in one part, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes the concluſion, that the remainder of the clauſe has a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar ſenſe. The connection of the two things, in parts of one ſentence, confirms this inference.</item>

                     <p>Theſe arguments certainly have great weight, and do not admit of eaſy refutation. It is a fact, too, that the opinions of ſome of the ableſt lawyers of our own country, have, from the beginning, correſponded with the conſtruction they enforce.</p>
                     <p>It is not enough for us to be perſuaded, that ſome of the negociators, who made the peace, intended the article in our ſenſe. It is neceſſary that it ſhould be found in the inſtrument itſelf, and, from the nature of it, ought to have been expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with clearneſs and without ambiguity. If there be real am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity in ſuch a caſe, the odiouſneſs of the effect will incline the ſcale againſt us.</p>
                     <p>It does not remove the difficulty, to ſay, that compenſation for the negroes might have been a ſubſtitute for the thing.— When one party promiſes a ſpecific thing to another, nothing but the thing itſelf will ſatisfy the promiſe. The party to whom it is made cannot be required to accept in lieu of it an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent. It follows, that compenſation for the negroes would not have been a performance of the ſtipulation to forbear to carry them away; and therefore, if there be any thing odious in the ſpecific thing itſelf, the objection to the interpretation which requires it, is not done away by the idea of ſubſtituting compenſation. For the article does not admit ſuch ſubſtitution, and its ſenſe cannot be defined by what it does admit.</p>
                     <p>Some colour to our ſenſe of the article reſults from theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in the ſame clauſe, "leaving in all fortifications, the <hi>American</hi> artillery that may be therein."—But this expreſſion is not of equivalent force to that of <hi>property</hi> of <hi>American inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.</hi> —For example ſuppoſe an American ſhip to have been captured and condemned, it might ſtill be ſaid of her, in a certain ſenſe, this is an "American ſhip," alluding to the

<pb n="61" facs="unknown:028389_0860_0FD8EFDC569E0A00"/>and to refer to the latter the concluſive obligatory force and legal perfection. There is room, therefore, to ſay, that all but the mere ceſſation of hoſtilities, or for the execution of which there is no preciſe point of time fixed in the prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary articles, is referred to in the definitive treaty.</p>
                     <p>On the other hand, it may be argued, that a preliminary treaty is as much a national treaty as a definitive one, both being made by an equal and the competent authority; and that there is no good reaſon why thoſe things which are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently regulated by the preliminary, ſhould not go into im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate and complete effect, equally as if regulated by the definitive treaty; or why the latter ſhould be conſidered as any thing more than an inſtrument for adjuſting points which may have been left open by the preliminary articles, and for giving more perfect form. Accordingly, there are examples of preliminary treaties going into mutual and full execution, though never followed by definitive treaties.</p>
                     <p>But, however this queſtion may have ſtood on principle, the conduct of our government in the particular caſe has ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled it againſt us, and has completely ſanctioned the doctrine of Great-Britain.</p>
                     <p>If performance was to date from the proviſional articles, this applies as well to us to to Great-Britain. It was incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon congreſs to have notified the treaty, with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſolemnities, to the different ſtates and their citizens; to have made the recommendations ſtipulated by the fifth arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; and to have enjoined the obſervance of all thoſe things which we promiſed on our part. The nature of ſome of theſe ſtipulations rendered it particularly urgent that no time ſhould be loſt. But all was deferred till the ratification in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the definitive treaty. The 15th of January 1784, is the date of the act which attempts to carry the treaty into effect on our part. This then is a practical ſettlement by our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the principle, that performance was to date from the definitive treaty.</p>
                     <p>It is no objection to the poſition, that our ſea ports were previouſly evacuated; that was matter of mutual convenience; and though done, does not change the ſtate of <hi>ſtrict obligation</hi> between the parties. Even in the view of liberal and concilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting procedure, the prompt ſurrender of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>But our dilemma is this, if the delay of orders for evacuating the weſtern poſts, previous to the ratification of the definitive treaty, was, on the part of Great-Britain, a breach of treaty,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:028389_0861_0FD8EFDDD5F07868"/>our delay to act upon the points ſtipulated by us till after th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

To this it may be added that it was conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Great-Britain as a direct infraction of the 6th article of her treaty with us, which exempts all perſons from proſecution "by reaſon of the part they might have taken in the war."</p>
                     <p>Mr. Jefferſon, not controverting the point that the proviſions of this act were contrary to the treaty, endeavours to get rid of the inference from it, by alleging three things.—
<list>
                           <item>1ſt. That it paſſed antecedently to the treaty, and ſo could not be a violation of an act of ſubſequent data.—</item>
                           <item>2d. That the treaty was para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to the laws of the particular ſtates, and operated a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal of them.—</item>
                           <item>3d. That the exceptionable principle of this act was never ſanctioned by the courts of juſtice, and in one inſtance (the caſe of Rutgers and Waddington in the mayor's court) was over ruled.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the firſt point, it is ſufficient to anſwer, that the law continued to operate, <hi>in fact,</hi> from the time of the treaty rid the 4th of April, 1787, when there was a repeal of the exception<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>To the ſecond point, theſe obſervations may be oppoſed.</p>
                     <p>The articles of the confederation did not, like our preſent conſtitution, declare that treaties were <hi>ſupreme laws</hi> of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>and. The United States, under that ſyſtem, had no courts of their own, to expound and enforce their treaties as laws. All was to depend upon the comparative authority of laws and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>eaties, in the judgment of the ſtate courts.</p>
                     <p>The queſtion, whether treaties were paramount to, and a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>rtual repeal of antecedent laws, was a queſtion of theory, about which there was room for, and in this country did exiſt much diverſity of opinion. It is notorious, that it has been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>renuouſly maintained that however a national treaty ought, a good faith, to be concluſive on a ſtate, to induce a repeal of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ws contrary to it; yet its actual laws could not be contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by treaty, without an actual repeal by its own authority. This doctrine has been emphatically that of the party diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>And it is obſervable, that congreſs, not relying entirely up

                     <p>Additional proof of the contrary is found in the ſubſequent conduct of Virginia. On the 12th of December, 1787, the ſtate paſſed an act repealing all ſuch acts or parts of acts of the late, as had prevented, or might prevent the recovery of debts due to Britiſh ſubjects, according to the true intent of the treaty; but with this proviſo, that there ſhould be a ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the repeal, 'till the governor, by advice of council had, by proclamation, notified that Great-Britain had delivered up the poſts, and was taking meaſures for the further fulfilment of the treaty by delivering up the Negroes, or by making compenſation for them.

                     <p>The argument then, upon the whole, as to the queſtion of the firſt breach, ſtands thus—It is a great doubt whether the

If it was one, the treſpaſs act of this ſtate preceded it in date, and went into operation the very moment it was poſſible to iſſue proceſs.

The taſk of diſplaying this truth has been an unwelcome one. As long as a contrary doctrine was either a mere eſſay of polemical ſkill, or a convenient ingredient of negociation, it was natural for thoſe who thought differently of it, to prefer ſilence to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction; but when it is made the engine of great errors, of national conduct, of exceſſive pretenſions, which forbid a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable accommodation, of national difference, and endangers rupture and war, on grounds which reaſon diſapproves and prudence condemns, it becomes an indiſpenſible duty to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe its hollowneſs and fallacy.—Reſerve then would be a crime.

<pb n="70" facs="unknown:028389_0069_0FD8E76AA03C3280"/>of this independent country, is an object of ſuch GREAT and PRIMARY magnitude, that it ought not to be relinquiſhed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the relinquiſhment be clearly neceſſary to PRESERVE our HONOUR in ſome UNEQUIVOCAL point, or to avoid the ſacrifice of ſome RIGHT or INTEREST of MATERIAL and PERMANENT importance." This is the touchſtone of every queſtion which can come before us, reſpecting our foreign concerns.</p>
                     <p>As a general propoſition, ſcarcely any will diſpute it; but in the application of the rule, there is much confuſion of ideas; much falſe feeling and falſer reaſoning. The ravings of anger and pride are miſtaken for the ſuggeſtions of honor. Thus are we told in a delirium of rage, by a gentleman of South-Carolina, that our envoy ſhould have demanded an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conditional</hi> relinquiſhment of the weſtern poſts as a right; till which was granted, and until lord Grenville had given orders to lord Dorcheſter to that effect, <hi>open to be ſent to our preſident, to be by him forwarded,</hi> he ſhould not have <hi>opened his lips about the treaty. It was proſtrating the deareſt rights of freemen, and laying them proſtrate at the feet of royalty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In a caſe of inconteſtible, <hi>mutual</hi> infractions of a treaty, one of the parties is to demand, peremptorily of the other, an <hi>unconditional</hi> performance upon his part, by way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liminary and without negociation. An envoy ſent to avert war, carrying with him the cleareſt indications of a general ſolicitude of his country, that peace might be preſerved, was, at the very firſt ſtep of his progreſs, to render hoſtility inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, by exacting, not only what could not have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with, but what muſt have been rejected with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. The government of Great-Britain muſt have been the moſt abject on earth, in a caſe ſo ſituated, to have liſtened for a moment to ſuch a demand. And becauſe our envoy did not purſue this frantic courſe; did not hold the language of an IMPERIOUS BASHAW to his TREMBLING SLAVE, he is abſurdly ſtigmatiſed as having <hi>proſtrated the rights of freemen, at the foot of royalty.</hi> What are we to think of the ſtate of mind which could produce ſo extravagant a ſally? would a prudent people have been willing to have entruſted a nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation which involved their peace to the author of it? will they be willing to take him as their guide in a critical emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of their affairs?<note n="*" place="bottom">No man in the habit of thinking well, either of mr.

True honor is a rational thing. It is as diſtinguiſhable from Quixotiſm, as true courage from the ſpirit of bravo. It is poſſible for one nation to commit ſo undiſguiſed and unqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified an outrage upon another, as to render a negociation of the queſtion diſhonorable. But this ſeldom, if ever happens. In moſt caſes, it is conſiſtent with honor to precede rupture by negociation, and whenever it is, reaſon and humanity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it. Honor cannot be wounded by conſulting modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As a general rule, it is not till after it has become ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that reaſonable reparation for a clear premediated wrong cannot be obtained by an amicable adjuſtment, that honor demands a reſort to arms. In all the queſtions between us and Great-Britain, honor permitted the moderate courſe; in thoſe which regard the inexecution of the treaty of peace, there had undoubtedly been mutual faults.—It was, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, a caſe for negociation and mutual reparation. True ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, which can never be ſeparated from juſtice, even requires reparation from us to Great-Britain, as well as from her to us. The injuries we complain of in the preſent war, were alſo of a negociable kind. The firſt was bottomed on a controverted point in the laws of nations. The ſecond left open the queſtion, whether the principal injury was a deſigned act of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or a miſconſtruction of its courts. To have taken, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the imperious ground which is recommended, in place of that which was taken—would have been not to follow the admonitions of honor, but to have ſubmitted to the impulſe of paſſion and phrenzy.</p>
                     <p>So likewiſe, when it is aſſerted that war is preferable to the ſacrifice of our rights and intereſts, this, to be true, to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, muſt be underſtood of ſuch rights and intereſts as are certain, as are important, ſuch as regard the honor, ſecurity, or proſperity of our country. It is not a right diſputable, or of ſmall conſequence, it is not an intereſt temporary, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and inconſiderable, which will juſtify, in our ſituation, an appeal to arms.</p>
                     <p>Nations ought to calculate as well as individuals; to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare evils; and to prefer the leſſer to the greater; to act otherwiſe, is to act unreaſonably; thoſe who counſel it, are impoſtors or madmen.</p>
                     <p>Theſe reflections are of a nature to lead to a right judgment of the conduct of our envoy in the plan of adjuſtment to which he has given his aſſent.</p>
                     <p>Three objects, as has appeared, were to be aimed at, on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:028389_0071_0FD8E76E5EE20D38"/>of the United States. 1ſt, Compenſation for Negroes car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away. 2d, Surrender of the Weſtern Poſts. 3d, Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation for ſpoliation during the exiſting war.</p>
                     <p>Two of theſe objects, and theſe in every view the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, have been provided for; how fully will be examined hereafter. One of them has been given up (to wit) compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation for the Negroes.</p>
                     <p>It has been ſhown, as I truſt, to the conviction of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate men, that the claim of compenſation for the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, is, in point of right, a very doubtful one; in point of intereſt, it certainly falls under the deſcription of partial and inconſiderable; affecting in no reſpect, the honor or ſecurity of the nation, and incapable of having a ſenſible influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its proſperity. The pecuniary value of the object is, in a national ſcale, trifling,</p>
                     <p>Not having before me the proper documents, I can only ſpeak from memory. But I do not fear to be materially miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in ſtating that the whole number carried away, ſo aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained as to have afforded evidence for a claim of compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was ſhort of 3000 perſons, of whom about 1300 were of ſixteen years and upwards, men, women, and children. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting theſe at an average of 150 dollars per head, which is a competent price, the amount would be 450, 000 dollars, and not two or three millions, as has been pretended.</p>
                     <p>It is a fact, which I aſſert on the beſt authority, that our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy made every effort in this power to eſtabliſh our conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the article relating to this ſubject, and to obtain compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; and that he did not relinquiſh it, till he became con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that to inſiſt upon it would defeat the purpoſe of his miſſion, and leave the controverſy between the two countries unſettled.</p>
                     <p>Finding, at the ſame time, that the two other points in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute could be reaſonably adjuſted, is there any one who will be raſh enough to affirm, that he ought to have broken off the negociation on account of the difficulty about the Negroes? Yes! there are men, who are thus inconſiderate and intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate! But will a ſober reflecting people ratify their ſentence?</p>

                  <p>WHAT would ſuch a people have ſaid to our envoy, had he returned with this abſurd tale in his mouth! "Countrymen! I could have obtained the ſurrende of your poſts, and an adequate proviſion for the reparation of your loſſes by unjuſt captures—I could have terminated your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy with Great Britain, and ſecured the continuance of your peace, but for one obſtacle, a refuſal to compenſate for the negroes carried away; on this point the Britiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment maintained a conſtruction of the treaty different from ours, and adhered to it with inflexibility. I confeſs, that there appeared to be much doubt concerning the true conſtruction: I confeſs, alſo, that the object was of inconſiderable value. Yet it made a part of our claims; and I thought the hazards of war preferable to a renunciation of it."</p>
                  <p>What would his adverſaries have replied to him on ſuch an occaſion? No ridicule would have been too ſtrong, no reproach too bitter. Their triumph would have been complete: for he would have been deſervedly left without advocate, without apologiſt.</p>
                  <p>It cannot admit of a ſerious doubt, that the affair of the negroes, was too queſtionable in point of right, too inſignificant in point of intereſt, to have been ſuffered to be an impediment to the immenſe objects which were to be promoted by an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation of differences acceptable in other reſpects. There was no general principle of national right or policy to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced. No conſideration of honor forbid the renunciation, every calculation of intereſt invited to it. The evils of war for one month would outweigh the advantage, if at the end of it there was a certainty of attainment.</p>
                  <p>But was war the alternative? Yes, war or diſgrace.</p>
                  <p>The United States and Great Britain had been brought to iſſue. The recent ſpoliations on our commerce, ſuperadded to the evils of a protracted Indian war, connected with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the weſtern poſts, and accompanied with indications of a deſign to contract our boundaries, obſtructing the courſe of our ſettlements and the enjoyment of private rights, and producing ſerious and growing diſcontent in our weſtern country, rendered it indiſpenſable, that there ſhould be a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:028389_0075_0FD8E7774E425460"/>of old differences, and a reparation of new wrongs; or, that the ſword ſhould vindicate our rights.</p>
                  <p>This was certainly, and with reaſon, the general ſenſe of our country, when our envoy left it. There are many indications that it was the opinion of our government; and it is to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, that our envoy underſtood the alternative to be as has been ſtated.</p>
                  <p>Indeed what elſe could be contemplated? after the depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which had been committed upon our commerce, after the ſtrong ſenſibility which had been diſcovered upon the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It is curious to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>Even a ſtile of politeneſs in our envoy has been conſtrued to his diſadvantage. Becauſe he did not miſtake ſtrut for dignity, and rudeneſs for ſpirit; becauſe he did not, by petulence and aſperity, inliſt the pride of the Britiſh court againſt the ſucceſs of his miſſion, he is repreſented as having humiliated himſelf and his nation. It is forgotten that mildneſs in the manner, and ſirmneſs in the thing, are moſt compatible with true digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and almoſt always go further than harſhneſs and ſtatelineſs.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſitions that more could be done by diſplaying, what is called, greater ſpirit, are not warranted by facts. It would be extremely imprudent on that baſis, to truſt ourſelves to a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther experiment—to the immenſe viciſſitudes in the affairs of Europe, which from moment to moment may eſſentially vary the relative ſituations of the contending parties. If there ever was a ſtate of things which demanded extraordinary circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, and forbade a ſpirit of adventure, it is that of the United States at the exiſting juncture, viewed in connection with the preſent very ſingular and incalculable poſture of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</p>
                  <p>But it is aſked, to avoid S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ylla, may we not run upon Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rybdis? —If the treaty ſhould preſerve our peace with Britain, may it not interrupt it with France?—I anſwer, that to me there appears no room for apprehenſion. It will be ſhewn in the courſe of the diſcuſſion, that the treaty interferes in no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular with our engagements to France, and will make <hi>no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration whatever in the ſtate of things between us and her,</hi> except as to the ſelling prizes in our ports, which, not being required by treaty, was originally permitted merely becauſe there was no law to forbid it, and which being confined to France was of very queſtionable propriety on the principles of neutrality, and has been a ſource of diſſatisfaction to the other belligerent powers. This being the caſe, no cauſe of umbrage is given to France by the treaty, and is as contrary to her intereſt as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, wantonly to ſeek a quarrel with us. Proſtrate indeed were our ſituation, if we could not, without offending France, make a treaty with another power, which merely tended to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh controverſy, and to regulate the rules of commercial intercourſe, and this not only without violating any duty to France, but without giving any preference to another. It is aſtoniſhing that thoſe who affect ſo much nicety about national
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:028389_0077_0FD8E77A593798D0"/>honor, do not feel the extreme humiliation of ſuch an idea. As to the denomination of alliance with Great Britain which has been given to the treaty, it is an inſult to the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the people, to call it by ſuch a name. There is not a tittle of it which warrants the appellation.</p>

                  <p>THERE is one more objection to the treaty for what it does not do, which requires to be noticed. This is a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> omiſſion to provide againſt the impreſſment of our ſeamen.</p>
                  <p>It is certain that our trade has ſuffered embarraſſments in this reſpect, and that there have been abuſes which have operated very oppreſſively upon our ſeamen; and all will join in the wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> that they could have been guarded againſt in future by the treaty.</p>
                  <p>But it is eaſier to deſire this, than to ſee how it could have been done. A general ſtipulation againſt the impreſſment of our ſeamen would have been nugatory, if not derogatory. Our right to an exemption is perfect by the laws of nations, and a contrary right is not even pretended by Great Britain. The difficulty has been, and is, to fix a rule of evidence, by which to diſcriminate our ſeamen from theirs, and by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> crimination to give ours protection, without covering theirs in our ſervice. It happens that the two nations ſpeak the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ame language, and in every exterior circumſtance cloſely reſemble each other; that many of the natives of Great Britain and Ireland are among our citizens, and that others, without being properly our citizens, are employed in our veſſels.</p>
                  <p>Every body knows, that the ſafety of Great Britain depends upon her marine. This was never more emphatically the cafe, than in the war in which ſhe is now engaged. Her very e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence as an independent power, ſeems to reſt on a maritime ſuperiority.</p>
                  <p>In this ſituation, can we be ſurpriſed that there are difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in bringing her to conſent to any arrangement which would enable us, by receiving her ſeamen into our em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, to detain them from her ſervice? Unfortunateds; there can be deviſed no method of protecting our ſeamen which does not involve that danger to her. Language and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, inſtead of being a guide, as between other nations, are
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:028389_0078_0FD8E77BD724C248"/>between us and Great Britain, ſources of miſtake and decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The moſt familiar experience in the ordinary affairs of ſociety, proves, that the oaths of parties intereſted cannot be fully relied upon. Certificates of citizenſhip, by officers of one party, would be too open to the poſſibility of colluſion and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, to expect that the other would admit them to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive. If inconcluſive, there muſt be a diſcretion to the other party which would deſtroy their efficacy.</p>
                  <p>In whatever light they may be viewed, there will be found an intrinſic difficulty in deviſing a rule of evidence, ſaſe for both parties, and conſequently, in eſtabliſhing one by treaty. No nation would readily admit a rule which would make it depend on the good faith of another, and the integrity of its agents, whether her ſeamen, in time of war, might be drawn from her ſervice, and transferred to that of a neutral power. Such a rule between Great Britain and us, would be peculiarly dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, on account of circumſtances, and would facilitate a transfer of ſeamen from one party to another. Great Britain has accordingly perſeveringly declined any definitive arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the ſubject; notwithſtanding earneſt and reiterated efforts of our government.</p>
                  <p>When we conſider candidly the peculiar difficulties which various circumſtances of ſimilitude, between the people of the two countries, oppoſe to a ſatisfactory arrangement, and that to the belligerent party, it is a queſtion of <hi>national ſafety,</hi> to the neutral party a queſtion of commercial convenience and individual ſecurity, we ſhall be the leſs diſpoſed to think the want of ſuch a proviſion as our wiſhes would dictate, a blemiſh in the treaty.</p>
                  <p>The truth ſeems to be, that from the nature of the thing, it is matter of neceſſity to leave it to occaſional and temporary expedients—to the effects of ſpecial interpoſitions from time to time, to procure the correction of abuſes; and if the abuſe becomes intolerable, to the <hi>ultima ratio;</hi> the good faith of the parties, and the motives which they have to reſpect the rights of each other, and to avoid cauſes of offence, and vigilance in noting and remonſtrating againſt the irregularities which are committed, are probably the only peaceable ſureties of which the caſe is ſuſceptible.</p>
                  <p>Our miniſter plenipotentiary, Mr. Pinckney, it is well known, has long had this matter in charge, and has ſtrenuouſly exerted himſelf to have it placed upon ſome acceptable ſooting; but his endeavours have been unſucceſsful, further than to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate the evil by ſome additional checks, and by drawing the attention of the Britiſh government to the obſervance of more
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:028389_0079_0FD8E77D9ABD65E0"/>caution. A more ſenſible effect of our repreſentations has been lately experienced; and with attention and vigilance, that effect may be continued, and perhaps increaſed. But there is reaſon to ſear that it would conſtantly be found impracticable to eſtabliſh an efficacious conventional guard.</p>
                  <p>I proceed now to the examination of the ſeveral articles in the treaty, in the order in which they ſtand.</p>
                  <p>The firſt contains merely a general declaration that there ſhall be peace and friendihip between the contracting parties, the countries and people of each, without exception of perſons or places.</p>
                  <p>One would have imagined that this article, at leaſt, would have eſcaped a formal objection; however it might have been ſecretly viewed as the moſt ſinful of all, by thoſe who pant after war and enmity between the two countries. Nothing but the fact could have led to a farmiſe that it was poſſible for it to have been deemed exceptionable, and nothing can better diſplay the rage for objection, which actuates the adverſaries of the treaty, than their having invented one againſt ſo inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent a proviſion.</p>
                  <p>But the committeee appointed by a meeting at Charleſton, (South Carolina) hare ſagaciouſly diſcovered, that this article permits "the unconditional return to our country of all perſons who were proſcribed during the late war."</p>
                  <p>With all but men determined to be diſſatisſied, it would be a ſufficient anſwer to ſuch an objection to ſay, that this article is a formula in almoſt every treaty on record, and that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence attributed to it was never before dreamt of, though other nations beſides ourſelves have had their proſcriptions and their baniſhments.</p>
                  <p>But this is not all—our treaty of peace with Great Britain in 1783, has an equivalent ſlipulation in theſe words (article 6) "there ſhall be a firm and perpetual peace between his Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic majeſty and the ſaid ſtates, and between the ſubjects of the one, and the citizens of the other." In calling this an equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſtipulation, I ſpeak with reference to the objection which is made. The argument to ſupport that objection would be to this effect; "Exiles and criminals are regarded as within the peace of a country; but the people of each are, by this article, placed within the peace of the other; therefore proſcribed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are reſtored to the peace of the United States, and ſo loſe the character of exiles and criminals." Hence the argument will turn upon the word "peace"—the word "friendſhip" will have no influence upon the queſtion. In other reſpects there is no difference, in ſubſtance, between the two articles. For the
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:028389_0080_0FD8E7819E906EB0"/>terms "people," "ſubjects," "citizens," as uſed in the two treaties, are ſynonimous. If, therefore, the laſt treaty ſtipulates that there ſhall be peace between the governments, countries, and people of the two nations, the firſt ſtipulates what is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, that there ſhall be peace between the two governments, and the ſubjects and citizens of each. The additional words, without exception of perſons and places, can make no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, being merely ſurpluſage If A ſays to B, "I will give you all the money in this purſe," the giſt is as complete as if he had ſaid, "I give you all the money in this purſe, without exception of a ſingle dollar."</p>
                  <p>But the object of the ſtipulation, and the ſubject of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, have no relation to each other.—National ſtipulations are to be conſidered in the ſenſe of the laws of nations. Peace, in the ſenſe of thoſe laws, defines a ſtate which is oppoſite to WAR. Peace, in the ſenſe of the municipal laws, defines a ſtate which is oppoſite to that of crimm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lity. They are, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, different things; and a ſubject of Great Britain, by committing a crime, may put himſelf out of the peace of our government, in the ſenſe of our municipal laws, while there might be perfect peace with him, in the ſenſe of the laws of nations; and <hi>vice verſa,</hi> there might be war with him, in the ſenſe of the laws of nations, and peace in that of the munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal laws.</p>
                  <p>The puniſhment of a ſubject of Great Britain as a felon, would certainly not conſtitute a ſtate of war between the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, nor interfere with the peace which is ſtipulated by this article; though it is declared that it ſhall <hi>be inviolable,</hi> and might as well be affirmed to prevent the puniſhment of future, as of former criminals.</p>
                  <p>But who, in the contemplation of the laws of the reſpective ſtates, are the proſcribed perſons? they muſt have been under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to have been ſubjects or citizens of the ſtates which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed them—conſequently cannot be preſumed to be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in an article which ſlipulates peace between the nations and their reſpective citizens.</p>
                  <p>This is not a ſtipulation of peace between a nation and its own citizens; nor can the idea of expatriation be admitted to go ſo far as to deſtroy the relation of citizen, as regards ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nability for a crime. To this purpoſe, at leaſt, the offender muſt remain a citizen.</p>
                  <p>There can hardly have been a time when a treaty was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between two nations, when one or the other had not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iled criminals or ſugutives from juſtice, which it would have been unwilling to remilate.

                  <p>It follows that the objection which has been taken to this article is wholly without foundation.

                  <p>This article, which accompliſhes a primary object of our envoy's miſſion, and one of primary importance to the United States, has been as much clamoured againſt as if it had made a formal ceſſion of the poſts to Great Britain. On this point an uncommon degree of art has been exerted, and with no ſmall ſucceſs. The value of the principal thing obtained has been put out of ſight by a miſrepreſentation of incidental cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>
                  <p>But the fact is, nevertheleſs, that an object has been accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, of vaſt conſequence to our country. The moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant <hi>deſiderata</hi> in our concerns with foreign powers are, the poſſeſſion of the weſtern poſts, and a participation in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation of the river Miſſiſſippi. More or fewer of commercial privileges are of vaſtly inferior moment. The force of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances will do all we can reaſonably wiſh in this reſpect; and, in a ſhort time, without any ſteps that may convulſe our trade or endanger our tranquillity, will carry us to our goal.</p>
                  <p>The recovery of the weſtern poſts will have many important conſequences. It will extinguiſh a ſource of controverſy with Great Britain, which, at a period, not diſtant, muſt have inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly involved the two countries in a war, and the thing was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming every day, more and more urgent. It will enable us effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to controul the hoſtilities of the northern and weſtern Indians, and in ſo doing will have a material influence on the ſouthern tribes. It will therefore tend to reſcue the country from what is at preſent its greateſt ſcourge, Indian wars. When we conſider that theſe wars have, four years paſt, taken an extra million annually from our revenue, we cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of the importance of terminating that ſource of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe. This million turned to the redemption of our debt, would contribute to complete its extinquiſhment in about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years.<note n="*" place="bottom">This is a rough calculation, but it cannot materially err.</note> The benefits of tranquillity to our frontier, exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its inhabitants from the complieated horrors of ſavage war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:028389_0083_0FD8E78A2771E298"/>ſpeak too loudly to our humanity, as well as to our policy, to need a commentary.</p>
                  <p>The advantages of the recovery of the poſts do not ſtop here; an extenſion of trade is to be added to the catalogue. This, however, need only be mentioned at this time, as it will come again into view in conſidering the third article.</p>
                  <p>But two conſequences, not commonly adverted to, require particular notice in this place.</p>
                  <p>There is juſt ground of ſuſpicion, corroborated by various concurring circumſtances, that Great Britain has entertained the project of contracting our boundaries to the Ohio. This has appeared in Canada—at the Britiſh garriſons—at the Indian towns—at Philadelphia, and at London. The ſurrender of the poſts for ever cuts up by the roots, this pernicious project. The whole of our weſtern intereſts are immediately and deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the queſtion.</p>
                  <p>The harmonious and permanent connection of our weſten with our Atlantic country, materially depends on our poſſeſſion of the weſtern poſts. Already had great diſcontent been engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in that country by their detention. That diſcontent was increaſing and rankling daily. It was actually one of the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the inſurrection in the weſtern parts of Pennſylva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>. While the poſts remained in the hands of Great Britain, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous tamperings with the inhabitants of that country were to be apprehended—a community of views between Great Britain and Spain might have taken place, and by force and ſedition, events formidable to our general union might have been hazarded. The diſpoſition or prevention of that commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of views, is a point of the greateſt moment in our ſyſtem of national policy. It preſſes us to terminate differences, and extinguiſh miſonderſtandings with Great Britain;—it urges <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s to improve the favorable moment, and ſtamps with the charge of madneſs, the efforts to let go the hold which the treaty, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> mutually ratified, would give us.</p>
                  <p>Whoever will caſt his eye upon the map of the United States, will ſurvey the poſition of the weſtern poſts, their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations to our weſtern waters, and their general bearings upon our weſtern country; and is at the ſame time capable of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reſlections, which an accurate view of the ſubject ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts, will diſcover multiplied confirmations of the poſition, that the poſſeſſion of thoſe poſts by us, has an intimate connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the preſervation of union between our weſtern and Atlantic territories; and whoever can appreciate the immenſe miſchiefs of a diſunion, will feel the prodigious value of the acquaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o ſuch a man, the queſtion may be confidently
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:028389_0084_0FD8E78B90E3B330"/>put: Is there any thing in the treaty conceded by us to Great Britain, to be placed in competition with this ſingle acquiſition? The anſwer could not ſail to be in the negative.</p>
                  <p>But it is ſaid by way of objection, that admitting the poſts will be ſurrendered at the time ſtipulated, it is no acquiſition by this treaty: it is only the enjoyment of a right which was ſecured by the treaty of peace.</p>
                  <p>With as much good ſenſe might it be ſaid, that the ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of reparation for the ſpoliation of our property, or even immediate actual reparation, if it had been obtained, was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing gained; becauſe the laws of nations gave us a right to ſuch reparation; and it might in this way be proved to have been impoſſible for our envoy to have effected any thing uſeful or meritorious.</p>
                  <p>Let us ſee what is the real ſtate of the caſe. Great Britain had engaged by the treaty of peace, to ſurrender the weſtern poſts <hi>with all convenient ſpeed;</hi> but without fixing a preciſe time. For the cauſe, or on the pretext of our not having complied with the treaty on our part, eſpecially in not removing the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments which the antecedent laws of particular ſtates, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the recovery of Britiſh debts, ſhe delayed, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards refuſed to make the ſurrender; and when our envoy left this country, there was too much appearance of an intention on her part, to detain them indefinitely, and this after having actually kept them ten years. The treaty of peace was conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in this particular ſuſpended, if not ſuperſeded. It was either to be reinſtated by a new agreement, or enforced by arms. The firſt our envoy has effected; he has brought Great Britain to abandon the diſpute, and to fix a preciſe, determinate time when, at furtheſt, the poſts are to be delivered up. It is therefore to this new agreement, that we ſhall owe the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, and it is of courſe, entitled to the merit of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obtained them; it is a poſitive ingredient in its value, which cannot be taken from it; and it may be added, that this is the firſt time that the merit of procuring, by negociation, <hi>reſtitution</hi> of a <hi>right withheld,</hi> was ever denied to the inſtrument which procured it.</p>
                  <p>But the picture given of the ſituation of Great Britain, to warrant the inferences which are drawn, is exaggerated and falſe. It cannot be denied that ſhe is triumphant on the ocean; that the acquiſitions which ſhe has made upon France, are hitherto greater than thoſe which France has made upon her. If, on the one hand, ſhe owes an immenſe debt, on the other ſhe poſſeſſes in immenſe credit, which there is no ſymptom of being i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>paited.—Britiſh credit has become, in a Britiſh mind,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:028389_0085_0FD8E78D437A2EB8"/>an article of faith, and is no longer an object of reaſon. How long it may laſt, how far it may go, is incalculable. But it is evident, that it ſtill affords prodigious reſources, and that it is likely for ſome time to come, to continue to afford them. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> addition to this, it is a well aſcertained fact, that her govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment poſſeſſes, internally, as much vigor, and has as much national ſupport, as it perhaps ever had at any former period <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Alarmed by the unfortunate exceſſes in France, moſt men of property cling to the government, and carry with them the great bulk of the nation, almoſt the whole of the farming intereſt, and much the greateſt proportion of other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious claſſes. Her manufactures, though probably wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the war, are ſtill in a comparatively flouriſhing condition. They ſuffice not only for her own ſupply, but for the full <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

It is no light circumſtance in the eſtimate of her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="unknown:028389_0086_0FD8E78F4F012408"/>
This, if offered only to ſhow that there is no probability that the enemies of France can ſucceed in the orginal object of the war againſt her, or can diveſt her of her acquiſitions on the continent, has all the force that may be deſired to be given to it; but when it is uſed to prove that the ſituation of Great Britain is ſo deſperate and humbled as to oblige her to receive from France, or the United States, any conditions which either of them may think fit to impoſe, the argument is carried infinitely too far. It is one thing for a country to be in a poſture not to receive the law from others, and a very different thing for her to be in a ſituation which obliges others to receive the law from her, and what is ſtill ſtronger, from all her friends. France evidently cannot annoy Ruſſia—ſhe cannot, without great difficulty, from their geographical poſition, make any further acquiſitions upon the territories of Auſtria. Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and her poſſeſſions are eſſentially ſafe, while ſhe maintains a decided maritime ſuperiority. As long as this is the caſe, even ſuppoſing her abandoned by all her allies, ſhe never can be in the ſituation which is pretended by the oppoſers of the treaty.</p>
                  <p>But in deſcribing the ſituation of France, only one ſide of the medal is preſented. There is another ſide far leſs flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening, and which, in order to come to a juſt concluſion, muſt be impartially viewed.</p>
                  <p>If the allies of Great Britain are fatigued and exhauſted, France cannot be in a better condition. The efforts of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in proportion to intrinſic reſources, have, no doubt, been much greater than thoſe of the former. It is a conſequence from this, phyſically certain, that France muſt be ſtill more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued and exhauſted, even than her adverſaries. Her acquiſitions cannot materially vary this concluſion: the low countries, long the theatre of the war, muſt have been pretty well emptied be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they fell into her hands. Holland is an artificial power; her life and ſtrength were in her credit; this periſhed with her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction. Accordingly the ſuccours extracted from her, compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſcale of the war, have been inſignificant.</p>
                  <p>But it is conjectured, that as much has not been done as might have been done; that reſtitution of the poſts has not been procured, but only a promiſe to reſtore them at a remote period, in exchange for a former promiſe, which had been violated. That there is no good ground of reliance upon the fulfilment of this new promiſe, for the performance of which there ought to have been ſome ſurety or guarantee. That the reſtitution of the poſts ought to have been accompanied with indemnification for the detention, and for the expenſes of the Indian wars which have been occaſioned by that deten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:028389_0087_0FD8E792DDC51FD0"/>and by the inſtigation of Britiſh intrigue. That it was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to go to war than to relinquiſh our claim to ſuch indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification; or if our preſent circumſtances did not recommend this, it was better to wait till it was more convenient to us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> enforce our claims, than to give them up.—Theſe are the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations by which this part of the treaty is arraigned. Let us ſee if they are the random effuſions of enthuſiaſm, or the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional dictates of ſound policy.</p>
                  <p>As to the ſuggeſtion, that more might have been done than was done, it muſt of neceſſity be more conjecture and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. If the picture given of the ſituation of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, was better juſtified by facts than it is, it would not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that the ſuggeſtion is true; for the thing would depend not on the real ſituation of the country, but on the opinion entertained of it by its own adminiſtration, on the perſonal character of the prince and of his council; on the degree i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> which they were influenced by pride and paſſion, or by reaſon. The hypotheſis, that the diſpoſitions of a government are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable with its ſituation, it as fallacious a one as can be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained. It is to ſuppoſe, contrary to every day's experience, that cabinets are always wiſe. It is, on the part of thoſe who draw the inference, to ſuppoſe, that a cabinet, the moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, raſh, and fooliſh, of Europe, is at the ſame time mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and prudent enough to act according to the true ſituation of the country. Who of our enthuſiaſts, reaſoning from his view of the abaſed condition of Great-Britain, has not long ſince imagined that ſhe ought to be on her knees to France, ſuing for mercy and forgiveneſs?

But the cant phraſes of party cannot alter the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of truth—nor will they prevent the people of the United States from liſtening impartially to it, or from diſcerning that it is a mark of fidelity to their intereſts, to counteract miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, by placing facts fairly before them, and a duty which they owe to themſelves, and which they cannot omit to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form without betraying their own intereſts, to receive them candidly, and weigh them maturely.</p>
                  <p>The concluſion is, that all thoſe highly-charged declamations which deſcribe Great Britain to us as vanquiſhed and humbled; as ready to paſs under the yoke at command, and to ſubmit to any conditions which we may think fit to preſcribe, are either the chimeras of over-heated imaginations, or the ſabrication of impoſtors; and if liſtened to, can have no other effect than to inſpire a deluſive preſumption, and a dangerous temerity.</p>
                  <p>But to judge the better of the extravagance of theſe decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, it will be uſeful to go back to the periods when the negociation began and ended. Our envoy arrived in England and entered upon the buſineſs of his miſſion, at the moment when there was a general elation on account of the naval victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gained by Lord Howe, and previous to thoſe important ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, which have terminated in the conqueſt of Holland; and the treaty was concluded by the 19th of Novemver laſt, prior to the laſt mentioned event, and the defection of the king of Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The poſture of things at the time it was in negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not at this time, is the ſtandard by which to try its merits; and it may be obſerved, that it is probable the negoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation received its firſt impreſſion, and even its general outline anterior to the principal part of the diſaſters ſuſtained by the coaleſced powers in the courſe of the laſt campaign.</p>
                  <p>It may not be improper to add, that if we credit the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of our envoy, Great Britain manifeſted ſimilar diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions with regard to the treaty at the commencement as at the cloſe of the negociation: whence it will follow, that too much has been attributed in this country to the victories of France.</p>

                  <p>ONE of the particulars, in which our envoy is alleged to have fallen ſhort of what might or ought to have been done, reſpects the time for the ſurrender of the weſtern poſts. It is alleged, that there ought either to have been an immediate ſurrender, or ſome guarantee or ſurety for the performance of the new promiſe. Both parts of the alternative preſuppoſe that Great Britain was to have no will upon the ſubject; that no circumſtances of ſecurity or convenience to her were to be conſulted; that our envoy was not to negociate, but to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. How unſubſtantial the foundation on which this courſe of proceeding is recommended, has been already developed.</p>
                  <p>The fact was, that our envoy preſſed an early evacuation of the poſts; but there was an inflexible adherence, on the other ſide, to the term limited in the treaty. The reaſons underſtood to have been aſſigned for it, were to this effect, viz. That ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the courſe of the Indian trade, it was cuſtomary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er period than was propoſed to be fixed for the evacuation; that the impreſſion which the ſurrender of all the poſts to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican garriſons might make on the minds of the Indians, could not be foreſeen; that there was the greateſt reaſon for caution, as, on a former occaſion, it had been intimated to them by public agents of the United ſtates, that they had been <hi>forſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     </hi> and <hi>given up</hi> by the Britiſh government; that the protection promiſed on our part, however ſincere, and however competent in other reſpects, might not be ſufficient in the firſt inſtance to prevent the embarraſſment which might enſue; that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>There is ground to believe, that there were repreſentatie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And it may not be uſeleſs to obſerve, as explanatory to the reaſons given, that in fact it is the courſe of the trade <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

What was to be done in this caſe? Was the negociation to break off, or was the delay to be admitted? The laſt was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by our envoy; and the preference was rightly judged.</p>
                  <p>The conſequence of breaking off the negociation has been ſtated. No reaſonable man will doubt, that delay was prefera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to war, if there be good ground of reliance, that the ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation will be fulfilled at the appointed time. Let us calmly examine this point.</p>
                  <p>The argument againſt it, is drawn from the breach of the former promiſe. To be authorized to preſs this argument, we ought to be ſure that all was right on our part.—After what has been offered on this ſubject, are we ſtill convinced that this was the caſe? Are we able to ſay, that there was nothing in our conduct which furniſhed a ground for that of Great Britain? Has it not been ſhown to be a fact, that, from the arrival of the proviſional articles in this country, till after the ratification thereof, by the definitive treaty, acts of ſtates inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting the recovery of Britiſh debts, and other acts militating againſt the treaty, continued in operation? Can we doubt, that ſubjects of Great Britain, affected by theſe acts, carried com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints to the ears of their government? Can we wonder, if they made ſerious impreſſions there, if they produced diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and diſtruſt? Is it very extraordinary, if they excited the idea of detaining the poſts as a pledge, till there were better indications on our part? Is it ſurpriſing, if the continuance of theſe acts, and the addition of others, which were new and poſitive breaches of the treaty, prolonged the detention of the poſts?—</p>
                  <p>In fine, was the delay in ſurrendering ſo entirely deſtitute of cauſe, ſo unequivocal a proof of a perſidious character, as to juſtify the concluſion, that no future dependence can be made on the promiſes of the Britiſh government? Diſcerning men will not haſtily ſubſcribe to this concluſion.</p>
                  <p>Mutual charges of breach of faith are not uncommon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween nations: yet this does not prevent their making new ſtipulations with each other, and relying upon their perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. The argument from the breach of one promiſe, if real, to the breach of every other, is not ſupported by experience; and if adopted as a general rule, would multiply, infinitely, the impediments to accord and agreement among nations.</p>
                  <p>The truth is, that though nations will too often evade their promiſes on colourable pretexts, yet few are ſo profligate as to do it without ſuch pretexts. In clear caſes, ſelf-intereſt dictates a regard to the obligations of good faith: nor is there any thing in the hiſtory of Great Britain which warrants the opinion,
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:028389_0091_0FD8BE8E88FD9320"/>that ſhe is more unmindful than other nations, of her character for good faith.</p>
                  <p>Yet ſhe muſt be ſo, and in an extreme degree, if ſhe be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of breaking, without real cauſe, a <hi>ſecond</hi> promiſe on the <hi>ſame</hi> point, after the termination, by a new treaty, of an old diſpute concerning it, and this too on the baſis of mutual repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. It would indicate a deſtitution of principle, a contempt of character, much beyond the uſual meaſure, and to an extent which it may be affirmed is entirely improbable.</p>
                  <p>It is a circumſtance of ſome moment in the queſtion, that the ſecond promiſe is free from the vagueneſs of the firſt, a to the time of execution—It is not to be performed <hi>with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> convenient ſpeed,</hi> but by a day certain, which cannot be exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This would give point to violation, and render it unequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal.</p>
                  <p>Another argument, againſt the probability of performance has been deduced from the ſuppoſed deficiency of good reaſon for the delay, which is repreſented as evidence of want of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>But we have very ſtrong holds, for the performance of this promiſe, upon the intereſt of Great Britain: 1ſt. The intereſt which every nation has, in not entirely forfeiting its reputation for honor and fidelity. 2d. The intereſt which reſults from the correlative ſtipulation with regard to the indemnification for the Britiſh debts, a point upon which there will be no inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable mercantile ſenſibility. 3d. The intereſt of preſerving peace with this country, the interruption of which, after all that has paſſed, could not fail to attend the non-ſurrender of the poſts at the ſtipulated time.</p>
                  <p>It is morally certain, that circumſtances will every day add ſtrength to this laſt motive.—Time has already done much for us, and will do more. Every hour's continuance of the war in Europe, muſt neceſſarily add to the inconveniencies of a rupture with this country, and to the motives which Great Britain muſt feel, to avoid an increaſe of the number of her enemies, in deſire peace, and, if obtained, to preſerve it.</p>
                  <p>The enemies of the treaty, upon their own calculations, can hardly diſpute, that if the war continues another year after the preſent, the probable ſituation of Great Britain, will be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete ſecurity, for her compliance with her promiſe, to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the poſts.

We ſhould then be where we were before the treaty, with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of having ſtrengthened the juſtice of our cauſe, by removing every occaſion of reproach, which the infractions of the treaty of peace may have furniſhed againſt us.</p>
                  <p>Two other particulars, in which this part of the treaty is ſuppoſed to be defective, regard the want of indemnification
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:028389_0094_0FD8E7A450BBF368"/>for the detention of the poſts, and for the expenſes of Indian wars.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who make the objection, may be ſafely challenged to produce precedents of ſimilar indemnifications, unleſs impoſed by <hi>conquering</hi> powers on the vanquiſhed, or by powers of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearing ſtrength upon thoſe which were too weak to diſpute the logic of ſuperior force. If this were the real ſituation of the United States and Great Britain, then is the treaty inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſably faulty; but if the parties were to treat and agree as equal powers, then is the pretenſion extravagant and impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable. The reſtitution of the ſpecific thing detained, is all that was to be expected, and, it may be added, it is all that was ever really expected on the part of this country, ſo far as we may reaſon either from official acts or informal expreſſions of the public opinion.</p>
                  <p>In eaſes where clear injuries are done, affecting objects of known or eaſily aſcertained values, pecuniary compenſation may be expected to be obtained by negociation; but it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that it will be impoſſible to cite an example of compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation ſo obtained, in a caſe in which territory has been with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held on a diſpute of title, or as a hoſtage for ſome other claim (as, in the preſent inſtance, for ſecuring the performance of the 4th article of the treaty of peace.) The recovery of the territory withheld is the uſual ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>The want of a rule to adjuſt conſequential damages, is, in ſuch caſes, a very great difficulty. In the inſtance under diſtaffion, this difficulty would be peculiarly great.—The poſts are, for the moſt part, in a wilderneſs. There are but two of them which have any adjacent ſettlements; Point-au-fer, or Dutchman's point, to which a part of a tract of land, called Cald well's Manor, with a few inhabitants, has been claimed as appurtenant; and Detroit, which has a ſettlement in the town and neighbourhood of between two and three thouſand ſouls. In the vicinity of the other poſts, on our ſide, there is ſcarcely an inhabitant. It follows, that very little damage could be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated either upon the loſs of revenue from, or of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of trade with, the ſettlements in the vicinity of the poſts. The trade of the Indians within our limits would conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be the baſis of the claim of compenſation.—But here the ignorance or ſpirit of exaggeration of the opponents of the treaty has been particularly exemplified. The annual lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Now it is a fact well aſcertained, that the mean value of the whole exports from Canada in peltries (which conſtitute the

                  <p>The reaſonableneſs of indemnification for the expenſes of Indian wars, independent of the unuſual nature of the claim, might have been matter of endleſs debate. We might have been told, that the Indians aſcribe thoſe wars to pretenſions upon their lands, by virtue of treaties with the former govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the United States, impoſed by violence, or contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with partial and inadequate repreſentations of their nation —that our own public records witneſs, that the proceedings of our agents, at ſome of thoſe treaties, were far from unexcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable —that the wars complained of are to be attributed to errors in our former policy, or miſmanagement of our public agents, not to the detention of the poſts—that it muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blematical how much of the duration or expenſes of thoſe wars are chargeable upon that detention—and, that the poſts having been detained by way of ſecurity for the performance of the article reſpecting debts, there was no reſponſibility for collateral and caſual damages. Had we reſorted to the charge of their having inſtigated or prompted thoſe wars, they would have denied the charge, as they have repeatedly done before; and, though we might have been able to adduce circumſtances of ſuſpicion againſt them, they would have conteſted their validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and force, and, whether guilty or not, would have thought their honor concerned in avoiding the moſt diſtant conceſſion of having participated in ſo improper a buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>In every view, therefore, the claim for indemnification was a hopeleſs one; and to inſiſt upon it would have anſwered no other purpoſe than to render an amicable adjuſtment impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. No Britiſh miniſter would have dared to go to a Britiſh parliament to aſk proviſion for ſuch an expenditure. What, then, was to be done? Were we now or hereafter to go to war to enforce the claim? ſuppoſe this done, and fifty or a hundred millions of dollars expended in the conteſt, what cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty is there that we ſhould at laſt accompliſh the object?</p>
                  <p>Moreover, the principle of ſuch a war would require, that we ſhould ſeek indemnification for the expenſes of the war itſelf, in addition to our former claim. What proſpect is there, that this alſo would be effected? yet if not effected, it is evident that we ſhould have made a moſt wretched bargain.</p>
                  <p>Why did we not inſiſt on indemnification for the expenſes of our revoiution war? Surely, not becauſe it was leſs reaſonable, but becauſe it was evident that it could not have been obtained, and becauſe peace was neceſſary to us as well as to our enemy.
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:028389_0097_0FD8E7AEE8FA0168"/>This likewiſe would be the end of a war undertaken to enfore the claim of indemnification for the detention of the poſts. We ſhould at length be glad to make peace, either without the indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification ſought, or at beſt at an expenſe to carry on the war, without a chance of reimburſement, with which the thing gained would bear no compariſon.</p>
                  <p>The idea which has been thrown out, of leaving the poſts in the hands of the Britiſh, till we might be better able than, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>So much of the 2d article as gives to a Britiſh ſubject the rights of a natural-born citizen of the United States; without the previous reſidence, and other requiſites, enumerated in the late act of Congreſs;</p>

                  <p>The members compoſing this meeting, view, with no leſs aſtoniſhment than concern, the contempt manifeſted by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, for the conſtitution of the United States, in adviſing the preſident to ratify, proviſionally, a treaty, which violates the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential principles of our government, and excludes the houſe of repreſentatives, from an exerciſe of powers expreſsly given to them, as well as to the preſident and ſenate. They are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the conduct of the ſenate demands the ſerious atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every real friend to the union; and that an attempt ſo daring and ſo dangerous, calls for the moſt pointed and unequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal cenſure from the people.</p>
                  <p>Reſolved, as the opinion of this meeting, That the idea on which this treaty is founded, of <q>terminating the differences between the United States and Great Britain, without refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the merits of their complaints and pretenſions,</q> is as fallacious as it is new; that it is contrary to the principles ſanctioned by the executive in the correſpondence between the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It is alſo the opinion of this meeting, That the ſilence of this treaty, with reſpect to the ſlaves and other property carried off by the Britiſh troops, contrary to the 7th article of the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive treaty, is in the higheſt degree reprehenſible; becauſe a claim for compenſation, on this account, being a matter of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, ought, even under the idea above mentioned, to have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Reſolved, as the opinion of this meeting, That in the event of a war, or national difference, it may be both juſt and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, to ſequeſter and even confiſcate debts, due in this country, to the individuals of a nation at war with the United States; and that, <hi>if this power could be relinquiſhed,</hi> ſound policy requires, that, in the preſent ſituation of affairs, it ſhould be retained.</p>
                  <p>Reſolved, as the opinion of this meeting. That as by the law of nations (according to the modern conventions) and by the treaties between the United States and the French, the Dutch, the Swedes and the Pruſſians, free ſhips make free goods;—the 17th article of this treaty, which ſubjects French property in American bottoms to ſeizure, deſerves the moſt pointed reprobation; becauſe, it will immediately deprive the American merchants, of the benefit of carrying the goods of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at war with Great-Britain; becauſe, in caſe of a war be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the United States and France, <hi>which the</hi> PEOPLE <hi>forbid!</hi> American property, in Britiſh neutral veſſels, would be ſecure; and becauſe, in the preſent ſtate of affaire, it will produce ſuch injury to the French, as will give them <hi>juſt cauſe of reſentment</hi> againſt the partial policy of the American government.</p>
                  <p>Reſolved, as the opinion of this meeting, That the ſtipulation in the 18th article, making ſhip-timber, tar, hemp, ſails and copper, contraband of war, which are free by our treaties with other nations, is unneceſſarily hurtful to the trade of the United States, and manifeſts the ſame unfriendly temper to the French.</p>
                  <p>The members of this meeting are alſo of opinion, That all good citizens ſhould expreſs their decided diſapprobation of the ſecond clauſe of the 18th article, which authorizes, though not in words, yet in ſubſtance, the ſeizure of American veſſels carrying proviſions to France.</p>
                  <p>The members of this meeting ſolemnly declare their abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of a conceſſion, ſo incompatible with the object of the late embaſſy, ſo derogatory to the honor, ſo injurious to the intereſts of America, and ſo openly and pointedly hoſtile to the cauſe of France. They deteſt a war; they conſider it as treaſon againſt the happineſs of men; but they would cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully endure all the calamities which it produces, rather than in any ſhape be acceſſary to a combination, which is the ſcourge of Europe, and the diſhonor of the world.</p>
                  <p>Reſolved therefore, as the opinion of this meeting, That this treaty <hi>ought not to be ratified</hi> by the preſident and ſenate of the
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:028389_0105_0FD8E7BDDE51C3B8"/>United States, even if the Britiſh king ſhould conſent to a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of ſo much of the 12th article as reſpects the trade to be carried on, between the United States and the Britiſh Weſt India iſlands.</p>

                     </gap>y produce a material change from its preſent form. This treaty is now before the public, and, when the ſcrutinizing eye of America, ſhall have viewed it in all its aſpects, be aſſured, ſir, that the juſt and ſolid objections
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:028389_0106_0FD8E7C24B178DC8"/>which apply to it, will be found to be of a nature too imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to be reſiſted by the genuine patriot and guardian of his country's peace. It is not the object of the preſent addreſs, to enumerate thoſe objections at large; a few of the moſt promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent only are ſelected for your ſerious conſideration; of theſe, the firſt claſs may be denominated, omiſſions on the part of our negociator, and are as follow:</p>
                  <p>He has omitted to make any convention or ſtipulation for the protection of American ſeamen from impreſſment into the Britiſh naval ſervice, or otherwiſe to ſecure them againſt thoſe ſhameful impriſonments and detentions which have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a national grievance to the United States: although in the 23d article he has ſtipulated, on behalf of Great-Britain, "that Britiſh ſhips of war, with their officers and crews ſhall be hoſpitably received in the ports of the United States, paying due reſpect to the laws and government thereof; and that the officers ſhall be treated with that reſpect which is due to the commiſſions they bear; and if any <hi>inſult</hi> ſhould be offered to them by any of the inhabitants, all offenders in this reſpect ſhall be puniſhed as <hi>diſturbers of the peace and unity between the two countries.</hi>"</p>
                  <p>He has omitted to make any ſtipulation for the protection and ſecurity of the commerce of the United States to Spain, Portugal, and the Mediterranean, againſt the depredations of the Algerines and Barbary corſairs; although he knew that this forms one of the moſt beneficial branches of our trade, yielding a large annual balance in ſpecie in favor of the United States; and that the policy of our government has been, in all their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with the maritime powers, to obtain ſuch a ſtipulation, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expreſsly provided in both our exiſting treaties with France and Holland, that thoſe powers ſhall uſe their good offices and beſt endeavours to obtain this object—Nor could he be ignorant of what is avowed by lord Sheffield, one of the Britiſh king's privy council, to be the true policy of Great-Britain; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to countenance and encourage Algerine depredations on the American trade, and to prevent us, as much as poſſible, from becoming carriers. And this omiſſion is now the more to be regretted, ſince the recent official intelligence announced in all the newſpapers, that the Algerines, under the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Great Britain and Spain, have made peace with Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal, in conſequence of which, the Portugueſe cruiſers are to be recalled from the Mediterranean, and the Algerines again let looſe on the commerce of the United States.</p>

                     <pb n="108" facs="unknown:028389_0107_0FD8E7C40F8F3EF0"/>
He has omitted to make any ſtipulation, or obtain any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation whatever, for the negroes and other property carried away contrary to the treaty of peace, violating, it is believer, his poſitive inſtructions on this head.</p>

Inſtead of purſuing the principle contained in the 6th article, of diſregarding the deciſions of courts, and placing the merits of the complaint be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the commiſſioners, it obliges the commiſſioners to act in obedience to the deciſions of the Britiſh courts, where thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions have been regular and legal. If then the law of nations
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:028389_0110_0FD8E7CD905F3D08"/>and the orders of November and January have been regularly executed by thoſe courts, the complaints of our government are temedileſs, and the true ground of thoſe complaints abandoned by the treaty. Beſides, the ſtipulation was unneceſſary in caſes of irregul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Further, the laſt clauſe of this article, does not adhere to the principle ſupported in the 6th article, but again reſorts to the merits of Britiſh complaints, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes compenſation; ſhowing, that whenever American de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands were ſubmitted upon the principles of equity, the Britiſh negociator kept them in the courts for deciſion; and whenever their demands were urged, our negociator abandoned that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</p>
                  <p>The 9th article is ambiguous, and its conſtruction doubtful; but let that conſtruction be as it may, whenever, in the courſe of inheritance, alienage ſhall ſtop the courſe of deſcent, the right by eſcheat, accruing thereby to individual ſtates, is taken away; and this principle may, and doubtleſs will, be extended to the territorial rights of the ſtates.</p>
                  <p>The 10th article reverſes the good old maxim, 'that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure;' and our nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciator ſeems to have though that war firſt, and confiſcation af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, was better than ſequeſtration firſt and peace after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; ſince it is impoſſible to conceive that the greater evil, <hi>war,</hi> will not generally, if not always, produce the leſſer evil, <hi>confiſcation.</hi> But the article is deſtitute of all equality; Great Britain has fleets and armies, America none. Great Britain, by means of fleets and armies, can enforce the obſervance of our national duties towards her; we cannot reſort to the ſame means for the ſame ends: But the annual balance of trade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two countries is largely in favour of Great Britain; ſhe has always a large amount of property or of debts in our poſſeſſion, over which, the power of ſequeſtration or confiſcati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may be regarded as the American weapon of defence, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventive, equally, of future ſpoliations and depredations on our commerce, as of war itſelf. Humanity, therefore, is no leſs out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by this ſtipulation than every principle of policy, juſtice, and national right.</p>
                  <p>Thus, fir, have I endeavoured to lay before you the omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our negociator, as well as ſome of the moſt obvious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections to the ten firſt articles, which, by the 28th articles, are

It is eſſential to the due conſideration of the advantages and diſadvantages of a treaty, to examine the contracting parties; becauſe the ſame treaty may be good under ſome, and bad under other circumſtances; thus, when Carthage gave up her ſhips, wealth, and arms in the ſecond Punic war—the treaty might have been conſidered as good in relation to her then ſituation, humbled as ſhe was by the Roman arms, and compelled to rely for her exiſtence, as a nation, <hi>ſolely on the juſtice and humanity</hi> of the Roman ſenate; and yet a treaty of this ſort would have been conſidered as baſe and abject, if it had been made imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the battle of Cannae: and their ſenate (venal as Carthage then was) would not have been ſo loſt to every patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otic ſentiment as to have ſanctioned its ratification. Britain, on the day of the ſignature of the treaty, was involved in a war with the braveſt people in Europe; in the whole courſe of this war, ſhe had experienced continued defeats and diſgraces; her treaſures were waſted upon allies that either deſerted or were too feeble to afford her effectual aid; her debt had grown to the enormous ſum of three hundred millions; her navy could only be manned by the moſt deſtructive burdens upon her commerce; her manufactures were languiſhing, her fleets were unable to protect her trade, which had ſuffered unexampled loſſes. And while ſhe was ſinking under her burdens, her antagoniſt was conſolidating her government, and growing ſo rapidly in ſtrength, reputation, and vigor, as to threaten her exiſtence as a nation. The United States were, on the other hand, in the higheſt proſperity; their nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Sweden and Denmark, who had received inſults from Britain, were ready to make a common cauſe with her; and as the marine of England and France were nearly balanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the weight of America, had ſhe been forced into the war, would have turned the ſcale, and have completed the ruin of the Britiſh commerce, without any other effort than that of granting letters of marque. Independent of which, without the violation of their neutrality, by thoſe acts of ſovereignty which no one would diſpute their right to exerciſe, they could involve the Britiſh trade in the utmoſt diſtreſs, by an additional duty on Britiſh tonnage, by granting advantages to rival ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, by retaining debts due to her merchants, till the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries ours had ſuſtained were compenſated. By following her example, both in the preſent and in the late American war, and ſuffering no part of the public debt to be paid to her citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, till juſtice was done us, we could have forced her into
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:028389_0115_0FD8E7DA5215CA90"/>any meaſure that it was juſt or proper for us to aſk. And indeed, ſo fully ſatisfied were the Americans, of every party, on the ſuperiority of our ſituation, that no doubt was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of a favorable iſſue to Mr. Jay's negociation; and all that his friends lamented, and his enemies rejoiced in, was, that the principal credit of them would be aſcribed rather to the victories of France, than to the addreſs of our miniſter. Under theſe happy auſpices the negociation began: we ſhall proceed to ſee how it concluded.</p>
                     <p>The next point of enquiry is into the objects of the negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; for as every treaty is an abridgment of the natural freedom of nations, no wiſe ſtate ever enters into one, but with a view to remove ſome evil, or acquire ſome advantage. It is upon this ground, that many of our moſt diſtinguiſhed patriots have been of opinion, that all commercial treaties were injurious trammels and bargains, in which we might probably be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reached at the moment, or which circumſtances might them after render inconvenient; that America having nothing to ſell but articles of the firſt neceſſity to the nations with which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

A commercial treaty was not the object of Mr. Jay's miſſion; the Britiſh nation in direct violation of the treaty of Paris, refuſed to ſurrender the weſtern poſts; extended the limits of their juriſdiction, availed themſelves of their ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to poſſeſs the Indian trade, and ſtimulated the ſavages to ravage our frontier: Britiſh officers ever accompanying them in their incurſions, it became the dignity of the nation to demand a <hi>delivery</hi> of the poſts—<hi>reparation</hi> for the loſs of trade—a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation</hi> for the expence of the war the Britiſh had excited with the Indians—a <hi>public</hi> puniſhment of the Britiſh ſubjects who had perſonally appeared in arms againſt us, with the remo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>By the 2d article of the treaty, the Britiſh promiſe to eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate the Weſtern Poſts by the 1ſt of June, 1796. By the treaty of Paris, in 1783, they promiſed to evacuate with all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient ſpeed, which, if we may judge by the ſpeed with which they have found it convenient to evacuate all their poſts in
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:028389_0116_0FD8E7DBCD34B8D8"/>France, Flanders, Germany, Holland, and Brabant, one would have ſuppoſed muſt have meant a much ſhorter time than eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen months; ſo that all that the treaty acquires with reſpect to the poſts, is leſs than we were entitled to, by the treaty of Paris. Surely we might expect better ſecurity than a mere promiſe from a nation which has already ſhown, in their violation of the paſt, the little reliance that can be placed on their future, engagements. By June, 1796, it is not improbable that our ſituation, or that of Britain, may be changed; what ſecurity ſhall we then have for the performance of the treaty? It is ſaid, as has been already ſaid (by thoſe apologiſts whoſe arguments ſeem determined to find every miniſterial meaſure right) that every treaty is a promiſe, and that if we are not to rely upon a promiſe, there can be no treaties.—I anſwer, that it is the practice of negociators, where the character of the nation, or other circumſtances, give reaſon to ſuſpect a violation of their engagements, <hi>not to rely</hi> upon a naked promiſe, but to expect ſome guarantee or ſurety for the performance; that in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe, as the promiſe was evidently extorted by the preſſure of exiſting circumſtances, we ſhould ſee to the performance while thoſe circumſtances continue to exiſt. It is evident, before Mr. Jay left this country, that the Britiſh were ſo far from intending to evacuate the poſts, that they had determined to extend their limits; this may not only be inferred from all the encouragement they gave to the depredations of the Indians, but undeniably proved by Lord Dorcheſter's ſpeech, which, though diſavowed by Dund<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s, is now admitted to have been made in conſequence of expreſs inſtructions. The promiſe, then, to evacuate, has been extorted by French victories, by the humiliation of the Britiſh nation, and by their apprehenſion, that we might, at laſt, be provoked to do ourſelves juſtice, while they were embarraſſed with France. Surely, then, the evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould have been inſiſted upon, while theſe circumſtances operated with full force;—what was there to impede an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate evacuation of Oſwego, which is only occupied by a lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant's command? what was to prevent our troops being put in immediate poſſeſſion of Niagara and the upper poſts, under an engagement to protect, for a limited time, the Britiſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty that remained there? In one week this might have been effected, conſidering the ſituation of the poſts, upon navigable waters, as well as in one year.—May we not reaſonably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that the Britiſh ſtill entertain a hope, that peace between them and France, diſſentions between the United States and that Republic, the ſeeds of which are ſo plentifully ſown by the treaty itſelf, may enable them to violate their ſecond, with the

By a tame ſubmiſſion to theſe meaſures, we withhold that protection which is due to every citizen, and which indeed is the great end of government.

This article not only deſerves conſideration, as forming a ſtriking contraſt to our ſhameleſs indifference for the injuries and inſults our own officers and men have actually received, but as laying the foundation for future differences with Great Britain, whenever ſhe ſhall find it convenient to deny us ſome ſtipulated right, under pretence that the treaty has been violated.

                  <p>A MOTION was made to have the treaty read, which was done: it was then moved to diſcuſs, and paſs upon, the teaty, article by article—this motion was objected to, becauſe the ſubject had been ſo fully and ſo publicly diſcuſſed, and the members had had ſo much time to ſtudy the treaty, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately to form their opinion, that every one muſt be ready for the queſtion—it was therefore diſpenſed with.</p>

                     <p>I do not ſuppoſe that any perſon of common ſenſe or the ſmalleſt information, will conſider a treaty as good or but becauſe made or approved by this or that miniſter.

                     <p>"MR. JAY communicated freely with me on this ſubject during the courſe of the negociation; and I have witneſſed the great difficulties which have occurred in adjuſting ſeveral of the articles. Although ſome points might have been arranged more beneficially for us, if the treaty had been dictated entirely by the
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:028389_0132_0FD8E80BD02A5DE0"/>United States, yet when it is conſidered as a compoſition of differences, where mutual complaints had rendered mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions neceſſary to eſtabliſh a good underſtanding, I think it may fairly be ſaid, that as little has been conceded by Mr. Jay, and as much obtained for the United States, as, all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances conſidered, could be expected: the buſineſs, upon the whole, has been concluded more beneficially for us than I had any hope we could obtain by negociation ſix months ago, and, in my opinion, places us in a more advantageous ſituation than we ſhould have been in by becoming parties to the war."</p>

                  <p>THE citizens of Richmond, awfully impreſſed with the momentous criſis of American affairs—hold it not only their right, but their bounden duty, to expreſs their ſentiments to the chief magiſtrate of the United States, on a ſubject which ought to engage the mind of, and be carefully examined by, every citizen of America—and which, no doubt, has called forth the attention of a great part of Europe—we mean the propoſed treaty between America and Great Britain, as lately made public. And though they feel a ſecret ſatisfaction, in the firm belief, that the executive of the United States coincides in opinion with them; yet, as the ſituation of the head of that department, under the particular circumſtances of the preſent caſe, may wiſh for the general ſentiment of his fellow citizens, before an exerciſe of his own judgment on ſo important a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, is finally made; a judgment, not to be recalled by him or us, without the moſt dreadful conſequences, perhaps, enſuing; they therefore proceed to ſtate their opinion thereon.</p>

                  <p>THE committee appointed by their fellow citizens to take into conſideration and arrange their objections againſt a certain treaty between plenipotentiaries of the United States and his Britannic majeſty, ſigned on the 10th of November, 1794, Report,</p>
                  <p>That reciprocal benefit and mutual advantage are the only proper inducements for national negociations, and ought to be the baſis of all treaties between ſovereign and independent nations.</p>
                  <p>That the objects which preſented themſelves for a negociation with Great Britain, at the time when Mr. Jay was appointed to that miſſion, were in their nature truly intereſting to the juſtice, honor and happineſs, of the United States; among which we conſider the procuring a compliance with the treaty of peace, obtaining compenſation for recent ſpoliations on the property of American merchants, and preventing future repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions of ſuch injuries, as the moſt important. That, by the treaty above referred to, neither of theſe objects has been accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed,
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:028389_0134_0FD8E8141A5E1388"/>nor has any political or commercial benefit in favor of the United States been attained; but on the contrary, a variety of conceſſions have been made to Great Britain, in violation of the treaty of 1783, and of our engagements with France and other nations, in ſubverſion of the rights of the people, and if ratified, to the eternal diſgrace and reproach of our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>That the ſaid treaty is calculated to contravene the acts of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments and attainder, paſſed during the late American war, and to authorize the return of all perſons included in them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any condition, although that power is excluſively veſted in the legulatures of the reſpective ſtates.</p>
                  <p>That, by the treaty of peace, the right of property of the north weſtern territory within the boundaries deſignated therein, was veſted in the United States; and had that treaty been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with, would, long ago, have been diſpoſed of for their uſe: that the treaty lately made, whilſt it neceſſarily implies an aggreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or at leaſt a failure on the part of Great Britain, provides, not only an indemnity, but alſo, at our expenſe, a compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to her ſubjects, and clogs the ſurrender of an acknowledged right, withheld for eleven years, with proviſions tending to leſſen the value of ſuch ſurrender. This article and the next prove that Great Britain has ſo contrived the preſent treaty as to part with nothing on this head, even after the 1ſt of June, 1796, but the mere poſſeſſion and expenſe of the poſts in queſtion. By the ſtipulation in ſavor of her ſettlers, whether they remain Britiſh ſubjects, or diſguiſe themſelves as American citizens, it is evident the profits of their trade will centre in Great Britain, and the connections and influence continue as extenſive as ever with the Indian tribes; two objects appearing to your committee of more importance than the mere occupation of the ground; beſides, as, from the nature of this trade, and the manner of carrying it on, there will be abundant opportunity, ſo there can be little doubt that (in a people ſo recently leagued in war with the ſavages againſt us) there will be ſufficient inclination to deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>That it gives to the ſubjects of a foreign nation the uncontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable power and night of paſſing through the territory of the United States; a privilege which is contrary to the policy of all nations: that the navigation of the river Miſſiſſippi, although a right of the United States which cannot be q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>It is entirely ſilent on that important ſubject, the reſtoration of negroes, and other property carried from this continent by the Britiſh troops, in direct violation of the treaty of 1783, is the diſappointment, and, in many inſtances, ruin of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate citizens of the United States, who have ſuffered by this unwarrantable meaſure; whereas the Britiſh government and courts of law, where attempts have been made to recover by that means, have repeatedly held out aſſurances of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation.</p>
                  <p>We conſider that part of the treaty which makes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for compenſating the loſſes ſuſtained by citizens of the reſpective parties, by means of illegal ſpoliations, as manifeſtly and groſsly unequal and partial, and that, ſo far as it reſpects American citizens, it is altogether ineffectual, on their pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>It provides for the ſubjects of his Britannic majeſty of every deſcription, without regard to baniſhed perſons, to hold lands in the territories of the United States in like manner as if they were natives; and at the ſame time holds out that American citizens may do the ſame in her dominions, where it is well known that, by the Engliſh laws, aliens are incapacitated from holding real eſtates; and the comparative quantity of lands held by the citizens of the one power and ſubjects of the other, bears no manner of proportion.</p>
                  <p>The privilege offered by this treaty of trading to the Weſt Indies is ſo limited as to the burden of veſſels, that it can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford little or no benefit; it leaves all the advantages ſubject to the controul of exiſting and future legiſlative reſtrictions and prohibitions: Even this paltry privilege is rendered of very ſmall uſe to American merchants, by their being poſitively reſtricted from exporting the produce of the Weſt Indies to any part of the world in their own veſſels; and, in exchange for this pretended advantage, the treaty has relinquiſhed the right of exporting cotton, the growth of our own ſoil, and one of the moſt important ſtaples of the ſouthern ſtates, in American veſſels to foreign ports.</p>
                  <p>Your committee deem it neceſſary to obſerve fully on the article relating to the Weſt India trade, although its operation is ſuſpended by the ſenate; and they cannot forbear to remark, that this article, ſo far as it reſpects the privilege of trading with ſmall veſſels, is the only one in that treaty which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the ſmalleſt appearance of benefit to the United States.</p>
                  <p>It therefore appears to your committe extraordinary that the repreſentatives of the people in ſenate, inſtead of rejecting this unequal and unrighteous contract altogether, have ratified every part except the 12th article, in conſequence of which, every other article may be enforced, and this may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>It appears to your committee that the clauſe which reſtrains the congreſs of the United States from increaſing the tonnage of Britiſh veſſels, is calculated to ſuppreſs the American revenue, is an infringement of a conſtitutional right, and will induce the neceſſity of ſtraining the obnoxious meaſure of direct taxation to an impolitic degree.</p>

                  <head>Remarks on the IId Article of Mr. Jay's Treaty.</head>
                  <p>BY the 2d article of Mr. Jay's treaty, the ſettlers and traders within the precincts or juriſdiction of the poſts, now held by the Britiſh within the boundary lines of the United States, may remove, with all their effects; they may ſell their lands, houſes, or effects, or retain the property thereof, at their diſcretion. Such of them as ſhall continue to reſide within thoſe boundary lines, may remain Britiſh ſubjects if they chooſe, or become citizens of the United States—in the latter caſe they are bound to take the oath of allegiance.</p>
                  <p>The enemies of the treaty have endeavored to excite an alarm, under the pretence, that as the limits of the precincts or juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of thoſe poſts are not defined, the ſame may reach to vaſt extents of country, throughout which are or may be planted, even <hi>colonies</hi> of people devoted to the intereſt of Great Britain. But nothing can be more unfounded.</p>
                  <p>The poſts withheld, contrary to the treaty of peace, are two on Lake Champlain, in the ſtate of Vermont; one perhaps at Oſwegatchie; and thoſe of Oſwego, Niagara, Detroit, and Michilimackanac.</p>
                  <p>All theſe poſts are <hi>military ſtations,</hi> either without any Britiſh ſettlers about them, or with but a few families, except the poſt of Detroit. Detroit was originally ſettled by the French. The attention of the inhabitants was devoted to the Indian trade; and conſequently they cultivated very little land. By the peace of 1763, Detroit, with all Canada, was ceded to Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Since that time a few American, Engliſh, Scotch, and Iriſh ſettlers and traders, have joined the old French inhabitants: but Detroit ſtill remains an inconſiderable village. The ſettlers within its juriſdiction are chiefly planted along the border of the river: but their ſettlements are of ſuch ſmall extent, and ſo little land has been cultivated, that they have not been able to furniſh a ſurplus of proviſions ſufficient to ſeed its ſmall garriſon of two or three hundred men. For the conſumption of theſe few troops, flour has been ſent from the United States and Lower Canada, and pork from Ireland.</p>
                  <p>What, then, can be the "juriſdiction" of this poſt? Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe would ſuppoſe it of very ſmall extent; that it was co-extenſive with the ſettlers; and, in the utmoſt latitude, comprehended no more of the land at and about Detroit, than belonged to them at the ſignature of the treaty. The reſt of the
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:028389_0143_0FD8E82D429B09B8"/>country belongs to the Indians; who, though hitherto under the <hi>influence,</hi> can in no ſenſe be ſaid to be within the <hi>jur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſdiction</hi> of Detroit.</p>
                  <p>To form a juſt idea of the poſſible extent of the landed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of theſe people, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>By the 1ſt article of the treaty of peace, Great Britain cedes and relinquiſhes to the United States, "all claim to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>propriety</hi> and <hi>territorial</hi> rights of the ſame, and every part thereof," conſequently, the lands of the Britiſh ſubjects within the precincts or juriſdiction of Detroit, and any other Britiſh poſts within the territory of the United States, can be of no greater extent <hi>now,</hi> than they were at the treaty of peace. If the king of Great Britain, or any of his governors of officers, have ſince made grants of lands within the boundaries of the United States (a thing not probable) ſuch grants are mere nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. The lands ſo attempted to be granted, being by that treaty the abſolute property of the United States, the Britiſh ſubjects could not afterwards acquire any property in them; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently they cannot hold them by Mr. Jay's treaty.</p>
                  <p>One word concerning the inhabitants of Detroit. They are chiefly <hi>French,</hi> with whom it is to be preſumed we ſhall find no difficulty in <hi>fraternizing;</hi> and of the others, whether originally Americans or Engliſh, Scotch or Iriſh, many, and probably the majority, are already well diſpoſed towards the United States, and eager to enjoy all the advantages of our free govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and citizenſh. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                     <head>No. III.</head>
                     <p>HAVING touched upon the demand, which, under the treaty, we are entitled to make for the loſs of property carried off, I have ſince examined official documents, to wit, the letter of the commander in. chief, and the report of our commiſſioners, from which it may be fairly eſtimated, at about one million of dollars. As this was the firſt infraction of the treaty, and made without the ſlighteſt pretence, there can be no doubt of the juſtice of our demand, as well for intereſt as prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, which would raiſe the aggregate amount to about one million ſeven hundred thouſand dollars. Is it not very extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary that Mr. Jay ſhould neglect an object of ſo much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, while he was ſo ſedulous in loading the United States with the private debts of Britiſh merchants? If (which there is the beſt founded reaſon to deny) there is really any thing due on that ſcore, ſurely no better fund can be conceived for its diſcharge than this well-authenticated claim upon the Britiſh government. What makes this omiſſion the more extraordinary, is, that the preſident, while commander in chief, congreſs in the year 1783, and at various periods ſince, and Mr. Jefferſon very lately, have uniformly treated this article as very important, inſiſted upon its fulfilment, and procured ſuch authentic documents of its amount, as to leave Britain without the ſmalleſt apology for its inexecution.</p>
                     <p>The next object of Mr. Jay's negociation was to obtain ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the inſults our national flag had ſuſtained, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs for the injuries done our trade in violation of the laws of nations. Theſe may be divided into two claſſes,
<list>
                           <item>1. Acts autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized and ordered by the court of St. James's.</item>
                           <item>2. Acts done by individuals <hi>under colour,</hi> but in abuſe, of thoſe orders.</item>
                        </list> The firſt claſs muſt, neceſſarily, govern the deciſions of their maritime courts, which, though profeſſing to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>aled by the laws of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, always take the direction of the ſovereign as the expoſitor of thoſe laws. Thus, when Mr. Pitt ſeized, in time of profound peace, all French veſſels, and thereby outraged every principl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> of natural law, the Britiſh courts of admiralty found no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in condemning them. When, in the ſame was, to pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Indeed it would be a ſoleciſm to ſay, that the king ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>

                        </gap>rame inſtructions, and give orders for making prizes, and that his courts have power to over-rule thoſe orders, and puniſh the ſubject that obeys them; ſince it muſt often happen, that the intereſt of the ſtate may juſtify a breach of the code of nations, without its being proper to communicate to the ordinary courts the principles upon which this juſtification is formed. Accordingly, we find it the conſtant practice what a new edict is iſſued, to ſend it to the maritime courts as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> rule for their conduct in determining of prize or no prize. And the courts of appeal in prize caſes conſiſt of commiſſioners of appeal, of whom a majority muſt be privy counſellors (22 Gen. II. chap. 3.) the reaſon for which is, that their deciſions, as judges, may conform to the inſtructions they give as privy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors. The ſecond claſs of injuries, ariſing from abuſes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by individuals under colour of ſuch orders and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are always corrected (not, however, without a great expenſe and delay) by the inferior courts of vice-admiralty i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> This diſtinction will be important in diſcuſſing the 7th article of the treaty. Let us now examine the cauſes of complaint <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> as ariſing under both theſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1ſt. Orders were iſſued for detaining our veſſels going to France, loaded with proviſions, even before the war broke out; and we were compelled to part with our property at ſuch prices as the Britiſh market afforded, though a better one was open to us in France.</p>
                     <p n="2">2d. They iſſued orders to take all our veſſels going to France with proviſions; and ſhortly after, in the moſt perfidious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, without any notice, without even publiſhing their intention in England, leſt we ſhould learn it from thence, inſtructed their armed ſhips in the Weſt Indies, to make prizes of all neutral veſſels ſailing, either to or from the French iſland. Theſe ſeveral cruel and unprovoked attacks upon our commerce, cannot be palliated by any law of nations, however obſolete, and were attended with the following ſerious evils to this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, for which we are entitled to a <hi>national</hi> compenſation.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. The loſs of that property which the country would have acquired, had not many been deterred by theſe meaſures from entering into this branch of commerce.—As this cannot be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But the number of theſe were comparatively ſmall; and for theſe courts of adjudication were always open; and yet, by a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary fatality, Mr. Jay overlooks all theſe flagrant injuries committed by the Britiſh king againſt the United States <hi>as a nation,</hi> and for which they are without remedy, but by a nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal compenſation, and neither aſks nor procures any redreſs.</p>
                     <p>The nature of Mr. Jay's application is explained in his courtly note to Lord Grenville. This contains no complaint of any of the inſtructions I have alluded to, or any other, expreſſive of the injury that one <hi>nation</hi> had done to the other, but merely in the
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:028389_0149_0FD8E8392FA95EC8"/>caſe of <hi>individuals.</hi> His words are, that great and exceſſive injuries have, under <hi>colour of his majeſty's commiſſion</hi> and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, been done to a numerous claſs of American merchants, (not to the American nation) the United States can, for repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have recourſe "<hi>only</hi> to the juſtice, authority, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of his majeſty." Through the whole of this note, he ſpeaks of nothing further than individual compenſation for indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual injury, leaving the two nations entirely out of ſight as nations; and indeed if he had intended any thing more, if he had had the inſtructions I have mentioned, in view, it would have been impoſſible for him to have made uſe of ſo many p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>The 7th article exactly purſues the principles eſtabliſhed in the note, to wit, that the United States are entitled to no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe; that the government of Great Britain has done us no injury, and that "divers merchants and others" only have to complain of the irregularity of ſome captures and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, which it ſuppoſes the courts of admiralty are, for the moſt part, competent to decide upon. But that if it ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, that there are any loſſes for which adequate compenſation cannot be obtained, provided that the party claiming has been guilty of no neglect or delay, ſuch compenſation ſhall be aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by commiſſioners, and his Britannic majeſty engages to pay them. As this article ſays nothing about opening the courts, it muſt have been underſtood by both parties, that they were neceſſarily open, independent of the treaty; ſo that all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, if any, that may reſult from appeals, were rights that individuals in every civilized nation may claim, and which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:028389_0150_0FD8E83D4CF2AAB0"/>had exerciſed before Mr. Jay's miſſion. In this reſpect, then, nothing was effected by his negociation, unleſs it was, that the time for bringing appeals is ſaid to have been enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but of this, the treaty ſays nothing; this too, muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, depend upon the will of the king of Great Britain, or on the rules his courts chuſe to eſtabliſh. All that Mr. Jay has then done in this important buſineſs, that involved the honor of his country, the great intereſts of its commerce, the rights and liberties of its citizens, and the property of individuals, many of whom have been ruined by the loſs of their capital, is to obtain <hi>a promiſe</hi> of compenſation in ſuch caſes as are ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly circumſtanced as not to be within the reach of legal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs. When we come to view this article, ſtripped of its unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary verbiage, it will appear to mock with deluſive hopes, the men that it affects to relieve. Let us enquire what is to be the buſineſs of the commiſſioners, and of what nature and kind the cauſes that are to come before them.</p>
                     <p>They are not to relieve againſt captures under the order of April, November, or January. 1ſt. Becauſe neither of theſe are complained of, and the preamble of the article expreſsly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

The great cauſe of complaint, <hi>the inſtructions,</hi> which are the laws of the court of admiralty, not being complained of, all condemnations fairly made under them, muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the treaty.

By the treaty of peace, our boundaries are fixed, and the Britiſh are to evacuate our territory without any ſtipulation, whatever, in favor of Britiſh merchants or traders; by this treaty, therefore, ſo much of the fur and peltry trade, at leaſt as lay within our own territory, was neceſſarily and excluſively ours; as we poſſeſſed all the poſts at which the trade had been carried on for a century paſt, and moſt of the port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages.

I muſt confeſs, that I have yet to learn, that any Eaſt India arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles conſumed by the Indians, on the north of the lakes, will exceed one hundred dollars a year; perhaps the writer means, that the inhabitants of Canada will receive them through this channel; if we ſhould even admit this, which, however, we ſhall be able to ſhow is highly improbable, yet it would appear a very inſignificant advantage, when we reflect that the whole number of inhabitants in Canada, and Labrador, as appears by a cenſus, taken by General Haldiman, amounted, in 1784, including Upper Canada, to only 123, 082 ſouls: but few of theſe are in the habit of drinking any tea, and all are too poor to conſume any but the coarſeſt articles; ſo that the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of Canada, in India goods, if we had a monopoly of that trade, would fall ſhort of what is conſumed in the little ſtate of New Jerſey; and we ſhould certainly make a miſerable exchange, if for this we ſacrifice a branch of commerce of ſuch immenſe importance, as the Indian trade.</p>
                     <p>But what can be more abſurd than to ſuppoſe that articles which come duty-free from Britain (a drawback being allowed on exportation) and are carried into the heart of the ſettled parts of Canada in the ſame veſſels that bring them from Europe, cannot be ſold cheaper than the ſame articles, ſubject to a heavy duty, and carried an immenſe diſtance by land, and an expenſive inland navigation? this indeed may not apply to the upper poſts; but who are the conſumers of Eaſt India articles in thoſe cold, poor, and barren regions?</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, the more any one conſiders this article, the more fully he will be convinced, that it contains a complete and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute ſurrender of the fur trade, the greater part of which we might have excluſively poſſeſſed under the treaty of peace, had not Lord Grenville prevaried on Mr. Jay, to introduce a rival who will always be too powerful for us.

                     <p>This article is not leſs exceptionable in a political, than in a commercial, view.

The <hi>manner aforeſaid,</hi> alludes to the former part of the article, which gives the Britiſh a right to navigate our rivers from the ſea to the higheſt ports of entry for foreigners, and from thence by land into the Indian country. The only natural conſtruction of theſe words, is, that the Britiſh ſhall have a right to import into the United States upon the ſame terms as Americans; and yet I can hardly conceive that Mr. Jay could intend, in the face of a law of the United States (Act making further proviſion for the payment of the debts of the United States, chap. 39. ſec. 2.) which impoſes an additional duty of ten per cent. on ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles imported in veſſels not of the United States; I ſay, I ſhould hardly conceive that he ſhould preſume to enter into ſuch ſtipulation directly in the face of a law of the United States, and that, too, in favor of a nation whoſe navigation act is at war with our commerce; did it not breathe the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit with the 12th, 14th, and 15th articles, all of which ſtrike directly at the navigation of theſe ſtates. Nor do I know any other conſtruction that can poſſibly be put on the words, which I have ſtated at large, that every reader may judge for himſelf. It is, however, poſſible, that Mr. Jay may have <hi>intended</hi> (for never was a public inſtrument drawn with leſs preciſion than the one before us) that this proviſion ſhould only extend to goods brought in for the purpoſes of the Indian trade; yet how the words can be made to bear this co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>ruction, I am at a loſs to conceive. But ſhould even this be admitted to be the true meaning, it will again prove the extreme ſolicitude of the framers of the treaty, to ſecure to the Britiſh the whole benefit of the Indian trade; without this article, goods might be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed of our merchants, for the purpoſe of this commerce, which would, on account of the ten per cent. difference, have been imported in American veſſels; but this ſlight advantage, it ſeems, was deemed too much for the ſacrifice of the whole profits of the Indian trade. It is therefore ſtipulated, that the Britiſh ſhall navigate our rivers to the higheſt port of entry for foreign veſſels, and that upon this conſtruction they ſhall pay <hi>no foreign duty</hi> for the articles they import; ſo that all that the Britiſh merchants will have to do, will be to eſtabliſh factories at the ports of entry, and under pretence of the Indian trade (if it ſhould be thought that the words ſhould be confined to that) import in Britiſh bottoms, upon the ſame terms as we d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Lord Grenville, however, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that the transfer of our whole <hi>Weſt India</hi> trade and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, was not ſufficiently ruinous to our commerce, aſks and obtains from our polite envoy, in return for his majeſty's condeſcenſion in accepting ſo great a part of our trade, that we would alſo prohibit the exportation of melaſſes, ſugar, coffee, cocoa, or cotton, in American veſſels, either from his majeſty's iſlands, <hi>or from the United States,</hi> to any part of the world, reaſonable ſea-ſtores excepted. The few apologiſts that the treaty has yet found, affect to believe, that the reſtriction is to be confined to ſuch of the above articles as are imported only from the Britiſh iſlands; but the words are expreſs, "that the United States will prohibit and reſtrain the carrying <hi>any</hi> (not any ſuch) melaſſes, &amp;c." and the reaſon they will urge in defence of the only true and obvious conſtruction, would be, that as one caſk of coffee cannot be diſtinguiſhed from another, if <hi>any</hi> was exported, that which came from their iſlands would be exported; and thus we would, in this circuitous route, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a certain proportion of the carrying trade. That this is a part of a general ſyſtem for the ruin of our navigation (Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain always having dreaded us as a rival) will appear from the inſtructions for armed ſhips, of the 8th of January, 1794, which remain unrevoked, and, as far as we have yet learned, uncenſured by Mr. Jay. By that their armed veſſels are inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed "to bring in for <hi>lawful adjudication</hi> all ſhips with their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes that are laden with goods, the produce of the French Weſt India iſlands, for any port of Europe." How then ſtands our trade as to the exportation of thoſe important articles? 1ſt. We are not to ſhip them from the French iſlands 2d. We are not to ſhip them from the Britiſh iſlands. 3d.

Humiliating as this article is, when I come to conſider the 14th and 15th articles, it will appear, that neither this nor the loſs of the Indian trade, are the ſevereſt blows aimed by this treaty, at the commerce and navigation of the United States.</p>

                     <p>HAVING had occaſion to ſhow, in conſidering the treaty in a mere commercial view, that it contained an expreſs relinquiſhment of the Indian trade; that it placed the Weſt Indian commerce upon ſo diſadvantageous a footing, as to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foreign nations our carriers, not only in that trade, but in the exportation of many articles (as ſugar, cotton, coffee, cocoa) that we might import from the Weſt Indies, or raiſe among ourſelves; I proceed now to ſhow, that our veſſels will become equally uſeleſs in the European trade, if the treaty goes into effect. By the ſimple operation of her navigation laws, Britain had poſſeſſed herſelf of almoſt the whole of the carrying trade between the United States and her dominions. From October 1789 to September 1790, both incluſive, the amount of ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> exports to Britain and her dominions were of the value of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> millions three hundred and ſixty-three dollars; and our imports from thence, upwards of fifteen millions two hundred thouſand dollars; making, together, upwards of twenty-four millions five hundred thouſand dollars, on which commerce we paid Britain a balance of near ſix millions, while we gained from hence a balance of more than two millions and one half; yet this immenſe trade with Britain only employed 43, 580 tons of American veſſels, while the trade to France employed 116, 410 tons, though our trade with her was leſs than one-fifth of our trade with Britain. The extreme injury the United States ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by thus ſuffering a foreign nation to run away with their carrying trade, and, of courſe, cutting the ſinews of their commerce and maritime ſtrength, was urged as the beſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the formation of the federal government; as, by that means, we ſhould acquire the means of making reſtrictive laws upon the commerce of nations that oppreſſed ours. We accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly find, that very early after the formation of our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, tonnage duties were impoſed upon foreign veſſels; and the immediate effect of them was to add new vigor to our navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; it will appear by the preſent ſtate of our tonnage,
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:028389_0162_0FD8E8624E19C590"/>compared with that I have given, that, under the operation of this law, we were progreſſing ſo faſt to a conſiderable degree of rank among maritime nations, as to incur the jealouſy of that ambitious and ſelfiſh people, who fancy themſelves the lords of the ocean, and conſider every other that attempts to navigate it, as intruders upon their rights. To this cauſe we muſt attribute, in part, the various attacks that they have, from time to time, made on our commerce; it remained, however, to give it the fatal and final blow, which ſhould put it out of our power to carry for ourſelves or others: and the honor of effecting this was reſerved for our envoy extraordinary, and a majority of that body to whom the ſtates had confided our deareſt rights. I have already obſerved, that the 12th article, taken together with the inſtructions of the 8th of January (at this moment in force) effectually precludes us, not only from the carrying trade of Britiſh or French iſlands, even though France has generouſly admitted us to carry from hers on the moſt favorable terms, but has actually cut off the carriage of our own commodities and certain others, of foreign and domeſtic growth, from our own ſtates; and that the trade of India-goods is ſo managed alſo, as neceſſarily to fall to the ſhare of Britain, to the excluſion of ourſelves. Let us now ſee on what footing our European trade will ſtand: 1ſt. In time of peace, and next, when Britain ſhall be at war. By our tonnage and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue laws, our ſhips had an advantage in the trade to Britain, of 44 cents the ton; and the diſcriminating duty of near 10 per cent. operated as a premium upon our own ſhipping; yet even this by no means countervailed the effect of the navigation law, and other reſtraints upon our commerce. But ſtill under the operation of theſe ſtatutes of the United States, our trade and navigation flouriſhed, and was increaſing; and as we reſerved a right in our own hands, in caſe of new burdens, to impoſe further duties upon thoſe that injured us, we had the moſt perfect ſecurity againſt any further legal attacks upon our commerce. Becauſe, ſuch was the nature of our commodities as to be eſſential to the nations with whom we dealt; while a variety of markets could furniſh upon nearly equal terms, thoſe that we wanted. To Britain we paid an annual balance of near ſix millions of dollars: which ſhe muſt neceſſarily, and perhaps for ever, have loſt, if, by a commercial warfare, ſhe diverted it into any other channel. What, however, ſhe did not dare to attempt openly by her laws, ſhe has fully effected by her treaty.</p>
                     <p>By the 14th and 15th articles, we agree, that ſhe ſhall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon our American veſſels, a tonnage duty, <hi>equal</hi> to what her ſhips pay here; that the ſhall alſo impoſe a duty which ſhall

Does not France reſerve a right to do the ſame? Undoubtedly; had the article ſtopped at this point, it would have been perfectly juſt; and the navigation of each nation would have then depended upon the means they reſpectively had of building, victualling, and ſailing their ſhips, which is exactly the caſe between us and France. But unfortunately the articles referred to, while they affect to be reciprocal, leave in full force the Britiſh navigation act, and all their other re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                     <p>Mr. Jay, therefore, agrees, in the 14th article, that all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Now, as the profits of every voyage are calculated on the outward and homeward voyage, if we pay in the Britiſh dominions exactly what they pay here, the charge upon the whole voyage is the ſame. If then, previous to the paſſing our tonnage laws, the Britiſh, by the operation of their navigation laws, had ſuch advantage over us, in our own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, as to employ two hundred and thirty thouſand tons of their ſhipping, as they did in 1789; while the whole of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can ſhipping employed in the trade with Britain and its domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, amounted, in the ſame year, to only 3, 580 tons, leſs than one-ſixth part of the whole quantity engaged in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of commodities between the two nations—it muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that we ſhall again be reduced, in <hi>conſequence of the treaty,</hi> to our former humiliating ſituation; our ſeamen muſt go into the ſervice of the nation that is again to navigate for us; and our ſhip-builders, and the numerous trades connected with them, muſt ſtarve, or ſeek ſome other employment, ſince our merchants will no longer have occaſion for ſhips, and the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh merchants are not permitted to <hi>uſe thoſe</hi> we build. It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, too, that the tonnage duty, which Britain is to lay, is not a countervailing duty, like that on goods imported, but is to be, in the words of the article, "<hi>equal to that which is paya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by</hi> Britiſh veſſels in the ports of America." Now foreign veſſels pay 50 cents here; of courſe, 50 cents may be impoſed on our veſſels in Britain; but our own veſſels alſo pay ſix cents a ton at home, ſo that on every voyage to the Britiſh dominions, and home again, they will pay 56 cents, while the Britiſh pay only 50; and as the voyage may be performed three times a year, the American ſhip will pay on the whole, 18 cents a ton annually more than the Britiſh; and it may be a queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have any right to repeal the law laying the home duty, as it was impoſed and enacted when the treaty was made and ratified, and as the repeal would put the Britiſh veſſels in a leſs advantageous ſituation than they were in at the time the treaty was made.

Nor does it require much more, to ſee that the leading objects of this treaty are, to eſtabliſh the navigation and commerce of Britain upon the ruins of our own—to fill the Atlantic ports, and the weſtern territory, with Britiſh merchants and factors—to eſtabliſh a certain degree of rank for Britiſh officers, whom the humiliated American is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, under pain of being "confidered as a diſturber of the peace of both nations, to treat <hi>with the reſpect due to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion;"</hi>—to put ſuch ſetters upon our legiſlature as would for ever bind them to the will of that imperious nation—to diſguſt our republican allies, and leave us <hi>only to the juſtice and humanity of the man</hi> who has urged our ſlaves to cut our throats—ſavages to murder our women and children—Barbarian pirates to enſlave our mariners—and his own banditti to profane our churches, burn our dwellings, and rob, plunder, and maſſacre our citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens. If we compare this treaty with many ſpeeches, made about the period of Mr. Jay's appointment, with the ſupport he has avowedly received from the Britiſh faction, with the warmth with which he engaged in the controverſy between our government and the French miniſter—if we add the readineſs that ardent or vindictive men feel, to ſuppoſe every thing right, which ſtrengthens their party—we ſhall be leſs ſurpiſed at the treaty contravening the exiſting laws of the country, where they bore hard upon the Britiſh, or its giving them ſuch addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional encouragement as ſhould induce them to pour in their myrmidons to ſupport and ſtrengthen the hands of government, againſt native Americans, and the friends and well-wiſhers to foreign and domeſtic republics—whom the courtiers have dared to calumniate with the names of antifederal and jacobin.</p>

Mr. Pinckney informs us in his letter to Mr. Jefferſon, that Lord Grenville, in ſtating the principles on which they had iſſued the inſtructions of the 8th of January, 1794, made uſe of theſe terms, "the ſecond was one, that he [Lord Grenville] could not mention to me officially, but that he ſtill thought it right I ſhould be appriſed of, that no miſconception of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives might be entertained; that he was aware of the delicacy of ſpeaking to a foreign miniſter, concerning the internal ſtate of his country; neither could he expect an anſwer from me on the ſubject.

I am a little ſurprized that the words <hi>reciprocal</hi> had not ſmote Mr. Jay's conſcience, when the very ſentence in which he uſes it, holds forth partial advantages to Britain, and none to America. Why muſt all the territories of the United States be laid open to Britiſh mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants; whilſt ours are confined only to the ſpot preciſely on which they find no intereſt in ſettling? Were we permitted to ſettle and carry on trade in the Eaſt or Weſt Indies, on the footing of natives, many would find an intereſt in availing themſelves of it. But what American merchant will think of eſtabliſhing a mercantile houſe in England, unleſs in partnerſhip with a native of that country? in which caſe the article is uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to him. Is it not evident, that this is part of the ſyſtem I hinted at in my laſt? It will be ſtill more ſo, when we reflect, that ſeveral modes of retaliation were propoſed by Mr. Jefferſon, as the means of compelling Britain to treat us as we merited, in return for the great benefit we permitted her to derive from our commerce. Among others, he ſuggeſts, "that where a nation refuſes permiſſion to our merchants and factors to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide within certain parts of their dominions, we may, if it ſhould be thought expedient, refuſe reſidence to theirs, in any or every part of ours, or modify their tranſactions."</p>

<pb n="173" facs="unknown:028389_0172_0FD8E87FE4EEF8A8"/>from a ſpirit of conciliation, and becauſe that we believed, that the equivalent might be ſettled by treaty to mutual advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. But to ſubmit to all, to aſk no equivalent, to relinquiſh the right of doing ourſelves juſtice, was a moſt unheard-of deſertion of the intereſts of our own country. It was one which no other nation in the world would ſuffer to paſs with impunity, and which I grieve to think a ſingle native of America can be found to juſtify.</p>
                     <p>It is true, that this article propoſes, that two years after the preſent war, the contracting parties may treat for the equaliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the duties, &amp;c. but that in the mean time it is to remain on the footing the treaty places it. Upon what ground was this diſcuſſion poſtponed? if Mr. Jay was ſent to make a treaty, why did he not make it, but leave it open to future diſcuſſion? is it probable that at the end of the war (which may laſt ſeveral years, and two years after, that is, when Britain has had time to recruit her ſtrength and her finances, ſhe will be more moderate in her views, than at this moment, when ſhe is overwhelmed with calamities? Is it probable, that at that period our trade will be of more conſequence to her than now, that ſhe has loſt two important branches of it, Holland and France? It ſhould be recollected, that the exportations from the Britiſh dominions to the United States, taken on the medium of two years, 1784 and 1785, exceed one-third of all her manufactures exported <hi>to all the reſt of the world.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At that time, Holland, which, next to America, is their beſt cuſtomer, had not declined their market. At preſent it will not be extravagant to allege, that the United States con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume two-fifths of all the Britiſh manufactures that are exported to foreign nations. The diſtreſs that a rupture with us, or any interruption of our commerce, would occaſion in England, is beyond calculation. This, then, was the moment to treat upon the moſt advantageous terms, or to exert our inherent right to do ourſelves juſtice <hi>by our own laws.</hi> It is in knowing how to take advantage of ſuch circumſtances, that true policy conſiſts. Every one remembers how much the preſident's foreſight was commended in having ſeized upon this moment to ſend a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial envoy. But this envoy, it ſeems, thought differently from the preſident, and agrees formally, that we ſhall take no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the ground on which we ſtand; but that, when Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain may have recovered what ſhe has loſt, then we will treat.</p>
                     <p>Is there any kind of connection between the preſent war and our commercial regulations with Britain? If not, why have any reference to the war, in ſetting the time for making our arrangements? Why but to give Britain ſtill greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages

                     <p>IT was my intention to have compriſed in two numbers, the examination of the 2d article; but on experiment, it was found expedient to add a third. I reſume, for a moment, the ſubject of indemnification for the detention of the poſts.</p>
                     <p>As an inducement to perſiſt in this claim, we are aſſured, that the magnanimity of France, would have procured for us, its eſtabliſhment. In the firſt place, this ſuppoſes that we we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> to have become a party in the war; for otherwiſe it would be ſilly to imagine, that France would, on our account, embarraſs herſelf with a difficulty of this ſort. In this caſe, and ſuppoſing the object accompliſhed, ſtill the injuries, loſſes, and expenſes of war would have greatly overbalanced the advantage gained. But what certainty have we, that France will be able to dictate terms, even for herſelf? Could we expect or rely, after the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and waſting war, in which ſhe has been engaged, that ſhe would be willing to encumber the making of peace, with addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional obſtacles, to ſecure ſo trifling a point with us? Would it be even humane, or friendly in us, to aſk her to riſk the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:028389_0174_0FD8E885985E57A0"/>of her calamities, for ſo trivial an object? A conduct like this, with reference either to France, or to ourſelves, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ames of diſcord and contention.</p>
                     <p>There is a marked diſingenuouſneſs, running through the obſervations, which are made to the prejudice of the treaty: they endeavour conſtantly to have it underſtood, that our envoy abandoned, without effort, the claims which have not been eſtabliſhed.—Whence is this inferred? Is it from the ſilence of the treaty? Surely we can only expect to find there what was <hi>agreed upon,</hi> not what was <hi>diſcuſſed</hi> and <hi>rejected.</hi> The truth is, that as well on this point of indemnification, for the detention of the poſts, as on that of compenſation, for the negroes carried away, our envoy urged our pretenſions, as far, and as long, as he could do it, without making them final obſtacles to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the negociation.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall now enumerate and anſwer the remaining objections, which have appeared againſt this article. They are theſe: 1. That the poſts to be ſurrendered, inſtead of being deſcribed in general terms, ſhould, for greater certainty, have been ſpecially enumerated; that now the uncertainty of a part of the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary line, may furniſh a pretext for detaining ſome of them. 2. That the expreſſions "precincts and juriſdictions," which are excepted from our right of ſettlement, previous to the ſurrender, are ſo vague and indeterminate, as to be capable of being made to countenance encroachments. 3. That it was improper to have ſtipulated, for the inhabitants, the option of reſiding and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing Britiſh ſubjects, or of becoming American citizens: that the firſt was to eſtabliſh, by treaty, a Britiſh colony, within our limits; the laſt to admit, without the power of exception, bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ter enemies of the country, to the privileges of citizens. 4. That the ſecuring to thoſe inhabitants, the enjoyment of their property is exceptionable, as being a "ceſſion without equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of an <hi>indefinite extent of territory.</hi>" This is the character given to it by the meeting at Philadelphia.</p>
                     <p>The anſwer to the firſt objection, is, that the enumeration propoſed might have included the very danger which is objected to the proviſion as it ſtands, and which is completely avoided by it. The principal poſts occupied by the Britiſh, are known and might eaſily have been enum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="176" facs="unknown:028389_0175_0FD8E886D65210C8"/>there being others not known, which might have eſcaped. Laſt year there ſtarted up a poſt, which had not been before hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> which, for ſeveral years paſt, has been inacceſſible to us? If our envoy's information could have been perfect, at the time of his laſt advices from America; between that period and the ſigning of the treaty, changes might have taken place, that is, trading houſes might have grown into military poſts, as they did in the caſe referred to; a caſe, which, in fact, happened after the departure of our envoy from the United States. Was it not far better than to hazard an imperfect ſpecification, to uſe terms ſo general and comprehenſive, as could not fail, in any circumſtances, to embrace every caſe? Certainly it was; and the terms <hi>"all ports and places,"</hi> which are thoſe uſed in the treaty, are thus comprehenſive. Nothing can eſcape them.</p>
                     <p>Neither is there the leaſt danger that the uncertainty<note n="*" place="bottom">This uncertainty, it is to be obſerved, reſults not from the late treaty, but from the treaty of peace.

                        </gap>, of the boundary line (except that depending on the river. St. Croix, which is on a ſide unconnected with the poſition of the poſts) is that which is run from the lake of the Woods to the Miſſiſſippi.—The moſt weſtern of our known poſts, is at Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chillimackinac, at or near the junction of the lakes Huron and Michegan, eaſtward near eleven degrees of longitude of the lake of the Woods, and about ten degrees of longitude of that point, on the Miſſiſſippi, below the falls of St. Anthony, where a ſurvey, in order to a ſettlement of the line, is to begin. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, our line, by the treaty of peace, is to paſs through the lake Huron, and the water communication between that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> and lake Superior, and through the middle of lake Superior, and thence weſtward through other waters, to the lake of the Woods; that is, about half a degree of latitude more northward, and about eight degrees of longitude more weſtward, than any part of the lake Michegan. Whence it is manifeſt, that any cloſing line, to be drawn from the lake of the Woods to the Miſſiſſippi, muſt paſs at a diſtance of ſeveral hundred miles from Michillimackinac. If the Britiſh, therefore, ſhould be
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:028389_0176_0FD8E888D22CAA08"/>diſpoſed to evade the ſurrender, they will ſeek for it ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text more plauſible than one which involves a palpable geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical abſurdity. Nor can we deſire a better proof of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or diſingenuouſneſs of the objectors to the treaty, than their having contrived one of this nature.</p>
                     <p>The general terms uſed, were to be preferred, for the very reaſon, that there was a doubt about the courſe of a part of the boundary line; for, if there ſhould chance to exiſt any poſt now unknown, ſo near the line as to render it queſtionable, in the firſt inſtance, on which ſide it may fall; the moment the line is ſettled, the obligation to ſurrender will be ſettled with it.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond objection loſes all force, when it is conſidered, that the exception can only operate till the firſt of June next, the period for the ſurrender of the poſts; and that, in the mean time, there is ample ſpace for ſettlement, without coming to diſputable ground. There was, beſides, real difficulty in an accurate definition. What the precincts and juriſdictions of the poſts are, is a queſtion of fact. In ſome inſtances, where, from there being no ſettlements, over which an actual juriſdiction had been exerciſed, a good rule might have been, the diſtance of gun ſhot from the fortifications, which might have been ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled at a certain extent in miles, ſay three or four. But in ſome caſes an actual juriſdiction has been exerciſed, under circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which created obſtacles to a preciſe definition. The caſe of Caldwell's manor, in the vicinity of Dutchman's point, is an example. There, a mixed juriſdiction has been ſometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed by the Britiſh, and by the ſtate of Vermont, connected with a diſputed title to that manor; one party claiming under an ancient French grant, and the other under the ſtate of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont. Detroit and its vicinity would alſo have occaſioned em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſment. From the ſituation of the ſettlements, and of a number of diſperſed trading eſtabliſhments, a latitude was likely to have been required, to which it might have been expedient to give a ſanction. In ſuch ſituations, where a thing is to laſt but a ſhort time, it is commonly the moſt eligible courſe, to avoid definition. It is obvious, that no ill can reſult from the want of one, if the poſts are ſurrendered at the time agreed; if not, it is equally plain, that it can be of no conſequence, becauſe the whole article will be void.</p>
                     <p>The third objection becomes inſignificant, the moment the real ſtate of things is adverted to. This has been deſcribed in a former number for another purpoſe, but will now be recapitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, with one or two additional facts. The firſt poſts, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning eaſtward, are, Point-au-fer and Dutchman's point, on like Champlain. The whole number of perſons in this vicinity,
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:028389_0177_0FD8E88D6BF7D048"/>over whom juriſdiction has been claimed by the Britiſh, may amount to an hundred families. But the claim of juriſdiction here, has been only occaſionally and feebly urged; and it is aſſorted in addition, by well informed perſons, that the ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned families have been, for ſome time, regularly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the legiſlature of Vermont, the ordinary civil juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which ſtate has, with little interruption, been extended over them. At neither of the other poſts, to wit, Oſweg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, Niagara, the Miami, Detroit, Michillimackinac, is there any ſettlement, except at Detroit, where, and in the vicinity of which, there may be between two and three thouſand perſons, chiefly French Canadians, and their deſcendants. It will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that I do not conſider as a ſettlement, two or three log houſes for traders.</p>
                     <p>It follows, that the number of perſons who can be embraced by the privileges ſtipulated, is too inconſiderable to admit of attaching any political conſequences whatever to the ſtipulation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Of what importance can it poſſibly be, to the United States, whether two or three thouſand perſons, men, women and children, are permitted to reſide within their limits, either as Britiſh or American ſubjects, at their option? If the thing was an object of deſire to Great Britain, for the accommodation of the individuals con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>erned, could it have merited a moment's heſitation on our part? As to reſidence, it is at the courteſy of nations at peace to permit the reſidence of the citizens of each other within their reſpective territories. Britiſh ſubjects are now free by our laws, to reſide in all parts of the United States. As to the permiſſion to become citizens, it has been the general policy and practice of our country to facilitate the naturaliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of foreigners. And we may ſafely count on the intereſt of individuals, and on that deſire to enjoy equal rights which is ſo deeply planted in the human breaſt, that all who reſolve to make their permanent reſidence with us, will become citizens.</p>
                     <p>It is true, that there may be a few obnoxious characters (though I do not recollect to have heard of more than two or three) among the number of thoſe who have acquired by the ſtipulation, a right to become citizens of the United States. But would it ever have been worthy of the dignity of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional wrath, to have launched its thunders againſt the heads of two, or three, or half a dozen deſpicable individuals? Can we ſuppoſe that, without a ſtipulation, it would have been thought worth the while to make a ſpecial exception of their caſes out of the operation of our general laws of naturalization? And if this had not been done, would they not have found means, if they deſired it, after the lapſe of a ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is to be obſerved, that citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of our own, who may have committed crimes againſt our laws, not remitted by the treaty of peace, would find no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection under this article.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſe the ſtipulation had not been made, what would have been the probable policy of the United States? Would it not have been to leave the handful of ſettlers undiſturbed, in quiet enjoyment of their property, and at liberty, if Britiſh ſubjects, to continue ſuch, or become American citizens, on the uſual conditions? A ſyſtem of depopulation, or of coercion to one allegiance or another, would have been little congenial with our modes of thinking, and would not, I am perſuaded, have been attempted.</p>
                     <p>If, then, the treaty only ſtipulates in this reſpect, what would have been the courſe of things without it, what cauſe for ſerious objection can there be on this account?</p>
                     <p>The matter of the fourth objection can only derive a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's importance from miſapprehenſion. It ſeems to have been imagined, that there are large tracts of land, held under Britiſh grants, made ſince the peace, which are confirmed by the part of the article that gives the inhabitants the right of removing with, ſelling, or <hi>retaining</hi> their property.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place, it is to be obſerved, that if ſuch grants had been made, the ſtipulation could not be deemed to confirm them; becauſe our laws muſt determine the queſtion, what is the property of the inhabitants; and they would rightfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, that the Britiſh government, ſince the treaty of peace, could make no valid grants of land, within our limits. Upon the ground even of its own pretenſions, it could not have made ſuch grants. Nothing more was claimed, than the right to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the poſts as a hoſtage. The right to grant lands pre-ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes much more, a full right of ſovereignty and territory.</p>
                     <p>But in the ſecond place, it has always been underſtood, and upon recent and careful enquiry is confirmed, <hi>that the Britiſh government has never, ſince the peace, made a grant of lands within our limits.</hi> It appears, indeed, to have been its policy, to prevent ſettlements in the vicinity of the poſts.</p>
                     <p>Hence the ſtipulation, as it affects lands, does nothing more than confirm the property of thoſe which were holden at the treaty of peace; neither is the quantity conſiderable; and it chiefly, if not altogether, depends on titles acquired under the French government, while Canada was a province of France.</p>
                     <p>In giving this confirmation, the treaty only purſues what is a conſtant rule among <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A contrary conduct would be diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to a nation; nor is it very reputable to the objectors to the treaty, that they have levelled their battery againſt this part of it. It is a reflection upon them too, that they employ for the purpoſe, terms which import more than is true, even on their own ſuppoſition, and are, therefore, calculated to deceive; for the confirmation of property to individuals, could be at moſt a ceſſion only of the right of ſoil, and not of territory, which term has a technical ſenſe, including juriſdiction.</p>
                     <p>Let it be added, that the treaty of peace, in the article which provides "that there ſhould be no future confiſcations nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions againſt any perſon or perſons, by reaſon of the part which he or they might have taken in the war; and that no perſon ſhould, on that account, ſuffer any future loſs or damage, either in his perſon, liberty or property," did ſubſtantially what is made an objection to the treaty, under conſideration. It will not, I believe, be diſputed, that it gave protection to all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty antecedently owned, and not confiſcated. Indeed it is a queſtion, whether the ſtipulations cited, would not have effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with regard to other rights than thoſe of property, a great part of what is regulated by the laſt treaty. Its proviſions, in this particular, were, perhaps, in the main, unneceſſary, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to obviate a doubt which might have ariſen from the ſuſpenſion of the treaty, by the withholding of the poſts.</p>
                     <p>Thus have I gone through every objection to the ſecond arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, which is in any degree colourable; and I flatter myſelf have ſhown not only that the acquiſition made by it, is of great and real value, but that it ſtands as well as circumſtances per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and is defenſible in its details. I have been the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

As an expedient of party, there is ſome merit in the artifice; but a ſenſible people will ſee that it is merely artifice. It is a falſe calculation, that the people of this country can ever be ultimately deceived.</p>

                     <p>THE object of the third article is connected with that of the ſecond. The ſurrender of the poſts naturally drew with it an arrangement, with regard to inland trade and navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. Such an arrangement, convenient in ſeveral reſpects, appears to be in ſome reſpects neceſſary. To reſtrain the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans on either ſide of the line, from trading with the one party or the other, at diſcretion, beſides the queſtionableneſs of the right, could not be attempted without rendering them diſguſted and hoſtile. The truth of this ſeems to have influenced the conduct of Great Britain and France, while the latter was in poſſeſſion of Canada. The 15th article of the treaty of peace of Utretcht, in the year 1713, allows free liberty to the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans on each ſide, to reſort for trade to the Britiſh and French colonies. It is to be obſerved, too, that the Indians not only asſiſt on a right of going to trade with whom they pleaſe, but of permitting whom they pleaſe to come to trade with them, and alſo to reſide among them for that purpoſe.—Thus, the ſouthern and ſouth-weſtern Indians within our limits, maintain a conſtant intercourſe with Spain, eſtabliſhed on the baſis of treaty—nor has their right to do it, been hitherto conteſted by the United States.—Indeed, on what clear principle of juſtice could this natural right of trade, of a people not ſubject to our ordinary juriſdiction, be diſputed? This claim, on their part, gives a correſponding claim to neighbouring nations, to trade with them. Spain would think the pretenſion to exclude her inadmiſſible—And Great Britain would have thought the ſame, if ſhe had found it her intereſt to aſſert the right of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe; views which would always be ſeconded by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians from regard to their own intereſt and independence. It was a point, therefore, which it much concerned the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of good underſtanding between the parties and with the Indians, to regulate on ſome equitable plan; and the more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral the plan, the more agreeable to a natural courſe of things, and to the free participation of mutual advantages, the more likely was it to promote and prolong that important benefit.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond place, the expediency of ſome arrangement was indicated by the circumſtance of the boundary line between the parties, running for an extent of ſixteen hundred miles through the middle of the ſame rivers, lakes, and waters. It may be deemed impoſſible from the varying courſe of winds and currents, for the ſhips of one party to keep themſelves conſtantly within their own limits. without paſſing or tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:028389_0181_0FD8E8974B8DD320"/>thoſe of the other. How, indeed, was the preciſe middle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>e of thoſe great lakes to be always known?</p>
                     <p>It appears evident, that to render the navigation of theſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> waters uſeful to, and ſafe for, both parties, it was requiſite that they ſhould become common. Without this, frequent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures to enforce interdictions of intercourſe might be incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red—and there would be conſtant danger of interference and controverſy. It is probable, too, that when thoſe waters are better explored in their whole extent, it will be found that the beſt navigation of thoſe lakes is ſometimes on the one ſide, ſometimes on the other, and that common convenience will, in this reſpect, alſo be promoted by community of right.</p>
                     <p>Again—It is almoſt always mutually beneficial for bordering territories to have free and friendly intercourſe with each other—This relates not only to the advantages of an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of commodities, for the ſupply of mutual wants, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>.— Proximity of territory invites to trade—the bordering inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, in ſpite of every prohibition, will endeavour to carry it on;—if not allowed, illicit adventures take place of the regular operations of legaliſed commerce—individual intereſt leads to colluſions to e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>de reſtraining regulations—habits of infracting the laws are produced—morals are perverted—ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, neceſſarily great, in proportion as they counteract the natural courſe of things, lay the foundation of diſcontents and quarrels. Perhaps it may be ſafely affirmed, that freedom of intercourſe, or violent hatred and enmity, are the alternative in every caſe of contiguity of territory.</p>
                     <p>The maxims of the United States have hitherto favored a free intercourſe with all the world. They have conceived, that they had nothing to fear from the unreſtrained competition of commercial enterprize, and have only deſired to be admitted to it on equal terms. Hence, not only the communication by ſea has been open, with the adjacent territories, on our conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, as well as with more diſtant quarte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Great Britain, in acceding to ſuch a plan, departed from her ſyſtem of colonial monopoly, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture which ought to be one recommendation of the plan to us; for every relaxation of that ſyſtem paves the way for other and further relaxations. It might have been expected, alſo, that a ſpirit of jealouſy might have proved an obſtacle on the part of Great Britain; ſince, eſpecially if we conſider the compoſition of thoſe who inhabit, and are likely to inhabit Canada, it is morally certain, that there muſt be, as the reſult of a free intercourſe, a far greater momentum of influence of the United States upon Canada, than of Canada upon the United States. It would not have been ſurpriſing, if this jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy had ſought to keep us at a diſtance, and had counteracted the wiſer policy of limiting our deſires by giving us poſſeſſion of what is alone to us truly deſirable, the advantages of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, rather than of ſuffering our wiſhes to be ſtimulated and extended by privation and reſtraint.</p>
                     <p>New ideas ſeem of late to have made their way among us. The extremes of commercial jealouſy are inculcated.—Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reſtriction, excluſion, are now with many the favorite topics—inſtead of feeling pleaſure, that new avenues of trade are opened, a thouſand dangers and miſchiefs are pourtrayed when the occaſion occurs. Free trade with all the world ſeems to have dwindled into trade with France and her dominions. The love-ſick partizans of that country appear to regard her as the epitome of the univerſe, to have adopted for their mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, "All for love, and the world well loſt."</p>
                     <p>Theſe new propenſities toward, commercial jealouſy, have been remarkably exemplified with reſpect to the article immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately under conſideration. Truly eſtimated, it is a valuable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient in the treaty; and yet there is, perhaps, no part of it which has been more ſeverely reprobated.—It will be eaſy to ſhow that it has been extremely miſrepreſented, and that what have been deemed very exceptionable features, do not exiſt at all.</p>
                     <p>We will firſt examine what the article really does contain, and afterwards what are the comparative advantages likely to reſult to the two countries.</p>

In what manner? by <hi>land</hi> and <hi>inland navigation:</hi> to what places? into the reſpective territories and countries of the two parties, on the continent of America (the country of the Hudſon's Bay company only excepted). They are alſo to navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate all the lakes, rivers, and <hi>waters thereof,</hi> and freely to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on trade and commerce with each other. This right to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigate lakes, rivers, and waters, muſt be underſtood with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to inland navigation; becauſe this gives it a ſenſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable with the antecedent clauſe, with which it is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately connected, as part of a ſentence; becauſe the right to <hi>paſs</hi> and <hi>repaſs,</hi> being expreſsly reſtricted to land and inland navigation, it would not be natural to extend it by implication, on the ſtrength of an ambiguous term, to paſſage by ſea, or by any thing more than inland navigation; becauſe the lakes and rivers have direct reference to inland navigation, ſhowing that to be the object in view; and the word "waters," from the order in which it ſtands, will moſt conſiſtently with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of compoſition, be underſtood as ſomething leſs than lakes and rivers, as ponds, canals, and thoſe amphibious wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to which it is ſcarcely poſſible to give a name; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the waters mentioned are "waters thereof," that is, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the territories and countries of the two parties on the continent of America; a deſcription which cannot very aptly be applied to the ſea, or be ſuppoſed to include navigation by ſea to the United States, or from them to the Britiſh territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. It is true, that nations, for various purpoſes, claim and exerciſe juriſdiction over the ſeas, immediately adjacent to their coaſts; yet this is ſubject to the common right of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to the innocent uſe of thoſe ſeas for navigation; and it is not, <hi>prima facie,</hi> preſumable, that two nations, ſpeaking of the waters of each other, would mean to give this appropriate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination to waters, in which both claimed ſome common right.—The uſual deſcription of ſuch waters in treaties is, "the <hi>

The above conſtruction is confirmed by the general com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of the treaty. It is the manifeſt province of the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen articles, which ſucceed the firſt ten, to regulate external commerce and navigation. The regulations they contain, are introduced thus, by the 11th article: "It is agreed between his majeſty and the United States of America, that there ſhall be a reciprocal and entirely perfect liberty of navigation and commerce, between their reſpective people, in the manner, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the limitations, and on the conditions ſpecified in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing articles."—Then follow articles, which provide fully and diſtinctly for trade and navigation between the United States and the Britiſh Weſt Indies, between the Aſiatic domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of Great Britain and the United States; and laſtly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the European dominions of Great Britain and the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States. Theſe eighteen articles properly conſtitute the treaty of commerce and navigation between the two countries. Their general ſcope, and ſome ſpecial proviſions which they contain, prove that the object of the third article is local and partial; that it contemplates excluſively, an interior commerce, by land and inland navigation (except as to the Miſſiſſippi) and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly that it does not reach at all our Atlantic ports. An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of one of the ſpecial proviſions alluded to, will be cited in the further examination of this article.</p>
                     <p>In oppoſition to this conſtruction, much ſtreſs is laid upon the proviſions which immediately ſucceed the clauſes that have been quoted. They are in theſe words: "But it is underſtood, that this article does not extend to the admiſſion of veſſels of the United States into the ſeaports, harbours, bays, or creeks of his majeſty's ſaid territories, nor into ſuch parts of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in his ſaid territories as are between the mouth thereof, and the higheſt port of entry from the ſea, except in ſmall veſſels trading bona ſide between Montreal and Quebec: nor to the admiſſion of Britiſh veſſels from the ſea, into the rivers of the United States, beyond the higheſt ports of entry for foreign veſſels from the ſea!" The laſt, it is ſaid, contains an implica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that under this article, Britiſh veſſels have a right to come to our higheſt ports of entry for foreign veſſels from the ſea, while we are excluded from the ſeaports of the Britiſh territories on this continent.</p>
                     <p>But this is altogether an erroneous inference. The clauſes laſt cited are inſerted for greater caution, to guard expreſſively againſt any conſtruction of the article, by implications more or leſs remote; contrary to the actual regulations of the parties, with regard to external commerce and navigation.

<pb n="186" facs="unknown:028389_0185_0FD8BE9217AEA710"/>She therefore declares that the article ſhall not be deemed to contravene this regulation. The United States now permit ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign veſſels to come to certain ports of entry from the ſea, but exclude them from other more interior ports of entry, to which our own veſſels may come.<note n="*" place="bottom">An example of this is ſound in the ſtate of New York.

This was the more proper, as the right of inland navigation might have given ſome colour to the claim of going from an outer to an inner port of entry. But this negative of an implication <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> which might have found ſome colour in the principal provaſion, can never be conſtrued into an affumative grant of a very important privilege, foreign to that principal proviſion. The main object of the article, it has been ſeen, is trade by land, and inland navigation. Trade and navigation by ſea, with our ſea ports, is an entirely diflerent thing. To inſer a poſitive grant of this privilege, from a clauſe which ſays, that the right of inland navigation ſhall not be conſtrued to permit veſſels coming from the ſea, to go from the ports of entry, to which our laws now reſtrict them, to more interior ports, would be contrary to reaſon, and to every rule of ſound conſtruction. Such a privilege could never be permitted to be founded upon any thing leſs than a poſitive and explicit grant. It could never be ſupported by an implication drawn from an article relative to a local and partial object, much leſs by an implication drawn from the negative of another implication. The pretenſion, that all our ports were laid open to Great Britain by a covert and ſide-wind proviſion, and this without reciprecity, without a right of acceſs to a ſingle ſea port of the other party in any part of the world, would be too monſtrous to be tolerated for an inſtant. The principles of equity between nations, and the eſtabliſhed rules of interpretation, would unite to condemn ſo great an inequality, if any other ſenſe could poſſibly be found for the terms from which it might be protended to be deduced. It would be in the preſent caſe the more inadmiſſible, becauſe the object is embraced and regulated by other parts of the treaty on terms of reciprocity.</p>
                     <p>The different mode of expreſſion, in the clauſe laſt cited, when ſpeaking of the Britiſh territories, and when ſpeaking of the United States, has furniſhed an argument for the inference which has been ſtated. But this difference is accounted for by
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:028389_0186_0FD8E8A5B390E1C8"/>the difference in the actual regulations of the parties, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed above.

                     <p>The only poſitive effect of theſe clauſes is to eſtabliſh, that the navigation from Montreal to Quebec, ſhall be carried on in what are called "ſmall veſſels, trading bone ſide between Montreal and Quebec."

This is more a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration that the antecedent proviſions were not ſo broad as to comprehend the caſes, than an exception of the caſes from the operation of thoſe proviſions.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who are not familiar with laws and treaties, may feel ſome difficulty about the poſition, that particular clauſes are introduced, only for greater caution, without producing any new effect; but thoſe who are familiar with ſuch ſubjects, know, that there is ſcarcely a law or a treaty which does not offer examples of the uſe of ſimilar clauſes; and it not unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently happens, that a clear meaning of the principal proviſion is rendered obſcure by the exceſs of explanatory precaution.</p>
                     <p>The next clauſe of this article is an exception to the general deſign of it, condfirming the conſtruction I have given.

                     <p>If the general proviſion gives acceſs to all our ports, which muſt be the doctrine, if it gives acceſs to our Atlantic ports, then it would equally have this effect with regard to the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſſippi.

                     <p>I ſhall conclude this paper with an obſervation or two on the meaning of the terms, inland navigation. Theſe terms have no technical meaning defined in the laws of either coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, nor have they any preciſe meaning aſſigned by the law of nations. They, however, <hi>ex vi termini,</hi> exclude navigation from the ſea; and as a general rule, I ſhould ſay, that inland navigation begins there, where ſea navigation ends. Where is this? I anſwer, at the ports of entry from the ſea. By the laws of Great Britain and of the United States, all rivers are arms of the ſea as far as the tides flow—It would be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this principle, that ſea navigation would reach to the head of tide water. But ſome more obvious and notorious rule ought to govern the interpretation of national compacts. The ports of entry from the ſea are conceived to be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per rule.</p>
                     <p>In the caſe under conſideration, the general ſpirit of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle may require, that all the waters which divide the territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the parties ſhould be in their whole extent common to both.—As to other communicating waters, acceſſible under the article, the reciprocal limit of the right will be the ports of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try from the ſea. This is to be underſtood with the exception of the Miſſiſſippi, to the ports of which, acceſs from the ſea is granted under the qualification which has been pointed out.</p>

                     <p>THE foregoing analyſis of the third article, by fixing its true meaning, enables us to detect ſome groſs errors, which have been principal ſources of prejudice againſt it.— One of theſe is, that the article gives to the other party a right of acceſs to all our ports, while it excludes us from the ports of the Britiſh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="192" facs="unknown:028389_0191_0FD8E8B18E30C060"/>been clearly ſhown, that it gives no right of acceſs to any one of our Atlantic ports, and that it gives only a qualified and conditional acceſs to the ports which we may have on the Miſſiſſippi, to be regulated by the privileges at any time allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by law or compact in our Atlantic ports, and liable to ceaſe with the ceſſation of thoſe privileges.—The charge, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, of want of reciprocity in this particular, vaniſhes, and with it all the exceptionable conſequences which have been the fruit of the error. Such is the aſſertion of DECIUS, that a Britiſh trader may ſet out from Canada, traverſe our lakes, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and waters to New York, and thence to Philadelphi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Such, alſo, is the aſſertion of CATO, that Great Britain is admitted to all the advantages of which our Atlantic rivers are ſuſceptible. The rivers, upon which no part of their territory borders, and which their veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels can only approach by ſea, are certainly excepted.</p>
                     <p>Another of the errors referred to, is this, that goods and merchandize may, under this article, be imported into any <hi>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It has been clearly proved, that there is no pretence for this poſition, and that equality of duties c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ly applies to importations from the Britiſh territories, in our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, by land and inland navigation.</p>
                     <p>CATO, DECIUS, and other writers againſt the treaty, have fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en into this ſtrange error, and have founded upon it much angry declamation. The firſt, however, embarraſſed in his conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the proviſion which reſerves to Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Whatever may be the caſe with regard to the latter, the former, he is convinced, are certainly entitled to admiſſion into our Atlantic ports, on the privileged rights of duty; though he is very naturally perplexed to ſee how the diſcrimination could be maintained in practice. But where does he find room for this diſtinction? Not in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

The goods and merchandize, for the privileged importation of which at provides, are reſtricted to no particular object—have no ſpecial reference to Indian more than to other trade: on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they are expreſsly to be imported for "the purpoſes of commerce" at large; ſo that in the caſes in which they are privileged, they are equally ſo, whether it be for a trade with our citizens or with Indians. The diſtinction therefore, only proves the embarraſſment of its inventor, without ſolving the difficulty. A curious aſſertion has been made on this article of duties. It has been ſaid, that while we are obliged to admit Britiſh goods on the ſame duties with thoſe paid by our own citizens, or importation in our own veſſels, Great Britain, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the right to lay, countervailing duties, may incumber us with an additional ten per cent. Can any thing be more abſurd than the poſition, that the right to lay <hi>countervailing</hi> duties ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts in a caſe, where there is no difference of duty to <hi>counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail?</hi> The term is manifeſtly a relative one, and can only ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate where there is ſomething on our ſide to be countervailed or counterbalanced, and in an exact ratio to it. If it be true, that a very high law character is the writer of CATO, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be ſurpriſed at ſuch extreme inaccuracy.</p>
                     <p>Other errors, no leſs conſiderable, will appear in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the examination; but it will facilitate the detection of theſe, and tend to a more thorough underſtanding of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, to ſtate in this place ſome general facts, which are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial in a compariſon of the advantages and diſadvantages of the article, to the reſpective parties.</p>
                     <p n="1">1ſt. The fur trade within our limits is, to the fur trade with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Britiſh limits, as one to ſeven, nearly; that is, the trade with the Indians, on the Britiſh ſide of the boundary line, is about ſeven times greater than the ſame trade on our ſide of that line. This fact is ſtated as the reſult of repeated enquiry from well informed perſons for ſeveral years paſt. It will not appear extraordinary to thoſe who recollect how much the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians on our ſide are circumſcribed in their hunting-grounds, and to what a degree they are reduced in numbers by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent wars, in which they have been engaged with us: while the tribes on the Britiſh ſide of the line are not only far more numerous, but enjoy an immenſe undiſturbed range of wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The more rapid progreſs of ſettlement on our ſide than on the other, will faſt mereaſe the exiſting diſparity.</p>
                     <p n="2">2d. Our communication with the ſea is more eaſy, ſafe, and expeditious, than that of Canada, by the St. Law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ence. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:028389_0193_0FD8E8B60C917010"/>while our veſſels ordinarily make two voyages in a year, to and from Europe, the Britiſh veſſels, in the Canada trade, are, from the courſe of the ſeaſons, and the nature of the navigation, confined to one voyage in a year. Though hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, from temporary circumſtances, this difference has not made any ſenſible difference in the price of tranſportation; yet in its permanent operation, it is hardly poſſible that it ſhould not give us a material advantage in the competition for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of European goods to a large part of Canada, eſpecially that which is denominated Upper Canada. The city of Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, diſtant 124 miles from the city of New York, is as near to the junction of the river Cataraquy and lake Ontario, as Montreal, which laſt is near four hundred miles diſtant from the mouth of the St. Lawrence. When the canals, now in rapid execution, are completed, there will be water communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation the whole way from the city of Hudſon to Ontario.</p>
                     <p n="3">3d. The ſupply of Eaſt India goods to Canada, is likely to be always eaſier and cheaper through us, than in any other way. According to the preſent Britiſh ſyſtem, Canada is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied through Britain. It is obvious how much the charges of this double voyage muſt enhance the prices of the articles, when delivered in Canada. A direct trade between the Eaſt Indies and Canada, would ſuppoſe a change in the Britiſh ſyſtem, to which there are great obſtacles; and even then, there are circumſtances which would ſecure to us an advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous competition.—It is a fact, which ſerves to illuſtrate our advantages, that Eaſt India articles, including teas, are, upon an average, cheaper in the United States than in England.</p>
                     <p>The facts demonſtrate that a trade between us and the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh territories in our neighbourhood, upon equal terms as to privilege, muſt afford a balance of advantages on our ſide. As to the fur trade, for a participation in one eighth of the whole, which we concede, we gain a participation in ſeven-eighths which is conceded to us. As to the European and Eaſt India trade, we acquire the right of competition upon equal terms of privilege with real and conſiderable advantages of ſituation.</p>
                     <p>The ſtipulation with regard to equal duties, was eſſential to the preſervation of our ſuperiority of advantages in this trade, while it would not interfere with the general policy of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation, concerning the difference of duties on goods import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our own and in foreign bottoms; becauſe the ſupplies which can come to us through Canada, for the reaſons already given, muſt be inconſiderable—becauſe, alſo, di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="195" facs="unknown:028389_0194_0FD8E8BC119DE340"/>laſt place, this difference is not very ſenſible, owing to the large proportion of goods which are imported in the names of our own citizens. I ſay nothing here of the practicability, on general grounds, of long maintaining with effect this regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Is it not wonderful, conſidering the real ſtate of the trade, as depending on locality, that the treaty ſhould be charged with ſacrificing the fur trade to the Britiſh? If there be any ſacrifice, is it not on their ſide: when the fact is, that the quantity of trade in which they admit us to equal privileges is ſeven times greater than that in which we admit them to equal privileges?</p>
                     <p>The arguments againſt the treaty on this point, are not only full of falſity, but they are in contradiction with each other.</p>
                     <p>On the one hand, it is argued that our communication from the ſea, with the Indian country, being much eaſier than by the St. Lawrence, we could furniſh Engliſh goods cheaper, and of courſe could have continued the Indian trade in its uſual channel, even from the Britiſh ſide of the lakes; nor could they have prevented it, without giving ſuch diſguſt to the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as would have made them dangerous neighbours.—On the other hand, it is argued, that from ſuperiority of capital, better knowledge of the trade, a better eſtabliſhed connection of cuſtomers, the Britiſh will be able to ſupplant us, even in our own territories, and to acquire a monopoly of the whole fur trade.</p>
                     <p>Propoſitions ſo oppoſite cannot all be true. Either the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed faculty of ſupplying Engliſh goods cheaper, which, it is ſaid, would give as a command of the Indian trade, even on the Britiſh ſide of the lakes, not in the power of the Britiſh to prevent, overbalances the advantages which are ſpecified on the other ſide, or it does not—If it does not, then it is not true, that it could draw to us the trade from the Britiſh ſide of the lakes—If it does, then it is not true, that the Britiſh can ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant us in the trade on either ſide the lakes; much leſs that they can obtain a monopoly of it on both ſides.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, if it be true that the Britiſh could not prevent out trading with the Indians on their ſide, without giving them ſuch diſguſt as to make them dangerous to their neighbours; why is it not equally true, that we could not prevent their trading with the Indians on our ſide, without producing a ſimilar effect?—And if they have re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>tity of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, why would they not, on the principle of this argument, attract and divert the trade from us, though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

<pb n="196" facs="unknown:028389_0195_0FD8E8BD25C641F0"/>trade with the Indians in each other's territories had not been ſtipulated?</p>
                     <p>The difficulty of reſtraining the Indians from trading at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, is an idea well founded, as has been admitted in another place.—But there reſult from it, ſtrong arguments in favor of reciprocation of privileges in the Indian trade, by treaty. One of them, its tendency to preſerve peace and good underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, has been already noticed; another ariſes from the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that it will probably be the policy of the Britiſh to maintain larger military eſtabliſhments on their frontier, than we ſhall think eligible on ours, which will render it proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably more eaſy to them to reſtrain their Indians, than it will be to us to reſtrain ours. This greater difficulty of excuting reſtraints on our ſide, is a powerful reaſon for us to agree, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, to throw open the door.</p>
                     <p>It will not be ſurpriſing, if, upon ſome other occaſion, the adverſaries of the treaty ſhould abandon their own ground, and inſtead of ſaying the treaty is faulty, for what it ſtipulates on this point, ſhould affirm, merely that it has no merit on this account, ſince it only does what the diſpoſition of the Indians would have brought about without it—But it is always a merit to diveſt an advantageous thing of cauſe of diſpute, and to fix, by amicable agreement, a benefit which otherwiſe would be liable to litigation, oppoſition, and interruption.</p>
                     <p>As to relative advantages for carrying on the trade, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon ought to be made with caution. That which has been ſtated on our ſide, namely, greater facility in conveying the materials of the trade from Europe to the ſcene where it is to be carried on, is a real one, and in proceſs of time may be expected to make itſelf to be felt; yet hitherto, as before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, it has had no ſenſible effect.</p>
                     <p>Of the advantages which have been ſtated as belonging to the other ſide, there is but one which has ſubſtance, and this is previous poſſeſſion of the ground. But even this, from the very nature of it, is temporary—With our uſual enterpriſe and induſtry, it will be aſtoniſhing if we do not ſpeedily ſhare the ground to the full extent of our relative advantages.</p>
                     <p>As to ſuperiority of capital, it amounts to nothing. It has been ſeen, that the capital requiſite for the whole trade is ſmall. From a hundred to a hundred and fifty thouſand pounds ſterling would be a high ſtatement.—The whole of this, if we were to monopolize the entire trade, could not create a moment's embarraſſment to find it, in the opinion of any man who attends to the great pecuniary operations which are daily going on in our country. But that very capital which it
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:028389_0196_0FD8E8BECECEEC90"/>repreſented as our rival, could be brought into action for our benefit in this very trade. The ſolution is ſimple. Our credit will command it in obtaining the foreign articles, neceſſary for the trade, upon as good terms as the Britiſh merchants who now carry it on. The ſame objection of ſuperiority of capital may with as much reaſon be applied to any other branch of trade between us and Great Britain. Why does it not give her a monopoly of the direct trade between her European do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions and the United States? The argument, if valid, would prove that we ought to have no commerce, not only with Great Britain, but with any nation which has more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial capital than ourſelves.</p>
                     <p>As to ſuperior knowledge of the particular branch of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, there is ſtill leſs force in that argument. It is not a caſe of abſtruſe ſcience or complicated combination. And we are in no want of perſons among us, who are experimentally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>As to cuſtomers for the proceeds of the trade, we ſhould ſtand upon as good a footing as the Britiſh merchants. What we did not want for our own conſumption, might be ſent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on equal terms to the very markets to which they ſend theirs; and to others which might be found preferable, becauſe leſs well ſupplied with the kind of articles.</p>
                     <p>As to whatever may depend on enterpriſe, we need not fear to be out-done by any people on earth. It may almoſt be ſaid, that enterpriſe is our element.</p>
                     <p>It has been alleged, that our trade with the Indians would be interrupted by bad ſeaſons and occaſional wars, while that of Great Britain would be ſteady and uniform. As to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualties of ſeaſons, it is evident they muſt fall upon Great Britain as much as upon us, unleſs we ſuppoſe the elements in conſpiracy againſt us; and as to wars, the poſſeſſion of the poſts would eſſentially change our ſituation, and render it pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly advantageous for preventing or repreſſing hoſtilities; ſo that with equally good management, our territories would not be more expoſed than the Britiſh.</p>
                     <p>But the intrigues of the Britiſh traders reſiding among our Indians, would excite them to hoſtility. It could not be the private intereſt of the traders to do this; becauſe, beſides be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amenable to puniſhment, if diſcovered—beſides, that both the traders and the Indians within our limits, by the poſſeſſion of the poſts, would be under our controul—wars interrupt of courſe the hunting of the Indians, and ſo deſtroy their means of trading.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="198" facs="unknown:028389_0197_0FD8E8BFD3E86F80"/>
As to Great Britain, ſhe never could have had but one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to prompt Indian hoſtilities, that was, to induce the United States to relinquiſh a part of their boundary. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the poſts will put an end to this project. In regard to trade, ſhe and her traders will have a common intereſt with us, and our traders, to keep all the Indians at peace, for the reaſon aſſigned above. This intereſt will be the ſtronger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the beſt communication even with her own Indians, will be partly through our territery; and it would be impoſſible that it ſhould not be impeded and interrupted by the operations of war between us and the Indians In fact, under the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of common privileges, there is every poſſible link of common intereſt between us and Great Britain in the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of peace with the Indians.</p>
                     <p>In this queſtion of danger to our peace by the Britiſh parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation in the trade with our Indians, the difficulty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining the Indians from trading with whom they pleaſe (which is admitted by the argument of both ſides) is a very material conſideration. Would there not be greater hazard to our peace from the attempts of the Britiſh to participate in a trade from which we endeavoured to exclude them, ſeconded by the diſcontents of the Indians, than from any diſpoſitions to ſupplant us, when allowed a free competition, when as cauſe of diſſatisfaction was given to the Indians, and when it was certain, that war muſt interfere with their means of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the trade? The ſecurity for our peace appears to be much greater in the latter, than in the former ſtate of things.</p>
                     <p>A ſuſpicion is alſo ſuggeſted, that Great Britain, without exciting war, will indirectly trammel and obſtruct our trade. To objections which ſuppoſe a want of fair dealing in the other party, it is very difficult to anſwer. All that a treaty can do, is to eſtabliſh principles which are likely to operate well, if well executed. It is no objection to its merits, that the benefits aimed at may be fruſtrated by ill faith. The utility of any compact between nations muſt preſume a ſincere execution. The reverſe may diſappoint the beſt conceived plan: and the ſecurity againſt it muſt be the mutual intereſt to perform, and the power of retaliation. If Great Britain acts with infidelity or chicanery towards us, we muſt retract the privileges granted on our ſide.</p>
                     <p>Another objection which is made, is, that while the Britiſh would have a right to reſide among us, to hire houſes and warehouſes, and to enjoy every convenience for proſecuting the trade ſyſtematically, we ſhould not be entitled to ſimilar privileges with them, having only a right to paſs "like pedlars
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:028389_0198_0FD8E8C14FE580F8"/>with our ſhops upon our backs." Theſe are the expreſſions of CATO.</p>
                     <p>The poſition is founded on that clauſe of the Britiſh act of navigation, which forbids any but a natural born or naturalized ſubject to exerciſe the occupation of a merchant or factor, in any of the Britiſh dominions in Aſia, Africa and America.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place, it is to be obſerved, that as far as the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle under diſcuſſion is ſingly concerned, there is no pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ence to ſay, that one party has greater rights as to r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ce than the other. If, therefore, Great Britain can prevent our citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens reſiding in their territories in our neighbourhood, we are free by this article to apply to them a ſimilar exe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ſion. And any right of reſidence which may be claimed under any other part of the treaty, will be temporary.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond place, the prohibition of reſidence in the act of navigation, proceeds on the ground of excluding foreigners from carrying on trade in the territories to which it extends. But the third article expreſsly gives us a right freely to carry on trade and commerce with the Britiſh territories on this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, a right which neceſſarily includes the privilege of reſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as merchants and factors. For wherever an END is granted, the <hi>uſual</hi> and <hi>proper means</hi> of enjoying it, are implied in the grant. Reſidence is a uſual and neceſſary mean of freely carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on trade. Without it, the right to trade becomes eſſentially nugatory. This reaſoning has peculiar force in relation to inland trade. And it agrees with deciſions at common law, and with the opinion of Lord Coke, who tells us that "of an houſe for <hi>habitation</hi> an alien merchant may take a <hi>leaſe for years, as inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to commerce; for without habitation be cannot merchandize or trade."</hi> This, among other things, he informs us, was reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all the judges aſſembled for that purpoſe, in the caſe of ſir James Croſt, in the reign of queen Elizabeth; and we learn from it, that the right to hire houſes and warehouſes is deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the right to trade, as its incident. The ſame princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>,</hi> has been recognized in other caſes.</p>
                     <p>The whole of the article is an innovation upon the Britiſh act of navig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tion. Being abrogated as to the principal thing, there is no difficulty in ſuppoſing it ſo as to incidents; on the other hand, to pretend to exclude us from the right of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence, could not be deemed a fair execution of the article. Hence we find, that the want of reciprocity in this particular, alſo fails, and with it the ſuppoſed diſadvantage on our ſide in the ſuppoſed competition for the trade.</p>

                  <p>WE, the underſigned citizens of the United States, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Baltimore town, beg leave reſpectfully to repreſent, that the treaty lately negociated with Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and announced to us through the public prints, has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited in our minds the moſt ſerious apprehenſion and alarm for the intereſt and ſafety of our commerce, the rights of our fellow citizens, and the dignity of our government. Under theſe impreſſions, convinced as we are, of your unremitting concern for the intereſt and happineſs of America, we think it our duty to diſcloſe to you, freely, our ſentiments on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, leſt our ſilence might be interpreted into an approval of the act, and to prevent, as far as the influence of our opinions may operate, a ratification of it.</p>
                  <p>A treaty that profeſſes to eſtabliſh a firm, laſting, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable peace, and ſincere friendſhip between the contracting parties, without referring to their reſpective complaints, and as far as may be, removing them, wants that evidence of a paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:028389_0200_0FD8E8CB20F04040"/>diſpoſition which is neceſſary to give it effect; and leaves room for doubts and jealouſies incompatible with its object:— In this reſpect, the treaty with Great Britain appears eſſentially defective: our complaints are not redreſſed, nor is ſuch effectual proviſion made for removing them, as might have been under every circumſtance of the caſe; and which juſtice and good faith required ſhould have been made.—Our territory and fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier poſts, the ſubject of frequent reclamation, and held in riolation of a former treaty, are to be ſurrendered at an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarily diſtant period—a remote hope of recovery, after much expenſe and perplexity in the uſual mode of legal proceedings, and much injury from the depreciation of their capitals, is the only compenſation procured for our ſuffering merchauts, who have been unjuſtly depreived of their property in the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a fair trade; nor has any effectual proviſion been made to remedy the evil or prevent future ſpoliations of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, under like frivolous pretexts.—No reſtitution whatever is made or contemplated to be made, for a large amount of property, carried off from the ſouthern ſtates, contrary to the late treaty of peace.—Our ſeamen, citizens of the United States, arbitrarily and unjuſtly take from our ſhips and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained on board Britiſh ſhips of war are not reſtored; nor is any ſecurity contemplated againſt future aggreſſions of the ſame kind. Proper conceſſions on theſe points, and proviſions of ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate remedy for theſe evils, would have been indicative of a juſt and friendly diſpoſition, and ought, we conceive, to have accompanied the act of ratification.</p>
                  <p>But we have other objections to the treaty. It contemplates an inconſiſtent eſtabliſhment or colony of men within the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and juriſdiction of the United States, enjoying ſome of the moſt important privileges of citizens, but exempt from the burdens, and owing no allegiance to its government. Many miſchiefs, we conceive, might reſult from ſuch an eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; among which, from the evident want of reciprocity, in the advantages of navigation ceded in the lakes, and other weſtern waters, may juſtly be apprehended, the monopoly of a lucrative fur trade, by this deſcription of ſettlers. From the admiſſion of Britiſh ſhips to be the carriers of our bulky pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts, on terms of perfect equality with our own, we antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate a material loſs in the value of our ſhipping; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, a great injury to a numerous claſs of people employed in ſhip-building, and in the manufacture of cordage, iron, and other articles, neceſſary to this extenſive branch of buſineſs; and we fear what is contemplated as an equivalent for this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ſacrifice, will not be found ſuch in fact.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="202" facs="unknown:028389_0201_0FD8E8CC95B90CE8"/>
We cannot view but with the moſt lively concern and regret, that article of the treaty, which authorizes the ſeizure of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies' property in neutral ſhips. This is a ceſſion of vaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to America as a trading nation. Situate as ſhe is, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the powers of Europe; pacific in the temper and diſpoſition of her citizens, and in the principles of her govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſhe is not likely to be embroiled in wars. The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, then, that would reſult from her being the carrier of property for the contending nations, are too evident to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire elucidation, and too important to be given up without an equivalent. The principle of free ſhips making free goods has been formally acknowledged by the government of the United States to other neutral powers, when ſhe was engaged in war—It has been granted to her by treaties with different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: it has long been contended for, and has been acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by ſeveral of the reſpectable powers of Europe. By giving up this point, to a nation ſo frequently engaged in wars, we give our conſent to the moſt vexatious and injurious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions on our commerce, and of our national rights as a neutral nation, without any thing that can be called an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent.</p>
                  <p>America is not in a condition, to benefit by the apparent reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procity in this article of the treaty; nor likely ſoon to be in a ſituation that will require it.</p>
                  <p>We have doubts of the policy, on our part, of agreeing to that article which precludes the United States from entering into treaties, inconſiſtent with ſome of its proviſions, whereby America would be prevented from a renewal of her beneficial treaties, exiſting with the French Republic, and other European powers; and from making ſuch other treaties at any future period, as may be deemed adviſeable.</p>
                  <p>To enumerate minutely, the many evils which may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended from a treaty, ſo partial and unequal in is proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and wherein man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nor do we conceive, that we ſhall by this treaty be more ſecure in our commerce than neutral veſſels were by the law of nations under the recognition of our independence; nor can we extend our credulity in the faith of that nation ſo far, as to ſuppoſe that our naval commerce will be leſs abridged by them, or our ſeamen leſs expoſed to inſult than heretofore, unleſs we wholly relinquiſh all trade with her enemies a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>If the horrors of war, which we ſincerely deprecate, are to be ſet in competition with the loſs of our natural rights and privileges, we are not able to diſtinguiſh the advantages to be derived from a treaty which ſubmits them, rather than to have them taken from us without. The latter ſeems to us preferable; as in that caſe, whenever we thought fit and proper, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances were favorable, we might aſſert our right without being ſtared in the face by a treaty that had previouſly reſigned them. Beſides, ſtipulations ſo manifeſtly unjuſt and unequal (though the temper and circumſtances of the moment may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a ratification) will not fail to be a continued ſource of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction and complaint, and produce mutual infractions of the treaty, and moſt probably will accelerate rather than retard hoſtilities between the contracting parties.</p>

                  <p>EVERY time I read the treaty, new objections occur, or old ones penetrate deeper into the ſubject. Did you ever obſerve the effect of the latter clauſe of the 7th article, as it aſſerts a claim on the part of the United States againſt France for whatever ſhall be paid under it to Great Britain? In Mr. Jefferſon's letter to Mr. Genet, he ſays "Unleſs veſſels captured as the 7th article ſtates, ſhall be reſtored, if the United States make compenſation for them, they will conſider the ſums paid as autho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

It is remembered, that Genet aſſerted a right on the part of France, to arm privateers in our ports, under the French treaty. This diſpute has never been adjuſted between the United States and France; when then the treaty ſurrenders to Great Britain an equivalent for the captures made by French veſſels, in order to charge France with the amount of that equivalent, not to apprize our friend and ally, that ſuch a circumſtance was meditated before it was agreed to, is an unjuſt procedure towards France, and tends to involve us in a diſagreeable altercation with that nation.</p>

                  <p>AS various miſrepreſentations have already been made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the vote taken at the town meeting, held at the ſtate-houſe in Trenton, on Thurſday the 13th inſt. and though the account thereof [See page 128.] ſo far as it goes, contains the truth; yet not the whole truth, it is deemed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to publiſh the following as a true and incontrovertible ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the proceedings which took place with regard to the reſolution adopted at the meeting.—</p>
                  <p>At a numerous and reſpectable meeting of the citizens of Trenton and its vicinity, aſſembled on the 13th Auguſt, at the ſtate-houſe,</p>
                  <p>Aaron Woodruff in the chair,</p>
                  <p>General Frederick Frelinghuyſen, one of the ſenators of this ſtate in the congreſs of the United States, attended, and, at the requeſt of the citizens preſent, conſented to give his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the treaty pending between the United States and Great Britain.</p>
                  <p>The following reſolution was then moved by the Rev. Mr. Armſtong, and ſeconded by Mr. C. ſt</p>
                  <p>"Reſolved, That this meeting have the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lleſt confidence in the honor, virtue and integrity of the ſaid Frederick Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linghuyſen —that this meeting are fully of opinion, that in vot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſaid treaty, he acted on the pureſt principle of patriot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm; and that the thanks of this meeting be given to him, for the candor with which he has ſtated the reaſons which induced him to vote for the ſaid treaty."</p>
                  <p>This reſolution was objected to by Mr. Mott and Mr. Throck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morton, upon the principle, that it might be deemed by the public as an implied contradiction <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o the vote of the former town meetings, diſapproving of the ſaid treaty—which contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction it was evident this meeting did not mean to make; that all that was intended, was to acquit Gen. Frelinghuyſen of the implication (which, it was conceived, had been conveyed by the reſolution of the former town meeting) of a want of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence, integrity, and patriotiſm; and ſo far, and no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was this meeting willing to go.</p>
                  <p>It was anſwered by Mr. R. Stockton, that nothing more was meant or intended; and that, from a view of the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it could not poſſibly be taken to be a contradiction of the vote of the former meetings, in diſapprobation of the treaty.—
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:028389_0207_0FD8E8DFEDD8A220"/>Mr. Craft, in particular, declared, that if he could imagine that it could be conſtrued in any manner to contradict the vote of the former meeting, he ſhould hardly have been ſo inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with himſelf as to have ſeconded the motion; and that he would ſtill vote againſt it with all his heart; for that Gen. Frelinghuyſen had not convinced him that he was wrong; and he believed that every perſon preſent remained of his former opinion—but he did not think the reſolution carried the impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation held up—it went no further than to acquit the General of an imputation (which nobody ever meant to make) that he had voted for the treaty under an undue or improper influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>In reply, it was obſerved, that if nothing more was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there could be no reaſon againſt ſtating the reſolution in ſuch terms as to avoid all doubt about the meaning.</p>
                  <p>But it was inſiſted on by Mr. R. Stockton, and ſeveral others, that the queſtion ſhould be put upon the reſolution a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> it ſtood.</p>
                  <p>The queſtion was accordingly put by the chairman, and <hi>loſt by a very large majority.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereupon it was moved by Mr. Throckmorton, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by Mr. Craft, that the reſolution be amended ſo as to read as follows, viz.</p>
                  <p>Reſolved <hi>(without reference to the merits of the ſaid treaty)</hi> that this meeting have the fulleſt confidence in the honor, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and integrity of the ſaid Frederick Frelinghuyſen—that this meeting are fully of opinion that in voting for the ſaid treaty, he was actuated by the pureſt principles of patriotiſm, and that the thanks of this meeting be given to him, for the candor with which he has ſtated the reaſons which induced him to vote for the ſaid treaty.</p>
                  <p>And the queſtion being put upon the reſolution, as amended, it was agreed to.</p>
                  <p>After this ſtatement of facts (which no perſon of candor can contradict) the public are left to judge of the truth of the repreſentations which have been made, with regard to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the meeting; and what would have become of the only vote that the friends of the treaty thought proper to attempt, had it not been for the conciliating diſpoſition mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly diſcovered by two or three of the very perſons moſt ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly oppoſed to the treaty, of which deſcription of perſons, it is believed, there was a majority of four to one.</p>

                  <p>WHEREAS at a general town-meeting of the citizens of Trenton and its vicinity, convened at the ſtate-houſe, on Wedneſday the 29th July, 1795, purſuant to public notice given, "for the purpoſe of taking into conſideration meaſures proper to be purſued upon the ſubject of the pend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing treaty between Great Britain and the United States," it was, among other things, unanimouſly reſolved, "That it is the conſtitutional right and patriotic duty of the citizens of the United States, to expreſs, on every important occaſion, the public ſenſe of public meaſures." It was further reſolved (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a diſſenting voice) "that it is at this time, in a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the bounden duty of every friend to his country, to expreſs the public opinion upon an inſtrument, ſo extraordinary and momentous in its nature as the treaty of amity, navigation and commerce, lately projected between lord Grenville, on the part of Great Britain, and John Jay, envoy extraordinary, on the part of the United States; —degrading to the national honor —dangerous to the public intereſt—and deſtructive of the agricultural and commercial views of the United States."—It was further reſolved (without a diſſenting voice) "That the citizens of Trenton and its vicinity, having heard a full diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon the ſubject of the treaty, do, upon the moſt cool and diſpaſſionate conſideration, diſapprove of the ſaid treaty, and hope, by this public expreſſion of their ſentiments, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, as far as poſſible, its ratification by our Supreme Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive." And whereas a publication has appeared in the New Jerſey State Gazette of laſt Tueſday,<note n="*" place="bottom">See page 127.</note> inſinuating to the world, that the ſaid reſolutions were not adopted at a general town-meeting; and teſtifying, that the ſubſcribers to the ſaid publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation "did not concur in, and did not approve of, the ſaid reſolutions; and declaring their entire ſatisfaction and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the conſtituted authorities, and their determination to acquieſce in ſuch meaſures as have been, or might be finally adopted, relative to the ſaid treaty, by ſuch conſtituted autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities," thereby caſting a neceſſary implication, that thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who attended the ſaid town-meeting, and concurred in the ſaid reſolutions, would not ſubmit to ſuch meaſures of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as might be finally adopted, with regard to the ſaid treaty.</p>
                  <p>NOW, WE, the ſubſcribers, citizens of Trenton and its vicinity, while we lament that, on an occaſion of this nature, means ſhould have been taken to prevail on unguarded indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals to unite in that public teſtimonial, contrary to their
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:028389_0209_0FD8E8E617732C80"/>known ſentiments—DO, in this public manner, declare and make known to the world, that we conceive it to be a right eſtabliſhed and confirmed to us by the conſtitution, peaceably to aſſemble together and make a public expreſſion of our ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on all public meaſures; a right which ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhed by freemen, only with their lives. And, WE DO ALSO thus publicly teſtify and declare our concurrence in, and entire approbation of the ſaid reſolutions of the general town meeting of the citizens of Trenton and its vicinity, herein before ſtated, with regard to the pending treaty: But while we are making this public declaration of our ſentiments, as well with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>That the preſident, though neither unerring in his judgment nor omnipotent in his execution; for his firmneſs, virtue, and wiſdom, which calculate him for the meridian of a republic— deſerves our eſteem, regard, and warmeſt applauſes; and whilſt we diſdain to adore him as a Deity, with equal reluctance would we with-hold his tribute, and wiſh to canonize him as the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his country.</p>
                  <p>That, It is the firm and unbiaſſed opinion of this aſſembly, that the preſident never has, by mal-adminiſtration, or miſrule in government, incurred a forfeiture of the eſteem and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his fellow citizens; but, on the contrary, that his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic and private life are both ſuperior to ſtricture.</p>
                  <p>That, It is the ſenſe of this meeting, that the character of the preſident, cannot be aided by eulogies, but only requires for its ſupport, inveſtigation.</p>
                  <p>On a motion being made and ſeconded,</p>
                  <p>Reſolved, That the proceedings of this day be publiſhed.</p>

                  <p>BEFORE the notary in the juriſdiction of Jeremie, there dwelling in the pariſh of St. Louis, iſland of St. Domingo, in the Weſt Indies, under-written in preſence of the witneſſes hereafter named, who have ſigned the ſame—</p>
                  <p>Was preſent in perſon, Mr. Samuel Oſhorne, captain of the ſloop Friendſhip, of New York, at anchor in this road this fortnight, and on his departure and return; aſſiſted by Mr. Thomas Praderes, interpreter of the Engliſh language in this

                  <p>That, at half paſt two o'clock in the afternoon of this day, the boat of the ſhip Regulus, at anchor this morning in this road, came on board of his veſſel, commanded by an officer of the ſaid ſhip, and took out of the ſaid veſſel the following men;

                  <p>I DID expect to have the pleaſure of ſeeing you on board the Africa; but as that is not the caſe, I am obliged to ſend an officer to you, under the preſent circumſtances, and to deſire that you will lay my letter before the governor, or other chief magiſtrate of the iſland, which is to contain theſe ſeveral requeſts:—</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that there may be delivered up to me, immediately, an officer who was taken on board a Britiſh ſloop, while in New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and conſined on board the French frigate now in Rhode Iſland; theſe violent proceedings being contrary to the law of all nations in a neutral port.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place, that you may receive the aid of the civil power in this iſland, to ſend on board the Africa all Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh

                  <p>That I may be permitted to buy ſuch refreſhments as my ſhip's company are in need of; and that in caſe I ſend my own boats on ſhore, my people and officers ſhall not be liable to in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>ts from any of the inhabitants, or others, of whatever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription; and to repreſent in plain terms to the governor, that <hi>if my officer who carries this letter, or any other officer or people whom I may ſend upon theſe juſt and lawful occaſions, receive from any one individual, whether of the nature of a mob or otherwiſe, any affront or inſult,</hi> I WILL IMMEDIATELY COME IN WITH HIS MAJESTY's SHIP UNDER MY COMMAND, AND PROTECT MY OWN PEOPLE: and further, that if the government or ſtates here, are, in ſuch caſes as I have mentioned, guilty of ſuch a breach of neutrality, I will then look upon myſelf in the ſame manner, as not bound to obſerve the neutrality of theſe ports; and <hi>I am reſolved to be treated in the ſame manner in all reſpects, whatever, as they do thoſe of the French Republic.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And I am the more plain in the nature of my preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, as I have received a hint, that if I ſend my people on ſhore, while the Meduſa lies at Newport, that they will be conſidered as ſpies.

                     <p>THE article relative to the trade of India, is in itſelf of too little moment to require much of our attention. The fact, with reſpect to that trade, is, that as the merchandizes carried to India conſiſt of commodities which the European nations cannot conveniently ſupply, together with money and neceſſaries for refitting their ſhips: As the proceeds of theſe cargoes are employed in purchaſing India goods from the fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the European nation at whoſe port we trade, there is a clear proſit in admitting us freely to their ports, and thereby rendering ſuch ports the entrepots between the United States and India. Should one nation only do this, and the others ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude us, the one that admitted our veſſels, would thereby ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a double proſit; firſt, upon the India goods ſold to us; ſecond, upon the ſale of the commodities we brought them. This is ſo well underſtood by all the European nations that have eſtabliſhments in India, that our veſſels are freely admitted into their ports (a very few excepted, that have a monopoly of a particular commodity) and France has put our trade with hers upon the moſt favorable footing. The reſtrictions in the treaty have thus <hi>narrowed,</hi> inſtead of <hi>enlarging,</hi> our advantages in trading to the Britiſh factories; but as all the others are open to us, ſhe will be compelled to receive us or loſe our commerce; and as her ports afford no peculiar advantage, neither the one nor the other merits our attention: the article, as far as it goes, is not good; but one can hardly call it bad, when connected with the reſt of the treaty; the deficiency of grace in a ſingle feature does not attract our notice, when the whole face is ſtrikingly deformed.</p>
                     <p>I proceed now to examine the effect of the treaty upon the commerce of this country when Britain ſhall be at war. It will be admitted, that the nature of our government, and our ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, remote from the polities and intereſts of ambitious pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in Europe, will enable us for the moſt part to live in peace. It will alſo be admitted, that a maritime nation that cultivates peace, may add greatly to her commerce and navigation, if
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:028389_0219_0FD8E901D59511F8"/>ſhe can carry on her trade with the belligerent powers, while theirs is diminiſhed by the conflict. In order to do this, it is eſſentially neceſſary, that ſhe ſhould be able to make the powers at war reſpect her flag, and the rights of neutrality.</p>
                     <p>With this view, therefore, commercial nations have always endeavored by treaty, to protect their commerce from the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions which the principles of the old law of nations (now indeed ſufficiently exploded) afforded either of the belligerent powers a pretence to interpoſe. In looking back thro' the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which the nations of Europe have for one hundred and fifty years paſt formed, with a view to this object, we find principles laid down and eſtabliſhed by them, in theſe reſpects totally different from the rules which the writers on the law of nations, borrowing their maxims from barbarous ages, have recorded. For it ſhould be remembered, that the law of nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is no written code, but a collection of thoſe principles which govern the conduct of civilized nations, with reſpect to each other; which principles can only be collected from their practice, and the theory eſtabliſhed by their treaties: and as the laws of a community are calculated to promote the intereſt of the members of that community, and are repealed or go into diſuſe when they are found not to anſwer this purpoſe, ſo the laws of nations alſo change with their refinements and civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lization. If, therefore, a man were to look into the laws of any ancient ſtate, he would find many things that would appear to him abſurd, and contrary to humanity, which ſtill main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their place in the ſtatute book. Thus in England, be would find the trial by Battle Laws againſt Witchcraft, and a variety of ridiculous local cuſtoms, which would greatly ſhoc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> his feelings, until he was told that all this traſh had gone into diſuſe, though the laws were never formally repealed.</p>
                     <p>So, in looking into the writings upon the laws of nations, be would find attempts upon the common rights of humanity, upon the independence of neutral nations, juſtified by the max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims of writers, who, for the moſt part, are pedants that reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence antiquity, and make no allowance for the change that the increaſed commerce and intercourſe of nations have occaſioned. Thus Vattel, to juſtify the capture of veſſels going to a blockaded port, tells us, that Demetrius, about two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years ago, hung the pilot and mariners of a veſſel that carried proviſions to Athens, which he had blockaded. The writers on the laws of nations in Algiers, could juſtify their practice by more recent and valid precedents But when we look into the practice of nations, we find that their ſentiments, expreſſed in all their treaties, for a ſeries of years, have refuted

To ſtrengthen thoſe laws, is peculiarly the duty and intereſt of a nation, that will probably be ſeldom engaged in a war, and always deeply intereſted in the freedom of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence and navigation. As far back, therefore, as the year 1630, and ever ſince, I find the commercial nations declaring by treaty, what ſhall be conſidered as contraband, and limiting this ſtrictly to arms and ammunition, and inſtruments of war, actually made up for that purpoſe; ſtipulating that free ſhips ſhall make free goods—declaring that full credit ſhall be given is ſhip's papers; that armed veſſels ſhall not come within can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non ſhot of a neutral ſhip, but ſend their boat on board, with only three men at moſt, to examine papers, but not ſearch.— In ſhort, the treaties for one hundred and forty years back, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to this object, are drawn in the <hi>very words</hi> of the treaty between the United States and France; as they are again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated in the late treaty between England and France. For this ſtriking ſimilarity I refer to the treaty between Spain and the United Provinces, in 1650, and to a long ſeries of conventions between various nations ſince; in which I can ſafely declare, I have not yet, after the moſt diligent ſearch, found a ſingle treaty in which the ſame latitude is given to the word <hi>contraband,</hi> as Mr. Jay has given it in his treaty with Lord Grenville: no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> have I met with one, though ſuch poſſibly may exiſt, in which as proviſion is made to guard the neutral ſhip from ſearch and ſpoliation.</p>
                     <p>The twenty-ſecond article of the treaty between Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and France, confines the word, contraband, to arms, ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and military ſtores; and the twenty-third article expreſsly excludes cordage, ſails, tar, roſin, pitch, maſts for ſhips, plank, timber of all hinds, and all other things proper for either building or repairing ſhips.</p>
                     <p>The ſame principles are followed in our treaty with France, Holland and Sweden, and the ſame, as I have ſtated, are to be found in treaties near one hundred and fifty years back; ſo that notwithſtanding a looſe expreſſion in Vattel, velative to naval ſtores, we may conſider it as now ſettled by the uniform ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of nations, as expreſſed in their treaties, that contraband muſt, in its nature, be confined to arms and military ſtores. But were it otherwiſe, as the object of every treaty is to gain ſome advantage which you did not before enjoy by the laws of nations, or to remove ſome doubt which might be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained on thoſe laws; no nation ever enters into a treaty in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to enforce an eſtabliſhed law, unleſs that law is beneficial to it. What then could Mr. Jay's inducement be, after we had
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:028389_0221_0FD8E9076EC55F98"/>obtained from France, Holland and Sweden, expreſs ſtipulations exempting naval ſtores, &amp;c. from the liſt of contraband—After three great nations of Europe had, by their treaties, and by their formal acceſſion to the principles of the armed neutrality, declared that theſe articles were <hi>not</hi> contraband—after Britain had at length made the ſame recognition by her treaty with France—after the preſident of the United States had expreſsly, in his proclamation, referred to the <hi>modern law</hi> of nations for the meaning of the word contraband, and in his enumeration of contraband articles, had excepted all thoſe that are excepted in our treaty with France—I ſay, what could be Mr. Jay's inducement to declare, in the 18th article of his treaty, the following ſtaple commodities of this country contraband— "Alſo timber for ſhip-building, tar or roſin, copper in ſheets, ſails, hemp, and cordage, <hi>and generally whatever may ſerve di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly for the equipment of veſſels, unwrought iron and fir pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Was it probable that the United States would ſoon be at war with any nation, to whom Britain would carry theſe commodities? Was not Britain already at war with a nation who furniſhes us a good market for them?

                     <p>IT has been uſual in treaties, to confine every diſtinct mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to a ſeparate article: thus the 22d article of the treaty between France and Britain, declares what is contraband; the 23d article expreſsly ſpecifies the exceptions. But Lord Gren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville's treaty, as if with a view to render the ſubject as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure as poſſible, crouds a variety of diſtinct matter into the ſame article, which makes it much more difficult to reaſon on the ſubject, unleſs the reader will be at the trouble of turning to the article at the time that he hears the commentary upon it. The article before us contains three diſtinct matters; firſt, it enumerates contraband, without excepting any one article ſhipped from the United States, other than unwrought iron and <hi>fir plank;</hi> as is uſually done in ſimilar caſes, and which would have been peculiarly proper in the preſent caſe, becauſe of the ſweeping words, "and generally whatever may ſerve di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the equipment of veſſels;"—words of ſuch extent as to include a very conſiderable portion of our exports, which by this article, are to be forfeited.</p>

But, ſays the treaty "it is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult preciſely to determine the caſes." Why ſo, ſir? Are the caſes ſo very numerous, or are they ſo doubtful? If both, or either, they called for the more care and accuracy in the enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:028389_0224_0FD8E9155B0CAAD8"/>and definition. Are they not ultimately to be decided ſome where? Or is the difficulty of deciding, to juſtify the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of every American veſſel loaded with proviſions, or any other article; for the articles which are to become contraband, are as undefined as the occaſion which makes them ſuch? I again aſk, ſir, by what rule is this queſtion, ſo important to our commerce, to be decided? You ſay, by the law of nations! but where is this law to be found? The writers on the law of nations, like the writers on every other law, differ from each other; but if the caſes are preciſely laid down, why not ſtate them? Was the chief juſtice of the United States leſs capable of doing this than the captain of a Providence privateer? Theſe caſes could either be defined with preciſion, or they could not: in the firſt caſe, they ſhould have been ſtated; in the laſt they ſhould not have been affirmed by the ſignature of our envoy. But when an American veſſel is brought into a Britiſh port, the maritime judge muſt do what the chief juſtice of the United States and Lord Grenville could not do; he muſt determine, whether her cargo, conſiſting of proviſions and other articles, is or is not within the caſe in which they may become contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. Now, let me aſk, ſir, whether, after what we have ſeen of their deciſions, it was prudent to leave the whole commerce of theſe United States to their mercy, by giving them an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited power to judge, in caſes of ſo much intricacy, that you yourſelf could not agree upon them? Do you reflect, ſir, that you have, by this very article, authorized them, even if, contrary to their uſual practice, they conform to the law of nations, to condemn every veſſel going to any port of France, or their colonies, with proviſions, or returning from their iſlands to any port in Europe, loaded with the produce of thoſe iſlands, and that they derive this right from the very words of your treaty? The rule of the law of nations, as laid down by Vattel, and which is alſo a rule of the civil law, is thus: "that if he who can and ſhould explain himſelf clearly and fully, neglects to do it, ſo much the worſe for himſelf; he ſhall not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted afterwards to make reſtrictions, which he has not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed." Now, the court of Great Britain has officially told us, that ſhe has a right by the law of nations, under the peculiar circumſtances of France, to interdict all trade in proviſions with her or her iſlands; as alſo to prevent any part of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of her colonies from being carried in neutral veſſels to any port in Europe; the clamours excited by neutral powers, and the apprehenſion of drawing upon herſelf new enemies, made her ſuſpend <hi>ſome</hi> of theſe conſtructions: but with reſpect to <hi>us,</hi> as appears from Mr. Pinckney's and Mr. Hammond's
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:028389_0225_0FD8E91868FB6CB0"/>letters, ſhe ſtill keeps up the right, as ſhe ſays, under the law of nations. Her courts, conforming to this ſentiment, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Theſe obſervations apply with equal force to the third mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of this article: For as the Britiſh claimed a right to declare a whole nation at a time in a ſtate of ſiege, even <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> condemned, without defining, or in any part limiting the words, blockade and ſiege, do we not tacitly agree to their conſtruction of the term? Repugnant as this definition is to the eſtabliſhed and known laws of nations, it is very remarkable, that where the moſt rigid conſtruction of the laws of nations can be made to operate againſt us, in order to preſerve them in full forts, and in contradiction of the ſettled practice of modern times, Mr. Jay has added to theſe laws, the weight of a national ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation againſt his conſtituents—but where the writers on natural law advance a principle, beneficial to us, Mr. Grenville's treaty cautiouſly avoids putting it out of doubt, or giving it any addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional force. Thus Vattel declares, "That it is now received, that full faith and credit ſhould be given to certificates and ſea
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:028389_0226_0FD8E919D164F508"/>letters, &amp;c. that the maſter of the ſhip preſents, unleſs a fraud appears, or there be good reaſon of ſuſpicion."—Lib. III. chap. vii. (114)—and in every treaty of commerce, and navigation, that has been made, for upwards of one hundred years back, this principle is enlarged upon, and violences in boarding a ſhip, to examine her papers, guarded againſt by fixing that the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>med ſhip ſhall remain at a diſtance, that the neutral veſſels ſhall be boarded by two or three men only, that full faith ſhall be given to papers, &amp;c. Yet not one word of this is to be found in Mr. Jay's treaty, except a mere vague agreement, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party ſhall injure the other in their perſons or eſtate, and ſhall make good all damages and be puniſhed for outrages, without defining what theſe outrages are, or fixing a line, which it ſhould always be an outrage to paſs.</p>
                     <p>That the Britiſh idea of outrage differed from ours, we know; for Mr. Jay himſelf poſſeſſed the fulleſt evidence of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages committed by captains of men of war and privateers, in plundering our veſſels, and preſſing and ill-treating our ſeamen; yet we hear of no officer that has loſt his ſhip or commiſſion on this account: and as to private ſuits, every man knows, that the expenſe and diſtance will prevent their being brought. With all the treaties hitherto entered into by the United States before him, as well as all other treaties made for a ſeries of years paſt, which are accurate on this point, could Mr. Jay be ignorant of the common practice of nations? Was he ignorant, that the abuſes we daily ſuffered at ſea, in the boarding our ſhips, with numerous bodies of armed men, in the contempt manifeſted for our papers, in breaking up the hatches, and endangering the ſhip, were among the cauſes of complaint that the preſident ſent him to prefer? If he was not, why are not theſe evils guarded againſt by an expreſs ſtipulation, that faith ſhall be given to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, that no ſhip ſhall be ſearched or detained, where her papers are fair, and ſhe does not refuſe to ſhow them! why are not privateers ordered to remain without gun ſhot (as in our treaty with France, and the treaty of France with Britain, &amp;c.) while no more than two, or at moſt three hands are admitted on board the neutral ſhip? Why are vague and general terms ſubſtituted for theſe wholeſome proviſions, unleſs it be with deſign to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject our commerce to unceaſing inſults?</p>
                     <p>The ſame abandonment of our navigation runs through every commercial article. By the ſeventeenth, the Britiſh are empow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered (contrary to the principles of the armed neutrality, which have evidently changed the law of nations, by the general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the great community of civilized nations, and to which Britain herſelf has in effect acceded, in this particular, by her
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:028389_0227_0FD8E91FCC15A4A8"/>late treaty with France) to take enemies' property from on board our veſſels. One would have imagined, even if the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had been clearly againſt us, that mere delicacy, with reſpect to the nations with whom we have treaties, by which we can protect the property of their enemies from them, would have induced us to refrain from a ſtipulation, by which we volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſacrificed their property under the protection of our flag <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>IT may not be improper now to review our commerce, as it would ſtand, were the treaty carried into effect. The Indian trade from Canada, alone, produced at public ſales in London, in 1784, £. 230, 000 ſterling. The duties thereon were in round numbers, £. 17, 000. The tonnage of furs and peltry, about 1000 tons. The exports from Canada in furs, exceeded in 1785, that of the preceding year, about £. 70, 000 ſterling, and has, I believe, continued to increaſe; ſo that this branch of trade may be fairly eſtimated at near 100, 000 dollars yearly. As nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenths of the Indian nations, who carry on this trade (if the territories of the Hudſon Bay company are excepted) live within the boundaries of the ſtates, as we enjoyed every advantage in the right to the poſts and poſtages, the greateſt part of this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable trade muſt have been ours, had not Mr. Jay thought proper to <hi>cede it,</hi> in effect, to the Britiſh, as I have before ſtated. The Indian trade, in the ſourthern part of our territories, is principally in peltries, which are too bulky to be tranſported in any other way than upon large rivers; the Miſſiſſippi will be the out-let for a very great proportion of them. This commerce muſt have been excluſively ours; for though, by the treaty of Paris, the Britiſh might navigate the Miſſiſſippi; yet, as they did not own a foot of land upon either of its banks, it became im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them to avail themſelves of this advantage; whereas the United States poſſeſſing all the Indian country, in the vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of that river, and the eaſt bank for many hundred miles, could, when they pleaſed, eſtabliſh factories, and monopolize that commerce; and in addition to this, carry on a very import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant (though illicit) trade with the Spaniards, who own the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite bank. This our miniſter extraordinary was too munificent to allow us to avail ourſelves of. He therefore provides, in the third article, "that all the ports and places, on its eaſtern ſide, to whichſoever of the parties belonging, be freely reſorted to and uſed by both parties, in as ample a manner as any of the Atlantic ports or places, &amp;c." then comes a clauſe declaring, "that all goods and merchandizes, whoſe importation into the United States is not wholly prohibited, may freely, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of commerce, be carried into the ſame, in the manner aforeſaid, by his majeſty's ſubjects; and ſuch goods and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes ſhall be ſubject to no other or higher duties than would be payable by the citizens of the United States on the importation of the ſame in American veſſels, in the Atlantic ports of the ſaid ſtates." I have already ſhown, that the effect of this laſt proviſion is to give Britiſh ſhips a bounty proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:028389_0229_0FD8E92161C3F390"/>to the amount of the equalizing duty on the out and house voyage, taken together, to the prejudice of American veſſels; which, with the perfect equality of rights, that they hold i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>So that, after all, were our other branches of commerce leſt unfettered, we ſhould be able to do without that of the Britiſh iſlands, which only amounts to about one-eighth of the whole Weſt India trade. And ſuch is the dependence of thoſe iſlands upon us, that they muſt either ſtarve or be ſupplied by us upon our terms. As this was too obvious to eſcape the attention of Lord Grenville, and our miniſter, they have provided, 1. That we ſhall impoſe no new duties on tonnage; that is, in other words, that, treat us as ſhe will, Britain ſhall ſtill have the
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:028389_0230_0FD8E922EA9E2BE8"/>right to carry our produce to her iſlands in her own veſſels, to the excluſion of ours. 2. That ſhe ſhall alſo, if ſhe pleaſes, prevent our carrying our produce to the French or Dutch iſlands, or their produce to Europe, at leaſt during a war, which has been, for one hundred years back, thirty years out of ſeventy; ſince ſhe has nothing to do but to declare them in a ſtate of ſiege, or to allege that the articles are contraband, or that this is one of the caſes in which they may become con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traband, though not generally ſo; and ſhe will then be juſtified, by the treaty, in carrying them into her own ports, where ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men may be preſſed on board their ſhips of war, ſeduced to ſwear that the cargo is enemies' property, and thus the whole be confiſcated; or if this great evil ſhould be avoided, compel the owner to pay his own expenſes, and to take whatever the captor ſhall deem a reaſonable profit, without any regard to the loſs he ſuſtains, in the breaking up his voyage, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>In peace, France will, with juſtice, avail herſelf of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle which entitles her to put her trade upon the ſame footing as that of the moſt favored nation, become her own carrier, and baniſh our veſſels from her iſlands, as we have permitted the Britiſh to exclude us from theirs. Europe, perhaps, will be more favorable to us. But here again we have, by the equaliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duty, and the extra-tonnage and light money, rendered it impoſſible to carry our commodities to Britain in our own veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; while we, at the ſame time, bind ourſelves not to give ſuch advantages to other nations as would open new markets for them. Britain then muſt continue to navigate; for no other merchants muſt monopolize our commerce; her officers muſt ſtrut upon our exchanges with all the "dignity due to their commiſſions;" her high commiſſioned courts may drag us from one end of the continent to the other; muſt eſtabliſh new rules of juriſprudence; and you, my unhappy fellow citizens, muſt be content with the humble offices of hewers of wood and drawers of water, to theſe inſolent iſlanders.</p>
                     <p>During the war, the conceſſions relative to contraband amount to an abſolute prohibition of any trade in naval ſtores, timber, proviſions, and any other article, which the Britiſh pleaſe to call contraband, under exiſting circumſtances, either with France or Holland.</p>

Can we expect, that they will ſuffer their treaties to entangle them, and extend protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to their enemies? It is not to be expected; they will be compelled, by neceſſity, to treat us, as we have <hi>agreed</hi> that the Britiſh ſhall treat us; in which caſe, as Britain will not let us trade with France or Holland, France and Holland will inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict our commerce with Britain, Spain, and Portugal; and thus the trade and navigation of this country be finally deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the means that were intended for its protection.</p>
                     <p>How different has Mr. Jay's conduct been from Mr. Pinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney's! Read his letters to Lord Grenville. He maintained our right to protect neutral property; he proteſted with firmneſs againſt the abſurd idea of naval ſtores and proviſions being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traband; he ſaw the wide difference between admitting a thing to be <hi>right,</hi> and yielding to the <hi>neceſſities</hi> of the moment, which
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:028389_0232_0FD8E92EA55FE2E8"/>circumſtances might hereafter enable us to contend againſt with ſucceſs. Indeed it may be doubted whether the right given by treaty to take enemies' property out of our veſſels, is not a "privilege or immunity" granted to the commerce and naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Great Britain; in which caſe, by the third article of our treaty with France, they have alſo a right to claim it; which eſtabliſhes an important diſtinction between <hi>ſuffering</hi> this from neceſſity, and granting it by treaty.</p>
                     <p>The ill effect which this treaty muſt have upon our national character, exceeds all calculation. A young nation, like a young man, is bound to be particularly ſolicitous on this head; nor can any thing be more repugnant to the intereſt and honor of the country, than the ſhocking indifference that our miniſterial writers and their newſpapers endeavour to inculcate on this head. Thus they ſay, "We are growing rich in ſpite of all theſe injuries; let us mind our buſineſs—let us ſubmit. We ſhall hereafter be ſtrong, when we may bluſter at our leiſure." What ſhould we think of the tutor that ſhould inculcate on a young man the ſame maxims? "Suffer yourſelf to be kicked and cuffed now, while you are young; let your ſiſter be raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and your wife be debauched, by the letcher who permits you to get money. What though he inſiſts upon ſharing a part of it with you, and now and then lays his cudgel over your head? Submit now to ſmile upon him; by and by you will be as ſtrong as he is, and then you may bully him in turn."— What, I ſay, ſhould we think of ſuch a tutor, but that he was a villain and a ſcoundrel, who was leading his pupil through the dread of preſent evil to debaſe his character, and to invite infinitely greater evils in future, than thoſe he feared to meet at preſent.

                     <p>IN my former numbers, I endeavoured, 1ſt, To ſhew that the object of Mr. Jay's miſſion, ſo far as related to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for the injuries received, and ſecurity againſt future aggreſſion, was not accompliſhed. While I was yet writing, the renewal of them proved, beyond contradiction, that my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks were well founded, and that the Britiſh conſtruction of the treaty was unhappily too ſimilar to my own; ſince they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waited to give ſufficient time for its ratification, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, with added violence, their depredations on our trade, and their outrages againſt our citizen ſeamen. I then examined the treaty in a mere commercial light, without indulging my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in thoſe general reflections which aroſe naturally from the articles under conſideration. I proceed now to conſider it in a political point of view—Would to God, my fellow citizens, I could here find ſome ſource of conſolation, ſome ray of light, to irradiate the ſullen gloom!—But alas! every ſtep we take, plunges us into thicker darkneſs. We might, perhaps, have ſubmitted to paſt loſſes; have ſeen our commerce given away without an equivalent; our navigation ruined; our ſeamen (I bluſh with ſhame and indignation, while I ſay it) our citizen ſeamen delivered over to the inſolence of brutal tyrants, could our national honor have been preſerved in future—could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                        </gap> paired—could peace have been eſtabliſhed upon firm and honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able terms—could the private rights of our citizens, the public ones of our government, have remained unviolated—but the indiſcriminate ruin of all theſe is too much to be borne in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Even the coward-advocates for peace, feel their ſpirits ariſe at the unexampled indignities which this treaty impoſes. And for what? Are we nearer peace (if by peace is meant the ſecurity of our perſons and property, from foreign depredations) than when Mr. Jay left this country? Is there a ſingle outrage which we ſuffered before, which is not continued to this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? And yet the advocates for the treaty are continually ringing in our ears, the bleſſings of peace, the horrors of war; and they have the effrontery to aſſure us, that we enjoy the firſt and have eſcaped the laſt, merely (to borrow a miniſterial term) through the inſtrumentality of the treaty. Does any body believe, that if we had continued to ſuffer the Britiſh to plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our trade, to man their ſhips with our ſeamen, to poſſeſs our frontiers in quiet, the they would have declared war upon
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:028389_0234_0FD8E93613AEE508"/>us, at leaſt till they had conquered France? And can any man deny, that it would have been better to have preſerved this dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but baſe-born bantling, which excites our bluſhings while we fondle it, by mere ſubmiſſion, than to legitimate the baſtard, and compel ourſelves for ever to maintain it upon the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful terms, by marrying its lewd mother? In a political view, the treaty is bad; as it detaches us from engagements which our intereſt and honor equally invite us to maintain: as it ſacrifices our friends to our enemies, and holds forth to the world, that thoſe nations who treat us worſt, will ſhare the greateſt portion of our attachment; and that, like fawning ſpaniels, we can be beaten into love and ſubmiſſion, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the corrupt maxims that were circulated under the ſignature of Pacificus, with a view to promote the league of deſpots againſt France.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding the indecent attempts that were made about the ſame time, by ſeveral members of congreſs, to ſhew that we owed her no affection, the principles of gratitude have ſtill maintained their ground in this country; and they have been ſtrengthened by the neceſſity which every American felt, of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing ſome ally againſt the deſign which Britain almoſt open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly avowed, of again reducing this country, when her means, ſtrengthened by the intereſt ſhe had in our councils and in our commercial cities, ſhould afford her a proſpect of attempting it with ſucceſs. It is ſingular to obſerve the extreme ſolicitude with which a party, among us, have endeavoured to detach the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of this country from the only nation with whom its true intereſt would prompt it to form a cloſe and ſtrict alliance, not only becauſe its government is ſimilar to our own, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its commerce is more advantageous to us than that of any other nation in the world; while its manufactures are ſuch as can ſupply the greateſt part of our wants, its demands for our produce are ſo much larger than that of any other nation, that ſhe actually pays us a conſiderable proportion of that ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance in money which we are compelled to remit to Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain on the loſing commerce which we carry on with her. It will be remembered here, that near two millions of our former exports to England, were conſumed in France, and as much more in other countries. It will be remembered, too, ſhe gives the higheſt encouragement to our navigation, while her inſular rival uſes every means to depreſs it. Yet whenever any attempt has been made to encourage this commerce or ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en this alliance, the moſt violent clamours have been excited by the Britiſh faction, aided by our own royaliſts, and the ſlighteſt incidents have been ſeized with avidity to render her
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:028389_0235_0FD8E93B8FEB7850"/>obnoxious. Thus the imprudent warmth of Mr. G—t called forth all the zeal of the party; miniſters, chief juſtices, ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, &amp;c. joined in full cry, to run down the French nation, under the appearance of regard for the honor of their own, while they were ſo totally regardleſs of its intereſts as to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look the offers that he brought, of ſuch commercial advantages as might have made us ſee with contempt, the narrow policy of the Britiſh government in excluding us from their iſlands, which the liberality of France muſt have compelled her to open to us on our own terms.</p>
                     <p>And yet theſe very men have heard with the utmoſt indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the inſulting ſpeech of Lord Dorcheſter—the inſolent cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence of H—d, which went, both in matter and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, far beyond any thing written by G—t; and while they diſcouraged a connection with France, founded upon mutual advantages, they meanly ſupplicate Britain to treat with us upon her own terms, and contrive that this treaty ſhould ſerve the double purpoſe of connecting us with her, and detaching us from France. At the ſame time, they have the effrontery to aſſert, that the treaty contains no article which can reaſonably give umbrage to France, or which in any way derogates from the friendſhip that ſhould ſubſiſt between the two nations. I ſhall proceed briefly to conſider the truth of this aſſertion.</p>
                     <p>In the enumeration of contraband, Mr. Jay has included ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles which are eſſential to France, and which have not been conſidered, as far as I have been able to diſcover, as contraband in any treaty for 140 years paſt. In admitting that proviſions may be contraband in any caſe (except when going to a place blockaded) Mr. Jay has alſo admitted, what no treaty ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did, though tyrants have ſometimes claimed a right to ſtop them. The United States had evidently no intereſt in either of theſe articles; of courſe they could not be reciprocal, nor is any equivalent offered for them. France and Britain were at war: <hi>theſe articles were protected in going to the latter by our treaty with France; ſo that in admitting them to be contraband, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> neceſſarily confine the ſale of them to Great Britain, and exclude France from availing herſelf of our commerce in theſe articles, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs at the utmoſt riſque and expenſe;</hi> we make their generoſity in excepting them from the liſt of contraband (if they really were ſuch by the law of nations) afford the means of furniſhing them to their enemy: for if our treaty with France and Britain were ſimilar in this reſpect, the riſque and expenſe would have been equal in going to either country; and both would have obtained theſe commodities upon pretty much the ſame terms. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, then, that theſe articles could only have been diclated by
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:028389_0236_0FD8E93D0A468228"/>a ſpirit hoſtile to France, and as ſuch they are a direct breach of our neutrality.</p>
                     <p>Vattel, in enumerating the caſes in which a neutral na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may carry on a commerce with the belligerent powers, has theſe words, which directly apply to the caſe before us: "If they (the neutral nation) refuſe to ſell me any article, and take meaſures to ſupply my enemy with it in abundance, with a view to favor them, this partially is a breach of the neutrality." Whatever has been ſaid with reſpect to the above article, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies with equal force to the right that the treaty gives to Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to confiſcate the property of their enemy found on board our veſſels, contrary to the modern law of nations, and their own admiſſion of its principles in their treaty with France. But if any thing was wanting to ſhow the hoſtility of theſe articles, it could be found in the time we had pitched upon to enter into them, and that we had ſtipulated for their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. 1ſt, as I have ſaid, France was actually at war. 2d, By the 12th article it is agreed that theſe proviſions ſhall continue in force during the preſent war, and for two years after, when the parties "will renew their diſcuſſions, and endeavor to agree, whether in any, and what caſes, neutral veſſels ſhall protect enemies' property; and in what caſes proviſions, and other arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, not generally contraband, may become ſuch."</p>
                     <p>From this it is evident, that theſe were queſtions of doubt in the minds of the contracting parties; they were ſpeculative queſtions, as capable of ſolution in the preſent moment, as at any future period; the diſcuſſion of them could have no refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to a war between powers with whom we were at peace; the declaring, therefore, that this doubt ſhould be conſtrued as unfavorably as poſſible to France, and directly in favor of the Britiſh, even to the partial injury of our own commerce, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>apparent</hi> equivalent, and that, too, <hi>during the war,</hi> how long ſoever it may laſt, is ſo unequivocal a proof of hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that it is impoſſible to miſtake the intention of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting parties, which, reduced to plain language, is this: "theſe articles may be inconvenient in future; but as the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of them will be very injurious to France, whoſe reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we both wiſh, we agree that his Britannic majeſty ſhall have the full benefit of them, <hi>for the preſent;</hi> and when, by this operation, he ſhall have reduced France to ſubmiſſion, we will agree to modify them, ſo as to render them conformable to our intereſts." Injurious as theſe articles are to our commerce, the baſeneſs and perfidy of them are ſo much more ſo to our national character, that the firſt of theſe conſiderations is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt loſt in our reſentment of the laſt. By the 24th article it
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:028389_0237_0FD8E943A5816120"/>is expreſsly ſtipulated, that no power at war with Britain ſhall ſell their prizes in our harbours.</p>
                     <p>Now by the law of nations, independent of treaties, any nation may carry her prize to a neutral port, and ſell it, Vat. 3 lib. ch. vii. 132; and accordingly, France has hitherto been permitted, without any expreſs ſtipulation in her treaty, ſo to do. To withdraw this right, <hi>now,</hi> in the midſt of a war, though not expreſsly againſt the law of nations, has certainly a moſt ungracious and unfriendly appearance; eſpecially as it is done without our being able to apologize for it by any intereſt that we can have, at leaſt during this war, in the ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation. As it was foreſeen, at the time that the treaty was entered into, that Holland muſt be conquered, and that ſhe would make an ally of France; the 25th article, which admits the Britiſh to bring their prizes into our ports, and forbids the armed veſſels of any other nation (France excepted) to enter them, unleſs forced by ſtreſs of weather, &amp;c. and which agrees that we ſhall not in future, let any other nation ſhare this favor, is certainly no evidence of a friendly attachment either to France or Holland; and yet theſe powers were our friends and allies, when Britain was our bittereſt foe. I forbear to remark upon the ſtipulations we have made in favor of the navigation of Britain, as ſpeaking the ſame unfriendly language; ſince this is a leſs aggreſſion and will undoubtedly be returned upon us by other nations; ſo that the whole loſs will ultimately <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The liberality which France manifeſted to us in our diſtreſs— the ſuccour ſhe afforded us—and the unexampled generoſity ſhe manifeſted in taking no advantage of our ſituation, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe unjuſt or hard conditions upon us, certainly ſhould have rendered us cautions of favoring a nation, that has wantonly, and without the ſlighteſt provocation, declared herſelf her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and uſed the moſt barbarous and unjuſtifiable means to diſtreſs her. We ſhould have ſhuddered at being parties to a compact, to ſtarve 26 millions of our fellow creatures—at the thought of aiding Britain in her endeavours to repeat in Europe the horrid barbarities ſhe had committed in India. We ſhould, even if we had no obligations to France, and been blind to our own intereſt, we ſhould ſtill, for the ſake of humanity, have reſiſted a treaty, which admitted, that the neceſſaries of life could, in any caſe, be juſtly withheld from a famiſhed nation. But if all theſe motives had no weight with us, we ſhould have reflected on the forbearance, the delicate regard that France has ſhown to our circumſtances, even in the midſt of her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs. By our treaty we have guaranteed her iſlands to her;
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:028389_0238_0FD8E9448BC99FB8"/>theſe iſlands are attacked; ſhe is entitled to the benefit of our guarantee.

                     <p>AS every neutral nation may, without forfeiting that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, ſuffer the belligerent powers to diſpoſe of prizes in their harbours—as the United States will generally be at peace, while Britain is engaged in wars, 30 years out of 70, very conſiderable advantages would reſult from this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.—During a general European war, the commodities of all nations would be ſold (as prize goods generally are) at a low rate, would ſupply our own wants, and be tranſported in our veſſels to every part of the globe, and the demand for commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities and mechanics, neceſſary to the fitting of veſſels, would add to our wealth and ſtimulate our induſtry.—To relinquiſh theſe advantages without an equivalent, is certainly very unwiſe, particularly when it is conſidered, that our ſituation in the neighbourhood of the colonies of all the maritime powers, muſt render the free admiſſion of ſome and the excluſion of their enemies, extremely important to them. We have, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, been very tenacious of this privilege, and denied it even to Holland, who may be conſidered as one of our earlieſt allies. Yet the 24th article of Mr. Jay's treaty expreſsly ſtipulates, that no foreign nation, at war with Britain, ſhall ſell her prizes in our harbours, excludes their armed veſſels, and ſtipulates that ſimilar privileges ſhall be granted to no other nations; and all this without any equivalent—For though the proviſion i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>mutual,</hi> yet the advantage is entirely on one ſide—1ſt, Becauſe Britain being our only natural enemy (by natural enemy is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood one whoſe intereſts claſh, either becauſe of the <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity of their territorries,</hi> or rivalry in their purſuits) it is highly improbable that we ſhall be engaged in any war in which ſhe is not a party againſt us. 2d, Becauſe our diſtance from Europe will prevent our being often engaged in thoſe controverſies which convulſe that quarter of the globe. 3d, Becauſe there is no
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:028389_0239_0FD8E9463ABE6038"/>naval war in which Britain is not a party; if we ſhould happen to be engaged on the ſame ſide with her, we ſhould mutually uſe each others ports without a treaty; if we ſhould be oppoſed to her, the treaty will ceaſe to operate; ſo that in every view, we have made a very important conceſſion in this particular, without having acquired any thing in return. The article is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely exceptionable in another point of view. The conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſo doubtful, that a ſimilar article gave birth all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy between our government and Mr. Genet. It would certainly have been prudent then to have varied the expreſſion, and ſteered clear of this ambiguity in treating with a nation who wreſts every poſſible doubt to her own advantage—and who finds chief juſtices and ſenators, and miniſters extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and advocates, among ourſelves, ready to ſupport her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, be they ever ſo abſurd.</p>
                     <p>By the 15th article, we are prohibited from impoſing any ſpecific duty on Britiſh articles, which we do not extend to all other nations, from increaſing our tonnage duty or impoſing any greater charge on the importation of goods in Britiſh bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms than <hi>now</hi> ſubſiſts. I have already ſhown the miſchievous effect of this article upon our <hi>navigation.</hi> I will now conſider it, as it regards our political relation with other nations.— Treaties are bargains, in which ſomething is given in return for ſome other received. Thoſe, then, that put it out of their power to <hi>give,</hi> cannot hope to <hi>receive.</hi> Suppoſe, for inſtance, we ſhould find it convenient, in order to procure a market for our fiſh and oil, to bargain with France for their free admiſſion into her ports, and promiſe in return to receive her manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of ſilk at a leſs duty than we impoſe upon the ſame arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles brought from elſewhere. This is the policy of Britain with reſpect to Portugal, whoſe wines ſhe favors in preference to thoſe of other nations, in return for advantages ſhe derives from her commerce.—This article puts ſuch a bargain entirely out of our power; yet ſuffers Britain to continue her reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon a variety of our commodities. While it remains in force, no treaty whatever in favor of our manufactures, navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, or commerce, can be entered into with other nations; thus, notwithſtanding we have not any equivalent from Britain, in return for this article, any relaxation of her oppreſſive ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of navigation, we bind our hands with reſpect to every other nation—and while ſhe cloſes one door upon us, promiſes to leave our commerce and navigation impriſoned without mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſmalleſt effort to open another.</p>
                     <p>The tenth article of the treaty partakes of the evils of the above, in the want of reciprocity, and in depriving us of the
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:028389_0240_0FD8E94A6D4727F0"/>means of doing ourſelves juſtice, without recurring to arms, when the laws of nations with reſpect to us are violated. By this article, neither the debts due to individuals, nor money in the funds, are to be <hi>ſequeſtered</hi> or confiſcated. Firſt, this is not mutual; becauſe it is well known that few Americans truſt their money in Britiſh funds, ſince the eſtabliſhment of our own. And a balance of about ten millions (excluſive of ſtock) is due from our citizens, on the general average, to the ſubjects Britain. By the law of nations, this property may be <hi>ſequeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered;</hi> though, in general, it has been <hi>the practice</hi> of late, ſince the commercial connections of nations have multiplied, not to <hi>forfeit it,</hi> and that, principally, becauſe the balances being mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually due, little advantage would accrue to the nation.</p>
                     <p>As to the juſtice or injuſtice, it never has been made a queſtion; the rule of nations is, "that the property, either private or public, of an enemy, may be taken," and I believe it would be difficult to ſhow, that it was more juſt to rob the merchant of his goods at ſea, becauſe his ſovereign was at war, than to forfeit his debts; both being equally the property of an enemy, both tending equally to diſtreſs the individual, and neither being a violation of a private contract, becauſe the nation who makes the forfeiture is no party to ſuch contract. If the rights of humanity are conſidered, a capture at ſea is a much greater breach of them, ſince it is frequently attended with the loſs of life, and always with the loſs of liberty. The ſtigma, therefore, that our miniſter was pleaſed to introduce into the treaty on this ſubject, could only have been intended as an illiberal reflection upon thoſe virtuous men in our national legiſlature, who conceived this a proper fund, out of which to compenſate the loſſes committed by the unjuſt violences of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. That there are caſes in which the ſequeſtering and even the forfeiture of debts would be proper, can hardly be diſputed; as, for inſtance, where it might prevent the aggreſſor from going into a war, by the fear of loſing a conſiderable ſtake in the hands of his enemy. Where a war has actually broke out, and the ſum due is ſo great as to diſable the debtor nation from carrying it on with effect, if ſhe ſuffered ſo large a balance to be remitted to her enemy; or where the enemy nation relies on that balance, to ſupport her military operations; ſurely it will not be diſputed, that in either of theſe caſes, in which the ſafety of the nation ſo evidently required it, it would be highly imprudent and unjuſt to the people, to ſuffer ſuch debts to be paid. So likewiſe, where the creditor nation had manifeſted the moſt hoſtile intentions, had ſtimulated barbarians to lead your people into captivity—had employed ſavages under their
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:028389_0241_0FD8E94CD1821228"/>influence, to break up your frontiers, and to murder your wives and children—had, without any pretence from juſtice, or the laws of nations, compelled your people to fight under their banners againſt your allies—and had given ſuch interruptions to your commerce, as to diſtreſs and ruin your merchants— ſurely it would be but a ſlight retaliation for theſe wrongs, to ſay to ſuch nation, "we will detain in our hands the balance due to you, till you make ample compenſation for the injury you have done us, and if you do not us us juſtice, we will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the money ourſelves." Our ſituation is very peculiar; the balance we owe to Britain, including ſtock in the funds, banks, &amp;c. cannot be leſs than twenty-five millions of dollars, a much greater ſum than the whole circulating ſpecie of the United States. If it ſhould be known in Britain, that a war with us was intended, as much as poſſible of this capital would inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be withdrawn from America; the conſequence would be, if the government ſhould not interpoſe to prevent the evil, and retain the money, that in the moment that we wanted credit moſt, at the entrance into a war, the nation would be bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt; the banks and merchants to whom it would look for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, would be ruined and unable to afford them aid, while the credit of Britain, ſupported by our payments, would enable them to effect our deſtruction.</p>
                     <p>Again, by the laws of civilized nations, unneceſſary and wanton deſtruction is prohibited; but the ſeaport towns of America are extremely expoſed. Should Britain, in a war with us, or even without war, under ſome trifling pretence, think proper to burn our towns, and by this means ruin the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants that were indebted to them, would it not be juſt in the government, to retaliate upon their merchants, by retaining theſe debts, until compenſation was made, or even to make compenſation themſelves out of this money? and where is the difference between making it anſwer one breach of the law of nations more than another? Why is it leſs proper to compenſate the ſeamen who have loſt their liberty, the family who have loſt a father or a ſon, or a merchant who has loſt his property, by the moſt <hi>direct</hi> violence; than the citizen whoſe wharf and ſtore are wantonly burned? The truth is, that this debt in our hands had a very conſiderable influence upon the politics of Britain, with reſpect to us. There is a great portion of the monied men, who generally go with adminiſtration, that would be ſenſibly affected by the forfeiture, and who are tremblingly alive to every operation of our government with reſpect to it; while we can work upon their fears, they will always be the advocates for peace with us; remove their apprehenſions, and
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:028389_0242_0FD8E94EABC6CD68"/>they will go with adminiſtration. There is great reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the propoſitions in congreſs to ſequeſter this debt, produced the relaxations in their predatory ſyſtem that took place immediately after. Now, that Mr. Jay has convinced them that they have nothing to fear in future, they have renewed them with equal violence. Can any thing be a better comment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary upon the treaty, than the preſent conduct of their marine? I know that much will be ſaid in reply to this, on the ſanctity of public credit, &amp;c. which may indeed prove what I ſhall readily admit, that ſo violent a remedy ſhould not be recurred to on ſlight occaſions; but nothing can be ſaid to prove, that <hi>no occaſion</hi> will juſtify ſuch recurrence, or to convince a free people, that their <hi>repreſentatives</hi> are not the proper judges of the occaſion.</p>
                     <p>The ſtrict law of nations, as laid down both by Vattel and Binherſt, is, that ſuch debts may be forfeited; the USUAL practice is, to ſtay the payment, but, not forfeit the debts; and the <hi>conſtant</hi> practice is, to pay the proceeds of real property, held by the ſubject of an enemy; into the public treaſury, and yet this caſe is much ſtronger than the caſe of debts; becauſe the holder of real property derives his title from the ſtate itſelf; but it is deemed abſurd to let property paſs from a ſtate (when at war) to its rival, in order to feed the fire that is to conſume themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Let me aſk, if a contract were made, during peace, by the merchants of one nation to deliver arms and ammunition to the merchants of another, and a war was to break out, or even to be rendered probable between theſe nations, would it be wrong to ſtop the delivery of thoſe arms, though they ſhould have been actually paid for? And is money leſs a neceſſary of war, in the preſent ſtate of things, than arms? Should we be leſs weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by paying all the current ſpecie of the country, ſtopping our banks, and ſinking the public funds, than by ſending away a few tons of powder, or ſome hundred ſtand of arms? But if the law of nations on this ſubject is clear, to what purpoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into new ſtipulations to give it a more binding force? A breach of the law of nations by an enemy, often renders that right which would otherwiſe have been wrong; <hi>retaliation</hi> is one of the laws of nations; but that law, ſo frequently eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to the ſupport of our rights, is, by this article, entirely taken away, ſo far, at leaſt, as relates to this object. And yet, this is the ground on which we might retaliate with the greateſt proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of ſucceſs. But in any event, as we will always be the debtor nation, to what purpoſe are our hands bound? What equivalent do we receive for this important conceſſion? The
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:028389_0243_0FD8E954D0C6FBA0"/>having it in our power to hold this up in terrorem, if we never made any other uſe of it, might anſwer important purpoſes. Who can ſay, that it may not be at ſometimes proper to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Britiſh from engroſſing too great a ſhare in our ſtocks and banks, or even giving too great a credit to our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants? we already ſee the influence they have acquired over the <hi>politics</hi> of the country by means of theſe.</p>
                     <p>The fact is, that this article is dictated by the ſame princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that pervades ſo many others in the treaty; our trade and navigation are ſurrendered to the Britiſh. Colonies of their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and factors are to be eſtabliſhed on the north and on the weſt, on the ſea coaſt and on the Miſſiſſippi Our banks are to be placed in their hands, and that the thraldom of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try may be complete, every encouragement is to be held out to their brethren in England, to extend their credit and fetter the country by the exceſs of their debt; at the ſame time, all the reſources of the country are to be ſurrendered to them, even out laſt farthing is to be drawn away, whenever it may be found neceſſary to bring us back to our former ſtate of dependence upon their ſovereign. Would it not have been wiſer in Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, to have ſubmitted to the ſtamp act, with the advantages we enjoyed under the Britiſh government, than by yielding to this treaty, to render ourſelves equally dependant, without enjoying the rights of ſubjects? All that ſhe would have drawn away in taxes, would not have equalled our preſent debt; our ſeamen would not have been treated ſo harſhly as they now are; our commerce would have been leſs deranged; and the diſgrace of ſlavery would have been leſs degrading, if we never had been <hi>free.</hi>

                     <p>THE few advocates that the treaty has yet met with, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be zealouſly attached to the conſtitution of the United States; and endeavour to perſuade weak minds that the oppoſition to it has originated in oppoſition to the federal government, and in party views and party principles; yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately for them, it has ſo happened, that the ſtates in which there is leaſt of party ſpirit, manifeſt moſt warmth and moſt unanimity in their oppoſition. Thus South Carolina, and the city of Charleſton particularly, Maryland, Delaware, Jerſey, and New-Hampſhire, have contained no antifederal party; yet
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:028389_0244_0FD8E9581AC09A30"/>they are more decided in their diſapprobation of the treaty, than New York, Philadelphia, or Boſton, where ſuch parties have been ſuppoſed to exiſt. Is it not evident, then, that the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the treaty has received, has originated in party principles, aided by the Britiſh intereſt; while the principal oppoſition, originating with men who are diſtinguiſhed for their attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the federal government, muſt be attributed to pure and diſintereſted patriotiſm, at whoſe ſhrine they have ſacrificed their predilection for men and meaſures, where that predilecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on claſhed with their committee's reports?</p>
                     <p>It is remarkable, too, that if we look over the liſt of names of the perſons who were members of congreſs in 1775 and 1776, and ſubtract from them perſons immediately connected with the government, and who may be ſuppoſed to have influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced the treaty, we ſhall find them decided in their oppoſition to it, even though many of them have for years paſt retired from politics, and in no ſort interfered in the parties of the day.</p>
                     <p>In Carolina, both the Rutledges and Gadſden.—In Virginia, Jefferſon, Madiſon, the grave and moderate Chancellor Wythe, who himſelf preſided at the meeting that addreſſed the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on the ſubject of his proclamation, which was then deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a teſt of violent federaliſm, together with every diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed citizen of that important ſtate, not holding an office.—In Delaware, the celebrated John Dickinſon, the <hi>Pennſylvania farmer,</hi> whoſe enlightened pen was among the firſt, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the moſt diſtinguiſhed, that has been marſhalled on the ſide of American freedom.—In Pennſylvania, Governor Mifflin, Chief Juſtice M'Kean.—In New Jerſey I believe none of the old members of congreſs are now living; but the uniform ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that federal and patriotic ſtate, may be urged as a proof of what their ſentiments would have been, had they lived to bluſh at this blot on their country's honor.—In New York, Floyd and Livingſton are known to be decidedly oppoſed to the treaty. What are thoſe of Schuyler and Duane, Lewis and Morris, the only ſurviving members, Jay excepted, I know not. That Mr. Jay, though he has made the treaty, does not approve of its principles (unleſs, in leed, Mr. Jay the negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, is a different man from Mr. Jay the writer of an addreſs to the citizens of New York on the ſubject of the federal go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment) is obvious; for that addreſs, if examined, will be found to urge our union as a mean to regulate our commerce, or to compel foreign nations to relax their impoſitions, and even to open their iſlands to us; I ſpeak from memory, not having the addreſs before me. Now, if this ſentiment was juſt then, when our numbers, wealth, and reſources, were much
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:028389_0245_0FD8E9598ED228B0"/>leſs than at preſent; and when Britain was at peace, and one hundred millions leſs in debt than at this day, Mr. Jay muſt neceſſarily diſapprove now of a treaty, which puts it out of our power to regulate our own commerce; which confirms all the reſtrictions that we then conſidered as hoſtile to our trade and navigation, and an infinite number of new ones, that did not then exiſt: which, inſtead of opening their iſlands, cloſes them upon us, unleſs we will conſent to purchaſe an inſignificant right to viſit them in <hi>boats,</hi> by a diſgraceful ſurrender of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant part of our commerce. So that we may, on the fulleſt proof, deduced from his unbiaſſed declaration, under his own hand, number Mr. Jay among thoſe who in ſentiment diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of the treaty. The opinions of the then members of Connecticut, if any of them ſurvive, or thoſe of Mr. Samuel Adams or of Mr. Paine (who, however, holds an office) I am unacquainted with. Neither of the gentlemen who then held a place in congreſs, from Rhode Iſland, are now living. The on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurviving member of that day from New Hampſhire (Mr. Langdon) has given his moſt decided oppoſition to the treaty; though in ſo doing, he left his friends in the ſenate in whom he had moſt confidence, and the party with which he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

As far as I have yet learned, not <hi>one native American,</hi> who in thoſe trying times directed the councils of America, and is or has been unconnected with the preſent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, has manifeſted a ſentiment favorable to this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful treaty.

                     <p>To this <hi>poſitive</hi> evidence of the ſenſe of Americans, upon this ſubject, may be added very important negative teſtimony, deduced from the character of its moſt ſtedfaſt ſupporters. Without having a reference to men in office (whoſe views it may be improper to explain) we find every Britiſh ſubject, and every man who has been uniformly hoſtile to American inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, on the ſide of the treaty. That a few others, who wiſh well to their country, have acquieſeed in the meaſure, I am ready to acknowledge; attachment to party, perſonal friendſhip, a conſidence in ſome on whom they are uſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their political ſentiments, family connection, will, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry queſtion, have more or leſs influence.

                     <p>It will be found that no ratification by the preſident and ſenate can carry this treaty into effect, without the concurrence of congreſs; nor, in ſome points, even with ſuch concurrence, without the aid of the ſtate legiſlatures.</p>
                     <p>No rule is better eſtabliſhed, than, that in conſtruing any legal inſtrument, the whole muſt be taken together; that if two different parts appear to militate againſt each other, ſuch a conſtruction, if poſſible, is to be given them, as to render each ſenſible without rejecting either; for it is abſurd to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that contradictions can be intended, or that unmeaning proviſions would be purpoſely inſerted. The conſtitution of the United States has deſined the powers of its different branches—to the executive, it has given a power to make treaties; to the judiciary, a right to judge of <hi>all caſes</hi> ariſing under ſuch treaties; to congreſs, a right to regulate commerce with fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign nations and with the Indians, to define piracy, to <hi>eſtabliſh offices,</hi> to ſettle the ſalary of officers, and to raiſe and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate money. Theſe powers are perfectly diſtinct from each other, and may be all exerciſed without interference—Thus the preſident and ſenate may make treaties of peace, of alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, of neutrality, &amp;c. but not ſuch treaties as ſhall abridge the rights, either of congreſs or of the judiciary, as to thoſe matters that are expreſsly reſerved to them.</p>
                     <p>On the other hand, congreſs ſhall not interfere, in any trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as to thoſe objects which are not expreſsly reſerved to them; nor can they take from the judiciary the right to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine all queſtions ariſing on treaties, while ſuch treaties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in force. On any other conſtruction, one branch of the conſtitution might poſſeſs itſelf of all the powers reſerved to the others. Thus, if the power to make treaties includes a right to regulate commerce, to raiſe money, to declare war, to appoint officers and ſettle their ſalaries, to eſtabliſh new courts and new rules of juriſprudence, to place in other hands, rights reſerved to the judiciary of the United States, to natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralize foreigners, to define and puniſh piracy and other offences againſt the United States, then the preſident and ſenate, by combining with a foreign nation, can inveſt themſelves with all power, and congreſs and the judiciary muſt become uſeleſs. If, for inſtance, the preſident and ſenate can agree that three Britiſh and two Americans, or vice verſa, may draw money at their diſcretion out of the public treaſury, they muſt, as incident to the power, have a right to appropriate public mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:028389_0247_0FD8E963A5F099C8"/>to controul appropriations already made, and to fill the treaſury, if empty, by taxes. For it would be abſurd to ſay, that they have a right to give away public money, and yet that they have no money to give: a clear power always ſuppoſes every thing neceſſary to effectuate ſuch power. If it is ſaid, that they may ſtipulate for the payment of money; but that congreſs may or may not, at their diſcretion, raiſe and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate it to the uſe deſignated by ſuch ſtipulation, then it will follow, that no treaty, which compriſes powers reſerved to congreſs, can be binding, until they give it their ſanction: in ſuch caſe, any ratification by the preſident and ſenate, until they obtain the aſſent of congreſs, muſt be nugatory; and as it may, alſo, involve us in diſagreeable diſcuſſions with foreign powers, it muſt be intended that they have no right to ſuch uſeleſs and perhaps dangerous ratifications. If, indeed, every article made a diſtinct treaty (which I believe will hardly be contended) then they might, without ſuch aſſent, ratify theſe articles which did not interfere with the rights of congreſs, but as to all others they have no power. If, on the other hand, after a treaty is entered into, congreſs have no diſcretion, but muſt neceſſarily enact laws to carry it into effect, all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of government would be reſolvable into the preſident and ſenate, and congreſs are a mere inſtrument in their hands. And to the millions Mr. Jay has already given away by the treaty, might be added, all the wealth of the United States. A treaty of commerce might tax even our exports in the face of the conſtitution; for ſurely if ſuch a treaty can prohibit the exportation of certain commodities as the 12th article does, it might tax them, inaſmuch as a prohibition involves greater power than taxation.</p>
                     <p>If they can create new crimes by treaty, and define the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of them, the whole criminal code is ſubjected to the will of the preſident and ſenate. If they can exempt a favorite nation from the operation of exiſting laws, they may impoſe burdens upon others: for to repeal a law is not leſs a legiſlative act than to make one. Their being able to effectuate this by treaty only, and not in ordinary caſes, inſtead of diminiſhing, adds to the evil, and the danger the conſtitution would incur by this conſtruction; ſince it would thereby enable them to call in a foreign power, to aid in their uſurpations; and as ſuch creaties might be kept ſecret till every neceſſary meaſure was taken to enforce them, all reſiſtance to oppreſſion would be vain; nor could the preſident or ſenate incur any riſk by any attempt to ſeize all powers under pretence of a treaty, if we once admit that a right to make treaties includes every other
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:028389_0248_0FD8E964CFD52578"/>power of government. There are ſo many abſurdities involved in theſe poſitions, that it becomes our duty to ſhew that they do not exiſt in the conſtitution, but are to be avoided by an eaſy and natural conſtruction. Firſt, it appears from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers given to congreſs, that they are in every inſtance to retain their free agency, and cannot be compelled by any other branch of the government to do any act—the words of the conſtitution are, "congreſs ſhall have power;" then follows the enumeration of their powers. They cannot then be forced to raiſe money in conſequence of any treaty, nor to do any other act, derogatory to the rights veſted in them. The laws they have paſſed, or ſhall paſs, in purſuance of ſuch powers, remain in full force, notwithſtanding any treaty the executive may form, derogatory to them; nor is there a word in the conſtitution that ſets trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties above the laws of the United States; both together with the conſtitution itſelf, are called ſupreme laws, as contra-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed to the laws of particular ſtates only. The words in article VI. of the conſtitution are, "This conſtitution and the laws of the United States, which ſhall be made in purſuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which ſhall be made, under the authority of the United States, ſhall be the ſupreme law of the land. And the judges in every ſtate, ſhall be bound thereby, any thing in the conſtitution or laws of any ſtate to the contrary notwithſtanding." It will certainly not be pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that treaties are ſuperior to the conſtitution, under which they are made; on the contrary, as it is held that laws them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have no force in oppoſition to the conſtitution; ſo it may be inferred from the order in which they are placed, as well as the reaſon of the thing, that treaties are inferior in force to laws.—Were it otherwiſe, when a treaty was once ratified, however it might be abuſed, how deſtructive ſoever it might be to the United States in its operation, we never could get rid of it; becauſe the judges, who are ſworn to obſerve the laws, would enforce it. And yet there are many caſes, enumerated by the writers on the law of nations, in which a treaty may be juſtifiably broken; and numberleſs reaſons may exiſt with the ſovereign of the country for violating it.</p>
                     <p>The only true and ſound conſtruction of the conſtitution is, that treaties are to have the force of laws; but, like all other laws, are ſubject to the will of the ſovereign, that is, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs; that the power of the preſident in making treaties, can only extend to caſes that are <hi>not reſerved</hi> by the conſtitution to congreſs; that whenever he negociates as to other objects, his negociations muſt be authorized by a prior or ſubſequent law. Though this conſtruction may involve ſome <hi>inconveniencies,</hi> yet
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:028389_0249_0FD8E9665331F4A8"/>it avoids <hi>abſurdities.</hi> It gives force to every part of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it rejects no proviſions in it, nor makes one part claſh with another. It is conſiſtent with the practice in mixed go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments—thus, in Britain, the king may make treaties; but, when money is neceſſary to carry them into effect, when they claſh with the laws of the nation, a legiſlative proviſion is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to give them effect. And the parliament can at any time make laws in the face of a treaty; though, until ſuch laws are made, the treaty is reſpected by the courts. Whatever has been ſaid with reſpect to the rights of the preſident and ſenate, as oppoſed to the excluſive rights of congreſs, applies with equal force to the rights of ſtates; where the treaty is made relative to objects not ſurrendered by them, the treaty that is binding upon them, muſt be conſtitutionally made, and conſiſt with the powers yielded to the federal government; otherwiſe the preſident might barter away the independence of individual ſtates, which makes a neceſſary part of the conſtitution of the United States, and which is expreſsly guaranteed.</p>
                     <p>Now, let us apply theſe principles to the treaty—And to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the ſixth article. By this article commiſſioners are to be appointed, two by the Britiſh king, two by the preſident and ſenate; the fifth by the other four, or by lot. Theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners are to ſit <hi>as a court,</hi> to determine queſtions relative to the demands of the Britiſh merchants—They are to examine the parties on oath, to fix their <hi>own</hi> rules of evidence, and to decide <hi>not by the laws of the country,</hi> but according to their ideas of j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                           <desc>••••</desc>
                        </gap>tice and equity. Their deciſion is to be both <hi>arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and final.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt enquiry is into the <hi>right</hi> of the preſident and ſenate to appoint the commiſſioners contemplated by this article. If they have any ſuch right, it muſt be derived from the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for it will not be pretended that the king of Great Britain can give them new rights, or that they can enlarge their own power, by entering into a treaty with a foreign nation. Yet the only powers the preſident and ſenate have, relative to this object, are, to "appoint ambaſſadors, other public miniſters and conſuls, judges of the ſupreme court, and all other officers of the United States, whoſe appointments are not herein pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, <hi>and which ſhall be eſtabliſhed by law.</hi>" Here the officers that the executive may appoint, are <hi>enumerated;</hi> and ſo careful is the conſtitution to prevent their uſing any impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per diſcretion, in the creation of unneceſſary officers, that it expreſsly limits the powers of appointment as to all others, <hi>to ſuch as ſhall be eſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                        </gap> by the treaty are in
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:028389_0250_0FD8E96CDDAF0B78"/>the claſs of enumerated officers—They are not ambaſſadors, conſuls, judges of the ſupreme court, nor are they <hi>eſtabliſhed by law.</hi> To ſay that the treaty is a law, and that therefore all officers eſtabliſhed by treaty, are eſtabliſhed by law, would only be to argue in a circle, and to go back <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o the point we ſtarted from. It would be to aſſert, that every thing might be done by treaty, which could be done by law; and, as I have before ſaid, that under the form of a treaty, the preſident and ſenate might aſſume all powers, legiſlative, executive, and judiciary. The queſtion then is, whether they are the <hi>public miniſters</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated by the conſtitution? It is evident, from the words <hi>public miniſters,</hi> following the word <hi>ambaſſadors,</hi> and preceding the word <hi>conſuls,</hi> that diplomatic miniſters only could be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; ſince it takes the higheſt and loweſt of theſe, and uſes general words to "other public miniſters," to deſignate the various intermediate grades. But ſurely, commiſſioners, who are to hold their ſeſſions in our own country, and to determine queſtions of private juriſprudence, cannot in this ſenſe be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated public miniſters; as well might we call the auditor a public miniſter, becauſe he ſettles the accounts of ſtrangers and citizens; or the attorney general, whoſe duty it is to ſee that the ſubjects of foreign princes are not maltreated. In one ſenſe, indeed, not only they, but every other officer of the ſtate, is a public miniſter; but that this is not the ſenſe of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is evident from its enumerating certain public officers, as, for inſtance, judges of the ſupreme court (who, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>ring the right of appointment, as to all others; "to ſuch as ſhall be <hi>eſtabliſhed by law</hi>" it is evident, that the conſtitution muſt have aſſixed ſome ſpecific idea to the words "other public miniſters." What that idea was, appears clearly from the context; and it would be the groſſeſt abuſe, to extend it to a ſpecies of officers that never exiſted either in this, nor, as I believe, in any other country in the world. In the third ſection, the ſame idea is ſtill purſued—"He ſhall receive ambaſſadors and other public mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters."</p>
                     <p>The conſtitution alſo preſerves a right to veſt the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of officers (other than thoſe enumerated) either in the preſident <hi>alone,</hi> the <hi>courts of law,</hi> or the <hi>heads of departments.</hi> By what authority, then, can Mr. Jay and Lord Grenville, or the preſident and ſenate, over-rule the conſtitution, and aſſume a power to controul the rights of congreſs, to create the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and to place it in ſuch hands as they think proper, under the above limitations? But ſuch are the powers of theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, as even congreſs itſelf cannot authorize, without
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:028389_0251_0FD8E96DD87D4598"/>viclating the conſtitution.—They are to determine upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain rights, which Britiſh ſubjects claim <hi>under the treaty of Paris,</hi> which was an exiſting treaty at the time the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was acceded to; of courſe, muſt have been in contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when the ſecond ſection of the third article of the ſede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſtitution declared, "that the judicial power <hi>ſhall</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ALL CASES in <hi>law and equity</hi> ariſing under this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, the laws of the United States, and <hi>treaties made,</hi> or which <hi>ſhall be made,</hi> under their authority." "In all caſes of admiralty and maritime juriſdiction, to controverſies to which the <hi>United States ſhall be a party.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>Now, let me aſk, whether the caſes that are to fall under the juriſdiction of theſe commiſſioners are not, 1ſt, A caſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>a treaty made?</hi> and 2d, whether the United States are not parties? What power then exiſts either in the preſident and ſenate, or even in the legiſlature, to aſſume this right, which the union has veſted in a judiciary, whom it has expreſsly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be independent of both: Or will it be ſaid, that the power of making treaties, implies a right to trample under foot every check that the conſtitution has provided againſt the abuſes of either branch of government? Should the treaſurer of the United States pay money out of the treaſury in purſuance of any adjudication of theſe commiſſioners, and be afterwards called to an account for the ſame, before the judges of the ſupreme court, could he expect that they would ſuffer him to iſſue an order which claſhes with their own powers and dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">

That the agreement to forbear to lay duties of entry on pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, is the ſurrender, without equivalent, of a valuable item of revenue, and will give the Britiſh the facility of carrying on their fur trade through us, with the uſe of our advantages.</item>
                           <item>4. That the articles, which will be brought from Europe into Canada, coming duty free, can be afforded cheaper than the ſame articles going thither from us, charged with a heavy duty on their importation into the United States, and with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe of a long tranſportation by land, and inland navigation.</item>
                           <item>5. That the population of Canada, which, by a cenſus in 1784, amounted only to 123, 082 ſouls, is too ſmall to render the ſupply of European and Aſiatic commodities, throu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

Theſe ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions will be diſcuſſed in the order in which they are here ſtated:—</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is true, that the country of the Hudſon's Bay compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is not well defined. Their charter, granted in 1670, gives them "the ſole trade and commerce of and to all the ſeas, bays, ſtreights, creeks, lakes, rivers, and ſounds, in whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever latitude they ſhall be, that he within the entrance of the ſtreights commonly called Hudſon's Streights, together with all the lands, countries, and territories upon the coaſts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of the ſaid ſeas, ſtreights, bays, &amp;c. <hi>which are now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually poſſeſſed by any of our ſubjects, or by the ſubjects of any other Chriſtian prince of ſtate</hi>"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="254" facs="unknown:028389_0253_0FD8E970130A0DD0"/>
To aſcertain their territorial limits, according to charter, it would be neceſſary to know what portion of country, at the time of the grant, was <hi>actually poſſeſſed</hi> by the ſubjects of Great Britain, or of ſome other Chriſtian prince or ſtate; but though this be not known, the general hiſtory of the country, as to ſettlement, will demonſtrate, that it could not have extended far weſtward, certainly not to that region which is the ſcene of trade in furs, commonly called the north weſt trade, carried on by the Canada company from Canada; the poſſeſſion of whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>, as far as poſſeſſion exiſts, is recent. We learn from a traveller who has lately viſited that region, that one of this company's eſtabliſhments is in lat. 56, 9, N. long. 117, 43, W. that is, about 20 degrees of longitude weſtward of the lake of the Woods; and it is generally underſtood, that the entire ſcene of the trade of this company is weſtward of the limits of the Hudſon's Bay company.</p>
                     <p>Canada, on the north, is bounded by the territories of the Hudſon's Bay company.—This is admitted by the treaty of Utrecht, and eſtabliſhed by the act of parliament in 1774, commonly called the Quebec act.—The treaty of Utrecht pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides for the ſettlement of the boundaries by commiſſaries. I have not been able to trace whether the line was ever actually ſo ſettled; but ſeveral maps lay down a line as the one ſettled by the treaty of Utrecht, which runs north of the lake of the Woods.</p>
                     <p>In a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>through Canada. This will reſult both from the certainty that there were no actual poſſeſſions, at the dare of the charter, ſo far interior, and from the fact of the trade being carried on through a different channel, by a different company, under the ſuperintendance and protection of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent government, that of Canada. It may be aſked, why was the article embarraſſed by the exception of the country of the Hudſon's Bay company? The anſwer is this, That the charter of this company gives to it a monopoly within its limits, and, therefore, a right to trade there could not have been granted, with propriety, to a foreign power, by treaty. It is true that it has been queſtioned, whether this monopoly was valid againſt Britiſh ſubjects, ſeeing that the charter had not been confirmed by act of parliament. But beſides that this doubt has been conſined to Britiſh ſubjects, it would appear, that, in fact, the company has enjoyed the monopoly granted by its charter, even againſt them, and with at leaſt the implied approbation of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. In the year 1749, petitions were preferred to the
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:028389_0254_0FD8E9720C5881D8"/>houſe of commons, by different trading towns in England, for reſcinding the monopoly, and opening the trade.—An enquiry was inſtituted by the houſe. The report of its committee was favorable, to the conduct and pretenſions of the company, and againſt the expediency of opening the trade; and the buſineſs terminated there.</p>
                     <p>This circumſtance of there being a monopoly, confirms the argument drawn from the fact, that the north weſt trade is carried on through Canada by the Canada company: a deciſive preſumption, that the ſcene of that trade is not within the country of the Hudſon's Bay company, and is, conſequently, within the operation of the privilege granted to us.</p>
                     <p>Though it will be partly a digreſſion, I cannot forbear, in this place, to notice ſome obſervations of CATO, in his Xth number—After ſtating, that in 1784 the peltry from Canada ſold in London for 230, 000 <abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling, he proceeds to obſerve, that, excluding the territories of the Hudſon's Bay company, nine-tenths of this trade is within the limits of the United States; and, though with ſtudied ambiguity of expreſſion, he endeavours to have it underſtood, that nine-tenths of the trade which yielded the peltry, that ſold for 230, 000 <abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling in 1784, was within our territories. It is natural to aſk, how he has aſcertained the limits of the Hudſon's Bay company (which, at other times, is aſſerted, by way of objection to the article, to be altogether indefinite) with ſo much exactneſs as to be able to pronounce what proportion, if any, of the trade carried on through Canada may have come from that country, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>wards the calculation which has led to the concluſion, that nine-tenths of the whole lies within our limits? The truth is indubitably and notoriouſly, that whether any or whatever part of the peltry exported from Canada may come from the country of the Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's Bay company, ſeven-eights<note n="*" place="bottom">Some ſtatements rate it between ſix-eights and ſeven-eighths.</note> of the whole trade which fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes that peltry, has its ſource on the Britiſh ſide of the boundary line. It follows, that if it were even true, that only one-tenth of the whole lay in that part of the Britiſh territory, which is not of the Hudſon's Bay company, inaſmuch as only one-ſeventh of it lies within our limits, the reſult would be, that the trade, in which we granted an equal privilege, was to that in which a like privilege is granted to us, as one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeventh to one-tenth, and not, according to Cato, as nine to one. This legerdemain, in argument and calculation, is really too frivolous for ſo ſerious a ſubject. Or, to ſpeak more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, it is too ſhocking, by the ſpirit of deception which it
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:028389_0255_0FD8E9730F6B47E8"/>betrays. Cato has a further obſervation, with regard to the trade with the Indians, in the vicinity of the Miſſiſſppi, and from that river into the Spaniſh territories.—The product of all this trade, he ſays, muſt go down the Miſſiſſippi, and, but for the ſtipulation of the third article, would have been excluſively ours; becauſe, "by the treaty of Paris, though the Britiſh might navigate the Miſſiſſippi, yet they did not own a foot of land upon either of its banks; whereas the United States poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing all the Indian country, in the vicinity of that river and the eaſt bank for many hundred miles, could, when they pleaſed, eſtabliſh factories and monopolize that commerce." This aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with regard to the treaty of Paris, is in every ſenſe incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect; for the ſeventh article of that treaty, eſtabliſhes as a boundary between the dominions of France and his Britannic majeſty, "a line drawn along the middle of the river Miſſiſſip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi, from its ſource to the river Iberville, and from thence by a line drawn along the middle of this river and the lakes Maure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas and Pont Chartraim to the ſea," and cedes to his Britannic majeſty all the country on the eaſt ſide of the Miſſiſſippi. By the treaty of Paris then, his Britannic majeſty owned all, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the town and iſland of New Orleans, the territory on the eaſt ſide of the Miſſiſſippi, inſtead of not having a foot of land there.</p>
                     <p>What part of this territory does not ſtill belong to him, is a point not yet ſettled. The treaty of peace between the United States and Great Britain, ſuppoſes that part will remain to Great Britain; for one line of boundary between us and her, deſignated by that treaty is a line due weſt from the lake of the woods to the Miſſiſſippi. If, in fact, this river runs far enough north to be interfected by ſuch a line, according to the ſuppoſition of the laſt mentioned treaty, ſo much of that river, and the land upon it, as ſhall be north of the line of interſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will continue to be of the dominion of Great Britain. The lately-made treaty, not abandoning the poſſibility of this being the caſe, provides for a ſurvey to aſcertain the fact; and in every event, the intent of the treaty of peace will require, that ſome cloſing line, more or leſs direct, ſhall be drawn from the lake of the Woods to the Miſſiſſippi. The poſition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that Great Britain has no land or ports on the Miſſiſſippi, takes for granted, what is not aſcertained, and of which the contrary is preſumed by the treaty of peace.</p>
                     <p>The trade with the Indian country on our ſide of the Miſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſippi, from the Ohio to the lake of the Woods (if that river extends ſo far north) ſome fragments excepted, has its preſent direction through Detriot and Michillimachinac, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:028389_0256_0FD8E979767FB8A0"/>in many calculations, heretofore ſtated, of the proportion which the Indian trade within our limits, bears to that within the Britiſh limits. Its eſtimated amount is even underſtood to embrace the proceeds of a clandeſtine trade with the Spainſh territories; ſo that the new ſcene ſuddenly explored by Cato, is old and trodden ground, the ſpecial reference to which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not vary the reſults that have been preſented. It is ſtill unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably and notoriouſly true, that the fur trade within our limits, bears no proportion to that within the Britiſh limits. As to a contingent traffic with the territories of Spain, each party will be free to purſue it according to right and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; each would have, independent of the treaty, the facility of bordering territories. The geography of the beſt regions of the fur trade, in the Spaniſh territories, is too little known, to be much reaſoned upon; and if the Spaniards, according to their uſual policy, incline to exclude their neighbours, their precautions along the Miſſiſſippi will render the acceſs to it circuitous: a circumſtance which makes it problematical, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the poſſeſſion of the oppoſite bank is, as to that object, an advantage or not, and whether we may not find it conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to be able, under the treaty, to take a circuit through the Britiſh territories.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is upon the ſuggeſtion of Great Britain having no ports on the Miſſiſſippi, that the charge of want of reciprocity in the privileges granted, with regard to the uſe of that river, is founded. The ſuggeſtion has been ſhown to be more peremptory than is juſtified by facts. Yet it is ſtill true, that the ports on our ſide bear no proportion to any that can exiſt on the part of the Britiſh, according to the preſent ſtate of territory. It will be examined in a ſubſequent place, how far this diſproportion is a proper rule in the eſtimate of reciprocity. But let it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, in the mean time, that in judging of the reciprocity of an article, it is to be taken collectively. If, upon the whole, the privileges obtained, are as valuable as thoſe granted, there is a ſubſtantial reciprocity; and to this teſt, upon full and fair examination of the article, I freely refer the deciſion. Beſides, if the ſituation of Great Britain did not permit in this particular, a preciſe equivalent, it will not follow that the grant on our part was improper, unleſs it can be ſhown, that it was attended with ſome inconvenience, injury, or loſs to us; a thing which has not been, and I believe cannot be ſhown. Perhaps there is a very importantly beneficial ſide to this queſtion. The treaty of peace eſtabliſhed between us and Great Britain, a common intereſt in the Miſſiſſippi; the preſent treaty ſtrengthens that common intereſt. Every body knows, that the uſe of the river is denied ſo by Spain, and that it is an Indiſpenſible outlet to
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:028389_0257_0FD8E97AAB756590"/>our weſtern country. Is it an inconvenient thing to us, that the intereſt of Great Britain has, in this particular, been more completely ſeparated from that of Spain and more cloſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with ours?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The agreement to forbear to lay duties of entry on pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, is completely defenſible on the following grounds, viz. It is the general policy of commercial nations to exempt raw materials from duty. This has likewiſe been the uniform policy of the United States; and it has particularly embraced the article of <hi>peltries,</hi> which, by our exiſting laws, may be import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into any part of the United States <hi>free from duty.</hi> The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this regulation is the encouragement of manufactures, by facilitating a cheap ſupply of raw materials. A duty of entry, therefore, as to ſuch part of the article as might be worked up at home, would be prejudicial to our manufacturing intereſt; as to ſuch part as might be exported, if the duty was not drawn back, would injure our commercial intereſt. But it is the general policy of our laws, in conformity with the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of other commercial countries, to draw back and return the duties which are charged upon the importation of foverign commodities. This has reference to the advancement of the export trade of the country; ſo that, with regard to ſuch pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries as ſhould be re-exported, there would be no advantage to our revenue from having laid a duty of entry. Such a duty, then, being contrary to our eſtabliſhed ſyſtem and to true princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, there can be no objection to a ſtipulation againſt it.— As to its having the effect of making our country the channel of the Britiſh trade in peltries, this, if true, and it is indeed probable, could not but promote our intereſt. A large propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the profits would then neceſſarily remain with us, to, compenſate for tranſportation and agencies. It is likely, too that to ſecure the fidelity of agents, as is uſual, copartnerſhips would be formed, of which Britiſh capital would be the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal inſtrument, and which would throw a ſtill greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the profits into our hands. The more we can make our country the entrepot, the emporium of the trade of foreigners, the more we ſhall profit. There is no commercial principle more obvious than this, more univerſally agreed, or more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally nerally practiſed upon, in countries where commerce is well underſtood.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The fourth of the above enumerated ſuggeſtions, is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, in its principal point, by the practice juſt ſtated, of drawing back the duties on importation, when articles are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exported. This would place the articles, which we ſhould ſend into the Britiſh territories, exactly upon the ſame footing, as
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:028389_0258_0FD8E97D927743B0"/>to duties, with the ſame articles imported there from Europe. With regard to the additional expenſe of tranſportation, this is another inſtance of the contradiction of an argument, which has been relied upon by both ſides, which is, that taking the voyage from Europe in conjunction with the interior tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, the advantage, upon the whole, is likely to be in our favor. And it is upon this aggregate tranſportation, that the calculation ought to be made. With reſpect to India or Aſiatic articles, there is the circumſtance of a double voyage.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. As to the ſmall population of Canada, which is urged to depreciate the advantages of the trade with the white inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of thoſe countries, it is to be obſerved, that this popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not ſtationary. If the date of the cenſus be rightly quoted, it was taken eleven years ago, when there were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy 123, 082 ſouls. It is preſumable, that this number will ſoon be doubled; for it is notorious, that ſettlement has proceeded for ſome years with conſiderable rapidity in Upper Canada; and there is no reaſon to believe that the future progreſs will be ſlow. In time to come, the trade may grow into real mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude; but be it more or leſs beneficial, it is ſo much gaified by the article; and ſo much clear gain, ſince it has been ſhown not to be true, that it is counterbalanced by a ſacrifice in the fur trade.</p>
                     <p n="6">With regard to the ſuppoſed danger of ſmuggling, in the intercourſe permitted by this article, it is very probable, it will be found leſs than if it were prohibited. Entirely to prevent trade between bordering territories is a very arduous, perhaps an impracticable taſk. If not authorized, ſo much as is carried on muſt be illicit; and it may be reaſonably preſumed, that the extent of illicit trade will be much greater in that caſe, than where an intercourſe is permitted, under the uſual regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and guards. In the laſt caſe, the inducement to it is leſs, and ſuch as will only influence perſons of little character or principle, while every fair trader is, from private intereſt, a centinel to the laws; in the other caſe, all are intereſted to break through the barriers of a rigorous and apparently unkind prohibition. This conſideration has probably had its weight with our government in opening a communication through lake Champlain with Canada; of the principle of which regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, the treaty is only an extenſion.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The pretended inequality of the article, as ariſing from the greater extent of the United States than of the Britiſh ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, is one of thoſe fanciful poſitions, which are ſo apt to haunt the brains of viſionary politicians. Traced through all its conſequences, it would terminate in this, that a great em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:028389_0259_0FD8E97F18C8D170"/>could never form a treaty of commerce with a ſmall one; for, to equalize advantages according to the ſcale of territory, the ſmall ſtate muſt compenſate for its deficiency in extent, by a greater <hi>quantum</hi> of poſitive privilege, in proportion to the difference of extent, which would give the larger ſtate the monopoly of its trade. According to this principle, what wretched treaties have we made with France, Sweden, Pruſſia, and Holland! For our territories exceed in extent thoſe of either of theſe powers. How immenſe the ſacrifice in the caſe of Holland; for the United States are one hundred times larger than the United Provinces.</p>
                     <p>But how are we ſure, that the extent of the United States is greater than the territories of Great Britain on our conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent? We know that ſhe has pretenſions to extend to the Paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice Ocean, and to embrace a vaſt wilderneſs, incomparably larger than the United States, and we are told, as already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, that her trading eſtabliſhments now actually extend beyond the 56th degree of north latitude, and 117th degree of weſt longitude.</p>
                     <p>Shall we be told (ſhifting the original ground) that not extent of territory, but extent of population is the meaſure? Then how great is the advantage which we gain in this particular, by the treaty at large? The population of Great Britain is to that of the United States, about two and a half to one; and the comparative conceſſion by her in the trade between her Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean dominions and the United States, muſt be in the ſame ratio. When we add to this the great population of her Eaſt India poſſeſſions, in which privileges are granted to us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any return, how prodigiouſly will the value of the treaty be enhanced, according to this new and extraordinary rule!</p>
                     <p>But the rule is, in fact, an abſurd one, and only merits the notice which has been taken of it, to exhibit the weak grounds of the oppoſition to the treaty. The great ſtandard of recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city is equal privilege. The adventitious circumſtances, which may render it more beneficial to one party than the other, can ſeldom be taken into the account, becauſe they can ſeldom he eſtimated with certainly; the relative extent of country or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, is of all others, a moſt fallacious guide.</p>
                     <p>The comparative reſources and facilities for mutual ſupply, regulate the relative utility of a commercial privilege; and as far as population is concerned, it may be laid down, as a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rule, that the ſmalleſt population graduates the ſcale of the trade on both ſides, ſince it is at once the principal meaſure of what the ſmaller ſtate can furniſh to the greater, and of what it can take from the greater; or, in other words, of what the
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:028389_0260_0FD8E980991D1F78"/>greater ſtate can find a demand for in the ſmaller ſtate. But this rule, too, like moſt general ones, admits of numerous exceptions.</p>
                     <p>In caſe of a trade by land and inland navigation, the ſphere of the operation of any privilege can only extend a certain diſtance. When the diſtance to a given point, through a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular channel, is ſuch that the expenſe of tranſportation would render an article dearer than it could be brought through ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther channel to the ſame point, the privilege to carry the article through that particular channel to ſuch point, becomes of no avail. Thus the privilege of trading by land or inland naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Britiſh territories on this continent, can procure to that country no advantage of trade with Princeton in New-Jerſey, becauſe ſupplies can come to it on better terms from other quarters. Whence we perceive, that the abſolute extent of territory or population of the United States, is no meaſure of the relative value of the privileges reciprocally granted by the article under conſideration, and, conſequently, no criterion of the real reciprocity of the article.</p>
                     <p>The objectors to the treaty have marſhalled againſt this arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle a quaint figure, of which from the uſe of it in different quarters, it is preſumable they are not a little enamoured; it is this, that the article enables Great Britain to draw <hi>a line of circumvallation</hi> round the United States. They hope to excite prejudice, by preſenting to the mind, the image of a ſiege or inveſtment of the country. If trade be war, they have choſen a moſt apt figure; and we cannot but wonder, how the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate iſland of Great Britain, has been able ſo long to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her independence amidſt the beleaguering efforts of the number of nations with whom ſhe has been imprudent enough to form treaties of commerce; and who, from her inſular ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, have it in their power to beſet and hem her in on all ſides. How lucky it is for the United States, that at leaſt one ſide is covered by Spain, and that this formidable line of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvallation cannot be completely perfected! or rather how hard driven muſt thoſe be, who are obliged to call to their aid, auxiliaries ſo prepoſterous!</p>
                     <p>Can any good reaſon be given, why one ſide of a country ſhould not be acceſſible to foreigners, for purpoſes of trade, equally with another? Might not the cultivators on the ſide from which they were excluded, have cauſe to complain, that the carriage of their productions was ſubject to an increaſed charge, by a monopoly of the national navigation; while the cultivators in other quarters enjoyed the benefit of a competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between that and foreign navigation? and might not all the inhabitants have a right to demand a reaſon, why their
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:028389_0261_0FD8E98BD3D0FF80"/>commerce ſhould be leſs open and free, than that of other parts of the country? Will privileges of trade extend the line of territorial circumvallation? Will not the extent of contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Britiſh territory remain the ſame, whether the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of trade are open or ſhut? By opening them, may we not rather be ſaid to make ſo many breaches in the wall, or intrenchment, of this newly invented circumvallation? if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it be not enchanted!</p>
                     <p>The argument upon this article, has hitherto turned, as to the trade with the white inhabitants of the Britiſh territories on European and Eaſt India goods. But there can be no doubt that a mutually-beneficial commerce in native commodition ought to be included in the catalogue of advantages. Already there is a uſeful interchange of certain commodities, which time and the progreſs of ſettlement and reſources cannot fail to extend. It is moſt probable, too, that a conſiderable part of the productions of the Britiſh territories will find the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient channel to foreign markets through us; which, as for as it regards the intereſt of external commerce, will yield li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap> leſs advantage, than if they proceeded from our own ſoil or induſtry. It is evident, in particular, that as far as this ſhall be the caſe, it will prevent a great part of the competition with our commodities which would exiſt, if thoſe productions took other routes to foreign markets.</p>
                     <p>In conſidering the ſubject, on the ſide of a trade in home commodities, it is an imporrtant reflection, that the United States are much more advanced in induſtrious improvement, than the Britiſh territories. This will give us a material and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advantage. While their articles of exchange with us will eſſentially conſiſt in the products of agriculture and of mines, we ſhall add to theſe, manufactures of various and multiplying kinds, ſerving to increaſe the balance in our favor.</p>
                     <p>In proportion as the article is viewed on enlarged plan and permanent ſcale, its importance to us magnifies. Who can ſay how far Britiſh colonization may ſpread ſouthward and down the weſt ſide of the Miſſiſſippi, northward and weſtward into the vaſt interior regions towards the Pacific Ocean? Can we view it as a matter of indifference, that this new world is eventually laid open to our enterprize, to an enterprize ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the immenſe advantage already mentioned, of a more improved ſtate of induſtry? Can we be inſenſible, that the precedent furniſhes us with a cogent and perſuaſive argument to bring Spain to a ſimilar arrangement? And can we be blind to the great intereſt we have, obtaining a free communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:028389_0262_0FD8E98BD5FCFB88"/>with all the territories that environ our country, from the St. Mary's to the St. Croix.</p>
                     <p>In this large view of the ſubject, the fur trade, which has made a very prominent figure in the diſcuſſion, becomes a point ſcarcely viſible. Objects of great variety and magnitude, ſtart up in perſpective, eclipſing the little atoms of the day, and promiſing to grow and mature with time.</p>
                     <p>The reſult of the whole is, that the United States; make by the third article of the treaty a good bargain—that with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the fur trade, with equality of privileges and ſuperior advantages of ſituation, we ſtake one againſt ſeven, or at moſt one againſt ſix—that as to the trade in European and Eaſt Indian goods and in home productions, we make an equal ſtake with ſome advantages of ſituation—that we open an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe field of future enterprize—that we avoid embarraſſments and dangers ever attendant on an artificial and prohibitory policy, which, in reference to the Indian nations, was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly difficult and hazardous—and that we ſecure thoſe of a natural and liberal policy, and give the faireſt chances for good neighbourhood between the United States and the bordering Britiſh territories, and conſequently of good underſtanding with Great Britain, conducing to the ſecurity of our peace. Experience, no doubt, will demonſtrate that the horrid ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres which have been conjured up, are fictions; and if it ſhould even be ſlow to realize the predicted benefits (for time will be requiſite to give permanent cauſes their due effect in controul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing temporary circumſtances) it will at laſt prove, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted evils are chimeras and cheats.</p>

                     <p>Theſe articles, though they have been adjuſted with critical propriety, have not eſcaped cenſure. They have even in one inſtance been ſeverely reprobated, as bringing into queſtion, things about which there was no room for any—and which a bare inſpection of the map was ſufficient to ſettle.</p>
                     <p>With regard to the Miſſiſſippi, there is no ſatisfactory evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that it has ever been explored to its ſource.—It is even aſſerted, that it has never been aſcended beyond the 45th de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of north latitude, about a degree above the falls of St. Anthony. Fadeus's map in 1793, will ſerve as a ſpecimen of the great uncertainty which attends this matter. It notes that the river had not been aſcended beyond the degree of latitude juſt mentioned, and exhibits three ſtreams, one connected with the <hi>Marſhy Lake</hi> in that latitude, another with the <hi>White Bear Lake</hi> near the 46th degree, and the third with the <hi>Red Lake</hi> in the 47th degree; denominating each of the two firſt, "the Miſſiſſippi by conjecture," and the laſt, "Red Lake River, or Laboutan's Miſſiſſippi,"—all of them falling conſiderably
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:028389_0264_0FD8E9904DDCEB70"/>ſhort, in their northern extent, of the lake of the Woods, which is placed as high as the fiftieth degree of north latitude. Thus ſtands this very clear and certain point, which, we are told, it was diſgraceful on the part of our envoy to have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to be brought into queſtion.</p>
                     <p>There is, however, a ſpecific topic of blame of the article which has greater plauſibility. It is this, that it does not finally ſettle the queſtion, but refers the adjuſtment of the cloſing line to future negociation, in caſe it ſhould turn out that the river does not ſtretch far enough north to be interſected by an eaſt and weſt line from the lake of the Woods. I anſwer, that the arrangement is preciſely ſuch as it ought to have been. It would have been premature to provide a ſubſtitute till it was aſcertained that it was neceſſary—This could only be done by an actual ſurvey—A ſurvey is therefore provided for and will be made at the joint expenſe of the two countries.</p>
                     <p>That ſurvey will not only determine whether a ſubſtitute be requiſite or not; but it will furniſh data for judging what ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute is proper, and moſt conformable to the true intent of the treaty.—Without the data which it will afford, any thing that could have been done, would have been too much a leap in the dark. National acts, eſpecially on the important ſubject of boundary; ought to be bottomed on a competent knowledge of circumſtances. It ought to be clearly underſtood how much is retained, how much is relinquiſhed. Had our envoy proceeded on a different principle, if what he had agreed to had turned out well, it would have been regarded as, the lucky reſult of an act of ſupererogation—If it had proved diſadvantageous, it would have been ſtigmatized as an act of improvidence and imprudence.</p>
                     <p>The ſtrong argument for having ſettled an alternative is the avoiding of future diſpute. But what alternative could have been agreed upon, which might not have bred controverſy? The cloſing line muſt go directly or indirectly to the Miſſiſſippi—which of the ſtreams reputed or conjectured to be ſuch, above the falls of St. Anthony, is beſt emitted to be ſo confidered? To what known point was the line to be directed? How was that point to be identiſied with adequate certainty? The diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of anſwering theſe queſtions, will evince, that the danger of controverſy might have been increaſed by an impatience to avoid it, and by anticipating, without the neceſſary lights, an adjuſtment which they ought to direct.</p>
                     <p>The facts, with regard to the river St. Croix, are theſe: the queſtion is, which of two rivers is the true St. Croix. The diſpute concerning it is as old as the French poſſeſſion of Nova
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:028389_0265_0FD8E9921396D4E0"/>Scotia. France ſet up one river; Great Britain another. The point was undecided when the ſurrender of Nova Scotia by the former to the latter, put an end to the queſtion as between thoſe parties—It was afterwards renewed between the colonies of Nova Scotia and Maſſachuſetts Bay, which laſt, in the year 1762, appointed commiſſioners to aſcertain, in conjunction with commiſſioners which might be appointed by the province of Nova Scotia, the true river, but no final ſettlement of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enſued.</p>
                     <p>The treaty of peace gives us for one boundary, the river St. Croix, but without deſignating it. Hence it has happened, that not long after the peace was concluded, the queſtion, which had been before agitated between France and Great Britain, and between the provinces of Maſſachuſetts and Nova Scotia, was revived between the ſtate of Maſſachuſetts and that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and it has ever ſince continued a ſubject of debate.</p>
                     <p>A mode of ſettling the diſpute was under the conſideration of congreſs in the year 1785; and powers were given to our then miniſter at the court of London, to adjuſt the affair, but nothing was concluded. And we learn from a letter of Mr. Jefferſon to Mr. Hammond, dated the 15th December, 1791, that it then alſo, engaged the attention of our government; that the aſcertaining of the point in diſpute was deemed a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of "preſent urgency," and that it had before been the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of application from the United States to the government of Great Britain.</p>
                     <p>It is natural to ſuppoſe, that a diſpute of ſuch antiquity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſuch different parties, is not without colourable founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on either ſide: at any rate, it was eſſential to the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of peace that it ſhould be adjuſted.</p>
                     <p>If one party could not convince the other by argument, of the ſuperior ſolidity of its pretenſions, I know of no alternative but arbitration or war. Will any one pretend that honor required us in ſuch a caſe to go to war, or that the object was of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to make it our intereſt to refer it to that ſolemn, calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, and precarious iſſue? No rational man will anſwer this queſtion in the affirmative. It follows, that an arbitration was the proper courſe, and that our envoy acted rightly in acceding to this expedient. It is one, too, not without precedents among nations, though it were to be wiſhed, for the credit of human moderation, that they were more frequent.</p>
                     <p>Is there any good objection to the mode of the arbitration? It ſeems impoſſible, that any one more fair or convenient could have been deviſed, and it is recommended by its analogy to what is common among individuals.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="267" facs="unknown:028389_0266_0FD8E99A171B6F90"/>
What the mode is, has been already detailed, and need not be repeated here. It is objected, that too much has been left to chance; but no ſubſtitute has been offered, which would have been attended with leſs caſualty. The fact is, that none ſuch can be offere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.—Conſcious of this, thoſe who make the objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have not thought fit to give an opportunity of compariſon by propoſing a ſubſtitute. What is left to chance? Not that there ſhall be a final deciſion; for this is moſt effectually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for. It is not only poſitively ſtipulated that commiſſioners, with full and definitive power, ſhall be appointed, but an ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate choice is ſecured, by reſerring, in the laſt reſort, to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion <hi>by lot,</hi> what it might not be practicable to decide by agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This is the <hi>ne plus ultra</hi> of precaution. Is it that this reference to lot leaves it too uncertain of what character or diſpoſition the third commiſſioner may be? If this be not rather a recommendation of the fairneſs of the plan, how was it to remedied? Could it have been expected of either of the parties, to leave the nomination to the other? Certainly not. Would it have been adviſable to have referred the ultimate choice to ſome other ſtate or government? Where would one have been found, in the opinion of both parties, ſufficiently impártial? On which ſide would there have been the greateſt danger of a ſucceſsful employment of undue influence? Is it not evident, that this expedient would have added to equal uncertainty, as to character and diſpoſition, other caſualties and more delay? Should it have been left to the two commiſſioners, appointed by the parties to agree at all events? It might have been impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for them to come to an agreement, and then the whole plan of ſettlement would have been fruſtrated. Would the ſword have been a more certain arbiter? Of all uncertain things, the iſſues of war are the moſt uncertain. What do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections of this kind prove, but that there are perſons reſolved to object at all events?</p>
                     <p>The ſubmiſſion of this queſtion to arbitration has been repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as an eventual diſmemberment of empire, which, it has been ſaid, cannot rightly be agreed to, but in a caſe of extreme neceſſity. This rule of extreme neceſſity is manifeſtly only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to a ceſſion or relinquiſhment of a part of a country, held by a clear and acknowledged title; not to a caſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted boundary.</p>
                     <p>It would be a horrid and deſtructive principle, that nations could not terminate a diſpute about the title to a particular par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of territory, by amicable agreement, or by ſubmiſſion to arbitration as its ſubſtitute; but would be under an indiſpenſible obligation to proſecute the diſpute by arms, till real danger to
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:028389_0267_0FD8E99A19793D80"/>the exiſtence of one of the parties ſhould juſtify, by the plea of extreme neceſſity, a ſurrender of its pretenſions.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, the terms in which writers lay down the rule, and the reaſon of it, will inſtruct us that where it does apply, it relates not to territory as ſuch, but to thoſe who inhabit it, on the principle that the ſocial compact entitles all the members of the ſociety to be protected and maintained by the common ſtrength in their rights and relations as members. It is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that the territory between the two rivers in diſpute, is either uninhabited, or inhabited only by ſettlers under the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh. If this be ſo, it obviates all ſhadow of difficulty on our ſide. But be it as it may, it would be an abuſe of the rule, to oppoſe it to the amicable adjuſtment of an ancient controverſy, about the title to a particular tract of country, depending on a queſtion of fact, whether this or that river be the one truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by former treaties between the parties. The queſtion is not, in this caſe, ſhall we cede a part of our country to another power? It is this—To whom does this tract of country truly belong? Should the weight of evidence be on the Britiſh ſide, our faith, pledged by the treaty, would demand from us an acquieſcence in their claim. Not being able to agree in opinion on this point, it was moſt equitable and moſt agreeable to good faith to ſubmit it to an impartial arbitration.</p>
                     <p>It has been aſked, among other things, whether the United States were competent to the adjuſtment of the matters with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſpecial conſent of the ſtate of Maſſachuſetts. Reſerving a more particular ſolution of this queſtion to a ſeparate diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the conſtitutionality of the treaty, I ſhall content myſelf with remarking here, that our treaty of peace with Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, by ſettling the boundaries of the United States without the ſpecific conſent or authority of any ſtate, aſſumes the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that the government of the United States was of itſelf competent to the regulation of boundary with foreign powers— that the actual government of the Union has even more plenary authority with regard to treaties, than was poſſeſſed under the confederation, and that acts, both of the former and of the preſent government, preſuppoſe the competency of the national authority to decide the queſtion in the very inſtance under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. I am informed, alſo, that the ſtate of Maſſachuſetts has, by repeated acts, manifeſted a correſponding ſenſe on the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>A reflection not unimportant occurs here. It was perhaps, in another ſenſe than has been hitherto noticed, a point of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in both governments to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>To a man who has a due ſenſe of the ſacred obligation of a juſt debt, a proper conception of the pernicious influence of laws which infringe the rights of creditors, upon morals, upon the general ſecurity of property, upon public as well as private credit, upon the ſpirit and principles of good government; who has an adequate idea of the ſanctity of the national faith, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly pledged—of the ignominy attendant upon a violation of it in ſo delicate a particular as that of private pecuniary contracts—of the evil tendency of a precedent of this kind to the political and commercial intereſts of the nation generally—every law which has exiſted in this country, interfering with the recovery of the debts in queſtion, muſt have afforded mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſerious regret and real afflicton. To ſuch a man, it muſt be among the moſt welcome features of the preſent treaty, that it ſtipulates reparation for the injuries which laws of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription may have occaſioned to individuals, and that, as far as is now practicable, it wipes away from the national reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the ſtain which they have caſt upon it.

But of this there can be no danger. The ſpontaneous ſentiments of equity, of a moral and intelligent people, will not fail to ſanction, with their approbation, a meaſure which could not have been reſiſted without inflicting a new wound upon the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The recapitulation of ſome facts will contribute to a right judgment of this part of the treaty.</p>
                     <p>It is an eſtabliſhed principle of the laws of nations, that, on the return of peace between nations which have been at war, a free and undiſturbed courſe ſhall be given to the recovery of private debts on both ſides.<note n="*" place="bottom">Grotius, b. iii, c. xx. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>. xvi.</note> In conformity to this principle, the 4th article of the treaty of peace between the United States and Great Britain, expreſsly ſtipulates, "that creditors on either ſide ſhall meet with no lawful impediment to the recovery of the full value in ſterling money of all bona fide debts theretofore contracted."</p>
                     <p>Two inſtances of the violation of this article have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready noticed, with a view to another point; one relating to certain laws of the ſtate of Virginia, paſſed prior to the peace, which, for ſeveral years after it, appears to have operated to prevent the legal purſuit of their claims by Britiſh creditors. Another, relating to a law of the ſtate of South Carolina, which ſuſpended the recovery of the debts for nine months, and after that period permitted the recovery only in four years inſtalments.</p>
                     <p>But theſe were not all the inſtances; there were other laws of South Carolina prolonging the inſtalments, and obliging the creditors <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Theſe very ſerious and compulſory interferences with the rights of the creditors, have received from Decius, the ſoft appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a modification of the recovery of Britiſh debts. Does he expect to make us believe, by this ſmooth phraſe, that the right to recover the full value of a debt in ſterling money, is ſatisfied by the obligation to take as a ſubſtitute, one half, one third, or one fourth of the real value in paper?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="271" facs="unknown:028389_0270_0FD8E9A3220146C8"/>
It muſt neceſſarily have happened, that Britiſh creditors have ſuſtained, from the operation of the different acts alluded to, loſſes more or leſs extenſive, which the mere removal of the legal impediments which occaſioned them could not repair. In many inſtances, the loſſes muſt have actually accrued and taken their full effect: in others, where no proceedings may have been had, the lapſe of ſo many years muſt have created inabilities to pay, in debtors who were originally competent, who might have been made to pay, had there been a free courſe of juſtice.</p>
                     <p>The removal of the impediments, therefore, by opening of the courts of juſtice, was not an adequate ſatisfaction. It could not ſuperſede the obligation of compenſation for loſſes which had irretrievably accrued by the operation of the legal impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments, while they continued in force. The claim for this was ſtill open on the part of Great Britain, and ſtill to be adjuſted between the two nations.</p>
                     <p>The excuſe, that theſe laws were retaliations for prior in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractions of treaty by Great Britain, was in no view an anſwer to the claim.<note n="†" place="bottom">It may not be improper to obſerve, that this excuſe implies a palpable vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the then conſtitution of the United States. The confederation veſted the powers of war and of treaty in the Union. It therefore lay excluſively with congreſs to pronounce, whether the treaty was or was not violated by Great Britain, and what ſhould be the ſatisfaction. No ſtate, individually, had the leaſt right to meddle with the queſtion, and the having done it was an uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the conſtitutional authority of the United States
<p>It might be ſhown, on a ſimilar principle, that an confiſcations or ſequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Britiſh debts,</hi> by particular ſtates, daring the war, were alſo uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional.</p>
                        </note>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the firſt place, as has already been proved, the fact of ſuch prior infractions was too doubtful to be finally inſiſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and was, after a fruitleſs effort to obtain the acquieſcence of the other party, properly and neceſſarily waved; ſo that it could not ſerve as a plea againſt reparation.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond place, if that fact had been indubitable, the ſpecies of retaliation was unwarantable. It will be ſhown, when we come to diſcuſs the 10th article, that the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the third place, it was eſſential to reciprocity in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtment of the diſputes which had exiſted concerning the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of peace. When we claimed the reinſtatement and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the article with regard to the poſts; it was juſt that we ſhould conſent to the reinſtatement and execution of the article with regard to debts. If the obſtruction of the recovery of debts was the equivalent by way of retaliation for the deten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the poſts, we could not expect to have reſtitution of the thing withheld, and to retain the equivalent for it likewiſe. The dilemma was, to be content with the equivalent, and abandon the thing; or to recover the thing, and abandon the equivalent: to have both was more than we could rightly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend. The reinſtatement of the article, with regard to the debts, neceſſarily included two things, the removal of legal impediments as to the future recovery; compenſation for paſt loſſes by reaſon of thoſe impediments. The firſt had been ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the new conſtitution of the United States; the laſt is promiſed by the treaty.</p>
                     <p>Did our envoy reply, that the reinſtatement of the article with regard to the poſts included likewiſe compenſation for their detention? Was it an anſwer to this, deſtitute of reaſon, that our loſs, by the detention of the poſts, which reſolved itſelf eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially into the uncertain profits of a trade that might have been carried on, admitted of no ſatisfactory rule of computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; while the principal and intereſt of private debts afforded a familiar ſtandard for the computation of loſſes upon them: that, nevertheleſs, while this was the uſual, and muſt be the admitted ſtandard, it is an adequate one in caſes where pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is protracted beyond the allowed term of credit; ſince the mere intereſt of money does not countervail among mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, the profits of its employment in trade, and ſtill leſs the derangements of credit and fortune, which frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult to creditors, from procraſtinations of payment; and that the final damage to Great Britain, in theſe two particulars, for which no proviſion could be made, might well exceed any loſſes to us by the detention of the poſts?</p>
                     <p>In the laſt place, the compenſation ſtipulated was a <hi>fine qua non</hi> with Great Britain, of the ſurrender of the poſts, and the adjuſtment of the controverſy which had ſubſiſted between the two countries. The making it ſuch may be conceived to have been dictated more by the importance of the precedent, than by the quantum of the ſum in queſtion. We ſhall eaſily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this, if we conſider how much the commercial capital of Great Britain is ſpread over the world. The vaſt credits ſhe is in the habit of extending to foreign countries, renders it to
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:028389_0272_0FD8E9A70D400B48"/>her an eſſential point to protect thoſe credits by all the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in her power.—She cannot forbear to contend at every hazard againſt precedents of the invaſion of the rights of her merchants, and for retribution where any happen. Hence it is always to be expected, that ſhe will be peculiarly inflexible on this point: and that nothing ſhort of extreme neceſſity can bring her to relax in an article of policy, which perhaps not leſs than any other, is a neceſſary prop of the whole ſyſtem of her political economy.</p>
                     <p>It was, therefore, to have been foreſeen that whenever our controverſy with Great Britain was adjuſted, compenſation for obſtructions to the recovery of debts would make a part of the adjuſtment. The option lay between compenſation, relinquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the poſts, or war. Our envoy is entitled to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of all good men, for preferring the firſt. The extent of the compenſation can on no poſſible ſcale compare with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe permanent value of the poſts, or with the expenſes of war. The ſphere of the interferences has been too partial to make the ſum of the compenſation, in any event, a very ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous object; and as to a war, a conſcientious or virtuous mind could never endure the thoughts of ſeeing the country involved in its calamities, to get rid of an act of juſtice to individuals, whoſe rights, in contempt of public faith, had been violated.</p>
                     <p>Having reviewed the general conſiderations which juſtify the ſtipulation of compenſation, it will be proper to examine if the plan upon which it is to be made, is unexceptionable.</p>
                     <p>This plan contains the following features,

                     <p>It is confined to debts contracted before the peace, and ſtill owing to the creditors. It embrances only the caſes of loſs or damage in conſequence of legal impediments to the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of thoſe debts which will exclude all caſes of voluntary compromiſe, and can include none, where the laws have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted a free courſe to juſtice.

<pb n="275" facs="unknown:028389_0274_0FD8E9B04A49C618"/>abuſe of authority by the commiſſioners. Should they palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly exceed their commiſſion, or abuſe their truſt, the United States may juſtifiably, though at their peril, refuſe compliance. For example, if they ſhould undertake to award upon a debt contracted ſince the peace, there could be no doubt that their award would be a nullity. So likewiſe there may be other plain caſes of miſconduct, which, in honor and conſcience, would exonerate the United States from performance. It is only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon them to act, <hi>bona fide,</hi> and as they act at their peril, to examine well the ſoundneſs of the ground on which they proceed.</p>
                     <p>With regard to the reference to commiſſioners to ſettle the quantum of the compenſation to be made, this courſe was dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by the nature of the caſe. The tribunals of neither coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try were competent to a retroſpective adjuſtment of loſſes and damages, in many caſes which might require it. It is for this very reaſon of the incompetency of the ordinary tribunals to do complete juſtice, that a ſpecial ſtipulation of compenſation, and a ſpecial mode of obtaining it, became neceſſary. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting a tribunal to liquidate the quantum of reparation, in the caſe of a breach of treaty, it was natural and juſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe one likely to be more certainly impartial than the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed courts of either party. Without impeaching the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of thoſe courts, it was morally impoſſible that they ſhould not feel a bias towards the nation to which they belonged, and for that very reaſon they were unfit arbitrators. In the caſe of the ſpoliations of our property, we ſhould undoubtedly have been unwilling to leave the adjuſtment in the laſt reſort to the Britiſh courts; and by parity of reaſon, they could not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to refer the liquidation of compenſation in the caſe of the debts to our courts. To have preſſed this would have been to weaken our argument for a different courſe in regard to the ſpoliations. We ſhould have been puzzled to find a ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial principle of diſcrimination.</p>
                     <p>If a ſpecial and extraordinary tribunal was to be conſtituted, it was impracticable to contrive a more fair and equitable plan for it than that which has been adopted. The remarks on the mode of determining the queſtion reſpecting the river St. Croix, apply in full force here, and would render a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar comment ſuperfluous.</p>
                     <p>To the objection of the Charleſton committee, that the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle erects a tribunal unknown to our conſtitution, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to commiſſioners the cognizance of matters appertaining to American courts and juries, the anſwer is ſimple and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive. The tribunals eſtabliſhed by the conſtitution do not
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:028389_0275_0FD8E9B20E2DCA90"/>contemplate a caſe between nation and nation ariſing upon a breach of treaty, and are inadequate to the cognizance of it.— Could either of them hold plea of a ſuit of Great Britain plaintiff, againſt the United States, defendant? The caſe, therefore, required the erection or conſtitution of a new tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal; and it was moſt likely to promote equity to paſs by the courts of both the parties.</p>
                     <p>The ſame principle contradicts the poſition, that there has been any transfer of juriſdiction from American courts and juries to commiſſioners. It is a queſtion not between individual and individual, or between our government and individuals, but between our government and the Britiſh government; of courſe, one in which our courts and juries have no juriſdiction. There was a neceſſity for an extraordinary tribunal to ſupply the defect of ordinary juriſdiction; and ſo far is the article from making the transfer imputed to it, that it expreſsly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts the caſes in which effectual relief can be obtained in the ordinary courſe of juſtice.</p>
                     <p>Nations acknowledging no common judge on earth, when they are willing to ſubmit the queſtion between them to a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial deciſion, muſt of neceſſity conſtitute a ſpecial tribunal for the purpoſe. The mode by commiſſioners, as being the moſt unexceptionable, has been repeatedly adopted.</p>
                     <p>I proceed to reply to ſome other objections which have been made againſt the proviſion contained in this article.</p>
                     <p>It is charged with affixing a ſtigma on the national character, by providing reparation for an infraction, which, if it ever did exiſt, has been done away, there being now a free courſe to the recovery of Britiſh debts in the courts of the United States.</p>
                     <p>An anſwer to this objection has been anticipated by ſome obſervations heretofore made. The giving a free courſe to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in favor of Britiſh creditors, which has been effected by the new conſtitution of the United States, though it obviates the future operation of legal impediment, does not retroſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively repair the loſſes and damages which may have reſulted from their paſt operation. In this reſpect, the effects continued, and reparation was due. To promiſe it, could fix no ſtigma on our national character. That was done by the acts which cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the cauſe for reparation. To make it, was as far as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to remove the ſtigma.</p>
                     <p>It has been ſaid, that the promiſe of compenſation produces injuſtice to thoſe ſtates which interpoſed no legal impediments to the recovery of debts, by ſaddling them with a part of the burden ariſing from the de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>quencies of the tranſgreſſing ſtates.
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:028389_0276_0FD8E9B451DA4448"/>But the burden was before aſſumed by the treaty of peace. The article of that treaty, which engaged that there ſhould be no lawful impediments to the recovery of debts, was a guarantee by the United States of juſtice to the Britiſh creditors. It charged them with the duty of taking care that there was no legal obſtacle to the recovery of the debts of thoſe creditors, and conſequently with a reſponſibility for any ſuch obſtacle which ſhould happen, and with the obligation of making repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for it. We muſt, therefore, refer to the treaty of peace, not to the laſt treaty, the common charge which has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred by interference in the recovery of Britiſh debts. The latter only carries into execution the promiſe made by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. It may be added that it is a condition of the ſocial compact that the nation at large ſhall make retribution to foreign nations for injuries done to them by its members.</p>
                     <p>It has been obſerved, that Mr. Jefferſon has clearly ſhown, that intereſt in caſes like that of Britiſh debts, is liable, during the period of the war, to equitable abatements and deductions; and that, therefore, the diſcretion given to the commiſſioners on this head ought not to have been as large as it appears in the article.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Jefferſon has, no doubt, offered arguments of real weight to eſtabliſh the poſition that judges and juries have, and exerciſe, a degree of diſcretion in any article of intereſt; and that the circumſtances of our war with Great Britain, afford ſtrong reaſons for abatements of intereſt. But it was foreign to his purpoſe, and accordingly he has not attempted to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lariſe the rules which ought to govern in the application of this principle to the variety of caſes in which the queſtion may ariſe: and he has himſelf noted that the practice in different ſtates and in different courts, has been attended with great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity. Indeed, admitting the right to abate intereſt under ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial circumſtances, in caſes in which it is the general rule to allow it, the circumſtances of each caſe, are, perhaps, the only true criterion of the propriety of an exception. The particular nature of the contract, the circumſtances under which it was entered into, the relative ſituation of parties, the poſſibility or not of mutual acceſs; theſe and other things would guide and vary the exerciſe of the diſcretion to abate. It was, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, right to leave the commiſſioners, as they are left, in the ſame ſituation with judges and juries:—to act according to the true equity of the ſeveral caſes or of the ſeveral claſſes of caſes.</p>
                     <p>Let it be remembered, that the government of Great Britain has to conſult the intereſts and opinions of its citizens, as well as the government of the United States thoſe of their citizens
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:028389_0277_0FD8BE9655AF8B50"/>The only ſatisfactory courſe which the former could purſue, in reference to its merchants, was to turn over the whole queſtion of intereſt as well as principal, to the commiſſioners. And as this was truly equitable, the government of the United States could make no well-founded oppoſition to it.</p>

Mutually and diſpaſſionately examined, it is impoſſible not to be convinced, that this proviſion is ample, and ought to be ſatisfactory. The courſe of the diſcuſſion will exhibit various proofs of the diſingenuouſneſs of the clamours againſt it; but it will be pertinent to introduce here, one or two ſamples of it.</p>
                     <p>It has been alleged, that while the article preceding, and this article, provide effectually for every demand of Great Britain againſt the United States, the proviſion for this import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and urgent claim of ours is neither explicit nor efficient, nor co-extenſive with the object, nor bears any proportion to the <hi>ſummary method,</hi> adopted for the ſatisfying of Britiſh claims.</p>
                     <p>This ſuggeſtion is every way unfortunate. The plan for ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying our claim, except as to the deſcription of the ſubject which varies with it, is an exact copy of that for making com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation to Britiſh creditors. Whoever will take the pains to compare, will find, that in the leading points, literal conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is ſtudied; and that in others, the proviſions are aſſimilated by direct references; and will diſcover alſo, this important diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction in favor of the efficiency and ſummarineſs of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for our claim—that while the commiſſioners are expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſtricted from awarding payment to Britiſh creditors, to be made ſooner than one year after the exchange of ratifications of the treaty, they are free to award it to be made the very day of their deciſion, for the ſpoliations of our property. As to compenſation for Britiſh property, captured within our limits, or by veſſels originally armed in our ports and not reſtored, which is the only other Britiſh claim that has been provided for, it happens that this, forming a part of the very article we are conſidering, is ſubmitted to the identical mode of relief, which is inſtituted for making ſatisfaction to us.</p>
                     <p>So far, then, is it from being true, that a compariſon of the modes of redreſs provided by the treaty, for the complaints of the reſpective parties, turns to our diſadvantage, that the real ſtate of the caſe exhibits a ſubſtantial ſimilitude, with only one material difference, and that in our favor; and, that a ſtrong argument for the equity of the proviſions on each ſide, is to be drawn from their cloſe reſemblance of each other.</p>
                     <p>The other ſuggeſtion alluded to, and which has been ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsly reiterated, is, that Denmark and Sweden, by purſuing a more ſpirited conduct, had obtained better terms than the United States. It is even pretended, that one or both of them had actually received from Great Britain a groſs ſum on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count— in anticipation of an ultimate liquidation.—In my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond number, the erroneouſneſs of the ſuppoſition, that thoſe
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:028389_0279_0FD8E9BE2F883A68"/>powers had obtained more than the United States, was inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated; but the ſubſequent repetition of the idea, more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertly in print, and very openly and confidently in converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, renders expedient an explicit and peremptory denial of the fact. There never has appeared a particle of evidence to ſupport it; and after challenging the aſſerters of it to produce their proof, I aver, that careful enquiry, at ſources of infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, at leaſt as direct and authentic as theirs, has ſatisfied me, that the ſuggeſtion is wholly unfounded, and that at the time of the concluſion of our treaty with Great Britain, both Denmark and Sweden were behind us in the effect of their meaſures for obtaining reparation.</p>
                     <p>What are we to think of attempts like theſe, to dupe and irritate the public mind? Will any prudent citizen ſtill conſent to follow ſuch blind or ſuch treacherous guides?</p>
                     <p>Let us now, under the influence of a calm and candid tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, without which truth eludes our reſearches, by a cloſe ſcrutiny of the proviſion, ſatisfy ourſelves, whether it be not really a reaſonable and proper one. But previous to this it is requiſite to advert to a collateral meaſure, which was alſo a fruit of the miſſion to Great Britain, and which ought to be taken in conjunction with the ſtipulations of this article. I refer to the order of the Britiſh king in council, of the 6th of Auguſt, 1794, by which order, the door before ſhut by lapſe of time, is opened to appeals from the Britiſh Weſt India courts of admiralty, to be brought at any time which ſhall be judged reaſonable by the lords commiſſioners of appeals in prize cauſes. This, of itſelf, was no inconſiderable ſtep towards the redreſs of our grievances; and it may be hoped, that with the aid which the government of the United States has given to faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate appeals, much relief may enſue from this meaſure. It will not be wonderful, if it ſhould comport with the pride and policy of the Britiſh government, by promoting juſtice in their courts, to leave as little as poſſible to be done by the commiſſioners.</p>
                     <p>I proceed now to examine the characteriſtics of the ſupple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary proviſion made by the article, in connection with the objections to it.</p>
                     <p>It admits fully and explicitly the principle, that compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be made for the loſſes and damages ſuſtained by our citizens, by irregular or illegal captures, or condemnations of their veſſels and other property, under colour of authority (which includes governmental orders and inſtructions) or of commiſſions of his Britannic majeſty. It is to be obſerved, that the cauſes of the loſſes and damages are mentioned in the disjunctive, "captors or condemnations;" ſo that damages by
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:028389_0280_0FD8E9C1CF41E240"/>captures, which were not followed by condemnations, are provided for as well as thoſe where condemnations did follow.</p>
                     <p>A cavil has been raiſed on the meaning of the word, colour, which it is pretended, would not reach the caſes deſigned to be embraced; becauſe the ſpoliations complained of, were made, not merely by <hi>colour,</hi> but actually by <hi>virtue</hi> of inſtructions from the Britiſh government.</p>
                     <p>For the very reaſon that this ſubtil and artificial meaning aſcribed to the term, would tend to defeat the manifeſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral intent of the main proviſion of the article, which is plainly to give reparation for irregular or illegal captures or condemnations of American property, contrary to the laws of nations—that meaning muſt be deemed inadmiſſible.</p>
                     <p>But in fact, the expreſſion is the moſt accurate that could have been uſed, to ſignify the real intent of the article. When we ſay, a thing was done by colour of an authority or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, we mean one of three things; that it was done on the pretence of a <hi>ſufficient</hi> authority or commiſſion <hi>not validly</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, or on the pretence of <hi>ſuch</hi> an authority or commiſſion <hi>validly</hi> imparted but <hi>abuſed</hi> or <hi>miſapplied,</hi> or on the pretence of an <hi>inſufficient</hi> authority or commiſſion, regularly, as to form, imparted and exerciſed. It denotes a defect of rightful and juſt authority, whether emanating from a wrong ſource, or impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly from a right ſource; whereas the phraſe "by virtue of," is moſt properly applicable to the valid exerciſe of a valid authority. But the two phraſes are not unfrequently uſed as ſynonimous. Thus, in a proclamation of the Britiſh king, of the 25th of May, 1792, he, among other things, forbids all his ſubjects, by <hi>virtue</hi> or under <hi>colour</hi> of any foreign commiſſion or letters of repriſals, to diſturb, infeſt, or damage, the ſubjects of France.</p>
                     <p>In whoſe mouths does the article put the expreſſion? In thoſe of citizens of the United States? What muſt they be preſumed to have meant? Clearly this; that by colour of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions or commiſſions of his Britannic majeſty, either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed erroneouſly, or iſſued erroneouſly, as being contrary to the laws of nations; the citizens of the United States had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered loſs and damage by irregular or illegal captures or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnations of their property. W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>t is the ſtandard appealed to, to decide the irregularity or illegality to be redreſſed? Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly the laws of nations. The commiſſioners are to decide "according to the merits of the ſeveral caſes, to juſtice, equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the <hi>laws of nations.</hi>" Wherever theſe laws, as received and practiſed among nations, pronounce a capture or condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of neutral property to have been irregular or illegal, though by colour of an authority or commiſſion of his Britannic ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:028389_0281_0FD8E9C356FF5440"/>it would be the duty of the commiſſioners to award com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation.</p>
                     <p>The criticiſm, however, fails on its own principle, when teſted by the fact. The great ſource of grievance, intended to be redreſſed by the article, proceeded from the inſtruction of the 6th of November, 1793. That inſtruction directs the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of ſhips of war and privateers, to ſtop and detain all ſhips laden with goods, the produce of any colony belonging to France, or carrying proviſions and other ſupplies for the uſe of ſuch colony, and to bring the ſame, with their cargoes, to <hi>legal adjudication</hi> in the Britiſh courts of admiralty. Theſe terms, <hi>"legal adjudication,"</hi> were certainly not equivalent, upon any rational conſtruction to <hi>condemnation.</hi> Adjudication means ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, a judicial deciſion, which might be either to acquit or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn. Yet the Britiſh Weſt India courts of admiralty appear to have generally acted upon the term as ſynonimous with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. In doing this, they may be truly ſaid, even in the ſenſe of the objection, to have acted by colour, only, of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
                     <p>The Britiſh cabinet have diſavowed this conſtruction of the Weſt India courts; and have as we have ſeen, by a ſpecial act of interference, opened a door which was before ſhut to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal of their ſentences, by appeal to the courts in England. We find, alſo, that the term adjudication is uſed in the XVIIth article of our late treaty as ſynonimous, only with judicial deciſion, according to its true import. This, if any thing were wanting, would render it impoſſible for the commiſſioners to refuſe redreſs on the ground of the condemnations, if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe illegal, being warranted by the pretended ſenſe of the words legal adjudication. But in reality, as before obſerved, their commiſſion will be to award compenſation in all caſes, in which they are of opinion, that, according to the eſtabliſhed laws of nations, captures or condemnations were irregular or illegal, however otherwiſe authorized; and this in contempt of the quibbling criticiſm which has been ſo cunningly deviſed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2d, The proviſion under conſideration, obliges the Britiſh government, in all caſes of illegal captures or condemnations, in which adequato compenſation cannot, for whatever reaſon, be actually had in the ordinary courſe of juſtice, to make full and complete compenſation to the claimants, which is to be paid in ſpecie to themſelves, without deduction, at ſuch times and places as ſhall be awarded.</p>
                     <p>They are not ſent for redreſs to the captors, or obliged to take any circuitous courſe for their payment, but are to receive it immediately from the treaſury of Great Britain.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="283" facs="unknown:028389_0282_0FD8E9C58BF5D808"/>
3d, The amount of the compenſation in each caſe is to be ſixed by five commiſſioners, two appointed by the United States, two by Great Britain: the fifth by theſe four, or in caſe of diſagreement, by lot. theſe commiſſioners to meet and act in London.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems impoſſible, as has been obſerved and ſhown in the analogous caſes, to imagine a plan for organizing a tribunal more completely equitable and impartial than this; while it is the exact counterpart of the one which is to decide on the claims of Britiſh creditors. Could it have been believed, that ſo palpable an error could have been impoſed on a town meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the face of ſo plain a proviſion, as to induce it to charge againſt this article, that in a national concern of the United States, redreſs was left to Britiſh courts of admiralty? Yet, ſtrange as it may appear, this did happen even in the truly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened town of Boſton. The juſt pride of that town will not quickly forget, that it has been ſo compromitted.</p>
                     <p>The truth is, that, according to the common uſage of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the courts of admiralty of the belligerent parties are the channels through which the redreſs of injuries to neutrals is ſought. But Great Britain has been brought to agree to refer all the caſes, in which juſtice cannot be obtained through thoſe channels, to an extraordinary tribunal; in other words, to arbitrators mutually appointed.</p>
                     <p>It is here that we find the reparation of the national wrong which we had ſuffered.—In admitting the principle of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation by the government itſelf, in agreeing to an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary tribunal, in the conſtitution of which the parties have an equal voice, to liquidate that compenſation, Great Britain has virtually and effectually acknowledged the injury which had been done to our neutral rights, and has conſented to make ſatisfaction for it. This was an apology in fact, however it may be in form.</p>
                     <p>As it regards our honor, this is an adequate, and the only ſpecies uſual in ſimilar caſes between nations; pecuniary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation is the true reparation in ſuch caſes—governments are not apt to go upon their knees to aſk pardon of other govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments—Great Britain, in the recent inſtance of the diſpute with Spain about Nootka Sound, was glad to accept of a like reparation. It merits remark, incidentally, that the inſtrument, which ſettles this diſpute, expreſsly waves, like our treaty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the merits of the complaints and pretenſions of the reſpective parties. Is our ſituation ſuch as to authoriſe us to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to impoſe humiliating conditions on other nations!</p>
                     <p>It is neceſſary to diſtinguiſh between injuries and inſults, which we are too apt to confound. The ſeizures and ſpolia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:028389_0283_0FD8E9D10D3A6DC8"/>of our property fall moſt truly under the former head. The acts which produced them, embraced all the neutral pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, were not particularly levelled at us, bore no mark of an intention to humble us by any peculiar indignity or outrage.</p>
                     <p>Theſe acts were of June 8th, and of November 6th, 1793. The ſeizure of our veſſels going with proviſions to the demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of France, under the firſt, was put on the double ground of a war extraordinary in its principle,<note n="*" place="bottom">Though this country has viewed the principle of the war favorably, it is certain that Europe generally. the neutral powers not wholly excepted, has viewed it in a different light, ſo that this was not a mere pretence.</note> and of a conſtruction of the laws of nations, which, it was ſaid, permitted that ſeizure; a conſtruction not deſtitute of colour, and apparently ſupported by the authority of Vattel, though, in my opinion, ill founded. It was accompanied alſo by compenſation for what was taken, and other circumſtances, that evinced a deſire to ſmooth the act. The indiſcriminate conſiſcation of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, upon the order of the 6th of November, which was the truly flagrant injury, was certainly unwarranted by that order (and no ſecret one has appeared)—and the matter has been ſo explained by the Britiſh government. It is clear that evils ſuffered under acts ſo circumſtanced, are injuries rather than inſults—and are ſo much the more manageable as to the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and meaſure of redreſs. It would be Quixotiſm to aſſert that we might not honorably accept in ſuch a caſe, the peca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary reparation which has been ſtipulated.</p>
                     <p>But it is alleged, in point of intereſt, it is unſatisfactory— tedious in the proceſs—uncertain in the event; that there ought to have been actual and immediate indemnifications, or at leaſt, a payment upon account.</p>
                     <p>A little calm reflection, will convince us, that neither of the two laſt things was to be expected. There was abſolutely no criterion, either for a full indemnification, or for an advance upon account. The value of the property ſeized and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned (lay out of the caſe, damages upon captures where condemnation had not enſued) was not aſcertained, even to our own government, with any tolerable accuracy. Every well informed man will think it probable, that of this, a proportion was covered French property.—There were, thereſore, no ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate data, upon which our government could demand, or the Britiſh government pay, a determined ſum.—Both governments muſt have acted eſſentiall by gueſs. Ours could not in honor or conſcience have made even an eſtimate but upon evidence. It might have happened, that a ſum which appeared upon the evidence that had been collected, ſufficient, might have proved on further evidence inſufficient. Too little, as well as too much,
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:028389_0284_0FD8E9D2544072C0"/>might have been demanded and paid. But it will perhaps be ſaid, that ſome groſs eſtimate might have been formed; and that of this, ſuch a part might have been advanced upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as was within the narroweſt probable limit, liable to eventual adjuſtment. Let us for a moment ſuppoſe this done— what good end would it have anſwered? How could the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States have diſtributed this money among the ſufferers, till it was aſcertained which of them was truly entitled, and to how much? Is it not evident, that if they had made any diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, before the final and perfect inveſtigation of the right of each claimant, it would be at the riſk of making miſpay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and of being obliged to replace the ſums miſpaid, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps at a loſs to the United States, for the benefit of thoſe who ſhould be found to be better entitled? Would it have been expedient for our government to have incurred this riſk to its conſtituents? And if the money was to be held undiſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted till an inveſtigation of claims was completed, to what purpoſe the haſte about an advance?</p>
                     <p>On the other hand—Is it in this looſe, groſs way, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions tranſact affairs, with each other? Do even individuals make indemnifications to one another, in ſo lumping a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? Could it be expected of Great Britain, that ſhe would pay, till it was fairly aſcertained what was to be paid; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when ſhe had too much cauſe to ſuſpect, that a material proportion of the property claimed, might turn out to be French? Would it have been juſtifiable on our part, to make her compliance with ſuch a demand, the <hi>ſine quo non</hi> of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation and peace? Whoever will believe that ſhe would have complied with ſo humiliating a requiſition, muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that we were in a condition to dictate, and ſhe in a condition to be obliged to receive any terms that we might think fit to preſcribe? The perſon who can believe this, muſt be, in my opinion, under the influence of a defirium, for which there is no cure in the reſources of reaſon and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>If it muſt be admitted, that it was matter of neceſſity, that inveſtigation ſhould precede payment; then I ſee not what more ſummary mode could have been deviſed. Who more capable of proceeding with diſpatch, that arbitrators untram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melled with legal forms; veſted with powers to examine par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and others, on oath, and to command and receive all evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in their own way? Here are all the means of expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion diveſted of every clog.</p>
                     <p>Eighteen months are allowed for preferring claims, but the commiſſioners are at liberty to adjuſt them as faſt as they are preferred.—In every caſe in which it appears to them <hi>bona fide,</hi>
                        <pb n="286" facs="unknown:028389_0285_0FD8E9D9D0F752A0"/>that the ordinary courſe of juſtice is inadequate to relief, they may forthwith proceed to examine and decide. There is no impediment, no cauſe of delay whatever, more than the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a due inveſtigation always requires.</p>
                     <p>The meeting of the commiſſioners at London, was recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the circumſtance that the admiralty courts were likely to concentre there a conſiderable part of the evidence, on which they were to proceed; which upon the whole, might favor diſpatch, as well as more complete juſtice. In many caſes, the deciſions of thoſe courts may come under their review.</p>
                     <p>As to the uncertainty of the event, this, as far as it may be true, was inſeparable from any plan, bottomed on the idea of a previous inveſtigation of claims: and it has been ſhown, that ſome ſuch plan was reaſonable and inetitable.</p>
                     <p>It may alſo be added, that the plan affords a moral certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſubſtantial juſtice, which is all that can rationally be expected in ſimilar affairs; compenſation, where due, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly ſtipulated. A fair and edequate mode of deciding and liquidating it has been ſettled. All the arguments which were adduced to prove the probability of good ſaith, in regard to the poſts, apply equally to this ſubject. The intereſt which every nation has in the preſervation of character, and which the moſt profligate dare not entirely diſregard—the conſideration of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feating the fulfilment of the ſtipulations on our part—the ſize of the object, certainly not of great magnitude—the very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging ſituation for replunging ſuddenly into a new war, in which the preſent war will in every event leave Great Britain. Theſe are reaſons which afford ſolid ground of aſſurances that there will be no evaſion of performance.</p>
                     <p>As to the commiſſioners, two of the five will be of our choice, a third may be ſo likewiſe; but ſhould it prove other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, it will be ſurpriſing if one of the other three, all acting under oath, and having character at ſtake, ſhall not be diſpoſed to do us reaſonable juſtice.</p>
                     <p n="3">3d, While their power is co-extenſive with <hi>all</hi> loſſes and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage; from irregular <hi>or</hi> allegal captures <hi>or</hi> condemnations, their ſentence in each caſe is to be concluſive, and the rules which are to govern it as preſcribed by the article, are the merits of each caſe, juſtice, equity and the law of nations. What greater latitude could have been deſired to be given? What greater latitude could have been given? What elſe in the caſe was there to have been provided for? What is meant by the aſſertion, that the proviſion is not commenſurate with the object?</p>
                     <p>The general and unqualified reference to the laws of nations, diſmiſſes all pretence to ſubſtitute the arditrary regulations of
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:028389_0286_0FD8E9DB581AE9E8"/>Great Britain as rules of deciſion. Her inſtructions or orders, if incompatible with thoſe laws, are nullities.</p>
                     <p>Thus the treaty unfetters the queſtion between us and her, from the commencement of the war, and with her own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, commits them at large to a tribunal to be conſtituted by mutual choice.</p>
                     <p>Will any man of candour and equity ſay, that a better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion ought to have been expected than has been accompliſhed?</p>
                     <p>The alternative was immediate indemnification, by actual payment in whole or in part, without examination of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent or juſtice of claims; or ſuture indemnification, after a due inveſtigation of both in ſome equitable and effectual mode. The firſt was attended with diſſiculties on our ſide, and with ſolid objections on the other ſide. The laſt was therefore the truly reaſonable courſe, and it has been purſued on a very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per plan.—The cauſes of loſs and damage are fully embraced. They are referred to the deciſion of an unexceptionable tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, to be guided by unexceptionable rules, and the indemnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which may be awarded, is to be paid fully, immediately, and without <hi>de tour</hi> by the Britiſh government itſelf. Say ye im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial and enlightened, if all this be not as it ought to have been!</p>

                     <head>No. XIV.</head>
                     <p>THE numerous faults of the 6th article compel me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctantly to make it the ſubject of another number; and the rather, as we ſhall thereby anticipate ſimilar objections, which we ſhould otherwiſe be obliged to notice in ſeveral. The appointment of commiſſioners without the concurrence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs —the aſcertaining their ſalaries by treaty—their aſſumption of a juriſdiction over matters ariſing <hi>under treaties and caſes in which the United States are parties,</hi> in derogation of the rights of the ſupreme court, having been ſhown to violate the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution—it will, I believe, be readily admitted, that no power exiſts in the preſident and ſenate, to appropriate money to the payment of Britiſh debts, unleſs with the concurrence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs; and that the treaty, therefore, is unconſtitutional, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it pledges them abſolutely to do an, act which they may or may not do at their diſcretion. Whether in the exerciſe of this diſcretion, they could conſtitutionally, agree to this article? or whether if they could, it would be juſt or politic? are queſtions that remain to be examined. The right of the preſident and ſenate, to appoint commiſſioners with judiciary powers, has already been diſcuſſed. The right of <hi>congreſs</hi> to eſtabliſh officers by law, is alſo limited. 1ſt, To the preſident and ſenate. 2d, To the courts of law. 3d, To the heads of departments. 4th, To the preſident alone. No power a veſted in them to allow the appointment of any officer by <hi>lot,</hi> and much leſs to admit that his Britannic majeſty ſhould exerciſe the right of appointing judges for the trial of cauſes in which they are themſelves to be the parties. 2. No power exiſts in congreſs, to take from the ſupreme court the right to determine <hi>all</hi> caſes ariſing <hi>under treaties—all</hi> caſes in which the United States are parties. The determination of theſe caſes is not leſs <hi>excluſively</hi> the right of the judiciary, than the making of laws excluſively of congreſs. 3. In examining theſe powers, I find none that enables them to change the rules of evidence—to alter the eſtabliſhed laws of the country, or to authorize courts ſo to do. Theſe rights, therefore, not being given to congreſs, I preſume are exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively inveſted in the ſtate legiſlatures; and, of courſe, I am
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:028389_0291_0FD8E9EAC62D8EE8"/>led to doubt the right that congreſs themſelves have, to empower any five men, to examine the <hi>plaintiff</hi> on oath, and to receive in evidence, written depoſitions, papers, <hi>copies,</hi> or <hi>extracts,</hi> authenticated <hi>in any ſuch way</hi> "as the ſaid commiſſioners ſhall ſee cauſe to require or allow." A right ſo extenſive, ſo liable to abuſe, particularly when accompanied with the power to decide finally and arbitrarily, ſhould, I think, be tolerated in no free ſtare.</p>
                     <p>The juſtice or policy of the aſſumption of the debts of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, by the United States, muſt be determined by a refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the treaty of Paris, and the ſubſequent meaſures of the United States. By the 5th article of that treaty, it was agreed, "That creditors on <hi>either fide</hi> ſhall meet with no <hi>lawful</hi> impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment to the recovery of the full value in ſterling money of all bona fide debts heretofore contracted." It is obſervable, that this article gives the creditors on neither ſide any claim upon the ſtates, but leaves them to proſecute the individual, and the ordinary courts of law to determine their rights. In conſequence of which, ſome debtors have diſcharged all that was due; others have been more negligent.</p>
                     <p>Upon what principle can the Britiſh creditor charge the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, with debts due from delinquent individuals? It is ſaid, that laws were paſſed to reſtrain the payment of debts for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain period—yet whoever will turn to Mr. Jefferſon's letter to Mr. Hammond on this ſubject, will find, that theſe laws in <hi>no one inſtance</hi> have operated to the prejudice of the Britiſh credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; that the right of congreſs to make treaties, under the old confederation, being unlimited, the ſtate courts always conſtrued the treaty as a law which over-ruled ſtate laws—ſo that the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh creditor has had the full effect of the treaty. Mr. Jefferſon's reaſoning was ſo concluſive on this head, that Mr. Hammond, notwithſtanding his rage for writing and the able aid he had at Philadelphia, did not pretend to anſwer his arguments; but, after ſome delay, evaded them by ſaying that he had ſent his letters to England. Lord Grenville alſo (as appears by Mr. Pinckney's letters) was ſo ſtruck with the force of his reaſoning, that inſtead of anſwering it, he commends it in the higheſt terms; nor did it ever meet with a reply, until Camillus took up the gauntlet as the Britiſh champion.—It is true, indeed, that his arguments on this ſubject, partake ſo much of the quibbles of the bar, are ſo inconſiſtent with the ſtile of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing adopted by ſtateſmen, that, probably, Lord Grenville diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to uſe them—With all his ingenuity, he has not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, adduced <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> a Britiſh creditor's being obſtructed by our courts in the recovery of his debts. But, admitting that
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:028389_0292_0FD8E9EBDB858840"/>there had been temporary obſtructions ariſing, either from the ſituation of the country or the breach of treaty on the part of Britain, all that ſhe could poſſibly aſk, was, that theſe obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould be removed. Now it is admitted that this has been done for more than ſix years paſt; ſo that the Britiſh creditor, from that period, at leaſt, has had the full effect of the treaty. Upon what pretence, then, muſt the United States ſtep in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and his debtor? Why muſt the farmer and mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic be charged with the debt of the merchant, and ſtates that owe nothing, that never have made laws of the nature com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of, pay the debts of thoſe that owe much?</p>
                     <p>But ſuppoſing (contrary to the moſt obvious principles of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and juſtice that the United States ſhould be liable to the Britiſh creditors; ſurely it would have been ſufficient to place them in the ſituation of the debtor, and ſubmit themſelves to the rules of law which prevailed in the ſtate where the debt was contracted; theſe are known to be various in the different ſtates—in ſome, for inſtance, land and ſlaves are not liable to be ſold in fee, for debts, nor were ſo when the debt was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted; in ſuch ſtates the debtor being dead, &amp;c. it will be very difficult to get at the property in the hands of the heir. In others, ſuch aſſignments and conveyances may have been made, as to put the recovery out of the creditor's power—In others, laws, limiting the time for the recovery of debts to a ſhort pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod may have barred the demand. All theſe are riſks the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor knew-he was to run, when he made his contracts.—The United States, who were no party to this contract, can cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly not be bound to ſecure the <hi>Britiſh creditor</hi> againſt them, while it leaves them to operate againſt their own citizens. But, what is ſtill worſe, even the rules of law, both in the deciſion and in the admiſſion of evidence, are to be relaxed in favor of Britiſh creditors. What circumſtance, either in the treaty or in reaſon, can convert all theſe common law cauſes into proper ſubjects for courts of equity? What ſhall carry them even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the rules eſtabliſhed in courts of equity, which, like courts of law, are bound by certain known principles—while theſe commiſſioners are to determine, agreeably to their own (perhaps wild and undeterminate) ideas of <hi>equity and juſtice?</hi>

<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028389_0293_0FD8E9ED52FEA008"/>is very extraordinary, that when we complain of an immenſe loſs of property, by the depredations committed upon our trade, <hi>by order</hi> of the Britiſh goverment, and which, of courſe, they are bound to compenſate—that Mr. Jay's treaty ſends us firſt to their courts of admiralty to determine the queſtions of right, which courts muſt neceſſarily determine agreeably to the ſpirit of the very inſtructions we complain of, nor in any caſe apply to his commiſſioners till ſuch admiralty co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rts have decid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it. The Americans muſt go through all the delays, and ſuſtain all the expenſe of ſuits in Britiſh courts, to obtain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs for loffes which the Britiſh government has occaſioned, while the Britiſh creditor is to charge the United States with debts which <hi>they do not owe,</hi> without the expenſe of a ſuit in any court, and under the advantages of having all the forms of law relaxed in his favor.—This is certainly a new ſpecies of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocity, which nothing but the inventive genius of Mr. Jay, ſharpened by the warmeſt attachment to Britain, could have diſcovered. It is a little extraordinary, too, that when this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle was under conſideration, Mr. Jay ſhould not have reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the 4th article of the treaty of Paris was <hi>mutual,</hi> that it related to debts of <hi>either ſide;</hi> yet Mr. Jay has made no ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation for the payment of debts due <hi>to us</hi> from Britiſh cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors.</p>
                     <p>It is true, that they have paſſed no laws to obſtruct the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of them. But it is alſo true, that without ſuch laws their courts of equity have undertaken to prevent their being recovered. And I need only appeal to the treaſurer of this ſtate (New York) to ſhow the amount that has been paid in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of debts due from perſons whoſe eſtates have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited, and which ſuch perſons were liable to pay to their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors: and that, too, in many caſes in which ſuits had actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally been brought in England, and the cauſes ſtopped by their courts. If my memory, ſerves me, affidavits to this purpoſe, from reſpectable merchants of New York, will be found on the files of our houſe of aſſembly. It cannot be denied, that where the ſtate has diſcharged ſuch debts, they are creditors to the amount, and that under the expreſs words of the treaty of Paris, they have a right to recover. Yet Mr. Jay has care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully excluded them from the benefit of this article; ſince he well knew, that the amount of debts due from Britiſh ſubjects to the ſtates and to individuals, exceeded the demands of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh creditors. Is any ſo blind as not to ſee in this article a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of that ſyſtem which forms the ſtrength of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the moſt corrupt principles? A public debt is thought neceſſary to keep the government together; as if go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028389_0294_0FD8E9EECC97B970"/>wanted any ſtrength but that which ſhe derived from the ſenſe the people had of the advantages they derived from it.—New debts are, therefore, to be created under every poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible pretence. New debts will occaſion new taxes—new taxes new officers—and new officers new ſupporters of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at the expenſe of the yeomanry of the country; for it is obſervable, that the public creditors, bank holders, &amp;c. pay no taxes; thoſe burdens are all borne by thoſe who maintain their ſtate, and nothing is left for theſe lordlings to do, but to watch over the ſafety of government, and ſing hoſannas to the higheſt. It was neceſſary to dry up the reſources of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, leſt the irritation occaſioned by Britiſh inſolence, and the confirmation of them by treaty, ſhould at length rouſe the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the people; leſt, being too rich, they ſhould revolt againſt that virtuous ſupporter of our government, the Britiſh nation!</p>
                     <p>It was foreſeen, too, as Camillus acknowledges, that clamours would be excited by the treaty. The Britiſh party might be too weak to ſilence them. It was a refined ſtroke of policy to ſtrengthen their hands by the addition of ſuch merchants as had unſettled accounts in Britain. The aſſumption of theſe debts by the general government, like the aſſumption of the ſtate debts, cannot fail to make many partizans; nothing can be more convenient for the merchant, than that the farmer, the ſhopkeeper, the mechanic, the landholder, ſhould diſcharge the debts he owes, while he is tearing them to pieces for the principal, intereſt, and profit upon that very capital which the ſtate aſſumes. It may be ſaid that this may be recovered againſt him by the ſtate: but every body knows how negligent public bodies are in the recovery of debts—how impoſſible it will be for them to arrange all the little items of evidence on which the creditor recovers before the commiſſioners, eſpecially where he is not conſined to ſtrict legal proof. And at all events, what advantages will not the debtor derive from many years delay? Can we wonder that ſome merchants are found in our cities to advocate a treaty, which enables them to ride on the necks of their fellow citizens! ſhould we not rather be ſurpriſed (when the Britiſh ſubjects are deducted) to find that number ſo very ſmall? is it not at once a proof of their virtue, and the egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vices of the treaty?</p>

                     <p>THE ſeventh article is ſubject, in a conſtitutional view, to all the objections which have been noticed in the 6th. Nothing, therefore, remains but to examine its political cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. The firſt thing that ſtrikes us, is its ſtudied obſcurity, and the extreme ſolicitude of the parties to render Mr. Jeſſerſon obnoxious to the cenſure it might naturally be ſuppoſed to draw after it, by appearing to make it originate in his letter to Mr. Hammond, written at the moment when the irritation occaſioned by the controverſy with Mr. Genet was higheſt, and when it was doubtful whether a rupture with France would not have compelled us, according to the then favorite ſyſtem, to throw ourſelves into the arms of England. This letter, as was natural under theſe circumſtances, carries our conceſſions to Britain, far beyond any thing which the laws of nations will warrant. Theſe only require the reſtorations of veſſels taken in the ports or waters of the neutral nations <hi>if they can be recovered;</hi> every capture under ſuch circumſtances being an inſult to the nation within the juriſdiction of whom ſuch capture was made. They alſo conſider it as an unfriendly act, voluntarily to ſuffer the veſſels of either party to arm themſelves againſt the other; and ſhould any veſſel which had been ſo armed, enter their ports with prizes, it would be ſtrictly conſonant to the laws of nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to order ſuch veſſel to depart <hi>with her prize.</hi>—But no wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that I have met with, gives the neutral nation a right to ſeize a prize, taken on the high ſeas, and to reſtore it to the original owner;—or much leſs, binds them to pay for the prizes ſo taken, which never entered their ports, merely becauſe the veſſel by which it had been captured, had privately, and without the conſent or knowledge of the neutral government, armed in her ports. Mr. Jefferſon's letter declares the preſident's opinion to be, that as by <hi>treaty</hi> with three nations, we are bound to uſe all the <hi>means in our power,</hi> to reſtore veſſels <hi>taken in our ports, waters; or ſeas near our ſhores;</hi> ſo he thought the ſame protection ſhould be extended to the veſſels of Britain, though we had no ſuch treaty with her—that if in any particular caſe, we had forborn or ſhould forbear, for political reaſons, to uſe the means for the reſtoring of ſuch veſſels, he <hi>then</hi> thought we ſhould be bound to make compenſation; but otherwiſe, where we had uſed means, and thoſe means proved ineffectual, as we ſhould not be bound to make reſtoration to the <hi>nations with whom we had treaties</hi>—he gave <hi>no opinion,</hi> that it ought to be done to Great Britain; that the ſame principle ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, even to captures made on the high ſeas, by veſſels armed
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028389_0296_0FD8E9F6E22E9088"/>in our ports, <hi>provided the prizes were brought into our ports.</hi> He concludes, as the reſult of theſe ſentiments, "And hence, you ſee, ſir, that the preſident contemplates reſtitution or compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in caſes <hi>before</hi> the 7th of Auguſt [1793] and after that date, reſtitution, if it <hi>can be effected</hi> by any means in our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er." From this it appears, that though the preſident's opinion was declared as to ſome caſes, yet that as to others he gave <hi>no opinion.</hi> If, then, the article had referred, as ſome have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, to the letter, for a definition of the caſes in which compenſation was to be made, it would be wholly indefinite, and it muſt have been left to the diſcretion of the commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, a majority of whom may be Britiſh ſubjects, to declare the caſes in which the United States ſhall be liable. As it was, however, poſſible that a majority of theſe commiſſioners, had the queſtion been left to be conſtrued by Mr. Jefferſon's letter, would not have extended it to the length Lord Grenville wiſhed, this diſcretion was taken from them; and the caſes, in which the United States ſhould be liable, carried not only far beyond what the preſident had declared to be his opinion, to wit, "The caſe of prizes taken in our waters, which we had uſed <hi>no</hi> means to have reſtored, and prizes taken upon the high ſeas, by veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels armed in our ports, <hi>if brought into our horbours.</hi>" The treaty renders us liable, in every poſſible caſe, whether it was or was not in our power to reſtore the prize; whether it was taken upon the high ſeas, and ſailed to our own or foreign ports. Nor is the letter referred to in any part of the article, in order to define the caſe intended by the article, but merely (if it had any other object than that I have mentioned) to prevent a ſecond inveſtigation of the queſtion, where the engagements contained in the letter had been already fulfilled. This will appear from the preamble, which is always conſidered as a key to the article. "And whereas certain merchants and others, his majeſty's ſubjects, complain, that in the courſe of the war they have ſuſtained loſs and damage by reaſon of the captures of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and merchandize, taken within the limits and juriſdiction of the United States, and brought into the ports of the ſame, <hi>or taken by veſſels originally armed in ports of the United States;</hi> it is agreed that in <hi>all ſuch caſes,</hi> where reſtitution ſhall not have been made, agreeably to the tenor of the letter from Mr. Jefferſon to Mr. Hammond, &amp;c. the complaints of the parties ſhall be referred to the commiſſioners," &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>It is obſervable, that there is not one word in the article, that confines the judgment of the commiſſioners to caſes in which we either connived at the capture, or uſed no means to reſtore the prize; nor to the caſe of prizes, which, after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028389_0297_0FD8E9F7F7CFE338"/>been captured on the high ſeas, came into our ports; but extends the proviſion to <hi>all caſes</hi> of veſſels taken in our waters, provided they ever entered into our ports, notwithſtanding our having been unable to recover them; or wherever taken, if by veſſels armed in our harbours, whether they came into our ports or not. The article contains a complete and ample definition of the caſes intended, ſo that the mention of the letter cannot be deſigned, in any ſort, to limit the ſenſe; it does not even ſay that reſtitution <hi>ſhall be made</hi> agreeably to the tenor of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but "but where reſtoration has not been already made agreeably to the tenor of the letter," then, in <hi>all caſes</hi> of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as deſcribed in the preamble, the commiſſioners ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the amount, and the United States ſhall pay. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the letter was to anſwer the double purpoſe—firſt, of rendering the writer odious, who, Camillus tells us, was Mr. Jay's rival in his further purſuit of power, and to preclude the captors, whoſe prizes had been taken from them agreeably to the tenor of the letter, from a ſecond hearing before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners. Thus, then, Mr. Jay has, without any warrant from his own government, without any equivalent from the Britiſh, without any juſtification drawn from the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, mortgaged the United States for uncertain and immea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable ſums. It was not enough, it ſeems, to relinquiſh our well founded claim, for compenſation for the detention of our poſts—the loſs of our fur trade—the property carried off. It was not enough to charge the yeomanry of the country with the debts of the merchants; but, in addition to this, we muſt pay a very conſiderable part of the havoc that has been made by French privateers on Britiſh property, and this, too, without any real or pretended equivalent, and while our trade was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering under Britiſh depredations. One would really ſuppoſe that the treaſures of the United States were inexhauſtible; that the art of government conſiſted not in relieving the burdens of the people, but in adding to their load, that they might crouch the more before their lordly maſters; that inſtead of ſeeking for the ſupport of government by convincing the people of its influence on their happineſs, the object was to work upon our fears only—to aſſemble a choſen corps of ſtock jobbers about —I had almoſt ſaid the throne—to make new debts, in order to acquire new recruits to this valuable band—to impoſe new taxes, that the uneaſy ſenſations occaſioned thereby, may afford a pretence to armed ſupporters of government to exert their benign influence—to ſtrengthen theſe by innumerable officers, by boards of commiſſioners (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>N. B. As the ſpace allotted for this paper will not admit of my entering upon a new article, I will indulge myſelf in a ſhort note, in order to obſerve, that Camillus having done me the honor to notice ſome of my remarks, it will give me peculiar pleaſure, when I can do it without breaking in upon the courſe of my obſervations on the treaty, to addreſs my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to him in reply to his. For the preſent I confine myſelf to requeſt, that his readers and mine will ſuſpend their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, until an inveſtigation of his law and his facts ſhall enable them to judge of both with ſome degree of preciſion. Genius is with difficulty retained within the limits of either; and as a ſpecimen of the boldneſs with which it ſometimes over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaps both, I will only refer back to one of his late papers. In ſpeaking of the Indian trade, he aſſerts, that ſeven-eighths of their trade, excluſive of the Hudſon Bay territories, is drawn from the north ſide of the lakes; the poſition I maintain, is directly the reverſe. As neither of us will probably think it delicate to balance the teſtimony we have received from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, we muſt recur to other data, to confirm or refute our reſpective aſſertions. Thoſe I ſhall aſſume, are ſo conſonant to known and eſtabliſhed facts, that I think I may rely upon Camillus's candour to admit them. My firſt poſition is, that ſavage nations hunt chiefly for ſubſiſtence, and to procure ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries which they cannot do without; that the proportion of this which each enjoys is much the ſame in the reſpective tribes on either ſide of the lakes; that, therefore, where the greateſt number of ſavages live by the chaſe, the greateſt quantity of furs and peltry will be collected, with this difference, that the Indians that are neareſt the market, will be moſt careful of thoſe they collect; will wear finer, and exchange more; they will alſo have a greater taſte for luxuries, which will ſtimulate their induſtry and increaſe their ardour for the chaſe; that the bleak regions on the north ſide of the lake are more thinly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited than thoſe on the ſouth, where not only the difference of latitude, but the effect of the large bodies of waters in ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening the north-weſt winds, renders the climate much milder, and better fitted for the habitation of thoſe who live a ſavage
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028389_0299_0FD8E9FAE09AD128"/>life. The great trading ſtations are, therefore, all on the <hi>ſouth ſide</hi> of the lakes.</p>
                     <p>But let us, for the preſent, wave all thoſe circumſtances, which are ſo well known to operate upon the relative proportion of ſavages to the territory they inhabit; and let us take the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> of territory as in part the rule by which to determine the number of inhabitants; it will even then be found, that the trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing country of the United States is near four times larger than that of Canada, excluſive of the limits of the Hudſon's Bay company. Camillus profeſſes to be ignorant of the extent of their boundary, which, I muſt own, ſurpriſes me; ſince he aſſures us, that he has made the fur trade an object of enquiry for years back; and more particularly as it appears, from the whole courſe of his writing, that he can command any materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als in the power of Mr. Jay. It is hardly conceivable, that this gentleman, when treating on the ſubject of thoſe limits in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> where every document of this kind could be inſtantly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, would have been ſo extremely negligent, as not to have poſſeſſed himſelf of the ſettlement by the commiſſioners, after the treaty of Utrecht, and the ſtill more extended claim of the company, to which, without doubt, the utmoſt latitude will <hi>now</hi> be allowed. The ſouthern boundary of the Hudſon Bay company, as ſettled by commiſſioners, ſubſequent to the treaty of Utrecht, is the forty-ninth degree of north latitude, in the whole extent, till it meets with the head of Mooſe river, which brings it one third of a degree more ſouth, thence it runs a north-eaſt courſe, nearly parallel with the St. Lawrence river, along the heights that divide the waters which fall into Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's Bay, from thoſe that run into the St. Lawrence. This line runs within twenty miles of the north ſide of the lake of the Woods; ſuppoſing, as the lateſt geographers do, that lake to lie in forty-eight degrees and forty minutes north latitude. If, therefore, a line run from that lake due weſt, ſhould interſect the Miſſiſſippi, or if not, till it interſects a line drawn from the head of that river, due north, till in meets the weſt line ſo drawn from the lake of the Woods, which muſt, in that caſe, be our boundary, it will only leave a ſtrip of country of leſs than 30 miles in extent, to the north; nor will it be much broader on the north of lake Superior. To the weſt of the Miſſiſſippi, the Britiſh have no claim. Should the lake of the Woods lie one half a degree higher, which is very probable, if we judge from moſt maps of that country, our line will overtop that of the Hudſon Bay company. But whether it does or not, the only Indian territory on the north ſide of the lakes, of the leaſt conſequence, is the ſpace ſurrounded by the lakes, and bounded
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028389_0300_0FD8EA02D9BF56D0"/>on the eaſt by the Ottawa river, which empties itſelf at Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treal. The country eaſt of that, I preſume, cannot be frequented by our traders any more than the country eaſt of the Hudſon: And by their deducting both theſe from our account, and placing the Miſſiſſippi four degrees to the weſt of the lake of the Woods, the Britiſh Indian territory will be found (after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting the great lake and ſettled country on both ſides) to be, to that of the United States, as 15 is to 55. As to any terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to the weſt of the Miſſiſſippi, I know of no ground whatever on which it can be claimed by the Britiſh; the weſt and north weſt coaſts of America being actually poſſeſſed by Spain and Ruſſia, who made the firſt diſcoveries there, and not by Britain) even if we ſhould hold ſo abſurd a doctrine, as to ſuppoſe that either one or the other could give a title to that great inland territory. After this ſtatement of facts, if we take into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration the infinitely greater population of the ſouthern than the northern nations, it will not, I believe, be deemed extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant to aſſert, that the Indian trade on our territory is ten times greater than that on the Britiſh ſide of the lakes. How greatly, then, muſt. Camillus have been deceived, even though he has been for years paſt, as he tells us, collecting information on this ſubject? How ſuſpicious ſhould it render him and his readers, when he makes aſſertions relative to matters with which he has taken leſs time to make himſelf acquainted? The limits of this paper will not permit me to travel from his <hi>facts</hi> to his <hi>law,</hi> or to compliment him upon the ingenuity with which he makes a judgment, in the reign of Elizabeth, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary upon an act which paſſed in that of Charles the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, half a century afterwards. It would, perhaps, have been more in point, to have ſhown any one deciſion of Lord Coke, in which a bare implication was ſaid to over-rule an expreſs ſtatute. But an extraordinary defence requires as extraordinary means of defence. As I greatly reſpect the talents of Camillus, I cannot but with ſympathy enter into his feelings, when this raſh undertaking compels him to ſin againſt his better judgment,</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the great happineſs, which reſults from free government, it remains to be regretted by the temperate friends of liberty, that party-ſpirit and party-meaſures are <hi>"conſequential ills which freedom draws."</hi> The people of the United States, enjoying in their ſocial connection, an unequalled portion of <hi>the natural rights of individuals,</hi> have been from that cauſe, peculiarly ſubjected to the operations of party-cauſes and party-ſprings. Local circumſtances, inaccurately appreciated, have contributed to increaſe the evil; and the accidentally une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual courſe of ſome of the firſt advantages, which reſulted from our re-union and reform in 1789, had a ſtrong, though tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary, effect upon large portions of the people, diſpoſing them to ſuſpicions, jealouſies, and fears.</p>
                  <p>At a time, when the United States were under theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and impreſſions, an unexampled conflict aroſe in the old world. Though our remote ſituation has ſaved us from being inveloped in the devouring flame, even the broad Atlantic has not interpoſed a ſufficient diſtance to ſcreen us from the wide and mighty fire, with which Europe is conſumed: and upon this occaſion the zealous agents of more than one nation have been led, by their paſſions and our own, into more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary operations upon our private opinions and our public councils.</p>
                  <p>It has been happy for this country, ſir, that the influence of theſe cauſes has not been extended to your mind. It is a moſt comfortable reflection to conſiderate men of all parties, that you have been actuated by a ſincere deſire of <hi>common good</hi> in our domeſtic operations, and by impartial views in our foreign relations and concerns.</p>
                  <p>It is hoped, that the freedom of theſe preliminary remarks will not give offence to any of our fellow citizens. They are made ſolely from a conviction, that in our free government it is an object of primary importance to be aware of exiſting
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028389_0302_0FD8EA055C65AB28"/>cauſes of prejudice and heat at the moment of intereſting diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtions. It is hoped, ſir, that theſe prefatory obſervations will appear to be pertinent, as they regard your preſent delicate and important relation to the ſubject, which it is propoſed to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine—a relation which attracts to you the undivided ſolicitudes of the American people and of their friends and foes. <hi>May the God, whom we ſerve, fill your mind with the knowledge of what concerns our peace, at this awful moment, when he hath ordained the ſwords of all civilized nations (except this highly favored peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) to be either prepared for defence, or to be moſt deſtructively ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed againſt each other.</hi>

                  <p>In conſidering the treaty, lately concluded between Mr. Jay and Lord Grenville, three queſtions ariſe.</p>

                     <item>I. Whether it is expedient to adopt it, as it was made.</item>
                     <item>II. Whether it is expedient to reject it, without further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors to adjuſt the ſubject matters: and</item>
                     <item>III. Whether it is expedient to purſue further amicable mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, ſatisfactorily and equitably to adjuſt the ſubject matters.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>On the firſt queſtion, the ſenate appear to have been unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in judgment, that <hi>"it was not expedient to adopt the treaty as it was made,"</hi> becauſe two-thirds of that body have adviſed you to procure certain alterations, and the remainder of that body voted for ſome other alterations. Your own ſentiments upon the neceſſity of amendments are unknown, and it is the object of this examination reſpectfully to lay before you ſuch conſiderations, as appear to recommend the employment of this term of ſuſpenſion to procure <hi>all ſuch meliorations of the treaty, as candid and reaſonable inveſtigation ſhall point out.</hi> This contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution to the collection of materials, whereon you will form your ultimate determinations, may prove to be very ſmall. But that reflection ought not to reſtrain well intentioned individuals from contributing their mites to the public ſervice.</p>
                  <p>On the ſecond queſtion, it appears, that the ſenate were alſo unanimous in their judgment, that <hi>"it is not expedient to reject the treaty without further friendly endeavors to adjuſt the ſubject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters."</hi> For the opponents to the act of the ſenate, explicitly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended further amicable negociation of the treaty with Great Britain: and the act itſelf, carried by a reſpectable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority,<note n="*" place="bottom">This majority of two to one, has been conſidered as <hi>a bare majority,</hi> becauſe it was a bare <hi>quorum.</hi>
                     </note> adviſes that mode of procedure.</p>
                  <p>On the third queſtion, ſtated above, the members of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate appear likewiſe to have been unanimous, <hi>"that it is enpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028389_0303_0FD8EA0B70DA4578"/>to purſue further amicable meaſures to adjuſt ſatisfactorily and equitably the ſubject matters of the treaty."</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It has been already obſerved, ſir, that the courſe of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs has not yet unfolded the ſtate of your mind. It is yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, whether the patriotic and reſpectable citizen, who was charged with the buſineſs on the part of the United States, was able to accompliſh all the objects of his inſtructions, conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably with your judgment; and it is alſo unknown, whether he was led, by the courſe of the negociation, to contract for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, <hi>which your inſtructions had not anticipated,</hi> though his general powers may duly include them.</p>
                  <p>Although every member of the ſenate has diſcountenanced the twelfth article, as it now ſtands, yet as it is adviſed that amendments be procured, one remark on a point apparently important will be here offered. Beſides the great deviation from reciprocity in regard to the tonnage of our veſſels and of theirs in the Weſt India trade, <hi>the ſtipulations reſpecting goods are alſo unequal.</hi> In our limited veſſels we may import <hi>only</hi> ſuch articles as can <hi>now</hi> by <hi>the Britiſh laws</hi> be exported from the Weſt India iſlands. Theſe are about ſix enumerated articles, one of which is rarely exported. But in their ſhips of unlimited ſize they can export all Weſt India articles, which <hi>now</hi> may, by <hi>the laws of the United States,</hi> be imported into this country—that is to ſay, <hi>every thing which is or can be produced by nature, or by cultivation, and every thing manufactured in the Weſt India iſlands.</hi> Whether this was perceived and intended, and, if it was intended, why ſo clear a departure from reciprocity was agreed to, appear, ſir, to be ſit objects of your conſideration.</p>
                  <p>In order accurately to determine the importance of this plain diſcrimination againſt us, it may be uſeful to inſpect the liſt of the commodities, which Britiſh veſſels may import into the United States by their own application of an act of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to this article, and which cannot be imported in our veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels during the exiſtence of the treaty. The principal articles are at preſent as follow: cotton, indigo, limes, lemons, oranges, turtle, dried and ſalted hides, yams, mahogany and other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet woods, lign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> vitae, fuſtic, logwood and other dye woods. As the productions of the Weſt Indies ſhall be varied and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by agricultural enterprize, our privilege will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly narrowed, and their unequal right, under the treaty, extended in proportion.</p>
                  <p>There are parts of the pending treaty, which carry the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of new or extended grants to aliens of the right to hold lands, and which would enable foreigners to receive them by deſcent and purchaſe within the United States. Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028389_0304_0FD8EA0F0CE744B8"/>doubts exiſt, whether the formation and eſtabliſhment of the regulations concerning the tenure, acquiſition and deſcent of lands within the ſtates, has been in any, the leaſt degree, committed by the acts of the conventions to the general go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. The raiſing of this queſtion is ſufficient, ſir, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it due conſideration from you, whoſe judgment on the conſtitution is your guide. If it be ſaid, that the paſſages re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to in ſome degree confirm what the ancient law and the treaty of 1783 had been before ſecured to thoſe foreigners, then it may be enquired, whether a preciſe and explicit refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence back to that former ſtate of things would not have been moſt prudent and ſafe. But it will not be diſputed that the preſent treaty goes beyond the rights of the <hi>untenati.</hi> It may be politic to admit foreigners to hold lands, and it may be right to ſecure ſuch as have been conveyed in truſt to diſcharge juſt debts; but if the ſtate legiſlatures have now that power exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, from the entire omiſſion of a grant of it to the general government, it will be queſtioned, whether that part of the treaty can be ratified, without a <hi>retroſpective</hi> amendment of the conſtitution, or the conſent of the legiſlatures of thoſe ſtates, in which any of the lands may lie. If it is urged, that a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer treaty gave all or ſome of theſe privileges to French citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, it may be obſerved, that ſuch doctrine is of a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent date, that it might appear on inveſtigation to be errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that the French treaty was made under the old confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the ſtates, and underwent a different ratification, and was not made under the preſent definite conſtitution. It may prevent uneaſineſs and inconvenience to anticipate, in time for thorough examination, the poſſibility, that the judicial courts might decide againſt the exiſtence of any power in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral government over the tenure, and particularly over the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, and the deſcent of lands within the ſeveral ſtates.</p>

                     <p>THE ſecond object of the ſeventh article, as ſtated in my laſt number, is "compenſation to Britiſh citizens, for captures of their property within the limits and juriſdiction of the United States, or elſewhere, by veſſels originally armed in our ports, <hi>in the caſes in which the captured property having come within our power, there was a neglect to make reſtitution.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>This preciſe view of the thing ſtipulated, is calculated to place the whole ſubject at once before the mind, in its true ſhape; to evince the reaſonableneſs of it, and to diſmiſs the objections which have been made, as being foreign to the real ſtate of the caſe. Theſe objections are, in ſubſtance, that the compenſation promiſed is of great extent and amount; that an enormous expenſe is likely to be incurred; and that it is difficult to prove, that a neutral nation is under an obligation to go the lengths of the ſtipulation.</p>
                     <p>Theſe remarks obviouſly turn upon the ſuppoſition, errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly entertained or diſingenuouſly affected,—that compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be made for <hi>all captures</hi> within our limits or juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or elſewhere, by veſſels originally armed in our ports, where reſtitution has not, in fact, been made. Did the ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtand on this broad baſis, it would be juſtly liable to the criticiſm which has been applied to it.—But the truth is, that its baſic is far more narrow—that inſtead of extending to all thoſe captures, it is confined to the <hi>particular caſes</hi> of them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in which the captured property came, or was, after the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, within our power, ſo as to have admitted of reſtitution by us, but reſtitution was not made, through the <hi>omiſſion</hi> or <hi>neglect</hi> of our government. It does not extend to a ſingle caſe, where the property, if taken within our juriſdiction, was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately carried out of our reach—or where, if taken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our juriſdiction, it was never brought within our reach—or where, if at any time within our reach, due means were employed without ſucceſs to effect reſtitution.</p>
                     <p>It will follow from this, that the caſes within the purview of the article, muſt be very few—for, except with regard to three prizes, made in the firſt inſtance, where ſpecial conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions reſtrained the government from interpoſing, there has been a regular and conſtant effort of the executive, in which our courts have efficaciouſly co-operated, to reſtore prizes made within our juriſdiction, or by veſſels armed in our ports. The
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028389_0306_0FD8EA172151ADA8"/>extent or amount, therefore, of the compenſation to be made, can by no poſſible means be conſiderable.</p>
                     <p>Let us, however, examine if the conſtruction I give to the clauſe be the true one.</p>
                     <p>It is in theſe words:—"It is agreed that in all ſuch caſes where <hi>reſtitution</hi> ſhall not have been made <hi>agreeably</hi> to the tenor of the letter from Mr. Jefferſon to Mr. Hammond, dated Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember 5th, 1793, a copy of which is annexed to this treaty, the complaints of the parties ſhall be and hereby are referred to the commiſſioners to be appointed by virtue of this article, who are hereby authorized and required to proceed in the like manner relative to theſe as to the other caſes committed to them; and the United States undertake to pay to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainants in ſpecie, without deduction, the amount of ſuch ſums as ſhall be awarded to them reſpectively," &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The letter of Mr. Jefferſon, by this reference to it, and its annection to the treaty, is made virtually a part of the treaty. The caſes in which compenſation is promiſed, are expreſsly thoſe in which <hi>reſtitution</hi> has not been made, <hi>agreebly to the tenor of that letter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>An analyſis of the letter will of courſe unfold the caſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It recapitulates an aſſurance before given by a letter of the 7th Auguſt, to the Britiſh miniſter, that meaſures were taken for excluding from further aſylum in our ports, veſſels armed in them to cruiſe on nations with which we were at peace, and for the reſtoration of the prizes the Lovely Laſs, Prince William Henry, and the Jane of Dublin; <hi>and that, ſhould the meaſures of reſtitution fail in their effect, the preſident conſidered it as incumbent on the United States, to make compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the veſſels.</hi> Theſe veſſels had been captured by French privateers, originally armed in our ports, and had been after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>brought within our ports.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. It ſtates, that we are bound by our treaties with three of the belligerent nations,<note n="*" place="bottom">France, Holland, and Pruſſia, and our treaty with Sweden includes a like proviſo.</note> by all the means in our power, to protect and defend their veſſels and effects in our ports or waters, or on the ſeas near our ſhore, and to recover and reſtore the ſame to the right owners, when taken from them; adding, that <hi>if all the means in our power are uſed,</hi> and fail in their effect, we are <hi>not bound</hi> by our treaties to make compenſation. It further ſtates, that though we have no ſimilar treaty with Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, it was the opinion of the preſident, that we ſhould uſe
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:028389_0307_0FD8EA1A4D95F378"/>towards that nation the ſame rule which was to govern us with thoſe other nations, and even to extend it to captures made on the high ſeas and <hi>brought into our ports,</hi> if done by veſſels which had been armed within them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It then draws this concluſion, that having, for particular reaſons, <hi>forbore to uſe all means in our power</hi> for the reſtitution of the three veſſels mentioned in the letter of the 7th of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt.—The preſident thought it incumbent upon the United States to make compenſation for them: and though nothing was ſaid in that letter, of other veſſels, taken <hi>under like cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances</hi> and <hi>brought in</hi> after the 5th June, and before the date of that letter, yet when the <hi>ſame forbearance</hi> had taken place, it was his opinion, that <hi>compenſation</hi> would be <hi>equally due.</hi> The caſes, then, here deſcribed, are thoſe in which ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal prizes are made, and <hi>brought into our ports,</hi> prior to the 7th of Auguſt, 1793, and in which we had <hi>forborn to uſe all the means in our power</hi> for reſtitution. Two characters are made eſſential to the caſes in which the compenſation is to be made; one, that the prizes <hi>were brought within our ports</hi>—the other, that we <hi>forbore to uſe all the means in our power</hi> to reſtore them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The letter proceeds to obſerve, that, as to prizes made under the <hi>ſame circumſtances, and brought in</hi> after the date of that letter, the preſident had determined, <hi>that all means in our power ſhould be uſed</hi> for their reſtitution; that if <hi>theſe failed,</hi> as we ſhould not be bound to make compenſation to the other powers, in the analogous caſe, he did <hi>not mean to give an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that it ought to be done to Great Britain.</hi> But ſtill, if any caſe ſhall ariſe, ſubſequent to that date, <hi>the circumſtances of which ſhall place them on a ſimilar ground with thoſe before it,</hi> the preſident would think compenſation incumbent on the United States. The additional caſes of which an expectation of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation is given in this part of the letter, muſt ſtand on <hi>ſimilar ground with thoſe before deſcribed</hi>—that is, they muſt be characteriſed by the two circumſtances of a <hi>bringing within our ports,</hi> and a <hi>negle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap> to uſe all the means in our power</hi> for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. Every where the idea of compenſation is negatived, where the prizes have not come within our power, or where we have not forborn to uſe the proper means to reſtore them.</p>
                     <p>The reſidue of the letter merely contains ſuggeſtions for giving effect to the foregoing aſſurances.</p>
                     <p>This analyſis leaves no doubt that the true conſtruction is ſuch as I have ſtated. Can there be any greater doubt that the expectations given by the preſident, in the firſt inſtance, and which have been only ratified by the treaty, were in themſelves proper, and have been properly ratified?</p>

                     <p>A neutral nation (except as to points to which it is clearly obliged by antecedent treaties) whatever may be its opinion of the juſtice or injuſtice of the war on either ſide, cannot, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out departing from its neutrality, <hi>favor</hi> one of two belli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent parties more than the other—<hi>benefit</hi> one, to the <hi>prejudice</hi> of the other—furniſh or permit the furniſhing to either, the inſtruments of acts of hoſtility, or any warlike ſuccour or aid whatever, eſpecially without extending the ſame advantage to the other—cannot ſuffer any force to be exerted, or warlike enterpriſe to be carried on from its territory, by one party againſt the other, or the preparation or organization there, of the means of annoyance; has a right and is bound to prevent acts of hoſtility within its juriſdiction; and, if they happen againſt its will, to reſtore any property which may have been taken in exerciſing them.

                     <p>Every treaty we have made with foreign powers, promiſes protection within our juriſdiction, and the reſtoration of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty taken there. A ſimilar ſtipulation is, indeed, a general formula in treaties, giving an expreſs ſanction to the rule of the laws of nations in this particular.</p>
                     <p>An act of congreſs, of the 5th June, 1794, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly a declaratory act, recogniſes at large the foregoing principles of the laws of nations, providing, among other things, for the puniſhment of any perſon, who, within the United States, fits out and arms, or attempts to fit out and arm, or procures to be fitted out and armed, or is knowingly concerned in furniſhing, fitting out, or arming, of any ſhip or veſſel, with intent to be employed in the ſervice of a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign ſtate, to cruiſe or commit hoſtilities upon the ſubjects or citizens of another foreign ſtate, with which the United States are at peace; or iſſues or delivers a commiſſion for any ſuch ſhip or veſſel, or increaſes or augments, or procures to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed or augmented, or is knowingly concerned in increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or augmenting the force of any ſhip of war, cruiſer, or other armed veſſel, in the ſervice of a foreign ſtate at war with another foreign ſtate, with which the United States are at peace;
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:028389_0309_0FD8EA1D5516AE80"/>or within the territory of the United States, begins or fets on foot, or provides or prepares the means of any military expedition or enterpriſe, to be carried on from thence againſt the dominions of any foreign ſtate, with which the United States are at peace.</p>
                     <p>And our courts have adopted, in its fulleſt latitude, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable, in their opinion, with thoſe laws, the principle of reſtitution of property, when either captured within our juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, or elſewhere, by veſſels armed in our ports. The ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme court of the United States has given to this doctrine, by ſolemn deciſions, the moſt complete and comprehenſive ſanction.</p>
                     <p>It is therefore, undoubtedly, the law of the land, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the proper conſtitutional tribunal, in the laſt reſort, that <hi>reſtitution is due</hi> in the above mentioned caſes.</p>
                     <p>And it is a direct and neceſſary conſequence from this, that where it is not made by reaſon of the neglect of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to uſe the means in its power for the purpoſe; there reſults an obligation to make reparation. For, between nations, as between individuals, wherever there exiſts a perfect obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to do a thing, there is a concomitant obligation to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for omiſſions and neglects.</p>
                     <p>The preſident was therefore moſt ſtrictly juſtifiable, upon principle, in the opinion which he communicated, that, in the caſes of ſuch omiſſions or neglects, compenſation ought to be made. And in point of policy, nothing could be wiſer: for had he not done it, there is the higheſt probability, that war would have enſued.</p>
                     <p>Our treaty with France forbids us expreſsly to permit the privateers of the enemy to arm in our ports, or to bring or ſell there the prizes which they have made upon her. We could not, for that reaſon, have made the privilege of arming in our ports, if it had been allowed to France, reciprocal.—The al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of it to her would, conſequently, have been a clear violation of neutrality, in the double ſenſe of permitting a military aid, and of permitting it to the one, and refuſing it to the other. Had we ſuffered France to equip privateers in our ports, to cruiſe thence upon her enemies, and to bring back and vend there the ſpoils or prizes taken, we ſhould have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by this the moſt miſchievous foe they could have. For, while all our naval reſources might have augmented the force of France, our neutrality, if tolerated, would, in a great degree, have ſheltered and protected her cruiſers. Such a ſtate of things no nation at war could have acqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſced in. And as well to the efficacy of our endeavours to prevent equipments in
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:028389_0310_0FD8EA1E80F56838"/>our ports, as to the proof of the ſincerity of thoſe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, it was eſſential that we ſhould reſtore the prizes which came within our reach, made by veſſels armed in our ports. It is known, that notwithſtanding the utmoſt efforts of the government to prevent it, French privateers have been clan-deſtinely equipped in ſome of our ports, ſubſequent to the aſſurances which were given, that the practice would be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanced. If prizes made by ſuch veſſels were ſuffered to be brought into our ports, and ſold there, this would be not only a very great encouragement to the practice, but it would be impoſſible that it ſhould be regarded in any other light than as a connivance.</p>
                     <p>In ſuch circumſtances, can we blame our chief magiſtrate? Can we even deny him praiſe, for having diverted an imminent danger to our peace, by incurring the reſponſibility of giving an expectation of compenſation? The conjuncture we may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was critical and urgent. Congreſs were at the time in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. A due notice to convene them in ſo extenſive a country, can hardly be rated at leſs than three months.</p>
                     <p>In this ſituation our envoy found the buſineſs. It is not true, in the ſenſe in which it has been advanced, that he was to be governed by the fitneſs of the thing, unmindful of the opinion of the preſident. An opinion of the chief magiſtrate of the union, was to a diplomatic agent an authority and a guide, which he could not juſtifiably have diſregarded.—The claim of compenſation, on the other ſide, was greatly <hi>fortified</hi> by this opinion: Nor was it a matter of indifference to our national delicacy and dignity, that the expectation given by it ſhould be fulfilled. It would have been inde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ent in our envoy to have reſiſted it. It was proper in him, by acceding to it, to refer the matter to the ultimate deciſion of that authority, which, by our conſtitution, is charged with the power of making trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. It was the more proper, becauſe the thing was intrinſically right. Every candid man, every good citizen, will rejoice that the preſident acted as he did in the firſt inſtance—that our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy acted as he did in the ſecond—and that the conduct of both has received the final conſtitutional ſanction.</p>
                     <p>The opinions of Mr. Jefferſon, when they can be turned to the diſcredit of the treaty, are with its adverſaries oracular truths. When they are to ſupport it, they loſe all their weight. The preſumption, that the letter referred to had the concurrence of the judgment of that officer, reſults from a fact, generally underſtood and believed, namely, that the proceedings of the preſident, at the period when it was written, in relation to the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:028389_0311_0FD8EA23E9B86B80"/>war, were conformable with the unanimous advice of the heads of the executive departments.</p>
                     <p>This caſe of Britiſh property captured by privateers origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally armed in our ports, falſifies the aſſertion of the adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the treaty, that the pretenſions of Great Britain have been fully provided for. She had a colourable ground to claim compenſation for <hi>all captures</hi> made by veſſels armed in our ports, whitherſoever carried in, or howſoever diſpoſed of, eſpecially where their equipment had been tolerated by our government. This toleration was to be referred, as well from a forbearance to ſuppreſs thoſe veſſels when they came within power, as from an original permiſſion. Had compenſation been ſtipulated on this ſcale, it is not certain that it would not have amounted to as much more than that which has been promiſed, as would counterbalance our claims, for negroes carried away, and for the detenſion of the poſts. But inſtead of this, it is narrowed down by the treaty to ſuch prizes of thoſe veſſels as were brought within our ports, and in reſpect to which we forbore to uſe all the means in our power for reſtitution. Here, then is a ſet off againſt doubtful and queſtionable claims relinquiſhed on our ſide. Here, alſo, is another proof how much the anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſts of the treaty are in the habit of making random aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But can we wonder at it, when we reflect that they have undertaken to become the inſtructors of their fellow citizens on a ſubject, in the examination of which they unite a very ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial knowledge with the moſt perverſe diſpoſitions?</p>

                     <p>THE eighth article provides merely, that the commiſſioners to be appointed in the three preceding articles, ſhall be paid in ſuch manner as ſhall be agreed between the parties, at the time of the exchange of the ratification of the treaty; and that all other expenſes attending the commiſſions, ſhall be defrayed jointly by the two parties, the ſame being previouſly aſcertained and allowed by a majority of the commiſſioners; and that in caſe of death, ſickneſs, or neceſſary abſence of a commiſſioner, his place ſhall be ſupplied in the ſame manner as he was firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed— the new commiſſioner to take the ſame oath or affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to perform the ſame duties as his predeceſſor.</p>

Could it have been imagined, that even this ſimple and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table proviſion was deſtined not to eſcape uncenſured? As if it was predetermined, that not a ſingle line of the treaty ſhould paſs without the imputation of guilt; nothing leſs than an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction of the conſtitution of the United States has been charged upon this article. It attempts, we are told, a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the public money, unwarranted by and contrary to the conſtitution.—The examination of this wonderful, ſagacious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, with others of a ſimilar complexion, muſt be reſerved for the ſeparate diſcuſſion which has been promiſed of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutionality of the treaty.</p>
                     <p>Let us proceed, for the preſent, to the ninth article.</p>
                     <p>This article agrees, that Britiſh ſubjects, who <hi>now hold</hi> lands in the territories of the United States, and American citizens who <hi>now hold</hi> lands in the dominions of his Britannic majeſty, ſhall continue to hold them, <hi>according to the nature and tenure of their reſpective eſtates and titles therein;</hi> and may grant, ſell, or deviſe the ſame to whom they pleaſe, in like manner as if they were natives;—and that neither they, nor their heirs or aſſigns, <hi>ſo far as may reſpect the ſaid lands,</hi> and the legal reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies incidental thereto, ſhall be <hi>regarded as aliens.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The miſapprehenſion of this article, which was firſt uſhered into public view, in a very incorrect and inſidious ſhape, and was conceived to amount to the grant of an indefinite and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent right to Britiſh ſubjects to hold lands in the United States, did more, it is believed, to excite prejudices againſt the treaty, than any thing that is really contained in it. And yet when truly underſtood, it is found to be nothing more than a confirmation of thoſe rights to lands, which, prior to the treaty, the laws of the ſeveral ſtates allowed Britiſh ſubjects to hold;— with this inconſiderable addition, perhaps, that the heirs and aſſigns of thoſe perſons, <hi>though aliens,</hi> may hold the ſame lands: but no right whatever is given to lands of which our laws did not permit and legalize the acquiſition.</p>
                     <p>Theſe propoſitions will now be elucidated.</p>
                     <p>The term, hold, in the legal code of Great Britain and of theſe ſtates, has the ſame and that a preciſe technical ſenſe—It imports a <hi>capacity legally</hi> and <hi>rightfully</hi> to <hi>have</hi> and <hi>enjoy</hi> real eſtate, and is contradiſtinguiſhed from the mere capacity of <hi>taking</hi> or <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing,</hi> which is ſometimes applicable to the acquiſition of a thing, that is forfeited by the very act of acquiſition. Thus an an alien may <hi>take</hi> real eſtate by <hi>purchaſe,</hi> but he cannot hold it. Holding is ſynonimous with tenure, which, in the feudal ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, implies <hi>fealty,</hi> of which an alien is incapable. Land, therefore, is forfeited to the government, the inſtant it paſſes
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:028389_0313_0FD8EA27AF2AF768"/>to an alien. The Roman law nullifies the contract entirely; ſo that nothing paſſes by the grant of land to an alien: but out law, derived from that of England, permits the land to paſs for the purpoſe of forfeiture to the ſtate. This is not the caſe with regard to <hi>deſcent,</hi> becauſe the ſucceſſion or tranſmiſſion there, being an act of law, and the alien being diſqualified to hold, the law, conſiſtent with itſelf, caſts no eſtate upon him.</p>
                     <p>The following legal authorities, ſelected from an infinite number of ſimilar ones, eſtabliſh the above poſitions, viz. COKE on LITTLETON, page 2, 3.—"Some men have <hi>capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi> to <hi>purchaſe,</hi> but not <hi>ability</hi> to <hi>hold.</hi> Some, <hi>capacity</hi> to <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe</hi> and <hi>ability</hi> to <hi>hold</hi> or <hi>not to hold,</hi> at the election of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others. Some, capacity to <hi>take</hi> and to <hi>hold.</hi> Some, neither capacity to <hi>take</hi> nor to <hi>hold,</hi> And, ſome are ſpecially diſabled to <hi>take</hi> ſome <hi>particular thing.</hi>—If an alien, Chriſtian or Infidel, <hi>purchaſe</hi> houſes, lands, tenements, or hereditaments to him and his heirs, albeit he can have no heirs, yet he is of capacity to <hi>take</hi> a fee ſimple, but <hi>not to hold.</hi>"—The ſame, page 8. "If a man ſeized of land in fee, hath iſſue an alien, he cannot be heir, <hi>propter defectum ſubjectianis.</hi>"—Blackſtone's commentaries, book II. chap. xviii. § 2. "Alienation to an alien is a cauſe of forfeiture to the crown of the lands ſo alien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, not only on account of his <hi>incapacity to hold</hi> them, but likewiſe on account of his preſumption in attempting, by an act of his own, to acquire real property." Idem, chap. xix. § 1. "the caſe of an alien born, is alſo peculiar; for he may <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe</hi> a thing; but, after purchaſe, he can hold nothing, except a leaſe for years of a houſe, for the convenience of merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize."</p>
                     <p>Thus it is evident, that by the laws of England, which it will not be denied, agree in principle with ours, an ALIEN may <hi>take</hi> but cannot <hi>hold</hi> lands.</p>
                     <p>It is equally clear, the laws of both countries agreeing in this particular, that the word <hi>hold,</hi> uſed in the article under conſideration, muſt be underſtood according to thoſe laws, and therefore can only apply to thoſe caſes in which there was a <hi>legal capacity to hold</hi>—in other words, thoſe in which our laws permitted the ſubjects and citizens of the two parties to <hi>hold</hi> lands in the territories of each other. Some of theſe caſes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted prior to the treaty of peace; and where confiſcations had not taken place, there has never been a doubt, that the property was effectually protected by that treaty—Others have ariſen ſince that treaty, under ſpecial ſtatutes of particular ſtates. Whether there are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> others depending on the principles of the common law, need not be enquired into here, ſince the late
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:028389_0314_0FD8EA2890E005C8"/>treaty will neither ſtrengthen nor impair the operation of thoſe principles.</p>
                     <p>Whatever lands, therefore, may have been purchaſed by any Britiſh ſubject, ſince the treaty of peace, which the laws of the ſtate wherein they were purchaſed did not permit him to acquire and hold, are entirely out of the protection of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle under conſideration; the purchaſe will not avail him; the forfeiture, which was incurred by it, is ſtill in full force. 'As to thoſe lands which the laws of a ſtate allowed him to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe and hold, he owes his title to them, not to the treaty.</p>
                     <p>Let us recur to the words of the article, "Britiſh ſubjects, who <hi>now hold</hi> lands, ſhall <hi>continue</hi> to <hi>hold</hi> them <hi>according to the nature and tenure of their reſpective eſtates and titles therein.</hi>" But it has been ſeen, that to <hi>hold</hi> lands is to own them in a legal and competent capacity, and that an alien has no ſuch capacity. The lands, therefore, which, by reaſon of the alienage of a Britiſh ſubject, he could not, prior to the treaty, legally pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe and hold—he cannot, under the treaty, continue to hold. As if it was deſigned to render this concluſion palpable, the proviſion goes on to ſay, "According to the nature and tenure of their reſpective eſtates and titles therein." This is equivalent to ſaying, they ſhall continue to hold as they before held. If they had no valid eſtate or title before, they will of courſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to have none—the expreſſions neither give any new, nor enlarge any old eſtate.</p>
                     <p>The ſucceeding clauſes relate only to deſcents or alienations of the land originally legally holden. Here the diſability of ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enage is taken away from the heirs and aſſigns of the primitive proprietors. While this will conduce to private juſtice, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling the families and friends of the individuals to enjoy their property by deſcent or deviſe, which it is preſumable, was the main object of the proviſion, there is no conſideration of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional policy that weighs againſt it. If we admit the whole force of the argument, which oppoſes the expediency of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting aliens to hold lands (and concerning which I ſhall barely remark here, that it is contrary to the practice of ſeveral of the ſtates, and to a practice from which ſome of them have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto derived material advantages) the extent to which the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is affected by the preſent treaty is too limited to be felt, and in the rapid mutations of property, it will every day dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh. Every alienation of a parcel of the privileged land to a citizen of the United States, will, as to that land, by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the chain, put an end to the future operation of the privilege; and the lapſe of no great number of years may be
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:028389_0315_0FD8EA2D490D1F98"/>expected to make an entire revolution in the property, ſo as to diveſt the whole of the privilege.</p>
                     <p>To manifeſt the unreaſonableneſs of the loud and virulent clamour, which was excited againſt this article, it has been obſerved by the friends of the inſtrument, that our treaty with France not only grants a much larger privilege to the citizens of France, but goes the full length of removing univerſally and perpetually from them the diſability of alieniſm, as to the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erſhip of lands. This poſition has been flatly denied by ſome of the writers on the other ſide. Decius in particular, after taking pains to ſhow that it is erroneous—that the terms "goods moveable and immoveable," in the article of our treaty with France, mean only <hi>chattels</hi> real and perſonal in the ſenſe of our law, and exclude a right to the freehold and inheritance of lands, triumphantly plumes himſelf on the detection of a fallacy of the writer of certain "candid remarks on the treaty," who gives the interpretation above ſtated to that article.</p>
                     <p>The error of Decius's interpretation, proceeds from a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding of the term goods, in the Engliſh tranſlation of the article, to which he annexes the meaning aſſigned to that term in our law, inſtead of reſorting, as he ought to have done, to the French laws for the true meaning of the correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent term <hi>biens,</hi> which is that uſed in the French original. Goods, in our law, no doubt, mean chattel intereſts: but goods or "biens" in the French law, mean all kinds of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, <hi>real</hi> as well as perſonal. It is equivalent to, and derived from, the term <hi>bona,</hi> in the Roman law, anſwering moſt near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>"eſtates"</hi> in our law, and embracing inheritances in land, corporeal and incorporeal hereditaments, as well as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in moveable things.</p>
                     <p>When it is neceſſary to diſtinguiſh one ſpecies from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is done by an adjective—<hi>"biens meublés ét immeublés,"</hi> anſwering to <hi>bona</hi> or <hi>res mobilia,</hi> or <hi>immobilia,</hi> things moveable and immoveable, <hi>eſtates</hi> real and perſonal.—The authorities at foot<note n="*" place="bottom">Juſtinian's Inſtitutes, Lib. iii.

Being a mere word of tranſlation, it muſt be underſtood according to the meaning of the French text; for it is declared in the concluſion of the treaty, that it was originally compoſed and concluded in the French tongue. Moreover, the term <hi>goods,</hi> when uſed in our language, as the equivalent of the term <hi>bon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                     <p>Having now eſtabliſhed the true meaning of the terms "goods moveable and immoveable," let us proceed with this guide to a review of the article.</p>
                     <p>Its firſt and principal feature is, "that the ſubjects and inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the United States, or any of them, ſhall not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted AUBAINS in France. This is the ſame as if it had been ſaid, "they ſhall not be reputed ALIENS." For the definition of AUBAINS, as given in the work before firſt cited, is this— "AUBAINS are perſons not born under the dominion of the king," the exact equivalent of the definition of ALIEN in the Engliſh law. If our citizens are not to be reputed aliens in France, it follows, that they muſt be exempted from alien diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abilities, and muſt have the ſame rights with natives, as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring, conveying, and ſucceeding to real and other eſtate. Accordingly the article, having pronounced that our citizens ſhall not be reputed aliens in France, proceeds to draw certain conſequences. The firſt is, that they ſhall not be ſubject to the <hi>droit d'aubaine.</hi> The <hi>droit d'aubaine</hi> was, under the monarchy, one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>f the regalia; it was the right of the prince to ſucceed to all eſtates or property ſituate in the kingdom, belonging to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, who died without legitimate children, born in the kingdom.</p>
                     <p>It is to be obſerved, that the laws of France permitted fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners to acquire and hold even real eſtates, ſubject to the right of the ſovereign, in caſe of demiſe without iſſue born under his allegiance. But this right of the ſovereign, as to
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:028389_0318_0FD8EA3497E38638"/>American citizens, is abrogated by the treaty; ſo that their legal repreſentatives, wherever born, may ſucceed to all the property, real or perſonal, which they may have acquired in France.</p>
                     <p>And, in conformity to this, it is further declared, that they may, by teſtament, donation, or otherwiſe, diſpoſe of their goods, moveable and immoveable (that is, as we have ſeen, their eſtates, real and perſonal) in favor of ſuch perſons as to them ſhall appear good; ſo that their heirs, ſubjects of the United States, whether reſiding in France or elſewhere, may ſucceed to them, <hi>ab inteſtato,</hi> without being obliged to obtain letters of naturalization.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the ſtipulations on the part of France; and they amount to a removal from the citizens of the United States, of alien diſabilities in that country, as to property. I ſay as to property, becauſe, as to civil and eccleſiaſtical employments, it ſeems to have been a principle of the French law, that the incapacity of foreigners could only be removed by ſpecial diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, directed to the particular object.</p>
                     <p>What are the correlative ſtipulations on the part of the United States? They are in theſe terms, "the ſubjects of the moſt Chriſtian king ſhall enjoy, on their part, in all the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the ſaid ſtates, an <hi>entire</hi> and <hi>perfect reciprocity,</hi> relative to the ſtipulations contained in this article. But it is at the ſame time agreed, that its contents ſhall not affect the laws made, or that may be made hereafter in France, againſt emigrations, which ſhall remain in all their force and vigour; and the United States on their part, or any of them, ſhall be at liberty to enact ſuch laws relative to that matter, as to them ſhall appear proper."</p>
                     <p>Since, then, the article removes from our citizens the diſabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of aliens as to property in France, and ſtipulates for her citizens, an entire and perfect reciprocity in the United States, it follows, that Frenchmen are equally exempt in the United States from the like diſabilities. They may, therefore, hold, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to, and diſpoſe of, real eſtates.</p>
                     <p>It appears that the ſenſe both of the French and of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican government has correſponded with this conſtruction.</p>
                     <p>In the year 1786, the Marquis Bellegarde and the Chevalier Meziere, ſons of the two ſiſters of General Oglethorpe, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Count de Vergennes, the French miniſter for foreign affairs, that they met with impediments to their claims from the laws of Georgia, prohibiting aliens to hold lands. Mr. de Vergennes communicated their complaint to Mr. Jefferſon, our then miniſter in France, obſerving, that the alien diſabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:028389_0319_0FD8EA3A33812670"/>of the complainants having, in common with thoſe of all Frenchmen, been removed by the treaty between the two coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, they ought to experience no impediments on that account, in the ſucceſſion to the eſtate of their uncle, and that the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering laws of Georgia ought to be repealed ſo as to agree with the treaty.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Jefferſon, in reply, ſtates the caſe of the complainants, proving that they were precluded from the ſucceſſion for other reaſons than that of alieniſm; and then adds, that as the treaty with France having placed the ſubjects of France in the United States on a footing with natives, as to conveyances and <hi>deſcents</hi> of property, there is no neceſſity for the aſſemblies to paſs laws on the ſubject, the treaty being a law, as he conceives, ſuperior to thoſe of particular aſſemblies, and repealing them when they ſtand in the way of its operation.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The fixing the true ſenſe of the article in the treaty with Great Britain, is alone a refutation of moſt of the objections which have been made to it, by ſhowing, that they apply not to what really exiſts, but to a quite different thing. It may be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, however, to paſs them briefly in review with ſome curſory remarks.</p>
                     <p>The article, it is ſaid, infringes the rights of the ſtates, and impairs the obligation of private contracts, permits aliens to hold real eſtates againſt the fundamental policy of our laws, and at the hazard of introducing a dangerous foreign influence; is unequal, becauſe no American has been hardy enough, ſince the peace, to purchaſe lands in England, while millions of acres have been purchaſed by Britiſh ſubjects in our country, with knowledge of the riſk—is not warranted by the example of any other treaty we have made; for if even that of France ſhould contain a ſimilar proviſion (which is denied) ſtill the difference of circumſtances would make it an inappoſite precedent; ſince this was a treaty made, <hi>flagrante bello,</hi> in a ſituation which juſtified <hi>ſacrifices.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe objections have been formally and explicitly urged. One writer, afraid of riſking a direct aſſertion, but inſidiouſly endeavoring to inſinuate miſconception, contents himſelf with putting a queſtion. What (ſays he) will be the effect of this article as to the revival of the claims of Britiſh ſubjects, trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors or exiles?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="33" facs="unknown:028389_0320_0FD8EA3D8B06BD18"/>
As to the infraction of the rights of the ſtates, this, it is preſumed, muſt relate to the depriving them of forfeitures of alien property. But as the article gives no right to a Britiſh ſubject to hold any lands which the laws of a ſtate did not previouſly authorize him to hold—it prevents no forfeiture to which he was ſubject by them, and, conſequently, deprives no ſtate of the benefit of any ſuch forfeiture. With regard to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheats for want of qualified heirs, it depended on every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor to avoid them by alienations to citizens.</p>
                     <p>As to impairing the obligation of private contracts, it is difficult to underſtand what is meant. Since land, purchaſed by an alien, paſſes from the former proprietor, and becomes forfeited to the ſtate, can it be afterwards the ſubject of a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid private contract? If the effect of the article was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm a defective title derived from the alien, how could this impair the obligation of any other private contract concerning it? But whatever may be intended, it is enough to ſay, that the article does not confirm the title to any land which was not before good. So that the ground of the objection fails.</p>
                     <p>As to permitting aliens to hold land, contrary to the policy of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ws, it has been ſhown, that, on a true conſtruction, it only applies to the very limited caſe of the alien heirs and aſſigns of perſons who before rightfully held lands, and is confined to the identical lands ſo previouſly holden; that its greateſt effect muſt be inſignificant; and that this effect will continually decreaſe.</p>
                     <p>As to the millions of acres, ſaid to have been purchaſed by Britiſh ſubjects ſince the peace, it has been ſhown, that if by the laws of the ſtates in which the purchaſes were made, they were illegally acquired, they ſtill remain in the ſituation in which they were before the treaty.</p>
                     <p>As to there being no precedent of a ſimilar ſtipulation with any other country, it has been proved, that, with <hi>France,</hi> we have one much broader. The idea, that this was a ſacrifice to the neceſſity of our ſituation, <hi>flagrante bello,</hi> is new. Are we then to underſtand, that we in this inſtance gave to France, as the <hi>price</hi> of her aſſiſtance, a privilege in our country, which leads to the introduction of a foreign influence, dangerous to our independence and proſperity? For to this reſult tends the argument concerning the policy of the excluſion of aliens. Or is it, that no privilege, granted to France, can be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous?</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who are not orthodox enough to adopt this laſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, may, nevertheleſs, tranquillize themſelves about the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences. This is not the channel through which a dangerous
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:028389_0321_0FD8EA3F08750618"/>foreign influence can aſſail us. Notwithſtanding all that has been ſaid, it may, perhaps, bear a ſerious argument, whether the permiſſion to foreigners to hold lands in our country, might not, by the operation of private intereſt, give us more influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon foreign countries, than they will ever acquire upon us, from the holding of thoſe lands. Be this as it may, could we not appeal to ſome <hi>good patriots,</hi> as they ſtile themſelves, by way of eminence, for the truth of the obſervation, that foreign governments have more direct and powerful means of influence than can ever reſult from the right in queſtion?</p>
                     <p>Moreover, there was a peculiar reaſon for the proviſion which has been made in our laſt treaty, not applicable to any treaty with another country. The former relative ſituation of the United States and Great Britain, led to the poſſeſſion of lands by the citizens of each in the reſpective territories. It was natural and juſt to ſecure by treaty their free tranſmiſſion to the heirs and aſſigns of the parties.</p>
                     <p>As to the revival of the claims of traitors or exiles; if pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, <hi>confiſcated</hi> and <hi>taken away,</hi> is property <hi>holden</hi> by thoſe who have been deprived of it, then there may be ground for alarm on this ſcore. How painful is it to behold ſuch groſs at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to deceive a whole people on ſo momentous a queſtion! How afflicting, that impoſture and fraud ſhould be ſo often able to aſſume with ſucceſs the garb of patriotiſm? And that this ſublime virtue ſhould be ſo frequently diſcredited by the uſurpation and abuſe of its name!</p>

                        </date> to know the Sentiments of the Town, upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial Treaty between the United States and the Britiſh Nation, as agreed to by Mr. Jay.<lb/>BENJAMIN BROWN, Eſquire, Moderator.</dateline>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THE ſaid treaty was read—a converſation upon the ſubject took place; and obſervations, obviouſly occurring, were freely and candidly made upon the treaty: And a committee
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:028389_0322_0FD8EA44A59F9780"/>was choſen, to take into conſideration the ſaid treaty, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port thereon at the adjournment.</p>
                  <p>At the meeting, according to adjournment, September 7th, the committee ſubmitted the following draught, as an attempt to expreſs the ſentiments of the town, on the intereſting ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject committed to their conſideration.</p>
                  <p>Claiming it as one among the unalienable rights, for which we have fought and bled, and which we hold dear and ſacred, as freemen, and citizens of a free ſtate, freely, candidly, and firmly, to expreſs our ſentiments upon any public meaſure, which appears intereſting to us, our fellow citizens, ſtate, of nation; and having deliberately attended to, and conſidered, the treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation, between Great Britain and the United States of America, agreed upon and ſigned by the Right Honorable William Wyndham, Baron Grenville, on the one part, and the Honorable John Jay, Eſquire, on the other; and which hath been ratified, with certain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, by the ſenate of the United States.</p>
                  <p>We, the inhabitants of the ſaid town of Lexington, in town meeting aſſembled, unhappily find ourſelves conſtrained to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that, from the general ſentiments and principles of the treaty at large, the moſt natural conſtruction of the ſeveral ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles contained in it, or the meaſures and regulations therein ſtipulated and held up to view, we cannot even flatter ourſelves with the proſpect of thoſe benefits and advantages, political, civil or commercial, which, as free citizens and an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent nation, we had a right to expect, in ſuch a negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as this.</p>
                  <p>That, viewed in compariſon with exiſting treaties of amity and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> merce, between France and the United States, and the United States of Holland and the United States of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, we do not find that fair and perfect reciprocity of privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges and advantages, in the <hi>preſent treaty,</hi> as evidently appears in them. On the contrary, as it appears to us, the ſtipulations of the preſent treaty, in ſeveral inſtances, at leaſt, in their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, muſt tend, directly or indirectly, to deprive us of the benefits and privileges intended to be ſecured to the citizens of the United States, as a neutral nation, by thoſe treaties. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in thoſe articles of the preſent treaty, where proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and other articles, not explicitly contraband of war, by the known and eſtabliſhed law of nations, are made liable to capture and adjudication, the parties making compenſation, as they may ſee fit, as ſpecified in ſaid article. This, as we think, at once throws an important branch of the trade of he United States, as a neutral nation, into the hands and on the mercy of the Britiſh
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:028389_0323_0FD8EA45D6D78CA8"/>government. Beſides, admitting this privilege to the Britiſh, the French and the Dutch may claim the ſame: For, by treaty, they are entitled to the privileges of the moſt ſavored nation. The conſequences are too obvious to need a mention.</p>
                  <p>By the ſecond article, proviſion is made for the delivering up the weſtern poſts, held by the Britiſh within the limits of the United States, after twelve years detention, contrary to expreſs ſtipulation of the treaty of peace, in 1783. And though it is too obvious to need any proof, that the detention of theſe poſts hath been to the great injury of the United States, in the progreſs of their ſettlements and trade with the Indians;— but, above all, in foſtering and encouraging, if not actually ſupporting, a long, expenſive and deſtructive war with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians; yet no proviſion is ſtipulated for any, the leaſt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for thoſe injuries. Neither is there, in any part of the treaty, any proviſion made for compenſation for Negroes, or other property carried off by Britons, contrary to the expreſs prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the treaty of peace between Britain and the United States. Whereas the moſt ample proviſion is made, in the 6th article, for the payment of private debts, to Britiſh ſubjects, contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the peace, out of the public treaſury, with intereſt for the ſame, to the utmoſt farthing. What is the juſtice, what the reciprocity of theſe meaſures and ſtipulations of the treaty, we leave to the principles of equality and common ſenſe to determine. The contraſt is too glaring to need, or even ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of, illuſtration.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame article, it is provided, after the evacuation of ſaid poſts, &amp;c. "That all ſettlers and traders within the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts or juriſdiction of ſaid poſts, ſhall continue to enjoy all their property of every kind, and ſhall be protected therein. They ſhall be at free liberty to remain or remove, to ſell or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. They ſhall not be compelled to become citizens of the United States, or to take an oath of allegiance to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof: But they ſhall be at full liberty to do ſo, if they think proper, and they ſhall make and declare their election, within one year after the evacuation aforeſaid."</p>
                  <p>How far the precincts or juriſdiction of theſe poſts do or may extend, we are yet to learn; but be they greater or leſs, by this article, all who, within the time preſcribed, declare their election to continue Britiſh ſubjects, are at free liberty ſo to do. And thus hundreds, or perhaps thouſands, of Britiſh ſubjects and citizens, with the children of them, to a thouſand generations, may claim an indiſputable right to all the benefits and privileges of natural born ſubjects and citizens, in their perſons, property and eſtate, and yet have no connection with,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:028389_0324_0FD8EA474DACA7F8"/>dependence upon, or obligations to, the government of the land in which they dwell, ſave only for protection. This unlimited indulgence appears to us to be utterly inconſiſtent with all prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of ſound policy, and of moſt dangerous tendency.</p>
                  <p>To ſay nothing of an undue Britiſh influence, on our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal affairs, ariſing from this quarter; the moment a war begins between Britain and the United States, they become, of all men, the moſt dangerous: And whether they continue with us or go from us, they may, and, to prove themſelves faithful to the prince or ſtate of whoſe government they are ſubjects, they muſt, become the moſt injurious; as they will have it in their power to give the beſt information to the enemy, and, as pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, to lead and conduct them where they can injure us moſt, and have the beſt proſpect of ſucceſs againſt us.</p>
                  <p>Of the ſame nature, on the ſame general principles, liable to the ſame objections, and of equally dangerous tendency to the United States, is the 9th article in ſaid treaty. And though there is an appearance of reciprocity, in the ſtipulation, that "Britiſh ſubjects who now hold lands in the territories of the United States, and American citizens who now hold lands in the dominions of the king of Great Britain, ſhall continue to hold them, according to the nature and tenure of their eſtates and titles therein; and may grant, ſell, or deviſe the ſame to whom they pleaſe, in like manner as if they were natives," &amp;c. Yet when it is conſidered, that by well known laws of the Britiſh government, aliens are incapacitated to hold real eſtates, the article appears to be nugatory and deluſive; or even ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this not to be the caſe, this article will, at any rate, be in favor of Britain, and detrimental to the United States, as "The quantity of lauds, held by the citizens of the United States in the Britiſh dominions, will, probably, bear no propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the quantity held by the ſubjects of Britain, in the United States."</p>
                  <p>How far the United States, or the citizens thereof, may avail themſelves of benefit, profit or advantage from the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtipulated for the ſubjects of Britain, the citizens of the United States, and alſo the Indians, freely to paſs and repaſs the boundary line, by land or inland navigation, into the reſpective territories and countries of the two parties, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of trade and commerce, as agreed in the 3d article, we are much in doubt: And from attending to the nature and probable conſequences of ſuch a ſtipulation, are led to ſuppoſe that the inconveniencies attending, and ſacrifices which muſt be made, by acceding to, this agreement, will greatly overbalance every benefit that would be like to accrue to the United States
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:028389_0325_0FD8EA4F235FF438"/>or their citizens: And that under an appearance of reciprocity, the balance would turn greatly in favor of Britain. But be this as it may, it is certain, that by excepting the country with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the limits of the H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dſon's Bay company, the United States are deprived of a great part of the fur trade with the Indians, to which, by local ſituation, they have as good a claim as Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. By this means all reciprocity is deſtroyed, and ſuch an exception appears both ungenerous and unjuſt.</p>
                  <p>Not leſs unequal is the ſtipulation, in the paragraph imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſucceeding, in the ſame article; for all veſſels of the United States are expreſsly excluded admiſſion into any of his Britiſh majeſty's "Sea ports, harbours, bays or creeks, in his ſaid territories, or into ſuch parts of the rivers, in his majeſty's ſaid territories, as are between the mouth thereof and the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ports of entry from the ſea;" barely excepting "ſmall veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels trading <hi>bona fide</hi> between Montreal and Quebec," under certain regulations:—While Britiſh veſſels may claim admiſſion into all ſea-ports, bays, harbours, and even into all rivers, to the higheſt ports of entry for foreign veſſels, in the United States. No comment is neceſſary. The very words of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty itſelf, naturally lead us—with aſtoniſhment, not to ſay, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation—to aſk, What equality—what reciprocity is here!</p>
                  <p>It is added, in the very next ſentence, in this article—"The river Miſſiſſippi ſhall, however, <hi>according to the treaty of peace,</hi> be entirely open to both parties; and it is further agreed, that all the ports and places on its eaſtern ſide, <hi>to which ſoever of the parties belonging,</hi> may freely be reſorted to, and uſed by both parties, in as ample a manner as any of the Atlantic ports or places of the United States, or any of the ports or places of his majeſty, in Great Britain." Upon which we ſhall only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve;</p>
                  <p>That we are utterly at a loſs to account for an idea or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple ſuggeſted, that the ports and places of reſort for veſſels, ſhipping, &amp;c. on the eaſtern ſide of the Miſſiſſippi, may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long either to Britain or the United States, be Britiſh ports, or ports of the United States, promiſcuouſly and indefinitely, as if the land, on the eaſtern ſide of the ſaid Miſſiſſippi, was the property of, and held in common by, both nations: whereas, by the treaty of peace, it is explicitly declared, that the boundary of the territory of the United States, on that quarter, ſhould be "by a line to be drawn along the middle of the ſaid river Miſſiſſippi, until it ſhall interſect the northernmoſt part of the 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſt degree of north latitude."</p>
                  <p>Upon the ſame principles we ſee not but with equal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, Britiſh ports and places of reſort for veſſels, ſhipping,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:028389_0326_0FD8EA504FFC3190"/>&amp;c. might be eſtabliſhed on the weſtern ſide of the <hi>Atlantic</hi> for like purpoſes, on the territory of United States, from <hi>Georgia</hi> to <hi>Nova Scotia;</hi> and with equal advantage, perhaps, to the ſtates and citizens of them. The truth is, while mutual advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, perhaps, might reſult to the citizens and ſubjects of both the contracting nations, by opening their ports to each other, on terms of equality, it is hard to find principles to juſtify the policy, or even ſafety of admitting another nation to eſtabliſh ports and places of reſort, in the manner ſtipulated in this arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, as it appears to us.</p>
                  <p>Whatever "doubt may have ariſen concerning the river truly intended under the name of <hi>the river St. Croix,</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the treaty of peace, as forming a part of the boundary therein deſcribed,"—we cannot feel ſatisfied with the mode of adjuſtment, propoſed in the 5th article of the treaty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To us it appears impolitic, unreaſonable and unjuſt, that the title to ſo great an extent of territory, as is drawn in queſtion by ſaid doubts, ſhould be riſqued on the caſting of a <hi>die,</hi> or the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a <hi>lot.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The treaty profeſſes to have "no reference to the merits of the complaints and pretenſions of the contracting parties;" yet, as we have already obſerved, "thoſe of the Britiſh are fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, while a part only of thoſe of the United States are attended to;" vide and comp. art. 6th and 7th.</p>
                  <p>We are more eſpecially diſſatisfied with this treaty, as, with our fellow citizens in Boſton, we conceive, "that the capture of veſſels and property of the citizens of the United States, during the preſent war, made under the authority of the government of Great Britain, is a national concern; and claims ariſing from ſuch captures ought not to have been ſubmitted to the deciſion of their admiralty courts; as the United States are thereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from having a voice in the final determination of ſuch caſes; and becauſe the indemnification propoſed to be made, is to be ſought by a proceſs tedious and expenſive, in which juſtice may be delayed to an unreaſonable time, and eventually loſt to many of the ſufferers, from their inability to purſue it; and becauſe this mode of indemnification bears no proportion to the ſummary method adopted for the ſatisfaction of Britiſh claims." Vide proceedings at Boſton, article 4th.</p>
                  <p>However diſagreeable to the feelings of a benevolent heart it may, at firſt ſight, appear, to arreſt the property of unoffend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing individuals of foreign nations; yet, in the courſe of events, certain circumſtances may ariſe, in which ſuch property may be the moſt intereſting and effectual pledge for the peace, ſafety, independence, and even exiſtence of a nation. We canno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="40" facs="unknown:028389_0327_0FD8EA51D7B57D10"/>therefore, admit the idea of the neceſſary, juſtice, or policy of the total prohibition of ſuch a meaſure, as we find in the 10th article of the treaty. Nor can we ſuppoſe the ſequeſtration of the debts of individuals, for the common ſafety of a nation, to be any more inconſiſtent with the principles of equity, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutative juſtice, than what every day takes place between contending nations at war, under the ſanction of law and the higheſt authority, in privateering and otherwiſe, in almoſt every act and event of war.</p>
                  <p>The 12th article, in every point of view, appears to us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, degrading, and humiliating to the United States; And although the ſenate have declined to ratify a part of it, yet, as it will remain after the alteration the ſenate hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, it will cut off a very advantageous part of our trade, in the exportation of certain Weſt India articles, from whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever imported, and even ſome articles, the produce of the United States, to any part of the world. Nor are the regulations and reſtrictions on the trade to the Eaſt Indies, leſs degrading and deſtructive, as ſtipulated in the 13th article.</p>
                  <p>The ſucceeding articles relating to commerce, to articles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traband of war, to mutual privileges of veſſels entering the ports of the contracting parties—whether of war or for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and many other matters connected therewith; while, in various reſpects, under the veil of reciprocity, they obviouſly fail of promiſing equal advantages to the United States and their citizens; are, in many important inſtances, as direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traventions of privileges expreſsly ſtipulated, in treaties, in favor of France and the United Provinces of Holland: and cannot fail to operate accordingly.</p>
                  <p>A ſaving clauſe is, indeed, introduced in the 25th article, providing, "that nothing in this treaty contained ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued to operate contrary to former and exiſting treaties, with other ſovereigns or ſtates." How this proviſo can be conſiſtently or ſincerely pretended, we are totally at a loſs to determine; when it is evident, that the greater part of the latter articles, which are temporary, are obviouſly intended to operate in favor of the contracting parties, particularly Britain, in the courſe of the preſent war, as well as afterwards; and of conſequence muſt, in a degree, be ſubverſive of benefits and advantages ſtipulated in favor of France and Holland, in our treaties with them.</p>
                  <p>It is immediately ſubjoined, that "the two parties agree that while they continue in amity with each other, neither of them will in future make any treaty inconſiſtent with this or the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding article." So that whatever advantages with other nations may offer, on theſe points, the United States are totally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:028389_0328_0FD8EA59E4053CB8"/>from availing themſelves thereof, during the exiſtence of this part of the treaty.</p>
                  <p>But what appears moſt of all intereſting and alarming to us, and to the citizens of the United States at large, in the treaty, is yet to be mentioned.</p>
                  <p>It appears to us inconſiſtent with the ſpirit, the principles, and the very letter of the conſtitution of the United States, and, in many inſtances, ſubverſive of them.</p>
                  <p>In ſociety and government, an executive, <hi>be it the ſupreme,</hi> evidently ſuppoſes a legiſlative as at the foundation and above it; and the executive as acting under it, obedient to its laws and directions, and accountable to it.</p>
                  <p>In the ſocial compact, or conſtitution of a nation, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of legiſlation are the firſt and ſupreme powers delegated by the people, who are the ſovereign, and, of right, have and retain the controul of all the powers of government, in ſociety, at pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>All other powers of government, the ſupreme executive, as well as others, are founded in, dependent upon, and grow out of, the legiſlative.</p>
                  <p>All other powers, therefore, <hi>the ſupreme executive not excepted,</hi> are to look up to this, and to realize that they can, <hi>conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally, do no one thing or act,</hi> in the adminiſtration of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but what is founded in the laws actually made by, and conſiſtent with the powers veſted in, the legiſlative. So that, in the preſent caſe, though the conſtitution hath veſted the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and ſenate of the United States, with the general power of <hi>making treaties:</hi> yet this power, at higheſt, is but a ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate power; and whenever aſſumed or carried beyond the laws of the land, or to the ſubverſion or infringement of the powers, by the people in ſocial compact, veſted in the legiſlative, in the formation of treaties; ſuch treaties are ſubverſive of themſelves, and, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> null and void. And this, we humbly conceive, (in a degree at leaſt) is the truth of fact, in the preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                  <p>By the conſtitution, the congreſs, as ſupreme legiſlative of the United States, is veſted with power—"To regulate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with foreign nations, and among the ſeveral ſtates, and with the Indian tribes:"—"To eſtabliſh an uniform rule of naturalization:"—"To lay and collect taxes, duties, impoſts, &amp;c."—"To <hi>deſine</hi> and puniſh piracies and felonies committed on the high ſeas:"—"To make rules concerning captures on land and water:"—To grant and appropriate monies, as it is expreſsly declared, that "no monies ſhall be drawn from the treaſury, but in conſequence of appropriations made by law."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="42" facs="unknown:028389_0329_0FD8EA5ACF2BBE48"/>
Each of theſe powers, veſted by the conſtitution in congreſs, as the ſupreme legiſlative of the United States, appear to us to have been aſſumed, infringed, violated, or ſuperſeded, in various inſtances, by the general principles, particular articles, or ſpecial regulations of the treaty before us.—For ſatisfaction and proof, we beg leave to refer to the following articles, viz. the 2d, 3d, 9th, 12th, 13th, 15th, 17th, and 21ſt, in each of which, one or other of the above mentioned powers, veſted in congreſs, as the ſupreme legiſlative of the United States, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly appears to have been aſſumed, infringed, violated or ſuperſeded, as well as by general principles in the treaty at large.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole—upon the moſt careful attention to, and the moſt mature, diſpaſſionate, and candid conſideration of, the treaty before us, we are of opinion, That it is unequal, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politic and unjuſt; that it is degrading to the dignity of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent nation, and, in its tendency, to the rights, the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, the property, and proſperity of the United States: And that as we have hitherto been, to a great degree, happy and proſperous, without any treaty with Britain ſince the peace, ſo we ſhould much ſooner prefer no treaty of this kind, or even a return to a ſtate of colonization, than the adoption of this.</p>
                  <p>The foregoing report, being read and attentively conſidered, was unanimouſly adopted by the town.</p>
                  <p>Voted, That the proceedings of the town be preſented to his excellency the governor and the honorable the council, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting them to call the general court together, as ſoon as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, to conſider the ſubject of the treaty, and to do or act upon it, as in their great wiſdom they ſhall think meet. Alſo,</p>
                  <p>Voted, That the Reverend Jonas Clark be requeſted to take the charge of the proceedings of the town upon the treaty, and preſent them to his excellency the governor.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>RESOLVED,</hi> That the people of the United States have a right to aſſembled, for the purpoſe of expreſſing their opinion of the conduct of thoſe employed in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the government, and of the tendency of every im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant public meaſure.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Reſolved,</hi> That the people of the different towns in theſe ſtates, who have expreſſed their ſentiments and feelings, in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approbation of the treaty propoſed between the United States and Great Britain, have acted in a manner becoming the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of a free government, and have fully conveyed to the federal executive, the opinion of the merchants and traders on this momentous ſubject.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Reſolved,</hi> That it is the duty of the agricultural part of the union, alſo to expreſs their ſenſe of the probable effects of an inſtrument ſo novel and ſo comprehenſive as the treaty late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſented to the public, as this meeting conceives it embraces moſt of the important relations in which we are placed as ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, or in which we ſtand as connected with foreign na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and becauſe, ſhould it be ratified by the preſident, and ſubmitted to by the people, we ſhould be deprived of many, the moſt important, benefits reſulting from that memorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, which terminated in our independence.—Theſe concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons appear to the members of this meeting, as fair deductions, and ſuch as will inevitably reſult from a ratification of the treaty.</p>

                  <p>"To lay and collect taxes, duties, exciſes and impoſts; to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the ſeveral ſtates, and with the Indian tribes; to eſtabliſh an uniform rule of naturalization; to define and puniſh piracies."</p>

2d, <hi>Becauſe,</hi> The ſecond article authorizes aliens to poſſeſs all the benefits of American citizens, if they ſhould chooſe to become ſuch, and without complying with the rules preſcribed by law; or it eſtabliſhes a Britiſh colony within the limits of the United States, with moſt dangerous privileges, and it gives theſe advantages to men who have been the chief agents in exciting the Indians to a tedious, bloody, and expenſive war; and being our bitter and irreconcilable enemies, they are placed in the moſt favorable ſituation imaginable, to co-operate in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting the moſt deadly and irreparable injuries, at ſome future period, on our weſtern frontiers.</p>
                  <p n="3">3d, <hi>Becauſe,</hi> By the 6th article, compenſation is to be made out of the public revenue, to Britiſh creditors, for loſſes and damages in debts contracted previous to the adoption of the federal conſtitution, although, immediately after its adoption, courts were eſtabliſhed at a great expenſe, whoſe buſineſs has conſiſted in enforcing their collection; and the treaty of peace only ſtipulated that there ſhould be no legal impediment to their recovery; and becauſe by this article, new and unheard of powers are given to a tribunal, whoſe mode of proceeding will be materially different from any heretofore known in America, excluding juries, and attended with the ſingular circumſtance of baniſhing all kind of defence to any claims which may be ſet up, by aſſuming the payment of debts due from individuals: and after thus enticing men to the commiſſion of frauds and perjuries; for any claims they may eſtabliſh before a ſet of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, the majority of whom may be probably of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh nation, payment is to be made out of the treaſury of the United States; by which means a vaſt addition will, undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, be made to the public debt, which is thus to be increaſed at the will of a ſet of commiſſioners, a majority of whom may feel anxious for our political deſtruction; and though this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary conceſſion is made for the ſuppoſed infraction of the treaty of 1783, on the part of America, not the leaſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice is taken of, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="4">4th, <hi>Becauſe,</hi> In the 7th and ſome ſucceeding articles, there is a ſhameful and moſt pernicious direliction of the principle which has been acceded to by many of the powers of Europe, a principle moſt advantageous to the United States, and which

                  <p n="5">5th, <hi>Becauſe,</hi> There is no redreſs given for former injuries, nor even a ſtipulation to prevent a repetition of thoſe injuries, in future, to a moſt uſeful and meritorious claſs of our fellow citizens, the ſeamen, who have been frequently and wantonly ſeized, when engaged in their laborious occupation, torn from their families and deareſt connections, and compelled to ſerve on board Britiſh ſhips of war, to aſſiſt in plundering their countrymen, and in endeavouring to enſlave a nation, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly contributed ſo much to give freedom to this country.</p>

                  <p>And it appears to us, that the treaty ſo entered into, does not correſpond with the objects of this appointment; or that it is calculated to promote the proſperity of the country which made it. On the contrary, it appears, that the envoy loſt ſight of the cauſes which were declared to lead to his appointment,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:028389_0334_0FD8EA67F8B18CC0"/>and to have ſubſcribed to engagements ſuited to the preſent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of England, only.</p>
                  <p>To ſee, and to be convinced of theſe truths, it is only neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to have recourſe to this inſtrument itſelf.</p>
                  <p>The baſis of all national treaties, reciprocity of intereſt, has been laid aſide; and our commerce put under the controul of England.</p>
                  <p>In the Eaſt Indies, it is to exiſt only by her guardianſhip and direction. To the Weſt Indies we may go in ſmall veſſels, until ſhe ſhall ſee cauſe to reconſider the ſtate of her poſſeſſions in that quarter.</p>
                  <p>Her fleets and armies may commit any depredations upon our coaſts and ſea-ports; and no repriſals can take place until a plaintive demand is made, and a tedious negociation gone through, in which ſhe would have time to faſten upon all the ſtrong holds of the union.</p>

                     </gap> of the treaty of peace, in reſpect to the removed negroes, has been relinquiſhed; and compenſation for the ſpoliations complained of, is made to depend on a dilatory proceſs, and the uncertainty of chance: while future captures and detentions are made lawful.</p>
                  <p>The tribunals of juſtice are cenſured in general terms; and made the ground of ſuperſeding their authority by a commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner of chance, which may involve ſome of the ſtates in mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of expenſe.</p>
                  <p>Privateers giving ſecurity in an inconſiderable ſum, will ſcarcely reſtrain them. It will rather be a licenſe for capture, by ſubjecting them to the penalty only, in taking the richeſt veſſels; nor does it appear, that ſuch ſecurity could be availed by an American citizen.</p>
                  <p>Even the exception to the 12th article, has been partially made; for it appears, that the ſenate has approved the whole of the treaty, except ſo much of that article "as reſpects the trade which his majeſty hereby conſents may be carried on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the United States and his iſlands in the Weſt Indies, in the manner and on the terms and conditions therein ſpecified." So that the other part of the ſame article, which prohibits
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:028389_0335_0FD8EA690D088088"/>the exportation of cotton from the United States, is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the exception.</p>
                  <p>This is particularly injurious to this ſtate; for the cultivation of cotton has become, within theſe few years, one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt conveniencies to the citizens; and the improvements in machinery are extending its cultivation. It is light and porta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and is the article moſt conveniently carried to market, to obtain foreign neceſſaries. A prohibition to export it would, therefore, be ſenſibly felt; and may have a direct tendency to diſaffect the minds of the people to the general government.</p>
                  <p>But it is ſaid, that it may be exported in Britiſh bottoms. Admit this, and the injury is increaſed by the addition of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult. To be reſtrained from exporting the produce of our own fields, in our own veſſels, is to ſubmit, not to treat.</p>
                  <p>In fact, if this treaty is ratified, and its ſeveral parts allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to operate, as the ſupreme law of the land, eſſential arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the conſtitution will be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

Having not time to go into a lengthy detail of all the objections to which we think the treaty liable, we have contented ourſelves with ſtating a few on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of thoſe which have moſt forcibly impreſſed themſelves on our feelings, and this ſtatement, put into the form of a report,<note n="*" place="bottom">See Appendix to Mr. Jay's Treaty, page 175.</note> we tranſmit to you, with a full perſuaſion that you will give it that weight and conſideration which the reaſons on which it is founded, may juſtly merit. Confident as we are, that our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low citizens in other parts of the union, impelled by ſenſations ſimilar to our own, and actuated by motives purely patriotic, will, with equal reſpect to your ſtation and to your perſon, come forward with like repreſentations: we conjure you to ſuſpend, for a ſhort time, at leaſt, the ratification of this inſtrument, that the general ſenſe of the community, if they ſhould think proper to expreſs it, may be known on ſo intereſting a meaſure.</p>
                  <p>The pleaſing conviction with which your undeviating con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct has ever inſpired us, of the rectitude of your mind, will not permit us to doubt, but that you will rejoice to avail your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the light which, from every ſource, may be thrown on an

As we are convinced that, in all your public conduct, you have acted and ever will act, with a purity of intention that muſt enſure the approbation of your own conſcience; ſo it is our ardent wiſh, that on all occaſions it may alſo be with that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py conformity to the general ſentiments of your conſtituents, that will preſerve to you, and, if poſſible, increaſe the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal affection which it is your peculiar glory and happineſs to poſſeſs.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE obſerved, with ſincere pleaſure, the ſpirited, firm, and patriotic meaſures of my fellow citizens of this city, in oppoſition to the pending treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation, lately entered into between the United States and the king of Great Britain; an example ſo truly laudable and neceſſary, that, I have no doubt, it will be followed in each of our ſiſter counties.</p>
                  <p>This ſubject has been ſo fully diſcuſſed by abler hands, that I ſhall forbear to enter into a detail of thoſe prominent features of humility and diſgrace to the dignity of the American cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, with which every article abounds. When it was thought neceſſary that an envoy extraordinary ſhould be deputed by the American republic to the court of London, and when the chief juſtice of the United States was inveſted with that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant appointment, we were flattered with the expectation, that he was expreſsly charged to demand of the Britiſh king, an
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:028389_0340_0FD8EA7CABDC1E70"/>unequivocal fulfilment of certain ſtipulations in the treaty of peace, which that monarch had, contrary to good faith, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, and, indeed, refuſed to comply with, and immediate and adequate compenſation for flagrant violations of other ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulations in the ſaid treaty, and for the moſt wanton and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious depredations committed on our citizens, and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, by the Britiſh ſhips of war and privateers, authorized and ſanctioned by the Britiſh cabinet, in direct violation of the law of nations and the rights of neutrality. On any other baſis, a treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation, with that nation, muſt be felt as an inſult to the American people. I have read this pernicious inſtrument with attention, and with a mind, I truſt, favorable to a juſt eſtimate of ſuch advantages as might be derived to us from its adoption; but alas! widely devious from the public hope and expectations, to the American mind it preſents nothing but a diſhonorable ſubmiſſion to our moſt inveterate enemies, inſult and injury to our warmeſt friends and allies, and perhaps makes the firſt inſtance in hiſtory, wherein, after a ſpecial embaſſy for the particular purpoſe, a negociation between two independent nations has terminated by a treaty which contains not even a ſolitary advantage to the party who made the application.</p>
                  <p>The ſpirited reſolutions and addreſs of this city, and ſimilar meaſures in a ſiſter ſtate, while they diſcover a proper reſpect for the government, at the ſame time evince a due attention on the part of the people, to the preſervation of their ineſtimable privileges, and may, perhaps, be a mean of averting the evils which would inevitably reſult from a ratification of the treaty.</p>
                  <p>If happily the preſident ſhould withhold his aſſent to it, there will yet remain this melancholy truth, that the deareſt intereſts of the American people are proſtrated at the foot of a ſingle individual; and, however highly I may think of the virtues of that individual, yet, while human nature is frail, I ſhall conſider the truſt too momentous to be confided even to him. It will then be our duty, as citizens, to enquire, what is the real ſource of this important evil, and by what means a repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it may be avoided. I confeſs myſelf partial to, and a warm admirer of, our conſtitution; but am not blind to its faults; among the greateſt of which is, the power given to the preſident, with the advice of two-thirds of the ſenate, to make treaties with foreign nations, and its declaring ſuch trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to be the ſupreme laws of the land. They ought then, ſurely, to undergo a fair, open, and public diſcuſſion, and be approved of with thoſe legiſlative forms and ſolemnities, which are neceſſary to the paſſing of other acts, before they aſſume
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:028389_0341_0FD8EA810E5D2B78"/>the dignity and efficacy of ſupreme laws. Happily for Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, her conſtitution contains in itſelf a principle by which its errors may be peaceably corrected, whenever the finger of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſhall point them out. An occaſion now preſents itſelf, on which to exerciſe, with ſingular propriety, "that healing principle," the power of amendment, and which it is the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of every good citizen to recommend in the ſtrongeſt terms to the attention of congreſs, and the ſtate legiſlatures. By thus making improvement the reſult of experience, our government will arrive to a degree of perfection unknown in the annals of human inſtitutions. To you, and to my fellow citizens at large, I ſubmit theſe important conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>It will be needleſs for me to reiterate to you the ordinary duties you are now called to perform. Your experience as grand jurors, and your attachment to the public order and tranquillity, ſufficiently aſſure me that your exertions will be properly directed. It is with pain I obſerve a very numerous docket of appeals, ſome of which appear to be of long ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; they will demand, in a particular manner, your pointed at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and I truſt will have it.</p>

                  <p>AFTER a free and liberal communication of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the occaſion, the following reſolutions were agreed to.</p>
                  <p>Reſolved unanimouſly, That it is the duty, as well as the right, of freemen, on all great public occaſions, that concern the honor and welfare of the republic, to come forward and declare their ſentiments, with freedom and firmneſs; to the end that thoſe who are entruſted with power, may be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed to uſe that power, only for the good of the people, who have placed it in their hands, and beware to violate the ſacred truſt.</p>

                     <pb n="55" facs="unknown:028389_0342_0FD8EA82B1054D18"/>
Reſolved unanimouſly, That the aforeſaid treaty ſtrikes us, in every point of light, with aſtoniſhment and indignation. It appears to us mean, ſlaviſh, and obſcure, no wiſe equally binding; but conferring all advantages on the one ſide, and impoſing all reſtraints on the other; degrading to the dignity of an independent republic, and inſulting to the honor and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a brave and free people: And that we think it not only infamous in theſe reſpects, but utterly incompatible with our juſt claims, rights, and intereſts.</p>
                  <p>Reſolved unanimouſly, That Great Britain has always inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riably purſued a policy hoſtile and inſidious to the United States, and that ſhe is now engaged in a war, dangerous to our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence and exiſtence as a nation. Sound policy, therefore, as well as reſentment for paſt and preſent injuries, ſhould pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully perſuade us to ſeize on the moment of her proſtrated ſtrength and humbled ambition, to derive, from the neceſſity of her ſituation, terms, which, in more proſperous circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, we might in vain expect from her juſtice.</p>
                  <p>Reſolved unanimouſly, That the treaty appears to us, in every ſhape, calculated to diſſolve thoſe bands of affection and intereſt, which ought to connect us, in a friendſhip inviolate, with the people of France, a great and regenerated people, who cheriſh, in their utmoſt purity and ardour, thoſe ſacred principles, which have laid the foundation of our freedom, in the blood of our deareſt citizens! The ſympathy of theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, as well as gratitude for paſt friendly and important ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, ſhould unite the two nations together, with a tie that it ſhould be deemed criminal to touch.</p>
                  <p>Reſolved unanimouſly, That greater conceſſions are made, by this treaty, in favor of Great Britain, than America, in any former period, could have been brought to conſent to; and which, in her preſent promiſing condition, ſhe muſt diſdain to think of.</p>
                  <p>Reſolved unanimouſly, That it is the intereſt and duty of all nations to cultivate the bleſſings of peace, and that we depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the calamities and deſolation of war; but that war, with all its horrors, ought much to be preferred to peace, upon ſuch diſgraceful and diſhonorable terms.</p>
                  <p>Reſolved unanimouſly, That we hold in high eſtimation, our fellow citizen Pierce Butler, and the other nine minority mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the ſenate, for their ſteady and patriotic oppoſition to the ſaid treaty.</p>
                  <p>Reſolved unanimouſly, That Jacob Read, and the other nineteen ſupporting members, by their endeavours to ſaddle the United States with the ſaid deteſtable treaty, have ren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>The virtuous ten were for exacting a rigid fulfilment of the treaty of peace; and were for making the compenſation for negroes a part of the preſent treaty; but the heroes of the Gazette of the United States had different views; they wiſhed nothing appended to their darling brat, that ſhould prevent it from receiving the warm embraces of Great Britain, and, therefore, wanted a diſtinct negociation on this ſubject. <hi>Britiſh</hi> creditors are comprehended in the <hi>preſent</hi> treaty; but juſtice to <hi>American</hi> citizens was to be reſerved for future negociations, wholly diſtinct from the treaty of <hi>amity.</hi>

                  <p>O THE Jacobins! Meſſrs. printers, the Jacobins! the Jacobins! What ſhall we do? The whole continent are turning. Jacobins. For all the continent are condemning the <hi>treaty;</hi> and all who do condemn the treaty, are Jacobins. What is to be done? From Georgia to Maine, they act as if the d—l was in them; yet I hope, and truſt, and pray, that there is ſtill a choſen few, who have preſerved themſelves from the contagion of this univerſal mania. Only, Meſſrs printers, only let the people know who they are, that take the lead in theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious tranſactions, and I am ſure they will no longer be influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by them, as I am ſure <hi>they</hi> do <hi>not know</hi> them. I will tell them, I will enlighten their dark underſtandings, I will ſhew the
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:028389_0347_0FD8EA930FFBEF28"/>ſwiniſh multitude" that the ringleaders of this curſed buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, are blinded by partiality and hatred; and that they, ever ſince 1775, have been prejudiced againſt our new, I mean our <hi>old</hi> friends, the Britiſh. To begin then at the fouth; there is that arch rebel, John Rutledge, many years a member of the old continental congreſs, in time of war; what better could be expected from him? is it yet forgotten, that when he was governor of South Carolina, and the Britiſh had poſſeſſion of Charleſton, his capital, that he hung all the Britiſh he could catch; as well as all ſuch as would not aſſiſt him in fighting them? and don't you think he knows, that if the treaty takes place, and the Britiſh again bear rule, that they will hang him in turn; what better then could you expect from ſuch a man as he? Self-preſervation, our parſon ſays, is nature's firſt law: and if he knows, that the Britiſh will hang him if they come, is it not natural for him to try to prevent their coming? 'Tis true, our preſident did make him judge of the ſupreme court of the United States; but he afterwards ſuffered his own ſtate to buy him off, by creating him their chief juſtice with a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſalary. I hope, therefore, the people will not be influenced by the doings of ſuch a man. As for old governor Matthews, his colleague, he is not a farthing better; for don't we all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how the Britiſh ſent him in irons to St. Auguſtine, and kept him ſix months in a dungeon, after Charleſton was taken. Is it not, therefore, natural for him to thirſt for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge? In addition to all this, was be not known, during the whole war, in congreſs, and as governor of Carolina, to be among the moſt inveterate enemies of the Britiſh? to ſuch men, therefore, I hope the people will not truſt; and though they aſſembled a large body of men in Charleſton to oppoſe the treaty, you may depend on it, thoſe men hated the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh, as much as they did, and were all enraged Jacobins.</p>
                  <p>Then, again, there is Norfolk and Porſmouth in Virginia, they too have aſſembled, and expreſſed their abhorrence of the treaty. Now every body knows that, in the late war, thoſe towns were burnt by the Britiſh; is it not, therefore, natural for them to turn Jacobins, and endeavour to keep them out of their country, that they may not have a chance to burn their towns again? but all the world muſt ſee, that this is an unjuſtifiable prejudice, and all the world ought to be above the influence of it. As for Baltimore, has it not been the aſylum of the French; they have an attachment to French principles, becauſe they are favorable to America. It is plain, therefore, as a pike ſtaff, that intereſt governs them, and that they are all Jacobins. Then for Philadelphia, though they have aſſembled in
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:028389_0348_0FD8EA9548A1AFB0"/>thouſands and ten thouſands, to condemn the treaty, yet if you examine the firſt of their committee for drafting reſolutions, your wonder will ſoon ceaſe; at its head you will find that rebel, chief juſtice M'Kean, preſident of the old continental congreſs, aided by a long ſtring of others of the ſame kidney, all ſworn foes to royalty, and inveterate republicans, brooding on the prejudices they imbibed in our war againſt Britain.</p>

                     <p>THE conſtitution of the United States empowers the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, by and with the advice and conſent of the ſenate, to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the ſenate concur.</p>
                     <p>In purſuance of a power thus veſted, the ſenate of the United States did conſent to and adviſe the preſident of the United States, to ratify the treaty of amity, commerce, and naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, between his Britannic majeſty and the United States of America, concluded at London, the 19th of November, A. D. 1794; on condition, that there be added to ſaid treaty an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, whereby it ſhall be agreed to ſuſpend the operation of ſo much of the 12th article, as reſpects the trade which his ſaid majeſty thereby conſents may be carried on between the United States and his iſlands in the Weſt Indies, in the manner, and on the terms and conditions, therein preſcribed.</p>
                     <p>A copy of this treaty was ſent by Mr. Maſon, one of the ſenators from Virginia, to the editor of the Aurora, in Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, that it might be publiſhed.</p>
                     <p>On Tueſday the 7th of July, the editors of the Chronicle advertiſed, in the Mercury, that a copy of the treaty before referred to, was brought by expreſs from Philadelphia, and was for ſale at their office, and at Larkin's book ſtore, in Cornhill.</p>
                     <p>On the 8th of July, a notification, iſſued by order of the ſelect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Boſton, notifying the inhabitants to meet on the 10th, agreeably to the requeſt of a number of inhabitants, to take into their moſt ſerious conſideration, ſuch meaſures as might be deemed expedient, relative to the treaty pending between the United States and Great Britain.</p>
                     <p>On the 9th of July, the editors of the Chronicle publiſhed in their paper, the eight firſt articles of the treaty.</p>

The foregoing was the only publication of the treaty, prior to the meeting of the inhabitants on the 10th, except a publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its ſuppoſed contents, by ſome one who had read it, and which, on compariſon with Mr. Maſon's copy, appears to be incorrect.</p>
                     <p>On the 10th, the inhabitants met in Faneuil Hall, where, 1500 of the citizens, without reading the treaty there, voted their diſapprobation, and not one appeared in favor of it.</p>
                     <p>A committee of fifteen was appointed, "to report the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in writing, which led to the diſapprobation of the treaty."</p>
                     <p>On the Monday following, being the 13th, the committee reported the objections of the town, before the reading of which, the treaty was read.—The objections were then accepted by the town, without one diſſenting voice; and a vote paſſed, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their immediate tranſmiſſion to the preſident of the United States, and expreſſing "their earneſt hope and confident reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that the reaſons aſſigned would have their influence to withhold his ſignature from the ratification of this alarming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument."</p>

                     <p>Duty of ourſelves demands that we ſhould reſpect the legal and conſtitutional doings of thoſe we have appointed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Men who love their country, will endeavour to ſupport its government, at leaſt will refrain from groſsly criminating its conduct, until they have been convinced that no good reaſons can be offered, for that which to them may at firſt appear doubtful. Such men ought not inſtantly to enliſt under the hanners of its avowed opponents, nor haſtily ſurrender their judgments to thoſe who have uniformly calumniated all thoſe acts, which time and experience have ſanctioned, as wiſe, and productive of greater proſperity than is enjoyed in any other country. Men who know the value of character, from a juſt regard of their own—who have ſenſibility duly to appreciate the worth of public ſame—will be cautious how they attempt to inflict a wound on the reputation of others, which, if aimed at themſelves, would produce the moſt painful ſenſations.</p>
                     <p>The town of Boſton has given its reaſons for aſſertions which have ſo deeply wounded the honor of the government; and which aſſertions, if true, muſt extremely weaken the confidence of the people in the ſuperiority of their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
                     <p>Permit, therefore, Mr. Ruſſell, a fellow citizen, through the medium of your paper, to examine the ſolidity of their reaſons, in proof that this declaration, that "the treaty, if ratified, will be highly injurious to the commercial intereſts of the United States, derogatory to their national honor and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence, and may be dangerous to the peace and happineſs of their citizens."</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, "This compact (meaning the treaty) profeſſes to have no reference to the merits of the complaints and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions of the contracting parties; but in reality the complaints and pretenſions of Great Britain are fully provided for, while a
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:028389_0351_0FD8EA9FF7B53330"/>part only of thoſe of the United States have been brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to conſideration."</p>
                     <p>The words of the treaty are, that "the parties being deſirous, by a treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation, to terminate their differences, in ſuch a manner, as (without reference to the merits of their reſpective complaints and pretenſions) may be the beſt calculated to produce mutual ſatisfaction and good underſtanding." The words of the treaty are copied here, that, by comparing them with the firſt reaſon of the town, the public may judge of their true import, and not be induced to bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ve, that the two nations met together, with the deſign of terminating their differences, and, at the ſame time, diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded the real ſubjects of controverſy.</p>
                     <p>The great charge in this reaſon is, that the complaints and pretenſions of Great Britain are fully provided for, while a part only of thoſe of the United States have been brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to conſideration.</p>
                     <p>It is to be preſumed, that the committee meant here, that the miniſter on the part of America, never brought into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration all the complaints and pretenſions of his country. Becauſe, if brought into conſideration, and proved to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, or, for any reaſon, waved, it could not be expected, that ſuch conſideration, or the reaſons which refuted the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, ſhould appear in the treaty; it would be uſeleſs and unprecedented.</p>
                     <p>That the American miniſter did not bring them into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, is an aſſumption of a fact by the committee, for which they have not given any evidence.</p>
                     <p>If the correſpondence and arguments uſed by the miniſter who negociated the treaty, were before the town, or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee—or if they had ſuch information of their doings, as could be relied on—it would probably have been ſtated. Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour requires, that before a charge of groſs neglect is believed againſt any man, ſome evidence ſhould be adduced to ſupport the charge.</p>
                     <p>That every complaint and pretenſion of the United States was duly made and enforced by the American miniſter, is to be preſumed from his known fidelity, underſtanding, and patriot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm. It may alſo be inferred from the following conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</p>
                     <p>The preſident of the United States undoubtedly gave him inſtructions on this head. The report made of the negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would ſhow whether any thing was neglected on the part of the United States. This report was probably before the ſenate.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="65" facs="unknown:028389_0352_0FD8EAA50F86E638"/>
It is not preſumable, that the preſident would accept the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of his miniſter as ſatisfactory, or conſider the negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as completed, unleſs every matter of importance was brought into conſideration; or that the ſenate would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to the preſident, to ratify a treaty that was to terminate all differences, where it appeared to them that the complaints of our own country were not brought into conſideration. Further, it is not probable, that the minority of the ſenate, who had before them the whole negociation, would have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected to ſtate this, if it had exiſted, as a reaſon for rejecting the treaty; whereas, in the communication made by Mr. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, no ſuch charge appears, nor in the motions of Mr. Taze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well and Mr. Burr. It may, therefore, fairly be inferred, until the town or its committee pleaſe to give ſome evidence to the contrary, that every complaint and pretenſion of the United States, was brought into conſideration.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond reaſon is, "Becauſe, in the ſtipulation which ſurrenders our poſts on the weſtern frontiers, no proviſion is made to indemnify the United States, for the commercial and other loſſes they have ſuſtained, and the heavy expenſes to which they have been ſubjected, in conſequence of being kept out of poſſeſſion for twelve years, in direct violation of the treaty of peace."</p>
                     <p>In this reaſon, the town muſt intend that no treaty ſhould be acceded to, unleſs the Britiſh nation would firſt agree to indemnify the United States for all loſſes, that aroſe from our not being in poſſeſſion of the poſts the laſt twelve years.</p>
                     <p>This would be on the part of Great Britain to acknowledge that the inexecution of the treaty of 1783, was entirely her fault—This is probably a matter, ſhe would diſpute; and we are in candour obliged to acknowledge, that the 4th article of that treaty, which relates to payment of debts, was oppoſed by ſome of the ſtates very ſoon after, if not before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitive treaty was ſigned; and that it continued unexecuted in ſome of the ſouthern ſtates, until the federal government was eſtabliſhed. If ſhe can juſtly impute the firſt breach to the United States, our claim of indemnity, for her violation, muſt be doubtful. But ſuppoſing it otherwiſe, and that it be clear to us, that ſhe retained the poſts wrongfully, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any juſt provocation on our part—Is it probable that ſhe would ſo humiliate herſelf, as to confeſs ſhe was the only party who had acted wrong, and avow herſelf the author or cauſe of all the calamities which have, or which we ſuppoſe have been derived from the inexecution of the treaty, and now ſubmit to pay all the damages that had ariſen therefrom?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="66" facs="unknown:028389_0353_0FD8EAA68D30FBD0"/>
In the various wars that have taken place for the wrongful detention of territories; few, if any, are the inſtances, that the vanquiſhed nation has paid for the injuries and loſſes that have ariſen from ſuch detention.</p>
                     <p>The moſt that is commonly attained, is a reſtoration of ſuch territory. Independent nations, owning no ſuperior, qualified to judge of their conduct, will ſeldom acknowledge they have done wrong, eſpecially when poſſeſſed of power to ſupport their own cauſe. It is wiſe both in a miniſter, and a nation, to refrain from inſiſting on points, which would only produce crimination, and recrimination, without advancing the great objects of their negociation. Let the candid conſider, if it is probable, that any reaſoning they could ſuggeſt, would have induced Great Britain, to accede to ſuch a ſtipulation as this objection ſuppoſes.</p>
                     <p>If not, would it be wiſe in us to refuſe the poſts, and ſtill ſuffer the evils we feel from being deprived of them—or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to gain them by force? If ſucceſsful in this latter mode, is it probable, that, at the end of a war, we could induce Britain to pay us the loſſes ſuffered by the twelve years deten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, added to the duration of hoſtilities, and the further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes of a war, undertaken to regain them? There are few men, who will ſay ſuch an event can be calculated on—If, thou, it is not probable that Great Britain could be induced by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to accede to this ſtipulation, nor that we could have attained it by war, it muſt certainly be conſidered wiſe in the miniſter to accept the poſts, and in the ſenate to adviſe the ratification of the treaty, notwithſtanding ſhe did not ſtipulate to pay the loſſes conſequent on her detention of them.—It ought alſo to be remarked, that although much has been ſaid about me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <head>No. II.</head>
                     <p>THE third reaſon of the town of Boſton againſt ratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the treaty, is, becauſe no indemnification is to be made to the citizens of the United States for property taken from them at the cloſe of the war, the reſtitution of which is provided for by the ſame treaty.</p>
                     <p>The words of the treaty of 1783, referred to by the town, are probably theſe, "His Britannic majeſty ſhall, with all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient ſpeed, and without cauſing any deſtruction, or carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away any negroes, or other property of the American in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, withdraw all his armies," &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>It is underſtood, that the United States contend, that this deſcription applies to negroes, remaining within the Britiſh lines after the peace, but who, having been captured, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited by proclamation, had fled to the Britiſh during the war. The Britiſh government contend for another conſtruction, and ſay, that negroes captured in war, or who, invited by procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, had taken refuge with them during the war, could be conſidered as American property, no more than ſhips taken, or horſes ſtrayed to them during the war. That, on the capture of negroes by the Britiſh, or the acceding by the negroes to the terms of their proclamation, they ceaſed to be the property of the Americans.</p>
                     <p>If this reaſoning of the Britiſh be not ſatisfactory to the people of the United States, candour will oblige them to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, that the Britiſh government may think it juſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, a point extremely hard, if not impoſſible, to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from them, ſince the conceſſion would imply a ſacrifice of the public faith, which had been pledged to the negroes. It is not known, that the Britiſh carried away other property.</p>
                     <p>The amount in value, depending on this point, is greatly exaggerated, having been ſtated, in converſation, at many millions of dollars; while it is known, from authentic docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that the whole number of negroes, to whom the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions in the treaty could poſſibly relate, fall ſhort of 3000, that being the total carried away after the peace, including many free negroes, and many ſlaves, who, with their proper maſters, had taken refuge within the Britiſh lines. Let any man make the probable deduction for free negroes, and thoſe ſlaves who accompanied their maſters, and conſider that the remainder included thoſe of extreme old age, and the youngeſt infants, the ſick and the well, the worthleſs, and thoſe of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, and he muſt be convinced, however unſatisfactory the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction given by the Britiſh may be to his mind, that the evil
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:028389_0355_0FD8EAAE2586B080"/>is not of great magnitude, by no means ſufficient to preſs an indemnity for, in hazard of the property taken from our citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens on the ocean, in hazard of our peace, and other articles of the treaty, which may be conſidered beneficial to the United States.</p>
                     <p>The fourth reaſon is, "Becauſe the capture of veſſels and property of the citizens of the United States, made under the authority of the government of Great Britain, is a national concern; and claims, ariſing from ſuch captures, ought not to have been ſubmitted to the deciſion of their admiralty courts; as the United States are thereby precluded from having any voice in the final determination of ſuch caſes, and becauſe the indemnification propoſed to be made, is to be ſought by a proceſs, tedious and expenſive, in which juſtice may be delayed to an unreaſonable time; and eventually loſt to many of the ſufferers, from their inability to purſue it; and becauſe this mode of indemnification bears no proportion to the ſummary method adopted for the ſatisfaction of Britiſh claims."</p>
                     <p>The firſt charge here is, that claims ariſing from captures made on American property ought not to have been ſubmitted to the deciſion of their admiralty courts.</p>
                     <p>In the year 1753, the king of Pruſſia complained to the king of Great Britain, that the property of his ſubjects had been unlawfully captured and condemned on the high ſeas, by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the king of Great Britain. The reply then was, that the property had been regularly tried in the admiralty courts of Great Britain, which courts tried cauſes according to the univerſal law of nations, and the ſtipulations of treaty; that affairs of this kind are and can be cognizable only in the courts belonging to that power where the ſeizure is made.</p>
                     <p>In our own country, the Britiſh miniſter complained to Mr. Jefferſon, then ſecretary of ſtate, that certain ſubjects of his king were injured by an inability to obtain their juſt demands.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Jefferſon replied, "that no nation can anſwer for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect exactitude of proceedings in all their inferior courts—it ſuffices to provide a ſupreme judicature, where error and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality will be ultimately corrected. With this qualification, we have heretofore been in the habit of conſidering the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of juſtice in Great Britain, as extremely pure. The adminiſtration of juſtice is a branch of the ſovereignty over a country, and belongs excluſively to the nation inhabiting it— When a cauſe has been adjudged, according to the rules and forms of the country, its juſtice ought to be preſumed.—If any inſtances of unlawful impediments have exiſted in any of
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:028389_0356_0FD8EAAF9702BF40"/>the inferior tribunals, they would, like other unlawful proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, have been over-ruled on an appeal to the higher courts. If not over-ruled, then a complaint to the government would have been regular, and their interference probably effectual. If your citizens would not proſecute their rights, it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they ſhould recover them, or be denied recovery: and, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til a denial of right through all the tribunals, there is no ground of complaint."</p>
                     <p>Here it appears, that, in other caſes, and with other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, this has been thought juſt by Great Britain: and, in our own country, the doctrine has been adopted towards Great Britain, and acquieſced in on her part.</p>
                     <p>It ought likewiſe to be remarked, that moſt of the ſeizures complained of by the American citizens, have been made by privateers owned by private individuals; and that every Britiſh ſubject has a right, which neither king nor miniſter can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him of, to have his cauſe tried by the courts of his country; and it is not impoſſible that ſome claims may have been made by Americans, where the property is liable, by the law of nations, to be condemned. It ought alſo to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, that the Britiſh government made proviſion for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular bringing forward to trial, cauſes, which, from certain circumſtances of the claimants, had, by ſtrict law, loſt their right to a trial in the ſupreme courts of admiralty; and that our own government has ſent a perſon to procure papers and documents from the courts of vice admiralty, to ſupport the claims of our citizens; to enter appeals, and give ſecurity for their proſecution, free of expenſe, to the claimants. The trial by admiralty courts is ſupported, alluded to, and enforced by many treaties. "In this method, all captures at ſea have been tried, during all the late wars, by the European powers, and ſubmitted to by the neutral powers. By courts of admiralty, acting according to the laws of nations, and particular trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, all captures at ſea have immemorially been judged of, in every country of Europe; any other method of trial would be manifeſtly unjuſt, abſurd, and impracticable." Thus the law and cuſtoms of nations have been ſtated by the ableſt and moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable civilians of the preſent age.</p>
                     <p>It may juſtly be inferred, that the evils of the unfortunate people, whoſe property has been captured, will be redreſſed, in a manner known and practiſed by other nations, in ſimilar caſes, and recognized as right by ourſelves;—that the injuries, apprehended by the town for the ſufferers, from the expenſe attending the ſuits, and their incapacity to purſue their claims, have been fully provided for by the American government.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="70" facs="unknown:028389_0357_0FD8EAB109351228"/>
To provide againſt evils which this method might not reach, it is expreſsly warranted, in the 7th article of the treaty, "that in all caſes where adequate compenſation cannot, for whatever reaſon, be now actually obtained, had, and received, by the ſaid merchants and others, in the ordinary courſe of juſtice, full and complete compenſation for the ſame, will be made by the Britiſh government to the ſaid complainants."</p>
                     <p>The other part of the charge, contained in this reaſon, is, that the mode of indemnification bears no proportion to the ſummary one adopted for the ſatisfaction of Britiſh claims.</p>
                     <p>The ſame 7th article of the treaty ſtipulates, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the preſident, as contained in Mr. Jefferſon's let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of the 5th of September, 1793, to Mr. Hammond, ſhall be carried into execution. This letter, which is annexed to the treaty, ſtates, that having, for particular reaſons, forborne to uſe all the means in the power of the United States, for the reſtitution of certain veſſels, the preſident thought it incumbent on the United States to make compenſation therefor.</p>
                     <p>The government of the United States, voluntarily forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make uſe of all the means in their power to obtain juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice for certain Britiſh ſubjects, is certainly a different caſe from captures by Britiſh ſubjects, of American property, on which the Britiſh government expreſsly ſtipulates, that ſhe will make uſe of all the means in her power to obtain reſtitution from the captors, of property wrongfully taken; and, if theſe means are inadequate, from whatever reaſon, ſhe will make full and complete compenſation to the complainants. The American government having decided, that the demand of the Britiſh miniſter was right, choſe between two evils, viz. That of compelling reſtitution from the wrong-doer when in their power, or making compenſation itſelf.—It choſe the latter.</p>
                     <p>The Britiſh government choſe the former; and Mr. Jefferſon declares, in the letter before referred to, "that where all the means in the power of the nation are uſed to obtain reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and they fail; he did not mean to give an opinion, that reſtitution ought to be made by the government;" but, in this caſe, Mr. Jay has induced the Britiſh government to uſe all the means in their power, and make compenſation, when theſe fail.</p>
                     <p>It is preſumed, that a reference to the article in the treaty, Mr. Jefferſon's letter, and a conſideration of the law of nations, as recognized by Europe and America, will convince all candid men, that the fourth reaſon of the town ought to have no weight againſt the treaty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="71" facs="unknown:028389_0358_0FD8EAB664D83488"/>
The fifth reaſon is, "Becauſe this compact admits Britiſh ſubjects to an equal participation with our own citizens, of the interior traffic of the United States with the Indians, through our whole territorial dominions, while the advantages oſtenſibly reciprocated to our citizens, are limited both in their nature and extent."</p>
                     <p>It hath been well underſtood, by men acquainted with the country, occupied by the Indians, within the territory of the United States, and that which falls within the Britiſh dominions, that by far the greateſt proportion of furs are collected within the Britiſh dominions. If this is true, much is gained to the United States by the fur trade, while Britain has nothing in return, but the liberty of traverſing a wilderneſs, from which no traffic can be obtained. A little reflection will convince us, that our means of paying for ſuch furs, and our export trade, opened by this treaty, are really ſuperior to the benefits de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to Britain, and will prove a ſource of great wealth to the Americans.</p>
                     <p>While we are poſſeſſed of an extent of ſea coaſt, ſo immenſe, compared with that of Great Britain, it will readily be ſeen, that the European and Aſiatic goods (the latter of which can be afforded on better terms by us, than the ſubjects of Great Britain) exported from the United States, into their interior countries, muſt greatly exceed any quantities the Britiſh colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts can bring into the United States on that quarter. The embarraſſments attending an importation from Europe into Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada, New Brunſwic, and Nova Scotia, by ſea, and confined as thoſe inhabitants of the countries are in their trade to the mother country, compared with our advantages of ſupplying them, by our eaſy communication with them, and with every part of the world, will convince all candid men, that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, of this part of the treaty, are chiefly on our ſide.</p>
                     <p>But ſtill it may be ſaid, they have a right to come into our country, and we have not a right to enter the ſeaports of their colonies in our own veſſels. If it appears from an examination of the advantages and diſadvantages of the article of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty here referred, to that we receive more than we grant, it muſt be admitted that this reaſon ought not to prevail againſt a ratification of the treaty.</p>
                     <p>By the treaty we are equally admitted into each other's terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory on the land board, for the purpoſes of traffic. Before the treaty is ratified, neither enjoys this right. They enter our ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports as freely now, as they can by the treaty—we are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to enter theirs. This inſtrument gives them no new right on the ſea board. It does not diminiſh any we poſſeſs. Under
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:028389_0359_0FD8EAB86FEACCC8"/>the treaty, we can carry on commerce with their colonies by land. From reaſons before ſtated, our trade there muſt be very advantageous, while theirs in our territory cannot be diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous.</p>
                     <p>By this article, therefore, it appears we have gained much, for which we have given but little, if any thing; for none will pretend, that by the means of the lakes, the Britiſh coloniſts can under-ſell the American merchant; ſtill leſs will any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that we do not gain immenſely more of the fur trade than we grant.</p>
                     <p>The ſixth reaſon is, "Becauſe the alien duty upon our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, imported into the United States by Britiſh ſubjects, in their own bottoms, is, if not wholly ſuſpended, at leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted not to be increaſed."</p>
                     <p>The 15th article of the treaty contains a ſtipulation of both parties, that places their ſhips and merchandizes reciprocally on the footing of the moſt favored nations, and merely reſerves a right to the Britiſh government, to impoſe on American veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, entering into Britiſh ports in Europe, a tonnage duty equal to what Britiſh veſſels pay in American ports, and ſuch duty as may be adequate to countervail the difference of duty, now payable on the importation of European and Aſiatic goods, when imported into the United States, in Britiſh or in Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can veſſels.</p>
                     <p>This muſt be the article to which the ſixth reaſon alludes— and it certainly cannot be "derogatory to our national honor and independence" to be willing to meet the Britiſh nation on terms of equality; when it is conſidered, that we have ſimilar articles in our treaties with France, the United Netherlands, Sweden, and Pruſſia; that it is common in moſt of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern treaties, and eſpecially was of late inſerted in the treaty between France and Great Britain; at leaſt, it behoves thoſe who make the objections, to ſhow in what conſiſts our power to compel a nation to trade with us, on terms by which we ſhall impoſe heavier duties on her trade, than we do on others, while ſhe impoſes no heavier duties on us, than ſhe does on others. In general terms, it has been ſaid, that the treaty was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal —here is an objection, that it is reciprocal.</p>

                        <salute>SIR,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>IT is reſpectfully conceived, that there are few points of objection to the treaty, which require a more diſpaſſionate and full examination, than that which turns upon the omitted compenſation for the negroes taken away in 1783. It is not pertinent to urge, as hath been done, in favor of an erroneous conſtruction of the treaty of peace, that there is, ſtrictly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, no property in men. It is very unhappy, indeed, but it is alſo true, that the cenſus of 1791 proves the exiſtence of ſuch property, as well in the <hi>eaſtern</hi> and <hi>middle,</hi> as in the ſouthern ſtates; and that the laws of both the contracting nations, ſtill continue to maintain this property in men, in many parts of their reſpective dominions. Were a general manumiſſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to take place, the ableſt friends of the treaty will can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly acknowledge, that <hi>political order,</hi> the beſt reſult of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man wiſdom and virtue, would, for a long time, be baniſhed from our land.</p>
                     <p>Thus much has been ſaid upon this point, becauſe ſuggeſtions of a local aſpect, and calculated to beget heat and to excite prejudices (which, though truly amiable, are unfavorable to fair diſcuſſion) have been occaſionally made by writers on the treaty.</p>
                     <p>It is underſtood, that the Britiſh government have formerly, or recently urged the following objections to our allegations, that they firſt infringed the treaty of peace by carrying away the negroes from New-York.</p>
                     <p n="1">1ſt. They have obſerved, as it is ſaid, that it was an evident miſconſtruction of the treaty, and might even be deemed offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to them, to ſay that they had ſtipulated to commit ſuch a breach of faith, as their delivering up to ſlavery, men, who had been induced among them by promiſes of protection and freedom.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="76" facs="unknown:028389_0363_0FD8EAC3C9EC0DE8"/>
2dly. That the negroes were property in America; that a part of them were taken in war by the Britiſh troops and were conſequently <hi>"booty"</hi> to them, and no longer the property of the American inhabitants; that the words of the ſtipulation are, "Negroes and <hi>other property</hi> of the American inhabitants."</p>
                     <p n="3">3dly. That another part of the negroes had come within their lines, and were to be conſidered <hi>"as ſtrays."</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4thly. That the article concerning the negroes in the treaty of peace, might refer and apply to thoſe negroes which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the American inhabitants <hi>within the Britiſh lines.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In conſidering theſe anſwers, which, it is ſincerely meant, ſir, to ſtate fairly, a great inconſiſtency occurs between the firſt and third reaſon. In the firſt reaſon it is alleged, that the negroes were <hi>induced</hi> (i. e. <hi>led</hi>) within the Britiſh lines; that is, that they went thither for an object <hi>aforethought;</hi> for an object <hi>promiſed</hi> to them, for an object <hi>previouſly deſired</hi> by them, for an object, which was <hi>ſo well underſtood between the parties,</hi> that it could not be taken away, conſiſtently with the maxi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>s of one of them, concerning morals, faith, and policy. But in the <hi>third</hi> reaſon, it is alleged, that ſome of the negroes were as <hi>"ſtrays"</hi> in the Britiſh camps and lines, though induced (<hi>led</hi> or <hi>attracted</hi>) thither by the ſtrongeſt allurements and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences, though free human agents, at leaſt, in that particular; poſſeſſing intellectual minds, knowing the places from which and through which they went, and whither, <hi>on reflection,</hi> they <hi>intended</hi> to go and did go, and at which places of deſtination, they <hi>accordingly ſtopt,</hi> and demanded the objects, for which they purpoſely went thither, and that, too, upon the faith of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Britiſh commanders, which they had heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they left the places from which they are alleged to have <hi>"ſtrayed."</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But further, if any part of the negroes were <hi>"ſtrays"</hi> they were not <hi>"booty"</hi> taken in war by an enemy. Conſequently the property of the American inhabitants was not changed <hi>by capture.</hi> No capture had taken place, and they ought not to have been carried away from their owners. All ſuch negroes muſt have come within the words uſed, which are, "<hi>any</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes or other property of the American inhabitants." Moreover as <hi>the reſtoration of ſtrays,</hi> on paying charges, is dictated no leſs by common honeſty and cuſtom, than by the treaty, it was but a ſmall conceſſion to that ſpirit of juſtice, friendſhip, and liberality, which was mutually profeſſed at the ſettlement of peace.</p>
                     <p>The 4th reaſon will appear to be quite unfound. The article concerning the negroes was manifeſtly intended to reſtrain the
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:028389_0364_0FD8EAC6120D8948"/>Britiſh forces from taking away certain objects. This could not have been propoſed by the Britiſh commiſſioner, but, indeed, required ſome delicacy to be brought forward by the American commiſſioners, as it might convey an imputation or ſuſpicion of plunder againſt the Britiſh troops. It is material, ſir, that the mind ſhould be ſatisfied, that this article was demanded on the part of the United States, becauſe it muſt be clear that the American commiſſioners could not have meant by it, to bring forward a ſtipulation to preſerve the property of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious American inhabitants, who were found within the Britiſh lines. <hi>It is equally clear, that the Britiſh commiſſioner could not but conſider it as an inſult to him and his nation, if the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can commiſſioners had required a formal promiſe, that their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals and admirals ſhould not deſpoil the unfortunate people within their lines (in the moment of leaving them) of their negroes and other property.</hi> There is much ſolicitude for the loyaliſts, manifeſted by the Britiſh government in the old treaty, but not for the negroes. A kind diſpoſition to them probably was not at all wanting; but in the variety and importance of other objects, they may have been overlooked by the Britiſh commiſſioner at Paris. The firſt attraction of attention to the ſituation of theſe negroes has probably been in New-York, where the promiſes of the generals and admirals, and of the officers commanding the black corps, brought the caſe perſonally home to ſome of them, and the negroes themſelves would prove ſtrong, though ſimple, remonſtrants againſt the meaſure. Their caſe was ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and hard, and it was humane and prudent to let them go, under the idea of a compenſation in money.</p>
                     <p>If it appears ſatisfactorily reaſonable, that the article in queſtion, of the treaty of peace, could not be particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to prevent the Britiſh from carrying away the negroes belonging to the people within their lines, then it will follow, that the ſtipulation could have no meaning at all, unleſs it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to thoſe who had left their maſter's houſes without the lines, and repaired to the Britiſh camps, or were picked up in the courſe of their marches: That is, the ſtipulation could have only applied to thoſe claimed by our government in all its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments and in every ſtage of our affairs. It is held to be concluſive againſt any conſtruction of a treaty, that ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction involves <hi>"an abſurdity;"</hi> and ſurely it is perfectly irrational to make a ſolemn ſtipulation, which has no object to which it can apply or refer.</p>
                     <p>The words, <hi>"any negroes",</hi> are very explicit, and do not carry the idea of property at all. It was the duty of the Britiſh commiſſioner to have propoſed a clear and definite exception
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:028389_0365_0FD8EAC811214CB8"/>of any portion of them to which he thought they had acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a title. Not doing ſo, we have a right to the broad mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word <hi>"any"</hi> The United States might conſider the negroes in two diviſions, one part as taken in war, and another part (the greateſt) as going voluntarily into the Britiſh lines. The property in the latter was not altered or affected by capture. They were, by the laws, <hi>"runaways."</hi> The <hi>maſter's legal right was not impaired.</hi> The words, "<hi>any</hi> negroes," would include <hi>both</hi> deſcriptions, and the ſubſequent words, "other property," might follow, as a part, at leaſt, of the negroes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the property of American owners. Moreover; ſome of the negroes were taken upon the high ſeas, and upon the bays of Cheſapeake and Charleſton; and, ſince the moſt ſtrict ideas drawn from the laws of property and war are recurred to, it may be fair to ſay, that the property in them could not be changed, until after a regular trial and condemnation in a court of admiralty in each caſe. This was done by the American privateer-owners, when they took negroes in their prizes, and was wanting, no doubt, in many caſes in New-York. Thoſe negroes remained, therefore, the property of the American in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.</p>
                     <p>When an expreſſion, in ſo ſolemn and important an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as a treaty, is conſtructed and inſerted in the utmoſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude (as "<hi>any</hi> negroes") it is dangerous to truth, to the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the contracting parties and to their peace, to narrow it down by inferences from <hi>ſubſequent</hi> words. A ſlight relative inaccuracy in a following expreſſion may deſtroy the meaning, utility, and effect of language, the moſt clear and unequivocal. In the inſtance before us, ſir, this really appears to be the caſe. The words <hi>"other property"</hi> are made, by Great Britain, to narrow unduly the preceding words. Taking in all that has happened and all that was talked over, the paſſage might have been fairly conſtrued thus: all captured and runaway negroes and property of the American inhabitants.</p>
                     <p>The conduct of this government, at the moment of the fact, was attended with unanimity, was decided, and clear. Two opinions were not entertained upon the ſubject. A very able friend of the pending treaty (Mr. Hamilton, of New York) moved a reſolution on the 23d May 1783, in his place in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, "that a conſiderable number of negroes, belonging to the citizens of theſe ſtates, have been carried off <hi>contrary to the true intent and meaning of the ſaid (preliminary) articles."</hi> This motion was ſeconded by Mr. Izard (of South Carolina) and carried without a diviſion. Conſequent meaſures were, at
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:028389_0366_0FD8EACBB311A778"/>the ſame time, adopted by congreſs to obtain ſatisfaction from the Britiſh government.</p>
                     <p>Your own opinions and convictions, ſir, on this point, at that time, are generally underſtood to have been decided, that the carrying away the negroes, as it was done, was an infrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the treaty. Your own memory, ſir, your correſpondence with congreſs and with the Britiſh commanders, and your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to Mr. Benſon, Lieutenant-colonel Smith, and Mr. Parker, the American commiſſioners, place within your power the ſure means of aſcertaining the ideas you entertained upon the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>From the three unſucceſsful motions in the ſenate, made by Mr. Burr, Mr. Tanewell, and Mr. Gunn, which ſeverally had for their object further amicable negociation for the value of the negroes, and for one or the other of which three mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>every member</hi> of the ſenate (except, it is believed, two who were ſick) voted, it may be conſidered as <hi>the unanimous opinion of the ſenate,</hi> that <hi>this claim was not placed by the treaty, upon a juſt and ſatisfactory footing.</hi> But, ſir, the circumſtances preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the treaty of peace, throw conſiderable light upon the tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> meaning of the article relative to the negroes. It appears from the extracts and minutes in Mr. Jefferſon's "Papers relative to Great Britain,"<note n="*" place="bottom">See Carey's Edition, pages 100—103.</note> which accompanied your meſſage to congreſs, of the 5th of December, 1793, that the American commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers at Paris, in 1782, had held up to the Britiſh commiſſioner, general claims for negroes and other property carried away in the courſe of the war from the ſeveral ſeaports, which had been occupied, as poſts, by the Britiſh forces. It appears, that the retroſpective claim was not u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The United States would profit by a rigid ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to ſtrictly legal ideas in the treaty of peace, becauſe all debts <hi>legally</hi> extinguiſhed, had ſo completely ceaſed to be

                        <hi>debts,</hi> that the fifth article could not apply to them. Theſe were many.</p>
                     <p>But, ſir, the propriety of the Britiſh commanders holding the negroes taken on land as <hi>"booty,"</hi> admits of ſome obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Civilized nations do not now deem it proper, that their forces ſhould take as booty, the property of private perſons, not actually ſound in arms. It is not at all uncommon to pay individuals for horſes, forage, fuel and proviſions. The ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing effects of the principle of <hi>"booty,"</hi> have been commuted for the more humane meaſure of contribution. The war was of a peculiar character and nature; and for that and other reaſons, it was not to be expected, that, in the moment of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, Great Britain was to loſe ſight of theſe ideas, nor that the would be governed by <hi>ſummum jus,</hi> in her ſtipulations with the United States. Her agreement not to carry away any more negroes, was a meaſure conſiſtent with "the liberal, manly, and candid manner" in which Mr. Oſwald is declared, by Mr. Adams, Doctor Franklin, and Mr. Jay, to "have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted the negociations for peace." It appears reaſonable to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that a commiſſioner, ſo characterized, would be deſirous to remove from the final act of amicable ſeparation, to which both parties had agreed, every thing which might wound the American feelings, or keep alive the painful ſenſibilities, which had reſulted from the immenſe deſtruction of an invaſive war. He well knew, that the American commiſſioners had repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the parts of this country which owed money to Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, as in ſome degree incapacitated from paying their debts, by the loſs of the negroes, which had already been taken away: and though he might be averſe to admit the large ſchedule of loſſes of which the negroes, <hi>previouſly removed,</hi> formed a great part, he might naturally compromiſe the claim for the paſt and for the pending, by agreeing in the moſt latitudinary terms and ideas, that the troops of his nation ſhould inoffenſively and harmleſsly depart without carrying away "<hi>any</hi> negroes or other property of the American inhabitants." Upon critical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, it will be perceived that this expreſſion is not <hi>entirely</hi> wrong, though inaccurate, ſeeing that there was one deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the general maſs of negroes to be left, who are now admitted to be property <hi>by both parties:</hi> namely, thoſe belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the inhabitants within the lines.</p>
                     <p>Writers upon <hi>the interpretation of treaties</hi> may be properly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted upon this ſubject. They juſtly admit us to reaſon from <hi>the general views of the contracting parties.</hi> Theſe have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready noticed in the preceding detail, and it is hoped, ſir, that the length and particularity of the ſtatement will be excuſed on
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:028389_0368_0FD8EACF36DE4B90"/>account of the great importance of the facts, as evidences of the highly probable or real views of the parties.</p>
                     <p>It is another rule of interpretation, that when late excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are made, by a promiſing party, to the moſt extenſive meaning of the words uſed, he may be reminded, that he ought, at the time, to have modified the promiſe, by altering the expreſſion. "<hi>Any</hi> negroes," including all without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the party promiſing cannot now narrow the meaning of thoſe words, by ſuggeſtions from his own mind or by calling in a ſubſequent expreſſion to limit the right of the United States.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo a rule, that <hi>neither party has a right to interpret. a treaty as he pleaſes.</hi> So that differing in their ideas, as the two governments do, the United States have <hi>a right</hi> to ſome equal mode of ſettling the claim. Two feigned caſes, one to be tried in the higheſt court of each country, and to determine the matter in favor of that party which might prove ſucceſsful in both, are ſuggeſted with deference and ſome doubt. If the courts differed in their decrees, we ſhould be, at leaſt, as well as we are. Commiſſioners, with all the lights derived from the two hearings, might then terminate the matter. Now Great Britain <hi>preſcribes</hi> the ſenſe of the article contrary to our ideas, and, of courſe, contrary to rule. (See Vattel, book 2. ch. 7.)</p>
                     <p>It is to be remembered, that the rules of interpretation, laid down in the law of nations, are conſidered as binding upon all reaſonable governments.</p>
                     <p>It has already been remarked, that every interpretation, which leads to abſurdity, is to be rejected. On this rule, it may be further obſerved, that it would be really abſurd to ſuppoſe, that the Britiſh commiſſioner meant to avoid injury to the raiſers of our produce, or that the American commiſſioners meant to ſave the planters and farmers from being incapacitated from paying their debts, by reſtraining the carrying away of the few <hi>domeſtic</hi> ſlaves belonging to the people, reſiding in New-York.</p>
                     <p>Propoſing to continue the examination of this very import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant point in a future paper, I have the honor to ſubſcribe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, with unfeigned and perfect reſpect,</p>

                     <p>IT is propoſed, ſir, reſpectfully to offer to you, in this paper, ſome further reflections upon the article, in the treaty of peace with Great Britain, relative to the negroes.</p>
                     <p>It appears to be fair, in the conſtruction of the treaty, to conſider what would have been the effect of reaſoning, ſimilar to that oppoſed to the United States, if reſorted to in conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other parts of the ſame inſtrument. The <hi>American</hi> artillery was, by the ſame article, to be left in all the evacuated fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Let us ſuppoſe, as was indeed really the caſe, that the cannon, originally belonging to all the fortifications in America, had been caſt in Europe. It might have been urged, that theſe were never <hi>American</hi> in one ſenſe, and in another ſenſe, that they had ceaſed to be American, having become Britiſh by cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Then the article about <hi>American</hi> artillery would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come abſurd, for it would have been a formal ſtipulation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any object, to which it could apply. This caſe is very ſtrong, becauſe the artillery appurtenant (in the ſtrict legal and orthographical ſenſe of that word) to the fortifications, was originally the property of the old royal government, had been aſſumed, with the powers of government, by the people, had been thus acquired, by thoſe who were one party to the treaty, by force, and had been taken <hi>in battle</hi> after the declaration of the independency of the United States, from the armies of that ſovereign body politic by the armies of the other ſovereign body politic, in the courſe of an exiſting and known war; the ſaid artillery being <hi>inſtruments of war belonging to the adverſe power,</hi> and not <hi>private property</hi> appertenant, by its nature, to agriculture and menial houſehold ſervice.</p>
                     <p>In like manner, the ſame article and ſentence of the treaty of peace obligate Great Britain to reſtore and deliver all archives, records, deeds, and papers, belonging to any of the ſtates or to their citizens, unto the proper ſtates and perſons to whom <hi>"they belong;"</hi> and this is accompanied with a declaration, that it ſhall be ſo done, although the ſaid objects, ſo ſtipulated to be delivered, may have been, and were, acquired during the courſe of the war. Here we perceive, that the objects of the ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are conſidered as <hi>belonging</hi> to thoſe from whom they were previouſly acquired in the courſe of the war. If the names and nature of the articles were different, it ſtill will appear, that no preciſe diſtinctions againſt the proper or owning rights or claims of the Americans were meant to be ſet up. Had the arguments, or diſtinction now uſed againſt the United States, been at all
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:028389_0370_0FD8EAD4205D6680"/>contemplated by Mr. Oſwald, he would not, in the ſame ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, have expreſsly ſtated other objects, acquired by his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in war, <hi>"to belong"</hi> to the American ſtates and private perſons.</p>
                     <p>The reaſonings, in the books upon the law of nations, in regard to booty, have been generally applied to clearly perſonal property of <hi>alien</hi> enemies, taken by the army of one country in its marches, battles, ſieges, and aſſaults, from the citizens of the other country. There is an abſolute and undeniable <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity</hi> in the object in queſtion, and in the manner and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances by which the Britiſh troops acquired it, conſtituting a real difference between it and either the ordinary objects of <hi>"booty,"</hi> on the one hand, or <hi>the manner of making "booty"</hi> on the other, as <hi>contemplated</hi> and allowed by the military arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in the law of nations. The difference in quality between <hi>this</hi> and <hi>every</hi> deſcription of perſonal property whatever, is manifeſt and great. And although this fact places the American intereſt, in the preſent queſtion, in a moſt painful light, yet this diſagreeable circumſtance cannot impair the ſtipulations of a treaty between two powers, both actually maintaining and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging, at the time of the contract and ever ſince, the force of thoſe laws, which relate to the object.—Laws coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced by the one, as a parent, in the infancy of the other—laws, which, ere the manhood of the United States was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by the parent country, they had marked with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined hand and a ſincere heart, for gradual abolition and extinction.</p>
                     <p>Such and ſo great is the difference between this ſpecies of property and all others, that we muſt apply to it, with propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate circumſpection and candor, all the ordinary rules and reaſonings about the ſubject of <hi>"booty,"</hi> of war.</p>
                     <p>But if there ſhould be found a great difference between this and the objects of military booty, creating reaſonable doubts, whether it can be completely ſubjected to the rules concerning booty, the difference, in regard to the manner of acquiring ordinary military booty and that of acquiring this object, is much more conſiderable and important. It was not by <hi>force of arms,</hi> nor by <hi>ſtratagem,</hi> nor by <hi>ſurprize,</hi> nor by <hi>the ordinary and allowed operations of enemies,</hi> but it was by ſending to <hi>places to which arms or military ſtratagem or enterprize were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,</hi> and there openly looſening the bands and laws of that civil ſociety, which had been eſtabliſhed by the Britiſh and American—by the party attracting it, and by the party de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of it. It is alſo to be remembered, that thoſe bands and
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:028389_0371_0FD8EAD68C3A0140"/>laws of ſociety then were, and ſtill are exiſting unimpaired <hi>in the dominions of the party ſo acquiring it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are methods of obtaining the poſſeſſion of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of an alien enemy, which would render the property ſo acquired, not <hi>"booty of war."</hi> For example; a military officer of one nation remaining for a time within a town of an hoſtile nation, under the ſanction of a paſſport and flag, carries off the whole military cheſt of the enemy of his nation: or, a detachment of the troops of one nation, obtain the military cheſt of their enemy, from its eſcorting party, ſolely and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly by means prohibited by the laws of war. Will property acquired in theſe ways be conſidered, as "booty" of war? Or will it be conſidered as the acquiſition of irregular individuals, by no means to be retained by the acquirers, but to be reſtored to the owner, particularly ſo far as it ſhall be poſſeſſed at the moment of reconciliation and peace?

                     <p>The governor of Virginia was not a perſon, on ſeveral ſcore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Perſons legally bound to others for a term of years, or for a longer time, could not ſolely by his executive power, be releaſed therefrom.

<pb n="85" facs="unknown:028389_0372_0FD8EAD80D8E3AE8"/>from by moſt of the Britiſh governors of that time, the pain of which, and part of the injuries of which, the ſtipulation of the treaty of peace was well calculated to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move. There are very few, indeed, it is believed, ſir, of the wiſe and good of either country, but what now ſincerely wiſh, that the meaſure of thus calling forth the unhappy blacks, had never been reſorted to.</p>
                     <p>A brief and ſimple remark, ſir, aptly follows the preceding exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the ſtrict legal ground on which the object in queſtion ſtood, as property or not property: That, as the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh commiſſioner firſt uſed words of promiſe, including <hi>all</hi> the negroes, and as he afterwards follows with the words "other <hi>property,</hi>" he muſt have conſidered all the negroes as property, notwithſtanding the changes of ſituation, which they had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone. It does not appear, by the notes of the American commiſſioners, that he ever oppoſed to their complaints or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations about the negroes carried away, in the ſeveral preceding years, that they had been, or, indeed, that thoſe remaining were, legal booty of war, and not objects for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation. The reaſon of a ſtipulation, that is, the motive which led to the making of it, and the end then propoſed, is conſidered, and juſtly, as one of the moſt certain means of eſtabliſhing the true ſenſe; and great attention, ſays Vattel, ought to be paid to it, whenever it is required to explain an obſcure, <hi>equivocal,</hi> and undetermined point, either of a law, or of a treaty, or to make application of them to a particular caſe. We are not left, in this caſe, to vague conjectures. The injuries which <hi>one party had ſuſtained,</hi> by the <hi>attracting</hi> and carrying away <hi>of numbers of negroes</hi> by <hi>the other party,</hi> the bitterneſs of ſpirit it had occaſioned, and the deſire to prevent ſuch injuries, which could no longer wound an enemy, on account of the return of peace, and which would have gone far to baniſh the neceſſary ſpirit of reconciliation, rendered it a matter of found ſenſe and reaſonable buſineſs, to exclude rigid ideas about compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively inconſiderable objects of property, uſeleſs to the Britiſh government, and to deliver up all the negroes, to which no private Britiſh claim was made. The difficulty of the faith pledged to the negroes, abſent and unrepreſented, was very probably overlooked, amidſt the many and great objects which were to be adjuſted. And here it may be obſerved, that, if Great Britain had promiſed an impoſſibility, which promiſe might have taken place, an equitable compenſation, or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhment of the conſideration promiſed therefor by the United States, ought to have ſettled the matter. It will appear, from the papers of the time, to every perſon, who has faith in
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:028389_0373_0FD8EAD9DD2E2378"/>the truth of Mr. Adams, Dr. Franklin, Mr. Jay, or Mr. Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens, that this conſideration was, the removal of the <hi>legal</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments to the recovery of the Britiſh debts. Leave us theſe deſcriptions of our property, and take you thoſe, was the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural language: the <hi>quid pro quo.</hi> The American commiſſioners agreed to every article to which their conceptions of their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers extended. And here it is very material, indeed, to obſerve, that, if the courſe of the buſineſs and the communications be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the American and Britiſh commiſſioners had not effectually and accurately fixed the deſign of the ſtipulation, it is wiſely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the law of nations, in order to promote the peace of mankind, to conjecture the meaning of the parties. Now no ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion or conjecture, as to the object on which the ſtipulation could operate, is offered, except that the offended American commiſſioners may have thereby meant to require Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to engage, that ſhe would not deſpoil the unfortunate peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple within their lines, at the moment when ſhe was leaving them to undergo ſerious difficulties, on account of their being found in that ſituation. This conſtruction, perfectly odious as it regards Great Britain, the rules of interpretation of the law of nations, forbid. To the objection drawn from the odium, in which <hi>the neceſſity to aſk of them ſuch a ſtipulation</hi> would have involved the Britiſh, is to be added the objection, ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in my judgment, that the American commiſſioners would not demand a ſtipulation, excluſively in favor of thoſe with whom they were very highly offended, and omit to ſecure a great maſs of property, much of it belonging to thoſe political friends with whom they had gone through the war, and whoſe caſe was particularly recommended to them by congreſs.</p>
                     <p>It will be juſt remarked here, that the ſtipulation does not ſay, <hi>the</hi> negroes and other property, but <hi>any</hi> negroes, or other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. In a general view, the words, <hi>the negroes</hi> and <hi>other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,</hi> would appear to be more nearly and accurately relative, than the words, <hi>any negroes</hi> or <hi>other property.</hi> The word "other," placed as it is, has rather the appearance of a caſual incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectneſs, than as intended to limit the ſenſe of the broadeſt poſſible words, which precede it, viz. "any negroes," leaving us room to believe, that Mr. Oſwald did not make doubts or difficulties concerning the ideas of property or ownerſhip, notwithſtanding all the circumſtances which the negroes might have undergone. It muſt be admitted, too, that the Britiſh idea of the interpretation does not free the word "other" from incorrectneſs. For <hi>"any,"</hi> taken alone, will include ſlaves, and free and indented negroes, and yet <hi>"other,"</hi> followed by "pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty," does, in their ſenſe, include only one deſcription, being a
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:028389_0374_0FD8EADE2F929E90"/>very ſmall proportion of the whole number of the negroes. This may appear like wire-drawing the ſubject; but ſuch appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances are inevitable, in caſes involving verbal criticiſm.</p>
                     <p>Another, and great, difficulty would reſult from not extending the ſtipulation beyond the ſlaves of perſons within the Britiſh lines. Peace being concluded, their negroes could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, whether Britiſh or American property; ſo that, as to them, the ſtipulation was, in a ſecond view, unneceſſary. There would, therefore, be no object, on which the ſtipulation could operate. The rules for interpreting the law of nations, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, do not permit any ſubſequent words to be ſo conſtrued, as to render a preceding ſtipulation or entire proviſion null and void.</p>
                     <p>It appears not improper to remark, that one party cannot reaſonably plead, that a thing is odious, which he has contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to create in the country or conduct of the other party, and which is continued to be maintained by law in his own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions. To enſlave men is, indeed, in every view an offenſive and diſagreeable buſineſs; but in the ſenſe of an odious ſtipulation under the law of nations, any power which maintains by law the purchaſe of men, never before ſlaves, and tranſports them from their connections, cannot plead, that a ſtipulation could not be intended in a certain ſenſe, becauſe it might make them return men, ſet free, back into ſlavery. It is not here meant to inſinuate the ſlighteſt reproach to Great Britain on this ſubject. It is confidently believed, that ſhe will ſteadily purſue a ſafe and ſuitable plan of aboliſhing the ſlave trade, and ſlavery itſelf, throughout her dominions. In regard to the odiouſneſs of the breach of faith, it has been already obſerved, that it is probable the particular ſituations of all the negroes were not adverted to. No faithleſs intention towards them is believed to have exiſted in the Britiſh government or commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner. The United States did not long inſiſt upon a ſpecific performance of the ſtipulation. There is no reaſon, therefore, to doubt, that they would have cheerfully acquieſced in an equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble compenſation, inſtantly upon its being deſired; and nothing but compenſation is now poſſible. When a ſtipulation is made by an agent, employed as Mr. Oſwald was, on a ſudden, a very able merchant, but not a lawyer, nor verſed in diplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic buſineſs, diſtant from the ſcene to which the negociation relates, and, conſequently, not impreſſed with every minute circumſtance, that had occurred in the operations of the two powers, in a diſtant country, it is not unnatural to ſuppoſe, that he might have contracted for an unobſerved point or two, which could not with propriety be complied with, on account
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:028389_0375_0FD8EAE1CAA34058"/>of engagements to which he did not advert, or even on account of the impoſſibility of performance. If the matter ſtipulated were ever ſo unfavorable (and in that ſenſe odious) or if it were impoſſible, the right of the other party in a clear caſe, to have the unfavorable or (as the law of nations terms it) the odious ſtipulation executed, or the impoſſible one compenſated, would be in full force. The United States, waving the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the odious inadvertent ſtipulation from a becoming re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the feelings and honor of the other party, evidences an accommodating diſpoſition, to ſettle the matter by equitable compenſation.</p>

                     <p>IT has been obſerved by an able writer (under the ſignature of Camillus) who favors a ratification of the treaty, without any further amendments, that negroes, by the laws of the ſtates, in which ſlavery is allowed, are <hi>perſonal</hi> property. He, therefore, argues, that, like horſes and cattle, and other move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables, they were liable to become <hi>"booty."</hi> But, ſir, this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Camillus, though on a point cardinally important to the argument, if againſt him, appears to be incorrect. In Virginia, <hi>negroes did not go to the executors of the deceaſed,</hi> but paſſed, by the laws, with lands and other real eſtate, <hi>by deſcent,</hi> to the heir at law. They were alſo ſubject to the ſame laws of <hi>dower</hi> as real eſtate. They were likewiſe capable of being <hi>entailed,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the laws concerning real eſtate. This ſituation of the laws, was in that very quarter, wherein the Britiſh governor, alluded to above, commenced that executive infringement of them, which has formed the unſound foundation of the opinion, that the blacks could be ſo <hi>attracted or induced</hi> from home, as to become "booty of war." It is very important to this argument, that above half the ſlaves, in the late American provinces, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the people of Virginia, where the foregoing ſtate of law prevailed.</p>

It is not only clear, that a conciliating mind, like Mr. Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald's, muſt have conſidered it as highly eligible for Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, ſo to conduct the act of ſeparation from this country, as to leave no cauſe of diſſatisfaction on account of ſo irritating a matter as ſpoil; but it is certain, that in his tranſactions with the United States, <hi>he</hi> muſt have conſidered them as part of the Britiſh empire, reſiſting its general government, and not as an alien enemy. This muſt have been his notion of the matter; for the parliament in 1782, held it neceſſary formally to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize the executive power, to acknowledge the future exiſtence of this country, as a diſtinct political ſovereignty: and his miſſion was founded on that act of the parliament. Moreover, congreſs conſidered this unrelinquiſhed pretenſion, as ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant and proper an idea for them to provide againſt, that about the ſame time they reſolved, that ſuch an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ought to precede <hi>a negociation.</hi> From theſe facts on both ſides, it is clear, that the two parties, even while oppoſed in arms, were not preciſely in the ſituation of two alien hoſtile powers, different from, and unconnected with, each other, de <hi>jure,</hi> de <hi>lege,</hi> and de <hi>facto.</hi> Before the declaration of indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the laws of war had but a certain extent of operation, on account of the municipal laws: and it is important to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that Great Britain, to the laſt hour of the war, ſtrictly adhered to this idea in her deportment towards the United States and to foreign nations, who aided them. Wherefore, as ſhe had ſome conſiderable advantages in the conteſt, from that principle, ſhe cannot regularly ſet it aſide, in order to apply the laws of <hi>"booty"</hi> of war, to this property of the other party, which was not acquired by military means. It has been obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ſhe did not deliver up ſhips in conſequence of the treaty, and no doubt this very principle, conſtituted a part of her reaſons; ſhe, conſidering the veſſels of the United States as condemnable for breaches of the ſtatutes paſſed by her parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to ſhut the American ports and prohibit intercourſe. Private ſhips and cargoes were conſtantly condemned on the ground of thoſe municipal laws, or the laws of the empire, as ſhe held them, and not upon the laws of war and of nations.</p>
                     <p>Here it appears neceſſary, to notice by the way, an inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertent, but material incorrectneſs in a writer on the treaty, wherein ſhips are mentioned as the only ſpecies of property, which does not become booty to an enemy, by the mere capture or acquiring of poſſeſſion. It cannot be doubted, that all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty whatever compoſing the <hi>cargoes</hi> of ſhips, all <hi>money</hi> and <hi>baggage</hi> of paſſengers, all <hi>paſſenger ſlaves,</hi> being the ſervants of paſſengers or of the ſhip's officers, and <hi>all ſlaves</hi> who are <hi>mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
                        <pb n="90" facs="unknown:028389_0377_0FD8EAE4D59C2290"/>or <hi>a part of the crew</hi> of the ſhip, muſt be libelled and condemned, in a court of admiralty, and cannot be held by the laws of booty. There is one deſcription of property, which has never yet been ſeized or retained by any civilized power, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taken by land or ſea; and that is, ſervants or apprentices, bound for terms of years. Yet Lord Dunmore's proclamation is believed to have extended to bound white perſons. It would be particularly painful and inconvenient to Great Britain, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially on the breaking out of a war, if the time of ſervice of the numerous apprentices on board her private ſhips, which terms of time are the fair and actual property of their maſters, ſhould be libelled in the courts of admiralty, of a foreign country, and decreed to be the lawful property of the captors. This may place in a clearer light, <hi>the mighty evils</hi> which may be induced by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying <hi>the legal relations,</hi> ſubſiſting between perſons in the ſame civil ſociety, by a military proclamation, reſorted to by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive power in a domeſtic quarrel, or by a foreign enemy in an ordinary war. To take apprentices and bound ſervants on land, and to make the right of their time of ſervice "booty" of war, would extend the evil, though it accords with the principle of the Britiſh proclamation. To tranſmit ſuch procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations into countries remote from the reach of arms, offering freedom from their indentures, to all ſuch ſervants and appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, as ſhould leave their maſters' houſes, thereby diſſolving the bands of ſociety, and the exiſting municipal laws of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, would lead, in a few years, to modes of warfare, which would immenſely increaſe its dreadful calamities.</p>
                     <p>There exiſted formerly in the kingdom of Great Britain it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, a deſcription of ſlaves, well known to lawyers by the name of <hi>Villeins.</hi> Theſe ſlaves were ſubject to the laws of real eſtates, and not to the rules of diſtribution concerning perſonal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. They were included among the hereditaments of that day. This is conceived to be an important circumſtance to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance the general ſoundneſs of the idea, that a Britiſh commiſſioner could reaſonably deem ſlaves to be perſonal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty.</p>
                     <p>The conduct of ſovereigns holding ſlave countries, may be conſidered as important on this ſubject. In the numerous and frequent wars between the European nations, having Weſt India colonies, the meaſure of emancipating the blacks had never been adopted, as a proper and juſtiſiable mode of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. It is not irrelative to this argument to remark, that Mr. Oſwald was a grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Further: A circuſtance of great importance indeed to Great Britain and her ſlave colonies, in relation to this very deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of property, was pending during the time of the American negociation at Paris. A number of valuable Weſt India iſlands had been taken by the French from the Britiſh in and between the years. 1778 and 1782. Theſe were, St. Kitts, Grenada, the Grenadines, St. Vincents, Tobago, Dominica, Nevis and Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerat. To theſe may be added, New Providence and the Baha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, taken by Spain. Many of the ſlaves on thoſe iſlands, by the arguments offered againſt the United States, were <hi>"booty."</hi> Their caſe was that of <hi>capture</hi> before the capitulations or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a capitulation, in ordinary war between two diſtinct ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns, not commenced by an unlawful attempt to aboliſh a legal intereſt by an act of a ſecondary executive magiſtrate, and continued by military commanders and others, infringing the legiſlative juriſdiction, if their juriſdiction extended to ſuch an act for the conſideration moving thereto. It is poſſible, that the apprehenſion of ſo embarraſſing a difficulty, and ſo deep an injury to the Britiſh Weſt India iſlands, which were to be reſtored, may have contributed to influence the Britiſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner to be ſilent about impediments to the American claim to <hi>"ary"</hi> of the negroes. Certain it is, that Great Britain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived extenſive advantages from the circumſtance of the negroes on the reſtored iſlands, not being conſidered as booty; and equally certain it is, and highly meriting the candid conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Great Britain, as to the paſt and <hi>future,</hi> that the deeply indebted planters of thoſe iſlands, could not have paid their debts to their Britiſh creditors, had conſiderable numbers of their negroes been kept from them upon the plea, that they were booty to the armies of France.</p>
                     <p>It is of very great importance to this American claim, and to the argument in favor of the United States, that the laws ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting in regard to the whole body of the negro ſlaves belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Great Britain, at the time of the preliminary treaty of peace, conſidered them in the light of real eſtate. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended with the lands to the heir, and were ſubject to the laws of dower, as lands. They were not put on the ſame footing as perſonal property. The laws of Jamaica, Antigua, and Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, are here referred to. Thoſe iſlands were the greateſt and moſt reſpectable Britiſh Weſt India colonies, having, by accre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited accounts, in 1782, near 300, 000 ſlaves. It is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that of all the Weſt India iſlands, thoſe three alone, remained to Great Britain on the 20th November, 1782; all the reſt and the Florida ſlave colonies, were taken by the French and Spaniards. The captured iſlands were returned in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:028389_0379_0FD8EAED0A7FFD00"/>general terms; and in numerous inſtances, the queſtion of ſlaves being booty, and the right of carrying the ſlaves away, might have been raiſed by the French and Spaniards, upon the principles now urged by Great Britain, againſt the United States.</p>
                     <p>It is likewiſe of ſome conſequence on this ſubject, that the French colonial laws, which were founded on <hi>the cuſtoms of the city of Paris,</hi> contemplated this new deſcription of property, in certain reſpects, with ſome of the ideas attached to immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able property. The plantations and negroes <hi>thereon,</hi> of perſons dying inteſtate, veſted in the heirs, and could not be ſold during their minority. But the goods and chattels (as we call them) could be ſold. It is alſo underſtood, that they were diſtinguiſhed by the laws concerning dower, ſettlements, and the return of eſtates of perſons, dying without iſſue, to the ſource, from which they came to the deceaſed.</p>
                     <p>Some ideas concerning the right of <hi>poſlliminium</hi> appear to have an important relation to this caſe. Upon the foundation of that right, the Roman law (the parent ſtock of the civil law and law of nations) treated ſlaves, taken in war, in a manner op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to that in which things, now called perſonal property, were treated. They were not ſubject to the rules of booty, which worked a change of property by the mere acquiring of poſſeſſion, as is the caſe with reſpect to thoſe things at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent termed goods and chattels; but ſlaves were returned, like real eſtates, contrary to thoſe rules, to their former own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, on a pacification. This idea in the ancient law of nations (with the laws of villeinage) has no doubt had ſome influence in fixing the practice of leaving the proprietors of the captured Weſt India iſlands in poſſeſſion of their ſlaves, in all caſes wherein their lands were not confiſcated. Although the iſlands of. Grenada and the Grenadines were conquered, without a capitulation, by France, in 1778, no pretence was ſet up by the French on returning thoſe iſlands at the peace of 1783, according to the treaty, that the ſlaves were retainable and might be carried away by them as <hi>"booty"</hi> of war, becauſe not included in the words, which returned the territory. The poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the property in a captured ſlave remains to an owner, ſo as to give a ſufficient foundation to claim him in caſe he ſhall be in the firſt owner's country at the cloſe of the war, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the greateſt countenance from the ancient law of nations, and from the recent proceedings thereunder between Great Britain and her ordinary enemies. Wherefore, it ſeems that the proclamation of Lord Dunmore is as deſtitute of ſupport from

                        </gap>he law of nations, and the practice thereon, as from the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipal ſtatutes of his former government.</p>
                     <p>There ſtill exiſt, unhappily, <hi>throughout the world,</hi> too many inſtances of perpetual and hereditary ſlavery. <hi>No quarter of the globe is entirely free from it.</hi> Whatever may be the virtuous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of many individuals and of ſeveral nations, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that this painful practice cannot be ended in a day; nor would too ſudden an abolition promote the comfort of thoſe unhappy men. While it is permitted to continue, it will add infinitely to the miſery of ſlaves, if they are to be conſidered hereafter, like the cattle on a farm, as capable of becoming <hi>booty</hi> in war; and it muſt ſubject to diſtraction and utter ruin, all thoſe vulnerable and defenceleſs iſlands and colonies, in which theſe unhappy people form a large majority of the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                     <p>On a calm review of the grounds of this American claim upon Great Britain, it will appear, that the acquiſition of the blacks by the Britiſh forces was commenced and largely exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by an unprecedented act of a civil governor, <hi>contrary to the laws of the land</hi> by which he was bound; that it was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued by unprecedented acts of the Britiſh military commanders, contrary to <hi>the law and uſage of notions,</hi> by which they were bound—that any deſcription of property thus <hi>irregularly</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired againſt the municipal law and the law of nations, could neither have been rendered the property of the acquirers, nor capable of being diſpoſed of by them, nor capable of being retained by them; but that it ought to have been reſtored by them, even if it were, ſtrictly ſpeaking, perſonal property; and that conſequently, had it been indiſputably of that deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it could not have been carried away, becauſe of the manner in which it was obtained. It will alſo appear, that a majority of the deſcription of property in queſtion was held, in the United States, as real and inheritable eſtate, conſequently not ſubject to the laws of booty; that this was particularly the caſe throughout the whole of the late juriſdiction of the earl of Dunmore; that the ancient law of England made the <hi>villein</hi> or <hi>Engliſh ſlave</hi> likewiſe inheritable eſtate, and paſſed him like the lands; that the laws of all the remaining. Britiſh Weſt India iſlands in 1782, contemplated the negroes as real eſtate; that the French colonial laws conſidered them, in ſeveral very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant particulars, like immoveable property; that the ancient Romans held them to be, like lands, within the laws of poſtlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium, in oppoſition to the rules concerning "booty" in war; that the <hi>preſcriptive law of nations,</hi> as eſtabliſhed by the practice of Great Britain, France, Spain, &amp;c. reſtored them after war, as
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:028389_0381_0FD8EAF34349C430"/>and with real eſtates, not only in capitulating iſlands, conquered from each other, but even, as in the caſe of Grenada and the Grenadines, <hi>in iſlands conquered unconditionally, or without capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation;</hi> that therefore, <hi>by thoſe general pre-eſtabliſhed rules,</hi> both written and preſcriptive, which bound the French not to carry away the negroes from the reſtored Britiſh iſlands, eſpecially from Grenada and the Grenadines, the Britiſh were bound not to carry away from the United States any negroes, which were acquired from the Americans, even if nothing had been ſaid of negroes of other property in the treaty of peace.</p>
                     <p>It is moreover hoped, ſir, that it has been made to appear to have been the real intention and meaning of both parties to the treaty of peace, that no negroes ſhould be carried away. This is evidenced, it is conceived, by the repreſentations, before and at the moment, of the American commiſſioners, and by the omiſſion of counter repreſentations, and the conſequently implied acquieſcence of the Britiſh commiſſioner; likewiſe by the words of the treaty itſelf in regard to the negroes, fairly conſtrued and interpreted by the rules drawn from reaſon and the law of nations, and ſupported by ſimilar proviſions, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the American artillery, archives, papers, &amp;c. and laſtly, this idea of the meaning of the parties appears to be rendered neceſſary and inevitable by the impoſſibility of finding any other meaning, which either party could think it uſeful or proper to make the ſubject matter of a ſtipulation.</p>
                     <p>How far this meaſure of the Britiſh commanders, if really contrary to the law of nations and to the treaty of peace, is the firſt fact of the nature of an infraction on either ſide, and how far it ought to be compenſated, if it was an infraction of the law of nations or of the treaty, though it ſhould prove not to have been the firſt breach of the treaty, remains to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>

                  <head type="sub">No. III.</head>
                  <p>THE 7th reaſon is, "Becauſe the commerce we have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto enjoyed in India, in common with other nations, is ſo reſtricted, that in future it will be of little or no ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial benefit to our citizens."</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, it ought to be remarked, that, according to the rights claimed by all nations, having colonies, to which all other nations have acceded, we have no poſitive right to go to any of the colonies of the Britiſh crown; and that, unleſs ſuch right is obtained by treaty, the Britiſh may inhibit our trading, or even entering the ports of their colonial poſſeſſions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out affording any juſt cauſe of complaint. The right of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining the trade of colonies to the parent country, and exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all ſtrangers from any participation therein, is as old and as univerſal, as any claimed by the preſent commercial nations of Europe.</p>
                  <p>By our treaty with France, his moſt chriſtian majeſty agrees to continue to the ſubjects of the United States, the free ports which have been and are open in the French iſlands of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica: in all of which free ports the ſaid ſubjects ſhall enjoy the ſame agreeably to the regulations which relate to them.</p>
                  <p>An arret of the king of France, on the 30th of Auguſt, 1784, declares the free ports in the iſlands of America, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations they ſhall be ſubject to—the ſize of veſſels—the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles they may carry in, and bring away. The veſſels are to be ſixty tons at the leaſt, and the merchandizes, wood, ſalt, beef, fiſh, rice, maize, vegetables, ſkins, furs, roſin, pitch and tar. Salt beef and fiſh are ſubjected to a duty of three livres per quintal, beſide the general duties on the cargo: which three livres are converted into a bounty on the French fiſhery. The articles, permitted to be taken away in return, were limited to taſſia and melaſſes—and goods imported there from France. Commiſſioners were to be appointed to reſide in theſe free ports, to ſee that the regulations were ſtrictly complied with; and the more ſecurely to guard the trade, the merchants and captains of veſſels, reſiding in thoſe ports, were authorized to chooſe from among themſelves, commiſſioners who ſhould aſſiſt in watching the foreign veſſels and denouncing negligencies. By our treaty with the United Netherlands, it is is expreſsly
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:028389_0383_0FD8EAF932CE7070"/>agreed, "that the United States, their ſubjects and inhabitants, ſhall leave to thoſe of their high mightineſſes, the peaceable enjoyment of their rights in the countries, iſlands, and ſeas, in the Eaſt and Weſt Indies, without any hindrance or moleſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on." It appears, then, that the right of excluding foreigners from a direct trade to their colonies, and confining the trade of the coloniſts to the mother country, is not only practiſed among all the European nations, but has been expreſsly recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized by the United States of America. Hence it clearly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that every relaxation of the colonial ſyſtem muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a favor to that nation, in whoſe behalf it is ſo relaxed. This uſed to be our reaſoning on the arret of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he king of France, admitting us, in common with other foreigners, into the Weſt Indies, however limited in the tonnage of the veſſels, and in the cargoes permitted to be imported and exported.</p>
                  <p>This is conſidered to be the permanent ſtate of things. In times of great ſcarcity in the iſlands, they have been free for the importation of certain other articles. In times of war, the French have generally opened their colonies to all foreigners, becauſe it is more important to have their ſeamen on board their ſhips of war, than be the ſole ſuppliers and carriers for their colonies. During the laſt war, in the year 1779, the French opened the trade of their Weſt India iſlands to neutral nations: the conſequences were alarming to the merchants of France; and repreſentations were made againſt the meaſure from Bourdeaux, Nantz, and other large towns; and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately on ſigning the preliminary articles of peace, this permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to neutral nations was withdrawn.</p>
                  <p>The ſame was done at the Havannah. While Louiſburg and Canada were colonies of France, they were not allowed a direct trade to the Weſt Indies. And ſuch has been the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy of European nations reſpecting their colonies, that Franc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> once paſſed a decree, ordering the governors of their Weſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia colonies to ſeize and confiſcate ſhips and cargoes coming within a league of the ſhores of their iſlands.</p>
                  <p>The right we enjoy, without treaty, of going into the Britiſh Eaſt Indies, is merely permiſſive in that nation. The trade has been but of few years.—Lord Sheffield, in his argument againſt admitting the Americans into the Weſt India iſlands, remarks, "That the Americans have no more pretenſions to go to our Weſt India iſlands, than to our Eaſt India ſettlements; yet the latter would be thought a very extraordinary ſtep."</p>
                  <p>The ſentiments of this writer have been much adopted by the Britiſh government, relative to their Weſt Indies, ſince the revolution, and may, therefore, give us ſome idea what that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:028389_0384_0FD8EAFD34C189F8"/>thinks of our right to a commerce with their Eaſt India ſettlements. If Great Britain ſhould refuſe to admit our veſſels into her Eaſt India poſſeſſions, it would be no juſt cauſe of complaint on the part of the United States. France and Spain, as has been ſhown, opened the trade of ſome of their colonies, during the laſt war, to all neutral nations; and immediately on return of peace, that trade was again confined to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent countries. Neither the United States, nor any other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who had enjoyed the benefits of this free trade, pretended to claim a continuance, becauſe it had been permitted to them, or to deny the authority of theſe two nations to prohibit them entering their colonial poſſeſſions, much leſs to make complaint at being denied a privilege, before indulged to them.</p>
                  <p>Having, then, no rights of commerce in the Britiſh Eaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which that nation may not take from us, without juſt cauſe of complaint on our part, let us conſider what are the reſtrictions impoſed on the trade by treaty, and whether it will not continue to be a ſubſtantial benefit to our citizens, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe reſtrictions.</p>
                  <p>By the 13th article, there is an expreſs ſtipulation on the part of the Britiſh king, that we ſhall freely carry on a trade with the Britiſh Eaſt Indies, paying a tonnage duty on our veſſels, no higher than Britiſh veſſels pay in American ports, and no higher duties on the importation and exportation of their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes, than ſhall be payable on the ſame articles, when import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or exported in Britiſh veſſels; the articles exported to be carried to the United States, and there unladen; and both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whenever it ſhall be found neceſſary, ſhall adopt ſuch regulations as ſhall be neceſſary to the due obſervance of this ſtipulation.</p>
                  <p>Two queſtions ariſe on this part of the article—firſt, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the trade to be abſolutely confined to the carrying of merchandiſe of any ſort, not abſolutely prohibited, to the Britiſh Eaſt Indies, and the importing from thoſe ſettlements, directly into the United States, all articles not abſolutely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited.</p>
                  <p>Is a trade, thus limited, ſubſtantially beneficial? We muſt either procure the produce of that country, directly from the Eaſt Indies, making payment there, in ſuch articles as ſhall be convenient for us to carry, and ſuited to their market, or we muſt buy them in Europe, and pay for them there.</p>
                  <p>Taking for granted, then, that there is no profit on the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go carried to the Eaſt Indies (though ſometimes very great profits are made on the outward cargo) let it be conſidered, that, in the firſt place, we procure all our Eaſt India goods at
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:028389_0385_0FD8EB009CC1FFE0"/>the firſt coſt, from the hands of the producer. In the latter, they are purchaſed with all the additional charges of freight to Europe, commiſſions, and profits of every man concerned in procuring them in India, ſending them to Europe, and ſelling them there; and when it is remembered, that the trade from Europe is excluſively veſted in companies, which pay an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe ſum for this monopoly, and is at vaſt expenſe for the ſupport of military and civil eſtabliſhments, to ſecure their trade and poſſeſſions, and the orderly management of their concerns; all which muſt be charged on the goods, before they are ſold in Europe; it cannot be doubted, that the direct trade to and from the Britiſh Eaſt Indies, will continue to be ſubſtantially beneficial. Indeed, it is a well authenticated fact, that Eaſt India goods are twenty-five per cent. cheaper in the United States than in Europe; and, if imported from Europe by us, the charge muſt be made of at leaſt ten per cent. more, which would ariſe for commiſſions and exchange. It is clear, then, that we ſhould procure our Eaſt India goods from thirty to forty per centum cheaper, under this article, than without the permiſſion to go to the Eaſt Indies, which it ſecures to us; the difference may be fairly called a ſubſtantial benefit to our citizens. This is the caſe in times of peace; in time of war the difference will be greater, the charges in Europe being greatly accumulated by war-freight and inſurance.</p>
                  <p>The other queſtion that ariſes on this article, is, are we, that is to ſay, both nations, conſtrained to keep this trade thus limited? Has not Britain the power to grant, and the United States the capacity to exerciſe, the right of carrying Eaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia goods to Europe, if both parties conſent? When two make a contract, in which no other is intereſted; may they not diſſolve it, if both pleaſe? If diſſolve it, may they not grant to each other larger and greater benefits than are ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the contract? Does ſtipulating to grant a right, by an individual or a nation, preclude a power to extend that right, or grant or permit the exerciſe of others? Is there any moral or natural incapacity in the United States, to receive an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the commerce, granted in that article? Is there any in Great Britain to grant? The anſwer muſt be clear, and will readily ſhow, that the having certain rights, by expreſs ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cannot interfere with the grant or permiſſion of others.</p>
                  <p>Has any other power a right, then, to prohibit Britain from permitting, and America from exerciſing, other rights? It is not pretended there is any.</p>
                  <p>If the treaty is ratified, and Great Britain ſhall chooſe to demand of us to make ſuch regulations as will inſure to them,
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:028389_0386_0FD8EB0234C33F78"/>that the veſſels of the United States ſhall carry the goods laden in the Eaſt Indies, to the United States, and there unlade them, we ſhall be bound to do it. But as this is a ſtipulation on our part, and for her benefit, if ſhe chooſes to wave it, and clear out our veſſels from her ports for Europe, they will have a right to go there. The cuſtom houſe clearance would be an expreſs conſent on her part, and our right could not be conteſted by any one.</p>
                  <p>A miſtake of the treaty, has induced ſome people to ſuppoſe there are more reſtrictions on this trade, than is fairly warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the article.</p>
                  <p>It has been ſuppoſed, that the coaſting trade of India, now enjoyed, is henceforth abſolutely interdicted. The words are, "it is alſo underſtood, that the permiſſion granted by this arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, is not to extend to allow the veſſels of the United States to carry on any part of the coaſting trade of the Britiſh territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries." The legal, natural import of theſe words is, by virtue of this article, no right ſhall be claimed to the coaſting trade of the Britiſh territories in India. The words are intended to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a right by implication; which the generality of the terms, expreſſing our authority to trade there, might be conſtrued to include. It certainly takes away no right drawn from other clauſes. If a right to the coaſting trade of India, can be founded on other principles, or derived from other ſources; this article certainly does not infringe that right: for the words are, "that the permiſſion granted by this article, is not to extend," &amp;c. We are ſurely then in poſſeſſion of all the rights we were enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled to without the treaty.</p>
                  <p>Great Britain, unleſs the treaty is ratified, may reſtrict us from the coaſting trade of her territories in India, and alſo from all trade there, even that of direct importation and expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. If the treaty is ratified, ſhe will poſſeſs, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, the right ſhe had before, and no greater, to prohibit us from that coaſting trade; but ſhe will not poſſeſs a right to refuſe us the direct trade of importation and exportation from her Eaſt India ſettlements. Before the treaty is ratified, ſhe may permit to our veſſels the coaſting trade—after it is ratified, ſhe may permit the ſame.</p>

The 8th reaſon offered by the town againſt ratifying the treaty, is, "Becauſe in every ſtipulation reſpecting our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the colonial poſſeſſions of Great Britain, the whole commerce of the United States, in ſuch intercourſe, is colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized in return."</p>
                  <p>The writer of theſe remarks is at a l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſs to comprehend the preciſe meaning of the town in this reaſon. Does it mean that if we are permitted to trade with the colonies of Great Britain, we can trade with thoſe colonies only, or that we cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the articles we obtain there, from the United States to any other country?</p>
                  <p>Some nations have ſurrendered the whole commerce of their colonies to an excluſive company; others, without eſtabliſhing an excluſive company, have confined the whole commerce of their colonies to a particular part of the mother country—whence no ſhip was allowed to ſail, but either m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>fleet, and at a particular ſeaſon; or, if ſingle, in conſequence of a licenſe. Other nations leave the trade of their colonies free to all their ſubjects, who may carry it on from all the different parts of the mother country, and who have occaſion for no other licenſe than the common diſpatches of the cuſtom houſe.</p>
                  <p>This is an account of the conduct of parent countries to their colonies, by the celebrated Adam Smith, in his treatiſe on the wealth of nations. Anderſon, in his origin of commerce, ſpeaking on the ſame ſubject ſays, "By every principle of juſtice, of the law of nations, and the cuſtoms of the other powers of Europe, who had ſettlements and di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ant dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, the mother country had an excluſive right to trade with, and to forbid all others from having any intercourſe with them. Such an excluſive right cannot be denied to be the very eſſence of colonization."</p>
                  <p>The above quotations are made for the purpoſe of obtaining a clear idea of the rights of nations having colonies, and the obligations and reſtrictions of ſuch colonies; that by examining the ſtate of our commerce under the treaty, we may conclude, whether, conformable to any juſt idea affixed to the terms, "co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonizing commerce." it can be truly ſaid, "that the whole commerce of the United States in ſuch intercourſe is colonized in return." By colonizing commerce muſt then probably be underſtood, reſtricting commerce to a particular country, and particular people.</p>
                  <p>The 3d and 13th articles of the treaty appear to be the only ones that reſpect our trade to the Britiſh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

<pb n="101" facs="unknown:028389_0388_0FD8EB07689E8B58"/>We are ſtill free to procure the like articles, from any other part of the world—and what we bring from thoſe colonies, we may export wherever we pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>There is no reſtriction as to the articles to be imported into their colonies, or exported from them by us, nor as to the place to which we may export the articles, ſo brought from them.</p>
                  <p>The coloniſts may come into the United States, in the ſame manner, and for the ſame purpoſes, as we enter their territories: but there is no reſtriction that we will ſell only to them; or which gives to them any excluſive privilege, that the ſame rights granted to them by treaty, we are not free to grant to all the world.</p>
                  <p>The 13th article gives us a right to trade to the Eaſt Indies; but contains no contract, that we will not buy elſewhere, the like articles, that we procure from their ſettlements—neither does it ſay, that they ſhall have the excluſive privilege of trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with us—and the merchandizes brought into the United States, from thoſe ſettlements, are as free to be exported to any part of the world, as though that article did not exiſt—There does not appear any thing like that ſort of reſtriction on us, or excluſive right to them, that can juſtify the terms, "colonizing the whole commerce of the United States, in ſuch intercourſe, in return."</p>
                  <p>The 9th reaſon given by the town, is, "Becauſe the clauſe by which the Britiſh government reſerves to itſelf the right of impoſing on American veſſels, entering Britiſh ports in Europe, a duty which ſhall countervail the difference of the duty paya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on the importation of European and Aſiatic goods, into the United States, in Britiſh or American bottoms, places it in the power of that government, to enable Britiſh ſubjects to become the importers of Aſiatic and European goods, into the United States, to the excluſion of our own citizens."</p>
                  <p>It is really difficult to comprehend how the reſervation here mentioned, can be attended with the conſequences ſuggeſted by the town.</p>
                  <p>If our veſſels enter their ports on equal terms as we permit their veſſels to enter ours, it is hard to conceive, that we ſhould be the loſers—we make a rule, which the treaty ſuppoſes more againſt them than the rule by which they aſſeſs our veſſels. It is not probable that a nation of equal power, would conſent to terms manifeſtly unequal; neither is it reconcileable with the common principles of equity and juſtice, for a nation to object to that part of the bargain, which reſerves equal rights. At any rate, it may be fairly ſtated, that it is no objection to the treaty;
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:028389_0389_0FD8EB090FFDB060"/>for it gives Great Britain no new powers on this ſubject. She poſſeſſes a right of countervailing the difference mentioned, without any aid of the treaty—and may exerciſe it whenever ſhe pleaſes. By the treaty ſhe obligates herſelf to impoſe no higher duties on our veſſels, than ſhe does on thoſe of all other nations.</p>
                  <p>The 10th reaſon is, "Becauſe, although the terms of ſaid treaty appear to be reciprocal in many inſtances; yet, from the local ſituation and circumſtances of the United States, and the pacific ſyſtem of policy they have adopted, that reciprocity is merely nominal and deluſive."</p>
                  <p>The town leaves the world to conjecture what are the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences flowing from the local ſituation and circumſtances of the United States, and the pacific ſyſtem they have adopted, that render the reciprocity purported by the terms of ſaid treaty, to be merely nominal and deluſive. Perhaps the preſident may ſee them from the aſſertion of the town; but ſurely it was due from the town to the people of the United States, to point out the deluſion which had been overlooked by the miniſter and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the United States. Not being able to detect this deluſion without further light, the writer muſt paſs over this reaſon, with a requeſt to his readers, that they would not aſſent to this aſſertion, without examining the treaty for themſelves, and at leaſt, deſiring the committee or ſelectmen of Boſton, to expoſe the fraud before they paſs cenſure on their whole go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, for being deluded blockheads, or ſomething worſe.</p>
                  <p>The firſt part of the 11th reaſon is, "Becauſe it prevents the United States from impoſing any further reſtrictions on the Britiſh trade alone."</p>
                  <p>If it were not the town of Boſton, ſo reſpectable for wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and good ſenſe, that offered this reaſon, one would hardly ſuſpect that the reaſon originated in any thing, but a diſpoſition to prevent all pacific arrangements with that nation. For no one will believe, that Britain, or any other nation, who is not an humble, vanquiſhed ſuppliant—would ever conſent to make a treaty, by which ſhe ſhould place us on the ſame terms as the moſt favored nations; and we reſerve to ourſelves the right to treat her, on terms leſs favorable than we do others. In our treaty with France, the United Netherlands, Sweden, and Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, we have reciprocally agreed to place each other on ſuch terms. It is not wonderful that Mr. Jay could not induce the Britiſh nation, to bind themſelves to treat us, as well as they do others, and leave us at liberty to treat them worſe than we do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </head>
                  <p>IT has been ſaid, by a writer much admired, that "howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver uſeful jealouſy may be in republics, yet when, like bile in the natural, it abounds too much in the body politic; the eyes of both become very liable to be deceived by the deluſive appearances which the malady caſts on ſurrounding objects." From this cauſe, probably, have proceeded many of the fears and apprehenſions excited by the treaty.</p>
                  <p>The ſpeech in queſtion begins with a violent attack on the preſident, for having committed two breaches of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the one in having appointed the chief juſtice of the United States, envoy extraordinary to Great Britain; the other in hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given him inſtructions, reſpecting a treaty, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting the ſenate.</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt, No part of the conſtitution is quoted to ſhow that the appointment of Mr. Jay infringed it: but an inference is drawn from a ſuppoſed inconſiſtency in ſending a man to negociate a treaty, reſpecting which he might be called on to give a judicial opinion. This objection might as well have applied to his origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal appointment as chief juſtice, having previouſly negociated a treaty, reſpecting which he might be called upon to give an opinion from the bench. The objection would be as good againſt appointing any man a judge who had ever negociated a treaty, as againſt appointing any man a negociator who had been a judge. Perhaps the objection would be as ſtrong againſt placing
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:028389_0391_0FD8EB0C3ADC7758"/>on the bench any man who had publicly expreſſed an opinion on a treaty, which he might be required to conſider as judge, or a member of the legiſlature who had been concerned in making a law, which he might afterwards, as judge, be called upon to expound, or, in ſhort, a hundred other ſuch caſes. Had there been a <hi>conſtitutional incompatibility,</hi> in that caſe, the inſtant Mr. Jay accepted his commiſſion as envoy, he would have ceaſed to be chief juſtice; becauſe, where the conſtitution creates an incompatibility, it vacates inſtantly one office, by the acceptance of the other. Either, therefore, there was an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patibility, or there was not. If there was, then the inſtant Mr. Jay accepted his commiſſion as envoy, he ceaſed to be chief juſtice; and all the noiſe about <hi>ſending the chief juſtice,</hi> was idle and ridiculous; if there was no incompatibility, then all the noiſe about violating the conſtitution, was equally idle and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous. Was there a greater violation of the conſtitution in taking one of the judicial department to be an envoy, than one of the legiſlature? yet Mr. <hi>Monroe, being ſenator,</hi> was appointed miniſter to France. The conſtitution is ſilent about both; the inconſiſtency applied equally to both: But there was not a whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of diſapprobation at the appointment of the latter. Perſonal, and not public motives, account for this difference. Mr. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe, indeed, reſigned his office of ſenator, <hi>after his appointment:</hi> Mr. Jay might have done the ſame. <hi>At the time</hi> of the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſame objection applied to both; it depended on the diſcretion of both, to reſign or not. Laſt year, the governor of Pennſylvania ſent the chief juſtice of that ſtate as a ſpecial en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy or commiſſioner, to negociate terms of peace with the inſurgents, and to make a treaty or convention, reſpecting which he might be called upon, as chief juſtice, to give an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion from the bench. The preſident, at the ſame time, ſent one of the judges of the ſupreme court of Pennſylvania, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the ſame miſſion: not a ſyllable of diſapprobation was uttered againſt either appointment. The probable evils which have been threatened by the chief juſtice of the United States remaining on the bench, after negociating the treaty, are done away; for he has actually reſigned.</p>
                  <p n="2">2d, The preſident is charged with having violated the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution by withholding from the ſenate a knowledge of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions he gave to Mr. Jay. The ſpeech tells us, "that it was <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> by <hi>ſome</hi> of the members, that the preſident ought to have ſubmitted to them the <hi>whole of the buſineſs</hi> upon which Mr. Jay was to have been ſent; but a motion to that effect was brought forward and <hi>negatived:</hi>" The ſenate, who are certainly competent judges of their own rights, and not likely to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:028389_0392_0FD8EB1084CF0C70"/>them, then conceived they had no right to call on the preſident for the inſtructions. The ſpeech tells us, "that <hi>many</hi> of the members of the ſenate were of opinion, at that time, that Mr. Jay was ſent for the purpoſe of obtaining compenſation for the depredations in the Weſt Indies, to demand the delivery of the poſts, and the execution of the treaty of peace; and to require a ſtipulation that our veſſels ſhould not in future be lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſeizure or condemnation on any pretence;" and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion drawn, is, that thoſe and others, alone, were the ſubjects on which Mr. Jay was ſuppoſed by the ſenate to be ſent to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociate; and yet in another place it tells us, that a motion was made in the ſenate, to require the preſident to ſubmit the <hi>whole</hi> of the buſineſs upon which Mr. Jay was ſent; conſequently, the ſenate muſt have believed that <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſe</hi> were <hi>not</hi> the <hi>only objects,</hi> about which he was ſent. The ſpeech then lays down this doctrine, in poſitive terms, "that the conſtitution gives no power to the preſident to <hi>commence</hi> a negociation, withou previouſly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting his intentions and inſtructions to the ſenate, requiring their advice, and receiving their aſſent;" and the words of the conſtitution "to make treaties, by and with the advice and conſent of the ſenate," are the text for this ſtrange commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.</p>
                  <p>The extent of the poſition is, "that the preſident has no power to enter into any negociation whatever, without previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſulting the ſenate and receiving their opinion, advice, or aſſent, as well with reſpect to the neceſſity of ſuch a nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, as to the propriety of his inſtructions;" a poſition, inconſiſtent with the very principles of our conſtitution, as well as of every other among civilized nations; repugnant to the practice which has prevailed ſince the firſt operation of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent government, and to the practice which now prevails in France, where democratic principles are carried to the utmoſt extent; a poſition which would reduce the preſident from being the ſupreme executive of the union, to the mere organ and inſtrument of the ſenate.</p>
                  <p>By the conſtitution "<hi>the executive power</hi> is veſted in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of the United States." Were there no limitation to this power, in relation to treaties, there would reſult to the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, as ſuch, the power of making treaties. But the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in ſpecifying the powers of the preſident, has wiſely limited this power, and has declared, after mentioning the various duties of the preſident, ſome of which he may perform without the intervention of any other branch of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that "he ſhall have power, by and with the advice and conſent of the ſenate, <hi>to make treaties.</hi>"</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="106" facs="unknown:028389_0393_0FD8EB140A47D218"/>
This limitation of the executive power cannot be extended further than the clear import of the terms; it can apply only to the <hi>making</hi> of treaties, and not to <hi>the negociations</hi> which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede them. The preſident may, therefore, of his own mere motion, commence or enter on any negociation, and give what inſtructions he may think proper to his agent; but the nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, when completed, cannot conſtitute or make a treaty, which ſhall be obligatory on the nation, without the advice and conſent of the ſenate, that is, without they conſent to the treaty which he ſhall lay before them, and adviſe him to ratify it. This conſtruction is the juſt one, is conſiſtent with reaſon and propriety, has been the conſtruction put upon the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution by the ſenate themſelves, in all the treaties which have been made ſince the year 1789, under the preſent government, and is the practice eſtabliſhed even by the republic of France, where the committee of public ſafety, their preſent executive, without conſulting the convention, negociate with foreign pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and conclude treaties, which are afterwards laid before the convention, to be ratified, as appears by the report on the ſubject of negociations, by Cambaceres, lately publiſhed, and by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in the treaties with the grand duke of Tuſcany and the king of Pruſſia. A contrary conſtruction would be replete with difficulties and embarraſſments, which would nearly prevent the formation of any treaty, or would deprive our government, in its negociations, of thoſe advantages of ſecrecy, diſpatch, and the chance of events, which all other governments poſſeſs. The doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine laid down in the ſpeech is, that "no negociation can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced, no inſtruction can be given, without the previous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation and approbation of the ſenate." In order to teſt th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> doctrine by the touchſtone of reaſon, let us enquire into in operation. The ſenate conſiſts of thirty members and the vice-preſident of the United States, reſiding in various parts of the union, in New Hampſhire and Georgia, in Vermont and Kentucky, and, in a few years, will have members living in the province of Maine and in the South Weſtern Territory: this body has, like the other branch of the legiſlature, its ſtated annual ſeſſion, at the cloſe of which the members return to their reſpective homes and families. It is not a ſtationary privy council to the preſident, reſiding at the ſeat of government; and, except in the caſes of conſenting to treaties and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it has no executive duties whatever to perform; it is, by the conſtitution, a branch of the legiſlature; and is only added, as a reſtraint on the executive, in the two caſes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. Suppoſe, then, inſtructions ſubmitted to them by the preſident, in relation to a certain negociation, and approved
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:028389_0394_0FD8EB1599496768"/>and tranſmitted to Europe; various occurrences may, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately on their arrival, require a change in them; the loſs of a battle, the death of a king, the removal of a miniſter, or other circumſtances intervening, to change the preſent poſture and aſpect of affairs, may turn the tide of events, ſo as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire an entire change of inſtructions. As in the field, ſo in the cabinet, there are moments to be ſeized as they paſs, and they who preſide in either, ſhould be left in a capacity to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them: to diſcern and to profit by theſe tides in national affairs, is the buſineſs of thoſe who preſide over them. In all theſe caſes, ſhould the preſident be required to convene the ſenators, from the borders of the St. Croix to the St. Mary's, and from the Atlantic to the Ohio or lake Champlain, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſider and renew their inſtructions, it is evident, that the opportunity would be loſt; ſecrecy and diſpatch, ſo neceſſary in negociations, would be unattainable; and it would require ages to bring any treaty to a concluſion. Such a conſtruction would be a <hi>felo de ſe;</hi> for it would amount to this, that no treaties ſhould ever be made; which was certainly not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the conſtitution. So often and ſo eſſentially have we heretofore ſuffered, from the want of ſecrecy and diſpatch, that the conſtitution would have been inexcuſably defective, if no attention had been paid to thoſe objects. Thoſe matters which, in negociations, uſually require the moſt ſecrecy and the moſt diſpatch, are thoſe preparatory meaſures, which faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate the attainment of the objects of the negociation. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution has ſo wiſely diſpoſed of the power of making treaties, that, although the preſident muſt, in concluding them, have the conſent of the ſenate, yet he can, in the firſt inſtance, have every advantage which may be derived from diſpatch, ſecret intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, or change of events. Suppoſe, that, during the receſs of the ſenate, circumſtances in Europe were ſuddenly to exiſt, which would offer a moſt favorable opportunity for a treaty; if the preſident were reſtrained from even inſtructing our miniſters, on the ſubject of a future negociation, without convening the ſenate, the opportunity would be irrecoverably gone; and the doctrine goes all the length of this; for it precludes the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on any negociation whatever, without the previous and preciſe inſtructions of the ſenate.</p>
                  <p>Such would be the embarraſſments and dangers reſulting from that poſition; on the other hand, by leaving it to the executive to negociate, and to the executive and ſenate to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, every advantage is ſecured, every diſadvantage is avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for, if the ſenate do not approve of the treaty, they can reject it, and deſire the preſident to renew the negociations:
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:028389_0395_0FD8EB19A19B0AE8"/>and this can be no poſſible cauſe of war, as the ſpeech ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes; for foreign nations, with whom we negociate, will know that the articles, ſigned by the miniſter, are of no effect, until ratified by the preſident and ſenate; it is always expreſsly declared, that they ſhall not be binding, until ratified by the preſident and ſenate.</p>
                  <p>We find, then, by the conſtitution, that <hi>the executive power is veſted in the preſident;</hi> and I have advanced, that every power of an executive nature is incident to the preſident, where it reſults from the nature of the federal government, and is not limited and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricted by ſome ſpecial proviſion. The aſſociation of the ſenate with the preſident, in relation to this point, is limited <hi>merely</hi> to the <hi>making</hi> treaties, which are then the ſupreme law of the land; and does not extend to the entering on, or commencing negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are <hi>not</hi> the law of the land, but mere inſtruments of writing, mere obligations in embryo, which have no effect or validity, and do not become <hi>treaties,</hi> until approved by the ſenate. The difference between <hi>commencing a negociation</hi> and <hi>making or concluding a treaty,</hi> is too obvious to be queſtioned: the limitation, then, being confined to the making or conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the treaty, all the other preparatory powers reſult to the executive, as ſuch, by virtue of the conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>The opinion of congreſs in 1789, in an analogous caſe, where the interpoſition of the ſenate was much more plauſible than the preſent, may throw ſome light on this ſubject. A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition was introduced by a member, whoſe bias in favor of the moſt democratic principles is well known; in which the power was given to the preſident, of removing all executive officers at his mere will and pleaſure. It was objected to, on the idea, that as, by the conſtitution, the preſident could not appoint thoſe officers without the conſent of the ſenate, ſo it was intended by the conſtitution, that he could not diſplace them without the conſent of that body; the various inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies which would flow from this conſtruction were in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply enumerated; and it was urged, that, the conſtitution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſilent on that point, the power neceſſarily reſulted to the preſident, as the executive power, it being an executive truſt: on this principle, the motion paſſed both houſes, and is now the law of the land.</p>
                  <p>The right of the ſenate to adviſe the preſident to enter into a negociation, is a diſtinct queſtion, and not involved in the preſent conſideration, and, therefore, unneceſſarily introduced; the only queſtion, pertinent to the ſubject, is, whether he may commence a negociation, without their advice; and of this the preceding reflections leave no doubt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="109" facs="unknown:028389_0396_0FD8BE9B1E4ED9A0"/>
It is ſaid in the ſpeech, that the right given to the preſident, So nominate to offices, has already placed in the hands of one man, all the honors and offices of the government; and that this is an unexampled power in any thing that had even the appearance of a free government.</p>
                  <p>If this power is a ſalutary one, we ſhould rejoice at his p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing it; if a pernicious one, why did the convention give it? who is to blame, but thoſe who created it—who ſo much to blame, as thoſe who wiſhed his power to be out of the reach of the people for <hi>eight or ten</hi> years, inſtead of <hi>four?</hi> The conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſome ſay, without authority, preſented us a conſtitution which we were obliged to adopt or reject in toto, a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to bind us for ages: the preſident, by conſtitutional au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as has been ſhown, preſented to the ſenate a treaty, the moſt injurious part of which muſt expire in two or three years; which is the moſt culpable? if there are dangerous powers in the conſtitution, the convention, certainly, for cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating them, not the preſident for conforming to them. The nomination to offices is certainly a high truſt; but it may be queſtioned, whether it gives the influence attributed to it: where there is one <hi>appointment,</hi> there are often a dozen <hi>diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments</hi>—where one <hi>friend</hi> is made, a dozen <hi>enemies</hi> ſpring up—and human experience would juſtify us in ſuſpecting, that <hi>diſappointments</hi> will have created more <hi>enemies</hi> to the preſident, <hi>on this occaſion,</hi> than <hi>appointments</hi> have ever procured him <hi>friends.</hi> The remark, that the power is unexampled in any thing like a free government, is altogether erroneous. In Pennſylvania, the governor makes all appointments, except ſheriffs and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roners, without any countroul. In New York, the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor nominates nearly all officers to the council of appointment, conſiſting only of four members, and has beſides a caſting vote. In Maſſachuſetts, Vermont, and Maryland, the governor, with the conſent of the council, makes nearly all appointments.</p>
                  <p>The opinions of Mr. <hi>Jay,</hi> are next animadverted on, in the ſpeech, as diſqualifying him from being a proper envoy to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. If Mr. Jay's ſuppoſed partiality to that country, and ſuppoſed diſlike to France, were objections to his being ſent to Great Britain, undoubtedly Mr. Monroe's avowed partiality for France, and his avowed hatred of Great Britain, were at leaſt as powerful objections to <hi>his</hi> being ſent to France; yet Mr. Monroe was ſelected by the preſident, for that very reaſon, and the choice was generally approved of. It did not follow, that, becauſe Mr. Monroe would have been willing, <hi>in the ſenate,</hi> to have voted advantages to France, without any equivalent, that, in the execution of his truſt, <hi>as envoy,</hi> he would not
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:028389_0397_0FD8EB1CCCFEEB68"/>have ſtood out to ſecure us advantages by treaty; neither did it follow, that, becauſe Mr. Jay, like a conſcientious man, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his opinions, as a judge, when his duty required it, he would not forego his own opinions, and, in purſuance of his inſtructions, as an envoy, do the beſt he could for his country. inſtructions, as an envoy, do the beſt he could for his country. —According to the reaſoning in the ſpeech, Mr. Jay ſhould have been ſent to France, becauſe his diſlike to that country would have ſtimulated him to concede nothing to it, and to wring from it every thing he could; and Mr. Monroe to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, for ſimilar reaſons.—Others, however, who had more correct ideas on the ſubject, conceived, that this would have been an inverſion of the natural order of things, and of the accuſtomed courſe of diplomatic proceedings, which has been, to ſend to foreign courts perſons likely to be acceptable to them. Had Mr. Jay been ſent to France, and Mr. Monroe to England, the probability is, that both appointments would have given offence. More ſtreſs, however, is laid on Mr. Jay's ſuppoſed diſlike to France, than circumſtances would warrant. If Mr. Jay, in his negociations at Paris, in 1783, found the then miniſter, Count de Vergennes, diſpoſed to ſacrifice the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial intereſts of the United States, to the then over-bearing policy of France—and, ten years afterwards, found citizen Genet (in 1793) at Philadelphia, trampling under foot the authority of the preſident, and the independence of our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment—and, on both occaſions, expreſſed his diſapprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their attempts—it does not thenceforth follow, that he bears any diſlike to the French nation, or would be deſirous of engagements hoſtile to her intereſts. Indeed, the care with which it is expreſsly declared, in the treaty with Great Britain, that no part of it ſhall be conſtrued, in any reſpect, to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere with our former treaties, is a proof of a contrary diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; and one of the higheſt panegyrics which has ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared on Mr. Jay, is from a Frenchman, celebrated for his republicaniſm and patriotiſm, <hi>Briſſot.</hi> Neither does it follow, that opinions, expreſſed by individuals at home, would preclude them, on foreign embaſſies, from aſſerting claims, inconſiſtent with thoſe opinions; if ſo, <hi>Mr. Jefferſon</hi> would have been a more improper negociator than Mr. Jay, on one of the moſt important, and, to ſome, moſt offenſive parts of the treaty; for he had expreſsly and publicly recognized the right of the Britiſh nation to capture the property of their enemies <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> board our ſhips. But miniſters ſpeak the language of their employers, and are governed by their inſtructions, to which their own private opinions always yield: there can be no doubt, that Mr. Jefferſon would have exerted all his great talents to
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:028389_0398_0FD8EB1DCC7721B0"/>accompliſh that important point, of free ſhips making free goods, notwithſtanding he had acknowledged the law of nations to be otherwiſe. The remark, therefore, that Mr. Jay <hi>was devoted to the intereſts of the Britiſh,</hi> is an unfounded calumny againſt a man, who, however miſtaken he may have been, in ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing too much to the preſervation of peace, or however he may have under-rated our ſtrength, or over-rated that of the other party, or however miſinformed or uninformed he may have been, is believed, by all who know him, to poſſeſs a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of mind and an integrity of heart, which cannot be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the little attacks of private pique and reſentment, or diſappointed malignity; whatever opinions the public may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain of his talents, certainly his yielding the point "free ſhips not making free goods," which the ſpeech calls the worſt part of the treaty, will not place him on a worſe footing in the public eſtimation, in the event contemplated by the ſpeech, than his ſuppoſed competitor, Mr. Jefferſon, who explicitly abandoned that point, when ſecretary of ſtate, whoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans, in combination with all thoſe, whom Mr. Jay's ungra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious manners have ever offended, eagerly avail themſelves of the preſent clamour, to build up the reputation of the one on the ruins of that of the other.</p>

                  <p>THE committee appointed at a town meeting, legally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened on Friday laſt, to take into conſideration the treaty now pending between Great Britain and the United States, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reported their opinion thereon, it was Reſolved, That this meeting do approve ſaid report; that a fair copy be made out; that it be ſigned by the moderator, and that the town council of the town of Newport be requeſted to tranſmit the ſame to the preſident of the United States without delay, as the ſenſe of this meeting on ſaid treaty, together with this reſolve.</p>

                     <p>The committee, to whom was referred, by their fellow citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, the conſideration of the treaty of amity, commerce, and
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:028389_0399_0FD8EB226C5A1870"/>navigation, now pending between his Britannic majeſty and the United States, report, That they have conſidered the ſaid treaty with attention, and diſapprove of the ſame, for the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing reaſons:</p>
                     <p>Becauſe the detention of the weſtern poſts hath been very injurious to the United States, and for which no compenſation is contemplated in ſaid treaty.</p>
                     <p>Becauſe the 3d, 13th, 15th, and 17th articles of the treaty, which regulate the trade, commerce, and navigation between Great Britain and the United States, are moſt decidedly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to the former, and will be very deſtructive to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and navigation of the latter.</p>
                     <p>Becauſe the 4th and 5th articles render the boundaries of the United States, as ſettled by the treaty of 1783, doubtful, and may occaſion a great loſs of territory to the United States.</p>
                     <p>Becauſe the demands of Britiſh creditors are fully attended to, and their complaints redreſſed, agreeably to the ſtipulation of the treaty of 1783; whereas the claims of the American citizens, for property carried away, by the Britiſh, in violation of the ſame treaty, are paſſed over in ſilence.</p>
                     <p>Becauſe the mode pointed out for American citizens to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain compenſation for the ſpoliations committed on their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, is remote, expenſive, and uncertain; which in juſtice, we conceive, ought to have been immediate and complete; whilſt the ſtipulations for reſtitution to be made by the United States, for the property taken by privateers equipped in ſaid ſtates, or captured within the limits thereof, is ſpeedy and energetic.</p>
                     <p>Becauſe, by the 9th article, a privilege is beſtowed on the ſubjects of Great Britain, in expreſſion reciprocal, but, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the difference in the circumſtances of the two nations, wanting an equivalent, and invading the rights of individual ſtates.</p>
                     <p>Becauſe we think it impolitic, to give up by treaty, the power of attaching Britiſh property in the United States, in caſe of national differences and diſcontents.</p>
                     <p>Becauſe, in this treaty, certain articles of export are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as contraband of war and juſt objects of confiſcation, which, in our own treaties with other nations, are conſidered as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Becauſe the 23d and 24th articles are calculated to embroil the United States with the French republic, and will probably make our ſea-ports the ſcenes of riot and diſorder. They alſo ten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> to make a common cauſe between the United States and Great Britain, and to diſtreſs our allies.</p>

Becauſe no proviſion is made in the treaty to protect and ſecure our ſeamen, that valuable claſs of citizens, from being impreſſed into the Britiſh ſervice; and no ſtipulation is therein contained for the relief of thoſe now detained on board Britiſh ſhips of war.</p>
                     <p>Your committee would further obſerve, that the treaty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains many ſentences of doubtful conſtruction; that it is defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of the reciprocity, which ought to be the baſis of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts; that it is an infraction of the friendſhip and gratitude which the republic of France may juſtly claim from the United States, and that it may be ruinous to the agriculture, manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, and commerce, of the United States.</p>

                  <head>FROM THE BOSTON CHRONICLE. Obſervations on Treaties.</head>

                  </opener>
                  <p>I MUST requeſt the attention of the public, through the medium of your <hi>Chronicle,</hi> to the following paſſage in the federal conſtitution; it is in the 2d ſection of the ſixth article. It provides, "that this conſtitution and the laws of the United States, made in purſuance thereof, and all treaties <hi>made,</hi> or which <hi>ſhall</hi> be made, under the authority of the United States, ſhall be the ſupreme law of the land; and the judges, in every ſtate, ſhall be bound thereby, any thing in the conſtitution or laws of <hi>any ſtate,</hi> to the contrary, notwithſtanding."</p>
                  <p>It muſt be viſible, from this paſſage, that treaties ſtand pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely on the <hi>ſame</hi> footing with <hi>other</hi> laws, and have no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority <hi>over</hi> them. They are ſupreme, nor as they refer to the
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:028389_0401_0FD8EB278A491268"/>federal conſtitution, but ſimply in their relation to the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions and laws of any ſtate; and the judges are directed thus to conſider them. How far they may be extended, ſo as to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the local conſtitution, is a very delicate queſtion, and of great importance to be conſidered; for if their power extends to the full length which the preſident ſeems to ſuppoſe, in his anſwer to the town of Boſton, there is not a government in the union, the conſtitution of which does not lie at the <hi>mercy</hi> of the executive power, ſupported by two-thirds of the ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, provided the republican form is retained. The federal conſtitution, it is true, has guaranteed a republican conſtitution to every ſtate in the union; but this proviſion is extremely vague and indefinite. Republican forms of government may be more tyrannic than monarchical. The governments of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Venice, were not ſo free as the ancient government of France, or the preſent government of England.</p>
                  <p>If the preſident, with the advice and conſent of two-thirds of the federal ſenators, has an <hi>abſolute</hi> power to make treaties, they may ſweep away all the laws and conſtitutions of the ſeveral ſtates, without any check from the one I have already mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Every body knows, that the federal conſtitution, at the time of its being propoſed, was not fully approved by a large majority of the people; although it was then adopted, from the preſumed neceſſity of ſome form of government being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted at that period. The power, with reſpect to treaties, was not then underſtood; it was acknowledged by its friends, to have been a mere appeal to the common ſenſe of the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, on a fair experiment of its merits. It admits of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement and alteration, by an article inſerted in it. If the conſtruction of that article by the preſident, reſpecting his power to make treaties, be juſt, it is high time the inhabitants ſhould demand a reviſion of the federal compact—that new checks ſhould be provided, to reſtrain this exorbitant power.</p>
                  <p>But if the preſident, with two-thirds of the ſenators, are now veſted with an abſolute, uncontrouled right to make trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, obligatory to the utmoſt extent, what then are the powers to reſtrain them? It is provided, in the firſt article of the fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſtitution, that the congreſs <hi>"ſhall"</hi> regulate foreign trade. The Engliſh trade is a material part of our foreign commerce. The treaty, which the preſident has ratified, virtually declares, that the congreſs ſhall <hi>not</hi> in future regulate our trade with Great Britain. The conſtitution provides alſo, that the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>ſhall</hi> regulate our trade with the Indian nations; may not the preſident and ſenate make ſuch a treaty as ſhall alſo wreſt
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:028389_0402_0FD8EB29155695E0"/>that important privilege from the houſe of repreſentatives, and thus monopolize all the patronage and benefits annexed to it?</p>
                  <p>Either the treaty is conſtitutional, or <hi>not;</hi> if the latter, it is a nullity; if the former, the powers of the whole congreſs can be controuled, and even annihilated, by a part.</p>
                  <p>Under the old confederation, we were diſtinguiſhed by our imbecility at home, but we appeared with dignity abroad. In our diplomatic arrangements with foreign nations, we certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were infinitely ſuperior to what we had a right to expect. We were then in our childhood, and yet the vigour of our policy had the ſtamp of adoleſcence. Every treaty we <hi>then</hi> form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and we formed four with four of the moſt conſiderable nations in Europe—with France, with Holland, with Pruſſia, and with Sweden—recognized the rights of a free trade, as an eſſential claim, reſulting from our independence, as a nation, and of our remote ſituation from the vortex of the European politics, in which we were determined never to be involved. But how contrary is this conduct to our preſent! While the right of a free navigation is maintained in thoſe national en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, to the utmoſt latitude, our late treaty with England has ſet them all aſide, and placed our navigation on ſo preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious an eſtabliſhment, that nothing but the diſtreſſes or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity of the French republic can ſave us from total ruin. In this late ſpecimen of out talents in negociation, we have counter-worked, at a ſtroke, all we have been doing from the firſt moment of the revelation. What will hinder the French from taking the ſame freedom with our trade which the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh are now taking every moment?</p>
                  <p>Before this treaty, we had neceſſity to plead; but we have now conſented to permit the exerciſe of a power over our navigation, which has never yet been acknowledged by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Britiſh now have a right, by compact, ſigned and ſealed, to every thing they wiſhed to do, and infinitely more than they ever expected to obtain. They are permitted to take our proviſions bound to France; will not, then, the French take our proviſions bound to England, Spain, and Portugal? The Britiſh are permitted to take and condemn all our naval ſtores, found in our veſſels; will not the French and Dutch claim the ſame privilege? The Britiſh are permitted to take and condemn French goods in American bottoms; will not the French and Dutch cruiſers take and condemn all Engliſh goods, in the ſame manner? It is well known, that nearly all outward bound commodities, of the growth or manufacture of Great Britain, are ſhipped on credit to theſe ſtates, and are
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:028389_0403_0FD8EB308CC345E0"/>inſured in England previous to their exportation. All theſe veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels are thus rendered liable to capture, and the goods to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. For every treaty with the powers enumerated, ſtipulates, with great preciſion, that no future privilege ſhall be extended to another nation, which ſhall not equally extend to them. If this be the caſe, and I have no doubt of it, and the republic is not reſtrained by more than common generoſity, ſhe will do as the Britiſh do; their conduct will be her rule; and our blind confidence in our preſent corrupt policy, will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded by an extent and variety of ſufferings beyond example.</p>

                  <p>IN the treaty announced in the public papers, between his Britannic majeſty and the United States; it appears by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle the 5th, that the river St. Croix, our eaſtern boundary, is to be aſcertained by commiſſioners appointed in the manner fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: "One commiſſioner ſhall be named by his majeſty, and one by the preſident of the United States, by and with the conſent of the ſenate thereof; and the ſaid commiſſioners ſhall agree on the choice of a third, or, if they cannot ſo agree, they ſhall each propoſe one perſon, and of the two names ſo propoſed, one ſhall be drawn by lot, in the preſence of the two commiſſioners."

                  <p>The mode of ſettlement ſeems more like a reference, or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitration; with this difference, that, like a lottery, it will p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderate on the ſide, which draws the lucky prize, and, of courſe, will give force and ſanction to the claim.</p>
                  <p>It is a fact, incontrovertible, that the Eaſtern River of Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maquady, called by the Indians, Mag-ga-gau-da-wick, was known by public notoriety, for the two laſt centuries, as the true St. Croix. There are records of a ſettlement made between the courts of Verſailles and St. James, about the years <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> and 1622, eſtablithing this river; and the ſeveral treaties between
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:028389_0404_0FD8EB351B37F8C8"/>the two nations, until Nova Scotia was laſt ceded to Britain, confirmed it. Since which, ſome local diſputes aroſe between Maſſachuſetts and Nova Scotia, but were always terminated the ſame way. Even during the adminiſtration of Governor Bernard, who was well known never to favor the intereſt of this country, it was then proved by indiſputable evidence to be the veritable St. Croix; and though it is not eſſential, in this caſe, ſtill it may be obſerved, that when the Royaliſts moved from Penobſcot to St. Andrews, the entrance of Shuduck river) in 1783, it was publicly noticed among themſelves, as preſumptuous, being uncertain of a right in ſo doing. What has been done, ſince the revolution, on this ſubject, is too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and ſo well known, it needs no comment.</p>
                  <p>Thus the boundaries were, and ought to be eſtabliſhed. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that valuable extent of territory, which lies between the ſaid St. Croix, and the river Shuduck (which the Britiſh now call the boundary) is the indubitable right of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts.</p>
                  <p>As this article in the treaty now ſtands, the claim is made equal; ſo that ſhould the commiſſioner on the ſide of the United States draw the perſon he propoſes, we may have a chance to ſecure what was before our own—if, on the other hand, the Britiſh commiſſioner draws the perſon, Britain obtains a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, ſhe has no title to, ſeparate from her connections with Maſſachuſetts. From theſe circumſtances, it may be eaſy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that thoſe commiſſioners, or arbitrators, ſhould have been independent, diſintereſted perſons, unconnected with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> have ſucceeded too well; twenty ſenators have agreed to all but one article. I ſhall make no reflection on theſe gentlemen, who for this purpoſe were a bare majority. But the manner in which the buſineſs was conducted, leaves too much room to fear, that the moſt important intereſts of our country have been ſacrificed to gratify party zeal. It is, certainly, ſomewhat extraordinary, that long before the treaty was known, the vote of each of theſe gentlemen was reckoned upon with the utmoſt certainty.—It is not my intention to acquit thoſe who oppoſe the treaty from their ſhare of this baneful ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>The cenſure of many is accompanied with too much acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. There is, however, another claſs, who will probably decide upon its merits: I mean the moderate men, and real patriots, who, ſcorning to be be led by others, will take th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <pb n="119" facs="unknown:028389_0406_0FD8EB380F5D4210"/>trouble of judging for themſelves. To perſons of this deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, theſe remarks will be addreſſed. Previous to diſcuſſing the treaty itſelf, we muſt not paſs unnoticed the myſterious ſecrecy which has inveloped a tranſaction of the laſt moment to the happineſs and proſperity of America.—Is not this ſecrecy, alone, a proof that the ſenate conceived it diſgraceful and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the United States? The public clamour which they ſaw would be excited, might have deferred them from the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſtep of giving it their aſſent; whereas, they well knew, that if it was not divulged until ratified, many, who might have been violent in their oppoſition, would, as good citizens, ſubmit to it as ſoon as it became the ſupreme law of the land. There might be a propriety in the ſecrecy obſerved by the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; but the ſenate ought to have afforded the public the ſame opportunity of judging of it, which they have of canvaſſing every bill in its paſſage towards a law. Inſtead of this, they take care that no part of it ſhall tranſpire, except the time limited for the ſurrendering the weſtern poſts, and that ſome kind of proviſion was made for indemnifying our merchants. Neither Governor Jay, nor the ſenate, were at any pains to conceal theſe points of the treaty, while they carefully with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the ſacrifices which were to be the price of thoſe benefits. The ſenate, indeed, go further, and, as if afraid or aſhamed of what they had done, enjoin their members, even after their act of ratification, not to make any part of it public; and Mr. Maſon, who deſerves the thanks of his country, is cenſured for diſregarding an injunction, which was nugatory in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and reflected no great honor on the legiſlature of a free people.</p>
                     <p>Another preliminary remark may be made here, as it will aſſiſt in forming a juſt eſtimate of this convention. It is this, the firſt impreſſions made by the peruſal of it, were univerſally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favorable; all men, and all ranks, united in condemning it— A gloom, co-extenſive with its circulation, took place.—Thoſe who were ſilent as to its defects, could not forbear to expreſs a wiſh, that it had never been made, and readily agreed, that we ſhould be much better without it. Had a petition immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately been prepared to be preſented to the preſident, againſt its ratification, nine merchants in ten would have ſigned it: and not a mechanic would have refuſed. When the people with one voice condemn a meaſure, of which they are competent judges, it furniſhes a violent preſumption againſt the expediency of it.</p>
                     <p>This general clamour, and diſcontent alarmed the envoy, and thoſe, who had predetermined to ſupport him. Recourſe was had to their uſual induſtry and arts. Some took their ſtand at the
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:028389_0407_0FD8EB3994B24B48"/>coffee houſes, others ran about the ſtreets; but notwithſtanding their diligence, the moſt vigorous exertions and prudent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct on the part of its opponents, were neceſſary to prevent Mr. Jay's effigy and the fruits of his negociation from being conſigned to the flames in one part of the city,<note n="*" place="bottom">New York.</note> while the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh merchants were feaſting him in another.</p>
                     <p>We come now to the treaty. The preamble itſelf, is not free from objection. The differences between the two countries are to be terminated "without reference to the merits of their complaints." This is ſurely an unprecedented mode of ſetting public or private controverſies (eſpecially in the time of peace) the merits of which ſhould never be loſt ſight of, and ought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>The ſecond article would have been better and leſs liable to future difficulty and conſtruction, if it had defined particularly from what places his majeſty was to withdraw his troops, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſaying generally from within the boundary "lines aſſigned by the treaty of peace:" for it appears, that thoſe very lines are a matter in diſpute, and hereafter to be ſettled.
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:028389_0408_0FD8EB3FF34F96F0"/>As this boundary will, certainly, not be adjuſted by next June, it will furniſh a pretext for holding thoſe ſorts a few years long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and put us to the expenſe of a ſecond embaſſy. Why not declare, that Michillimackinac, Detroit, Niagara, Oſwego, Oſwegatche, Point-au-ſer, Dutchman's point, &amp;c. ſhould be delivered up? This would have been explicit; but, as we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, we ſhall find, that preciſion and perſpicuity are not very ſtriking features in this miniſterial lucubration. The time limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their evacuations is another objection to the article; it is too remote to hope for its performance. If peace takes place this ſummer, none will be ſurpriſed if Great Britain continues her garriſons where they now are! Nor is it very pleaſing, that the inhabitants within this territory may remain in it, and continue Britiſh ſubjects.</p>
                        <p>That clauſe of this article, which permits us to extend our ſettlements within the ſaid boundary, is alſo by far too indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite The exception to it may be ſo explained, as to defeat the permiſſion altogether.

                        <p>The advantages conceded to Great Britain, by the third ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, are much greater than thoſe which we derive in return. Conſidering the extent of the United States, it is evident, that the mutual liberty here granted, to paſs by land or inland na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation into each other's reſpective territories, upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, is a much greater acquiſition to Great Britain than to us; not only the territory of the former is ſmall, when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with our own, but the whole fur trade, which we might have ſecured to ourſelves, will now not only be participated by, but probably fall altogether into the hands of, Britiſh tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, notwithſtanding our country is much more extenſive, and our rivers and lakes more numerous, than thoſe of Great Britain, into all of which ſhe has free admiſſion; the latter has taken care, very unjuſtly, to exclude our veſſels from the "ſea-ports, harbours, bays, and creeks of his majeſty's ſaid territories," and alſo from "ſuch parts of the rivers as are between the mouths thereof and the higheſt port of entry from the ſea, except in ſmall veſſels trading between Montreal and Quebec." Where is the conſideration for this manifeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality?
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:028389_0409_0FD8EB434B4C0B48"/>A Britiſh trader may ſet out from Canada, traverſe our lakes, and paſs with his merchandize down the Hudſon or Delaware to New York or Philadelphia, with his own veſſel. Why ought we not, in return, to have the free navigation of the Saint Lawrence and other Britiſh rivers? Inſtead of this, we are ſtopped, in our paſſage down, at the higheſt port of entry, and muſt there hire Britiſh veſſels to purſue our voyage, or ſell our cargoes for the beſt price we can get.</p>
                        <p>There is a curious proviſo, in this article, which deſerves notice. Upon a curſory reading, it appears to lay Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain under a ſimilar reſtraint, but the leaſt attention will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover this not to be the caſe. It is this, "<hi>Britiſh veſſels from the ſea</hi> are not to be admitted into our rivers beyond the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt port of entry for veſſels from the ſea." What can Great Britain wiſh for more? <hi>would her ſea veſſels</hi> ever attempt, if permitted, to go further than the higheſt port of entry.</p>
                        <p>That part of this article, which interdicts the laying of duties on peltries brought by land or inland navigation, is alſo highly unequal and diſadvantageous to America. The pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which we ſhall carry through the Britiſh dominions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the conſtruction of this article, muſt be inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble indeed—while we may expect, that very great quantities will annually be brought through the United States, by his majeſty's ſubjects, all of which muſt paſs free of duty. Nay, under this article, Great Britain may import into any part of the United States, European, Eaſt and Weſt India goods, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which we can impoſe no other or higher duties, than are payable by our own citizens.</p>
                        <p>The fourth article concludes nothing; and the fifth leaves too much to chance.</p>

                        <p>The mode of adjuſting the ſum due to Britiſh creditors, agreeably to the ſixth article, will be unjuſt towards thoſe ſtates which have interpoſed no lawful impediments in the way of recovering ſuch debts, as they muſt alſo bear part of the burden, and thus ſuffer for the delinquency of others. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever reads Mr. Jefferſon's letter to Mr. Hammond, of the 29th May, 1792, will acquit the United States of much, if not of the whole of the cenſure which has been ſo liberally beſtowed by Great Britain, for the non-payment of Britiſh debts, which has been urged in excuſe by her, for the infractions of a treaty, which were committed long before ſhe could have known what America had done, or would do, upon this head. Mr. Jefferſon has taken infinite pains to inveſtigate this
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:028389_0410_0FD8EB4513C26150"/>matter, which he has done not only like a ſtateſman, but a conſummate lawyer. It reſults, from his reſearches, that, Great Britain having broken the treaty, by a refuſal to evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the upper poſts, and carrying away more than three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand negroes, ſome of the ſtates, urged by dire neceſſity, and the calamities of a long war, only modified the recovery of debts—

                              <item>1. By indulging their creditors with longer and more practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable terms of payment.</item>
                              <item>2. By liberating their bodies from execution, on delivering property to the creditor, to the full amount of his demand, on a fair appraiſement.</item>
                              <item>3. By admitting, in ſome inſtances, the payment of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in paper money.</item>
                              <item>4. That, notwithſtanding theſe regulations, which were moderate and of ſhort duration, it was at all times perfectly underſtood, that treaties controuled the laws of the ſtate. That the federal and ſtate judiciaries have ſo decided; that, upon this principle, the courts are every where open to Britiſh credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, who have been, for ſome time, in the habit of recovering their debts at law.</item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe ſtatements, and the deductions of Mr. Jefferſon, are ſupported by the opinion of ſome of the firſt lawyers in the different ſtates, which are ſubjoined to his letter. If, then, no lawful impediment exiſts in the way of theſe debts, why not leave the creditors to the ordinary courſe of law, and why fix a ſtigma on the United States, by providing for an infraction of the treaty of peace on their part, which, at preſent does not exiſt. Great Britain was unwilling to omit ſo favorable an opportunity of extorting from our miniſter a conceſſion, of which ſhe will, one day or another, make proper uſe. It is alſo to be regretted, that the article of intereſt has been paſſed, <hi>ſub ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentio,</hi> in this part of the treaty.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Jefferſon has ſhown, in the letter alluded to, that inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, being no part of the debt, may be diſallowed in many caſes, and has cited a great variety of inſtances, from Engliſh law-books, in which it is not given; ſome of which apply with too much force to the ſituation of the parties in queſtion, not to be mentioned. He obſerves, that a great national cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity has been adjudged a ſufficient cauſe to ſuſpend the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of intereſt; that, in the preſent caſe, the law of the creditor party had cut off the perſonal acceſs of his debtor; that the tranſportation of his produce or money to the country of his creditor was interdicted; that, where the creditor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        <p>The declarations of congreſs and our plenipotentiaries, previous to the definitive treaty, and the ſilence of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, afford proof, that intereſt was not intended on our part, nor inſiſted upon by the other; and that, upon the whole, it was the proper province of the judiciary to determine in what caſes intereſt ought or ought not to be allowed.</p>
                        <p>If theſe poſitions of Mr. Jefferſon be defenſible, we cannot but wiſh that this article had been more explicit, as too much is now left to the diſcretion of commiſſioners, ſome, and perhaps a majority of whom, will be Britiſh ſubjects, and even Britiſh creditors.</p>

                        <p>THE ſeventh article is wholly exceptionable. It places at too great a diſtance, the compenſation to which our citizens are entitled, for the moſt unheard-of and atrocious acts of piracy; they are thus not only kept out of a large part of their capitals, for a long time, but any ſpecies of reſtitution becomes extremely precarious and problematical. The captures being, in many caſes, admitted to be unjuſt, the Britiſh go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſhould, at leaſt, have advanced a ſum on account, to be diſtributed immediately among thoſe who had ſuffered. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was a claim better founded; never was time more favorable to enforce it: if Great Britain can procraſtinate, until a peace, the ſettlement of her depredations, her views will be anſwered. By refuſing or delaying, upon one frivolous pretence or other, to nominate commiſſioners, the whole article may be rendered abortive.—Complaint will then come too late.—If we permit, I had almoſt ſaid, if we give her a right, to inſult and plunder us, when we are at peace, and ſhe involved in war with the moſt powerful nation on earth, it will be but prudent to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce, when ſhe is reſtored to the ſtate in which we now find ourſelves.</p>

It is ſaid, that, long ſince, Mr. Hammond ſtated the demand at eighteen hundred thouſand pounds ſterling. It is no excuſe in thoſe who defend the treaty, to ſay, that the preſident had already pledged the government to this meaſure; he had no right ſo to do; and we are now enquiring, not what the preſident has done, but what is proper and incumbent on the United States.—It will be difficult to ſhow that a neutral nation is obliged to go the lengths which the preſent treaty impoſes upon us.</p>

                        <p>This article infringes the rights of the different States, and impairs the obligation of private contracts; nor is it reciprocal, except in appearance and on paper. It has long been the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Engliſh law to exclude aliens from holding real eſtates of inheritance. We have purſued this policy, and the reaſons, aſſigned by Blackſtone, apply much more forcibly to America, than to his own country.—"If," ſays he, "an ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en could acquire a permanent property in lands, he muſt owe an allegiance, equally permanent with that property, to the king of England, which would probably be inconſiſtent with that which he owes to his own natural liege lord: beſides, that <hi>thereby the nation might, in time, be ſubject to foreign influence, and feel many other inconveniencies.</hi>" Conſidering the population of Great Britain, and the energy of her government, ſupported by a ſtanding army, there can be no great danger, at preſent, from a relaxation, on her part, in this principle; but with a country, whoſe population is as thin as ours, and whoſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is yet in its infancy, too great care cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed to prevent the influence which the too eaſy acquiſition of real property cannot fail to give to foreigners. I am aware, that this article does not extend to future purchaſes; but, even limited as it is, it is unjuſt and unequal. Unequal, becauſe no American has been hardy enough to purchaſe real eſtates in Great Britain, while millions of acres are held by her ſubjects in this country, who knew, at the time of the purchaſes, the riſk which they ran in making them. Unjuſt—becauſe, if the preſent proprietor be an alien, the land is already forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſtate which originally granted it, "by way of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing him," ſays Blackſtone, "for his preſumption, in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to acquire any landed property;" or, which will be yet a harder caſe, it may have already been granted to ſome of her citizens. In either caſe, it is not eaſy to conceive upon what principle ſuch a ſtipulation could find place in a

Thus it appears, that all the advantage of this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, with France, is on the ſide of America; for, without any ſtipulations for the purpoſe, a French citizen might, at common law, hold a chattel real, and diſpoſe of any property in goods, money, and other perſonal eſtate, as he pleaſed, and, if he had died inteſtate, this perſonal property would have deſcended to his repreſentatives; whereas, without it, the king of France, upon the death of an American, would have been entitled to all he was worth, by the <hi>droit d'aubaine, or jus alibinatus.</hi>

                        <p>In our treaties with the United Netherlands, Sweden, and Pruſſia, this right to hold and diſpoſe of property, is, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs terms, confined to perſonal eſtate, which, it is obvious, their citizens would have enjoyed, without any treaty for the purpoſe: Of courſe, in all of them, the proviſions are favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to America. This article would not have deſerved ſo much notice, but with the view of detecting the fallacy of thoſe, who attempt to juſtify ſome of the exceptionable parts of this treaty, by a reference to what they call ſimilar ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in thoſe which already bind us to other nations. More fallacies of this kind will be detected in the ſequel. It will alſo ſerve to ſhow, what reliance is to be placed upon the aſſertions of the author of certain "Candid Remarks on the Treaty," which appeared in the Daily Advertiſer of the 4th inſtant.—This writer aſſerts, that, by the 9th and 11th articles of our treaty with France, we have agreed to "<hi>an abſolute abolition of alieniſm,</hi> in reſpect to the holding of lands; ſo that a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may purchaſe, take, hold, and convey lands within the United States, as an American citizen."—The truth is, that the ninth article regulates certain <hi>fiſhing rights,</hi> and ſays not a word on the ſubject under conſideration, and we have already ſeen, that no ſuch right is granted by the 11th article, whoſe object is confined to <hi>goods</hi> alone.</p>

Let us now examine the right of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> a liberal tranſlation of his own words. "Since it is a condition of war, that enemies may be deprived of all their rights, it is reaſonable that every thing of an enemy found among his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſhould <hi>change its owner and go to the treaſury.</hi> It is, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, uſually directed, in all declarations of war, that the goods of enemies, as well thoſe found among us, as thoſe taken in war, ſhall be confiſcated. If we follow the mere right of war, even <hi>immoveable</hi> property may be ſold, and its price carried into the treaſury, as is the cuſtom with moveable property.

Queſt. Jur. pub. lib. ch. 7. And again, in the ſame chapter, "what I have ſaid of things <hi>in action</hi> be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Accordingly, it is for the moſt part agreed among nations, that things in action being confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in war, the peace being made, thoſe which were paid are deemed to have periſhed, and remain extinct, but thoſe not paid revive, and are reſtored to their true creditors." The doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Vattel accords with that already cited. "He who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares war," ſays he, "does not confiſcate the immoveable goods poſſeſſed in his country by his enemy's ſubjects. In per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them to purchaſe and poſſeſs them, he has, in this reſpect, admitted them into the number of his ſubjects; but the income may be ſequeſtrated for hindering the remittance of it to the enemy's country." And again, "when Alexander by conqueſt became abſolute maſter of Thebes, he remitted to the Theſſalians, an hundred talents, which they owed to the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans. The ſovereign has naturally the ſame right over what his ſubjects may be indebted to his enemies. <hi>Therefore he may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcate debts of this nature,</hi> if the term of payment happens in the time of war; or at leaſt he may prohibit his ſubjects from paying while the war laſts." Book III. chap. V.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Jefferſon, alſo, who is not apt to advocate a doctrine merely becauſe it ſuits his preſent purpoſe, when ſpeaking of the rightful acts of war, ſays, "It cannot be denied, that the ſtate of war ſtrictly permits a nation to ſeize the property of its enemies found within its own limits, or taken in war, and in whatever form it exiſts, whether in <hi>action or poſſeſſion.</hi>" I ſhall not conceal, that, although this practice is ſtrictly permitted by the laws of nations; yet thoſe ſovereigns of Europe, who act with good faith, have generally departed from this right, ſo far, that public funds are generally exempted from confiſcation, and ſeizure. Great Britain, however, regardleſs of the conduct of other nations, has, if we are rightly informed, confiſcated or ſequeſtrated, during the preſent war, debts of both theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions; although Vattel ſays, that a ſtate ought never to touch the ſums which it owes to the enemy. From what has been ſaid, it reſults, that the United States, in caſe of a war with Great Britain, have an undoubted right to confiſcate any debts due by their citizens to the ſubjects of Great Britain, and that if they chooſe to adopt the conduct of that nation, they might confiſcate or ſequeſter the property which they hold in our funds.</p>
                        <p>Indeed this right, in its fulleſt latitude, may fairly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for, from the care which Lord Grenville has taken to
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:028389_0417_0FD8EB59CE10DC50"/>reſtrain the exerciſe of it. It is worthy of remark, by the 21ſt article of the treaty lately made between the French and Dutch republics, it is agreed, "That the French republic ſhall uſe their good offices with foreign powers in favor of the United Provinces, in order to obtain payment of the ſums due them before the war."—And in an Engliſh miniſterial paper, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed ſince this treaty, it is ſaid, "that the declaration of war, on the part of the Dutch, is conſidered, at the preſent moment, as by no means unfavorable for the intereſts of England; as it furniſhes her with the beſt reaſons <hi>for confiſcating an immenſe property in that country belonging to Holland.</hi>"</p>
                        <p>If then it be ſtrictly permitted to ſequeſter and confiſcate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of this ſpecies, why ſurrender the right without an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent? Why give up this powerful means of ſelf-defence, and that to a nation, who, from the firſt moment of her being obliged to acknowledge our independence, has treated us with the moſt perſevering contempt? "It is with concern" ſays Mr. Jefferſon in his letter to Mr. Pinckney, "I am obliged to obſerve, that ſo marked has been the inattention of the Britiſh court to every application which has been made to them on any ſubject by this government (not a ſingle anſwer, I believe hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ever been given to one of them, except in the act of exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a miniſter) that it may become unavoidable in certain caſes, where an anſwer of ſome ſort is neceſſary, to conſider their ſilence as an anſwer." Why then, I repeat, ſhould we ſurrender to ſuch a nation the moſt powerful weapon of defence which is placed in our hands? Is it unjuſt or impolitic to confiſcate the property of a nation, which, without any pretence, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders us of ours on the high ſeas? Is it not more unjuſt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politic to lay our citizens at their mercy? For ſuch muſt now be their unfortunate ſituation, as we have parted with the only means of making them retribution. It is well known, what a powerful effect was produced in England by the bare propoſal to ſequeſter the Britiſh debts. The clamour excited againſt the miniſtry, by the perſons who would have been immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by it, produced a revocation of ſome of the obnoxious edicts of which we complained. And yet, as if our fleets were able to cope with thoſe of Great-Britain, and protect our trade, we have voluntarily, and without conſideration, ſacrificed this powerful engine of defence and terror, although it was almoſt the only effectual one within our power. If in any caſe, it be impolitic or unjuſt, we can forbear on ſuch occaſions to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the right; and we might then deſerve ſome credit for our forbearance; but when bound by treaty to forego, much of the
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:028389_0418_0FD8EB5B544404D0"/>credit, which would otherwiſe be due to our moderation, will be loſt.</p>
                        <p>One obſervation more, and I have done with this article. The ſecure footing upon which bank ſtock is placed by it, will render, it an object with the king of Great Britain, as a ſource of influence, as well as of intereſt. He had already ſpeculated in our funds. It will not, therefore, be ſurpriſing, if, after this, he or his miniſter ſhould inveſt a very large ſum in this way; nay, what is to prevent him, conſidering the length of his purſe, from engroſſing all the ſhares of theſe different inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions which have multiplied ſo wonderfully ſince the peace, or at leaſt a ſufficient number to ſecure the uncontrouled direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them? I leave it to others to picture the diſtreſſed and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſituation of our country, ſhould her whole capital be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtered by his Britannic majeſty, or by thoſe of his appointment. How will our public operations be cramped in time of war, or upon any ſudden emergency, ſhould his majeſty deem it inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to accommodate the government with a loan, at the ſame time, by withholding from our citizens put it out of their power to ſupply her wants? Even, in time of peace, it muſt be humiliating to an American to be obliged to Britiſh directors for a loan. They will, ſometimes, no doubt, be moſt graciouſly accommodated with a ſmall ſum, provided there be more than ſufficient to anſwer the extravagant demands of his majeſty's moſt loving ſubjects. Theſe evils may appear to ſome, diſtant and chimerical. Some, however, are already felt; for of what countrymen are the directors generally compoſed? and others will follow a ratification of the treaty, as naturally as an effect does its cauſe. I am aware, that in the bank of the United States, and in ſome others, a non-reſident ſtockholder cannot give his vote by proxy for a director. This difficulty will eaſily be obviated, not indeed by his majeſty's perſonal attendance, although ſuch a viſit might not be impolitic, but by holding this ſpecies of ſtock in the name of his ambaſſador, who will always be on the ſpot. If it ſhould be neceſſary to divide it a little, in order to extend his influence, he will not be at a loſs for friends. Some of our ſenators may think it an honor, and perhaps a duty, to hold part of the royal ſtock in their own name, and to repreſent and obey the real owner in all matters which relate to their reſpective inſtitutions.</p>
                        <p>Theſe ten articles are to be permanent. We might, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, reaſonably hope, that in ſome of them, at leaſt, could be found an advantage to the United States. But we ſearch for it in vain. The more we examine the inſtrument, the greater is our ſurpriſe and concern, that our intereſts have been ſo little
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:028389_0419_0FD8EB5F331B05E8"/>attended to, and that Great Britain has given us no one thing in return for conceſſions which are important to her, and will ſooner or later be ſeverely felt and reprobated by America.</p>
                        <p>One palpable omiſſion is diſcoverable in the perpetual part of this contract. It has occurred to every one, and reſpects the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation which was due to our citizens for the negroes which were carried away, at the peace; as by the ſeventh article of the treaty of peace, his Britannic majeſty ſtipulates, that be would with all convenient ſpeed and without cauſing any deſtruction or carrying away any negroes or other property of the American inhabitants, withdraw all his armies from the United States. Notice was received by Sir Guy Carleton of this treaty in the beginning of April, 1783, after which no negroes ſhould have been carried away—Yet, as early as the ſixth of May, a <hi>large</hi> number had been already embarked for Nova Scotia, of which General Waſhington complained, as a violation of the treaty— In Sir Guy Carleton's anſwer, dated 12th May, 1783, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits the fact, but ſuppoſes he had no right to deprive them of their liberty. He mentions, however, that he had preſerved an accurate regiſter, by which the name of the proprietor, and the value of the negro, might be aſcertained, in order that an adjuſtment might take place by compenſation, if it really was the intention of the treaty, that they ſhould be reſtored. Under this pretext, Sir Guy embarked, between the months of April and that of November, when the evacuation took place, three thouſand negroes, who were inſpected by our commiſſioners, and a very large number more, in public and private veſſels, of whom they were not permitted to take inſpection.—"Here then," ſays Mr. Jefferſon, "was a <hi>direct, unequivocal,</hi> and <hi>avowed</hi> violation of this part of the ſeventh article, in the firſt moments of its being known—An article which had been of <hi>extreme ſolicitude</hi> on our part, and on the fulfilment of which depended the means of paying debts, in proportion to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of labourers withdrawn; and when, in the very act of violation, we warn and put the commanding officer on his guard, he ſays directly, he will go through with the act, and leave it to his court to <hi>adjuſt it by compenſation.</hi>" Yet this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, after being delayed twelve years, is formally aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, in a manner as <hi>direct, unequivocal,</hi> and <hi>avowed,</hi> as that in which the infraction was committed, and that, too, in a moment when all America believed Mr. Jay was ſent to demand juſtice for this, among other grievances—Our only conſolation for this palpable ſacrifice, is the reflection, that if compenſation for the negroes had been granted, ſome very extravagant conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration would have been exacted by Great Britain, and, in all
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:028389_0420_0FD8EB608FAD6D80"/>probability, obtained, conſidering the complaiſant mood in which the negociation appears to have been conducted on our part. Perhaps, then, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> is owing to this omiſſion, that the treaty wants one other exceptionable article. I ſhall only add here, that the negroes carried away, regiſtered and unregiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, could not have amounted to leſs than <hi>five thouſand,</hi> who, at two hundred and fifty dollars a man, were worth <hi>one million, two hundred and fifty thouſand dollars;</hi> a ſum more than ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to pay all the old Britiſh debts, due from American citizens.</p>
                        <p>The eleventh article ſtipulates, that there ſhall be, between the two countries, a reciprocal and perfect liberty of naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and commerce, under certain limitations and conditions, expreſſed in the articles which follow.</p>
                        <p>We are happy, at length, to arrive at an article, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes ſomething like reciprocity and perfect equality. We hope our envoy will not again loſe ſight of theſe corner ſtones of a treaty, and that Great Britain, tired or aſhamed of obtaining every thing ſhe has yet aſked, will manifeſt a diſpoſition ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more liberal than has yet appeared. The reader will judge whether this has been the caſe. His expectations, however, muſt not be too ſanguine, or his diſappointment may be ſtill greater than mine was.</p>

                        <p>AS even a majority of the ſenate, who do not appear to have been very difficult to pleaſe, have diſapproved of this article, few partizans of the treaty can be found hardy enough to advocate it. The doctrine of paſſive obedience and non-reſiſtance, which is again becoming ſo faſhionable, ought to teach them the propriety of being ſilent; for how can the ſenate do wrong? But, notwithſtanding the negative of the ſenate, and exceptionable as it is in every part, ſome few there are, who have repreſented it as a vaſt acquiſition to this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and expreſs great regret at the <hi>ſtipulated ſuſpenſion.</hi> Some indeed ſay, that the advocates of this deſcription neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their birth, education, or attachments, in this country.

But as this article was not ratified, owing to the firmneſs of one of the majority, a ſenator from Maſſachuſetts, it cannot be neceſſary to pay it a very minute attention.

                        <p>"Our veſſels are to pay in the ſaid ports no higher tonnage duty than is paid for Britiſh veſſels in our ports, nor are we to pay higher duties or charges, on the importation or expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of merchandiſe, than is paid on the ſame articles, when imported or exported in Britiſh veſſels; but it is expreſsly agreed, that the veſſels of the United States ſhall not carry any of the <hi>articles exported by them from the ſaid Britiſh territories,</hi> to any port or place, except to ſome port or place in America, <hi>where the ſame ſhall be unladen.</hi> Nor are our veſſels to carry on any part of the coaſting trade of the ſaid Britiſh territor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        <p>This being the article, about which the friends of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty have exulted moſt, it was thought proper to give it pretty well at length. It has been aſſerted, that, by it, important commercial rights are ſecured to our citizens, in their navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and trade with the Britiſh Eaſt Indies. To form a juſt eſtimate of theſe advantages, attention muſt be had to the commerce of the contracting parties, at the time of forming the treaty. If it is placed on a better footing, we have gained,
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:028389_0423_0FD8EB651A819560"/>provided we have not paid too great a price. But if our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce in the Eaſt Indies is reſtrained by this article, it will be ſomewhat difficult to point out any advantage we have acquired by it. The merchants, who are certainly the moſt competent judges in theſe matters, contend, that the trade of the United States to the Eaſt Indies, is placed on a much worſe footing than before. They aſſign, among others, the following reaſons: 1ſt, That American veſſels carry a ſmall proportion of ſalted proviſions to Bombay, where they take in cotton and ſharks fins on freight to China, which was ſo conſiderable, as to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them to lay in a return cargo to great advantage. A ſhip of five hundred tons would clear thirty thouſand dollars.</p>
                        <p n="2">2d, The American ſhips going to Bengal, frequently found very advantageous freights to ſome free port in Europe. The cuſtomary freight was from ten to fifteen pounds ſterling a ton. It is ſuppoſed that nine-tenths of our trade to the Britiſh Eaſt Indies was carried on in this way.</p>
                        <p n="3">3d, The direct trade of Bengal and Bombay was trifling until the ſugar plantations in the Weſt Indies were deſtroyed. We then imported ſugar from the Eaſt Indies to advantage; but on the reſtoration of peace. this trade cannot be purſued but to a diſadvantage—the voyage being too long, the ſugar not ſo ſtrong as that of the Weſt Indies, and the ſupplies from the iſlands being ſufficient for any uſe we can make of them, the former not anſwering to refine. Saltpetre is an article which we may import to advantage: in peace we want but little of it, and in war it is prohibited.</p>

                     <p>COTTON is low in the Eaſt Indies, but not of a good quality. It will not anſwer for importing, while we can have that of the Weſt Indies and our own, the ſtaple being too ſhort for water ſpinning. White goods, with ſome gold and ſilver muſlins, may be imported from Bombay and Calcutta, and ſome printed muſlins from Madras; but the conſumption of this country would not require three cargoes in a year, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we printed them. The French uſe many; but they import them to print, and vend them in Europe and the Weſt Indies. Almoſt all <hi>white goods</hi> may be had on the Hoogley, juſt above Calcutta, at a place called Beſunpoor, a Daniſh port, on lower terms than at Calcutta, alſo at Chandanagore, a French port,
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:028389_0424_0FD8EB694A361320"/>at the mouth of the Ganges. From the Iſle of France we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port coffee and indigo; they raiſe cotton, which, for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons above mentioned, is ſeldom imported, and becauſe it anſwers better in China. Coffee anſwers well, as the price is lower and the quality better, than that from the Weſt Indies. We export to that place, ſalted proviſions, and ſome naval ſtores; and our veſſels are frequently employed in carrying ſlaves and cattle, from Madagaſcar and the Main, for the uſe of that colony.</p>
                     <p>From this curſory view of our commerce with the Eaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, it appears, that were we excluded altogether from the Britiſh ſettlements, we could obtain the ſame articles upon as eaſy or better terms, at other ports. This muſt be the reaſon, why Great Britain has ſo long permitted the trade in queſtion; or perhaps a better one is, ſome immediate benefit ſhe derives from it; for it will not be contended, that a nation who has done us no one act of kindneſs, during twelve years of peace, has been influenced in this part of her conduct, by affection for us, or any other worthy motive. Notwithſtanding, then, that this trade has heretofore been carried on, by the mere permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Britiſh government, it was no more precarious, or likely to be interrupted or ſtopped, than the trade we carried on with her European ports. As well might it be ſaid, that Great Britain had hitherto <hi>merely permitted</hi> us to export her manufactures, and to run in debt every year to her merchants, and as this right may be reſtrained or prohibited whenever ſhe pleaſes, it is a great acquiſition to have ſecured it, in ſuch way as to be liable to no interruption. If, then, it be true, that we enjoyed the Eaſt India trade in as great a latitude before, as at preſent, with the addition of the coaſting trade of that country, which principally rendered it worth purſuing, why relinquiſh the latter, without acquiring any extenſion of the former? for as to its permanency, it has already been ſhown, that it was as much ſo, as the intereſt of Great Britain could render it. Nay, why not only give up the carrying trade; but ſtipulate expreſsly, that we will carry to no part of the world, except to the United States, the Eaſt India goods we export from the Britiſh ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. I know it has been ſaid, that we are not reſtrained by this article, from exporting from the United States, the goods we bring from thoſe factories in the haſt Indies. It is much to be regretted, that in an inſtrument of this kind, any room ſhould be left for conſtruction or for doubt, as to the true mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="138" facs="unknown:028389_0425_0FD8EB6B0B01AC38"/>too well, that if conſtruction is reſorted to, Great Britain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the more powerful nation, will be able to put her own upon it; and we have too much reaſon to fear, from what has alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy happened, that even thoſe who now contend for a contrary conſtruction, will be complaiſant enough, to accede to the one adopted by the Engliſh miniſtry. For we have men among us, and they are called <hi>patriots,</hi> who have juſtified that nation for her repeated violation of faith to this country, and particularly for her non-obſervance of the treaty of peace, although Mr. Jefferſon, not by reaſoning alone, but by facts, has proved that ſhe was not to be juſtified in a ſingle inſtance.</p>
                     <p>It is from this conduct of ſome of our citizens in office, that Great Britain has been encouraged to perſevere in her faithleſs ſyſtem towards us, and to demand from us ſtipulations which an unfortunate war of ten years ought never to have extorted from us. It was a circumſtance of additional misfortune to the United States, that the late envoy, for reaſons which will never perhaps be developed, was among the foremoſt in juſtifying the conduct of Great Britain. From his efforts, therefore, it was impoſſible for Americans to expect favorable terms. I acquit him, however, and that moſt ſincerely, of any bribery or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, in this negociation, ſo ſtrongly charged upon him by many. I rather believe, that he has been <hi>cajoled</hi> into the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure—and that from a belief that <hi>any treaty whatever,</hi> with Great Britain, would be pleaſing to a certain party among us. Rather, therefore, than diſappoint the expectations of thoſe people, he has affixed his ſeal to an inſtrument, which muſt meet the marked diſapprobation of every man in America, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſuch only as form the Britiſh faction, from whom alone, the United States have to apprehend any kind of danger to their conſtitution and liberties. This diſſatisfaction manifeſted itſelf in a moſt emphatical manner, on the late anniverſary of our independence. Even on that auſpicious day, when it is uſual to bury perſonal animoſity, and to check the effuſions and gall of party ſpirit, how unanimouſly have different ſocieties and companies, without any previous concert, not only in this city, but in other parts of the ſtate and union, expreſſed their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of the meaſure! Toaſts, ſignificant of their diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, have already appeared from every part; and among the variety which that day gave birth to, is one to be found, which diſcovers even a partial approbation of the treaty?

Alarmed at an oppoſition ſo ſormidable, and conſcious, that the meaſure cannot be defended, thoſe who feed a peculiar intereſt in forcing it upon us, begin to reſort to their old cry of anti-federaliſm. A calm obſerver, in the Daily Advertiſer of the 11th, remarks, that "a <hi>few weak-minded</hi> perſons have been imperceptibly led aſtray, and almoſt ſacrificed their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples on the altar of faction and diſappointment, under the garb of republicaniſm; they have wiſely choſen the late treaty for their rallying point, and over the back of this hobby horſe, aimed a <hi>deadly blow</hi> at the conſtitution."—Inſtead of anſwering the numerous objections which are daily made to the treaty, this writer aims an undiſtinguiſhed conſure againſt all who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it. All thoſe who cannot ſee what thoſe champions have not yet diſcovered themſelves, that the treaty is an eligible one for this country, are, forſooth, <hi>weak-minded,</hi> or anti-federaliſts. —It is not eaſy to diſcover any connection between the fate of this treaty and the conſtitution. The true friends of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution may be oppoſed to the treaty, as, on the other hand, its enemies may advocate it: whether this be really the caſe, is left to the people, if they be not too <hi>weak-minded,</hi> to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. Be not deceived, fellow citizens; thoſe who oppoſe the treaty, are as firm friends to the conſtitution as any among you; they know its excellencies, and are not afraid to ſpeak of its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, as time and operation diſcover them; for what human work is perfect? They wiſh not only that it may be maintained, but that it may be defended from the encroachments of a ſet of men, who, while accuſing you of a deſire of overthrowing the government, are deſtroying the firſt principles of our aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, and by conſtructions, uſurpation, and otherwiſe, are either aſſuming to themſelves or granting to others, powers and authorities not warranted by the conſtitution. Is there a man among us who has ever adviſed you to oppoſe any meaſure of government? Do we diſpute the right of the ſenate and preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to make treaties? No; but we inſiſt upon the right (and it was the exerciſe of this right which ſecured our freedom and independence) of giving our ſentiments upon any act which it is propoſed to make the rule of our conduct and the ſupreme law of the land; we claim the privilege of petitioning and remonſtrating againſt a meaſure, which ignominiouſly ſacrifices to our firſt and greateſt enemy, our juſt demands, and muſt, in time, proſtrate at her feet, our very ſovereignty and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. We think we are not to blame for expoſing to view the ſecret machinations of one branch of the legiſlature to form a diſgraceful connection with any nation. In ſine, we claim the right of thinking for ourſelve, uninfluenced by <hi>office</hi> or other
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:028389_0427_0FD8EB72C97C92D8"/>unworthy conſiderations, and we thank God, that the unbiaſſed voice of America, as far as it has been heard, from the ſeveral ſtates where our diſgrace has been publiſhed, is on our ſide. —We rejoice at this circumſtance, becauſe ſuch united and unconcerted marks of diſpleaſure, we yet hope, may induce the preſident to ſuſpend his ſanction, and thereby give himſelf a new title to the endearing appellation of the father of his country.</p>
                     <p>But it is time to return to the 13th article—we left it in doubt, whether Americans could carry to Europe, or elſwhere (except to their own country) the articles they export from the Britiſh Eaſt Indies; for, if they cannot, it is conceded, that ſuch a reſtriction, together with a formal dereliction of the coaſting trade, were conſiderations too valuable and diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned for the permiſſion given us in the former part of the article. I ſay, we cannot, and that, confuſed as the phraſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy is, it will admit of no other reaſonable conſtruction. "It is expreſsly agreed (theſe are the words of the treaty) that the veſſels of the United States ſhall not carry any <hi>of the articles exported by them from the ſaid Britiſh territories</hi> (or, in other words, any <hi>Britiſh Eaſt India articles</hi>) to any port or place, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to ſome port or place in America, <hi>where the ſame ſhall be unladen.</hi>" If, then, the articles have been exported by us, from the Britiſh territories in the Eaſt Indies, under which clauſe is it, that we claim a right to carry them to Europe, or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where? If ſuch privilege was intended, why oblige us to <hi>unlade</hi> them in the United States? or why not, in expreſs terms, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the permiſſion? Hence it follows, that this article, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of extending our commerce, may be regarded among the moſt obnoxious of the treaty; and I am well informed, that our merchants, who are immediately concerned in the Eaſt India trade, view it in that light: Britiſh factories will ſoon be eſtabliſhed in our principal ſea-ports; and, in a few years, the whole of this trade muſt fall into their hands. Well might Mr. Pitt boaſt, on the floor of the houſe of commons, that he was not aſhamed of his treaty with this country; his ſtill in finance has been long admitted; his abilities, as a nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciator, ought never hereafter to be called in queſtion.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>YOU muſt be ſenſible that no meaſure of the Britiſh, ſince you was engaged in politics, has been more generally reprobated by the people of <hi>America,</hi> than the late treaty; which, not only as it reſpects <hi>the eventual ſurrender of this country into the hands of our inveterate enemies, the Britiſh,</hi> but even <hi>the ſecret mode of conducting this buſineſs,</hi> has naturally led the citizens to view it with a peculiar jealouſy.</p>
                  <p>The apparent objects of Mr. Jay's miſſion, are ſo oppoſite to what he has accompliſhed in his treaty, that it was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived poſſible that you would juſtify his conduct. The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of it we have under your own communications. It is therein declared, that you meant to give <hi>"ſolemnity"</hi> to his miſſion. You arreſted the proceedings of congreſs on this explicit decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that you intended to vindicate the rights of the people, and expreſs their <hi>"feelings."</hi> The <hi>confidence</hi> placed in you, reconciled even the advocates for other meaſures, to the <hi>iſſue</hi> of your ſolemn appeal to the Britiſh court. This is ſo evident to have been the voice of your conſtituents, <hi>at the time Mr. Jay was appointed,</hi> that even the tories ſuſpected that ſomething intereſting would take place in vindication of our national ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor; and that you would feel yourſelf <hi>bound</hi> to ſupport your proclamation, agreeably to the <hi>modern</hi> law of nations. But, ſtrange to ſay, your ambaſſador has deſtroyed the very ground upon which your proclamation was founded, and has made a treaty in direct violation of it. <hi>You</hi> mentioned the <hi>modern</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, on the contrary <hi>he</hi> has expreſsly declared the reverſe. <hi>You</hi> was ſo particular on this point, as to <hi>italiciſe</hi> the term <hi>"modern;"</hi> but in oppoſition to this declaration, <hi>he</hi> has conſented to the <hi>ancient</hi> law of nations, which is, no more, nor leſs, than the <hi>particular law of Britain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When your proclamation was firſt iſſued, ſeveral towns met to approbate it; and even many of thoſe perſons who are now addreſſing you in behalf of the treaty (whoſe political principles, by the way, have, in no inſtance, been remarkably friendly to the rights of the people) were in favor of the proclamation.—
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:028389_0429_0FD8EB75D4509B78"/>But, as if ſome ſtrange fatality attended the affairs of <hi>America,</hi> thoſe very perſons are for relinquiſhing the ſpirit of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, which they were ſo anxious to ſupport, and are now urging you, contrary to the ſentiments of ninety-nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredths of their fellow citizens, to ratify a <hi>treaty</hi> which deſtroys the very eſſence of it.</p>
                  <p>Wherein, ſir, has Mr. Jay been ſucceſsful in his negociation, that <hi>you</hi> or <hi>they</hi> can approbate his conduct? You was either <hi>miſtaken</hi> in your <hi>proclamation,</hi> or Mr. Jay muſt be guilty of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to his inſtructions. But the latter does not appear, and yet it is ſaid, that you have ratified his treaty, while nothing is handed to the public to convince them that you was <hi>miſtaken</hi> in vindicating their neutrality upon the "<hi>modern</hi> law" of nations. This, at leaſt, we ought to be gratified with; for notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the confidence placed in you, we are left in a diſagreeable dilemma; for if we juſtify the <hi>treaty,</hi> we muſt condemn your proclamation; or if we are in ſavor of the proclamation, we muſt reprobate the treaty.</p>
                  <p>We requeſt of you then, ſir, to let us know the reaſons, why you cannot vindicate your <hi>primary conduct,</hi> before we are obliged to accede to the propriety of Mr. Jay's negociation. If you was precipitate in your proclamation, by guaranteeing to the United States, their neutrality, on the "<hi>modern law</hi> of nations"—if you was equally haſty in declaring that Mr. Jay was ſent to vindicate, with firmneſs, the rights of the United States—if theſe things were done without <hi>mature deliberation,</hi> and you are now obliged to <hi>retreat,</hi> "We, the people," as friends to <hi>you,</hi> and to <hi>themſelves,</hi> would thank you to let them know the reaſons, why you have altered your ſentiments?</p>
                  <p>In politics, as in religion, we ought to be furniſhed with ſome arguments of the "hope that is within us;" but as the treaty buſineſs ſtands at preſent, your friends are puzzled to vindicate your conduct againſt the common ſenſe of that claſs of citizens, who reaſon from no other ſource than what they conceive to be the welfare of their country.</p>
                  <p>About the ſame time that Mr. Jay was ſent on his embaſſy to England, to vindicate our rights, Mr. Monroe was ſent to France, with an explicit declaration, to draw <hi>cloſer the bonds of alliance between the two republics.</hi> In this inſtance, the people were pleaſed. Mr. Jay went to <hi>demand indemnification</hi> on the principles of our being a neutral nation, agreeable to the "mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern law;" while Mr. Monroe was ſent to form a more intimate alliance with France. A benediction accompanied your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion on this occaſion, that "God would take the republic under his holy keeping." But it ſeems, that while the French
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:028389_0430_0FD8EB770BFEB590"/>were willing to enter into the moſt beneficial commercial alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with America, they were diſregarded, when at the ſame time Mr. Jay was hurrying on his buſineſs, under all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of his moſt gracious majeſty's levees, and the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments of Pitt, and his condjutors.—And ſtill further, when he arrived in America, be is cloſeted under all the injunctions of profound ſecrecy, and the deciſions of the ſenate are urged to be ratified "without delay," with only the ſuſpenſion of one article.</p>
                  <p>What, ſir, are the people to think on this procedure; or what are the French to conjecture? Muſt not the <hi>latter</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that there is an earneſt deſire to link this country in a treaty with England, rather than with them? You cannot, ſir, ſuppoſe that the French are ſo blind, as not to notice this appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent partiality; and provided they ſhould reſent it, or conſider it as an inſidious piece of conduct on our part, it would be a ſerious queſtion among the citizens, to <hi>aſſiſt part of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> in oppoſition to that nation which helped us when we required their aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>Theſe, ſir, are important conſiderations. They require a ſerious deliberation before they are rejected. The Americans feel an attachment to France, and they cannot be eaſily turned aſide from wiſhing them ſucceſs. They have every reaſon to reſpect the French, and they have as cogent reaſons to repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the Engliſh. We eſteem you, ſir, for what you have done, in company with the American army, and the French navy and ſoldiers; but you may excuſe the citizens of America, if they ſtill retain an affection for their allies, and are unwilling, through the inſtrumentality of any man or body of men, to come again under the controul of the Britiſh.</p>
                  <p>We fought to obtain our rights, and we truſt in heaven that we ſhall be able to hand them down to our poſterity. It is of but little conſequence by whom we are ſacrificed, whether by Lord North or Judge Jay.</p>
                  <p>On this queſtion, we mean to reſpect you; but the liberties of America have been purchaſed at too dear a rate to be loſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>a ſtrugyle</hi> for their maintenance.</p>

Though it cannot be unintereſting to me to know, that the wiſhes of a part of my fellow citizens have been contravened by this deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; yet, if the purity of my intentions will entitle me to their approbation, it has not been forfeited on the preſent important occaſion.</p>

                  <p>I BELIEVE there never was a bolder abſurdity publiſhed, than, that in a repreſentative government, the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive body is not bound by the opinion of the body conſtituent: for if it be true, that the repreſentative body be not thus bound, repreſentation is neither truſt nor agency, but another name for the worſt ſpecies of deſpotiſm, where the will of the many is controuled by the opinion of the few. It is true, that many ſpecious ſophiſms have been invented within theſe few years, to quibble away the ſovereignty of the people of the United States: but my conſcience impels me to believe, that the man who cheats his fellow citizens out of their liberties, by falſe logic, is a more deteſtable character, than he, who, with a falſe key, opens the doors of his neighbour's houſe, rifles him of his ſubſtance, inaſmuch, as liberty is more precious than wealth.</p>
                  <p>The only writer I know of, who has written expreſsly on this ſubject, is Noah Webſter, junior, Eſquire, attorney at law. This gentleman ſays, in his fourth chapter on governments, "That the people ought not to give binding inſtructions to repreſentatives. That the right of election is the only conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional right which they can, with propriety, exerciſe." Theſe poſitions, he ſays, convey the ſame idea; and, if true, they contravene, in ſome meaſure, a fundamental maxim of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican politics, which is, that the ſovereign power reſides in the people. Moſt unqueſtionably, if theſe poſitions are true, then is the maxim falſe. But, ſays this gentleman, "I am not deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of ſubverting this favorite maxim: but I am very deſirous it ſhould be properly qualified. The people have a right to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe their repreſentatives in certain caſes, in which they may be well informed: but this right cannot often be exerciſed with propriety or ſafety; nor ſhould their inſtructions be binding or their repreſentatives." Here is a right which cannot often be exerciſed with propriety or ſafety, and, when exerciſed, is not binding: a right, qualified by the logical dexterity of a lawyer, to be no right at all: a camelion kind of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ight, which, like the conſciences of ſome folks, aſſumes all ſhapes, but the ſhape of
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:028389_0435_0FD8EB898D32FF70"/>conſiſtency and of truth. But what is the reaſon that this is a right and no right—that it is to be exerciſed and not exerciſed —that it is a right, and not binding—and, like Mr. Dexter's republicaniſm, means any thing or nothing? Why, forſooth, "becauſe <hi>people live remote from each other,</hi> and cannot always be acquainted with the general intereſt of the ſtate; they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know all the reaſons which may be offered for or againſt a meaſure, by people in diſtant parts of the ſtate: they cannot tell at home, how they themſelves would think and act in a general aſſembly of all the citizens." So that becauſe every man is not omniſcient and omnipreſent, the people are to be deprived of all controul over their own repreſentatives. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this doctrine, legitimate human government never can exiſt. Let us conſider the tendency of theſe arguments. It is admitted, that, where the whole ſociety can convene, there is no neceſſity of repreſentation. But, according to Mr. Webſter's arguments, a ſociety could avail itſelf of no benefit or purpoſe, by actual convention of the whole; every individual being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, by his doctrine, of the right to vote; for as he cannot know the intereſts of the whole, therefore, he cannot decide upon any queſtion in which thoſe intereſts are involved. This doctrine of Webſter's is very ſimilar to Blackſtone's doctrine of the community of goods. The earth and all things thereon, ſays Blackſtone, was given by the creator to man, in common; but as it was given to man in common, no man could exerciſe private or particular dominion over any part of that which was given in common, without violating the community of goods; ſince the property belonged equally to all. But as it is plain ſuch a community of goods in practice, would be a mere nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; ſo is Mr. Webſter's community of intereſts. A whole ſociety meet in convention, to decide upon the intereſts of the whole: but this deciſion is impoſſible to be effected, according to Mr. Webſter's doctrine; for the individuals, or the parts of the ſociety, cannot vote; becauſe they are not the whole; but the whole includes all the parts; therefore, the whole cannot vote, becauſe the parts cannot; therefore, neither the parts nor the whole can vote; therefore, the whole is a mere nullity.</p>
                  <p>We are every day told, that a repreſentative is not only to repreſent the perſons who elected him, but he is to repreſent the whole ſtate; and, therefore, he cannot be bound by the opinion of his electors. If the fallacy of this argument be not already ſufficiently expoſed, we might deny that it can apply to the United States; as it contains the poſition of univerſal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation, which can only be bottomed upon univerſal elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a thing not known in theſe ſtates.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="149" facs="unknown:028389_0436_0FD8EB8A8C4520E8"/>
What ſort of a repreſentative would a perſon choſen in the diſtrict of Maine, or the territory north weſt of the Ohio, make for the people of South Carolina or Georgia? It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent at firſt bluſh, that ſuch a repreſentative might know no more of the intereſts of his pretended ſouthern conſtituents, than the man in the moon; and if a knowledge of the intereſts of the whole, be eſſential to enable a part of the people to give, with propriety, binding inſtructions to their repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, ſurely a little knowledge is neceſſary, to conſtitute a man a repreſentative of the whole; and how is the inhabitant of the diſtrict of Maine, to diſcover a knowledge of the intereſts of the people of Georgia? It may be anſwered, through the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of the repreſentatives of the people of Georgia. But may not the repreſentatives of Georgia, deceive the inhabitant of the diſtrict of Maine on this ſubject? and is it not abſurd to the laſt degree, to ſay that a repreſentative ought to deſert the intereſts of his own electors, with which he is well acquainted, in order to guard the intereſts of a people foreign to him; who are repreſented by expreſs delegations from themſelves; and of whom all his knowledge muſt be taken upon the truſt of other people? Such arguments, of univerſal repreſentation, cannot apply to the United States; becauſe the local diviſions of ſtates ſtill exiſt, and the repreſentation is founded upon local and not general principles. If, indeed, the repreſentatives were elected out of the whole union, they would be general, and not local repreſentatives; but even then, the principle, that the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative body is bound by the will of the body conſtituent, will hold good: as this principle is commenſurate with every poſſible degree of repreſentation. If the repreſentative is local, he may be reſtrained by local inſtructions. If he is general, or continental, he may be reſtrained by general, or continental inſtructions.</p>
                  <p>But it is ſaid that a man ought not to be ſettered with inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but ſhould be ſuffered to go independent to congreſs. I can form to myſelf the idea of the animal, repreſented by Horace, that had the body of an horſe, the head of a man, and the wings of a bird, but a truſtee independent of his truſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, an agent independent of his principal, or a repreſentative independent of his conſtituent, is a thing that I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; and to ſay that a repreſentative ought to go to congreſs unfettered with inſtructions, is very much like ſaying he ought to go to congreſs, not to repreſent his conſtituent, but to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent himſelf.</p>
                  <p>This ſort of logic, that in a free country a repreſentative is bound to repreſent himſelf, prevailed to ſuch a degree, about
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:028389_0437_0FD8EB8C2580EBF0"/>the time that the federal government was formed, that a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon choſen to repreſent Sandwich, in Maſſachuſetts, in conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, refuſed to be fettered, as he called it, and reſigned his appointment, becauſe his conſtituents inſtructed him to vote againſt the federal conſtitution. Among the reaſons urged by Mr. Bourne, the perſon in queſtion, for declining the ſervice of his fellow citizens, are the following: "Under the reſtrictions with which your delegates are fettered, the greateſt ideot may anſwer your purpoſe, as well as the greateſt man. The ſuffrages of our fellow men, when they neither repoſe confidence in our integrity, nor pay a tribute of reſpect to our abilities, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be agreeable." I am not diſpoſed to queſtion the ſincerity of Mr. Bourne, on this occaſion. His concluſions are, however, totally falſe; for it does not follow, becauſe a repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive is bound to expreſs the will of his conſtituents, that, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the greateſt ideot will anſwer the purpoſe as well as the greateſt man. Generals of armies, and admirals of navies, are almoſt always bound by inſtructions, and yet it never entered any man's head, that an ideot was a proper perſon to command an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my or a fleet; and if ſuch commander breaks his orders, he is ſure to get broke himſelf; and the maxim in commerce is, to break your owners rather than to break your orders. In ſhort, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Webſter's or Bourne's notions of ideotiſm may be, it is evident, that the wiſeſt man will always diſcharge the duties of a repreſentative beſt, however his inſtructions may be. The reſt of his arguments are equally ſtupid: for the ſuffrages of our fellow men are, in themſelves, the moſt ſacred depoſits of confidence in our integrity, and the moſt tranſcendent tributes of reſpect to our abilities, which we can poſſibly receive. And yet Mr. Webſter tell us, that he would rather be the author of this ſtupid addreſs, than all the laboured diſſertations written upon the federal conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>If the repreſentatives from any diſtrict are not bound by the opinions of ſuch diſtrict, but, on the contrary, are bound to conſider the intereſt of the United States, generally, then it may be aſked, with what propriety can the diſtrict diſplace the repreſentative, at the next election? and yet the diſtricts are veſted, by the conſtitution, with this power. Here are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, bound to attend to the general intereſts of the whole continent, and yet ſubject to be diſplaced by the diſtricts, for ſuch attention. It is evident, that the conſtitution, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioning the repreſentation to particular ſtates, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> tended, that the particular intereſts of each ſtate ſhould be ſpecially attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, by the repreſentation flowing from it. And all argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, controverting this evident principle, are more ſophiſtry,
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:028389_0438_0FD8EB8CAD302168"/>calculated to deceive, and pave the way for hereditary repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, or a repreſentation for life. For, if the principle is once admitted, as conſtitutional, that the repreſentatives from any ſtate are bound to attend to the general intereſt of the United States, the intereſt of their own ſtate to the contrary notwithſtanding, I ſee no reaſon why congreſs may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare themſelves hereditary legiſlators for the United States, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſitate rei;</hi> becauſe, if they are bound to maintain the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral welfare, they ought not to be controuled by partial inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts: and as the exerciſe of election manifeſts ſuch controul, it ought to be aboliſhed.</p>
                  <p>As this is a very important topic, I ſhall follow Mr. Web<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter a little. "The very doctrine of repreſentation in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, excludes the right of giving binding inſtructions to deputies. The deſign of chooſing repreſentatives, is, to collect the wiſdom of the ſtate; the deputies are to unite their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils; to meet and conſult for the public ſafety. But poſitive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions prevent this effect: they are dictated by local inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, or opinions formed on an imperfect view of facts and arguments; in ſhort, they totally counteract the good effects of public deliberations, and prevent thoſe ſalutary meaſures which may reſult from united councils. They make the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a ſmall part of the ſtate, the rule for the whole; they imply a deciſion of a queſtion, before it is heard; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a repreſentative to a mere machine, by reſtraining the exerciſe of his reaſon; they ſubvert the very principles of repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican government. And, further, a repreſentative is bound by oath to act according to his judgment, and for the good of the people: his inſtructions forbid him to uſe his judgment; he muſt then abandon either his orders, or his oath; perjury or diſobedience is his only alternative."</p>
                  <p>In anſwer to all this, it may be ſaid, that arguments, equally ſpecious, may be urged againſt the conſiſtency of the attributes of the deity, the exerciſe of religion, the utility of virtue, or even againſt the poſſibility of our exiſtence. But appearance is not reality, nor is ſpecious ſophiſtry, truth. If a man ſays two and two make five, and the half of five is three, I ſay, the man is either a fool or a knave; that he either is himſelf deceived, or ſeeks to deceive others. So, when Mr. Webſter tells us, that the doctrine of repreſentation excludes the right of giving binding inſtructions to deputies, he either does not underſtand the common acceptation of the word repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, or he means to play the ſophiſt. The meaning of the word repreſentation, is, bearing or exerciſing the character or power of another; and if the doctrine of bearing or exerciſing the
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:028389_0439_0FD8EB90241E9500"/>character or power of another, excludes the bearing or exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of ſuch character or power, then a thing is and is not; after which deduction, it would be folly in any man to reaſon with Mr. Webſter, were not the public intereſts involved in the deciſion.</p>
                  <p>But "The deſign of chooſing repreſentatives, is, to collect the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of the ſtate. This ſtatement is not correct; it ought to be the <hi>will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> the ſtate; for, however the wiſdom of a ſtate may be ſuppered to be manifeſted, in the debates of a legiſlative body, yet the deciſion is by vote, which is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of will, and not of wiſdom; as many perſons decide by vote, upon a queſtion, in the diſcuſſion of which they have been totally ſilent. And it frequently happens, that a minority have all the wiſdom and truth on their ſide, but are obliged to ſubmit to the will of the majority.</p>
                  <p>Again, "The deputies are to unite their councils, to meet and conſult for the public ſafety; but inſtructions prevent this effect." I will be bold to aſſert, that there never was on earth an union of councils, upon any great and intereſting queſtion; and, until liberty is ſwallowed up in deſpotiſm, there never will be. The celebrated declaration of independence was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by a majority of one only; the federal conſtitution met with much oppoſition, and the ſenate of the United States was equally divided, upon every queſtion, for ſeveral weeks of the laſt ſeſſion; ſo that, to effect this fancied union of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, which is as little to be expected as a ſimilarity in all our faces and diſpoſitions, and which, if effected, would prove the moſt intolerable of all tyrannies, the people of the United States are to be prevented from all controul over their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives.</p>
                  <p>Again, "They make the opinions of a ſmall part of the ſtate, a rule for the whole." An aſſertion of this kind could only have proceeded from a man, who, being educated in the habit of indiſcriminately ſupporting truth and falſehood, has loſt all diſtinct perceptions of both, and is calculated to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute, not to convince. If the repreſentatives in congreſs, from any particular ſtate, had the privilege of voting excluſively, and that ſuch votes of one ſtate ſhould bind the whole, there might be ſome truth in this aſſertion; but, when the whole repreſentatives, from all the ſtates, vote on the ſame queſtion, it is as difficult to conceive how a part can rule the whole, as it is to conceive that a part is greater than the whole.</p>
                  <p>But, "a repreſentative has ſworn to act according to his judgment; and his inſtructions forbid him to uſe his judgment; hence perjury or diſobedience is the alternative." Oaths have
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:028389_0440_0FD8EB9153191578"/>been thought neceſſary, in courts of juſtice, as obligations binding on the conſciences of men, over which the court can exerciſe no other controul; but the exerciſe of office is another matter, and, I preſume, the controul, which a properly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized body conſtituent has and preſerves over its repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, ſuperſedes the neceſſity of oaths altogether. But even if it did not, a man's judgment might, without any violation of his conſcience, dictate to him the impropriety of ſetting up his own will, in oppoſition to the will of his conſtituents.</p>
                  <p>It is the fate of ſophiſts, to be eternally contradicting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and this very gentleman, who has exhauſted ſo much rhetoric, to prove the impropriety of inſtructions to repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives, after telling us, that the powers of a repreſentative ſhould be wholly diſcretionary, when he acts as a legiſlator, ſays, "but, as an agent for a town or a ſmall ſociety, he may have poſitive inſtructions. His conſtituents, in the laſt caſe, are competent to inſtruct him, becauſe they are the whole body concerned; but, in the firſt inſtance, they are but part of the ſtate, and not competent to judge fully of the intereſts of the whole." I would beg leave to aſk him, if a town is a whole ſtate? it is not. How, then, can a town, according to Web<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's principles, give inſtructions? it cannot. But, after ſpin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out forty pages of ſophiſtry, he concedes all that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for, to wit, that towns may give binding inſtructions, becauſe they are the whole body concerned. But, in what ſenſe, is a town the whole body concerned? in no other ſenſe, but that the whole town is the whole body conſtituent; and no ſenſible man ever thought, that any part leſs than the whole, or a majority of the whole body conſtituent, could, of right, give binding inſtructions to the repreſentatives; but the whole body or a majority of the whole body conſtituent may; which, I believe, I have ſufficiently proved, and is conceded by Mr. Webſter.</p>

                     <p>BY this article, "the ſubjects of his Britannic majeſty have liberty to come, with their ſhips and cargoes, to the lands, countries, cities, ports, places, and rivers, within the whole extent of the United States, to enter into the ſame, to reſort, remain, and reſide there, without any limitation of time, alſo to hire and poſſeſs houſes and ware-houſes, for the purpoſe of their commerce, and in which they are to enjoy the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete protection and ſecurity." As this article excludes a Britiſh ſubject from <hi>no part</hi> of the United States, it might be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that our citizens, in return, ſhould enjoy the ſame liberty of trading to and reſiding within <hi>every part</hi> of the Britiſh ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories. —No ſuch thing—By it we can only go to a ſmall part of his majeſty's dominions, viz. <hi>thoſe in Europe,</hi> where we have been in the habit of going ever ſince the peace, without any treaty, and without any moleſtation, Great Britain finding her intereſt in permitting us ſo to do.—Our envoy, ever true to the principle of inequality, which he has made the baſis of his treaty, has brought it into conſpicuous action in this place; as if anxious to circumſcribe our commerce, he never loſes an opportunity of impoſing ſome reſtrictions or limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on it.</p>

                     <p>Upon this article, no other obſervation is neceſſary, than that it tends very unneceſſarily to ſhackle the government, in regulating our commerce with foreign nations, which, by the conſtitution, is veſted in congreſs, and that it muſt always have been a matter of much ſolicitude with Great Britain, to prevent our paſſing ſuch diſcrimination laws, on this ſubject, as cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and neceſſity might render proper.—The reader is left to diſcover what benefit we can derive from it.—Paſſing over the 16th article, which regulates the appointment of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls, we come to thoſe parts of the treaty which have ever appeared to me the moſt exceptionable. I mean thoſe which regulate our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe and comme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap> with other nations, in times of Britiſh wars. Was a ſtranger, unacquainted with the hiſtory of the
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:028389_0442_0FD8EB948E98ADD8"/>two contracting parties, to peruſe this compact, he would ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the United States were almoſt conſtantly engaged in war, and that her envoy, jealous of the neutral ſituation of Great Britain, and afraid of the ſupplies ſhe might furniſh to the enemies of his country, had taken care to impoſe every reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he could think of, on her commerce and action, during thoſe periods of hoſtility. What would be his ſurpriſe, if, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter drawing this concluſion, he was informed, that the United States, except the war which emancipated them, have never been embroiled in any foreign quarrel? That, on the contrary, the ambition or injuſtice of Great Britain urges her to take part in almoſt every war which breaks out in Europe or Aſia; that America is nearly 3000 miles from the ſcene of action, and the vortex of European politics; that ſhe is a peaceable, commercial nation; that her intereſt conſiſts in obſerving a ſtrict neutrality, <hi>not</hi> by withholding all ſupplies from the belli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent powers, and ſullenly ſhutting her ports againſt them all, but by an open, unreſerved, and equal communication and trade with all of them. Inſtead of this, we ſhall find, in ſome of 'the articles which follow, the moſt unheard-of reſtrictions upon our commerce, and the moſt wanton ſacrifices of the thouſand advantages which we were entitled to, as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial country; principles, which this country, in common with ſeveral other maritime powers, had advocated and adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for a ſeries of years, have been moſt wantonly abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Articles, which were never before eſteemed contraband, have been inſerted in the black liſt; and ſuch is the conſtant ſpirit of the parts to which I allude, that not an American veſſel can croſs the ocean, in time of war, without manifeſt hazard of becoming lawful prize to a Britiſh cruiſer.—A more minute attention to this part of the treaty, will but too much juſtify obſervations, which, at firſt view, may appear harſh and ill-founded. To elucidate more fully the ſtriking inequality of theſe parts of the treaty, they will be contraſted with thoſe which we have with other nations.—The taſk will be painful and nauſeous; in every line we ſhall encounter ſome new ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; at every period, we ſhall execrate the reſult of a miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which has fixed an indelible ſtain upon our national honor, and publiſhed to the world, that we no longer deſerve to be free.</p>

                     <head>Article XVII.</head>
                     <p>"It is agreed, that, in all caſes where veſſels ſhall be cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured or detained, on juſt <hi>ſuſpicion</hi> of having on board ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's property, or of carrying to the enemy any of the articles, which are contraband of war, the ſaid veſſel ſhall be brought

And it is agreed, that all proper meaſures ſhall be taken to prevent delay, in deciding the caſes of ſhips or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes ſo brought in for adjudication, and in the payment or recovery of any indemnification, adjudged or agreed to be paid to the maſters or owners of ſuch ſhips."</p>
                     <p>In this article we have ſolemnly relinquiſhed a point, which, to us, was of more value than the amount of all the depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on our trade, added to the immenſe ſums due to us, for the negroes, and to the loſſes we have ſuſtained, by the deten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our poſts. As a neutral and trading people, and as a nation, likely, with common prudence, ever to continue at peace with all the world, we ſhould have inſiſted, even at the riſque of war, eſpecially when making a treaty, that <hi>free veſſels ſhould make free goods.</hi> With what people are we afraid of going to war, that we are ſo anxious to reſtrain the veſſels of Great Britain from carrying their effects? There is but one country with which our government appears ſolicitous to embroil us, and that is France. Should ſuch a war really take place (which God forbid, as it would certainly be followed by a civil one) is it probable Great Britain would become carriers for the French? and if ſhe did, would our government dare to authorize her citizens to make prize of any property on board of her veſſels? What would we not ſubmit to, in time of war, if, when not preſſed by this calamity, we ſacrifice a principle for which we have been contending ever ſince we became a nation, and which we have uniformly adhered to, in our conventions with other nations? As early as 1781, it was an inſtruction to the captains of American armed veſſels, that they ſhould permit all "neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral veſſels freely to navigate on the high ſeas or coaſt of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, except ſuch, as were employed in carrying <hi>contraband goods, or ſoldiers to the enemies of the United States.</hi>" Jour. of Cong. 7. vol. p. 80. What were then deemed contraband goods will be ſhown, when we come to conſider the next article of this <hi>memorable treaty.</hi> Several of the maritime and commercial ſtates of Europe, had already armed to maintain their neutrality; and congreſs, we ſee, not only reſpected the principle of this aſſociation, but did all they could to give it complete operation, by a ſolemn ordinance, which they paſſed on the 7th of April, 1781. It need not be contended, that there is no nation on earth ſo much intereſted and benefited by the obſervance of this principle, as America. Let us attend only to the preſent
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:028389_0444_0FD8EB9C99A9BF78"/>war: what benefit might we not derive from it, if our veſſels could afford protection to the property of belligerent powers? Having ſeen that congreſs, even in time of war (it will be remembered, that America was then without a ſenate devoted to Great Britain, and that thoſe who were then deemed patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots, were really ſuch) when it might have been her intereſt to purſue the wicked, piratical ſyſtem of Great Britain, reſpected the rights of neutrality, and would not touch the property of her enemy, if found on board of a neutral veſſel; and all her treaties hitherto, have ſecured to her this important, this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

The diſguſt occaſioned by the former will not be much diminiſhed, while we peruſe the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. "It ſhall be lawful," ſays this article, "for all and ſingular, the ſubjects of the moſt Chriſtian king, and the citizens, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and inhabitants of the ſaid United States, to ſail with their ſhips, with <hi>all manner of liberty, and ſecurity, no diſtinction being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And it is hereby ſtipulated that <hi>free ſhips</hi> ſhall alſo give a <hi>freedom</hi> to <hi>goods;</hi> and that every thing ſhall be deemed to be free and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt which ſhall be found on board the ſhips belonging to the ſubjects of either of the confederates, although the whole lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or any part thereof ſhould appertain to the enemies of either, contraband goods being always excepted. It is alſo agreed in like manner, that the ſame liberty be extended to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who are on board a free ſhip, with their effects; that although they be enemies to both or either party, they are not to be taken out of that free ſhip, unleſs they are ſoldiers, and in actual ſervice of the enemies."</p>
                     <p>If Mr. Pitt had graciouſly permitted Mr. Jay to inſert a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſtipulation in the treaty before us, in what an envied ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                  <head>Remarks on Mr. Charles Pinckney's Speech.</head>
                  <p>[CONCLUDED FROM PAGE 111.]</p>
                  <p>WITH reſpect to the negociation about the Miſſiſſippi, in 1786, which ſeems to be dragged in here without any obvious propriety, it may be remembered, that Mr. Jay's opinion, on that occaſion, had the ſanction of a majority of congreſs—that it was <hi>then</hi> thought, by many of the wiſeſt men in America, a ſalutary arrangement for the <hi>Atlantic ſtates</hi>— that the eaſtern ſtates were generally of that opinion—that a minority in congreſs, for the benefit of a ſmall part of the union, obſtructed a meaſure which was then deemed generally be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al—and that even <hi>now</hi> it may be conſidered as problematical, whether the arrangement would not have eventuated more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficially for the weſtern territory than any other which can be promiſed.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>inſinuation</hi> againſt <hi>the preſident,</hi> for having ſent a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> who has ſhown himſelf "ſo uninformed of the commecial intereſts of his country, and ſo miſerably deficient in the talents of a negociator, and for having oppoſed him ſingly, and at their own court, to the talents, experience, and, perhaps, <hi>temptations</hi> of their ableſt ſtateſmen," will fail of its intended effect. Mr. Jay's conduct in Spain, in France at the treaty of 1783, his talents and experience, and <hi>known integrity,</hi> were ſufficient inducements with the preſident to ſelect him for this miſſion. There may indeed be <hi>men,</hi> whoſe <hi>vanity</hi> may lead them to believe, that <hi>they</hi> would have negociated a better trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty—men, no more to be compared to Mr. Jay, for <hi>virtue or abilities,</hi> than a farthing candle to the ſun, and whoſe <hi>vanity,</hi> in ſuppoſing themſelves his ſuperiors, in theſe reſpects, can only be ſurpaſſed by their <hi>folly,</hi> in having had <hi>pretenſions and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> ſo ill-founded and ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>In complaining of the article relating to Britiſh debts, the ſpeech obſerves, that the creditors had long ſince made up their minds on certain points, and that by far the greater number of caſes have been ſettled by ſuit or compromiſe; ſo much the better; all thoſe caſes, in which the creditors have been ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, will not be touched by the treaty. The article will only affect the others, where the debtors are inſolvent. If Mr. Jay, in his negociation of the treaty of 1783, honeſtly meant, that
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:028389_0448_0FD8EBA5C31058F8"/>bona fide debts were to be paid, it would have been inconſiſtent in him to deny it, either as judge or ſecretary of foreign affairs: <hi>Humanity</hi> is perhaps as much concerned in paying a fair debt to a factor or agent in England, who had ſhipped goods to this country, and was reſponſible to the manufacturers, and liable to be impriſoned there for non-payment, as in ſhielding from the law a rich debtor in this, who withheld payment: <hi>Honor</hi> as much required that our national faith ſhould be kept, and that bona fide debts ſhould be paid by ſolvent debtors. The ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation agreed to by Mr. Jay is not to diſtreſs individuals, but to make the nation anſwerable for loſſes ariſing from a breach of the treaty.</p>
                  <p>On the ſubject of ſpoliations, the ſpeech chalks out the line of conduct Mr. Jay ſhould have taken: "He ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired <hi>immediate</hi> ſatisfaction; if refuſed, he ſhould have <hi>quitted</hi> their court, and left it to his country to have determined what other meaſures were to be purſued: but, inſtead of this, he has accepted a <hi>remote, expenſive,</hi> and uncertain remedy." This is the line of conduct the ſpeaker would leave taken: "his demand ſhould have been <hi>ſpirited</hi> and poſitive—no alternative would have been offered." But ſuppoſe his inſtructions had not been of that <hi>ſpirited</hi> and poſitive nature, and that <hi>ſome other alternative</hi> had been pointed out by them—and he had diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, after having accepted the miſſion, knowing thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions? On his return, he would have been univerſally condemned, and ſome other <hi>leſs poſitive</hi> gentleman would have been ſent. The former miniſter at that court, as diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his ſpirit as his virtues, but whoſe ſpirit, regulated by good ſenſe and ſound diſcretion, would have been more wiſely directed, complained for ſeveral months to the Britiſh court, of the ſpoliations committed under the orders of the 8th of June, 1793, without threatening to quit the country: in this, he conformed to the inſtructions of the executive; in Mr. Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferſon's letter to Mr. Pinckney, of September 7, 1793, after complaining of thoſe ſpoliations, he adds, "The preſident, therefore, deſires that you will immediately enter into expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, on this ſubject, with the Britiſh government. Lay before them, in <hi>friendly</hi> and <hi>temperate</hi> terms, all the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of the injury done us by this act, and endeavour to obtain a revocation of it, and full indemnification to any citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of theſe ſtates, who may have ſuffered by it in the mean time. Accompany your repreſentations with every <hi>aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of our earneſt deſire to live on terms of the beſt friendſhip</hi> and <hi>harmony</hi> with them, and to found our expectations of juſtice on their part, on a ſtrict obſervance of it on ours. Deſirous of
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:028389_0449_0FD8EBA8524D16D0"/>furniſhing no colour of offence, we do not wiſh you to name to them <hi>any term for giving an anſwer:</hi> urge one as much as you can, <hi>without commitment.</hi>" The remedy accepted by Mr. Jay, is probably the remedy deſignated in his inſtructions; it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the uſual remedy in ſimilar caſes. But it is called <hi>remote;</hi> and what would the ſpeech have ſubſtituted? Why Mr. Jay muſt have quitted Great Britain, made his report to the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, who muſt thereupon have convened the ſenate, according to the doctrine laid down in the ſpeech, to reconſider their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and, after all, at the diſtance of many months, the ſenate would have done preciſely what they have done—adviſed the preſident to accept the terms: Mr. Jay would have returned to England, and this <hi>remote</hi> remedy would have been made <hi>more remote</hi> by at leaſt a twelvemonth: it is called <hi>expenſive;</hi> and what would the ſpeech ſubſtitute? Why, Mr. Jay muſt have returned home, and the United States, after the expenſe of ſome thouſand dollars for the extra ſeſſion of the ſenate, muſt either have had the expenſe of another embaſſy, or the more ſerious expenſe of <hi>ten or fifteen millions of dollars</hi> by a war, to obtain a compenſation of <hi>half a million!!</hi> The remedy pointed out by the ſpeech does not then appear preferable to Mr. Jay's.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Jay is next charged with having, in the moſt condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner, <hi>ſtipulated</hi> that <hi>all</hi> prizes brought in, &amp;c. ſhall be paid for, &amp;c. Mr. Jay <hi>ſtipulated</hi> no ſuch thing. The preſident and ſtipulated in 1793, that <hi>certain</hi> prizes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s ſpecified in Mr. Jefferſon's letter, annexed to the treaty, ſhould be paid for. Mr. Jay, conformably to that letter and his inſtructions, agrees that the caſes not already paid for, coming within the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples therein fixed, ſhall be referred to the commiſſioners.</p>
                  <p>After the ſpeech had informed us that the 12th article was held in general deteſtation by our own citizens, it may appear ſuperfluous to add the deteſtation of <hi>foreigners.</hi> The deteſtation of <hi>our own citizens</hi> was quite ſufficient to condemn it. But the flouriſh about our friends ſeems miſapplied. The articles, prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by that article, are molaſſes, ſugar, coffee, cocoa, and cotton: It may be <hi>queried</hi> whether our veſſels carry much of them to ſupply our friends; the general courſe of the preſent trade of re-export in thoſe articles, ſeems to be to other parts of Europe. It is not, however, meant to contend this point, with thoſe <hi>who have obtained the beſt mercantile information.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The animadverſion on the article reſpecting the Eaſt India trade, is either not underſtood, or the article itſelf is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the commentator. It permits the citizens of the United States "to carry on freely a trade between the Britiſh territories in the Eaſt Indies and the United States, in all arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:028389_0450_0FD8EBA948523408"/>of which the importation or exportation reſpectively, to or from the ſaid territories, ſhall not be entirely prohibited; that is, it places our citizens upon the ſame footing exactly as the Eaſt India company, and upon <hi>a better footing than the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Great Britain,</hi> who cannot carry on ſuch trade. Becauſe advantages favorable to the United States are conceded in this article, the notable diſcovery is now made, that the trade is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious; ſo the ſame perſons, who a few years ago would have rejoiced at a ſtipulation, permitting our veſſels of 60 tons to enter the Britiſh iſlands, now call the ſtipulation for 70 tons a <hi>paltry</hi> allowance. Had the Britiſh poſſeſſions in the Eaſt Indies been ſhut to us by the treaty, what clamour ſhould we not have heard at being deprived of ſuch ineſtimable advantages?</p>
                  <p>It has been aſſerted, in the courſe of theſe obſervations, that the complaint againſt Mr. Jay. for recognizing the right to ſearch our veſſels on ſuſpicion of having on board enemy's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, is ill ſounded: A recurrence to <hi>Vattel, whoſe authority,</hi> the ſpeech tells us, is <hi>not to be doubted,</hi> and to Mr. Jefferſon's letters, authorities equally undoubted, will confirm the aſſertion. Preſent experience proves, that the ſpeaker is altogether miſtaken, when he ſays, "that, if we recognize this right, we muſt give up the idea of benefitting by the diſſentions of European powers, and becoming their carriers, and that our commerce will be proſtrated at the ſect of the maritime powers." One would ſuppoſe, that <hi>a perſon who had obtained the beſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantile information,</hi> would have known, that, notwithſtanding Mr. Jefferſon, our ſecretary of ſtate, in conformity with the doctrine of <hi>that undoubted authority, Vattel,</hi> did, two years ago, recognize that right, and the Britiſh veſſels of war have conſtantly exerciſed it, yet that <hi>our carrying trade has increaſed, and our commerce has flouriſhed, within the two laſt years, in a manner unexampled in the hiſtory of nations.</hi> And what is very extraordinary, the ſpeaker, in contradiction to his own aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in this place, tells us in another, that the <hi>American com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and navigation flouriſhed</hi> beyond all former example and <hi>almoſt to exceed belief;</hi> and that <hi>now, American</hi> merchants, in Charleſton, carry on all the trade, and own more than ſixty veſſels of large ſize, and a much greater proportion of ſmaller veſſels in the Weſt India trade; all this, in ſpite of the recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of that alarming right made two years ago, and in ſpite of the conſtant exerciſe of it, which is, <hi>to deſtroy our carrying trade</hi> and <hi>proſtrate our commerce!</hi> To be ſure, there muſt have been a wonderful exertion of ingenuity to collect together in one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of a newſpaper, ſo many contradictions!</p>

                     <pb n="164" facs="unknown:028389_0451_0FD8EBAACD97C450"/>
This part of the treaty ſeems to be the moſt offenſive to the ſpeaker; it is the article which has brought down upon Mr. Jay his moſt ſevere reprobation; he conſiders it the moſt import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, the <hi>moſt ſeriouſly injurious to our commerce;</hi> and if there had been no other objection, Mr. Jay ſhould have refuſed to ſign the treaty. And yet, wonderful to relate, it is perfectly conformable to the law of nations, as laid down by that <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted authority, Vattel;</hi> it is recognized by our government, and, under the exerciſe of it, inſtead of the moſt <hi>ſerious injury</hi> to our commerce, <hi>our commerce and navigation have flouriſhed, almoſt to exceed belief.</hi> In ſhort, if there is any part of the treaty leſs liable to objection than another, <hi>this is the article.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To compel Great Britain and other maritime powers (for the northern powers have now given up this point) to change the acknowledged law of nations, the ſpeech recommends the eſtabliſhment of a navy of twelve ſail of the line and a few frigates. However ſuch a thing may be deſirable, and may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be expedient, the idea of an early eſtabliſhment of that kind is perfectly chimerical. To protect our commerce from the depredations of the Algerines, congreſs reſolved, in Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, 1794, to build and equip ſix frigates: <hi>At this day,</hi> the keels are ſcarcely laid; when they will be launched, God knows; when that happens, there is but little proſpect of their being manned; and if they are, they will float at an expenſe of a million and a half of dollars outfit, and half a million of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual expenſe, without allowing for misfortunes or contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. —What the expenſe of the ſpeaker's <hi>navy</hi> will be, may be eaſily computed. Seven or eight millions of dollars for outfit, and two or three millions of annual expenſe, will not come up to the mark. Nor is that the principal difficulty: This fleet will be wanted during the wars of the maritime powers, to protect our commerce and preſerve our neutral rights.—But, on theſe occaſions, the extenſion of our carrying trade abſorbs all our ſeamen; and if any could be obtained for the public ſhips, it would be at an intolerable expenſe. If we ſhould be at war, then the ſpirit of privateering would draw off the greateſt part of our ſeamen. And after all, what would ten or twelve ſhips of the line and a few frigates accompliſh, when oppoſed to the enormous fleets of the maritime powers of Europe? Whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, therefore, we may do in the article of a navy ſome years hence, it is ſelf-evident, that our ſtrength and reſources muſt at preſent be applied againſt our enemies in a very different ſhape.</p>
                  <p>On the 14th and 15th articles, it is remarked in the ſpeech, that the firſt clauſe places the veſſels of America on the ſame
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:028389_0452_0FD8EBACCA750850"/>footing with thoſe of other foreign nations, <hi>which is as much as we could of right expect, conſiſtent with their obligations to other nations:</hi> But that by this rule, American veſſels going to their European ports pay from 15 <abbr>l.</abbr> to 20 <abbr>l.</abbr> on a veſſel of 150 to 200 tons, more than a Britiſh veſſel. Certainly we cannot complain, if we are put on the footing of the moſt favored nation: as to the extra duty, paid by American veſſels in all the ports of England, <hi>but London,</hi> for <hi>light money,</hi> which is one ſhilling and nine-pence per ton, it is the ſame as is paid by all other foreign nations; in all other reſpects, our ſhips are upon the <hi>ſame footing</hi> with thoſe of Great Britain. It is here worthy of remark, that the <hi>extra</hi> duty paid in the United States by a Britiſh veſſel, more than an American, is greater than the <hi>extra</hi> duty paid in Great Britain by an American veſſel, more than a Britiſh; for example, in the United States an American veſſel pays ſix cents, a Britiſh fifty cents, per ton; the difference on a veſſel of 200 tons is twenty pounds ten ſhillings and eight-pence, and on a veſſel of 300 tons, twenty-nine pounds ſixteen ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings—beſides the difference of ten per cent on the duties; whereas the difference in England, in favor of a Britiſh veſſel of 200 tons, is only ſeventeen pounds ten ſhillings, and of 300, only twenty-ſix pounds five ſhillings, and no diſcrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the duties: And, in one reſpect, our veſſels are on a <hi>better footing</hi> in England than thoſe of the moſt favored nation; for while they pay upon the carriage of ſeveral of their own commodities, additional duties, called <hi>alien duties,</hi> our ſhips are exempt from them.</p>
                  <p>In 1789, congreſs laid a tonnage duty of 25 cents per ton on all foreign veſſels, and made the diſcrimination of ten per cent. on the duties on goods imported, in favor of American bottoms, as above mentioned. In 1790, the tonnage duty was increaſed to 50 cents, not in conſequence of the preſident's meſſage, as ſtated in the ſpeech, which was in February 179<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> (not 1790). That meſſage provoked no commercial reſtriction <hi>at that time,</hi> but was the foundation of a reference to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of ſtate, which produced his report, in January 1794. An examination of this part of the ſpeech furniſhes another ſtriking contradiction; it is here ſaid, "that our fellow citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens at the northward have had excluſively the <hi>India trade,</hi> by which, beſides ſupplying our own citizens with Aſiatic goods, at <hi>one fourth</hi> the price they were before the revolution, they have <hi>exported them to the Weſt Indies, and even to Europe, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby the balance of trade more favorable to the United States.</hi>" The ſpeaker, in thus excelling the benefits of the Eaſt India trade, muſt aſſuredly have <hi>forgot</hi> his attempt to <hi>diſparage</hi> that
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:028389_0453_0FD8EBB117F03C20"/>trade, in a preceding paragraph, where he was obliged to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſome advantage acquired by the treaty, and his having therein ſaid, "that the <hi>advantage</hi> was <hi>deluſive;</hi> that an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive trade to the Eaſt Indies was <hi>injurious;</hi> becauſe, at an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe expenſe, we import from thence nothing but articles of mere luxury, moſt of which, except tea, we could do very well without, or procure elſewhere, in exchange for our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions; and they take from us, in payment, ſcarcely any thing but ſpecie."</p>
                  <p>Theſe reſtrictions, on the part of our government, it is ſaid, did not produce any counter reſtrictions, on the part of England. But the merchants of ſeveral large commercial cities in Great Britain, as appears by the report to the privy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, in the ſpring 1791, <hi>did complain</hi> of them as being <hi>un-reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal,</hi> as impoſing burdens on their navigation and commerce in our ports, which they did not impoſe on our navigation and commerce in theirs. In fact, the ſole diſcrimination of ten per cent. on the duties in favor of American bottoms, ſecond nearly the monopoly of the carriage of the manufactures of Great Britain to this country, and was ſeverely felt by the ſhip-owners of theſe cities. They were wiſe enough, however, to recommend <hi>negociation</hi> inſtead of <hi>retaliation</hi> to the privy council, Mr. Hammond was ſent to the United States; and our government conceiving, that, notwithſtanding we had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed certain reſtrictions on the commerce of England, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> our intercourſe was not on ſuch a footing as we had a right to expect: Mr. Jefferſon, in his very firſt letter to Mr. Hammond, of 29th November, 1791, ſays, "with reſpect to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of the two countries, we have ſuppoſed that we ſaw, in ſeveral inſtances, regulations on the part of your government, which, if reciprocally adopted, would materially injure the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of both nations: On this ſubject, too, I muſt beg the favor of you to ſay, whether you are authorized to conclude or to negociate arrangements with us, which may fix the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce between the two countries on principles of reciprocal advantage?" In reply to this letter, Mr. Hammond aſſured him, that though he was not authorized to <hi>conclude,</hi> yet he was fully authorized to <hi>enter on</hi> a negociation on that ſubject: Mr. Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferſon, conceiving that ſuch authority was inadequate, drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the ſubject, and confined his enſuing negociations entirely to the infractions of the treaty. Theſe facts, while they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate that a diſpoſition exiſted, on the part of our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo long ago as November, 1791, to enter into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial treaty with England, exculpate, at the ſame time, Mr.
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:028389_0454_0FD8EBB309D10020"/>Jay, altogether, from the charges inſinuated againſt him of having volunteered theſe commercial arrangements.</p>
                  <p>The ſpeech proceeds to obſerve, that "at this moment Mr. Jay <hi>concedes,</hi> in the ſecond ſection of the 15th article, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing proviſo. "But the Britiſh government reſerves to itſelf the right of impoſing on American veſſels, entering into the Britiſh ports in Europe, a tonnage duty equal to that which ſhall be payable by Britiſh veſſels in the ports of America, and alſo ſuch duty as may be adequate to countervail the difference of duty now payable on the importation of European and Aſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atic goods, when imported into the United States, in Britiſh or American veſſels." There is <hi>no conceſſion</hi> by Mr. Jay: the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh government actually poſſeſſed the right to lay ſuch counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing duties, and might have exerciſed it whenever it was thought expedient; it could not be expected that, after declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the intercourſe between the two countries ſhould be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on, on principles of perfect reciprocity, we ſhould inſiſt on continuing certain diſcriminating duties, and bind the other party up from reciprocating them: this would have been incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with ourſelves, after making the want of reciprocity on their part, the baſis of our commercial complaints. The ſpeech it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in another place, acknowledges that their receiving our veſſels on the ſame footing as other foreign nations, "was perhaps as much as we could of right expect, conſiſtent with their obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to other nations;" and yet, it has been ſhown that in ſome inſtances, our veſſels are, by exiſting regulations, received on better terms than thoſe of other nations. This being the caſe, could we expect that they ſhould ſurrender by treaty, a right which <hi>we</hi> reſerve to <hi>ourſelves,</hi> and which <hi>they</hi> have reſerved in relation to <hi>all other nations?</hi> The French have reſerved in their treaty with us, a ſimilar right; and no nation can ever be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to relinquiſh it.</p>
                  <p>The ſtipulation, "that the United States will not impoſe any new or additional tonnage duties, on Britiſh veſſels, nor increaſe the now ſubſiſting difference between the duties pay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on the importation of any articles in Britiſh or American veſſels," is ſaid, in the ſpeech, to be calculated "to induce the Britiſh ſhippers to refuſe a credit to our merchants, unleſs they ſhip their goods in Britiſh bottoms."</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Credit</hi> being, in the opinion of many modern theoriſts, a very bad thing, if the clauſe ſhould produce the expected ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, it will, in their opinion, certainly do ſome good. But it is ſurpriſing that this operation ſhould not have taken place ever ſince the year 1789, when the difference of duties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced. The operation has, during a period of ſix years been
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:028389_0455_0FD8EBB4AD8C8D90"/>quite the reverſe of the ſpeaker's ſuggeſtion; for notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the difference of tonnage duty and the diſcrimination of ten per cent. the Britiſh merchants have ſhipped their goods in American bottoms, and given the uſual credit to our merchants; and the ſpeaker tells us, that by the operation of thoſe duties, <hi>our commerce and navigation have flouriſhed almoſt to exceed belief.</hi> How then an agreement <hi>not</hi> to increaſe thoſe duties ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke an hoſtility of diſpoſition on the part of the Britiſh mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, which has not for ſix years exiſted, when there was <hi>no</hi> ſuch agreement not to increaſe them, is not eaſily diſcovered!! The ſpeech ſays further, on this article, "That it is not an extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant idea to preſume, that the wealth of the Britiſh Eaſt India company may be employed to cruſh the American merchants now in this trade (meaning, I ſuppoſe, the Eaſt India trade) that they afterwards may enjoy the monopoly of it."</p>
                  <p>If the reſtrictions on Britiſh Eaſt India veſſels have been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto ſo effectual as "to ſecure the excluſive trade to our north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern fellow citizens," as the ſpeech informs us, it does not well appear how agreeing not to increaſe thoſe reſtrictions will give the monopoly to the Britiſh; the idea, if not extravagant, is certainly a very extraordinary one. The import of this article is merely, that we will not increaſe the diſcriminations now ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting; why ſhould we, when they have been found <hi>ſufficient</hi> to raiſe our commerce and navigation to a pitch of proſperity <hi>almoſt to exceed belief</hi>—when we thereby prevent the other party from impoſing on our commerce higher than correſponding du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and when, in fact, the whole article will be again in our power <hi>in the courſe of two or three years?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is then ſaid, "that by treaties now exiſting with other nations, they are to be uſed as the moſt favored nation—and having of right the ſame privilege of counteracting the diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating duties, they will, of courſe, exerciſe it." And have they not ſuch a right at preſent? unqueſtionably. Can we now impoſe on any nation with whom we have a treaty, any diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating duties, which ſhe cannot counteract? And if, poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that right, the diſcriminating duties which have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for ſix years, have not had injurious conſequences, but on the contrary have raiſed our commerce and navigation to the higheſt proſperity, then none but the <hi>meaneſt</hi> capacity can ſee in this clauſe the ſpeedy and total deſtruction of American na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation.</p>
                  <p>We are next told, that by other articles of the treaty, the catalogue of contraband articles is increaſed, and attempts are made to make even <hi>proviſions</hi> come under this deſcription. With reſpect to <hi>proviſions,</hi> the article ſeems miſunderſtood. <hi>Vatth,

                        </gap>ted,</hi> the authority of Vattel, and has diſputed with the Britiſh go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment the right, under the law of nations, to ſeize provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as <hi>contraband</hi> in thoſe caſes. After diſcuſſions on that point, what is ſtipulated in the treaty? The Britiſh government en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, that whenever proviſions ſhall become contraband, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the exiſting <hi>law of nations,</hi> they <hi>ſhall not be confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,</hi> but the owners ſhall be indemnified, with a reaſonable mercantile profit, with freight and demurrage. What then was Mr. Jay given up? It is expreſsly ſtipulated, that the ſeizures ſhall be only in caſes where they are warranted by <hi>the exiſting law of nations:</hi> Mr. Jay refuſed to acknowledge that they were contraband by the law of nations in any particular caſe; he would not conſent to a ſpecification of any one caſe; he would not ſtipulate for any one thing which might preclude us from <hi>denying the exiſtence</hi> of ſuch a law of nations: the introductory part of the clauſe is, therefore, to this effect; "whereas the <hi>difficulty</hi> of agreeing on the <hi>preciſe caſes,</hi> in which <hi>alone,</hi> provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and other articles, not generally contraband, may be regarded as ſuch, renders it expedient to provide againſt the inconveniencies and miſunderſtandings which might thence ariſe," &amp;c. If the Britiſh government inſiſted, that in certain caſes mentioned, proviſions were contraband, and Mr. Jay inſiſted that they were not, and on appealing to <hi>Vattel,</hi> it was found that ſuch was the opinion of that writer—if, further, the law of nations was ſuppoſed to give, in the caſes mentioned, the right not only of ſeizing, but of <hi>confiſcating</hi> ſuch proviſions, and there was no other mode of deciding ultimately on the right, but by an appeal to the ſword; Mr. Jay may have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that he was making the beſt terms for our citizens, by ſtipulating, that where, by <hi>the exiſting law of nations,</hi> and in thoſe caſes only, proviſions ſhould be contraband, that they ſhould <hi>not be confiſcated,</hi> but paid for with a mercantile profit, and freight and demurrage. By this clauſe, nothing appears to be given up by our government, which may continue to <hi>deny</hi> the exiſtence of ſuch right, under the law of nations, and to reſiſt it either by remonſtrance, by commercial regulations, or by arms. In the mean time, and until the queſtion ſhall be decided, our citizens will be paid for their property, inſtead of having it confiſcated.</p>
                  <p>But admitting the clauſe to be an injurious one, the ſpeaker, of all perſons, ſeems to be <hi>the leaſt entitled to complain.</hi> He has
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:028389_0457_0FD8EBBB48624550"/>told us that <hi>Vattel</hi> is an author of <hi>undoubted authority,</hi> and he has alſo told us, "that if Mr. Jay had attempted to ſay a word in favor of the claims of his countrymen, <hi>his opponent had only to ſhow him his own opinions, and his lips muſt have been inſtantly cloſed.</hi>" Suppoſe, then, the ſpeaker, inſtead of Mr. Jay, had been ſent on this miſſion, and Lord Grenville had diſcovered, in the courſe of the negociation, that the ſpeaker thought <hi>Vattel</hi> a writer of <hi>undoubted authority,</hi> and, that on his denying the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity under the law of nations to make proviſions contraband in any caſe whatever, Lord Grenville had produced an aſſertion from Vattel to this effect, that "all proviſions are to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as contraband, and as ſuch <hi>liable to confiſcation,</hi> in the caſe where the depriving an enemy of theſe ſupplies, is one of the means intended to be employed for reducing him to reaſonable terms of peace:" What could our negociator have replied? "Had he attempted to ſay a word in favor of the claims of his countrymen, <hi>his opponent had only to ſhow him his own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and his lips muſt have been inſtantly cloſed.</hi>" According, then, to his own aſſertions and doctrines, Mr. Jay has obtained much better terms, in relation to this point, than <hi>he</hi> could have done. He proceeds to remark, that "whenever there is a war between the maritime powers, the danger of ſeizure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to us will be as great <hi>as if we were actually at war ourſelves.</hi>" The experience of the laſt two years, and his own ſtatement of the <hi>flouriſhing ſtate of our navigation,</hi> during that period, are ſufficient refutations of that aſſertion.</p>
                  <p>In his comments on the 23d, 24th, and 25th articles, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly charges Mr. Jay with endeavoring to render this country as unfriendly as he could to the French; and nothing can be more unfounded than the whole of this charge; there is not a tittle of it which can bear the teſt of truth; there is not a tittle of thoſe three articles which can produce any ſuch effect; there is not an argument to prove it; the whole is mere vague decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. One would ſuppoſe, that a perſon who had taken ſo much pains to acquire the beſt mercantile information, and who had ſo high an opinion of <hi>Vattei's</hi> authority, would have beſtowed ſome pains on a peruſal of the French treaty, on the peruſal of the treaty under conſideration, and then would have read <hi>Vattel</hi> on the ſubject of treaties: Had he purſued this courſe, it muſt have reſulted in a full conviction, that <hi>the French treaty ſtands completely unimpaired in every point:</hi> he would have learned, that in the conſtruction of treaties, a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent rule prevails from the conſtruction of laws, and that a poſterior treaty does not abrogate a prior one; that Mr. Jay, notwithſtanding this rule (that nothing might be left to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction)
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:028389_0458_0FD8EBBFCAA12160"/>has inſerted an expreſs ſtipulation, that no part of this treaty ſhall, in any wiſe, be conſtrued to affect or impair any former treaty; and that, conſequently, whenever there is a war between France and England, the French treaty will be paramount in every reſpect to the Britiſh treaty, and the French will enjoy in our ports, to the excluſion of the Britiſh, every right and advantage now ſecured to them by their treaty.</p>
                  <p>Such are the ſtrictures on the ſeveral clauſes of the treaty: The reſt of the ſpeech conſiſts of miſcellaneous remarks which ſhall not be overlooked.</p>
                  <p>The firſt which occurs, is a very juſt obſervation, and we have to regret that it is ſo ſoon after flatly contradicted. It is this, "that <hi>equality</hi> muſt be the baſis of every laſting treaty, for without equality, few treaties can laſt." The contradiction which follows it is this; "all <hi>the policy of a nation</hi> ſhould conſiſt in a reſolution never to think of forming treaties of commerce, until it finds itſelf in ſome happy circumſtances which may au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize it to <hi>demand prerogatives</hi> of foreign powers, without purchaſing them even <hi>with equivalents.</hi>" Which of theſe poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions does the ſpeaker mean to inculcate? are we, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of his ſpeech, to follow the rule which applies to the conſtruction of laws or treaties? if we obſerve the one, then the latter poſition abrogates the former; if we obſerve the other, then the firſt poſition ſtands unimpaired: in this dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, perhaps the beſt clue to his intentions is the deſire he has ſhown of exhibiting the laſt poſition in the moſt ſtriking light, and that the ſentiment <hi>in capitals,</hi> is the capital ſentiment he wiſhes to enforce. In this idea we may be confirmed by the general tenor of his obſervations, which inculcate <hi>inequality</hi> in treaties as their only baſis.—If the ſpeaker thinks no treaty can be <hi>laſting</hi> without equality, what muſt we think of his wiſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, which recommends treaties without equality? If <hi>all</hi> nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ought to purſue thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> wiſe policy—if both parties are to demand prerogatives, and not purchaſe them with equivalents —it requires conſiderable ingenuity to diſcover, how treaties can ever be made: this is a new kind of reciprocity, with the benefits all on one ſide.</p>
                  <p>Theſe remarks, which the ingenuity of the ſpeaker alone can reconcile, are followed by two indecent inſinuations, one againſt Mr. Jay, the other againſt the preſident. The firſt is, "that there muſt be ſome <hi>other reaſons</hi> for theſe <hi>uncommon</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renders, upon which the public are not yet ſufficiently inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed." —This inſinuation, coupled with the alluſion to Mr. Jay's having been expoſed to the <hi>temptations</hi> of the Britiſh court, and another alluſion at the cloſe of the ſpeech, though couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:028389_0459_0FD8EBC149A16888"/>in more ambiguous and decorous language, than was either ſpoken at St. Michael's, or retailed afterwards in the public prints, leaves no room to doubt a wiſh to fix, in the public mind, a marked imputation on the <hi>moral character</hi> of <hi>Mr. Jay.</hi> If Mr. Jay has, from corrupt motives, ſacrificed his country's intereſts, I moſt ſincerely pray to God he may be detected and puniſhed; but his ſigning the treaty is not in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a ſufficient cauſe of ſuſpicion or inſinuation: As well may we ſuſpect the twenty ſenators, among whom are men as pure and virtuous as ever breathed. He muſt either have been very unfortunate in his intercourſe with the world, or poſſeſs a mind <hi>very ſuſceptible of ſuch impreſſions,</hi> as well as a heart very liable to be ſhaken, who can think it probable, that two thirds of the ſenate, as well as Mr. Jay, have been guilty of ſuch infamy. The idea is too groſs and too invidious to be entertained. Should it, however, be found to be the caſe, the treaty, like other fraudulent contracts, would be null and void by the law of nations. In this charge, it has not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, been even ſhown, what theſe uncommon ſurrenders are, and wherein they differ from the ſtipulations in our former treaties.</p>
                  <p>The inſinuation againſt the <hi>preſident</hi> is, "<hi>his poſtponing the conſideration of the treaty from January to June.</hi>" The treaty, it is well known, did not reach Philadelphia until <hi>the</hi> 7th <hi>of March:</hi> the preſident never ſaw it before that day; and the ſenate had adjourned on the third. Thoſe members, who had to return home to the extremities of the union, could not, with convenience, re-aſſemble before the month of June, the ſecond Monday in which had been fixed for their meeting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they adjourned.</p>
                  <p>No one will deny, that "any treaty which may operate to leſſen our ſhipping, and deſtroy that competition which is ſo neceſſary for our obtaining a proper price for our ſtaples, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a matter of ſerious concern." But has it been proved, that the commercial articles of this treaty, as ratified by the ſenate, will produce this effect? Is there any thing in them, which diminiſhes, in the ſmalleſt degree, the efficacy of thoſe regulations, which have given ſuch a ſpring to our commerce? Not a ſyllable. Is it deſired to lay further reſtrictions on fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign commerce? <hi>That</hi> would indeed be a matter of ſerious concern: would any thing tend more to deſtroy that competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is ſo neceſſary to our obtaining ready freights and a quick demand for our ſtaples, than to exclude, by heavy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions, the ſhipping of other nations, or to give a mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poly to particular nations? There is one thing, and one only, which would be ſtill worſe, and that is, WAR, which ſeems
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:028389_0460_0FD8EBC493FC2278"/>to be now a favorite meaſure with many, who would perhaps be among the firſt to be tired of it.</p>
                  <p>The remainder of the ſpeech conſiſts of ſundry objections ſimilar to thoſe ſlated in the committee's report, and of general principles, applicable to commercial nations, on which no comments are neceſſary. From a review of the whole of it, it will be found to contain the moſt extraordinary collection of errors, ſelf-contradictions, and unfounded accuſations, that ever was heard of in the annals of political declamation. The author may, indeed, be ſaid to have ſurpaſſed all his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors; for it may be ſafely aſſerted, that hiſtory can produce no inſtance, where ſuch a maſs of aſtoniſhing and glaring contradictions and inconſiſtencies has been condenſed into the compaſs of half a newſpaper: To the merit of a moſt ſurpriſing ingenuity, in this reſpect, he is fairly entitled, if to no other.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps, it will be thought that the writer of theſe ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is a friend of Mr. Jay's. He poſitively denies it; he has a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſlight perſonal acquaintance with Mr. Jay, and has had ſome perſonal reaſons to diſlike him. That gentleman's manners are not ſuch as to gain him friends; experience, on the contrary, has evinced, that he has many <hi>bitter perſonal</hi> enemies. But thoſe, who remember his long and faithful ſervices, who know his tried attachment to his country, and the integrity of his heart, ought not, without proof, to abandon him to public in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy. He has been attacked with a virulence, which public motives alone ſeem not to have required; he has been attacked <hi>in his abſence;</hi> were he here to defend himſelf, or had the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack not affected his moral character, the writer of this would have been ſilent. But when baſe and corrupt motives are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly and publicly charged on a old public ſervant—on a man who has near twenty years held high and important ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions under our government—on the preſent chief magiſtrate of a ſiſter ſtate—when, through his ſide, the purity and honor of our government and country are deeply wounded—when the preſident himſelf is charged with a double <hi>violation of the conſtitution,</hi> and with ignorance, or ſomething worſe, in the appointment of Mr. Jay—when attempts are made to ſow the ſeeds of oppoſition to the government and laws, by miſinform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people, and exciting, by ſuch miſinformation, an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of their conſtituted authorities—when, through the whole of this, a tiſſue of errors and contradictions is diſcerni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to be ſilent would be to acquieſce in the miſchievous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of ſuch proceedings, would be to co-operate in promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the confuſion and anarchy which are their inevitable reſult.</p>

                  <p>GREAT events have rouſed the people of America from that lethargy in which they ingloriouſly repoſed, and have excited an attention, mingled with anxiety, peculiarly favorable to political diſcuſſions. Whilſt that lethargy exiſted, the American revolution appeared incomplete to the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, who only contemplates the effects of political innovations upon the human character. The Americans retained many of the prominent features of the Engliſh temper. They were not, like the Engliſh, ambitious, perfidious, rapacious, and vindictive; but, like the Engliſh, they arrogantly deemed their conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on perfect, and their government immaculate—Like the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, they acquired a faith in adminiſtration, approaching to bigotry, an attachment to perſons, approaching to idolatry. Whilſt a veſtige of this character remained, enlightened patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otiſm could only ſpeak in "afflicted tones." But the French revolution has diffuſed a blaze of light over the American world. It has communicated a fervor, an energy, a ſublimity of character. It has deſtroyed that timidity which could not gaze upon the divine aſpect of liberty, which appointed a high prieſt to that "immortal daughter of reaſon," and which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered homage to her, only through the medium of flattery to him.</p>
                  <p>It is to my country, thus completely regenerated, candid, moderate, impartial, and democratical, that I addreſs, with confidence and ſincerity, ſome inveſtigations into the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and ſome obſervations on the conduct, of our federal government—I am not one of thoſe cold beings, who can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal their opinions and ſtifle their feelings.—When I examine ſome meaſures, and when I denounce ſome men, I may be tranſported with an ardour, which moderation may deem vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, which calumny may call factiouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>A party, animated by the moſt dangerous principles, have long deluded this country, by extolling the excellencies of the federal government, by proclaiming dangerous conſpiracies againſt its exiſtence, and by ſtigmatizing their own enemies, as the foes of tranquillity, of union, and virtue—This party, active in the convention of 1787, and clamorous in all the ſtate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, have allured to their ſtandard many of the <hi>ci-devant</hi> he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes and patriots of America; have uſurped the name of Fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts; have denounced their enemies; have ſeized the moſt
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:028389_0462_0FD8EBCA65B94D88"/>important offices of ſtate; and eſtabliſhed an influence inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of the people—They boldly denominated the generous patriots, who oppoſed the adoption of this government, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their "under ſtandings were enlightened by prophecy," anarchiſts, impelled by atrocious paſſions to involve their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in miſery—An enemy to the federal conſtitution, according to their logic, is an enemy to liberty—and an enemy to the ſyſtem of adminiſtration, or to the moſt contemptible ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of one of the departments, is an enemy to the federal conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>But the period has arrived, when the artifices of this party can no longer impoſe, when the machinations of this party can no longer enthral the minds of the people—They will diſdain to be marſhalled againſt each other in hoſtile array, to march under the banner of abſurd and artificial diſtinctions, and to be inflamed to hoſtilities by the cant terms of men, who deſpiſe their principles and attack their rights—The pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating politician perceives the downfal of American ariſtocracy, in the ratification of a treaty which has been deprecated by rour millions of men, and impoſed upon them by twenty and ONE— The people feel oppre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>IT is provided by the tenth article of the treaty, that "nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The virulence with which this article has been attacked, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail to excite very painful ſenſations in every mind duly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with the ſanctity of public faith, and with the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of national credit and character; at the ſame time that it furniſhes the moſt cogent reaſons to deſire, that the preſervation of peace may obviate the pretext and the tempration to fully the honor, and wound the intereſts of the country, by a meaſurs which the truly enlightened of every nation would condemn.</p>
                     <p>I acknowledge, without reſerve, that in proportion to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence of the oppoſition againſt this part of the treaty, is the ſatisfaction I derive from its exiſtence, as an obſtacle the more to the perpetration of a thing, which, in my opimon, beſides deeply injuring our real and permanent intereſt, would cover us with ignominy. No powers of language, at my command, can expreſs the abhorrence I feel at the idea of violating the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of individuals, which, in an authorized intercourſe in time of peace, has been confided to the faith of our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and laws, on account of controverſies between nation and nation. In my view, every moral and every political ſentiment unite to conſign it to execration.</p>
                     <p>Neither will I diffemble, that the dread of the effects of the ſpirit which patronizes that idea, has ever been with me one of the moſt perſuaſive arguments for a pacific policy on the part of the United States. Serious as the evil of war has appeared, at the preſent ſtage of our affairs, the manner in which it was to be apprehended it might be carried on, was ſtill more formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in my eyes, than the thing itſelf. It was to be feared, that in the fermentation of certain wild opinions, thoſe wiſe, juſt,
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:028389_0464_0FD8EBCEC75647D8"/>and temperate maxims, which will for ever conſtitute the true ſecurity and felicity of a ſtate, would be overruled; and that a war upon credit, eventually upon property, and upon the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral principles of public order, might aggravate and embitter the ordinary calamities of foreign war. The confiſcation of debts due to the enemy, might have been the firſt ſtep of this deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive proceſs. From one violation of juſtice to another, the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage is eaſy. Invaſions of right, ſtill more fatal to credit, might have followed; and this, by extinguiſhing the reſources which that could have afforded, might have paved the way to more comprehenſive and more enormous depredations for a ſubſtitute. Terrible examples were before us; and there were too many not ſufficiently remote from a diſpoſition to admire and imitate them.</p>
                     <p>The earneſt and extenſive clamours againſt the part of the treaty under conſideration, confirm that anticipation; and whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It would have been an ineſtimable gem in our national conſtitution, had it contained a poſitive prohibition againſt ſuch a practice, except, perhaps, by way of repriſal for the identical injury on the part of another nation.</p>
                     <p>Analogous to this is that liberal and excellent proviſion, in the Britiſh Magna Charta, which declares, that "if the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of a country at war with England, are found there in the beginning of the war, they ſhall be attached without harm of body or <hi>effects,</hi> until it is known in what manner Engliſh merchants are treated in the enemy's country; and if they are ſafe, that the foreign merchants ſhall alſo be ſafe."<note n="*" place="bottom">Si Mercatores ſint de terra contra nos guerrira, et tales inveniantur in terra noſtra in principio guerr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

XIV.</note> How much it is to be regretted, that our mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na charta is not unequivocally decorated with a like feature; and that, in this inſtance, we, who have given ſo many ſplendid
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:028389_0465_0FD8EBD3C2647510"/>examples to mankind, are excelled in conſtitutional precaution for the maintenance of juſtice!</p>
                     <p>There is, indeed, ground to aſſert, that the contrary principle would be repugnant to that article of our conſtitution, which provides, that "no ſtate ſhall paſs any law impairing the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of contracts." The ſpirit of this clauſe, though the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it be reſtricted to the ſtates individually, muſt, on fair conſtruction, be conſidered as a rule for the United States; and if ſo, could not eaſily be reconciled with the confiſcation or ſequeſtration of private debts in time of war. But it is a pity, that ſo important a principle ſhould have been left to inference and implication, and ſhould not have received an expreſs and direct ſanction.</p>
                     <p>This poſition muſt appear a frightful hereſy in the eyes of thoſe who repreſent the confiſcation or ſequeſtration of debts, as our beſt means of retaliation, and coercion, as our moſt powerful, ſometimes as our only means of defence.</p>

                     <p>Such a man will never endure the baſe doctrine, that our ſecurity is to depend on the tricks of a ſwindler. He will look for it in the courage and conſtancy of a free, brave and virtuous people—in the riches of a fertile ſoil—an extended and progreſſive induſtry—in the wiſdom and energy of a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtituted and well-adminiſtered government—in the reſources of a ſolid, if well ſupported, national credit—in the armies, which, if requiſite, could be raiſed—in the means of maritime
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:028389_0466_0FD8EBD4CB3EE418"/>annoyance, which, if neceſſary, could be organized, and with which we could inflict deep wounds on the commerce of a hoſtile nation. He will indulge an animating conſciouſneſs, that, while our ſituation is not ſuch as to juſtify our courting impradent enterpriſes, neither is it ſuch as to oblige us, in any event, to ſtoop to diſhonorable means of ſecurity, or to ſubſtitute a crooked and piratical policy, for the manly energies of fair and open war.</p>
                     <p>That is the conſequence of the favorite doctrine, that the confiſeation or ſequeſtration of private debts is our moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, if not our only, weapon of defence! Great Britain is the ſole power againſt whom we could wield it, ſince it is to her citizens alone, that we are largely indebted. What are we to do, then, againſt any other nation which might think ſit to menace us? Are we, for want of adequate means of deſence, to crouch beneath the uplifted rod, and, with abject deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, ſue for mercy? Or has providence guaranteed us ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially againſt the malice or ambition of every power on earth, except Great Britain?</p>
                     <p>It is at once curious and inſtructive to mark the inconſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the diſorganizing ſect. Is the queſtion, to diſcard a ſpirit of accommodation, and ruſh into war with Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain? Columus are filled with the moſt abſurd exaggerations, to prove that we are able to meet her, not only on equal, but ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior terms.—Is the queſtion, whether a ſtipulation againſt the confiſcation or ſequeſtration of private debts ought to have been admitted into the treaty? Then are we a people deſtitute of the means of war, with neither arms, nor fleets, nor ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines— then is our beſt, if not our only weapons of defence, the power of confiſcating or ſequeſtrating the debts which are due to the ſubjects of Great Britain; in other words, the power of committing fraud, of violating the public faith, of ſacrificing the principles of commerce, of proſtrating credit. Is the queſtion, whether free ſhips ſhall make free goods, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther naval ſtores ſhall or ſhall not be deemed contraband? Then is the appeal to what is called the <hi>modern</hi> law of nations; then is the cry, that recent uſage has changed and mitigated the rigour of ancient maxims. But is the queſtion, whether private debts can be rightfully confiſcated or ſequeſtered? Then ought the utmoſt rigour of the ancient doctrine to govern, and modern uſage and opinion to be diſcarded. The old rule or the new is to be adopted or rejected, juſt as may ſuit their convenience.</p>
                     <p>An inconſiſtency of another kind, but not leſs curious, is obſervable in poſitions, repeatedly heard from the ſame quarter,
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:028389_0467_0FD8EBD65150B958"/>namely, that the ſequeſtration of debts is the only peaceable mean of doing ourſelves juſtice and avoiding war. If we trace the origin of the pretended right to confiſcate or ſequeſter debts, we find it, in the very authority, principally relied on to prove it, to be this (Bynkerſhoeck, quaeſtiones juris publici. 1. ſ. 2.) "ſince it is the <hi>condition</hi> of WAR, that ENEMIES may be deprived of all their rights, it is reaſonable, that every thing of an enemy's, found among his enemies, ſhould change its owner, and go to the treaſury." Hence it is manifeſt, that the right itſelf, if it exiſt, pre-ſuppoſes, as the <hi>condition</hi> of its exerciſe, an <hi>actual ſtate of war,</hi> the <hi>relation of enemy to enemy.</hi> Yet we are faſtidiouſly and hypocritically told, that this high and explicit act of war, is a peaceable mean of doing ourſelves juſtice and avoiding war. Why ae we thus told? Why is this ſtrange paradox attempted to be impoſed upon us! Why, but that it is the policy of the conſpirators againſt our peace, to endeavour to diſguiſe the hoſtilities, into which they wiſh to plunge us, with a ſpecious outſide, and to precipitate us down the precipice of war, while we imagine we are quietly and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely walking along its ſummit.</p>
                     <p>Away with theſe abſurd and incongruous ſophiſms! Bluſh, ye apoſtles of temerity, of meanneſs, and of deception! Ceaſe to beckon us to war, and at the ſame time to freeze our cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age by the cowardly declaration, that we have no reſource but in fraud! Ceaſe to attempt to perſuade us, that peace may be obtained by means which are unequivocal acts of war. Ceaſe to tell us, that war is preferable to diſhonor, and yet, as our firſt ſtep, to urge us into irretrievable diſhonor. A magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, a ſenſibre people, cannot liſten to your crude concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons —Why will ye perſevere in accumulating ridicule and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon your own heads?</p>
                     <p>In the further obſervations, which I ſhall offer on this arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, I hope to ſatisfy, not the determined leaders or inſtruments of faction, but all diſcerning men, all good citizens, that, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being a blemiſh, it is an ornament to the inſtrument in which it is contained; that it is as conſiſtent with true poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy as with ſubſtantial juſtice; that it is, in ſubſtance, not without precedent in our other treaties; and that the objections to it are futile.</p>

                        </list>
Theſe, if analiſed, reſolve themſelves, in principle, into two diſcriminations, viz. private debts, and private property in public funds. The character of private property prevails throughout. No property of either govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is protected from confiſcation or ſequeſtration by the other. This laſt circumſtance merits attention, becauſe it marks the true boundary.</p>
                     <p>The propriety of the ſtipulation will be examined under theſe ſeveral aſpects: the right to confiſcate or ſequeſtrate private debts or private property in public funds, on the ground of reaſon and principle—the right as depending on the opinions of juriſts and on uſage—the policy and expediency of the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice —the analogy of the ſtipulation with ſtipulations in our other treaties, and in treaties between other nations.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, as to the right on the ground of reaſon and principle.</p>
                     <p>The general propoſition on which it is ſupported, is this, "That every individual of a nation, with whom we are at war, whereſoever he may be, is our enemy, and his property of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kind, in every place, liable to capture by right of war."</p>
                     <p>The only exception admitted to this rule, reſpects property within the juriſdiction of a neutral ſtate; but the exemption is referred to the right of the neutral nation, not to any privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege which the ſituation gives to the enemy proprietor.</p>
                     <p>Reaſon, if conſulted, will ſuggeſt another exception—This regards all ſuch property as the laws of a country permit foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to acquire within it or to bring into it. The right of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or having property in a country, always implies a duty on the part of its government to protect that property, and ſecure to the owner the full enjoyment of it. Whenever, therefore, a government grants permiſſion to foreigners to acquire proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty within its territories, or to bring and depoſit it there, it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly promiſes protection and ſecurity. It muſt be underſtood to engage, that the foreign proprietor, as to what he ſhall have acquired or depoſited, ſhall enjoy the rights, privileges and immunities of a native proprietor, without any other excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons than thoſe which the eſtabliſhed laws may have previouſly declared. How can any thing elſe be underſtood? Every ſtate, when it has entered into no contrary engagement, is free to permit or not to permit foreigners to acquire or bring property
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:028389_0469_0FD8EBDE9ADBA410"/>within its juriſdiction; but if it grant the right, what is there to make the tenu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e of the foreigner different from that of the native, if antecedent laws have not pronounced a difference? Property, as it exits in civilized ſociety, if not a creature of, is, at leaſt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> and defined by, the laws. They preſcribe the manner in which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> be uſed, alienated, or tranſmitted; the conditions on which it may be help, preſerved, or forfeited. It is to them we are to look for its rights, limitations, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. No condition of enjoyment, no cauſe of forfeiture, which they have not ſpecified, can be preſumed to exiſt. An extraordinary diſcretion to reſume or take away the thing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any perſonal fault of the proprietor, is inconſiſtent with the notion of property. This ſeems always to imply a contract between the ſociety and the individual; that he ſhall retain and be protected in the poſſeſſion and uſe of his property, ſo long as he ſhall obſerve and perform the conditions which the laws have annexed to the tenure. It is neither natural nor equitable to conſider him as ſubject to be deprived of it, for a cauſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign to himſelf: ſtill leſs for one which may depend on the volition or pleaſure, even of the very government to whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection it has been confided: for the propoſition, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the right to confiſcate or ſequeſter, does not diſtinguiſh between offenſive or defenſive war; between a war of ambition on the part of the power which exerciſes the right, or a war of ſelf-preſervation againſt the aſſaults of another.</p>
                     <p>The property of a foreigner placed in another country, by permiſſion of its laws, may juſtly be regarded as a depoſit, of which the ſociety is the truſtee. How can it be reconciled with the idea of a truſt, to take the property from its owner, when he has perſonally given no cauſe for the deprivation?</p>
                     <p>Suppoſe two families in a ſtate of nature, and that a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of one of them had by permiſſion of the head of the other, placed in his cuſtody ſome article belonging to himſelf—and ſuppoſe a quarrel to enſue between the two heads of families, in which the member had not participated by his immediate counſel or conſent—would not natural equity declare the ſeizure and confiſcation of the depoſited property to be an act of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious rapacity?</p>
                     <p>Again—ſuppoſe two neighbouring nations, which had not had intercourſe with each other, and one of them opens its ports and territories for the purpoſe of commerce, to the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of the other, proclaiming free and ſafe ingreſs and egreſs —ſuppoſe afterwards a war to break out between the two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the one which had granted that permiſſion, to ſeize and convert to its own uſe, the goods and credits of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:028389_0470_0FD8EBE013AEDD38"/>of the other, within its dominion. What ſentence would natural reaſon, unwarped by particular dogmas, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce on ſuch conduct? If we abſtract ourſelves from extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous impreſſions, and conſult a moral feeling, we ſhall not doubt that the ſentence would inflict all the opprobium and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy of violated faith.</p>
                     <p>Nor can we diſtinguſh either caſe, in principle, from that which conſtantly takes place between nations, that permit a commercial intercourſe with each other, whether with or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out national compact. They equally grant a right to bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to and carry out of their territories the property which is the ſubject of the intercourſe, a right of free and ſecure ingreſs and egreſs; and in doing this, they make their territories a ſanctuary or aſylum, which ought to be inviolable, and which the ſpirit of plunder only could have ever violated.</p>
                     <p>There is no parity between the caſe of the perſons and goods of enemies found in our own country, and that of the perſons and goods of enemies found elſewhere. In the former there is a reliance upon our hoſpitality and juſtice; there is an expreſs or implied ſafe conduct; the individuals and their property are in the cuſtody of our faith: they have no power to reſiſt our will; they can lawfully make no defence againſt our vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; they are deemed to owe a temporary allegiance; and for endeavouring reſiſtance, would be puniſhed as criminals; a character inconſiſtent with that of an enemy. To make them a prey, is, therefore, to infringe every rule of generoſity and equity; it is to add cowardice to treachery. In the latter caſe, there is no confidence whatever repoſed in us; no claim upon our hoſpitality, juſtice or good faith; there is the ſimple cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of enemy, with entire liberty to oppoſe force to force. The right of war conſequently to attack and ſeize, whether to obtain indemnification for any injury received—to diſable our enemy from doing us further harm—to force him to reaſonable terms of accommodation—or to repreſs an overbearing ambition, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts in full vigour, unreſtrained and unqualified by any truſt or duty on our part. In purſuing it, though we may inflict hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, we do not commit injuſtice.</p>
                     <p>Moreover the property of the foreigner within our country, may be regarded as having paid a valuable conſideration for its protection and exemption from forfeiture; that which is brought in, commonly enriches the revenue by a duty of entry. All that is within our territory, whether acquired there or brought there, is liable to contributions to the treaſury, in common with other ſimilar property. Does there not reſult an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to protect that which comtributes to the expenſe of its
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:028389_0471_0FD8EBE188989F60"/>protection? will juſtice ſanction, upon the breaking out of a war, the confiſcation of a property, which, during peace, ſerves to augment the reſources and nouriſh the proſperity of a ſtate?</p>
                     <p>The principle of the propoſition gives an equal right to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the perſon as the property of the foreigner to the rigors of war. But what would be thought of a government which ſhould ſeize all the ſubjects of its enemy found within its territory, and commit them to durance, as priſoners of war? Would not all agree that it had violated an aſylum which ought to have been ſacred? That it had trampled upon the laws of hoſpitality and civilization? That it had diſgraced itſelf by an act of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and barbariſm?<note n="*" place="bottom">All that can rightfully be done, is to oblige the foreigners, who are ſubjects of our enemy, to quit our country.</note> Why would it not be equally reprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to violate the aſylum which had been given to the property of thoſe foreigners?</p>

                     <p>When it is conſidered, that the promiſe made to the foreigner is not made to him in the capacity of member of another foci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, but in that of citizen of the world, or of an individual in

There is no real affinity between the motive and the conſequence. There is a confounding of relations. The obligation of a contract can only be avoided by the breach of a condition expreſs or implied, which appears or can be preſumed to have been within the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of both parties, or by the perſonal fault or crime of him to whom it is to be performed.

Theſe exceptions involve no refinement—they depend on obvious conſiderations, and are agreeable to common ſenſe and to nature—the ſpontaneous feelings of equity accord with them.

                     <p>To underſtand how far theſe ought to weigh, it is requiſite to conſider what are the elements or ingredients, which compoſe what is called the law of nations.</p>
                     <p>The conſtituent parts of this ſyſtem are,
<list>
                           <item>1. The <hi>neceſſary</hi> or internal law, which is the <hi>law of nature</hi> applied to nations; or that ſyſtem of rules for regulating the conduct of nation to nation, which reaſon deduces from the principles of natural right, as relative to political ſocieties or ſtates.</item>
                           <item>2. The <hi>voluntary</hi> law, which is a ſyſtem of rules reſulting from the equality and independence of nations, and which, in the adminiſtration of their affairs, and the purſuit of their pretenſions, proceeding on the principle of their having no common judge upon earth, attributes equal validity, as to external effects, to the meaſures or conduct of one as of another, without regard to the intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic juſtice of thoſe meaſures or that conduct. Thus captures, in war, are as valid, when made by the party in the wrong, as by the party in the right.</item>
                           <item>3. The <hi>pactitious</hi> or <hi>conventional</hi> law, or that law which reſults from a treaty between two or more nations. This is evidently a particular, not a general law, ſince a treaty or pact can only bind the contracting parties: Yet, when we find a proviſion univerſally pervading the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties between nations, for a length of time, as a kind of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mula, it is high evidence of the general law of nations.</item>
                           <item>4. The cuſtomary law, which conſiſts of thoſe rules of conduct, that, in practice, are reſpected and obſerved among nations: Its authority depends on uſage, implying a tacit conſent and agreement. This alſo is a particular, not a general law, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:028389_0474_0FD8EBEB8CDB59F0"/>only on thoſe nations whoſe acquieſcence has appeared, or, from circumſtances, may fairly be preſumed. Thus, the cuſtomary law of Europe may not be that of a different quarter of the globe. The three laſt branches are ſometimes aggregately denominated the <hi>poſitive</hi> law of nations.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>The two firſt are diſcoverable by reaſon; the two laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on proof, as matters of fact. Hence the opinion of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſts, though weighing, as the ſentiments of judicious or learned men, who have made the ſubject a particular ſtudy, are not concluſive, as authorities.—In regard to the <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>voluntary</hi> law, eſpecially, they may be freely diſregarded, unleſs they are found to be adopted and ſanctioned by the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of nations: For where REASON is the guide, it cannot properly be renounced for mere OPINION, however reſpectable. As witneſſes of the cuſtomary laws, their teſtimony, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of careful reſearches, is more particularly entitled to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
                     <p>If, then, it has been ſatisfactorily proved, as the dictate of ſound reaſon, that private debts, and private property in public funds, are not juſtly liable to confiſcation or ſequeſtration, an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite opinion of one or more juriſts could not controul the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion in point of principle. So far as it may atteſt a practice of nations, which may have introduced a poſitive law on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the conſideration may be different. It will then remain to examine, upon their own and other teſtimony, whether that practice be ſo general as to be capable of varying a rule of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by the force of uſage; and whether it ſtill continues to bear the ſame character, or has been weakened or done away by ſome recent or more modern uſage.</p>
                     <p>I will not avail myſelf of a poſition, advanced by ſome writers, that uſage, if derogating from the principles of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral juſtice, is null, further than to draw this inference, that a rule of right, deducible from them, cannot be deemed to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by uſage, partially contradicted, fluctuating.</p>
                     <p>With theſe guides, our further enquiries will ſerve to confirm us in the negative of the pretended right to confiſcate or ſequeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the caſes ſuppoſed.</p>
                     <p>The notion of this right is evidently derived from the ROMAN law.

<pb n="188" facs="unknown:028389_0475_0FD8EBECC9E9B070"/>who firſt gets poſſeſſion. It is known, that the maxims of the Roman law are extenſively incorporated into the different codes of Europe; and particularly, that the writers on the law of nations have borrowed liberally from them. This ſource of the notion does not ſtamp it with much authority. The hiſtory of Rome proves, that war and conqueſt were the great buſineſs of that people, and that, for the moſt part, commerce was little cultivated. Hence it was natural, that the rights of war ſhould be carried to an extreme, unmitigated by the ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening and humanizing influence of commerce. Indeed the world was yet too young—moral ſcience too much in its cradle —to render the Roman juriſprudence a proper model for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit imitation: accordingly, in this very particular of the rights of war, it ſeems to have been equally a rule of the Roman law, "That thoſe who go into a foreign country, in time of peace, if war is ſuddenly kindled, are made the ſlaves of thoſe among whom, now become enemies by ill fortune, they are apprehended."<note n="†" place="bottom">

                     <p>The improvement of moral ſcience in modern times, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains the right of killing an enemy to the time of battle or reſiſtance, except by way of puniſhment for ſome enormous breach of the law of nations, or for ſelf preſervation, in caſe of immediate and urgent danger; and rejects altogether the right of impoſing ſlavery on captives.</p>
                     <p>Why ſhould there have been a heſitation to reject other odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſequences of ſo exceptionable a principle? What reſpect is due to maxims which have ſo inhuman a foundation?</p>
                     <p>And yet a deference for thoſe maxims has miſled writers who have profeſſedly undertaken to teach the principles of national ethics; and the ſpirit of rapine has continued, to a late period, to conſecrate the relics of ancient barbariſm with too many precedents of imitation—Elſe it would not now be a queſtion with any, "Whether the perſon or property of a foreigner, being in our country with permiſſion of the laws of peace,

                        </gap>ould be liable to moleſtation or injury by the laws of war— merely on account of the war?"</p>
                     <p>Turning from the ancients to the moderns, we find, that the learned Grotius quotes and adopts, as the baſis of his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, the rules of the Roman law; though he, in ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, qualifies them, by the humane innovations of later times.</p>
                     <p>On the very queſtion of the right to confiſcate or ſequeſter pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate debts, his opinion, as far as it appears, ſeems to be at variance with his premiſes, ſteering a kind of middle courſe. His expreſſions (L. III. C. XX. Sec. XVI.) are theſe, "Thoſe debts which are due to private perſons, at the beginning of the war, are not to be accounted forgiven (that is, when peace is made) for theſe are not acquired by the right of war, but only <hi>forbidden to be demanded</hi> in time of war; therefore, the <hi>impediment</hi> being removed, that is, the war ended, they retain their full force." His idea appears from this paſſage to be, that that the right of war is limited to the arreſting of the payment of private debts during its continuance, and not to the confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or annihilation of the debt. Nor is it clear, whether he means, that this arreſtation is to be produced by a ſpecial act of prohibition, or by the operation of ſome rule of law, which denies to an alien enemy a right of action. This feeble and heterogeneous opinion may be conceived to have proceeded from a conflict between a reſpect for ancient maxims, and the impreſſion of more enlightened views, inculcated by the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of commerce and civilization.</p>
                     <p>Bynkerſhoeck is more conſiſtent: Adopting, with Grotius, the rule of the Roman law in its full vigour, he is not fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened at the conſequences, but follows them throughout.

                     <p>In confirmation of his doctrine, he adduces a variety of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, which embrace a period of ſomething more than a century, beginning in the year 1556, and ending in the year 1657, and which comprehends, as actors on the principle which
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:028389_0477_0FD8EB038CEBE838"/>he eſpouſes, France, Spain, the States General, Denmark, the biſhops of Cologne, and Munſter. But he acknowledges that the right has been queſtioned; and notes particularly, that when the king of France and the biſhops of Munſter and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logne, in the year 1563, confiſcated the debts which their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects owed to the confederate Belgians, the ſtates general, by an edict of the 6th of July, of that year, cenſured the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and decreed that thoſe debts could not be paid but to the true creditors, and that the exaction of them, whether by force or with conſent, was not to be eſteemed valid.</p>
                     <p>If from the great pains which appear to have been taken by this learned writer, to collect examples in proof of his doctrine, we are to conclude that the collection is tolerably complete, we are warranted in drawing this inference, that he has not cured any defect, which reaſon may diſcern in his principle, by any thing like the evidence of ſuch a general, uniform, and continued uſage, as is requiſite to introduce <hi>a rule</hi> of the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive law of nations, in derogation from the natural.</p>
                     <p>A minority only of the powers of Europe are ſhown to have been implicated in the practice; and among the majority, not included, are ſeveral of the moſt conſiderable and reſpectable. One of theſe, Great Britain, is repreſented as having acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſced in it, in the treaties of peace, between her and ſome of the powers who went into the practice, to her detriment, by relinquiſhing the claim of reſtitution—But war muſt, at length, end in peace; and the ſacrifice a nation makes to the latter, is a ſlight argument of her conſent to the principle of the injuries which ſhe may have ſuſtained. I have not been able to trace a ſingle inſtance in which Great Britain has, herſelf, ſet the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of ſuch a practice; nor could ſhe do it, as has elſewhere appeared, without contravening an article of magna charta, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by way of repriſal for the ſame thing done towards her. The ſuggeſtion of an inſtance in the preſent war with France, will, hereafter, be examined. In ſuch a queſtion, the practice of a nation, which has, for ages, figured pre-eminently in the commercial world, is entitled to particular notice.</p>
                     <p>It is not unworthy of remark, that the common law of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, from its earlieſt dawnings, contradicted the rule of the Roman law. It exempted from ſeizure, by a ſubject of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, the property of a foreigner brought there before a war; but gave to the firſt ſeizer, or occupant, the property which came there after the breaking out of a war. The noble prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the common law cannot ceaſe to engage our reſpect, while we have before our eyes ſo many monuments of their excellence in our own juriſdiction.</p>

It alſo merits to be dwelt upon, that the United Netherlands, for ſome time the firſt, and long only the ſecond in commerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al conſequence, formally diſputed the right, and condemned the practice of confiſcating private debts, though themſelves, in ſome inſtances, guilty of it.</p>

This negative uſage, of a period, the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened as well as the moſt commercial in the annals of the world, is of the higheſt authority. The former uſage, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing partial and with numerous exceptions, was inſufficient to eſtabliſh a rule.—The contrary uſage, or the renunciation of the former uſage, as being general, as attended with few or no exceptions, is ſufficient even to work a change in the rigour of an ancient rule, if it could be ſuppoſed to have been eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Much more is it ſufficient to confirm and enforce the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of reaſon, and to diſſipate the clouds which error, and ſome ſcattered inſtances of violence and rapine, may have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
                     <p>Of the theoretical writers, whom I had an opportunity of conſulting, Vattel is the only remaining one, who directly treats the point. His opinion has been ſaid to favor the right to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcate and ſequeſter. But when carefully analized, it will add to the proofs of the levity with which the oppoſers of the treaty make aſſertions.</p>
                     <p>After ſtating, among other things, that "war gives the ſame right over any ſum of money due by a neutral nation to our enemy, as it can give over his other goods," he proceeds thus —"When Alexander, by conqueſt, became abſolute maſter of Thebes, he remitted to the Theſſalians, a hundred talents, which they owed to the Thebans. The ſovereign has naturally the ſame right over what his ſubjects may be indebted to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; therefore he may confiſcate debts of this nature, if the term of payment happen in the time of war; or, at leaſt, he may prohibit his ſubjects from paying, while the war laſts. But at preſent, in regard to the advantage and ſafety of commerce, all the ſovereigns of Europe have departed from this rigour.
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:028389_0479_0FD8EBFBD34EFE40"/>And as this cuſtom has been generally received, he who ſhould act contrary to it, would injure the public faith; for ſtrangers truſted his ſubjects only from a firm perſuaſion, that the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cuſtom would be obſerved. The ſtate does not ſo much as touch the ſums which it owes to the enemy. Every where, in caſe of a war, funds credited to the public, are exempt from confiſcation and ſeizure."<note n="*" place="bottom">Book III. Chap. 5. ſect. 77.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt propoſition of the above paſſage, amounts to this, that "a ſovereign <hi>naturally,</hi> that is, according to the law of nature, may confiſcate debts, which his ſubjects owe to his enemies, if the term of payment happen in the time of war; or, at leaſt, he may prohibit his ſubjects from paying while the war laſts."</p>
                     <p>So far as this goes, it agrees with the principle which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, that there is a natural right to confiſcate or ſequeſter pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate debts in time of war; ſo far Vattel accords with the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man law and with Bynkerſhoek.</p>
                     <p>But he annexes a whimſical limitation, "If the term of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment happen in the time of war"—and there is a marked un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty and heſitation—the ſovereign "may confiſcate, or, at leaſt, he may prohibit his ſubjects from paying while the war laſts." It is evident, that the circumſtance of the time of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can have no influence upon the right. If it reaches to confiſcation, which takes away the ſubſtance of the thing, the mere incident of the happening of payment muſt be immaterial. If it is confined to the arreſting of payment during the war, the reaſon of the rule, the object being to prevent ſupplies going to the enemy, will apply it as well to debts which had become payable before the war, as to thoſe which became pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the war. Whence this inaccuracy in ſo accurate a thinker? Whence the heſitation about ſo important a point, as whether the pretended right extends to confiſcation or ſimply to ſequeſtration? They muſt be accounted for, as in another caſe, by the conflict between reſpect for ancient maxims and the impreſſions of juſter views, ſeconded by the more enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened policy of modern times.</p>
                     <p>But while Vattel thus countenances, in the firſt part of the paſſage, the opinion, that the natural law of nations authorizes the confiſcation or ſequeſtration of private debts, in what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately follows, he moſt explicitly and unequivocally informs us, that the rule of that law in this reſpect has been abrogated by modern uſage or cuſtom; in other words, that the modern cuſtomary law has changed in this particular the ancient natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:028389_0480_0FD8EBFCDA30BA28"/>law. Let his own words be conſulted—"At preſent," ſays the, "in regard to the advantage and ſafety of commerce, all the ſovereigns of Europe have departed from this rigour: and as this cuſtom has been generally received, he who would act contrary to it, would injure the public faith; for ſtrangers truſted his ſubjects only from the firm perſuaſion that the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cuſtom would be obſerved."</p>
                     <p>This teſtimony is full, that there is a general cuſtom received and adopted by all the ſovereigns of Europe, which obviates the rigour of the ancient rule; the non-obſervance of which cuſtom would violate the public faith of a nation; as being a breach of an implied contract, by virtue of the cuſtom, upon the ſtrength of which foreigners truſt his ſubjects.</p>
                     <p>Language cannot deſcribe more clearly a rule of the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary law of nations, the eſſence of which, we have ſeen, is general uſage implying a tacit agreement to conform to the rule —The one alleged is denominated a cuſtom generally received, a general cuſtom; all the ſovereigns of Europe are ſtated to be parties to it, and it is repreſented as obligatory on the public faith, ſince this would be injured by a departure from it.</p>
                     <p>The conſequence is, that if the right pretended did exiſt by the natural law, it has given way to the cuſtomary law; for it is a contradiction, to call that a right, which cannot be exerciſed without breach of faith. The reſult is, that by the preſent cuſtomary law of nations, within the ſphere of its action, there is no right to confiſcate or ſequeſter private debts in time of war. The reaſon or motive of which law is the advantage and ſafety of commerce.</p>
                     <p>As to private property in public funds, the right to meddle with them is ſtill more emphatically negatived.—"The ſtate does not <hi>ſo much as touch</hi> the ſums it owes to the enemy—<hi>Every where,</hi> in caſe of a war, funds credited to the public are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from confiſcation and ſeizure." Theſe terms manifeſtly exclude ſequeſtration as well as confiſcation.</p>
                     <p>In another place, the author gives the reaſon of this poſition, Book II. Chap. XVIII. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>n repriſals, the goods of a ſubject are ſeized in the ſame manner as thoſe of the ſtate or the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign. —Every thing that belongs to the nation is liable to repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals as ſoon as it can be ſeized, <hi>provided it be not a depoſite truſted to the public faith.</hi> This DEPOSITE is found in our hands, only in conſequence of that <hi>confidence,</hi> which the proprietor has put in our good faith, and it ought to be reſpected, even in caſe of open war.—Thus it is uſual to behave in France, England, and elſewhere, with reſpect to the money which foreigners have placed in the public funds." The ſame principle, if he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:028389_0481_0FD8EBFE0701DA90"/>without bias, would have taught him, that repriſals could rightfully extend to nothing that had been committed with their permiſſion, to the cuſtody and guardianſhip of our laws, during a ſtate of peace; and conſequently, that no property of our enemy, which was in our country before the breaking out of the war, is juſtly liable to them. For is not all ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty <hi>equally a depoſite, truſted to the public faith?</hi> What foreigner would acquire property in our country, or bring and lodge it there, but in the <hi>confidence,</hi> that, in caſe of war, it would not become an object of repriſals? Why then reſort to cuſtom for a denial of the right to confiſcate or ſequeſter private debts? Why not trace it to the natural injuſtice and perfidy of taking away in war, what a foreigner is permitted to own and have among us in peace? Why ever have conſidered that as a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural right which was contrary to good faith tacitly pledged? This is evidently the effect of too much deference to ferocious maxims of antiquity, of undue complaiſance to ſome precedents of modern rapacity.</p>
                     <p>He had avoided the error, by weighing maturely the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of his own principle in another caſe: "He who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares war, (ſays he) does not confiſcate the <hi>immoveable</hi> goods poſſeſſed in his country by his enemy's ſubjects: <hi>in per mitting them to purchaſe and poſſeſs thoſe goods,</hi> he has, in this reſpect, admitted them into the number of his ſubjects," (that is) he has admitted them to a like privilege with his ſubjects, as to the real property they were permitted to acquire and hold. But, why ſhould a leſs privilege attend the licenſe to purchaſe, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs, or have other kinds of property in his country? The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which is, the permiſſion of the ſovereign, muſt extend to the protection of one kind of property as well as another, if the permiſſion extends to both.</p>
                     <p>Vattel advances in this and in the paſſage quoted immediately before it, the true principles which ought to govern the queſtion —though he does not purſue them into their conſequences; elſe he would not have deduced the exemption of private debts, from confiſcation or ſequeſtration, from the cuſtomary law of nations, but would have traced it to the natural or neceſſary law, as founded upon the obligations of good faith; upon the tacit promiſe of ſecurity connected with the permiſſion to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire property within, or bring property into, our country; upon the protection which every government owes to a property of which it legalizes the acquiſition, or the depoſit within its juriſdiction; and in caſe of <hi>immoveable</hi> goods or real eſtate, of which he admits a right to ſequeſter the <hi>income,</hi> to prevent its being remitted to the enemy, he would have perceived the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaty
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:028389_0482_0FD8EBFFE0A5BA20"/>of leaving this effect to be produced by the obſtructions intrinſically incident to a ſtate of war; ſince there is no reaſon why the income ſhould be leſs privileged than the ſubſtance of the thing.</p>
                     <p>It appears, then, that the doctrine of Vattel, collectively taken, amounts to this, that there is a natural right of war in certain caſes to confiſcate or ſequeſter enemy's property found within our country; but that, on motives relative to commerce and public credit, the cuſtomary law of Europe has reſtrained that right, as to <hi>private debts,</hi> and <hi>private property,</hi> in public funds. His opinion, therefore, favors the principle of the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the treaty under examination, as conſonant with the preſent European law of nations—and it is an opinion of greater weight than any that can be cited; as well on account of the capacity, diligence, information, and the preciſion of ideas, which characteriſe the work in which it is contained, as on account of the recency of that work.<note n="*" place="bottom">It appears to have been written about the year <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>A queſtion may be raiſed—Does this cuſtomary law of nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as eſtabliſhed in Europe, bind the United States? An affirmative anſwer to this is warranted by concluſive reaſons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The United States, when a member of the Britiſh em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, were, in this capacity, a party to that law, and not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſſented from it, when they became independent, they are to be conſidered as having continued a party to it. 2. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law of England, which was and is in force in each of theſe ſtates, adopts the law of nations, the poſitive equally with the natural, as a part of itſelf. 3. Ever ſince we have been an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent nation, we have appealed to, and acted upon, the <hi>modern</hi> law of nations as underſtood in Europe—various reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of congreſs during our revolution—the correſpondencies of executive officers—the deciſions of our courts of admiralty, all recognized this ſtandard. 4. Executive and legiſlative acts, and the proceedings of our courts, under the preſent govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſpeak a ſimilar language. The preſident's proclamation of neutrality, refers expreſsly to the <hi>modern</hi> law of nations, which muſt neceſſarily be underſtood of that prevailing in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, and acceded to by this country; and the general voice of our nation, together with the very arguments uſed againſt the treaty, accord in the ſame point. It is indubitable, that the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomary law of European nations is, as a part of the common law, and by adoption, that of the United States.</p>
                     <p>But let it not be forgotten, that I derive the vindication of the article from a higher ſource, from the natural or neceſſary law

It is a report to the Britiſh king in the year 1753, from Sir George Lee, judge of the prerogative court, Dr. Paul, advocate gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral in the courts of civil law, Sir Dudley Rider and Mr. Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray, attorney and ſolicitor general,<note n="*" place="bottom">Sir George Lee, was afterwards the very celebrated Chief Juſtice Lee, and Mr. Murray was the late Lord Mansfield.</note> on the ſubject of the Sileſia loan, ſequeſtered by the king of Pruſſia, by way of repriſal, for the capture and condemnation of ſome Pruſſian veſſels. This report merits all the reſpect which can be derived from conſummate knowledge and ability in the reporters; but it would loſe much of its weight from the want of impartiality, which might fairly be imputed to the officers of one of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments intereſted in the conteſt, had it not ſince received the confirming eulogies of impartial and celebrated foreign writers.—A mong theſe, Vattel calls it an excellent piece on the law of nations.</p>
                     <p>The following is an extract:—"The king of Pruſſia has pledged his royal word to pay the Sileſia debt to <hi>private men.</hi> It is negociable, and many parts of it have been aſſigned to the ſubjects of other powers. It will not be eaſy to <hi>find an inſtance,</hi> where a prince has though fit to make repriſals upon <hi>a debt due from himſelf to private men.</hi> There is a <hi>confidence that this will not be done.</hi> A private man lends money to a prince upon an <hi>engagement of honor; becauſe a prince cannot be compelled, like other men, in an adverſary way, by a court of juſtice.</hi> So ſcrupulouſly did England and France adhere to this <hi>public faith,</hi> that even during the war, they ſuffered no enquiry to be made whether any part of the public debt was due to the ſubjects of the enemy, though it is certain many Engliſh had money in the French funds, and many French had money in ours."</p>
                     <p>The univerſal obligation of good faith is here reinforced on a ſpecial ground, by the <hi>point of honor;</hi> to confirm the poſition that money which a ſovereign or ſtate owes to private men, is not a proper object of repriſals.</p>
                     <p>This caſe of the Sileſia debt is the only example, within the preſent century, prior to the exiſting war, which I have been able to trace, violating the immunity of private debts, or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate property, in public funds. It is a precedent that can have little weight, not only from ſingularity, but from the character of its author. Frederick was a conſummate general, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:028389_0484_0FD8EC0675FF5958"/>ſtateſman; but he was very far from being a ſevere mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſt. This is not the only inſtance in which he tarniſhed his ſaith; and the friends of his ſame muſt regret, that he could not plead on the occaſion thoſe mighty and dazzling reaſons of ſtate, which are the ſpecious apologies for his other aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
                     <p>It is aſſerted, that the preſent war of Europe affords exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the practice, which I reprobate, and that Great Britain herſelf has given one. The preſent war of Europe is of ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary a complexion, and has been conducted, in all reſpects, upon ſuch extraordinary principles, that it may truly be regarded as an exception to all general rules, as a precedent for nothing. It is rather a beacon, warning mankind to ſhun the pernicious examples, which it ſets, than a model inviting to imitation. The human paſſions, on all ſides, appear to have been wrought up to a pitch of frenzy, which has ſet reaſon, juſtice, and humanity, at defiance.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who have nevertheleſs thought fit to appeal to the examples of this very anomalous war, have not detailed to us the preciſe nature or courſe of the tranſactions to which they refer; nor do I know that ſufficient documents have appeared in this country to guide us in the enquiry.</p>
                     <p>The imperfect evidence which has fallen under my obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reſpects France and Great Britain, and ſeems to exhibit theſe facts.:—</p>
                     <p>France paſſed a decree ſequeſtering the property of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the powers at war with her; and in the ſame or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther decree, obliged all thoſe of her citizens, who had monies owing to them in foreign countries, to draw bills upon their debtors, and to furniſh thoſe bills to the government, by way of loan, or upon certain terms of payment.</p>
                     <p>The government of Great Britain, in conſequence of this proceeding, paſſed ten different acts, the objects of which were to prevent the payment of thoſe bills, and to ſecure the ſums due for the benefit of the original creditors. Theſe acts appoint certain commiſſioners, to whom reports are to be made of all French property in the hands of Britiſh ſubjects, and who are empowered to receive and fell goods and other effects—to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect debts, and to depoſite the proceeds in the bank of London, or in other ſafe keeping, if preferred or required by parties intereſted. The monies depoſited are to be inveſted in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of public ſtock, together with the intereſt or dividends ariſing from time to time, to be eventually accounted for to the proprietors. The commiſſioners have, likewiſe, a diſcretion, upon demand, to deliver over their effects and monies to ſuch
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:028389_0485_0FD8EC0A079F56F8"/>of the proprietors as do not reſide within the French domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall not enter into a diſcuſſion of the propriety of theſe acts of Great Britain.—It is ſufficient to obſerve, that they are attended with circumſtances which very eſſentially diſcriminate them from the thing for which they were quoted. The act of the French government was in ſubſtance a compulſory aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the property of its citizens in foreign countries. This extraordinary meaſure preſented two options to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of thoſe countries—One, to conſider the tranfer as virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally effected, and to confiſcate the property as being no longer that of the individuals, but that of the government of France—the other, to defeat the effect of her plan by buying up the property for the benefit of the original creditors, in excluſion of the drafts which they were compelled to draw. Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain appears to have elected the latter courſe. If we ſuppoſe her ſincere in the motive, and there is fairneſs and fidelity in the execution, the iſſue will be favorable, rather than detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, to the rights of private property.</p>
                     <p>I have ſaid, that there was an option to confiſcate. A go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment may rightfully confiſcate the property of an adverſary government. No principle of juſtice or policy occurs to forbid repriſals upon the public or national property of an enemy. That caſe is foreign, in every view, to the principles which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect private property. The exemption ſtipulated by the 10th article of the treaty is accordingly reſtricted to the latter.</p>
                     <p>It appears, that the government of France, convinced by the effect of the experiment, that the ſequeſtration of the property of the ſubjects of her enemies was impolitic, thought fit to reſcind it.—Thence, on the 29th of December, 1794, the convention decreed as follows:</p>
                     <p>"The decrees concerning the ſequeſtration of the property of the ſubjects of the powers at war with the republic, are annulled. Such ſums as have been paid by French citizens into the treaſury, in conſequence of thoſe decrees, will be reim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſed."</p>
                     <p>In the courſe of the debates upon this decree, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that the decrees which it was to repeal, <hi>had prepared the ruin of commerce,</hi> and had ſevered, <hi>againſt the rights of nations,</hi> the <hi>obligations</hi> of merchants in different ſtates. This is a direct admiſſion, that the ſequeſtration was contrary to the law of nations.</p>
                     <p>As far as reſpects France, then, the precedent, upon the whole, is a ſtrong condemnation of the pretended right to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcate or ſequeſter. This formal renunciation of the ground
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:028389_0486_0FD8EC0B86E59C18"/>which was at firſt taken, is a very emphatical proteſt againſt the principle of the meaſure—It ought to ſerve us too as an inſtructive warning againſt the employment of ſo miſchievous and diſgraceful an expedient. And as to England, as has been ſhown, the precedent is foreign to the queſtion.</p>
                     <p>Thus we perceive, that <hi>opinion</hi> and <hi>uſage,</hi> far from ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the right to confiſcate or ſequeſter private property, on account of national wars, when referred to the <hi>modern</hi> ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, turn againſt that right, and coincide with the principle of the article of the treaty under examination.</p>
                     <p>What remains to be offered will farther illuſtrate its propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and reconcile it to all reflecting men.</p>

                  <p>THE ſophiſtry and deception uſed by the writers in favor of the treaty, are, undoubtedly, as extraordinary as ever were attempted to be impoſed upon a thinking people like the Americans.—Camillus, the moſt zealous and the moſt caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical of its defenders, ſeems, throughout his whole perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, to proceed on the idea, that his mere aſſertions will be received, without doubt or enquiry, as oracular truths. But he will find himſelf miſerably diſappointed. His never-ending co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns will be narrowly ſcanned; and, laborious as the attempt muſt be, the grain of wheat will be ſelected from the immenſe heaps of ſurrounding chaff. I ſhall take the liberty, occaſional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to lay a few extracts from his numbers, before the public, through the medium of your paper, Mr. <hi>Bache,</hi> with very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe comments; as their abſurdity and fallacy are ſo ſelf-evident,
<q>"As to be hated, need but to be ſeen."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Britiſh patriot, who advocates ſo elaborately the moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute and doubtful rights of England, when he treats on the caſe of our unfortunate, oppreſſed, and abandoned ſailors, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:028389_0487_0FD8ECEE123A7D18"/>out of American veſſels, to ſerve againſt France, and even to aid in the piracy which is every day practiſed on our commerce, adduces the following defence of the ſhameful di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reliction of thoſe uſeful and worthy men, obſervable in the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; <hi>"the good faith of the parties"</hi> (let not the ridicule of this argument ſtiſle your reſentment, reader, yes—<hi>the good faith of England</hi>) "and the motives which they have <hi>to reſpect the rights of each other, and to avoid giving cauſes of offence,</hi> and vigilance in noting and remonſtrating againſt the irregularities which are committed, are, probably, the only peaceable ſureties of which the caſe is ſuſceptible."</p>
                  <p>The barefaced diſingenuity prevalent in this paragraph, of holding out an idea of reciprocity, as if there was any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of our impreſſing Britiſh ſeamen, can hardly be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured; as it is neither more nor leſs, than the ſpirit which runs through the treaty itſelf; therefore let that paſs.</p>
                  <p>But what ſhall be ſaid of a man, who pretends to be an American, and yet tells us, that we can have no other peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſureties, for the protection of a moſt valuable claſs of our citizens, than the <hi>"good faith of England!"</hi> His conſcience muſt have ſmote him when writing the words. Was he unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the experience America has had of Engliſh <hi>"good faith,</hi>" during the preſent war? Did he not know the immenſe extent of the depredations our merchants had ſuſtained, by a reliance on Engliſh <hi>"good faith?"</hi> Where was the operation of that <hi>"good faith,"</hi> when the captain of the Hermione im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed every man, except the captains and mates, on board above twenty American veſſels at Jeremie? What dependence can be placed in this <hi>"good faith,"</hi> when our ſailors are impreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the very port of London, notwithſtanding the reclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our conſul?</p>
                  <p>But beſides the <hi>"good faith"</hi> of our <hi>new</hi> allies, we have a further ſecurity in "the motives which the parties have <hi>to reſpect the rights of each other, and to avoid giving cauſes of offence.</hi>" Of what avail are theſe motives? Have not the Britiſh, almoſt throughout this war, ſeemingly ſtudied <hi>"to give offence"</hi> to America, if that were poſſible? Has not inſult been accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated on injury? Has their <hi>"reſpect for our rights"</hi> been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played by Rodham Home, in his piratical attempt to ſeize Mr. Fauchet within our juriſdiction? Where were the <hi>"regard for our rights"</hi> or <hi>"the motives to avoid giving cauſes of offence,"</hi> when the Algetine orders, of the 6th of November, were iſſued? Where is the wiſh to <hi>"avoid giving cauſes of offence,"</hi> when our veſſels are, even now, ſeized and carried into England?

                  <head>FROM THE LANCASTER JOURNAL. State of Opinions on the Treaty.</head>
                  <p>THERE remains no longer a doubt that the preſident has affixed his ſignature to the treaty—but, whether in the execution of this act, he has acted conformably to the voice of a majority of the citizens of the United States, requires at leaſt an inveſtigation.</p>
                  <p>We find, that in New York, the chamber of commerce, at a ſmall meeting (of about 33 members) procured a vote of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, and communicated that to the preſident as the ſenſe of the whole body of merchants, in that great commercial city.</p>
                  <p>In Boſton, not more than thirty-two of the actual mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants were ſuppoſed to appear in ſupport of it.</p>
                  <p>In Philadelphia where the <hi>mania</hi> ſeemed to have the moſt effect, and where the influence of bank directors, ſtock jobbers, &amp;c. had its full weight, 410 are ſaid to have ſigned the addreſs in favor of it.—But are theſe all merchants? No! Among them are ſhop-keepers, bookſellers, brokers, <hi>gentlemen,</hi> &amp;c.— an intermixed <hi>phalanx.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So far the mercantile intereſt, which the preſident has vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to ſay, is <hi>"directly affected."</hi> Of thoſe whoſe intereſts could not be "affected," as they were not <hi>merchants,</hi> the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is few indeed.—A meeting near Trenton, and one in the <hi>populous</hi> borough of York, were among the principal; and I think I may venture to aſſert, that not more than 400 of this claſs of partizans have collected in the whole.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="202" facs="unknown:028389_0489_0FD8EC106E5918D8"/>
Thus may we form ſome idea of the reſpectable and formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable ſupport the treaty has received—1000 merchants, ſtock-jobbers, bank-directors, and a few influenced artizans, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now let us ſearch for ſomething like a contra or ſupra credit, to overbalance this tremendous debit. In Charleſton, Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, New York, Boſton, and Portſmouth, where the meetings againſt the treaty were nearly unanimous in their voice, at leaſt 25, 000 citizens are ſuppoſed to have attended—add to this, the numerous meetings throughout the union—a recapitulation of which would be here endleſs.</p>
                  <p>"But," ſay the ſticklers of government "reſpectability of character is on our ſide; and the opponents of the treaty are perfectly unacquainted with its merits."</p>
                  <p>Strange infatuation, or criminal deception, muſt be the ground plan of this building; and ſuch a foundation can never ſupport the fabric. Out of at leaſt 40, 000 independent citizens of the United States, who preſerve the ſpirit and dignity of exerciſing their right on this intereſting occaſion, cannot a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of reſpectability be procured, to outweigh that of 1, 000 flatterers of adminiſtration!</p>
                  <p>But to expatiate on, or to extend this part of the ſubject, is needleſs, I believe every unprejudiced mind muſt be fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that the general voice was oppoſed to the treaty.</p>
                  <p>Though the preſident muſt have been acquainted with the facts, yet he has thought proper to ſanction it; and, as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms the ſelect men of Boſton, that he only purſued the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of his conſcience, it becomes our duty to acquieſce in his deciſion.</p>
                  <p>With due deference to theſe conſiderations, it may not be improper to enquire into ſome of the probable conſequences to reſult from the ratification.</p>
                  <p>Already do we find the French (in conſequence, no doubt, of the ſucceſs the treaty has met with from government) are making encroachments on our trading veſſels; and we have reaſon to fear, that before long, it may be neceſſary to ſend an envoy extraordinary to France, to claim indemnification for Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſpoliations on our commerce. But no treaty may be dreaded as the reſult.</p>
                  <p>Attempts at bawling the government into a compliance with the will of the people, would be impolitic, as it might have a diſorganizing tendency. But let us enquire if we have no peaceable reſource of amendment.</p>
                  <p>The citizens of the United States, confident of the diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of the treaty, applied in a reſpectful manner to the
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:028389_0490_0FD8EC13C787B048"/>head of their government, and amply ſtated its defects. Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of a non-compliance, they, perhaps, have not even received that attention which they had a right to expect.</p>
                  <p>As to the character and affections of the preſident, no Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican, I truſt, entertains an opinion tending to criminate him. That he is not infallible, is certain, and that he has erred, is probable; but if ſo, we ſtill poſſeſs too great a confidence in him to imagine it any thing but an "error of the judgment, and not of the heart."</p>
                  <p>If then the treaty is proved to be a public evil, let us trace it to the origin of its ratification: and the ſtar chamber movements of a myſterious ſenate, whoſe works are in darkneſs, and whoſe doors and ears are cloſed to the admiſſion of public opinions, may lead us, at leaſt, to a probable diſcovery.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps, then, it is here the calamity exiſts—here that the government is defective—and here only that the organs of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration are diſconſonant with the voice of the people.</p>
                  <p>The means of redreſs are obvious. The conſtitution of our country has anticipated our neceſſities. Let us individually and collectively inſpect the paſt conduct of our RULERS—and let the purity of elections be the rallying point of reform.</p>

                  <head>FROM THE JERSEY CHRONICLE. Obſervations on the Diſpoſition of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration to France and England.</head>
                  <p>FOR the better information of my fellow citizens of this ſtate, it may be of great importance to republiſh ſome facts, that cannot be denied, as to the conduct of the preſident of the United States, reſpecting our connexions with France and Great Britain. They will demonſtrate an uniform diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to evade a nearer alliance with France, and a cloſer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with England. As early as the 14th of February, 1791, the preſident of the United States, in a meſſage to congreſs, ſays: "Soon after I was called to the adminiſtration of the government, I found it important to come to an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding with the court of London, on ſeveral points, intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:028389_0491_0FD8EC15A14BA2C8"/>to the United States, and particularly, to know, whether they were diſpoſed to enter into arrangements, by mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, which might fix the commerce of the two nations on principles of reciprocal advantage, &amp;c. but I do not infer any diſpoſition, on their part, to enter into any arrangements, merely commercial," &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>On the 13th of December, 1791, Mr. Hammond, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh miniſter, being arrived, a letter was addreſſed to him by Mr. Jefferſon, then ſecretary of ſtate, which muſt have come from the orders of the preſident, ſaying: "as you are fully authorized to enter into a negociation, for the purpoſe of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangeing the commercial intercourſe between the two countries, I have the honor to inform you, that I am ready to receive a communication of your full powers, for that purpoſe, at any time you may think proper, and to proceed immediately to their object." Now, it does not appear, that any communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were made to the ſenate, or that they were conſulted, as to any of theſe objects.</p>
                  <p>But, upon further inveſtigation, Mr. Hammond had no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to treat with us.</p>
                  <p>On the arrival of Mr. Genet, he communicated a decree of the national convention of France, to Mr. Jefferſon, authoriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to propoſe a treaty with us, on liberal principles, ſuch as might ſtrengthen the bonds of good will, which unite the two nations, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Jefferſon, by order of the preſident, replies in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words; his letter is dated, 23d Auguſt, 1793: "<hi>the ſenate being then in receſs, and not to meet again till fall, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed Mr. Genet, that the participation, in matters of treaty, given by the conſtitution to that branch of our government</hi> [meaning the ſenate] <hi>would, of courſe, delay any definitive anſwer to his friendly propoſition.</hi>" His letter concludes, "by aſſuring the national convention, that the preſident will meet them with the moſt friendly diſpoſitions, on the grounds of treaty, as ſoon as he could do it by the forms of the conſtitution."</p>
                  <p>Obſerve, citizens, I ſtate facts. Nothing was done by the preſident, as to the obſervance of theſe promiſes, when the ſenate did meet, nor has any thing been done with the advice of the ſenate, towards that nation, to this day; and I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, from good authority, that the French nation propoſed by this treaty to give to our citizens and our ſhips, all the advantages and privileges of their own, in every part of their dominions.</p>
                  <p>On the 16th of April, 1794, a meſſage was ſent to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of the United States, by the preſident, at the very moment
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:028389_0492_0FD8EC16E01D0608"/>when the houſe of congreſs had made moſt ſalutary regulations, to preſerve and increaſe our growing commerce, announcing, that he had nominated John Jay as envoy extraordinary to Great Britain. The meſſage is in the following words:</p>
                  <p>"Gentlemen of the ſenate: The communications I have made to you, during your preſent ſeſſion, from the diſpatches of our miniſter in London, contain a ſerious aſpect of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs with Great Britain; but as peace ought to be purſued with unremitted zeal, before the laſt reſource, which ſo often has been the ſcourge of nations, and cannot fail to check the advanced proſperity of the United States, is contemplated, I have thought proper to nominate John Jay, as envoy extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary from the United States to his Britannic majeſty. My confidence in our miniſter plenipotentiary in London, continues undiminiſhed; but a miſſion like this, while it correſponds with the ſolemnity of the occaſion, will announce to the world a ſolicitude for a friendly adjuſtment of our complaints: going immediately from the United States, ſuch an envoy will carry with him a full knowledge of the exiſting temper and ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of our country, and will thus be taught to vindicate our rights with firmneſs, and to cultivate peace with ſincerity."</p>
                  <p>I will now draw ſome concluſions from the above facts, leaving it to the good ſenſe of the people of this ſtate to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, whether they are not ſuch, as naturally ariſe from this ſtatement, taken from the records and proceedings of our government.</p>
                  <p>It is evident, that the preſident has uniformly ſought a more intimate connexion with Great Britain; that he has waved the advice and participation of the ſenate, offering to treat on his own authority; that Great Britain has uniformly evaded a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, until an embargo threatened the ruin of her iſlands, and until the French nation had accompliſhed the ruin of her deſigns, and nearly the ruin of the nation.</p>
                  <p>That the forms of the conſtitution have ſlept, as innocent and inſignificant, when compared to the friendly overtures of England; but have been held up as inſurmountable barriers againſt the friendly offers of France.</p>
                  <p>That the ſenate (except ſuch as were known to favor Britiſh connexions) were ignorant, like the reſt of our citizens, that Mr. Jay's miſſion was to make a treaty of commerce and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with Great Britain. That they had no grounds to ſuppoſe or ſuſpect, from the preſident's meſſage on his appointment, that he could poſſibly have held up an object, containing the wiſhes of the whole nation, when he was to be inſtructed to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don that object. The ſenate were made to believe it neceſſary
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:028389_0493_0FD8EC186209DE00"/>to ſend a ſpecial envoy, on a ſpecial occaſion, to carry with him the ſenſibility of the nation, to vindicate our rights with firmneſs; they were told that Mr. Pinckney deſerved confidence, as to all matters not important and momentous: had they been inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that a treaty of commerce and amity was to wind up the juſt expectations of the ſufferers; that all our injuries muſt be forgotten; that we muſt bow to inſults, and kiſs the tyrant's rod; I truſt that even the ſenate would have had ſpirit enough, miſerable adviſers as they are repreſented, to have replied, "That, ſince we muſt be degraded, there is no neceſſity of ſending a ſpecial envoy, to make it ſtill more mortifying."</p>
                  <p>"If Mr. Pinckney, who is now in London, is a fit perſon to repreſent us, he is able to make a treaty of commerce."</p>
                  <p>But, to aſk advice of the ſenate to ſanctify an intended trick upon the feelings and ſenſibility of the country, might have led to a diſappointment; a majority might have put a negative on Mr. Jay's inſtructions; but, what is ſtill more important, the whole plan would have been made known to, and have been blaſted for ever by the united voice of, the people.</p>
                  <p>In my next letter, I ſhall demonſtrate clearly, that the treaty, in queſtion, abſolutely annihilates all thoſe ſoothing expectations, and all that ſenſibility, which we find ſtated and acknowledged, in the preſident's meſſage to the ſenate, on the appointment of Mr. Jay; that the nation has been ſecretly, I will not ſay treacherouſly, divorced from France, and moſt clandeſtinely married to Great Britain: we are taken from the embraces of a loving wife, and find ourſelves in the arms of a deteſtable and abandoned w—e covered with crimes, rottenneſs, and corruption.</p>

                  <head>FROM THE BOSTON CHRONICLE. Remarks on ſome of the probable Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of Mr. Jay's Treaty.</head>
                  <p>THE reply of the preſident of the convention of France to noble M. <hi>Querini,</hi> the Venetian ambaſſador, deſerves the particular attention of the citizens of the United States.</p>
                  <p>"Governed (he obſerves) by a wiſe conſtitution, directed ſolely by the principles of juſtice and reaſon, and the pureſt maxims of morality—France is on the point of enjoying the objects of her wiſhes, <hi>liberty, equality</hi> and <hi>union,</hi> the fruits of ſo many ſacrifices and labours.</p>
                  <p>"France, always great, <hi>will reply to generous proceedings,</hi> by <hi>proceedings equally generous.</hi> When, <hi>on all ſides,</hi> our riſing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public was aſſailed in its cradle, and the event appeared to be <hi>uncertain,</hi> the <hi>Venetian ſenate,</hi> not content with keeping within the bounds of <hi>neutrality,</hi> received <hi>with diſtinction</hi> the envoy of the French republic.</p>
                  <p>"We love to talk of, and publiſh <hi>our gratitude.</hi> The meaſure was ſo much the more noble, as it expoſed our faithful ally to <hi>much embarraſſment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>"France, under a <hi>deſpotic you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> might be ungrateful and treacherous; but France, reſtored to freedom, becomes a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public, which <hi>cannot</hi> be otherwiſe than <hi>grateful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>"Tell <hi>your nation</hi> that ſhe may number amongſt the <hi>moſt pure and zealous of her allies,</hi> the French republic. <hi>Holland,</hi> comprized in our treaty with <hi>Spain, proves that we do not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get our friends.</hi>"</p>
                  <p>This affectionate addreſs cannot but endear France to every benevolent heart. The language is pathetic, and the ſentiments ſincere. Far from the parade of <hi>courtly etiquette,</hi> and the <hi>cold civilities of a levee,</hi> the preſident of the convention welcomes the ambaſſador with all that fraternal affection, which the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cauſe</hi> of Liberty inſpires.</p>
                  <p>But theſe words are more particularly worthy the attention of the Americans, <hi>"France, always great, will reply to generous proceedings, by proceedings equally generous."</hi> As it reſpects the United States, can this republic think <hi>our conduct "generous?"</hi> Is it <hi>"generous"</hi> to iſſue a proclamation on the <hi>"modern law of nations,"</hi> and publicly to declare to the French, that on <hi>that ground,</hi> the United States meant to eſtabliſh <hi>their neutrality,</hi> and
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:028389_0495_0FD8EC221F070DE0"/>yet admit the Britiſh to violate it, by taking our veſſels going to France, loaded with proviſions, and other articles, expreſsly declared in the aforeſaid law to be free? Is it <hi>generous</hi> to refuſe the overtures of France, for a <hi>commercial treaty,</hi> founded on the moſt liberal principles, and at the ſame moment ſend over a miniſter to the court of Britain, <hi>apparently</hi> for the purpoſe of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining <hi>indemnification</hi> for their captures; though, at the ſame time, he was authorized to make a treaty of commerce, <hi>in a ſecret manner,</hi> without any information to the French republic, on the ſubject? More eſpecially when it was <hi>ſo ſecret,</hi> that our miniſter in France, was kept ignorant of the whole buſineſs?</p>
                  <p>Is it <hi>generous</hi> to enter into a treaty with Britain, to ſurrender the ground of <hi>"impartial neutrality"</hi> as to the <hi>modern law of nations,</hi> to admit articles as contraband, which were declared, by the <hi>preſident's proclamation,</hi> to be free, and directly claſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> with our previous promiſe to France, that "free ſhips, ſhall make free goods?"</p>
                  <p>Is it <hi>generous</hi> that our treaty with England, ſhould be ſo greatly detrimental to France, as to expreſsly declare, "that timber for ſhip-building, tar, or roſin, copper in ſheets, ſails, hemp and cordage, and generally whatever may ſerve directly to the equipment of veſſels, and unwrought iron and fir plank only excepted, <hi>ſhall be objects of confiſcation, whenever they are attempted to be carried to an enemy?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is ſuch a prohibition <hi>"generous,"</hi> as it reſpects France, when our treaty with that republic, expreſsly declares, that "in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, <hi>all proviſions,</hi> which ſerve for the nouriſhment of mankind and the ſuſtenance of life; furthermore, all kinds of cotton, hemp, flax, tar, pitch, ropes, cables, ſail cloth, anchors and any part of anchors; alſo ſhip's maſts, planks, boards, and beams; and all other things proper either for building or repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhips, and all other goods whatever, which have not been worked into the form of any inſtrument for war, by land or ſea, ſhall <hi>not be reputed contraband?</hi>"</p>
                  <p>Is it <hi>"generous"</hi> to admit by treaty the proviſions deſtined to France to be carried into England, to be diſpoſed of at ſuch a price as the <hi>miniſtry ſhall ſay is a reaſonable compenſation,</hi> when they are admitted to be ſold in France at public market, and at the higheſt price?</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, it is needleſs to <hi>query</hi> any longer upon the ſubject. The features of the treaty too ſtrongly evidence our <hi>partiality</hi> for the Engliſh, and <hi>enmity</hi> to the French. The nation now begin to ſee our conduct, and begin to expreſs their reſentment. Their late orders to their agents to ſtop the ſhipment of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, no doubt, is in conſequence of the treaty; as they find
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:028389_0496_0FD8EC2395DCBDA0"/>by this inſtrument, we have ſurrendered every right of our neutrality, deſtroyed every vital principle of the <hi>preſident's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,</hi> and completely thrown ourſelves under the ſole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul and influence of the Britiſh nation. They find we have forſaken them, and inſtead of acting agreeably to the declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made by Mr. <hi>Munroe,</hi> "to draw the bonds of our alliance cloſer," we have, by Mr. <hi>Jay's</hi> negociation, <hi>ſevered the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion,</hi> and ruſhed into the arms of the Britiſh.</p>
                  <p>This treaty will lower the produce of the United States, 100 per cent. Our ſhips will periſh at our wharves—our tradeſmen will be thrown out of employ—and, in return, we ſhall be bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a <hi>land tax,</hi> to diſcharge Britiſh debts, and our ſea-ports and trading towns ſoon be thronged with Britiſh and Scotch agents and factors. Bleſſed effects of Mr. Jay's treaty!!!</p>
                  <p>Can France expreſs that cordiality to the United States, as ſhe does to Venice? Or are our proceedings towards her, ſuch, that we can expect any thing, in return, but her reſentment?</p>
                  <p>The fate of America is ſuſpended on the treaty, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves in it a queſtion, whether we will return, by a clandeſtine treaty, to Britain, to be again ſubject to her inſolence and arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary meaſures, or whether we will ſupport that "<hi>modern</hi> neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality" pledged, to the United States, by the preſident.</p>
                  <p>The treaty, made by Mr. Jay, is in direct oppoſition to the preſident's proclamation; upon what principle <hi>he</hi> has ratified it, requires, therefore, an explanation more copious than he has deigned to expreſs in his letter to the town of Boſton, and the other citizens who have addreſſed him on this momentous ſubject.</p>
                  <p>It is in the power of America, by commercial reſtrictions, to vindicate her national honor, without any danger of a war; as we have as much right to ſay, that we will not import <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh manufactures,</hi> as France has to ſay, ſhe will not purchaſe American proviſions. The Americans may as well ſay, that they would declare war againſt France, for her late orders to her agents, as the Britiſh pretend to go to war with Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, for preventing the importation of their manufactures. The war is a mere bugbear of the Britiſh faction, and thoſe who are concerned in the Engliſh trade; as theſe very perſons know that if Mr. <hi>Madiſon's</hi> reſolutions or a non-importation had taken place, Britain would have been obliged to make peace with France.</p>
                  <p>But to our diſgrace, and poſſibly ruin, we have tampered too long with the magnanimity of this generous republic. Our narrow policy, for the ſupport of a ſet of bank ſpeculators, it is to be feared, has for ever ſeparated France from America.</p>

                     <p>AT length the illegitimate imp, the abortion of liberty, has crawled from its ſculking place, and, contrary to the wiſhes of its <hi>parent</hi> and of its <hi>god-fathers,</hi> has peeped into day. Diveſted of the darkneſs which encompaſſed it, we may now behold and examine the foul blotches that overſpread it, and trace a peſtiferous malady oozing from every pore. That imagination muſt have poſſeſſed an uncommon portion of poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic phrenzy; it muſt have boldly ſoared into the regions of extravagance, and have viewed human nature in its utmoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, that could have figured to itſelf a treaty of amity, commerce and navigation, ſo replete with hoſtility to a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and magnanimous ally, and ſo prolific of enmity to the eſſential rights of a free, ſovereign, and independent people.</p>
                     <p>Yes, citizens of America, we have <hi>virtually,</hi> though not formally, become a party in the confederacy of deſpots againſt liberty, and have ſurrendered the rights of an independent nation into the hands of Great Britain. We have become her colonies <hi>in jact,</hi> though not in form; and our honor and our intereſts, our gratitude and our liberty, are placed under her guardianſhip. The treaty formed with France, in the hour of danger and adverſity, when the heavy clouds of tyranny had darkened our horizon, and were ready to burſt upon our heads, has been paralized by our government; and the nation, againſt which every arm ſhould have been nerved, and every mind electrified with abhorrence, is to uſurp the place due to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and liberty. Now the <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>policy</hi> of our admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, nay, its <hi>patriotiſm</hi> too, will receive a full expoſition, from the treaty itſelf—Now the <hi>vindication of our rights with firmneſs</hi> will be ſeen in its meridian ſplendor—now the <hi>adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our complaints</hi> will exhibit itſelf in all its brilliancy—and now that <hi>temper and ſenſibility of our country,</hi> which was to <hi>aid,</hi> if not direct, the negociation, will ſtand unmaſked, and prompt ſenſations, at which conſcience ſhould ſtart back with horror. Let us, my fellow citizens, take a view of this mimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables bantling—its royal charms will ſmooth its conſtitutional
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:028389_0498_0FD8EC2BAD607098"/>deformity, and enamour us into an oblivion of violated rights and uſurped authority. We were tickled with the high proſpects of commercial advantage, which we were to derive from our intercourſe with the Britiſh Weſt Indies; let us view the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle upon which thoſe proſpects are bottomed, and then ſay, whether the man who could aſſent to ſuch terms, can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be conſidered as the friend of his country? We ſhall be at liberty to trade to his Britannic majeſty's poſſeſſions in the Weſt Indies, in veſſels not exceeding <hi>ſeventy tons,</hi> and bring from thence the produce of thoſe iſlands; but we ſhall not be permitted to export ſugar, coffee, cocoa, melaſſes, or cotton, to any part of the world. This article robs us, at a blow, of the carrying trade, and deprives us of the privilege of export<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Weſt India produce, although imported from other iſlands —Nay, there is not an exception in favor of cotton, the growth of our own country; and it is well known, that we export cotton from ſome of the ſouthern ſtates to a conſiderable amount. Does not this article juſtify the opinion, that we have again become the colonies of Great Britain? Does it not give riſe to a belief, that the man who put his ſeal to it, could not be a friend to America? The art with which it is incorporated with the other articles of the treaty, excepting the firſt ten, ſhows that either this was to be accepted, or the whole muſt totter, and, rather than ſuch an immaculate conception ſhould be ſtifled in embryo, we have accepted the treaty with a moſt extraordinary proviſion.</p>
                     <p>You will ſee, fellow citizens, that the treaty, in all its parts, is prohibitory upon America—You will diſcover, that the United States were an inferior party in the contract, and that when his Britannic majeſty only permits and <hi>conſents,</hi> we agree and are bound—You will ſee France pointed at, though not literally deſignated, and every proviſion, that can poſſibly mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate againſt her, ſolemnly ſtipulated—You will ſee her exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from renewing the bonds of good will, which unite the people of both countries, and which ſhe had proffered to renew, when Great Britain was plotting againſt our liberty and peace— You will ſee our country degraded, and throwing itſelf upon the mercy of a Britiſh tyrant.</p>
                     <p>Under theſe circumſtances, I aſk, nay, I demand of you, fellow citizens, whether the revolution was deſigned to rid our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or a foreign, in order to eſtabliſh a domeſtic, tyranny? Whether it was for the benefit of a whole people, or to aggrandiſe a few individuals? The queſtion is in time and in place; for if any individual among us, can purſue the dictates of his own feelings, or his own whims, at the expenſe of the moſt ſolemn
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:028389_0499_0FD8EC2C899E6AE8"/>and ſacred covenant, and in contradiction to the univerſal voice of a whole people, then have we overturned foreign to make room for domeſtic domination. The next attempt that we may anticipate, will be upon the freedom of the preſs; for a conduct ſo repugnant to every ſenſe of propriety, as that of the adminiſtration, cannot bear the ordeal of the preſs; and it muſt endeavour to ſhelter itſelf, by impoſing a ſilence upon the only voice that can ſpeak daggers to injuſtice, and awaken the public mind to tyranny. Did my imagination create it, or is it really true! Methinks there is already a conſultation of ſuch ſort, and that the patriotic and virtuous editor of the Auro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra is to be the firſt victim!</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>good faith</hi> to France, my fellow citizens, will become proverbial; and our rigid adherence to national honor, and national obligation, muſt procure many admirers and many friends. We have not only formed a treaty with Great Britain, directly to the prejudice of our allies; but we have deceived thoſe allies, and diſhonored ourſelves, by declaring to them, that the object of Mr. Jay's miſſion was only to obtain a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of wrongs. The French miniſter here was officially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that the miſſion, as ſet forth in the preſident's meſſage to the ſenate, contemplated only an adjuſtment of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; and our miniſter in France, in anſwer to an applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the French government, gave official information, that a redreſs of wrongs only, was the object of Mr. Jay's n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus have we added inſult to injury, and, by means of it, expoſed ourſelves to the juſt indignation of a great, gallant, and triumphant people. This Punic faith requires no commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of mine—it has ſtamped upon it, in lines too ſtrong to be miſinterpreted, and too indelible to be obliterated, an image, which muſt excite abhorrence in the mind of every virtuous American.</p>

                     <p>INGENUOUSNESS ought to be as much the attribute of a freeman as independence, and the forfeiture of the former is too frequently the prelude to the proſtitution of the latter. The man that can act a double, or an uncandid part, in one tranſaction, can do ſo in many; for if his conſcience or principles are not at all times powerful enough to reſtrain him,
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:028389_0500_0FD8EC2E37B46FE0"/>temptation may, any time, ſeduce him from the path of politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal juſtice or moral rectitude. I alleged, in my firſt eſſay, that France was deceived by the profeſſions of our adminiſtration, and that at the time we aſſured her we were only aiming at an indemnity for robbery, and a ſurrender of the poſts, we were, in fact, negociating a treaty with Great Britain. This decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion does not ſtand alone; for the title of the treaty bears the ſame, if not a ſtronger ſtamp of political unrighteouſneſs. It is called a "treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation, between his Britannic majeſty and the United States of America, by their preſident, <hi>with the advice and conſent of their ſenate.</hi>" I aver, that the ſenate knew not that a treaty was to be negoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated: for the preſident was ſilent on the ſubject in his meſſage; and when a motion was made in the ſenate, to requeſt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident to inform the ſenate of the <hi>whole buſineſs</hi> with which the envoy was to be charged, it was negatived; how then could it be denominated a treaty, negociated "with the advice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the ſenate?" Two concluſions are naturally drawn from this circumſtance—that the executive muſt have believed the conſtitution made the advice of the ſenate neceſſary, or he would not have had it placed on the very face of the treaty; and that a deception was practiſed by inſerting the advice of the ſenate to a treaty concluded in London, when the ſenate was not conſulted.</p>
                     <p>This ſuperceſſion of the conſtitution, and arreſtation of the prerogative of the ſenate, may be conſidered as non-eſſential, as the ſenate had an ultimate deciſion upon the treaty. A little conſideration will ſhow the fallacy and danger of this reaſoning; for if the preſident has the right to diſpenſe with the advice of the ſenate, he has an equal right to diſpenſe with their conſent, and render their participation with him in matters of treaty altogether nugatory. "The preſident ſhall have power, by and with the advice and conſent of the ſenate, to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the ſenators preſent concur." The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of this clauſe appears to be, to guard againſt the exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant power delegated to the preſident, by rendering the advice of the ſenate neceſſary to a negociation. They are the joint judges of the propriety of forming a treaty, as well as the arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of it, when it is made. If the preſident had the excluſive power to negociate treaties, it would be a kind of dictatorſhip, an excluſive ſovereignty, that would enable him to form treaties in ſuch a way, as would render it extremely hazardous in the ſenate to refuſe their conſent. Our rights may be bartered away by treaty, our liberties made an affair of hazard, as is the caſe in the treaty before us Could a free people have intended a
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:028389_0501_0FD8EC2FAB7CB890"/>delegation of ſuch powers to a ſenate, much leſs to an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual? They never intended to eſtabliſh a ſpecies of royalty in fact, though not in name, and put it in the power of <hi>one man</hi> to legiſlate for them, by means of treaties.</p>
                     <p>In the preamble of the treaty, fellow citizens, we find this remarkable clauſe: "His Britannic majeſty and the United States of America, being deſirous by a treaty of amity, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and navigation, to terminate their differences in ſuch a manner, as, without reference to the merits of their reſpective complaints and pretenſions, may be the beſt calculated to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce mutual ſatisfaction and good underſtanding." With this clauſe ſtaring us in the face, in the preamble of the treaty, what had we to expect from the treaty itſelf? Well, indeed, might Great Britain negociate with us, when we ſo complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly waved our <hi>complaints</hi> and <hi>pretenſions!</hi> The preſident, in his meſſage to the ſenate, nominating John Jay as envoy extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, ſpeaks of the miſſion being deſigned to procure a friendly <hi>adjuſtment of cur complaints.</hi> "But a miſſion like this," ſays the meſſage, "while it correſponds with the ſolemnity of the occaſion, will announce to the world, a ſolicitude for a friendly adjuſtment of our complaints:" and in the introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the treaty, theſe very complaints are abandoned! Strange paradox indeed, that the miſſion ſhould have expreſsly contemplated an adjuſtment of our complaints, if the meſſage was not an entire deception, and that a reference to thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints ſhould have been formally diſavowed! When agreements of this kind are entered into, the injuries of the parties are ſuppoſed to be equal, and their demands the ſame; but in this caſe, were our reſpective complaints and pretenſions mutual?</p>
                     <p>Had <hi>we</hi> robbed Great Britain! Had <hi>we</hi> kept poſſeſſion of a part of her territory, which was to have been ſurrendered by ſolemn and poſitive ſtipulation? Had <hi>we</hi> invaded her territory, and made military ſettlements within her juriſdiction? Had <hi>we</hi> joined the ſavages againſt her, and aſſiſted in butchering her ſubjects? Had <hi>we</hi> impreſſed her ſeamen, contrary to every rule of juſtice, and obligation of humanity? Had <hi>we</hi> offered her every outrage and every indignity, which one nation could offer to another? Whence then the mutuality of complaints and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions, that made a reference to them a thing ſo much to be deprecated, as to be entirely laid aſide? So extraordinary a phenomenon as this, is certainly not to be met with in diplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic hiſtory. It will ſtand alone upon the liſt of wonders, and ſerve as a high water mark of proſtitution of a nation's rights. Surely the envoy could not have been ſo far intoxicated with the pleaſure of kiſſing the quee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>'s hand, having already
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:028389_0502_0FD8EC31058285C0"/>paſſed the meridian of gallantry, unleſs we could ſuppoſe him to be in his dotage, as to have forgotten that we had complaints to redreſs, and pretenſions to ſatisfy! Surely Grenville's wine did not poſſeſs the qualities of the waters of Lethe, to have effaced from his remembrance that he was an <hi>American</hi> envoy, and that America had been grievouſly injured, and barbarouſly outraged!</p>
                     <p>Fellow citizens, had our condition been a deſperate one—had we been ſo humbled as to have had no reſource left but in the clemency of Great Britain—had the energy of freedom been ſucceeded by the palſy of deſpotiſm—then, indeed, might we have waved every reference to our injuries and our diſhonor: but in the zenith of vigour and proſperity, to abandon our claims, and, with a beggar's ſuppleneſs, demand our own in charity, is ſuch a flagitious departure from every principle that ought to animate the American boſom, that we ought at the ſame time to pity and deſpiſe the man who could ſo far forget his own and the dignity of his country.</p>

                  <head>REMARKS ON TREATIES.</head>
                  <p>SOME very miſtaken notions appear in circulation on this ſubject, the eſſence of which you find in a late paper, where a writer calls a treaty an act more binding than the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and more influential than any law. This is ſurely hereſy againſt the conſtitution. All that is ſaid in that inſtrument about treaties, is as follows:</p>
                  <q>
                     <bibl>In art. 2. ſect. 2.</bibl>
                     <p>"The preſident ſhall have power, by and with the advice and conſent of the ſenate, to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the ſenators concur."</p>
                  </q>
                  <q>
                     <bibl>In art. 3. ſect. 2.</bibl>
                     <p>"The judicial power ſhall extend to all caſes in law and equity, ariſing under this conſtitution, the laws of the United States and treaties made, or which ſhall be made, under their authority."</p>
                  </q>
                  <q>
                     <bibl>In art. 6.</bibl>
                     <p>"This conſtitution, and the laws of the United States, which ſhall be made in purſuance thereof—and all trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties made, or which ſhall be made, under the authority of the United States, ſhall be the ſupreme law of the land, and the judges of every ſtate ſhall be bound thereby, any thing in the conſtitution or laws of any ſtate to the contrary notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding."</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="216" facs="unknown:028389_0503_0FD8EC35A93BF820"/>
Now, ſurely, from all this, it is apparent, that, in the order ſtated, the conſtitution ſtands firſt, as the ſupreme law of the land; next, the laws of the United States, made in purſuance thereof; next, treaties: Undoubtedly, therefore, no act can be more binding than the conſtitution; no treaty more influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ential than any law paſſed by the three branches of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; otherwiſe, in fact, two branches of the government would ſuperſede entirely the authority of the third—How the judges would decide, ſhould theſe three ſupreme laws happen to differ, remains to be ſeen. It is alſo worthy of enquiry, what authority could abſolve us from a treaty made the ſupreme law of our land, ſuppoſing it violated by the other contracting party? It can hardly be ſuppoſed we ſhould go on to continue to conſider it as obligatory, when it ſhould have been broken by the party with whom it was made.</p>

                     <head>ATTICUS—No. III.</head>
                     <p>[CONTINUED FROM PAGE 215.]</p>
                     <p>AFTER reading the preamble, we might ſhut our eyes upon the treaty, and augur its contents; for when a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the merits of our complaints is poſitively forbidden in the introduction, it would be folly to look for an adjuſtment of them in the treaty it ſelf. In this, to be ſure, we have acted with much chriſtian meekneſs; we have forgotten and forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en; and, with a ſubmiſſion very uncommon to men or to nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, after being ſmote upon one cheek, we have held the other. To evidence our humility, however, it was not eſſentially ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to commiſſion the chief juſtice to proſtrate the American character and intereſt, at the foot of the throne of his majeſty, George the third—we might have been ſilent to our outrages, paſſive under our indignities, and groaned beneath our wrongs, without having them reverberated from the throne of a deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable deſpot. The <hi>"ſolemnity of the occaſion"</hi> would then have been leſs awful; for America might have <hi>mourned</hi> over her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, without inviting the world to behold her degradation. Let the light of inveſtigation, however, now ſhine upon ſuch a work of darkneſs; let its caverns be explored; let the trap doors to liberty, be unequivocally marked out, that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpecting, and yet confident, American, may behold in thoſe diſmal receſſes, the guillotine of his country's rights and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence. Be aſſured, my fellow citizens, the moment the treaty acquires a legal exiſtence in our country, that moment we naturalize an hydra, which will require an Hercules to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate him—that moment we ſign the death warrant of our liberty, and toll the bell for its execution.</p>
                     <p>Let us take a view of the 2d article, which is to relieve us from the ills of Pandora, that have iſſued, in the moſt hideous ſhapes, upon the citizens of our frontier, from the weſtern poſts, and have drained the United States of many millions of dollars, and much of the blood of their citizens. The treaty of peace ſolemnly ſtipulated, that his Britannic majeſty ſhould "<hi>with all convenient ſpeed,</hi> withdraw all his armies, garriſons, and fleets, from the United States, and from every port, place, and harbour, within the ſame;" and the preſent treaty provides
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:028389_0507_0FD8EC3C4A786F68"/>for the ſurrender of the poſts in June, 1796. Near twelve years have elapſed ſince the definitive articles, of the treaty of peace, were ſigned at Paris; and yet theſe poſts ſtill remain in the poſſeſſion of the Britiſh, and if "all convenient ſpeed" can be interpreted to mean twelve years, the evacuation, in June 1796, may be expounded to mean a century. We had a reliance upon the faith of Great Britain, at that time, and ſhe proved perfidious; we have renewed that reliance, under another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, and we flatter ourſelves ſhe will be more ſcrupulous in the obſervance of the contract! <hi>Quem Deus vult perdere pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us dementat;</hi> we ſeem to be marked for deſtruction, and folly is paving the way for it.</p>
                     <p>By this article, the king has been <hi>"graciouſly pleaſed"</hi> (to uſe the language of the envoy) to permit the United States to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their ſettlements within <hi>their own boundary line,</hi> at their diſcretion, except within the precincts or juriſdiction of any of the poſts. What a favor! The treaty is ſaid to contain no reciprocity; but is not this reciprocity enough! To be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to extend our ſettlements within <hi>our own territory,</hi> is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, for which we cannot be ſufficiently grateful! What a pity the envoy did not obtain his majeſty's gracious permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to enlarge the boundaries of Philadelphia or New York! So <hi>"great, good, and dear a friend"</hi> could certainly not have refuſed <hi>"ſuch an envoy"</hi> ſuch a requeſt!!!</p>
                     <p>The vocabulary of ſubmiſſion appears to have been ranſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to ſuit the American part of the treaty (if any part can be ſtrictly called American) and the rights which valour gave, and blood confirmed, we ſeem now to receive as a boon.—Does not this article contain a tacit confeſſion, that Great Britain had a right to prevent our ſettlements within our own bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry line? Why was it not ſtipulated equally on the part of Great Britain, that ſhe ſhould be allowed to extend her ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, at her diſcretion, within the Canadian limits? She never would have ſtooped to ſuch an inſult.</p>
                     <p>But what are WE to underſtand by the precincts or juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the poſts? The Britiſh have given a very liberal al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of territory to that juriſdiction, and, in ſome inſtances, they have been modeſt enough to claim an extenſion of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts to the Ohio.—Who is to draw the line? No doubt this will receive an expoſition, in the uſual way, and a <hi>Britiſh</hi> lex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icon will be found to explain this knotty point. We have an adminiſtration ſo complaiſant, that they never can find it in their hearts to cavil with his majeſty George the Third. Whatever quirks and quibbles may be made uſe of to French <hi>ſans culottes, a king</hi> is certainly entitled to more deference and more reſpect.
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:028389_0508_0FD8EC44633FF8B8"/>—Quere. Is the ſettlement which <hi>Simcoe</hi> made at the rapids of the Miami, and about which a <hi>hollow vociferation</hi> was made, within the precincts and juriſdiction of the poſts? That eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch of a ſtateſman, whoſe political gender remains yet to be defined, and who is <hi>"every thing by turns, and nothing long,"</hi> will deign to inform us.</p>
                     <p>The moſt extraordinary part of this article, fellow citizens, remains yet to be conſidered—a part which allows a Britiſh colony to be eſtabliſhed within the juriſdiction of the United States. Britiſh ſubjects ſhall have their election either to remain ſubjects of Great Britain, within the precincts or juriſdiction of the poſts, or to become American citizens! We have often been ſtunned with the <hi>"imperium in imperio:"</hi> but what will be now ſaid of a <hi>Britiſh imperium</hi> in <hi>an American imperio!</hi> We cannot charge this to <hi>ſelf-creation,</hi> when the firſt of our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment has given it a being. By this article, we have given a <hi>carte blanche</hi> to conſpiracy, and a premium for inſurrections againſt our government. By the conſtitution of the United States, treaſon conſiſts "in levying war againſt the United States, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort."—Now I would aſk, whether, according to the ſecond article of the treaty, a Britiſh ſubject, within the precincts or juriſdiction of the poſts, who has not elected to become an American citizen, can be guilty of treaſon? May he not levy war, give aid and comfort to OUR enemies, without incurring the penalties to which American citizens are ſubject?</p>
                     <p>"They ſhall not be compelled to take any oath of allegiance to the government;" but, owing allegiance to Great Britain, by <hi>poſitive compacts,</hi> is he not furniſhed with a ſecurity againſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for acts, which are treaſonable to us, but which his ſovereign calls on him to perform? The <hi>tacit</hi> condition of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubject to the laws, cannot ſurely operate againſt a <hi>ſpecific grant;</hi> and a Britiſh ſubject, within that juriſdiction, ſeems to be excluded from the general principle comprehended in the law of nations. In the 26th article, a remedy is provided againſt Britiſh merchants who ſhall tranſgreſs our laws; but, in the article before us, nothing of the ſort is contemplated. If there was not to be a difference between the perſons comprehended in the 29th article, and thoſe comprehended in the 2d, why were they not equally expreſſive? It appears, that his majeſty was deſirous of ſecuring a corps within our territory, that would always be devoted to him, whenever he ſhould call for their ſervices, and, in caſe of a war, they might prove uſeful inſtruments, as uſeful as the ſavages, in carrying his gracious intentions into effect.</p>

                     <p>THE teleſcope of Herſchel is neceſſary to diſcover the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatages ſaid to be contained in the treaty with Great Britain; for they are ſo diſtant and ſo obſcure, that, like the mountains in the moon, they can only be ſeen through an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary magnifying medium. We are told, that the oftener we view the treaty, the more we will like it; but although a repetition of impreſſion diminiſhes our ſenſations, even with reſpect to the beauty or deformity of things, the treaty ſtands an unrivalled exception; for the oftener we gaze at it. the more do the features of deformity unfold themſelves to ſhock the ſenſe. Reciprocity ought to be the baſis of all commercial trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but this inſtrument diſcovers ſuch favoritiſm, that we look in vain for equality; for while the ghoſt of reciprocity is to be
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:028389_0512_0FD8EC4FCE04B6F0"/>our portion, the ſubſtantial reality is embraced by Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. In illuſtration of this, let us refer to the 3d article, and purſue the <hi>ignis fatuus</hi> through the bogs and quagmires con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived for the ingenuous and unſuſpecting American.—</p>
                     <p>"It is agreed that it ſhall, at all times, be free to his majeſty's ſubjects, and to the citizens of the United States, and alſo to the Indians dwelling on either ſide of the ſaid boundary line, freely to paſs and re-paſs by land or inland navigation, into the reſpective territories and countries of the two parties on the continent of America (the country within the limits of the Hudſon's Bay company excepted) and to navigate all the lakes, rivers, and waters thereof, and freely to carry on trade and commerce with each other. But it is underſtood, that this article does not extend to the admiſſion of veſſels of the United States into the ſea ports, harbours, bays, or creeks of his majeſty's ſaid territories; nor into ſuch parts of the rivers in his majeſty's ſaid territories, as are between the mouth thereof, and the higheſt port of entry from the ſea, except in ſmall veſſels trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>bona fide</hi> between Montreal and Quebec, under ſuch regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations as ſhall be eſtabliſhed to prevent the poſſibility of any frauds in this reſpect. Nor to the admiſſion of Britiſh veſſels from the ſea into the rivers of the United States, beyond the higheſt port of entry for foreign veſſels from the ſea. The river Miſſiſſippi ſhall, however, according to the treaty of peace, be entirely open to both parties; and it is further agreed, that all the ports or places on its eaſtern ſide, <hi>to whichſoever of the parties belonging,</hi> may freely be reſorted to, and uſed by both parties, in as ample a manner as any of the Atlantic ports or places of the United States, or any of the ports or places of his majeſty, in Great Britain."</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Unequal</hi> as are the benefits which the contracting parties have to beſtow, theſe benefits are far from being reciprocal to the United States, although the whole inland navigation, forming a ſemicircle from the mouth of the Miſſiſſippi to the river St. Lawrence, together with the Atlantic waters, are thrown open to Great Britain. Are the territories and countries of the two parties on the continent, equal, and if they are equal, are the privileges granted to both, the ſame? for there muſt be an entire equality, to conſtitute the boaſted reciprocity.—What are the limits of the Hudſon's Bay company, from which there is to be an excluſion?</p>
                     <p>The returns of the Hudſon's Bay company from America, are in value £. 29, 340 ſterling, annually, and from the limits of this company we are to be totally excluded.—This company engroſſes the moſt valuable part of the fur trade, as the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try over which their privileges extend, abounds with animals
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:028389_0513_0FD8EC52EF456CD8"/>whoſe furs are preferable to thoſe inhabiting a leſs northerly region. Thus we have not only refuſed interfering with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable branch of their commerce, but we have afforded them an opportunity of extending it to our own prejudice; for when their traders are at liberty to make ſettlements within our ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory, to "hire and poſſeſs houſes and ware houſes" we are wholly interdicted, and, therefore, there can be no doubt on which ſide the current of advantage will run.</p>
                     <p>We have granted Great Britain the free navigation of <hi>all our waters,</hi> internal and Atlantic, to the higheſt port of entry, when ſhe has excluded us from the limits of the Hudſon's Bay com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and all her Atlantic ports in America. The privilege of trading between Montreal and Quebec, if it can merit this appellation, is on the other ſide; for the inhabitants of New York, bordering on Canada, will derive their ſupplies from thence, and thus afford an additional outlet for Britiſh manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures. It is a queſtion, and the <hi>expreſſion</hi> of this article will warrant it, how far we are liberty to avail ourſelves of the privilege granted by the treaty of peace, to dry our fiſh, or to take them in any place where the juriſdiction of Great Britain is acknowledged? By the treaty of peace we are allowed "to take fiſh on all the coaſts, bays and creeks of his Britannic ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's dominions in America, and to dry and cure fiſh in any of the unſettled bays, harbours, and creeks of Nova Scotia, Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen Iſlands, and Labradore, ſo long as the ſame ſhall remain unſettled;" by the preſent treaty we are barred this privilege— "But it is underſtood, that this article does not extend to the admiſſion of veſſels of the United States into the ſea ports, <hi>har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, bays</hi> or <hi>creeks</hi> of his majeſty's ſaid territories." It may be ſaid, that this article cannot be intended to prejudice a previous treaty, and that this muſt have been underſtood—To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that, if the poſitive ſtipulation in the treaty of peace, that his majeſty ſhould withdraw all his armies, &amp;c. from the United States, without cauſing any deſtruction, or <hi>carrying away any negroes or other property</hi> of the American inhabitants," could be ſet aſide, it is not difficult to conceive, that the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of taking and curing fiſh might be equally diſpenſed with by the treaty manufacturers.—It is no forced conſtruction of the article, to ſuppoſe it; and the unequivocal expreſſion of it, will juſtify ſuch a belief.</p>
                     <p>We have not yet been able to trace a reciprocity in this arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; but perhaps we ſhall find it in the Miſſiſſippi. This river is to be open to both parties and all the ports and places on its eaſtern ſide, to whichſoever of the parties belonging, may freely be reſorted to. Where are the ports and places on the Miſſiſſippi,
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:028389_0514_0FD8EC580D1BC620"/>belong to Great Britain? Does this article yield a <hi>quid pro quo?</hi> Perhaps this ſtipulation in favor of the beloved friend of our adminiſtration, is intended to accelerate the negociation with Spain, which has been ſo long pending! Will Spain conſent to open the Miſſiſſipi to us, when we have divided the benefits with Great Britain? Can it be ſuppoſed that ſhe will have leſs jealouſy of both, than ſhe had of one? Events will determine theſe queſtions; and I have no ſcruple in ſuppoſing, that our negociation with Spain will be exceedingly embarraſſed, if not broken off, by this injudicious and impolitic clauſe. It is not improbable that the French republic will poſſeſs Louiſiana, and if they ſhould, will this article be a letter of recommendation to them? We have acted ſo <hi>honorably,</hi> ſo <hi>candidly,</hi> ſo <hi>affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,</hi> and ſo <hi>uprightly</hi> with France, that ſhe certainly could refuſe us nothing we would aſk of her.</p>
                     <p>We are ſaid to have a conſtitution; and the citizens who were not entirely ſatisfied with its adoption, and thoſe citizens who can ſee defects in the adminiſtration of it, are ſtiled <hi>"antife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deraliſts."</hi> I would now aſk, fellow citizens, by what title thoſe are to be hailed, who are undermining that conſtitution by the exerciſe of improper power? The conſtitution ſays, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs ſhall have power "to eſtabliſh an <hi>uniform rude</hi> of naturali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation throughout the United States," but by the ad article of the treaty, the preſident and ſenate have eſtabliſhed a rule of naturalization within the precincts and juriſdiction of the poſts. The <hi>pretended federaliſts</hi> will ſupply a name for ſo daring an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack upon a conſtitution which they have extolled as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of human wiſdom.</p>

                     <p>THE ground of regular defence being abandoned by the Jayites, recourſe is had to buſh fighting; and we are told, that it is improper and dangerous to deliver the opinion of an aggregate body on the meaſures of government. This is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as an attempt to dictate to our government, to controul its actions, nay, to awe it into compliance with the popular voice. Whether the popular voice, in a popular government, ought to dictate public meaſures, I ſhall proceed to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and, from this digreſſion, return again to the treaty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="226" facs="unknown:028389_0515_0FD8EC599525A688"/>
If the propriety or the right of many to give an opinion on public meaſures is a queſtionable thing, the right of an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual muſt altogether vaniſh; for the right or wrong, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety or impropriety, in a republican ſenſe, is proportionate to the many or the few, who deliver an opinion. If a majority is to direct the public will, then the expreſſion of that majori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty muſt be proper and juſt; and the nearer the approach to that majority, the ſtronger the right to a direction of that will. A nation has the right to will; and this will, in a legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate government, can only be expreſſed by the majority, and ought only to be operative, when this is aſcertained; ſurely, then, the right is in an aſcending ſeries, from an individual to the majority. If the right of many is then to be queſtioned, what will become of the pretenſions of an individual? for it ſurely will not be contended by a republican, that one man ſhall have more conſideration and more rights than a number. The majority of the people of America declared themſelves independent of Great Britain; and this was ſuppoſed by them a meritorious and juſt declaration, and dare not, even now, be queſtioned by the ariſtocrats, but, according to the preſent doctrine, this was an unpardonable act; for it was an attack upon the "conſtituted authorities," it was a ſubverſion of the ſettled order of things. The majority of the people of the United States, made a conſtitution for their government; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>hinged the old ſyſtem of things under the confederation; ſurely this was an unjuſtifiable act; for it was a meaſure which deranged the conſtituted authorities. It the people had a right to throw off their allegiance from Great Britain, if they had a right to ſubvert the confederation and eſtabliſh a conſtitution, will their right be queſtioned to expreſs diſapprobation of an iniquitous law? Dare a queſtion be agitated, whether they have the right to give an opinion to the conſtituted authorities, nay, to change the conſtituted authorities themſelves? Suppoſe the majority of the people were to declare the preſent conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution anti-republican, that it was unfriendly to their liberties, who would diſpute their right to make another? will ſuch ephemerons as Fenno and Webſter oppoſe ſuch a will, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovert ſuch a doctrine? Who will be bold enough to ſay, that the people have not the right to will their own happineſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any form of government, and under what laws they pleaſe? Is our government a purchaſe in fee ſimple, or an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that the people have no right to interfere in its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations?</p>
                     <p>Is ours a government of the people, or of the officers of government: If it is a government of the people, they cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:028389_0516_0FD8EC5B514DEA98"/>have the right to ſay by what rules they will be regulated; for it is a ſoleciſm to ſay, a man is his own governor, when he is denied a voice on public meaſures. If it is a government of the rulers, then is our ſyſtem changed, and, inſtead of a republic, we are in oligarchy. Although the doctrine which I have been combating, implies that we are not a government of the people, but that of an oligarchy, will any one, on that ſide of the queſtion, come forward and avow the ſentiment? Art and deſign have too much to do with it to be thus explicit.</p>
                     <p>To proſcribe town meetings, or indeed any other mode of collecting the ſenſe of the people, is not extraordinary for men who have a point to gain. It is as eaſy for them to pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrize as to condemn, when their purpoſes can be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed; and, contradictory as this may ſeem, the fact will appear, by referring to the Gazette of the United States, or any other paper under the ſame influence. When the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent's proclamation of neutrality appeared, the legality and propriety of it were ſeverely arraigned, and, under theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, it was thought proper to convene town meetings, in many parts of the ſtates, to approbate the meaſure. The merchants of Philadelphia had a meeting, and marched in grave and ſolemn proceſſion to deliver their addreſs, in its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, to the preſident. If aggregate opinions were not improper, at that time, by what rule of ratiocination will they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned now? Were they more orderly then than they are now? This certainly will not be alleged; for there is not an inſtance upon record, in which a town meeting was conducted with more order, more decorum, and more harmony, than the late one at the ſtate houſe. Perhaps they were compoſed of a better order of beings at that time; and, from their ſuperior conſideration, legitimized a thing in themſelves, that would have been criminal in others.</p>
                     <p>When men apply their ſcaling ladders to the citadel of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicaniſm itſelf, no wonder they ſhould attack its out-poſts; for if the citadel is not conſecrated againſt invaſion, its lines cannot expect ſecurity. Look into the Minerva and the Gazette of the United States, and behold republicaniſm itſelf arraigned; what ſecurity have we then to expect for an attribute, that is denied to the being itſelf! When eſſays and paragraphs in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of <hi>monarchy</hi> can find a channel to the public eye, we muſt not be ſurpriſed at the more inſidious means of undermining liberty. We well know that government does not wiſh an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the public ſentiment which arraigns the propriety of its meaſures; and we cannot doubt that every means will
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:028389_0517_0FD8EC611B02CB80"/>be uſed, to prevent that ſentiment from converging to a focus; we muſt, therefore, expect that every artifice, which cunning and ſophiſtry can ſuggeſt, will be employed to confute and confound. Inſulated opinions are treated with indifference; but combined ones ſpeak to the fears, as well as to the intereſts of rulers, and command attention; every means will, therefore, be uſed to prevent a co-operation in the people, and hence the proſcription of the late town meetings.</p>
                     <p>From this view of the ſubject, fellow citizens, I am war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted in the inference, that town meetings, or any other meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in which the ſenſe of the people can be collected, are republican and proper; and that no one will diſpute their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, whoſe intereſt is not diſtinct from that of the whole people. That they ſhould be proſcribed by men who have am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to gratify, and other feelings to cheriſh, is not in the leaſt ſurpriſing; for Eſau ſold his birth-right for a meſs of pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; and Judas ſold his maſter for thirty pieces of ſilver.</p>
                     <p>As argument fails, recourſe muſt be had to other means to make the treaty acceptable; and hence the proſcription of town meetings, the calumnious epithet of Jacobin and anti-federaliſt, and the appeals to our fears and to our affections.

                     <p>THE other part of the 11th reaſon is more ſerious, and is "Becauſe it is ſtipulated that neither the debts due from individuals of one nation, to individuals of the other, nor ſhares, nor monies, which they may have in the public funds, or in any public or private banks, ſhall ever, in any event of war or national differences, be ſequeſtered or confiſcated. It is far
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:028389_0518_0FD8EC6448FF3900"/>from being impoſſible, that the exerciſe of this right may, in the opinion of the national legiſlature, contribute to preſerve the peace of our country; and protect the rights and property of the citizens from violation: we therefore eſteem it highly impolitic that the public faith ſhould be pledged that it ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be exerciſed, under any circumſtances whatever."</p>
                     <p>It will not be denied, after ſome little reflexion, by the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Boſton, that credit is of the laſt importance to the people of the United States. It is that which nurtured our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, which now gives ſpring and vigour to all our exertions, public and private. Its invigorating effects have been evidenced in the hiſtory of the publie, and of individuals, in ſuch ſtrong and recent colours, as to leave no doubt that we are indebted to that, for our rapid advance to wealth and importance. Let the town of Boſton be contemplated with its great and thriving commerce. Is it not mutual confidence, is it not credit that ſupports the greateſt part? Conſider the wealth that is flowing in upon us from every country, confided to the honor of our merchants, and the juſtice of our laws—Weaken this confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, wound credit but in the ſmalleſt degree, and you will ſee a thouſand hands, which now labour for their own emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the public proſperity, palſied in an inſtant.</p>
                     <p>There is ſcarce an individual who would not revolt with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror at the ſuggeſtion, that, becauſe his nation was at war with the nation of his creditor, he ſhould refuſe to pay what was juſtly due. It is grown into a maxim, the truth of which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly felt, and aſſented to by every man of probity, that ſo far as reſpects himſelf, no national differences ought to weaken the obligations he is under to an individual.</p>
                     <p>The writer of theſe remarks firmly believes, that there is not a citizen of Boſton who would declare, he conſidered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf diſcharged from the debt, due by him, becauſe there was a war between his own nation, and that of his creditor.</p>
                     <p>Foreign credit is the parent of domeſtic credit. There is no man, who will view the extent and importance of the former, but will be convinced, that an injury to that will annihilate the latter, and with it all the domeſtic labour and induſtry, origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating from, and ſupported by it.</p>
                     <p>Do the inhabitants ſuppoſe that the government would attain any thing by ſequeſtering or confiſcating the debts of individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als? Let them recur to their own experience of what took place the laſt war, when individuals were required to pay into the public treaſury what was due to their abſent creditors; and they will be convinced, that inſtances of compliance were ſo rare, as to leave no doubt that f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>With reſpect to money in the public funds, the practice of nations and the authority of the moſt eminent writers on pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic law, has, long ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nce, condemned the practice of ſequeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or confiſcating them—and it is laid down as the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged law, among all the modern nations, that "a ſtate at war, does not ſo much as touch the ſums which it owes to the enemy—Every where, in caſe of a war, funds credited to the public, are exempt from confiſcation and ſeizure." The policy of a conduct, in the United States, leſs ſcrupulous in regard to national faith and honor, may juſtly be queſtioned. The baneful effects of war on the morals of a people, are always lamented as the greateſt calamity that awaits that dreadful peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilence. Can there be any thing more deſtructive of that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which exalteth a nation, than the example ſet by a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, of converting the confidence placed in it, by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpecting individual, into a trap to deprive him of his proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty! The principle, adopted at the fountain head, would ſoon ſpread through all the branches, and involve in deeper diſtreſs, the unfortunate victims of war, than all the loſſes of quiet and property. War, in its mildeſt form, is to be deprecated as the greateſt evil. War, thus commenced, would be deſtructive of private confidence, and leave us the ſlav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s of vice and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, without character and without credit. The reaſon ſtates, that "It is far from being impoſſible that the exerciſe of this right may, in the opinion of the national legiſlature, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to preſerve the peace of our country, and protect the rights and property of the citizens from violation."</p>
                     <p>Few men who are actuated by a pure love for their country, would wiſh to derive its ſafety from a conviction in the world, that it has abandoned thoſe principles of honeſty, and regard to public and private farm, which are commonly practiſed among nations.</p>
                     <p>But ſuppoſing there are ſuch, let them remember that our own citizens have property in other countries—that the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of depriving foreigners of the confidence now entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our laws and government, if they chooſe to riſque their property in America, will be a payment on our part for every riſque they run—that means will not be wanting by which their credits may be ſecreted from public graſp. Let us go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and grant that ſuſpicions of war with this country, could not have guarded men, thus adviſed of our principles, from being enſnared—that we were ſo ſudden in commencing hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>es, as to afford no chance of eſcape; and to give to this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtrous
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:028389_0520_0FD8EC671A75BA38"/>and diſgraceful warfare, all the effect that could poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſlow from it—is it probable ſuch a meaſure would prevent war, would protect the rights and property of our citizens from violation? Would not the nation thus injured, immediately make repriſals, long before we could build ſhips of war to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port this ſeizure, or call home our own defenceleſs property. Let it be remembered, in contemplating this ſubject, that the nations of Europe have large ſleets; that we are without any; that our veſſels ſail unguarded, and unarmed; every moment liable to be taken, while theirs are, in many inſtances, protected with military force.</p>
                     <p>Such a principle, once adopted, temptations to war would be multiplied to a nation whoſe intereſt is concerned in the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation of peace. War muſt be carried on by credit, either borrowing at home or abroad. The current revenues of no country are ſufficient to meet the expenſes of war. In propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our credit, or want of it, muſt we pay for the means of fighting our enemy. There can be no doubt but a war under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with ſuch an oppoſition to the received maxims of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic faith, would be attended with difficulties and expenſes in the procuring of money, that would infinitely outweight any amount of property thus ſequeſtered or confiſcated. As little doubt can there be, that at the making of peace we ſhould be willing to contract for the payment of property thus detained.</p>
                     <p>It may be fairly inferred, that no ſuch right, as the town con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templates, exiſts, according to the law of nations—that if ſuch right did exiſt, it could in no caſe be expedient to exerciſe it. But that the inſertion of ſuch an article in a treaty, ſhould be an objection to its ratification, ſpeaks a language, which, it is ſincerely hoped, the town, on more nature reflection, will completely diſcard.</p>
                     <p>The reverſe of the poſition is more true, viz. That a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction on the mind of all foreigners, that the United States would in no inſtance, touch the credits or property of aliens, confided either to their private citizens or the public ſaith, would contribute to preſerve the peace of our country, and protect the rights and properties of the citizens from violation.

                        </gap>tely certain this was made to foreigners, with the more confidence would they place their monies and other property in our country. Beſide the beneficial effects derived from this credit, is caſe of any national difference or miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, there would be a large and influential part of the foreign community deeply intereſted in preſerving the peace of America; in protecting from violation the rights and property

                        <pb n="234" facs="unknown:028389_0522_0FD8EC6D782FAEA8"/>as it was called. Thus much is certain, that <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> who was the moſt potent of the league, is now in cloſe alliance with Britain, and, of courſe, would not promote the ſyſtem ſhe adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the laſt war.</p>
                     <p>We have conceded no new rights; we have not ſurrendered any principles advantageous to ourſelves. The law ſtands pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely as it did before the treaty; and it is not probable, that the United States had any boon to offer, which could induce Britain to invert the rule, as now acknowledged by nations. When it is conſidered, that ſhe is at war, and we at peace— and that ſhe appears to found her greateſt hope of ſucceſs againſt her enemies on her naval ſtrength, it ſhould alſo be remembered, that though France expreſsly ſtipulated, in her treaty with the United States, that the goods of her enemies, on board our veſſels, ſhould be free, yet, in many inſtances, ſhe has choſen to ſwerve from this ſtipulation, and capture and confiſcate the property of her enemy on board our ſhips.</p>
                     <p>The words of the reaſon, that the treaty "precludes the hope of receiving any advantage," &amp;c. (if the principle before mentioned is what the town alludes to) extend further than is warranted by the treaty; for, in that inſtruments, there is the following ſtipulation—"The ſaid parties will alſo renew their diſcuſſion, <hi>and endeavour to agree,</hi> whether in any, and in what caſes, neutral veſſels ſhall protect enemies' property." It can hardly be ſaid, that a treaty "precludes all hope" of a benefit, when the parties have expreſsly contracted to renew a diſcuſſion thereon, and endeavour to agree in what caſes it ſhall be made.</p>
                     <p>The 16th reaſon is, "Becauſe it not only ſurrenders the right of carrying the property of any nation at war with Great Britain, in our veſſels freely, but abandons all pretenſions even to the freight."</p>
                     <p>It has been ſhown, in the remarks on the 15th reaſon, that we have no right, by the law of nations, to carry the property of a nation at war with Great Britain, free from ſeizure. If, therefore, the treaty expreſsly recognizes the principle, that enemy's property is liable to confiſcation, though on board the veſſel of a friend, it does no more than the government has done before. It ſurrenders no right; for no right thus to protect enemics' goods, exiſts between us and Great Britain.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon further ſtates, "That the treaty abandons all pretenſions even to freight."</p>
                     <p>The writer of theſe remarks has looked, with attention, through the treaty, to find the clauſe on which this aſſertion
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:028389_0523_0FD8EC700A2B2640"/>is made; he can really find none that will ſupport it. "Effects belonging to an enemy, found on board a neutral ſhip, are ſeizable by the rights of war; but, by the law of nature, the maſter is to be paid his freight, and not to ſuffer by the ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure." There is nothing in the treaty to controvert this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, declared by <hi>Vattel.</hi> It cannot be doubted, that in all caſes, where, prior to the ratification of the treaty, freight is paya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for goods of an enemy to Britain, found on board of an American veſſel, the ſame will be equally payable, when the treaty is ratified, if that event ſhould take place. For there is nothing in the treaty, that can imply a relinquiſhment of our rights, by the law of nations, much leſs an abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all pretenſions to freight, in ſuch caſes. In the latter part of the 17th article of the treaty, there is an expreſs agreement to pay freight, where, by law, it could not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
                     <p>The 17th reaſon is, "Becauſe it permits the Britiſh nation to convert proviſions, deſtined to other nations at war with them, to their own uſe, on payment of what they may deem a reaſonable profit; a meaſure not only injurious to the intereſts of the American merchant, but which will prevent our citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens from carrying thoſe ſupplies to other countries, which, by the laws of nature and nations, they have a right to do, without moleſtation."</p>
                     <p>It is preſumed, that the town, in this reaſon, refers to the 17th article of the treaty. An examination of that article will ſhow, that the town has miſtaken its import; and that, inſtead of ſurrendering a right, it acquires one, to which we are not entitled, unleſs the treaty is ratified. All writers on the law of nations agree, that there are caſes, in which proviſions are contraband; though it would ſeem, by the generality of the expreſſions of the town, in the laſt paragraph of this reaſon, that there is a right to carry ſupplies, in all caſes, without moleſtation. It can hardly be believed, that this was the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the town; yet, if any ſhould think thus, they may have the conſolation to reflect, that there is nothing in this treaty, that prevents an endeavour to ſupport ſuch a propoſition— the words being, "where, by <hi>the exiſting law of nations,</hi> they are contraband." Now, if there is no caſe, where, by the law of nations, they are contraband, then there is no right to ſeize them under that article.</p>
                     <p>The article in the treaty, ſtates, "That whereas the difficulty of agreeing on the preciſe caſes, in which alone, proviſions and other articles, not generally contraband, may be regarded as ſuch, renders it expedient to provide againſt the inconveniencies
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:028389_0524_0FD8EC73EED019B0"/>and miſunderſtandings which might thence ariſe: It is further agreed, that whenever any ſuch article, ſo becoming contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, according to the exiſting law of nations, ſhall for that reaſon be ſeized, the ſame ſhall not be confiſcated, but the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers thereof ſhall be ſpeedily and completely indemnified; and the captors, or, in their default, the government under whoſe authority they act, ſhall pay the full value of all articles, with a reaſonable mercantile profit thereon, together with the freight, and alſo the demurrage incident to ſuch detention." Hence it is clear, that the treaty does not give any new right to the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh nation; it does not permit the taking proviſions, &amp;c. in any caſe where ſhe is not authorized by the law of nations—it permits the taking them only where, by the <hi>exiſting law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they are contraband.</hi> Here is no cauſe of complaint.— The other part of the article is a poſitive advantage to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at peace; for it expreſsly contracts to pay for ſuch provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, where, by law, the nation ſeizing them would be under no obligation to pay, viz. in caſes, where, by the exiſting law of nations, they are contraband; and in no other caſe are they ſeizable by treaty. The article goes further; it not only ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates for payment, but for complete and ſpeedy indemnifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reaſonable profits, freight and demurrage, and that the government ſhall pay, if the individual captors ſhall ſail. It is injurious to the intereſt of the American merchant, that, in caſes where his property is, by the law of nations, juſtly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited, the treaty ſecures to him full and complete indemnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, payment with profit, freight and demurrage? Will our citizens be prevented from carrying ſupplies to other countries, becauſe the hazards are leſſened—becauſe, in every event, they are ſure of making a good voyage? Surely the anſwers will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the reaſons of the town.</p>
                     <p>The 18th reaſon given by the town, is, "Becauſe it limits the power of congreſs, delegated to them by the conſtitution, to regulate our commerce with foreign nations, by preſcribing conditions, and creating impediments to the exerciſe of that power."</p>
                     <p>The conſtitution, in the diſtribution of powers, as completely veſts the powers delegated to the preſident and ſenate, as it veſts thoſe it delegates to congreſs. The preſident has power, by and with the advice and conſent of the ſenate, to make treaties; when, therefore, he thus makes a treaty, it is as much an act of the whole people of the United States, as any law of congreſs. Is he limited as to the kind of trea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap> he ſhall make? There is no limitation in the conſtitution. But then it is ſaid, "Congreſs has a right to regulate commerce with foreign
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:028389_0525_0FD8EC7549A49CD8"/>nations; and, as this treaty regulates commerce with a foreign na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it limits the power of congreſs;" and ſuppoſe it does, if it is a conſtitutional act, the limitation is as legal, as though the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution had declared in expreſs terms, that congreſs ſhould have a right to regulate commerce, where it was not otherwiſe regulated by treaty. Perhaps it may be ſaid, that the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion intended ſuch treaties, as did not interfere with the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers delegated to congreſs. The inference, from this conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would be, that no commercial treaty could ever be made; and, looking at the powers of congreſs, it will be doubtful if any other treaty can be made, or if the United States can make any treaty—for congreſs has no power to make a treaty—and if the preſident, who, with the advice and conſent of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, is alone authorized to make treaties, can make no treaty, which reſpects any of the powers, veſted in congreſs, there is no man or body of men authorized to treat with foreign na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>Treaties, generally ſpeaking, are mere treaties of peace, or treaties of commerce; congreſs has power to make war, grant letters of marque and repriſal. If the preſident with conſent of the ſenate, makes a treaty of peace, according to the reaſoning of the town, he limits the power of congreſs, which has au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to make war, and in the treaty ſpoken of there is a ſtipulation, that there ſhall be a firm and inviolable peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the parties—It is equally objectionable on this ground, as on that of regulating commerce. If the United States ſhould be at war with any nation, on ſuch conſtruction, they muſt remain eternally at war—congreſs has declared war—has done an act which that body alone had a right to do; the preſident, by making peace, does not barely limit a power to act; but does that which is in direct violation of an act conſtitutionally done by congreſs, and operates as an abſolute repeal of their declaration of war. Such a conſtruction of the conſtitution is not to be admitted.</p>
                     <p>We ought never to admit a conſtruction of any inſtrument, which leads to an abſurdity, or to the deſtruction of any part; we ought to reconcile all parts thereof, if poſſible, ſo that every portion of it may take effect, and no word but what may ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in ſome ſhape or other. Let us endeavour to conſtrue this inſtrument by theſe rules:—The preſident, with the adviſe and conſent of the ſenate, makes a treaty of peace with a nation, with whom the United States are at war. He has done an act which he thought wiſe; the next or the ſame day, congreſs receives ſuch information, as, in their opinion, renders it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to declare war. This militates with what was done;
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:028389_0526_0FD8EC7A944C8C68"/>but it by no means follows that either was wrong; or that the conſtitutional power of either was limited by their conſtitutional acts. Both have exerciſed that power which each had a right to exerciſe. The ſtate of war was complete until the preſident made peace; and the ſtate of peace, the true and legal ſtate, until congreſs declared war, which repealed the doings of the preſident.</p>
                     <p>In a treaty of commerce, it is contracted, that duties ſhall be no higher than at preſent. Afterwards congreſs chooſes to impoſe higher duties, and actually does impoſe higher than is ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated in the treaty. The treaty is contravened, and the nation muſt abide the good or evil conſequences that flow from the meaſure, in like manner as it would, if congreſs ſhould chooſe to declare war, and annul an article which declares, there ſhall be a perpetual peace, as is the caſe in ſome treaties. If this conſtruction is right, there can be no limitation, even in terms, of the power of congreſs, eſpecially when it is recollected, that a bare majority of both houſes, with the preſident, is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to paſs a law, while two-thirds of the ſenate is neceſſary to make a treaty. But ſuppoſe any doubt this conſtruction, and in the caſe of an impoſition of higher duties than is ſtipulated by the treaty, the party, conſidering himſelf injured by the law, refuſes to pay; a ſuit is commenced, and the cauſe, in the laſt inſtance, is decided by the ſupreme judicial court, who are authorized to determine whether ſuch an act be, or not, conformable to the conſtitution. If the act of congreſs is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to be unconſtitutional, the treaty could not be called a limitation of the power veſted in them by the conſtitution; ſince it appears that the conſtitution did not veſt in congreſs a power to make ſuch act. Therefore, in no caſe, can the treaty be called a <hi>"a limitation of the power of congreſs, delegated is them by the conſtitution."</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The foregoing has been attempted to obviate the objection of the town as ſtated, and to ſhow that there can, neither in fact nor terms, be any limitation to the powers veſted in congreſs— In the opinion of this writer, there is a ſhort, but equally ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory anſwer to thoſe who fear a real interference in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments of government, from the wording of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. —The people of the United States were well aware, that there were two modes of regulating commerce—one by treaty, where nations are diſpoſed to treat on terms beneficial to each other; the other, where nations are unwilling thus to treat, by laws conſtitutionally made.—Under this impreſſion they framed their conſtitution.—If nations are unwilling to treat with the United States on the rights of commerce, or we are unwilling
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:028389_0527_0FD8EC7A96931550"/>to treat with them, congreſs is the conſtitutional body to make laws, regulating the commerce between them and us.—If na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are willing to treat on their and our commercial relations commercial nations, all of whom will probably regulate our trade by this partial ſtandard."</p>
                     <p>It may be anſwered, that we are under no obligation to make other treaties, becauſe we have made this; and if, in the courſe of two years, from a ceſſation of the war in which Great Britain is now engaged, it ſhould appear to be injurious to us, we can drop all its load of commercial burdens, and embarraſſments.—It might have been well in the town to have ſtated the peculiar embarraſſments the treaty impoſes upon us, and which are to be avoided by its deſtruction. It ſurrenders no rights we now enjoy, but grants ſome we had not before, and renders abſolute what was before precarious. Our other treaties admit us to trade in Europe, as the moſt favored nations. The treaty with Great Britain does the ſame. It alſo admits us into their Eaſt India ſettlements, and their colonies on the continent of North America, to trade with them on terms highly favora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our commerce. No other nation has granted to us like advantages. The treaty with France admits us into certain free ports in the Weſt Indies, under regulations not mentioned in the treaty, but varying according to the will of the ruling power.</p>
                     <p>The laſt reaſon, is, "Becauſe, in the opinion of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this town, the nature and extent of the exports of the United States are ſuch, that in all their ſtipulations with foreign nations, they have it in their power to ſecure a perfect reciprocity of intercourſe, not only with the home dominions of ſuch nations, but with all their colonial dependencies."</p>
                     <p>It is not wonderful, that the town of Boſton ſhould violently oppoſe the treaty, if ſuch be their opinion; but then they ſhould equally wiſh for the annulling of all the exiſting treaties. —Reſtrictions and regulations ſhould be impoſed on all foreign commerce, till thoſe treaties are deſtroyed, or ſuch trade can be obtained. But as the town has not choſen to give their reaſons for this opinion, it is not impoſſible the preſident may truſt to the experience of the United States, from the treaties already made, and his own knowledge of the temper of foreign powers

                     <p>THE firſt number of the Conſtitutionaliſt, in anſwer to the Federaliſt, expreſſes his fears of the danger that may ariſe, from the ſmalleſt branch of the legiſlature poſſeſſing a power to make treaties, independent of the larger. This remark is aimed againſt the conſtitution, that if it has no other effect, it may prepare the mind of the reader for his conſtruction: which, if true, will be a death blow to the treaty, and end all conteſt on account of its expediency. The town, on being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of this, may remain quiet and undiſturbed; for if made by people who have no power, it can never be a law—it, is a mere dead letter.</p>
                     <p>After quoting various paſſages of the conſtitution, which deſcribes the powers of congreſs, he conſiders it as clear, that no treaty can be made, in which the organ authorized, by the conſtitution, to make treaties, ſhall exerciſe any of, thoſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. The conſtitution would, according to this writer, read thus—The preſident, by and with the advice and conſent of the ſenate, ſhall have power to make treaties, provided two thirds of the ſenate concur; and provided always, that ſuch treaties do not relate to peace or war, that they do not regulate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with foreign nations—and that they do not provide for the common defence, and general welfare of the United States.</p>
                     <p>It would be ſtrange, if the people of America had made ſuch a conſtitution, as prevented them from any negociation with foreign powers—on ſuch conſtruction, this would be the caſe. The preſident and ſenate are the only body empowered to make treatin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>; and, according to this reaſoning, their power is ſo reſtrained, that it can never be exerciſed on ſuch ſubjects, as nations treat upon. The mere ſtating the conſequences of ſuch conſtruction, is ſufficient to ſhow its abſurdity; and to convince any reaſonable man, that it originated in no regard to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
                     <p>Does it follow, becauſe the conſtitution veſts a power in two bodies to do an act, that the exerciſe of ſuch power by either will be wrong? If by either, then both—and the power is void. If commerce cannot be regulated by treaty with foreign nations, becauſe a power to regulate commerce is given to congreſs;
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:028389_0529_0FD8EC7D039D7DC8"/>then congreſs cannot regulate commerce, becauſe the preſident and ſenate have power to make treaties, in which is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly included a power to regulate commerce with foreign na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>The people of the United States, as has been elſewhere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, willing to provide for the two common methods of regulating commerce, viz. by legiſlative acts, and by treaties, appointed congreſs to make laws where thoſe were neceſſary; and the preſident, with conſent of the ſenate, to make treaties where that method was attainable, and thought moſt beneficial. The power, veſted in this latter organ of the people, is as full and complete, as that of making laws in the ordinary mode of legiſlation, is in the other.</p>
                     <p>The wiſdom and caution of the people, is, in no inſtance-more ſignally diſplayed than in thus veſting a power to make treaties. Promptitude in ſeizing the fitteſt occaſion, ſecrecy and diſpatch, are often neceſſary in the forming of treaties. Such qualifications are not be found in large bodies. Hence the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of veſting a power of negociation in the preſident. To avoid too great haſte, imprudence, or want of knowledge, which might ariſe from an individual, the people appointed the ſenate (two-thirds of which muſt concur) to weigh and diſcuſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>When it is conſidered, that the ſenate will ever be compoſed of ſome, who have been of that department, nearly ſix year<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, at leaſt, their knowledge of the laws of the United States, of its foreign and domeſtic relations, of the ſtate of its commerce, and what regulations will moſt advance its proſperity, cannot be queſtioned. Theſe qualifications render that body pre-eminently ſit for the duty of adviſing the preſident, in his negociations, with foreign powers. The ſecrecy uſed in ſuch affairs, and which is ſo bitterly exclaimed againſt by this writer, is indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſably neceſſary to the ſafety and proſperity of the people. It avoids the violent oppoſition, which ariſes from the influence and intrigue of foreigners, or of thoſe who prefer the intereſt of a foreign nation to the intereſt of their own. The people appointed the preſident and ſenate to regulate their affairs with foreign nations, and neither directed, nor authorized them to take the advice of any man or body of men. To have commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated their tranſactions while in train, would have been to hazard the intereſt of the people; and ſuch a breach of truſt as to have juſtly expoſed themſelves to the ſevere reprehenſion of thoſe for whom they acted.</p>

Under the confederation, the powers of congreſs were not greater on this ſubject, than thoſe of the preſident and ſenate, under the preſent conſtitution. Congreſs then made treaties of alliance and commerce. The treaties were diſcuſſed, and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in ſecret. If it had been otherwiſe, the peace, happineſs, and independence of the country might have been greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered. Does any one believe, that the court of France would have negociated with our miniſters, if they had ſuppoſed the negociation would inſtantly be made public—and that after a treaty was formed, inſtead of being diſcuſſed in congreſs, it was to combat all the aſſaults of foreign influence in the cities of America?</p>
                     <p>It is highly probable, that had it not been for the <hi>ſecrecy,</hi> as well as the conſummate ſkill and firmneſs of Mr. Jay and Mr. Adams, foreign influence would have prevented the explicit acknowledgment of our independence by Great Britain, and our right to the fiſheries.</p>
                     <p>In the important treaties, negociated and ratified under the confederation, there never was a liſp againſt them, becauſe they were tranſacted in ſecret. The people knew that their rights depended on this mode of conducting ſuch buſineſs; and no one was hardy enough, then, to interfere with the eſſential rights of the people. Let thoſe who clamour at the preſident and ſenate for doing the buſineſs entruſted to them, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner which the experience of all nations, eſpecially of the United States, has ſtamped as alone ſafe and wiſe, ſhow that foreign influence and domeſtic intrigue is leſs to be apprehended now than formerly—that the people's rights will be better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by them, than by thoſe whom the people have choſen.</p>
                     <p>The objection to the treaty, becauſe the preſident and ſenate had no power to make ſuch, will appear ſtill more extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, when it is remembered that the whole ground of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward the commercial reſolutions, by Mr. Madiſon, the winter before laſt—of their recommendation by Mr. Jefferſon, then ſecretary of ſtate, was to induce Great Britain to make a treaty with the United States. The reſolutions were to apply only to nations, who had no commercial treaty with the United States; and they were ſupported againſt Great Britain, becauſe it was ſaid ſhe would make no treaty with us. Both parties then agreed, that if commerce was regulated by treaty, it was out of their power; and the ſupporters of the reſolutions advocated them, on the probability of their forcing Great Britain to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate commerce by treaty. But if they had been bleſt with half the logic of the Conſtitutionaliſt, they would have ſeen that it was wrong and inſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="243" facs="unknown:028389_0531_0FD8EC80156A7F88"/>Mr, Jefferſon to write to Mr. Hammond, demanding "if he was authorized to conclude or negociate arrangements with us, which might ſix the commerce between the two coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, on principles of reciprocal advantage"—in Mr. Jefferſon, to have made "propoſals of friendly arrangement to Great Britain, on the ſubject of commerce"—and becauſe of that government's unwillingneſs to enter into ſuch arrangements with the executive, to have propoſed to congreſs, to commence a ſyſtem of prohibitions, duties and regulations, to produce what he thought might be better done by treaty. The houſe of repreſentatives (whom this writer ſeems to have miſtaken for congreſs, ſpeaking of the ſenate's conſenting to a ratification of the treaty, he ſays, <hi>"aſſumes powers conſtitutionally veſted in the houſe of repreſentatives"</hi>) inſtead of debating whether or not it was the intention of the Britiſh nation, to treat with us on commerce, ſhould have addreſſed the executive on the inſidious conduct of demanding powers from a man, authorizing him to treat, and propoſing to him to negociate on ſubjects, on which they themſelves were not authorized to treat.</p>
                     <p>A particular objection is made to the 6th article of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, becauſe it ſtipulates for the payment of certain Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh debts; to execute which ſtipulation, it will be indiſpenſably neceſſary to lay and collect taxes, duties, impoſts, or exciſes. —It is doubtleſs true, that congreſs muſt lay and collect taxes to make this payment, if the treaty is ratified. The preſident and ſenate have done what they thought juſt and right; and it remains for congreſs to do what is neceſſary on their part, to fulfil the engagements of the United States.—"Congreſs is to pay the debts, and provide for the general welfare of the United States." And no good man can doubt, but that body will do what their duty directs. It is true, congreſs may refuſe to do this—ſo they might refuſe to paſs any laws; but it is not a ſuppoſeable caſe. The conſtitution is framed on the idea that every part of the government will do that, which it is authorized to do for the public good. What is to become of our unhappy fellow citizens in Algiers, if the doctrine advanced here is true? Congreſs cannot make a treaty for their redemption; becauſe congreſs cannot make any treaty. The preſident can make none for their redemption; becauſe he muſt incur a debt to the United States, and to pay that debt, it may be indiſpenſably neceſſary to lay and collect taxes. What a nerveleſs arm do theſe people give to the conſtitution! Under a pretence of ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, they deſtroy the power of the nation, and the liberties of their fellow citizens.</p>

The Conſtitutionaliſt ſays, the Federaliſt was incorrect in his ſtatement of the occurrences of the meeting; but does not even hint in what he was incorrect, unleſs it be in the ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made of the publication of the treaty prior to the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Federaliſt, after ſtating the publication of the treaty, in Boſton, as allowed to be true by the Conſtitutionaliſt, ſays, the foregoing was the only publication of the treaty, prior to the meeting of the inhabitants on the 10th, except a publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its ſuppoſed contents, by ſome one who read it: and which, on compariſon with Mr. Maſon's copy, appears to be incorrect. The Conſtitutionaliſt ſays, "The inhabitants of this town, through the medium of ſeveral newſpapers, had read nearly a counterpart, in ſubſtance, of the treaty, before the arrival of the expreſs from Philadelphia, with Mr. Maſon's copy." The only incorrectneſs, charged againſt the Federaliſt, is, in ſaying, that this counterpart in ſubſtance, as it is called, was incorrect. Some of the reaſons, on which he ſaid this was incorrect, are as follows, viz.—In the 7th article, as ſtated in this counterpart, it ſays, "By this the United States are to refund the value of Engliſh prizes taken in our waters, or by privateers fitted out in our ports." In the copy of Mr. Maſon, it is not ſo. The United States are to refund <hi>only</hi> in ſuch caſes, where they forbore to uſe all the means in their power to obtain reſtitution. In the counterpart, as it is called, 9th article—"The ſubjects and citizens of the contracting parties ſhall hold real eſtate in each others territories, with the ſame advantages as the citizens and ſubjects of the reſpective ſtates." This is groſsly wrong, and well known to have cauſed much of the zeal excited againſt the treaty. In the treaty, the holding of lands is limited merely to thoſe who <hi>now</hi> hold lands, their heirs and aſſigns. In the 13th article of this ſuppoſed counterpart, it is ſaid, that we can carry nothing that we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port from the Eaſt Indies, to any country but the United States, and that we cannot partake of the India carrying trade. This was an article that gave more umbrage to the inhabitants of Boſton than any other.</p>
                     <p>By inſpecting Mr. Maſon's copy, it appears, that the goods exported from Eaſt India are to be carried to America; that we have an expreſs ſtipulation for a direct trade to and from India; that we are perfectly free to export from America, to any part of the world, the goods we import from India; that the coaſting trade, and the trade from India to other parts of the world, reſt on preciſely the ſame ſooting as they did before, except that which is ſtipulated in another article, that they will
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:028389_0533_0FD8EC899AB2AFB0"/>not refuſe to us any privileges in the trade which they may grant to other nations.</p>
                     <p>In this counterpart, it is ſtated, under the 13th article, "As it is difficult to determine the caſes in which proviſions carried to an enemy are contraband; to avoid diſpu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>By an examination of the article in Mr. Maſon's copy, it appears, that proviſions are never to be ſeized, but in caſes where, by the exiſting law of nations, they are contraband, and even then they are paid for. In the one caſe, it was a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt giving up of rights, now enjoyed, of carrying proviſions; while, by the accurate copy, it is a clear and decided advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to our citizens: ſtipulating for payment of freight, profit, and demurrage, in caſes where, by the law of nations, we had forfeited all claim to any thing. Can it be ſaid that the Federaliſt was wrong in ſtating, that this counterpart was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>correct?</p>
                     <p>It is conceded by the Conſtitutionaliſt, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <hi>this counterpart</hi> was what the inhabitants of the town had read and conſulted, previous to their meeting, and that the preparatory ſteps to the town meeting were totally unconnected with Mr. Maſon's copy of the treaty—This confirms what the Federaliſt had ſuggeſted, and ſully accounts for the warmth that was ſo viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble againſt the treaty. If, preparatory to the meeting, the real copy had been read and conſulted on, there is little reaſon to doubt, that a majority of the inhabitants would have been well ſatisfied with it,—The Conſtitutionaliſt need not diſcover his anger, at an imputation, that Mr. Bache excited the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm of the petitioners for the town meeting. It was not even hinted by the Federaliſt. They are perfectly welcome to the whole merit of the thing and to the reputation of their ſpirited reſentment againſt the treaty, before they had reed i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Conſtitutionaliſt ſays, the committee could not know what the two miniſters, while in the act of forming the treaty, brought into conſideration; and, therefore, could not have intended, in the objection, the aſſertion with which the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deraliſt charges them. The Federaliſt did not charge the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee with knowing what the two miniſters brought into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration—He ſays, they aſſumed a fact for which they did not chooſe to give any evidence. He gave in his opinion, that they

                     <p>The Federaliſt then concluded, that the committee meant, by the words, <hi>brought into conſideration,</hi> that they were not the ſubject of negociation; that ſuch is certainly the natural mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the terms; and it was evidently the deſign of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee then; becauſe they go on and ſtate, as objections to the treaty itſelf, their complaints not being provided for; and nobody could be ſo uncandid as to believe, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

We object to the weary, becauſe our complaints have not been conſidered, by which we mean, provided for and allowed; for the Canſtitutionaliſt ſays, the committee did not know what paſſed in the negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; and 2dly, We object to the treaty, becauſe our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints are not provided for and allowed; or elſe the charge is, that the conſideration did not appear in the treaty, that it, that the whole negotiation old not make a part of the treaty—this laſt would be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

In anſwer to an obſervation made by the Federaliſt, that damages for detention of territories were rarely, if ever given, after long and expenſive wars, terminating in favor of the party diſpoſſeſſed; it is ſaid, that ſuch is the magnanimity of conquering nations, that they are willing to take the territory demanded, without inſiſting on any damages. This is a new hiſtory of the politics of nations, as well as the feelings of the human heart. Whether true or not, if ſuch would be the iſſue of a conteſt for the poſts, as ſeems conceded by the Conſtitutionaliſt, it will certainly be conſidered wiſe by the people of America, that the miniſter was willing to take the poſts now, without damages for detention, rather than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve his country in war, to obtain them and damages, when even thoſe, who oppoſe the treaty on this ground, think the iſſue of a war, would, if we were conque<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>THE Federaliſt, in his remarks on the third reaſon of the town, did not mean to ſtate the reaſoning of the Britiſh, on the 7th article of the treaty of 1783, as in his opinion, concluſive againſt the demand of the American miniſter, for the value of negroes embarked from New York, and ſuppoſed formerly to have been the property of Americans. In thoſe obſervations he gave no opinion. The weight of the reply by the Britiſh miniſter, muſt ever depend on its own intrinſic me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit —and every candid American will give to it, all due force. The Federaliſt ſtated, that, under ſuch circumſtances, it was not ſuppoſeable, the Britiſh nation would recede from their conſtruction. If that was to be preſumed, the agent for Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica ought not to have adhered to his, as a point indiſpenfible; becauſe, by breaking off all negociation on that account, be gave up the forts; he gave up all indemnification for our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty captured on the ocean, and alſo the commercial advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of the treaty.</p>
                     <p>The merchants of Maſſachuſetts will conſider, if they are willing to ſurrender all claim to their property captured by the Britiſh—to ſaddle themſelves with an Indian war, at the annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al expenſe of a million of dollars, in a vain attempt, to gain,
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:028389_0536_0FD8EC9530CE9930"/>by force, indemnity for a few ſlaves, once the property of their ſouthern brethren.</p>
                     <p>The Conſtitutionaliſt ſays, "That after a communication of the treaty to the Britiſh general, every ſpecies of the property of the American inhabitants, ought to have been held ſacred; yet, in the ſucceeding month, a large number of negroes did embark for the Britiſh provinces." It may be true, that a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of negroes did embark for the Britiſh provinces; but it by no means follows they were American property.</p>
                     <p>It is agreed, that all the negroes which were embarked, were found in New York, by Sir Guy Carl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ton, and that he arrived there during the war. It is not pretended, that any negroes were taken from their proper maſters, or from any parts of the United States, under the controul of the American government after the receipt of the treaty, by the Britiſh generals. Thoſe negroes were either property, or they were free people. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

It is not diſputed, that the negroes which embarked from New York, were either captured in war, or invited by a proclamation, declaring they ſhould be free on acceptance of the terms therein proffered. Had the ſouthern gentlemen any more right, under the treaty of 1783, to claim negroes of the firſt claſs, than the New England men, their veſſels, or other goods, taken during the war? They were both equally property in the view of a ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>The other claſs was compoſed of ſuch, as induced by the Britiſh proclamation, had left their maſters, and withdrawn themſelves into the Britiſh lines. It will not be denied, that this is a rightful mode of depriving an enemy of property. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had arrived within the Britiſh lines, it will not be contended, that the Britiſh could deliver them up, without a manifeſt breach of faith. They had ceaſed to be American property, as much as a veſſel that had drifted from a port in the United States, into a port of the Britiſh. Had then the ſouthern citizens any more claim for theſe negroes, than the New England men for their veſſels, drifted from their own, into the port of their enemy? The ſame reaſoning applies to both, and appears juſt.</p>

Such has been ſaid to be the reaſoning of the Britiſh miniſter in anſwer to Mr. Jay's repeated applications on this ſubject. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mr. Jay is blamed for not obtaining payment for the negroes, or the ſenate for conſenting to the treaty, though ſilent on this ſubject, thoſe who affect to ſay that the treaty ſhould not be ratified unleſs compenſation is made, ought to give it a ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory anſwer.</p>
                     <p>But it is ſaid, that Sir Guy Carleton was charged by Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Waſhington, with having violated the treaty, in ſuffering the embarkation of negroes; that he acknowledged the truth of the charge, by his precautions in aſcertaining the number, and thereby gave an indirect opinion that reſtitution ſhould be made for them. The mere aſcertaining the number cannot ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port this conſtruction. It is equal evidence, that, in his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no claim for reſtitution could be maintained. Could h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is not preſumeable. Examine the words of his letter; and it will appear that he did not admit the poſſibility of a Britiſh miniſter having made a treaty, that bears ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. They are as follow, viz. "The negroes in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I have already ſaid, I found free when I arrived at New York; I had therefore no right, as I thought, to prevent their going to any part of the world they thought proper.</p>

                     <p>The Conſtitutionaliſt wiſhes to have it believed, that among 3000 negroes, there were none ſick, none ſo young or ſo old, as to be of little value; that they were all prime ſlaves; and that free negroes were ſo enraptured with this land of liberty (where, to be ſure, ſuch people are held as ſlaves) that they would not go with thoſe, who acknowledge them free, and where the laws would protect them with equal ſecurity, as in America; and that, under a military government, thoſe who were really ſlaves, could not be compelled to go with their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per maſters.

                     <p>Of what do the United States complain? of unlawful cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures at ſea; of what did the king of Pruſſia complain? of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful captures at ſea.—The United States and Pruſſia were reſpectively at peace, when the captures were made, and Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain at war.

                     <p>In the treaty of peace made between France and Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in 1783, it is ſtipulated, that the deciſion of the pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>Thus we ſee, that after long and expenſive war<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> by the moſt powerful nations on the globe, this mode of trial and obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compenſation for ſeizures made in time of peace, was conſidered right, and acquieſced in. It is not, therefore, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that after immenſe expenſe of blood and treaſure in a war with England, if ſucceſsful, we ſhould obtain better terms. Is it not wiſe, then, to accept that with peace, which, in the
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:028389_0540_0FD8ECA0CD2D5250"/>moſt proſperous event of a war, would be all we could expect to gain?</p>
                     <p>He attempts to derive force to the reaſon of the town by ſaying that the United States have agreed to a more ſummary mode of trial of the Britiſh claims; and as an equivalent, they ſhould have granted a like mode. A little attention to the cauſes of complaint on the part of the Britiſh, will ſhow, that a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination by commiſſion will only take place, where it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for the ordinary courſe of judicial proceedings to reach the evil.—Firſt, The Britiſh debts due in 1783. The treaty authorizes commiſſioners to take cognizance only of ſuch debts as where, by the operation of various impediments, created by law, Britiſh creditors have been prevented from obtaining juſtice, and where judicial courts connot <hi>now</hi> procure them compenſation. If they can obtain juſtice in the courts of law, they are obliged to reſort there. The commiſſioners cannot ſuſtain their complaints. It eſtabliſhes this ſummary mode to compenſate for loſſes, occaſioned by our not permitting Britiſh creditors to have the advantage of the laws of the land, which was expreſsly ſtipulated in the treaty of peace. For redreſs of our complaints, the courts are open, and what we cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in this way, ſhall be made up to us by commiſſioners. Surely it will not be ſaid, that we have agreed to a more ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary mode of trial for Britiſh complaints, than they have for American complaints.</p>
                     <p>The other ground of complaint on the part of the Britiſh, is in permitting their veſſels to be taken in our ports, or by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateers fitted out in our harbours; and forbearing, for particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reaſons, to make uſe of all the means in our power to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their being captured, or to obtain reſtitution when cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured. It is well remembered what the particular reaſons were—A foreigner, intent on involving our country in a war, and ſupported by an unprincipled faction of Americans, created ſuch a ferment as rendered it hazardous to attempt executing the laws.</p>
                     <p>The government forbore to afford them juſtice in our courts, at that time. It cannot now; thoſe who then inſulted the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of our country are fled, and have taken the property with them—It would be a mockery of juſtice to refer the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh complainants to our courts, when neither their property, nor the perſons who injured them are within our juriſdiction. It will not be pretended that theſe complaints are in a ſimilar ſtate with ours.</p>
                     <p>The Conſtitutionaliſt concedes that the country occupied by Indians within the Britiſh territory, contains, by far, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:028389_0541_0FD8ECA6D6C04F70"/>proportion of furs, but then it is ſaid, that this is not advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous, becauſe the Britiſh traders can ſupply their ſtores from the United States. By his own ſtatement, then, the advantage is double. We can purchaſe largely of furs, and can pay for them by the ſale of goods. Is it diſadvantageous to have a new market open, where we can buy a valuable article, either for our uſe at home, or for exportation to foreign countries? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a market is likewiſe opened, where we may vend many goods imported from Europe and Aſia, at our own prices; for this writer ſays, by reaſon of ice in the St. Lawrence, the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh traders cannot import goods from Europe more than half the year—and will be obliged to ſupply their ſtores from the United States.</p>
                     <p>In the next paragraph he ſays—"They will alſo be able, however extraordinary the grant of this privilege may appear, to import their goods into any port of the United States, and from ſuch Atlantic port tranſport the ſame throughout our whole territory, free of <hi>an alien duty,</hi> upon the ſame terms as our own citizens"—What this writer would intend here cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured—He certainly cannot intend to ſay, that Britiſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects can import goods into the Atlantic ports of the United States, at leſs duties than they did before the treaty—If he does he intends to deceive his readers—There is not a word in the treaty that gives ſuch right—Goods imported into the Atlantic ports by Britiſh ſubjects are liable to the ſame duties before and after the ratification of the treaty. If they ſhould chooſe to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port all their goods into the Atlantic ports of the United States, and pay us duties, and tranſport them through our territories, what would be the injury to us? None—We ſhould be great gainers. And no ſenſible man could ever ſuppoſe any other than beneficial conſequences, if all the Britiſh colonies were to be ſupplied through the United States.</p>
                     <p>In the next ſentence, the note is entirely changed, and it is there aſſerted, "that Britiſh traders have ſuch large capitals and ſuch connexions with the Indians; and Americans have ſuch ſmall capitals and without ſuch connexions, that the article can be of no advantage to the Americans." His only meaning here can be, that we can neither have a market for importation or exportation. He is requeſted to reconcile the contradiction between this and the former part of the paragraph; where he gives us to underſtand that the Britiſh traders muſt be ſupplied from the United States, becauſe they cannot import more than half the year by ſea. He ſays, "Aſiatic goods under the treaty cannot be afforded on better terms, by American citizens, than by Britiſh ſubjects; becauſe the Britiſh government reſerves
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:028389_0542_0FD8ECAA8DDC7640"/>to itſelf the right of impoſing on American veſſels entering into the Britiſh ports in Europe, a t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nnage duty equal to that which ſhall be payable by Britiſh veſſels in the ports of America; and alſo ſuch duty as may be adequate to countervail the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of duty now payable on the importation of European and Aſiatic goods, imported into the United States, in Britiſh or American veſſels." The Conſtitutionaliſt is deſired to point out how this article can poſſibly produce the conſequences he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts, or what relation it has to this ſubject. We import our Aſiatic goods, direct from Aſia. We do not import them from any Britiſh ports in Europe.</p>
                     <p>It has not been denied, that Aſiatic goods are a third cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the United States than in England, whence the coloniſts muſt get them, unleſs they import them from America. How then can it be ſaid, with or without this wonderful reaſon, which, with equal aptneſs, might be applied to increaſe the clamour on the negro buſineſs, that Aſiatic goods cannot be afforded on better terms, by American citizens, than by Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh ſubjects? He goes on to ſay, "that more is required than the naked aſſertion of the Federaliſt, to prove, that the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican citizens will be able to import the goods, that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by the Indians, into the United States, upon better terms than Britiſh ſubjects can import the like merchandizes into the Britiſh provinces." It is true, and the knowledge of every reflecting man is what ſupports the aſſertion; but, leſt the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of the Federaliſt ſhould not be believed, for the reaſons given by him, the Conſtitutionaliſt endeavours to confirm it, by telling us, that the Britiſh traders will have an advantage in buying of us, rather than importing by the river St. Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; that the Britiſh can even import into the Atlantic ports of the United States, and thence tranſport by land into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior of their own country, on better terms than they can into their own ports.</p>
                     <p>This writer aſſerts, "that the Britiſh ſubjects could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our ports as freely before the treaty as they may in caſe of its ratification, for they were before ſubject to an alien duty, which will be completely ſuſpended by its ratification." The aſſertion of the Federaliſt was, "they, ſpeaking of the Britiſh, enter our ſea-ports as freely now as they can by treaty." This is true; and the Conſtitutionaliſt is deſired to ſhow a word in the treaty, that leſſens the duty now paid, by Britiſh ſubjects, in our ſea-ports.</p>
                     <p>After allowing that the traffic with the Indians is within the Britiſh territories, he remarks, that "juſt removing her poſts, over the line of interſection, between the two territories, by
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:028389_0543_0FD8ECAC086B5988"/>which means her ſettlers and trading houſes, will remain an inſurmountable barrier to the traffic of our citizens with the Indians within the Britiſh territories." By treaty we have a right to go into <hi>all their territories,</hi> by land, or inland navigation, not merely to their poſts. Pray then, Mr. Conſtitutionaliſt, tell us how her ſettlers and trading houſes will be an inſurmountable barrier to this trade?</p>
                     <p>The fur trade, he ſays, will not be worth a pepper corn, Mr. Jefferſon ſays, "delaying to ſurrender us the poſts cuts us off from the fur trade, which, before the war, had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways of <hi>great importance, as a branch of commerce,</hi> and as a ſource of remittance, for the payment of our debts to Great Britain." Mr. Madiſon ſtated the fur trade, withheld by the poſts, worth 200,000 dollars per annum.—But the article, which admits us into a fur trade, ſix times greater, to ſay the leaſt, than that derived from a mere ſurrender of the poſts, this advocate of the committee calls a mere pepper corn!!</p>
                     <p>The 15th article of the treaty is brought forward as an objection of immenſe weight againſt the treaty. Let us ſee how it ſtands. It is acknowledged, that Britiſh veſſels now pay an higher duty in American ports, than American veſſels pay in Britiſh ports. The parties ſtipulate to treat for the more exact equalization of duties, within two years after the preſent war, and agree that, in the interval, the difference now ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhall not be increaſed. This is, in its nature, a very tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary arrangement; and, without an expreſs ſtipulation, hardly any language can be more ſtrong, that Great Britain will not raiſe her duties. She muſt equally raiſe them on all other nations, if ſhe does on us; and their duties have remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame for many years.</p>
                     <p>He aſks the Federaliſt, whether any ſuch article exiſts in our other treaties. The anſwer is, no. The reaſon is, becauſe, at making thoſe treaties, no ſuch difference ſubſiſted, and there was no national government authorized to impoſe duties. And further, let it be remarked, that this article is equally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to the other powers, with whom we have ſtipulated not to impoſe higher duties, than thoſe paid by the moſt favored nations. The horrible event, therefore, of offending our allies, need not be apprehended from this article.</p>
                     <p>The Conſtitutionaliſt allows, that all the aſſertions made by the Federaliſt, reſpecting the right of nations having colonies, are true; and obſerves, that there are but few, in this enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened country, who are ſo ignorant as not to know, that unleſs we gain a right by treaty, Great Britain may prohibit our trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or even entering the ports of her colonial poſſeſſions,
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:028389_0544_0FD8ECB217A01880"/>without affording us any juſt cauſe of complaint. Every admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, then, of American veſſels into her colonies muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered a grant in our favor, of certain acknowledged rights.</p>
                     <p>It is unneceſſary to remark, that by the confeſſion of this writer, he, and thoſe whoſe cauſe he attempts to advocate, complain of the article ceding us certain rights in the Eaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, without any juſt cauſe of complaint. Having an abſolute right, according to the Conſtitutionaliſt, to deny us all trade, the permiſſion of even a partial commerce muſt be conſidered an advantage gained by the treaty.</p>
                     <p>The Conſtitutionaliſt is requeſted to point to any thing that we give in exchange for this important trade to the Eaſt Indies. Here is the ceſſion of a right which it is acknowledged Great Britain was under no obligation to grant, for which in return we have granted nothing; but they ſay the treaty wants a reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procation of benefits from Britain to America.</p>
                     <p>The Federaliſt expreſſed no admiration, nor even an opinion of the writings of Lord Sheffield; he only quoted his words: he has frequently quoted the Conſtitutionaliſt—By the ſame rule it may be concluded, he admires the writings under this ſignature—to draw ſuch concluſions from ſuch premiſes, is a ſpecies of logic yet unknown to the Federaliſt—he forbears any further remarks—he writes merely with a view of pointing to the truth—to lead men to think and act for themſelves.</p>
                     <p>The Conſtitutionaliſt, after having fully and completely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the rights of Britain to an excluſive trade with her colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and abſolute want of a right in us to trade there, unleſs ceded by treaty, has the wiſdom to contend that we ought not to receive any by ſtipulation; and that the treaty ought not to be ratified becauſe of an article which gives us a valuable trade to her colonies.</p>
                     <p>But then he implies that a trade to the Eaſt Indies will not be ſubſtantially beneficial, becauſe, in his opinion, on compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon with its preſent advantages, it will not be equally ſo as now. This may be offered as a ſample of logic—it is certainly neither truth nor common ſenſe, to ſay that a thing cannot be ſubſtantially, or poſitively good, becauſe it has been better.</p>
                     <p>Goods are uſually ſold cheaper in Oſtend than here—proof offered—they are <hi>ſometimes</hi> imported from that country to this. India goods are <hi>ſometimes</hi> imported from England into America; therefore, they are cheaper there, than here. They are <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times</hi> imported from France into America. According to ſuch reaſoning, it would not be difficult to prove that almoſt every article of commerce is cheaper in every part of the world, with which we trade, than in America. Do merchants never ſend
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:028389_0545_0FD8ECB391059AE0"/>goods from one port to another, but when they are dearer in the place ſent to, than in the place ſent from? This would be to ſuppoſe certain knowledge in a merchant of the different markets, in diſtant quarters of the world, not only of times paſt and preſent, but of future times. This would be a kind of preſcience extremely valuable, but not yet attained. Do mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants never ſend goods to a port for a remittance, becauſe they are cheaper in the place ſent to than the place ſent from? The Conſtitutionaliſt ſays, goods ſent from America to the Eaſt Indies, are generally ſold at a loſs.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſe, for a moment, that the reaſon given ſupports his aſſertion, what has it to do with our trade to Aſia? The true queſtion by a merchant would be, where can I procure Aſiatic goods on the cheapeſt and beſt terms? If in Oſtend, rather than in India, it will be better to import ſuch goods from Oſtend than India. But until it can be ſhown, that India goods can be imported on better terms from Europe, after the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants have added their profits, than from Aſia, it is probable the trade will continue, and be conſidered a beneficial one, although they are <hi>ſometimes</hi> imported from Oſtend.</p>
                     <p>This reaſon, though it came out modeſtly in the firſt part of the paragraph, in the latter part is made to prove that not only our trade to India will in future not be beneficial, but that we might obtain our India goods in Oſtend cheaper than in Aſia. What a pity, that this reaſoning had not been brought to the public eye, before this late hour. The merchants of Salem and Boſton had more than thirty veſſels, chiefly ſhips, in the year 1793, amounting to more than five thouſand tons, ſtupidly purſuing a voyage of fifteen months, at three times the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe that it would have coſt them to have obtained the ſame profits from Oſtend, in five months, according to this writer —for the charge of five per cent. to procure bonds exiſts no where but in his imagination. There is not a word in the treaty rendering bonds neceſſary. The increaſe of twenty per cent. likewiſe, which he has conjured up, has no other foundation. The words of the treaty are, "neither is this article to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued to allow the citizens of the ſaid ſtates to ſettle or reſide within the ſaid territories, or to go into the interior parts thereof, without the permiſſion of the Britiſh government eſtabliſhed there; and if any tranſgreſſion ſhould be attempted againſt the regulations of the Britiſh government in this reſpect, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of the ſame ſhall and may be enforced againſt the citizens of America, in the ſame manner as againſt Britiſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects or others tranſgreſſing the ſame rule." It cannot be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any who read this part of the article, that we have the
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:028389_0546_0FD8ECB5570F61A0"/>ſame right after as before the ratification of the treaty; and a candid man would have thought, that putting our citizens on exactly the ſame footing as their own, would have reſcued this part of it, at leaſt, from cenſure; eſpecially when we conſider the immenſe expenſe Great Britain incurs for ſecuring this trade to her own ſubjects. It is yet poſſible that the merchants will continue to rely more on their own calculations, than this ſublime logic of the ſchools.</p>
                     <p>The Conſtitutionaliſt agrees that Great Britain may prohibit us from all trade in her Eaſt India ſettlements, without juſt cauſe of complaint on our part—That ſhe has ſtipulated to grant that which we could not claim of right, and which ſhe has not ſtipulated to grant to any other nation—That having ſtipulated to grant us certain rights, does not impair her power to permit us the exerciſe of others—That our rights by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion will be as ſtrong after, as before a ratification of the treaty—Yet he concludes that we are expreſsly prohibited by treaty from all trade not abſolutely granted. This appears to be a palpable contradiction in the Conſtitutionaliſt—He may, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, conſole himſelf by ſetting down this remark as a ſelf-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent propoſition—He ſays, "America had certainly a right to expect the ſame indulgences would have been ſecured to her citizens in their intercourſe to the Britiſh ſettlements in India, as are enjoyed by other nations." (<hi>Indulgences</hi>—Strange that this writer would uſe ſuch a term as applying to us from Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.) Let it be remarked in anſwer to this obſervation; that other nations have no <hi>indulgences ſecured to them.</hi> Further, Great Britain cannot prohibit us any indulgences without prohibiting them to other nations, according to the 15th arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the treaty, wherein it is ſaid, "Nor ſhall any prohibition be impoſed on the exportation or importation of any articles, to or from the territories of the two parties reſpectively, which ſhall not equally extend to all other nations."</p>
                     <p>He ſays that "Britiſh veſſels by the treaty, receive from us indulgences, which are not allowed even to our allies." This is not true—It cannot be ſupported by a word in the Britiſh treaty. And the treaty between us and France, expreſsly ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, that her ſubjects ſhall enjoy and receive every right and immunity that other nations do or <hi>ſhall</hi> enjoy.</p>
                     <p>The Conſtitutionaliſt ſupports the 8th reaſon of the town, by aſking, whether in other treaties, there is any ſtipulation that we will export goods directly from India to America.— The anſwer is, there is not; and the reaſon is obvious. No other nation has permitted us by treaty, to go to India. There is no reſtriction of a trade there, in our treaties with other
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:028389_0547_0FD8ECBA677B73D0"/>powers, becauſe they do not allow us to trade there at all. This may be put down in the claſs of ſelf-evident propoſitions.

This is an article which appeals ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly to our ſenſe of juſtice for its fitneſs, that objections to it could not have been thought poſſible; and it cannot eſcape the notice of the moſt curſory obſerver, that all who attempt to ſupport their objections, conſtantly aſſume premiſes, or draw concluſions ſo apparently falſe, as to convince their readers of the very reverſe of what they intended.</p>

                        </gap>es the colony ſyſtem in our favor, more than Great Britain has ever done to any other nation, and more than any other nation has ever done to the United States—which trade, by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the Conſtitutionaliſt, ſhe might have withheld without any juſt cauſe of complaint on our part; that the twenty-eighth article ſecures to our citizens payment for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, in caſes where, by the exiſting law of nations, ſuch proviſions would have been juſtly forfeited. It is not denied, that this is the natural and obvious conſtruction of the article; indeed words could not have made this plainer. What then can be the motives of writers who ſee and confeſs this to be the true ſenſe of the terms; and, at the ſame time, aſſert that "by
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:028389_0548_0FD8ECBE090FFDF8"/>this ſtipulation the United States ſurrender to Great Britain the right never before reſtricted, to ſend certain articles to France, and even legalize her arbitrary ſeizure of them." Do they think that a falſehood, becauſe it is repeated, can be palmed on the public for truth? Or do they think becauſe they frequently tell of their love for the people, and their reſpect for an <hi>enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened public,</hi> that they can thus inſult their underſtanding, at the expenſe of truth and common ſenſe?</p>
                     <p>The ninth article is conſidered as extremely injurious—and the Conſtitutionaliſt has been pleaſed to remark that Britiſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects now hold vaſt tracts of land in the United States, in fee ſimple, and that American citizens now hold a few rods of land in the Britiſh dominions, in <hi>fee tail</hi> only. Whence this writer aſſumed this fact is not known—It is believed to exiſt only in his own imagination.</p>
                     <p>Among the artifices attempted to impoſe on the public, none have been more induſtriouſly uſed, than that of exciting an idea in the people, that their lands were to be holden by Britiſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and that this article would even deprive them of their own ſoil.—The moſt ridiculous falſehoods have been circulated in converſation, and in the public papers; ſuch as have ſhown the utmoſt contempt for the underſtandings of our fellow citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, with a view of frightening weak and childiſh minds. The words of the article merely extend to lands <hi>now holden.</hi> It gives a Britiſh ſubject no right to buy real eſtate; he cannot acquire lands by purchaſe under this article. It contains no other right than is in the treaty of peace; with this addition, that they who now hold lands may convey them by deviſe or otherwiſe— Whereas by a rigid conſtruction of the article in the treaty of peace, and the law reſpecting a right to hold lands by aliens, the beſt ſubjects could only hold lands during their lives, and if a deſcent was caſt before a conveyance, the lands became eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheated to the government.</p>
                     <p>Until the laſt ſeſſion of congreſs, any alien, being a free white perſon, who had reſided two years in the United States, and one year in any particular ſtate, and could give ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory proof to any court of record, that he was a perſon of good character, on taking an oath to ſupport the conſtitution of the United States, might become a citizen of the United States. This naturalized not only the alien, but alſo all his children un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der twenty one years of age. Thus cheap and eaſy was the mode not only of acquiring a right to hold lands, but of moſt of all the rights that could in any caſe appertain to a citizen.</p>
                     <p>The ſtate of Georgia the laſt winter, ſold many millions acres of land, and in their deeds of ceſſion enacted, that if
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:028389_0549_0FD8ECBFE13B4360"/>aliens purchaſed, they ſhould hold the ſame, with all the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges that could appertain to them, if citizens. In the month of May, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In our treaty with France, Frenchmen are expreſsly authorized to hold lands. After ſuch an expreſſion of the ſenſe of the people, on the ſubject of aliens holding lands, it cannot be preſumed, that it is in the power of the moſt ranting madman to impoſe a belief on the weakeſt, that a clauſe in the treaty which permits Britiſh ſubjects to retain and convey the lands they now hold, can be of the ſmalleſt evil.</p>

The quotation from Vattel, reſpecting the manner in which republics treat with monarchs, is fully agreed by the Federaliſt —and the character of our envoy, long ſince eſtabliſhed in the grateful remembrance of his countrymen, would not ſuffer a doubt in the mind of any man, that this equality of republics would be fully vindicated by him. The treaty of commerce, which is the ſubject of diſcuſſion, has only added another proof of his ability, in vindicating the rights of republics. In the treaty of peace, which he, with his compatriots, ſo ably nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated at Paris, he gave the fulleſt evidence of his ſkill and power in treating on equal terms with royal governments, though oppoſed by an inſidious ally, and deceitful court. At that time the ſame men, who now attempt to deſtroy his well earned fame, would have proſtrated the republic of America at the feet of a royal court, now acknowledged to be the moſt corrupt and perfidious in Europe. The firmneſs and abilities of Mr. Adams, the vice-preſident, and Mr. Jay, ſaved our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try from the diſgrace.</p>
                     <p>The ſuggeſtion that the Federaliſt can be offended by the eſtabliſhment of a doctrine like that mentioned by Vattel, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites no other emotions in his breaſt than thoſe of contempt.</p>
                     <p>From the eſtabliſhment of the federal conſtitution to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent moment, there has been a party in the United States, which with unceaſing and active malignancy has oppoſed the freeſt republic on earth—This party, nevertheleſs, boaſts of its repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licaniſm.</p>
                     <p>The Conſtitutionaliſt in his fifth number, in vindication of the 11th reaſon of the town, and in oppoſition to the treaty, becauſe it expreſsly ſtipulates, that in caſe of war, debts, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther public nor private, ſhall be confiſcated, ſeems to concede that credit has been of great efficacy in producing the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our country; and that, in the laſt war, nothing was gained by a ſequeſtration of debts—conſiders ſuch truths as irrevelant to the ſubject. Surely if the people are ſatisfied, that credit has produced and is producing the moſt conſpicuous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to this country, they will avoid every thing that tends to impair credit, for by leſſening that, they will aſſuredly leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen their advantages.—If, in the laſt war, they eſſayed this method of deriving benefit, and found it unſucceſsful, they will call for complete proof of its ſuppoſed advantages, before they attempt it again. The queſtion he makes, is—Has the United States a right, by the law of nations, to confiſcate ſuch debts? He aſſerts that they have, and to prove the aſſertion, quotes Vattel; but either overlooked a very material part of a paragraph, reſpecting private debts, or for ſome purpoſe, did
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:028389_0551_0FD8ECC612CEA2E0"/>not chooſe to bring it into view. Immediately following his firſt quotations, and between that and his laſt quotation, are theſe words—"But at preſent, in regard to the advantage and ſafety of commerce, all the ſovereigns of Europe, have departed from this rigour; and as this cuſtom has been generally receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he who ſhould act contrary to it, would injure the public faith; for ſtrangers truſted his ſubjects only, from a firm per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, that the general cuſtom would be obſerved." Vattel is here ſpeaking of debts, due from individuals of one nation to thoſe of another; and this is the writer quoted by the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutionaliſt, to ſupport the right of confiſcating private debts. Which are we moſt to admire at, the weakneſs of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee's advocate, or his audacity in thus attempting to impoſe on the public?</p>
                     <p>If we had occaſion to remark on the meanneſs and falſity of conduct in excluding an intermediate paſſage that ſo completely deſtroyed a doctrine the Conſtitutionaliſt was labouring to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, we can feel nothing but contempt for a writer who inſults the public underſtanding, by making the following quotation, viz.—"A ſtate at war, does not ſo much as touch the ſums which it owes to the enemy. Every where, in caſe of a war, funds credited to the public, are exempt from confiſcation and ſeizure." And then aſſerts, that he has demonſtrated, that "a right to ſequeſter or confiſcate monies in the public ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nds, does exiſt according to the law of nature and nations."</p>
                     <p>The Conſtitutionaliſt ſays, "the ſituation of European nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, might have led them to this cuſtom, but they have not recognized the ſame by any national compacts or treaties." The word cuſtom, as quoted from Vattel, referred to private debts, as any one may ſee, who will turn to Vattel, 3d book, chap. 5th, ſect. 77.</p>
                     <p>The Conſtitutionaliſt, with his uſual diſpoſition to pervert the truth, applies it to the laſt quotation from Vattel, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects monies credited to the public. The Conſtitutionaliſt fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſerts, in ſpeaking of a right to confiſcate debts generally, "the exerciſe of this right, has never yet been reſtricted by treaty. It has, by common conſent, reſted entirely with the wiſdom and humanity of nations."</p>
                     <p>Theſe aſſertions of the Conſtitutionaliſt, are abſolutely untrue, There is ſcarcely a treaty made in the laſt century between any of the European nations, but what reſtricts the right to confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate debts, and recognizes the doctrine, as laid down by Vat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, to have originated from cuſtom. In the treaty between Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia and Great Britain, 12th article, it is ſtipulated, "that if the peace ſhould come to be broke, the perſons, ſhips, and
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:028389_0552_0FD8ECC70D8BD988"/>commodities, ſhall not be detained, or confiſcated; but they ſhall be allowed, at leaſt, the ſpace of one year, to ſell, diſpoſe, or carry off their effects;—and they ſhall farther be permitted, either at or before their departure, to conſign the effects which they ſhall not as yet have diſpoſed of, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o ſuch perſons as they ſhall think proper, in order to diſpoſe of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hem as they deſire, and for their benefit; which debts the debtors ſhall be obliged to pay in the ſame manner as if no ſuch rupture had happened." In the treaty made between Spain and Great Britain, in the year 1667, is the following article; "if a war ſhall happen, the reſpective ſubjects and people ſhall have notice thereof, given them in time, viz.—ſix months to tranſport their merchandize and effects, without giving them in that time, any moleſtation or trouble, or retaining or embarraſſing their goods or perſons." In the treaty between Great Britain and Portugal, concluded in 1642, the 18th article is as follows; "in caſe of difference, two years are allowed on both ſides, to tranſport their merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes and goods, and, in the mean time, there ſhall be no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury or prejudice, done to any perſon or goods, on either ſide." In the treaty between Ruſſia and Denmark, 35th article, it is ſtipulated, "merchants ſhall have a year to depart, may ſell, part with, or remove their effects, and thoſe who owe them money, ſhall be obliged to pay their debts, equally as if no rupture had happened." In the treaty made between France and Great Britain, in the year 1786, it is agreed, in the 2d ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, "that if at any time there ſhould ariſe any miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, breach of friendſhip, or rupture between the crowns of their majeſties, the ſubjects of each of the two parties, reſiding in the dominions of the other, ſhall have the privilege of remaining and continuing their trade therein, without any manner of diſturbance, ſo long as they behave peaceably, &amp;c. &amp;c. and in caſe their conduct ſhould render them ſuſpected, and the reſpective governments ſhould be obliged to order them to remove, the term of twelve months ſhall be allowed them for that purpoſe, in order that they may remove with their effects and property, whether intruſted to individuals or to the ſtate."</p>
                     <p>The 20th article of our treaty with France, the 3d of that with the United Netherlands, and the 23d with that with the king of Pruſſia, reſtrict the exerciſe of this right which the Conſtitutionaliſt ſays, never has yet been reſtricted by treaty. —What confidence can be placed in a writer, who makes ſuch falſe aſſertions, to induce the people to adopt principles which are exploded by all the civilized world; and which, even the barbarians of Algiers have abandoned, as too diſgraceful for their character?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="265" facs="unknown:028389_0553_0FD8ECC9D5C643B8"/>
After a review of the aſſertions of the Conſtitutionaliſt, in his 5th number, none can wonder at his attempts to ridicule morality, and his exclamations at what he is pleaſed to call a ſaint-like zeal againſt injuſtice.</p>
                     <p>After all, the public cannot avoid the concluſion, that wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters like the Conſtitutionaliſt, who object to the treaty, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the article reſpecting the confiſcation of debts, are guilty of the groſſeſt affectation. For no one can ſuppoſe, from the diſplay they are pleaſed to make of their own princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that any reſtriction by treaty would bind them to reſpect the rights it contracted for.</p>

                  <p>OUR commerce in Europe, hath been of late carried on chiefly in our own ſhipping, which accounts, in part, for their wonderful augmentation in number and ſize. Part of our commerce to Europe is, in fact, an indirect Weſt India trade; the jealous policy of Spain, having led her to ſhut her Weſt Indies to all nations, we have, with ſome exceptions, been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the univerſal prohibition: but, on the other hand, wanting our ſupplies, ſhe takes them at Cadiz, St. Andero, Ferrol, &amp;c. and tranſports the flour from thence, in her own ſhips, to the Havanna, Curracoa, &amp;c. Even this is a much better footing for us than Britain propoſes in the 70 tons article; becauſe it gives our ſhipping a freight to Europe, in common times, of one to one and an half dollar per barrel, forming an immenſe object of profit to the United States; which, indeed, augments the price to the Spaniſh planter in the Weſt Indies; but is not otherwiſe injurious to us than as it hampers and makes circuitous the intercourſe with our neighbours, and ſhows a ſtrange conduct in the government, whoſe ſubjects muſt eat ſtale and dear flour by this circuitous channel, when they might have it ſo much cheaper and freſher, direct. Our chief trade in Europe with Spain, therefore, conſiſts in a ſale of flour for her Weſt Indies, which we are chiefly paid for in ſpecie, or bills on London of equal value, remitted in payment for manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures we take from Britain. With the Italian ſtates we have but little intercourſe: they produce grain and rice in abundance, uſually, themſelves: tobacco and fiſh are the only articles we could ſell to advantage there; but for this we muſt wait, not till the nations of Europe make peace, but till we can make peace with Algiers and Morocco, which, I ſuppoſe, will hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen

                  <p>THIS accompanies the proceedings of a very conſiderable number of the citizens of the United States, convened in the city of Savannah, for the purpoſe of taking into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration

                  <p>To a people who feel for their country, and have its welfare at heart, it muſt be a very unpleaſant taſk to complain of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic meaſures; but whatever painful ſenſation it may excite, it is a duty they owe to themſelves and poſterity to notice any act militating againſt their rights and intereſts. In this light we have viewed the treaty; and under that impreſſion have ſtated our objections, which we hope will appear to be well founded.</p>
                  <p>We feel a confidence, ſir, that in laying our grievances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, they will be attended to; and that the man who was ſo inſtrumental in eſtabliſhing our rights and liberties, will not take any ſtep to impair them.</p>
                  <p>In giving our opinions on ſo momentous a ſubject, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that we have expreſſed the ſentiments of a large majority of the citizens of this as well as of the other ſtates. Should this be the caſe, we doubt not but you will meet the wiſhes of your country, by withholding your ſignature from a treaty, which, if ratified, will be productive of the moſt ruinous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences to the United States.</p>

                  <p>RESOLVED, That the citizens now aſſembled have the undoubted right, at all times, to expreſs their opinions publicly, on <hi>every</hi> meaſure of government, and that on none can it more behove them, than on the propoſal of a treaty with any foreign power, as a treaty is not conſtitutionally a ſubject of diſcuſſion in the houſe of the people's immediate repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives.</p>

                  <p>Becauſe it has let the ſubjects of this hoſtile and treacher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous government into a participation of our right to navigate the Miſſiſſippi, and has thereby diſpelled every hope of obtaining an amicable adjuſtment of our differences with Spain on that ſubject.</p>

Becauſe Jay has dared to cede, and that to Britiſh ſubjects, a part of the American ſoil, and has, moreover, ſubmitted the bounds of ſuch ceſſion, to the diſcretion of the Britiſh king.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe the whole of the Britiſh debts, with intereſt, are ſaddled, ultimately, on the whole people of the United States; a thing not ever aſked for, or expected by the moſt griping cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe it has waved all claim for the value of the negroes plundered and carried off in violation of the treaty of 1783, to the total ruin of many of the owners.</p>
                  <p>But laſtly and principally, becauſe this government is and has long been totally deſtitute of that, without which, treaties become only plots and robberies, FAITH. Her <hi>magnanimity</hi> ſhows itſelf, through the Indian's tomahawk and ſcalping knife; her friendſhip in the Algerine cruiſers; and her truth, honeſty, and juſtice, in violating the treaty of 1783, in detaining the poſts, in her commercial regulations, and in her late robberies of the American veſſels.</p>
                  <p>The alliance of ſuch a corrupt, degenerate, and ſinking govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ought religiouſly to be avoided by the American people.</p>

                     <pb n="271" facs="unknown:028389_0559_0FD8ECD7944583A0"/>
Actuated neither by party ſpirit, prejudice nor malevolence; uninfluenced by the proceedings of the unwiſe and intemperate; ſtrangers to intrigue, but (we hope) fortified againſt it; we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare our ſentiments of our preſent political ſituation to the world.</p>
                  <p>At a time when another nation is ſtruggling to ſecure liberty, it becomes us to be watchful of our own. Nineteen years have now elapſed ſince the independence of our country was declared; our blood, our treaſure, and the lives of many of our friends and fellow citizens, were ſacrificed to purchaſe it. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that we ſhould be unjuſt to our lives, and traitors to our country, to remain ſilent when inſidious attempts are made to wreſt from us our deareſt privileges. As a portion of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple we feel as they do, and our intereſts are inſeparable. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts have been made to vilify the people, by traducing the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular ſocieties, loading them with ſlander, contumely, with every epithet of reproach, and repreſenting them as enemies to their country, and diſturbers of the public peace; theſe "ſelf-created ſocieties," the organs of the public mind, the guardians of the rights of the people, like to the hundred eyes of Argus in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting illicit intrigues, will be dreaded, deſpiſed, or cenſured, by none but the <hi>guilty</hi> and <hi>baſe.</hi> An honeſt man, whether in the humble paths of private life, or in public national truſt, need never be afraid of the ſtricteſt ſcrutiny.—The deſigns of the traitor as of the private aſſaſſin, may be known only to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: but overt actions ſpeak for themſelves. When the baſe deſigns and conduct of <hi>men in authority</hi> are ſo glaring, it is a duty, which every man owes to his country, to come forward to declare his ſentiments and expoſe ſuch as have abuſed their power and perverted their truſt. Such are the principles and ſuch has been the conduct of Mr. Jay, as appears from his former opinions, and late conduct as envoy; by his principles, always favorable to the unjuſt claims of our former enemy, and by his conduct attempting to undermine the liberties of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low citizens, to load them with unmerited obloquy, and to raiſe up this monſter of ariſtocracy, the enemy of mankind, and the ſcourge of nations. We are ſorry that we have not been diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in our expectation of Mr. Jay's negociation; but we are deceived in the object of his miſſion: we were told that he was ſent to demand the delivery of the weſtern poſts and compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation for our domeſtics, carried away by the Britiſh plunderers, as the former treaty of peace gave us a right to demand; we were told that he was inſtructed to demand ſatisfaction for the depredations committed on our merchant veſſels and goods, on the high ſeas; but we were never told, that he had any inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:028389_0560_0FD8ECDA629B67D0"/>to form a treaty, inſulting to our national honor, prejudicial to our domeſtic happineſs, and injurious to our rights and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, as citizens of a free nation. The event, however, has juſtified our opinion of the envoy, and our expectation of his negociation.</p>
                  <p>Reſolved, therefore, That feeling indignant at the many at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts made by ſome of our men in truſt againſt the exerciſe of our rights in endeavouring to bring us under the tyrannical inſolence of Great Britain, we will co-operate with our fellow citizens, on every juſt and lawful occaſion, in oppoſing and counteracting every attempt to degrade the citizens of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.—That although peace is the greateſt of all bleſſings, yet war, with all its attendant horrors, is to be preferred rather than to accept of it at ſuch diſgraceful and diſhonorable terms as are held forth to us in ſaid treaty.</p>
                  <p>Reſolved, That we conſider this treaty as militating againſt the principles of our conſtitution, as ſubjecting the commerce of this country to Britain—as a ſurrender of the power of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs to form commercial regulations; and in particular as hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile to the people of France, with whom we ought to be on the terms of friendſhip, if we were under no obligations of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and if we had not been bound by a former treaty with that nation.</p>
                  <p>Reſolved, That in the preſent ſituation of this country, we conceive treaties with any foreign power, not only unneceſſary, but impolitic, and eſpecially with Great Britain, who has not fulfilled the former treaty of peace, and whoſe faith cannot be depended on.</p>
                  <p>Reſolved, That our fellow citizen Charles Pinckney, has our warmeſt thanks, for his noble, manly, and ſpirited ſpeech<note n="*" place="bottom">See Vol. 1. page 5.</note> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered at the meeting in the city of Charleſton, on the 22d of July, and printed in the City Gazette of the 4th inſtant.</p>

                  <p>The committee, to whom their fellow citizens referred the conſideration of the treaty, ſigned at London, on the 19th of November, 1794, between his Britannic majeſty and the United States, called a treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port—That they have inveſtigated the ſame, as time and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances would permit, and are of opinion, that it cannot be the baſis of amity and friendſhip; becauſe, on the one ſide, it is arrogant and dictatorial, and, on the other, puſillanimous and ſubmiſſive.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, reſolved, That it is the opinion of the citizens of Laurens county, in the ſtate of South Carolina, that the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, among the other objections, ought, of right, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct its ratification.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="274" facs="unknown:028389_0562_0FD8ECDF52D89D90"/>
1. The preamble is an open declaration, that the merits of the complaints and pretenſions of the contracting parties ſhall not be taken into conſideration.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The 1ſt article of the treaty abrogates laws of the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſtates, and makes proviſion for the return of perſons who were baniſhed only for crimes of the deepeſt dye, a ſight of whom will open the wounds which time had kindly cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trized.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The 2d article has done, for the enemies of the United States, what neither a ſeven years war, nor eleven years peace could accompliſh; it gives them protection in our boſom, while they continue to demonſtrate the moſt inveterate hatred, both againſt our citizens and government. It procraſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates the evacuation of poſts held by Britiſh forces within our boundaries, which, by right and ſound policy, ought to have preceded all negociation. It even holds that up as a <hi>favor granted,</hi> which the United States ought to have demanded as their right. —Beſides, the United States make a ceſſion, the limits of which to them are unknown, as his majeſty may (for ought they know) have granted to the above deſcribed perſons, all the lands within their precincts or juriſdiction, and which, by this treaty, the United States guarantee to them the quiet poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The 3d article is not only altogether partial in favor of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, but authorizes an intercourſe between the ſubjects of his Britannic majeſty and the Indians within the territories of the United States, which will be a conſtant ſource of irritation and diſturbance, and may finally lead the United States into a war, not only with the Indians, but the Britiſh themſelves, which this treaty ought to have made proviſion againſt.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. By the 6th article, the United States undertake to make good ſuch loſſes on debts to Britiſh creditors as have been occaſioned by legal impediments, when no ſuch impediments have exiſted in any of the ſtates that did not equally apply to citizens of the ſame; and becauſe no indemnification is made to the citizens of the United States, for property taken from them at the cloſe of the war, the reſtitution of which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for by the treaty of 1783.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We think the 7th article, as it reſpects the injured citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of the United States, altogether illuſory, and calculated only to deceive, while the United States are bound to make good the damage (not done by our citizens, but) committed by other nations on our coaſts.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The 9th article gives to aliens ſome of the precious rights of citizens, while they continue without the controul
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:028389_0563_0FD8ECE09B195120"/>of the federal and ſtate governments; which we think both unjuſt and impolitic.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The 10th article cedes what the United States moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitably ought to retain; and more eſpecally ſo reſpecting Britain, the whole of whoſe conduct towards the United States and citizens thereof, has been limited by the want of power more completely to diſtreſs us. By this article, the United States cede the only poſſible preſent means of reſtraining that wanton nation in her unbounded inſults, which ſhe has (ſince firſt capable) offered to all nations. It is alſo an undue reſtraint on the powers of congreſs, conſtitutionally committed to them by the people of the United States, and ought never to be abridged by treaty.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. By the 12th article, the United States obtain his majeſty's <hi>conſent</hi> to ſupply his ſubjects in the Weſt Indies with the prime articles of life; and even that, in the firſt inſtance, in a moſt cramped manner, and ſubject to ſuch regulations, in future, as the Britiſh government ſhall think fit to impoſe; for which ideal favor, the United States have ceded a moſt lucrative branch of the carrying trade, and agreed to give Britiſh ſhips a preference in our own ports, in tranſporting all Weſt India goods, and even cotton, the produce of our own ſtates. As this article is temporary, it declares that, before its expiration, the contracting parties will endeavor further to regulate the ſaid trade, as the then ſituation of his majeſty may require, without mentioning the ſituation of the United States. It alſo poſtpones the conſideration, whether neutral veſſels ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect enemy's property, until after the cloſe of the preſent war, during which time, America being at peace, ought to have been her great harveſt.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. The 17th article is a formal acknowledgment, that Britain is the legitimate legiſlator of the marine world; that the orders of her admiralty ſhall be conſidered as the law of nations. This unequivocal declaration of what ſhall be right, in future, will, doubtleſs, have weight in determining what is paſt, and not only preclude the recovery of our moſt equitable demands, for unheard-of (in the hiſtory of any civilized nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) depredations made on our commerce, but alſo lead our allies to diſtruſt our fidelity, by which our citizens may loſe their property, and the United States their allies.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. The 18th article is a ſacrifice of American commerce to Britiſh intereſt.—Our produce, of almoſt every kind, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traband in time of war (which, for the laſt hundred years, has, with Britain, been three of war to four of peace) during which, in future, Britain has only to declare the world in a
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:028389_0564_0FD8ECE3917227F0"/>ſtate of blockade, and the United States muſt trade with her, or no where.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. The 20th and 21ſt articles create doubts, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction the Britiſh mean, in future, to give to the word Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. —Should an American be robbed of his property, by a Britiſh privateer or ſhip of war, on the high ſeas, would he be permitted to expatriate himſelf and take a commiſſion under ſome power at war with his Britannic majeſty, in order to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſals! or, if he did, might he not, by this treaty, be taken, tried, and ſuffer as a pirate, when he is purſuing the only mode in his power, in order to obtain reſtitution for unme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited injuries, and which his country, by this treaty, has refuſed to redreſs?</p>
                  <p>If he may be thus taken and ſuffer, we think it unjuſt, while the barbarous practice of privateering is carried on to ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard-of lengths by that wanton nation: at the ſame time, the United States allowing, nay, even compelling perſons emigrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this country to expatriate themſelves, before they can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come citizens of theſe ſtates.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. In the 23d article, his Britannic majeſty pretends to grant, as a favor, what the moſt barbarous nations ſeldom refuſe, viz. giving aid in diſtreſs.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. The 24th and 25th articles have a direct tendency to lead our allies to doubt, whether we are not inimical to them and their cauſe, which (as it reſpects the people) is not true, however it may be with the government.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon, reſolved, That it is the opinion of the citizens of this county, that, if the ſaid treaty ſhould be ratified, the United States, ſo far as it reſpects their commercial ſituation, are far worſe than colonial.</p>
                  <p>Reſolved, That the thanks of the citizens of this county be given to the ten patriotic ſenators, who voted againſt the ratification of the ſaid treaty, in the ſenate of the United States.</p>
                  <p>Reſolved, That the thanks of the citizens of this county be given to S. T. Maſon, one of the ſenators from Virginia, for his firmneſs in publiſhing the treaty, ſo long kept ſecret from the good citizens of theſe ſtates, by which means they are made ſenſible of their dangerous ſituation, and enabled to expreſs their diſapprobation thereof.</p>
                  <p>Reſolved, That it is the opinion of the citizens of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that the ſaid treaty has a general tendency to miſlead the people, and to reſtrict the legiſlative powers of congreſs, and is a moſt flagrant violation of the federal conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="277" facs="unknown:028389_0565_0FD8ECE5068835F0"/>
Reſolved, That the citizens of this county do approve of the proceedings of the citizens of Charleſton, in their addreſs to the preſident of the United States, requeſting him not to ratify the ſaid treaty.</p>
                  <p>Reſolved, That a copy of the foregoing proceedings, atteſted by the chairman, be immediately tranſmitted to the honorable John Mathews, Eſquire, chairman of the citizens of Charleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and that he be requeſted to notify the ſame to the preſident of the United States.</p>
                  <p>On motion of the citizens of this county, reſolved, That thanks be given to the ſelect committee of the ſame, for their care and firmneſs with regard to the treaty.</p>
                  <p>Reſolved, That the addreſs to Major Butler, preſented by the committee, be adopted, and a copy thereof ſent to him.</p>

                  <p>YOUR fortitude excites our admiration, your virtue, our eſteem, and your attention to our intereſt, our gratitude. Be aſſured your oppoſition, in the federal ſenate, to the ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the treaty, ſigned at London on the 19th of Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, 1794, has our fulleſt approbation, and merits, our warmeſt applauſe and firmeſt ſupport. We, ſir, have examined it with care, and anxiouſly ſought that reciprocity which is ſo artfully held up as the baſis of friendſhip; but, to our great ſurpriſe, only find it cautiouſly worded, and wonderfully calculated to deceive the good citizens of theſe ſtates, by holding up phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms as though they had exiſtence, and repreſenting <hi>ideal</hi> as though they were <hi>real</hi> advantages. We conceive it altogether illuſory, as to any ſenſible or poſſible good that can reſult to the United States as a government, or the citizens thereof as individuals. We are ſorry to ſay, that in this treaty, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold our conſtitution violated, our commerce bartered for illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, our allies juſtly led to diſtruſt us, and we ourſelves made the ſport of caprice and Britiſh polities.

We lament there were no more, yet we rejoice there were ſo many, in the ſenate, who ſpoke the language and acted the will of the people. This is but a tribute due to patriotiſm, and we rejoice, ſir, to pay it to you. While natives forge the language and ſentiments of free-born citizens of theſe ſtates, what do we behold! A man not by chance of birth an American, but one by <hi>reaſon</hi> and by choice, who is more firmly attached to the federal government, and the dignity thereof, that even its indigenous ſons. Our hope, ſir, is, that you will ſtand faſt in virtue, be firm and true to the rights of the people; then will we not fail to do you juſtice as you paſs through life; nor ſhall hiſtory record thoſe virtuous acts but with eclat, and ſay to poſterity, <hi>This man, this</hi> SENATOR, <hi>deſerved well of his country.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">I. IT begets a baſe and unnatural political connexion between a republican government and a monarchy.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. It ſacrifices to that connexion, paſt injuries, a reparation for wrongs, and the moſt eſſential intereſts of commerce, that an independent nation can yield.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. It proſtrates the conſtitution of the United States, at the feet of the preſident and ſenate, rendering that fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal charter of our rights any thing or nothing, as the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and ſenate ſhall, in their diſcretion, by treaty determine.</p>

IV. It declares war againſt the independent and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional rights of congreſs, by attempting to take away their power to decide on any queſtion ſimilar to thoſe propoſed in the ſeſſion of congreſs before the laſt, by Meſſrs. Madiſon, Dayton, and Clarke: viz.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Mr. Madiſon's, for reſtricting the commerce with Great Britain.</item>
                     <item>2. Mr. Dayton's, for ſequeſtering Britiſh property.</item>
                     <item>3. Mr. Clarke's, for ſuſpending the commercial intercourſe with Great Britain.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="5">V. It enlarges the ground of this warfare, by attempting to diveſt congreſs of the power</p>
                  <p>To regulate trade and intercourſe with the Indian tribes;</p>
                  <p>To levy and collect duties of impoſt and exciſe;</p>
                  <p>To define and puniſh piracies on the high ſeas, and offences againſt the law of nations;</p>
                  <p>To grant letters of marque and repriſal;</p>
                  <p>To declare war—</p>
                  <p>An which powers are, by the conſtitution of the United States, expreſsly veſted in congreſs.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. It ſeeks to maintain this warfare, by arraying the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and ſenate, ſupported by Great Britain, on one ſide, againſt the repreſentatives of the people, their conſtituents, and the conſtitution of the United States, on the other ſide; thus introducing foreign intrigue and influence into our public councils and domeſtic politics, and engendering cauſes of diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, diſunion, and intrigue.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. It inſidiouſly aims to diſſolve all connexion between the United States and France, and to ſubſtitute a monarchic, for a republican ally; virtually, if not expreſsly, violating our neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality, in the following inſtances:—
<list>
                        <item>1. By admitting and legalizing ſeizures for adjudication, in all caſes of ſuſpicion of having on board enemy's property, or of carrying to the enemy, articles which are contraband of war.</item>
                        <item>2. By declaring to be contraband "all timber for ſhip-build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, tar or roſin, copper in ſheets, ſails, hemp and cordage, and, generally, whatever may ſerve directly for the equipment of veſſels."—ALTHOUGH GREAT BRITAIN, IN HER COMMERCIAL TREATY WITH FRANCE, HAD HER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SELF DECLARED THOSE VERY ARTICLES NOT TO BE CONTRABAND.</item>
                        <item>3. By admitting ſeizures of veſſels laden with proviſions, in all caſes, under the frivolous pretext of "difficulty of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:028389_0568_0FD8BEA1A57F1B18"/>on the preciſe caſes, in which alone, proviſions and other articles not generally contraband, may be regarded as ſuch."</item>
                        <item>4. By placing Great Britain on the footing of the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored nation, and ſtipulating "That no prohibition ſhall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on the exportation or importation of any articles, to or from the territories of the two parties, reſpectively, which ſhall not extend to all other nations."</item>
                        <item>5. By bettering the condition of Great Britain, pending the war with France; thereby increaſing her reſources, and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling her to proſecute and continue the war with that republic.</item>

                  <p n="8">VIII. It records and perpetuates the diſhonor of America, and the political depravity of her government; exhibiting the ſad ſpectacle of the United States, ſervilely cringing to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt monarchy of Great Britain, for a cloſe and intimate alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, at the ſacrifice of the moſt eſſential political and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial intereſts; whilſt, pointing the finger of hoſtility to France, it ſeeks, in the hour of her difficulty and diſtreſs, to wound that magnanimous republic, which was no leſs the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of American emancipation from Britiſh tyranny and oppreſſion, than ſhe is now the guarantee of that independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which we have thus ſo ſhamefully abuſed, by negociating the preſent inglorious and diſgraceful treaty.</p>

                  <p>THAT I deny; for it muſt be a new thing to all the world to read the ſentiments of the preſident of the United States, who know that he is the ſame identical man who was, during the late American war, the commander in chief of the American army.</p>
                  <p>As a ſmall proof—in his late anſwer to the merchants and traders in the city of Philadelphia, who approved of the treaty, he has the following very extraordinary expreſſion: "Such ſentiments, deliberately formed, and proceeding from men whoſe intereſts are <hi>more immediately concerned</hi> than thoſe of any other claſs of citizens."</p>
                  <p>Has the adulation, which has been poured upon him, from all quarters, for theſe twenty years paſt, ſo bewildered his ſenſes, that, relinquiſhing even common decency, he tells 408

                  <p>A treaty which children cannot read without diſcovering that it tends to diſunite us from our preſent ally, and unite us to a government which we abhor, deteſt, and deſpiſe.</p>
                  <p>A government, which, in compliance with his ſentiments, often expreſſed in the moſt energetic terms, when he was our worthy commander in chief, our children were learned to liſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Has that government altered its ſyſtem of arrogance and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm? Or has he altered his ſentiments of freedom?</p>
                  <p>That it continues the ſame, is certain; that the is greatly changed, I moſt firmly believe.</p>
                  <p>Should this conduct produce a ſerious rupture amongſt our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (which God forbid) how many of theſe 408 would court the honor of being his body guard, provided he ſhould think proper to expoſe himſelf to danger?</p>

                  <p>Does his anſwer to them, in point of complaiſance and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs, <hi>though they conſiſt of ſeveral thouſands,</hi> bear any analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy to that tranſmitted to the 408 merchants and traders?—Who, I hope, to prevent miſtakes, will for ever hereafter be diſtinguiſhed by the <hi>ſignificant</hi> title of, "<hi>The preſident's</hi> 408 <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable friends in the city of Philadelphia.</hi>"</p>
                  <p>And, that their real reſpectability may be more fully verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I moſt ſincerely hope, further, that their abſolute occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—the yearly amount of their dealings—their political ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents

                  <p>At his own table (it was an expreſſion made uſe of for the public ear, or it would not now be revealed by me) I have heard him obſerve, in an hour of his own and of his country's moſt extreme diſtreſs, that "the people of the United States ought to be particularly thankful to a kind Providence, through whoſe conſpicuous bounty, George Clinton had been appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed governor of the ſtate of New York;" and yet this very Mr. Clinton, if I am not very much miſinformed, is as unſhaken an opponent to the treaty, as any man in the United States.</p>
                  <p>Let me aſk, on the other hand, who are the moſt numerous, the only conſolidated claſs of inhabitants (for many of them are not citizens) who ſpeak in favor of it?</p>
                  <p>The anſwer fluſhes on my mind quick as lightning: every m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But, gracious heaven, what a change has this deleterious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument effected? Not a man of that deſcription now, who does not ſpeak of the preſident as of an angel from heaven, and of the treaty, as a gift of the firſt magnitude, procured through his divine influence, as the only remedy againſt the errors of republicaniſm, and the influence of the rabble!</p>
                  <p>Thoſe men, too, while they are the warmeſt friends of the preſident, are the moſt inveterate enemies of a Clinton, a Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferſon, a Burr, a Madiſon, and all others who embrace, or even countenance their ſentiments and opinions.</p>
                  <p>Reflection, on this uncommon inſtance of human inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, leads me to a very weighty queſtion, which I moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly entreat the preſident to anſwer to himſelf, having firſt ſeriouſly conſidered the unexampled change both of his friends and oppoſers, from Georgia to New Hampſhire: It is this; Have your old friends deſerted you? Or have you deſerted what was formerly yours, and ſtill is their favorite cauſe, "The rights of man?"</p>

This queſtion comes not from an anarchiſt, but from one who loved, admired, reſpected, revered, and almoſt adored, General Waſhington, and who has received the written thanks of that great man, for his exertions in that cauſe, of which his beloved commander in chief was then the great defender.</p>
                  <p>Gratitude and reſpect for the virtuous conduct of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer general will never be obliterated from his mind; and a due obedience to his preſent preſident ſhall be punctually paid, as long as the love of his country, and a determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to preſerve its conſtitution unimpaired, can poſſibly admit.</p>

                     <p>The committee, appointed by the town, to conſider the treaty entered into by Mr. Jay with the government of Great Britain, beg leave to report as follows:</p>
                     <p>Philoſophy and reaſon have, at laſt, to the honor and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of mankind, decided queſtions long obſcured by ignorance, and conteſted by deſpotiſm. They have eſtabliſhed on grounds, never again to be ſhaken, the <hi>equal rights</hi> of mankind, the <hi>ſovereignty</hi> of the people, the <hi>reſponſibility</hi> of the magiſtrates, and the <hi>rights</hi> of every citizen, freely to diſcuſs, and freely to give his opinion on, all public meaſures and public men.</p>

                        <pb n="284" facs="unknown:028389_0572_0FD8ECFB94FA7BC0"/>
This right may be more important in its operation, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be diminiſhed, by the numbers aſſociated to exerciſe it— whether the aſſociation be <hi>ſelf-created,</hi> or grounded on the imperious authority of thoſe who are only the <hi>ſervants</hi> of the public.</p>
                     <p>The inhabitants of the town of Plymouth, ſtrongly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with the above ſentiments, ſo congenial to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in the American revolution—alarmed by the ruinous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and tendency of the treaty, lately negociated by Mr. Jay, with the king of Great Britain, have thought it their duty, on this occaſion, to aſſemble in town-meeting, to give their marked and decided reprobation of the ſaid treaty, in all its parts.</p>
                     <p>The numerous objections to this treaty have been ſo fully detailed, ſo forcibly ſtated, and ſo concluſively deduced from its ſeveral parts, by many very reſpectable meetings of citizens, as not only to preclude the neceſſity, but propriety, of a repetition. We, therefore, forbear the diſagreeable taſk of delineating the picture of a buſineſs, ſuſpicious in its origin—dark and inſidious in its progreſs—without reciprocity, the only baſis of treaties—without policy—without gratitude to our beſt friends—violating the conſtitution of the United States, and proſtrating the American character at the ſhrine of Britiſh arrogance, with no object, apparent to us, but to embarraſs and diſtreſs the republic of France, and to break down the republican ſyſtem of this country.</p>
                     <p>Before we conclude the buſineſs of the meeting, our duty impels us to the more pleaſing taſk of expreſſing our reſpect and gratitude to the ten ſenators of the minority, whoſe patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otiſm formed an honorable oppoſition: and particularly to one of them, who drew from ſecrecy and darkneſs, and expoſed to the public vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We place our hopes and confidence in divine providence, ſo often and ſo ſignally interpoſed in favor of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, and, under that, in the virtue and patriotiſm of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the United States, to relieve our apprehenſions, by their adopting ſuch meaſures, as ſhall effectually ſecure us againſt the impending dangers and diſtreſſes of the treaty with Great Britain.</p>

                  <head>Waſhington Reſolutions.</head>
                  <head type="sub">At a Meeting of the Citizens, Inhabitants of <hi>Waſhington</hi> Diſtrict, in the State of <hi>South Carolina,</hi> the Treaty of Amity, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and Navigation, between his Britannic Majeſty, and the United States of America, concluded at London, on the 19th Day of November, <hi>1794</hi>—was taken into Conſideration, when the following Reſolutions, expreſſive of their Sentiments on the Subject, were entered into.</head>
                  <p>RESOLVED, That although an undue, and over-jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy of public officers is often, in its conſequences, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politic; yet freemen always have the right, and in many caſes it becomes their abſolute duty, to exerciſe that right, of enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fully, and with freedom, into the meaſures and conduct of the ſervants of the public. On this occaſion, the magnitude of the preſent ſubject of deliberation, and the ruinous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of Mr. Jay's treaty, if finally ratified, to the trade, agriculture, and various intereſts of the United States of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, induce us to join our other fellow citizens in oppoſing a ſyſtem founded on inequality, and on principles of themſelves, as to one party, unequal and unjuſt; and we will, in expreſſing this our diſapprobation, point out a few of the many injuries that America would feel from the operation of the ſaid treaty.</p>
                  <p>Reſolved, That the reſtriction on American veſſels trading to the Weſt Indies, to 70 tons, and all remittances of Weſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia produce made in them confined to American markets only; and the prohibiting cotton to be exported from America, unleſs in Britiſh bottoms, though the product of our own country, and now becoming a valuable and increaſing ſtaple in South Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina and Georgia, whilſt Britiſh veſſels of any tonnage, with or without excepted articles, are allowed to trade to any port or place they pleaſe; is a manifeſt injuſtice to America, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grading to her as a nation, having neither equivalent nor reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procity on her ſide, and ought, therefore, to be diſcarded as incompatible with her honor and intereſt as a ſovereign and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent government.</p>
                  <p>Reſolved, That the board or court of judicature, eſtabliſhed by the 6th article of the treaty, is highly dangerous; as the mode of procedure and the kind of teſtimony to be admitted, are in the breaſts of the judges only, and are not to be confined to any of the known rules of law or equity. Add to this, a majority of the judges may be Britiſh ſubjects, who will be deciding between the United States and their fellow ſubjects, for
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:028389_0574_0FD8ED00D6192A60"/>unknown and large ſums of money, thereby exerciſing an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and unlimited power over the funds of the United States, contrary to the conſtitution and againſt the ſafety of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                  <p>Reſolved, That it is impolitic and unjuſt for the United States to oblige themſelves to make good the defalcations of the debts of the Britiſh creditors in America, for a ſuppoſed infrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the treaty of 1783, when no ſatisfaction is made by the Britiſh government to America, for the injury done her by the detention of the poſts, or for the thouſands of negroes car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off from her citizens in direct violation of that treaty.</p>
                  <p>Reſolved, That the apparent equal right of the parties mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to ſettle, and carry on trade, on the eaſtern banks of the Miſſiſſippi, is ill founded and fallacious; as the Britiſh, long ſince, had ceded to the Spaniſh government all claims of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory they had on the ſaid river to the ſouth of the 31ſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of north latitude, the now ſouth boundary of the United States; and to the north up the ſaid river, they themſelves think they have no claim, otherwiſe their plenipotentiary, Mr. Grenville, would not have ſuppoſed that a line running due weſt from the lake of the Woods would paſs above the ſource of that river, and on that ſuppoſition had an article put in their treaty with us, appointing commiſſioners to aſcertain and fix that part of the boundary: therefore, the allowing Britiſh ſubjects to make ſettlements and eſtabliſh factories, if they chooſe, on the banks of the ſaid river, is giving them privileges they have no colour of right to, and that without an equivalent on our part: a privilege, which, in the event, from their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of trade and influence among the numerous tribes of Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, might endanger the peace of the United States. Alſo, we conceive the right given by treaty to both parties to uſe in common the bays, rivers, creeks, ports, harbours, &amp;c. is une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, and leaves theſe ſtates without a ſufficient equivalent for the advantages they give up—for whilſt a Britiſh ſubject has a right to paſs, ſettle and trade, where and how he pleaſes in any part of the United States, a citizen of America is prohibited from trading, or even going into the limits of the territory of the Hudſon's Bay company, the only part of his Britannic ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's poſſeſſions in North America, where it would be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to have the privilege, as nearly the whole of the fur trade with the northern tribes of Indians paſſes through that channel.</p>
                  <p>Reſolved, That in all the commercial parts of the treaty, the Britiſh have greatly the advantage; and although the appearance of reciprocity is kept up, yet, on inveſtigation it will be found
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:028389_0575_0FD8ED0555737098"/>that the United States would enjoy the ſhadow only, and not the ſubſtance of almoſt any one equal advantage.</p>
                  <p>Reſolved, That in our opinion, the preſident of the United States would act worthy his uniform great and good character, by refuſing to ſign the ſaid treaty.</p>
                  <p>Reſolved, That the ſenſe of the people, who did not attend our meeting, be taken at the enſuing reviews, which are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered at five different places, of the five regiments of this bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade, compoſed of Waſhington diſtrict, and the reſult, being properly certified, be publiſhed in the City Gazette.</p>

                  <p>Upon this principle, the following Petition to the General Aſſembly of Virginia, in virtue of their conſtituti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

It is preſumed, that the time, previous to the meeting of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, is too ſhort to afford that general circulation of the petition throughout the ſtate, which is deſirable: but it is hoped, that ſuch patriotic citizens, as may approve its contents, will be active in favoring their fellow citizens with an opportunity of teſtifying, in like manner, their approbation, by their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſubſcriptions thereto.</p>

Through theſe means, one more effort may be made, by a declaration of the public ſentiment, to prevent the final ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and ultimate energy of an inſtrument, which is deemed fatal to the intereſts, the happineſs, and perhaps, finally, to the liberty and independence of the United States.</p>

Even "waving the merits of the reſpective complaints and pretenſions of the two parties," as to the inexecution of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of peace, it is reaſonable to view the two parties as equally culpable, or equally blameleſs, and to determine that the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:028389_0581_0FD8ED1395ACF340"/>of the treaty of peace equally by both ought to have been provided for. Yet, whilſt the United States are to comply, in the moſt ample manner, with the article unfulfilled by them, and to make compenſation for whatever loſſes may have accrued from their delay; Great Britain is releaſed altogether, from one of the articles unfulfilled by her, and is not obliged to make the ſmalleſt compenſation for the damages which have accrued from her delay, in fulfilling the other.</p>
                  <p>Theſe equitable and reciprocal claims of the United States are not even allowed the chance of arbitration.</p>
                  <p>This inequality of terms, is greatly aggravated by other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, on the part of the United States, which, beſides adding to the violation of the conſtitution, artfully introduced in this treaty, may, in a great meaſure, defeat the good conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of a ſurrender of the weſtern poſts, if that article of the treaty ſhould be faithfully executed by Great Britain.</p>

                  <p>Thus American veſſels bound to Great Britain, are protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſea papers, againſt French and Dutch ſearches; but when bound to France or Holland, are left expoſed to Britiſh ſearches, without regard to ſuch papers.</p>

                  <p>Britiſh property, in American veſſels, is not ſubject to French or Dutch confiſcation—French or Dutch property in American veſſels, is ſubjected to Britiſh confiſcation.

                  <p>The article prohibiting confiſcations and ſequeſtrations, is unequal between Great Britain and the United States; Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can citizens have little, if any, intereſt in private or bank ſtock, or private debts, within Great Britain. So, where much would be in the power of the United States, and little in the power of Great Britain, the power is interdicted: Where more is in the power of Great Britain than of the United States, the power is unconfined. Another remark is applicable—When the modern uſage of nations is in favor of Great Britain, the modern uſage is the rule of the treaty; but when the modern uſage is in favor of the United States, the modern uſage is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, as a rule for the treaty.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. The footing on which the treaty places the ſubject of commerce, is liable to inſuperable objections. 1. The nature of our exports and imports, compared with thoſe of other countries, and particularly of Great Britain, has been thought, by the legiſlature of the United States, to juſtify certain dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, in the tonnage and other duties, in favor of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can bottoms; and the advantage poſſeſſed by Great Britain, in her ſuperior capital, was thought, at the ſame time, to require ſuch countervailing encouragements. Experience has ſhown the ſolidity of both theſe conſiderations. The American na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028389_0586_0FD8ED21CAE25C98"/>has, in a good degree, been protected, againſt the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage on the ſide of Britiſh capital, and has increaſed in proportion; whilſt the nature of our exports, being generally neceſſaries, or raw materials, and our imports conſiſting moſtly of Britiſh manufactures, has reſtrained the diſpoſition of Great Britain to counteract the protecting duties afforded to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation. If the treaty is carried into effect, this protection is relinquiſhed, and congreſs are prohibited from ſubſtituting any other. Then the Britiſh capital, having no longer the preſent inducement to make uſe of American bottoms, may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, in whatever hands operating, to give the preference to Britiſh bottoms.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The proviſions of the treaty, which relate to the Weſt Indies, where the nature of our exports and imports gives a commanding energy to our juſt pretenſions, inſtead of allevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating the general evil, are a detail of particular humiliations and ſacrifices. Nor will a remedy by any means be found, in a reviſion of that part alone of the treaty.</p>
                  <p>If Great Britain ſhould accede to the propoſition of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                        <desc>••••</desc>
                     </gap>, and the treaty be finally eſtabliſhed, without that part of it, but in all its other parts: She will, in that event, be able to exclude American bottoms altogether from the channel of intercourſe, and to regulate the whole trade with the Weſt Indies, in the manner heretofore complained of, whilſt the United States will be completely diſpoſſeſſed of the right and the means of counteracting monopoly, unleſs they ſubmit to an univerſal infraction of their trade, not excepting with nations whoſe regulations may be reciprocal and ſatisfactory.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The treaty, not content with theſe injuries to the United States, in their commerce with Great Britain, provides, in the 15th article, againſt the improvement or preſervation of their commerce with other nations, by any beneficial treaties that may be attainable.—The general rule of the United States, in their treaties, ſounded on the example of other nations, has been, that where a nation is to have the privileges of the moſt favored nations, it ſhall be admitted gratuitouſly to ſuch privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges only as may be gratuitouſly granted, but ſhall pay, for privileges not gratuitouſly granted, the compenſation paid by others; this prudent and equitable qualification of the footing of the moſt favored nation, was particularly requiſite in a treaty with Great Britain, whoſe commercial ſyſtem, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to other countries, being matured and ſettled, is not likely to be varied by grants of new privileges that might reſult to the United States. It was peculiarly requiſite, at the preſent juncture, alſo, when an advantageous reviſion of the treaty

                  <p>The propoſed treaty, nevertheleſs, puts Great Britain, in all reſpects, gratuitouſly, on the footing of the nations moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored, even as to the future privileges, for which the moſt valuable conſiderations may be given; ſo that it is not only out of the power of the United States to grant any peculiar privileges to any other nation, as an equivalent for peculiar advantages in commerce or navigation, granted to the United States; but every nation, deſiring to treat on this ſubject with the United States, is reduced to the alternative, either of declining the treaty altogether, or of including Great Britain, gratuitouſly, in all the privileges it purchaſes for itſelf. An article of this import is the greateſt obſtruction, next to an abſolute prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, that could have been thrown in the way of other trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and that it was inſidiouſly meant by Great Britain to be ſuch, is rendered the leſs doubtful, by the kindred features of the treaty.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It can be no apology for the commercial diſadvantages, that better terms could not be obtained. <hi>If proper terms could not be obtained, at that time, commercial articles, which were no wiſe eſſentially connected with the objects of the embaſſy, ought to have waited for a more favorable ſeaſon.</hi> Nor is a better apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy to be drawn from our other treaties. Theſe not only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>id many of the ſacrifices in the new treaty; but the chief of them were the guarantees or the auxiliaries of our indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and, in that view, would have been an equivalent for greater commercial conceſſions than were inſiſted on.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. The preſident and ſenate, by ratifying this treaty, uſurp the power of regulating commerce, of making rules with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to aliens, of eſtabliſhing tribunals of juſtice, and of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining piracy. A formal demonſtration of every part of this complex propoſition is not requiſite. We will prove, that this treaty is dangerous to liberty, and that the conſtituted autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, who have given it their ſanction, have flagrantly vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated their duty, by an appeal to the conſtitution itſelf, to that explicit inſtrument, which we formed as the unerring guide of our repreſentatives, but which ſome of them have dared to violate.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. A treaty, thus incompatible with our conſtitution, thus unequal in its conditions, thus derogating from our national rights, thus inſidious in ſome of its objects, and thus alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all its operations, is not only unworthy of the voluntary
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028389_0588_0FD8ED2646E9DDF0"/>acceptance of an independent and happy people, but is an abject ſacrifice, which ought to have been rejected with diſdain, in the moſt humiliating and adverſe circumſtances. It is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely believed, that ſuch a treaty would not have been liſtened to at any former period, even when Great Britain was moſt powerful, and the United States moſt feeble. <hi>To pretend, that, however objectionable the inſtrument may be, it ought to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as the only eſcape from a hoſtile reſentment of Great Britain, which would evidently be as impolitic, as it would be unjuſt on her part,</hi> IS AN ARTIFICE TOO CONTEMPTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLE TO ANSWER ITS PURPOSE. It will not eaſily be ſuppoſed, that a refuſal to part with our rights, without equivalents, will be made the pretext of war on us; much leſs that ſuch a pretext will be founded on our refuſal, to mingle a ſacrifice of our commerce and navigation, with an adjuſtment of political differences. Neither is there any evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in hiſtory, or in human nature, that nations are to be bribed out of the ſpirit of encroachment and aggreſſion, by humiliations, which nouriſh their pride, or by unreaſonable conceſſions, which extend their reſources and their power.

Can the Federaliſt, can Curtius, can Camillus, deny that this is a more heinous violation of the law of nations, and a more deep and laſting injury, than the ſequeſtration or even confiſcation of an equal value of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty within the territory of the piratical nation?—Surely, if they have the audacity to deny it, they will find few of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened citizens of America to coincide in opinion with them.</p>

                     <p>Commerce, it is manifeſt, like any other object of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize or induſtry, will proſper in proportion as it is ſecure.

Its free exerciſe would deſtroy external commerce; or, which is nearly the ſame thing, reduce it within the contracted limits of a game of hazard, where the chance of large profits, accompanied with the great riſks, would tempt alone the adventurous and the deſperate. Thoſe enterpriſes, which, from circuitous or long voyages, ſlowneſs of ſales, incident to the nature of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain commodities, the neceſſity of credit, or from other cauſes, demand conſiderable time for their completion, muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028389_0593_0FD8ED3589C3F830"/>Credit, indeed, muſt be baniſhed from all the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of foreign commerce; an engine, the importance of which, to its vigorous and ſucceſsful proſecution, will be doubted by none, who will be guided by experience or obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                     <p>It cannot need amplification, to elucidate the truth of theſe poſitions. The ſtorms of war occur ſo ſuddenly and ſo often, us to forbid the ſuppoſition, that the merchants of one coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try would truſt their property, to any extent, or for any dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in another country, which was in the practice of confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating or ſequeſtering the effects of its enemies, found within in territories, at the commencement of a war. That practice, therefore, would neceſſarily paralize and wither the commerce of the country in which it obtained. Accordingly, nations at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to the cultivation of commerce, which Formerly were betrayed, by temporary conſiderations, the particular inſtances of that atrocious practice, have been led, by the experience of its miſchiefs, to abſtain from it in later times. They ſaw that to have perſiſted in it would have been to abandon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition on equal terms, in the lucrative and beneficial field of commerce.</p>
                     <p>It is no anſwer to this, to ſay that the exerciſe of the right might be ordinarily ſuſpended, though the right itſelf wight be maintained, for extraordinary and great emergencies.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place, as the ordinary for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> depoſites, that would not otherwiſe have taken place; a depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure from the general courſe would always involve an act of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery and cruelty.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond place, the <hi>poſſibility</hi> of the occaſional exerciſe of ſuch a right, if conceived to exiſt, would be, at leaſt, a flow poiſon, conducing to a ſickly habit of commence; and, in a ſeries of time, would be productive of much more evil than could be counterbalanced by any good which it might be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to obtain in the contemplated emergency, by the uſe of the expedient.</p>
                     <p>Let experience decide—Examples of confiſcation and ſequeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration have been given—When did the dread of them prevent a war? when did it cripple an enemy, ſo as to diſable him from exertion, or force him into a ſubmiſſion to the views of his adverſary? When did it even ſenſibly conſpire to either of theſe ends? If it has ever had any ſuch effect, the evidence of it has not come within my knowledge.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="18" facs="unknown:028389_0594_0FD8ED384B15E018"/>
It is true, that between Great Britain and the United States, the expectation of ſuch effects is better warranted than per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in any other caſes that have exiſted; becauſe we common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly owe a larger debt to that country, than is uſual between na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and there is a relative ſtate of things, which tends to a continuation of this ſituation.</p>
                     <p>But how has the matter operated hitherto? In the late war between the two countries, certain ſtates confiſcated the debts due from their citizens to Britiſh creditors, and theſe creditors actually ſuffered great loſſes. The Britiſh cabinet muſt have known, that it was poſſible the ſame thing might happen in another war, and on a more general ſcale; yet the appearances were extremely ſtrong, at a particular juncture, that it was their plan, either from ill-will, from the belief that popular opinion would ultir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>ly drag our government into the war, from the union of theſe two, or from other cauſes, to force us into hoſtilities with them. Hence it appears, that the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of acts of confiſcation, or ſequeſtration, was not ſufficient to deter from hoſtile views, or to inſure pacific diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</p>
                     <p>It may be pretended, that the menace of this meaſure, had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>lly purſued, under the preſſure of the provocations received, we at leaſt find, in the courſe of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean events, whether ſolution of a change of policy in the cabinet of Great Britain, than from the dread of a legiſlative pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy on the debts due to their merchants.</p>
                     <p>The truth unfortunately is, that the paſſions of men ſtifle calculation; that nations the moſt attentive to pecuniary conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, eaſily ſurrender them to ambition, to jealouſy, to anger, or to revenge.</p>
                     <p>For the ſame reaſon, the actual experiment of an exerciſe of the pretended right, by way of repriſal for an injury com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of, would commonly be as inefficacious, as the menace of it, to arreſt general hoſtilities.—Pride is rouſed; reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment kindled; and where there is even no previous diſpoſition to thoſe hoſtilities, the probability is, that they follow. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, like individuals, ill brook the idea of receding from their pretenſions under the rod, or of admitting the juſtice <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028389_0595_0FD8ED384D0A3DD8"/>of a quarrel with France diverted the ſtorm, by render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him neceſſary as an ally.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps it may be imagined, that the practice of confiſcation or ſequeſtration would be more efficacious to wound and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Great Britain, in caſe of a war, than to prevent it. But this alſo is a vain chimera! A nation, that can, at pleaſure, raiſe by loan twenty millions ſterling, would be in little dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being diſconcerted or enfeebled in her military enter-prizes, by the taking away or arreſting of three or four mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions due to her merchants. Did it produce diſtreſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order among thoſe whom it affected and their connexions? If that diſorder was ſufficient to threaten a general derangement of mercantile credit, and, with it, of the public finances, the pending war affords an example, that the public purſe or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit could be brought ſucceſsfully into action for the ſupport of the ſufferes. Three or four millions of exchequer bills ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in loans, would be likely to ſuffice, to prevent the partial evil from growing into a national calamity.</p>
                     <p>But we forget, that as far as the interruption of the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the debts due to her merchants could be ſuppoſed to operate upon Great Britain, war itſelf would eſſentially anſwer the purpoſes of confiſcation or ſequeſtration—By interrupting trade and intercourſe, it is in fact, in a great degree, a virtual ſequeſtration. Remittances to any extent become impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. There are few ways, in which, on account of the ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap> of war, it is lawful to make them; and debtors are, for the moſt part, enough diſpoſed to embrace pretexts of procraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tination.</p>

                        </gap>he inconvenience of deferred payment would, therefore, be felt by Great Britain, with little mitigation, from the bare exiſtence of war, without the neceſſity of our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment incurring the diſcredit and reſponſibility of a ſpecial interference.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, as far as the dread of eventual loſs can operate, it ought, in a great meaſure to have its effect excluſive of the idea of confiſcation. Great Britain muſt want reflection, not to be ſenſible, that, in making war upon us, ſhe makes war upon her own merchants; by the depredations upon our trade deſtroying thoſe reſources from which they are to be paid. If ſhe be indifferent to this conſideration, it will be becauſe ſhe is governed by ſome motive or paſſion powerful enough to diſpoſe her to run the riſk of the entire loſs—in the reliance of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indemnification by the acquiſitions of war, or in the terms of peace.</p>

Will it be ſaid, that the ſeizure of the debts would put in the hands of our government a valuable reſource for carrying on the war? This, upon trial, would prove at fallacious as all the reſt. Various inducements would prevent debtors from paying into the treaſury. Some would decline it from conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſcruples, from a doubt of the rectitude of the thing— others, with intent to make a merit with their creditors of the concealment, and to favor their own future credit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage —others, from a deſire to retain the money in their own employment—and a great number, from the apprehenſion that the treaty of peace might revive their reſponſibility to the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, with the embarraſſment to themſelves of getting back, as well as they could, the monies which they had paid into the treaſury. Of this, our laſt treaty of peace, in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> opinion of able judges, gave an example.—Theſe cauſes and others, which do not as readily occur, would oppoſe great obſtacles to the execution of the meaſure.</p>
                     <p>But ſevere laws, inflicting heavy penalties, might compel it—Experience does not warrant a ſanguine reliance upon this expedient, in a caſe in which great opportunity of concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is united with ſtrong motives of inclination or intereſt— It would require an inquiſition, juſtly intolerable to a free peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple —penalties, which would confound the due proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween crime and puniſhment, to detect, or to deter from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment and evaſion, and to execute the law—Probably no means leſe efficacious than a <hi>revolutionary tribunial</hi> and a <hi>guillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> would go near to anſwer the end.—There are but few, I truſt, to whom theſe would be welcome means.</p>
                     <p>We may conclude, therefore, that the law would be ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>d to an extent, which would diſappoint the expectations from it, as a reſource. Some monies, no doubt, would be collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but the probability is, that the amount would be inſignificant, even in the ſcale of a ſingle compaign—But, ſhould ſhe collection prove as complete, as it ordinarily is, between debtor and creditor, it would little, if at all, exceed the expenſe of one campaign.</p>
                     <p>Hence we perceive, that, regarding the meaſure, either as a mean of diſabling our enemies, or as a reſource to ourſelves, its conſequence dwindles, upon a cloſe ſurvey; it cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to a magnitude, which would apologize, either for a ſacrifice of national honor or candor, or for a deviation from the true principles of commerce and credit.</p>
                     <p>But let us take a further view of its diſadvantages.</p>
                     <p>A nation, in caſe of war, is under no reſponſibility for the delinquencies or frauds of its citizens, who are debtors to thoſe
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:028389_0597_0FD8ED410C53C300"/>of its enemy, if it does not ſpecially interfere with the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the debts which they owe. But, if it interpoſes its authority to prevent the payment, it gives a claim of indemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to its adverſary, for the intervening loſſes which thoſe delinquencies or frauds may occaſion.—Whether, on the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of peace, this would be inſiſted upon or waved, might depend much on the good or ill ſucceſs of the war; but every thing which adds to the catalogue of our enemy's juſt pretenſions, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the fortune of war has been pretty equal, is an evil, either as an additional obſtacle to ſpeedy peace, or as an ingredient to render the terms of it leſs advantageous to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And it is, therefore, unwiſe in a government to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the liſt of ſuch pretenſions, by a meaſure, which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out utility to itſelf, adminiſters to the indolence of negligent, and to the avidity of fraudulent, individuals.</p>
                     <p>Further—Every ſpecies of repriſal or annoyance, which a power at war employs, contrary to liberality or juſtice, of doubtful propriety, in the eſtimation of the law of nations, departing from that moderation, which, in latter times, ſerves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> mitigate the ſeverities of war, by furniſhing a pretext or provocation to the other ſide to reſort to extremities, ſerves to embitter the ſpirit of hoſtilities, and to extend its ravages. War is then apt to become more ſanguinary, more waſting, and every way more deſtructive. This is a ground of ſerious reflection to every nation, both as it regards humanity and policy; to this country it preſents itſelf, accompanied with conſiderations of peculiar force. A vaſtly-extended ſea-coaſt, overſpread with defenceleſs towns, would offer an abundant p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>y to an incenſed and malignant enemy, having the power to command the ſea. The uſages of modern war forbid hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of this kind; and though they are not always reſpected, yet, as they are never violated, unleſs by way of retaliation for a violation of them on the other ſide, without exciting the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the impartial part of mankind, ſullying the glory; and blaſting the reputation of the party which diſregards them, this conſideration has, in general, force ſufficient to induce an obſervance of them. But the confiſcation or ſequeſtration of private debts, or private property in public funds, now gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally regarded as an odious and unwarrantable meaſure, would, as between us and Great Britain, contain a poignant ſting. Its effect to exaſperate, in an extreme degree, both the nation and government of that country, cannot be doubted. A diſpoſition to retaliate, is a natural conſequence; and it would not be difficult for us to be made to ſuffer beyond any poſſible degree of advantage to be derived from the occaſion of the retaliation.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:028389_0598_0FD8ED4206D976B8"/>It were much wiſer to leave the property of Britiſh ſubjects, an untouched pledge for the moderation of its government, in the mode of proſecuting the war.</p>
                     <p>Beſides (as, if requiſite, might be proved from the records of hiſtory) in national controverſies, it is of real importance to conciliate the good opinion of mankind; and it is even uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to preſerve or gain that of our enemy. The latter facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates accommodation and peace; the former attracts good of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, friendly interventions, ſometimes direct ſupport, from others.—The exemplary conduct, in general, of our country, in our conteſt for independence, was probably not a little ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to us in this way; it ſecured, to the intrinſic goodneſs of our cauſe, every collateral advantage, and gave it a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity among nations, unalloyed and unimpaired, which even ſtole into the cabinets of princes. A contrary policy tends to contrary conſequences. Though nations, in the main, are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by what they ſuppoſe their intereſt, he muſt be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly verſed in human nature, who thinks it indifferent, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the maxims of a ſtate tend to excite kind or unkind diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions in others, or who does not know, that theſe diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may inſenſibly mould or bias the views of ſelf-intereſt.— This were to ſuppoſe that rulers only reaſon—do not feel; in other words, are not men.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, the meaſures of war ought ever to look forward to peace. The confiſcation or ſequeſtration of the private pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of an enemy muſt always be a point of ſerious diſcuſſion, when intereſt or neceſſity leads to negociations for peace. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs when abſolutely proſtrate by the war, reſtitution is likely to conſtitute an ultimatum of the ſuffering party. It muſt be agreed to, or the war protracted, and at laſt, it is probable, it muſt ſtill be agreed to. Should a refuſal of reſtitution prolong the war for only one year, the chance is, that more will be loſt than was gained by the confiſcation. Should it be neceſſary finally to make it, after prolonging the war, the diſadvantage will preponderate in a ratio to the prolongation. Should it be, in the firſt inſtance, aſſented to, what will have been gained? The temporary uſe of a fund of inconſiderable moment, in the general iſſue of the war, at the expenſe of juſtice, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, credit, and, perhaps, of having ſharpened the evils of war. How infinitely preferable to have drawn an equal fund from our own reſources, which, with good management, is always practicable!—If the reſtitution includes damages, on account of the interference, for the failures of individuals, the loan will have been the moſt coſtly that could have been made. It has been elſewhere obſerved, that our treaty of peace with
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:028389_0599_0FD8ED45F8A6E248"/>Great Britain gives an example of reſtitution. The late one between France and Pruſſia gives another. This muſt become every day more and more a matter of courſe, becauſe the immunity of mercantile debts becomes every day more and more important to trade, better underſtood to be ſo, and more clearly conſidered as enjoined by the principles of the law of nations.</p>
                     <p>Thus we ſee, that in reference to the ſimple queſtion of war and peace, the meaſure of confiſcation or ſequeſtration is mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with every feature of impolicy.</p>
                     <p>We have before ſeen, that the pretenſions of a right to do the one or the other, has a moſt inimical aſpect towards commerce and credit.</p>
                     <p>Let us reſume this view of the ſubject. The credit, which our merchants have been able to obtain abroad, eſſentially in Great Britain, has, from the firſt ſettlement of our country to this day, been the animating principle of our foreign com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. This every merchant knows and feels;—and every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent merchant is ſenſible, that, for many years to come, the caſe muſt continue the ſame. This, in our ſituation, is a peculiar reaſon, of the utmoſt force, for renouncing the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion in queſtion.</p>
                     <p>The exerciſe of it, or the ſerious apprehenſion of its exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, would neceſſarily have one of two effects.—It would deprive our merchants of the credit, ſo important to them, or it would oblige them to pay a premium for it, proportioned to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the riſk. Or, to ſpeak more truly, it would combine the two effects; it would cramp credit, and ſubject what was given to a high premium. The moſt obvious and familiar prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of human action eſtabliſh, that the conſideration for money or property, lent or credited, is moderate or otherwiſe, according to the opinion of ſecurity or hazard, and that the quantity of either to be obtained, on loan or credit, is in a great degree contracted or enlarged by the ſame rule.</p>
                     <p>Thus ſhould we, in the operations of our trade, pay ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitantly for a pretenſion, which is of little value, or rather, which is pernicious, even in the relations to which its utility is referred. What folly to cheriſh it! How much greater the folly ever to think of exerciſing it! It never can be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed hereafter, in our country, without great and laſting miſchief.</p>
                     <p>Inſtead of cheriſhing ſo odious a pretenſion, as "our beſt, our only weapon of defence,"—wiſdom admoniſhes us to be eager to caſt it from us, as a weapon moſt dangerous to the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:028389_0600_0FD8ED4762F20B80"/>wearer, proſcribed by the laws of nations, by the laws of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and by every principle of ſound policy.</p>
                     <p>Every merchant ought to deſire that the moſt perfect tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, on this point, in foreign countries, ſhould facilitate to him, on the beſt and cheapeſt terms, the credit for which he has occaſion. And every other citizen ought to deſire, that he may be thus freed from a continual contribution, in the enhanced price of every imported commodity he conſumes, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards defraying the premium which the want of that tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is calculated to generate.</p>

                     <p>The 18th article of our treaty of amity and commerce with the United Netherlands, is in theſe words:</p>
                     <p>"For the better promoting of commerce, on both ſides, it is agreed, that if a war ſhould break out between their high mightineſſes, the States General of the United Netherlands, and the United States of America, there ſhall always be granted to the ſubjects on each ſide, the term of nine months, after the date of the rupture or the proclamation of war, to the end that they may retire with their effects, and tranſport them where they pleaſe, which it ſhall be lawful for them to do, as well as to ſell and tranſport their effects and goods, with all freedom and without any hindrance, and without being able
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:028389_0601_0FD8ED4910BC6898"/>to proceed, during the ſaid term of nine months, to any arreſt of their effects, much leſs of their perſons; on the contrary, there ſhall be given them, for their veſſels and effects which they would carry away, paſſports and ſafe conducts for the neareſt ports of their reſpective countries, and for the time neceſſary for the voyage."</p>
                     <p>The 22d article of our treaty of amity and commerce with Sweden, is in theſe words:</p>
                     <p>"In order to favor commerce, on both ſides, as much as poſſible, it is agreed, that in caſe war ſhould break out between the two nations, the term of nine months after the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of war ſhall be allowed to the merchants and ſubjects reſpectively, on one ſide and on the other, in order that they may withdraw with their effects and moveables, which they ſhall be at liberty to carry off or to ſell where they pleaſe, without the leaſt obſtacle—nor ſhall any ſeize their effects, and much leſs their perſons, during the ſaid nine months; but on the contrary, paſſports, which ſhall be valid for a time neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for their return, ſhall be given them for their veſſels and the effects which they ſhall be willing to carry with them—and, if any thing is taken from them, or any injury is done to them by one of the parties, their people and ſubjects, during the term above preſcribed, full and entire ſatisfaction ſhall be made to them on that account."</p>
                     <p>The 23d article of our treaty of amity and commerce with Pruſſia, contains this proviſion:</p>
                     <p>"If war ſhould ariſe between the two contracting parties, the merchants of either country, then reſiding in the other, ſhall be allowed to remain nine months, to collect their debts and ſettle their affairs, and may depart freely, carrying off all their effects without moleſtation or hindrance."</p>
                     <p>Theſe articles of four, and the only commercial treaties we had with foreign powers, prior to the pending treaty with Great Britain, though differing in terms, agree in ſubſtance; except as to time, which varies from ſix to nine months. And they clearly amount to this, that upon the breaking out of a war between the contracting parties in each caſe, there ſhall be, for a term of ſix or nine months, full protection and ſecurity to the perſons and property of the ſubjects of one, which are then in the territories of the other, with liberty to collect their debts,<note n="*" place="bottom">The term "debts," is only expreſſed in the Pruſſian treaty, but there are in the other treaties, terms which include debts, and this is the manifeſt ſpirit and intent of all.</note> to ſell their goods and merchandizes, and to remove,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:028389_0602_0FD8ED4A6673E328"/>with their effects, whereſoever they pleaſe. For this term of ſix or nine months, there is a complete ſuſpenſion of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended right to confiſcate or ſequeſter, giving, or being deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give, an opportunity to withdraw the whole property which the ſubjects or citizens of one party have in the country of the other.</p>
                     <p>The differences between theſe ſtipulations and that in the article under examination are chiefly theſe: the latter is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to debts, property in the public funds and in public and private banks, without any limitation of the duration of the protection—The former comprehends, in addition, goods and merchandizes, with a limitation of the protection to a term of ſix or nine months; but with the intent and ſuppoſition that the term allowed may and will be adequate to entire ſecurity. The principle, therefore, of all the ſtipulations is the ſame; each aims at putting the perſons and property of the ſubjects of one enemy, eſpecially merchants, being within the country of the other enemy at the commencement of a war, out of the reach of confiſcation or ſequeſtration.</p>
                     <p>The perſons whoſe names are to our other treaties, on the part of the United States, are Benjamin Franklin, Silas Deane, Arthur Lee, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferſon. The three firſt are to the treaty with France—Mr. Adams is ſingly to that with the United Netherlands—Dr. Franklin ſingly to that with Sweden, and theſe two, with Mr. Jefferſon, are jointly to that with Pruſſia—The treaty with Sweden was concluded in April 1783; that with Pruſſia, in Auguſt, 1785. Theſe dates repel the idea, that conſiderations of policy, relative to the war might have operated in the caſe.</p>
                     <p>We have, conſequently, the ſanction of all theſe characters to the principle, which governed the ſtipulation entered into by Mr. Jay, and not only from the ratification of the former treaties at different periods, diſtant from each other, by differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent deſcriptions of men in our public councils, but alſo from there never having been heard, in the community, a liſp of murmur againſt the ſtipulation, through a period of ſeventeen years, counting from the date of the treaty with France, there is juſt ground to infer a coincidence of the public opinion of the country.</p>
                     <p>I verily believe, that if, in the year 1783, a treaty had been made with England, containing an article ſimilar to the 10th in the preſent treaty, it would have met with general acquieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. The ſpirit of party had not then prediſpoſed men's minds to eſtimate the propriety of a meaſure according to the agent, rather than according to its real fitneſs and quality.
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:028389_0603_0FD8ED4F0E8CD698"/>What would then have been applauded as wiſe, liberal, equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and expedient, is now, in more inſtances than one, under the peſtilential influence of that baleſul ſpirit, condemned as improvident, impolitic, and dangerous.</p>
                     <p>Our treaty with Pruſſia, the 23d article of which has been cited, is indeed a model of liberality, which, for the principles it contains, does honor to the parties, and has been in this country a ſubject of deſerved and unqualified admiration. It contradicts, as if ſtudiouſly, thoſe principles of reſtriction and excluſion, which are the foundations of the mercantile and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigating ſyſtem of Europe. It grants perfect freedom of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and worſhip to the reſpective ſubjects and citizens, with no other reſtraint than that they ſhall not inſult the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of others. Adopting the rule, that free ſhips ſhall make free goods, it extends the protection to the perſons as well as to the goods of enemies.—Enumerating, as contraband, only "arms, ammunition, and military ſtores," it even provides that contraband articles ſhall not be conſiſcated, but may be taken on the condition of paying for them. It provides againſt embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes of veſſels and effects. It expreſsly exempts women, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſcholars of every faculty, cultivators of the earth, arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zan, manufacturers, and fiſhermen, unarmed and inhabiting unfortified towns, villages, and places, and in general, all others whoſe occupations are for the common ſubſiſtence and benefit of mankind, their houſes, fields, and goods, from mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation in their perſons and employments, and from burning, waſting, and deſtruction, in time of war; and ſtipulates pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at a reaſonable price for what may be neceſſarily taken from them for military uſe.—It likewiſe protects from feizure and confiſcation, in time of war, veſſels employed in trade, and inhibits the granting commiſſions to private armed veſſels, empowering them to take or deſtroy ſuch trading veſſels, or to interrupt their commerce; and it makes a variety of excellent proviſions to ſecure to priſoners of war, a humane treatment.</p>
                     <p>Theſe particulars are ſtated as evidence of the temper of the day, and of a policy, which then prevailed, to bottom our ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem with regard to foreign nations upon thoſe grounds of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and equity, by which reaſon, religion and philoſophy has tempered the harſh maxims of more early times. It is pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to obſerve an effort to make the public opinion, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, retrograde, and to infect our councils with a ſpirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to theſe ſalutary advances towards improvement in true civilization and humanity.</p>
                     <p>If we paſs from our own treaties, to thoſe between other nations, we find that the proviſions, which have been extracted
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:028389_0604_0FD8ED505FB8ED08"/>from ours, have very nearly become formulas in the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Europe. As examples of this may be conſulted, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is a memorial of Mr. Buſſy, miniſter from the court of France to that of London, for negociating peace, dated in the year 1761, and contains theſe paſſages: "As it is impracticable for two princes, who make war with <hi>each other, to agree between them which is the aggreſſor with regard to the other,</hi>

                     <p>"This wiſe proviſion, ſo agreeable to the rules of good faith, <hi>conſtitutes a part of the law of nations,</hi> and the article of the treaty, which ſanctifies theſe precautions, ought to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully executed, notwithſtanding the breach of the other articles of the treaty which is the natural conſequence of the war.</p>

                     <p>If the law of nations confers this exemption from ſeizure upon veſſels, which, at the time of the rupture, happen to be in the reſpective ports of the belligerent parties, it is evident that it muſt equally extend its protection to debts contracted in a courſe of lawful trade. Veſſels are particularly mentioned, becauſe the diſcuſſion turned upon veſſels ſeized at ſea. But the reference to the treaties of Utrecht and Aix la Chapelle ſhows, that the miniſter, in his obſervation, had in view the whole ſubject matter of the articles of thoſe treaties, which provide for the ſecurity of merchants and their effects in the event of war.</p>

                     <p>Shall I treat this rhapſody with ſeriouſneſs or ridicule?</p>
                     <p>The capital of the bank of the United States is ten millions of dollars, little ſhort, at the preſent market price, of three millions of pounds ſterling; but, from the natural operation of ſuch a demand, in raiſing the price, it is not probable that much leſs than four millions ſterling would ſuffice to complete the monopoly. I have never underſtood, that the private purſe of his Britannic majeſty, if it be true, as aſſerted, that he has already witneſſed a reliſh for ſpeculation in our funds (a fact, however, from which it was natural to infer a more pacific diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition towards us) was ſo very ample as conveniently to ſpare an item of ſuch ſize for a ſpeculation acroſs the Atlantic. But, perhaps, the national purſe will be brought to his aid—As this ſuppoſes a parliamentary grant, new taxes and new loans, it does not ſeem to be a very manageable thing, without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure

For let it be remembered, that the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle does not protect the public property of a foreign government, prince, or ſtate, independent of the obſervation juſt made, that ſuch a caſe would be without the reach of ordinary rules. It may be added, that an attempt of this kind, from the force of the pecuniary capital of Great Britain, would, as a precedent, threaten and alarm all nations. Would conſequences like theſe be incurred?</p>

                     <p>Of two things, one, either the monopoly of his Britannic majeſty would be known (and it would be a pretty arduous taſk to keep it a ſecret, eſpecially if the ſtock was to ſtand, as ſuggeſted, in the name of his ambaſſador) or it would be unknown and concealed under unſuſpected names: In the former ſuppoſition, the obſervations already made recur. There would be no protection to it from the article; and the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary nature of the caſe would warrant any thing—Would his majeſty or the parliament chooſe to truſt ſo large a property in ſo perilous a ſituations?</p>
                     <p>If, to avoid this, the plan-ſhould be to keep the operation unknown, the moſt effectual method would be to place the ſtock in the names of our own citizens. This, it ſeems, would be attended with no difficulty; ſince even our ſenators would be ambitious of the honor: and if they ſhould have qualms and fears, others more compliant could, no doubt, be found amongſt the numerous ſecretaries or adherents of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in our country: probably ſome of the patriots would not be inexotable, if properly ſolicited. Or, in the laſt reſort, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons might be ſent from Great Britain to acquire naturalization for the expreſs purpoſe.</p>

In this ſuppoſition, too, the article would be at the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent. For its proviſions are entirely foreign to the caſe of ſtock ſtanding in the names of our own citizens. It neither enlarges nor abridges the power of the government in this reſpect.</p>
                     <p>Further, how will the article work the miracle of placing the bank under the management of Britiſh directors? It gives no new rights, no new qualifications.</p>
                     <p>The conſtitution of the bank (ſection the 5th, 7th of the act of incorporation) has provided, with ſolicitude, theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant guards, againſt foreign or other ſiniſter influence—

It is alſo next to impoſſible, that an undue Britiſh influence could operate in the choice of directors, out of the number of our own citizens. The Britiſh king, or Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh ſubjects out of the United States, could not even have a vote by attorney, in the choice. Schemes of ſecret monopoly could not be executed, becauſe they would be betrayed, unleſs the ſecret was confined to a ſmall number. A ſmall number, no one of whom could have more than thirty votes, would be eaſily over-ruled by the more numerous proprietors of ſingle or a ſmall number of ſhares, with the addition of the votes of the United States.</p>
                     <p>But here again it is to be remembered, that as to combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with our own citizens, in which they were to be oſtenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any pernicious foreign project—the article under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration is perfectly nugatory—It can do neither good nor harm, ſince it merely relates, as to the exemption from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcation and ſeizure on our part, to the known property of Britiſh ſubjects.</p>
                     <p>It follows, therefore, that the dangers pourtrayed to us from the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But though we are not chargeable with having contributed to the eſtabliſhment of theſe errors, ſo diſcouraging to the induſtry and perplexing in the intercourſe of nations, we found them ſo deeply rooted and ſo extenſively prevalent, that our voice
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:028389_0613_0FD8ED6F1D6CCA88"/>and opinions would have been little regarded, had we expreſſed a deſire of a ſyſtem more liberal and advantageous to all.</p>
                     <p>The rights of commerce among nations between whom exiſt no treaties, are imperfect.</p>
                     <p>"The law of nature," ſays Vattel, (b. 1 ſ. 89) "gives to no perſon whatever, the leaſt kind of right to ſell what belongs to him, to another who does not want to buy it; nor has any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that of felling its commodities or merchandize to a people who are unwilling to have them. Every man and every nation being perfectly at liberty to buy a thing that is to be ſold, or not to buy it, and to buy it of one rather than of another."— "Every ſtate has conſtantly," continues the ſame author, "a right to prohibit the entrance of foreign merchandi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

A ſimple permiſſion to trade with a nation, gives no perfect right to that trade; it may be carried on ſo long as permitted; but the nation granting ſuch permiſſion is under no obligation to continue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> with another nation can alone be procured by treaty.</p>
                     <p>From the precarious nature of trade between nations, as well as from the deſire of obtaining ſpecial advantages and preferences in carrying it on, originated the earlieſt conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the ſubject of commerce. The firſt commercial treaty that placed the parties on a more ſecure and better footing in their dealings with each other than exiſted in their reſpective intercourſe with other nations, inſpired others with a deſire to eſtabliſh, by ſimilar treaties, an equally advantageous ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement. Thus one treaty was followed by another, until, as was the caſe when the United States became an independent power, all nations had entered into extenſive and complicated ſtipulations, concerning their navigation, manufactures and commerce.</p>
                     <p>This being the actual condition of the commercial world, when we arrived at our ſtation in it, the like inducements to render certain that, which, by the law of nations, was preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and to participate in the advantages ſecured by national agreements, prompted our government to propoſe to all, and to conclude with ſeveral, of the European nations, treaties of comme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>e.</p>
                     <p>Immediately after the concluſion of the war, congreſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Mr. Adams, Doctor Franklin, and Mr. Jefferſon, joint
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:028389_0614_0FD8ED7145DD4C08"/>commiſſioners, to propoſe and conclude commercial treaties with the different nations of Europe. This commiſſion was opened at Paris, and overtures were made to the different powers (including Great Britain) through their miniſters reſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Paris. The baſis of theſe numerous treaties, which congreſs were deſirous to form, was, that the parties ſhould reſpectively enjoy the rights of the moſt favored nations. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious anſwers were given by the foreign miniſters, in behalf on their ſeveral nations. But the treaty with Pruſſia was the only one concluded, of the very great number propoſed by the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican commiſſioners. Mr. Adams, in 1785, was removed to London, Dr. Franklin ſoon after returned to America, and Mr. Jefferſon ſucceeded him as miniſter at Paris. Thus failed the project of forming commercial treaties with almoſt every power in Europe. Treaties with Ruſſia, Denmark, Great Britain, Spain and Portugal, would have been of importance; but the ſcheme of extending treaties of commerce to all the minor powers of Europe, not omitting his holineſs the pope was, it muſt be acknowledged, ſomewhat chimerical, and could not fail to have caſt an air of ridicule on the commiſſions that with great ſolemnity were ope<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Further, from the firſt ſeſſion of congreſs, to that during which Mr. Jay's appointment took place, efforts were made to diſcriminate, in our revenue and commercial laws, between thoſe nations with whom we had, and thoſe with whom we had not, commercial treaties—The avowed object of which diſcrimination was, to place the latter nations on a leſs advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous commercial footing than the former, in order to induce them likewiſe to form commercial treaties with us; and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be forgotten by thoſe, who affect to ſuppoſe that it was not expected that a treaty of commerce would be formed by
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:028389_0616_0FD8ED7689E8D5B0"/>Mr. Jay, that Mr. <hi>Madiſon's</hi> commercial reſolutions, which were under conſideration at the time of Mr. Jay's appointment, grew out of, and were built upon, a clauſe of Mr. Jefferſon's report of the 26th December, 1793, which aſſerts that Great Britain diſcovered no diſpoſition to enter into a commercial treaty with us. The report alluded to is explicit in declaring a preference of friendly arrangements, by treaties of commerce, to regulations by the acts of our legiſlature, and authorizes the inference, under which the commercial reſolutions were brought forward, that the latter ſhould be reſorted to, only when the former cannot be effected.</p>
                     <p>The power of the executive to form commercial treaties, and the objection againſt the commercial articles before us, as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtitutional interference with the legiſlative powers of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, will, in the ſequel, be diſtinctly examined, together with other objections on the point of conſtitutionality.</p>
                     <p>Againſt the policy of regulating commerce by treaty, rather than by acts of the legiſlature, it is ſaid, that the legiſlative acts can, but that a treaty cannot, be repealed. This remark is true, and of weight againſt the formation of commercial trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which are to be of long duration, or, like our commercial treaty with France, which is per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

For, as we are year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advancing in agriculture, manufactories, commerce, naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſtrength, our treaties of commerce, eſpecially ſuch as, by particular ſtipulations, ſhall give to the parties other rights than thoſe of the moſt favored nation, ought to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>One branch, and a principal one of this ſyſtem, that which eſtabliſhes the connexion between the ſeveral European nations and their colonies, merits our particular attention. An exact knowledge of this connexion would aſſiſt us in forming a juſt eſtimate of the difficulties that ſtand in oppoſition to our claim of free and full participation in the colony trade of Great Britain.</p>
                     <p>Unlike the plan of colonization adopted by the ancient go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, who, from the crouded population of their cities, ſent forth and eſtabliſhed beneath their auſpices new and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent republics, the colonies of modern times have been planted with entirely different views; retained in a ſtate of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on the parent country, their connexion has been made ſubſervient to that ſpirit of monopoly, which has ſhown itſelf among all the commercial powers.

It was not againſt this dependence and commercial monopoly that the colonies complained! They were willing to ſubmit to them. It was the unjuſt attempt to tax them, to raiſe a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue from them, without their conſent, which combined that firm and ſpirited oppoſition, which effected a diviſion of the empire—thus the congreſs of 1775, in their laſt addreſs to the inhabitants of Great Britain, ſay, "We chearfully conſent to ſuch acts of the Britiſh parliament as ſhall be reſtrained to the regulations of our external commerce, <hi>for the purpoſe of ſecuring the commercial advantages of the whole empure to the mother coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> and the commercial benefit of its reſpective members! ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding every idea of taxation internal or external for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of raiſing a revenue on the ſubjects in America without their conſent." The "colonial codes of other nations are marked with the ſame ſpirit of monopoly:—thus Portugal ſhuts out all foreigners from the Brazils as well as from her Aſiatic poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Spain from South America and her Weſt India iſlands, France excludes all foreigners from her Aſiatic dominions, and

                     <p>So uniform and perſevering has been the practice of nations on this point, that in the lateſt treaties of commerce between France and Spain, between each of theſe powers and Great Britain, between Great Britain, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, and Portugal, we do not diſcover, that any one of theſe powers, has conſented to admit the others to a participation in the trade

                     <p>Monteſquieu calls this law appropriating the colony com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce to the benefit of the parent ſtate, "A fundamental law of Europe."

Thus it is ſtill a fundamental law of Europe, that all commerce with a foreign colony ſhall be regarded as a mere monopoly, puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the laws of the country; and in this caſe we are not to be directed by the laws and precedents of the ancients, which are not at all applicable."</p>
                     <p>"It is likewiſe acknowledged that a commerce eſtabliſhed between the mother countries, does not include a permiſſion to trade in the colonies; for theſe always continue in a ſtate of prohibition." [Monteſquieu, Liv. xxi. chap. xvii.]</p>

Some nations, and among them Great Britain, have viewed the excluſive na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation and trade to their colonies, in the light in which they have ſeen their coaſting trade and fiſheries; as a nurſery for that body of ſeamen, whom they have conſidered not only as neceſſary to the proſperity and protection of commerce, but as eſſential to the defence and ſafety of the ſtate.</p>

                     <p>HOWEVER uniform may have been the law of Europe in relation to their colonial eſtabliſhments, no pains have been ſpared to create an opinion that France has been guided by a more liberal policy than the other colonizing powers, and that the regulations of her colony trade were eſſentially diſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar from theirs; moreover that her diſintereſtedneſs was ſo great, that ſhe not long ſince propoſed to our government to eſtabliſh by treaty, a trade between us and her Weſt India colonies equally free with that which prevails in her own intercourſe with them. The object of theſe attempts is readily perceived.</p>
                     <p>As there was no probability, that Great Britain would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to our trading with her Weſt India colonies on the ſame terms as ſhe herſelf does, as it was foreſeen that limitations and conditions would accompany any agreement that ſhould be made on this ſubject; to extol the liberty of France, and exclaim againſt the monopolizing views of Great Britain, were deemed ſuitable means to excite a prejudice againſt the expected adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                     <p>France, like England, has endeavoured to ſecure the greateſt poſſible portion of advantage to herſelf, by her colonial laws, and the conceſſions yielded to foreigners have been only ſuch deviations from an entire monopoly, as her own intereſt has rendered indiſpenſable—France, in imitation of the Engliſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation law, as early as 1727, eſtabliſhed an ordinance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming to the mother country the monopoly of the trade to her colonies, and excluding thereby all foreigners—Experience proved the neceſſity of moderating the rigour of their ordinance, and relaxations in favor of a limited foreign intercourſe exiſted at the time when our commercial treaty with France was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, by the thirtieth article of which, it is agreed, that France will continue to the citizens of the United States, the free ports, which have been and are open in their Weſt Indi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Such were the duties on the foreign, and the premiums on the national fiſh, that together they would have been equivalent to a prohibition of the former, had the national fiſhery been able to ſupply the conſumption.</p>

                     <p>All cotton, coffee, ſugar, and other productions (rum and melaſſes excepted) were prohibited; and we could, except oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally by local relaxations of the general law, rightfully obtain none of them from the French Weſt India iſlands— This was the footing of our trade under our treaty and the ſtanding edict which preceded the French revolution, and even this was liable to ſtill further limitations, whenever France ſhould think proper to impoſe them; the treaty ſecuring only a right to as free a commerce as France ſhould grant to other foreign nations.</p>
                     <p>Great Britain has permitted the importation into her Weſt India colonies of all the foreign articles, allowed by France to be imported into her iſlands (ſalted fiſh and ſalted beef ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) and ſhe moreover permitted the importation of foreign tobacco, flour, meal, biſcuit, wheat, and various other grains which France prohibited—In return for theſe commodities, Great Britain permitted the exportation from her iſlands to our country, of rum and melaſſes, and moreover of ſugar, coffee, cocoa, ginger, and pimento, together with ſuch other articles as are allowed to be carried from their iſlands to any other foreign country.</p>
                     <p>Great Britain prohibited the importation and exportation of moſt of theſe articles to and from all foreign nations, except the United States—France permitted the intercourſe with her colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, under the ſame limitations to us in common with all other foreign nations.</p>
                     <p>The articles received from us by Great Britain, for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of her Weſt India iſlands, exceeded in variety thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from us by France for the ſupply of her iſlands, the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Weſt Indies were, therefore, in the ordinary and eſtabliſhed courſe more extenſive cuſtomers to us than the French Weſt Indies. Again, the articles which we received from the Britiſh Weſt Indies and which we were prohibited from receiving from the French Weſt Indies, were among the moſt valuable of their productions, and, from the force of habit, ſome of them are included in the catalogue of articles of the firſt neceſſity in our conſumption. In point of ſupply, therefore, the Britiſh were better furniſhers, their colonial laws being much leſs reſtrictive than thoſe of France.</p>
                     <p>Though the regulations of the Britiſh Weſt India trade were more favorable to our agriculture than thoſe of France, and though the articles with which we were ſupplied from the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh iſlands were more numerous and valuable than thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:028389_0624_0FD8ED8ADF8DE180"/>from the iſlands of France, the colony ſyſtem of the latter was preferable to that of the former in relation to our navigation. France permitted our veſſels of and above ſixty tons burthen, to carry and bring away the articles, not prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited in the foreign trade with her iſlands, while Great Britain confined the trade to her own veſſels and excluded thoſe of all foreign nations.</p>
                     <p>Difference of ſituation, and not of principle, produced this variety or diſtinction in the colony ſyſtem of the two nations. France being able from her reſources to ſupply moſt of the articles requiſite for the conſumption of her Weſt Indies, and from her great population, having a proportionate demand for the productions of her iſlands, ſhe has been carefully reſtrictive in the trade between her colonies and foreign countries as to the articles of import and export.</p>
                     <p>All the productions of her iſlands, muſt go to the mother country, except rum and melaſſes; theſe articles were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to France, becauſe they would have directly interfered with the valuable manufacture of her brandies. On the other hand, Great Britain, being leſs able from her internal reſources to ſupply the articles neceſſary for the conſumption of her Weſt Indies, and her population, or home demand not requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole productions of her iſlands, ſhe has been more liberal in the trade allowed to be carried on between her colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and foreign countries as to the articles of import and export. But her navigation being adequate to the whole trade of all he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Both France and Great Britain relax their colonial laws, in times of occaſional ſcarcity and when they are engaged in war; during which, the intercourſe with their Weſt India poſſeſſions is laid more open to foreigners. The catalogue of ſupplies is ſometimes enlarged, and Great Britain, as well as France, during theſe relaxations, permits American veſſels to reſort to, and engage in the commerce of, their iſlands.</p>
                     <p>It is notwithſtanding from the permanent laws alone of theſe nations, that we are able to infer their views in relation to their colony trade! the exceptions and deviations that become neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary by reaſon of accidental ſcarcity or the embarraſſments of war, ſerve only to explain more clearly the principles of the permanent ſyſtem.</p>

The reſult of this compariſon affords no ſupport for the aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that France has been leſs excluſive, or more liberal in her colony ſyſtem, than Great Britain—both theſe nations have in the eſtabliſhment of their colonial laws alike diſregarded the intereſts of foreign nations, and have been equally under the controul of the principles of ſelf-intereſt, which ever have, and ever will govern the affairs of nations.<note n="*" place="bottom">The opinion heretofore cited of <hi>Monteſquieu,</hi> a Frenchman, agreeing with facts, is a poſitive teſtimony that the principle of the French ſyſtem, like the Engliſh, <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>Equal artifice has been practiſed, and no leſs credulity diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played, on the ſubject of a new treaty of commerce, which it is boldly aſſerted, France from the moſt <hi>diſintereſted</hi> motives has offered to us. It ſhould be recollected that France already has a treaty of commerce with us, a treaty that is not limited to two years, nor twelve years, but one that is to endure for ever—This treaty is as favorable to France as ſhe can deſire, or we in our utmoſt fondneſs be diſpoſed to make—It ſecures to her our acquieſcence in an excluſion from her Aſiatic dominions, and in freſh regulations as her intereſt ſhall dictate relative to our intercourſe with her Weſt India poſſeſſions—It excludes us from her fiſheries on the banks of Newfoundland, which ſhe was unwilling to ſhare with us, and it gives to her every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial favor or privilege which by treaty we may yield to any other nation, freely when freely granted, and when otherwiſe on yielding the ſame equivalent—her productions, her manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, her merchandizes, and her ſhips may come into all our ports to which any other foreign productions, manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, merchandizes, or ſhips may come—they are ſeverally to pay only the <hi>loweſt</hi> duties paid by any other nation, and no other nation in its intercourſe and trade with us, is, in any inſtance, to have a preference over her—A variety of other regulations are inſerted in this treaty uſeful to France and not particularly diſſerviceable to us.</p>
                     <p>This treaty has been religiouſly obſerved and executed on our part; France has repeatedly violated it in the article which makes enemy goods free in neutral bottoms, while it is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood

What muſt have been our infatuation, what the meaſure of our folly, had we given implicit credit to words ſo much a variance with cotemporary actions? But it is aſked, do not the letters of Mr. Genet to Mr. Jefferſon, which have been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, prove that France deſired and offered to enter into a new diſintereſted and liberal treaty of commerce with us? The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion ſhall be fairly examined.</p>
                     <p>There are two letters from Mr. Genet on this ſubject—Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after his arrival at Philadelphia, in a letter to Mr. Jeffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the 23d May, 1793, he ſays—"The French republic has given it in charge to me to propoſe to your government to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate by a true <hi>family</hi> compact, by a national covenant, the liberal and fraternal baſis, on which it wiſhes to eſtabliſh the commercial and political ſyſtem of two people, whoſe intereſts are inſeparably connected."</p>
                     <p>If the object of this propoſal was a reviſion of our commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial treaty, in order to render the intercourſe between us more
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:028389_0627_0FD8ED93C64D5F70"/>free and advantageous, this miniſter was ſingularly unfortunate in his expreſſions—He might have employed the fine phraſe of conſecrating by a true family compact, by a national covenant, the liberal and fraternal baſis on which it was wiſhed to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the commercial ſyſtem of the two countries, and have been intelligible; but when he tells us, that he is inſtructed to open a negociation with our government, for the purpoſe of eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the commercial and political ſyſtem of the two countries, what are we to underſtand? That trade and its regulations are alone in view? Or that a family compact eſtabliſhing the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, as well as the commercial ſyſtem of the two nations, muſt include likewiſe the league or treaty of alliance, whereby the ſtrength and wealth of the two nations ſhould be cloſely united in the proſecution of a common object?</p>
                     <p>This ambiguous overture, if its meaning is not too plain to allow the epithet, was received in the moſt friendly manner by our government, and on the ſuggeſtion that the ſenate are united with the preſident in making treaties, it was underſtood between Mr. Jefferſon and Mr. Genet, that the ſubject ſhould be deferred till the meeting of congreſs.</p>
                     <p>Before that period, however, Mr. Genet, in a letter of the 30th of September, 1793, renews the propoſal to open the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation relative to the propoſed family compact between us and France; and proves to us that our benefit was its principal excluſive object, by affectionately intimating in the concluſion of his letter, that he is further inſtructed to tell us, in caſe of refuſal or evaſion on our part to enter into this family agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that France will repeal the laws dictated by the attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the French for the Americans.</p>
                     <p>Had it before been doubted whether political engagements relative to war, were intended to be connected with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed treaty, theſe doubts muſt have diſappeared on the receipt of this ſecond letter from Mr. Genet; the intimation that the laws of France which operated favorably to our trade with their dominions, would be repealed, in caſe we refuſed or evaded the concluſion of a new treaty, cannot be reconciled, with the belief, that this treaty was ſought for from motives purely commercial, or ſolely to enlarge and add proſperity to our trade.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Genet at this time had ſo outraged our government as to have compelled them to requeſt his recall, he muſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, have been convinced, that no conſcience would be held with him except on points of urgent importance, and ſuch as would not admit of delay—He was, therefore, anſwered by Mr. Jefferſon on the 5th of November, that his letter had been

                        </gap> Mr. Jefferſon's letter to Mr. Morris of the 23d of Auguſt, we are informed that our government were deſirous to go into a commercial negociation with France, and, therefore, requeſted that the powers given to Mr. Genet on that ſubject ſhould be renewed to his ſucceſſor—It has not appeared that this was ever done—His immediate ſucceſſor, Mr. Fauchet, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, gave no evidence of his having any powers relative to a commercial treaty; and if reports, which arrived with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent miniſter, having great marks of authenticity, may be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, he has power only to <hi>digeſt</hi> the articles of ſuch a treaty, not to <hi>conclude one.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding the internal evidence contained in the two letters of Mr. Genet was ſufficient to have ſatisfied a ſenſible people, that ſomething beyond a commercial treaty was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the proffered negociation, and though this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture acquired ſtrength from the cautious procedure of our government on the occaſion: yet theſe letters, and that proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, have been preſſed upon the public as concluſive evidence, that France had offered, and our government refuſed, to enter into a new treaty of commerce, that would have been highly beneficial to our trade and navigation.</p>

The executive council, therefore, inſtructs Citizen Genet early to ſound the American government on this point, and to make it an indiſpenſable condition of a free trade to the French Weſt Indies, ſo intereſting for the United States to obtain.

                     <p>The ſenate have, however, and, I think, wiſely, conſidered the terms and conditions, on which it is agreed by the 12th article, that we ſhould participate in the trade of the Britiſh Weſt Indies, as leſs liberal than we may, with reaſon, expect— The excluſion of all veſſels above the burden of ſeventy tons, would diminiſh the benefits and value of this trade; and though we cannot calculate upon obtaining by future negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a total removal of a limitation on this ſubject, it is not altogether improbable that a tonnage ſomething larger may be procured.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who are converſant with our preſent intercourſe with the Weſt Indies can beſt determine whether many veſſels under ſeventy tons burden are not, at this time, profitably employed in that trade: it is believed to be true, that previous to our independence, veſſels of this burden were much engaged in that employ as well in the ſouthern as in the eaſtern ſtates.</p>
                     <p>This limitation, though diſadvantageous, is not the ſtrongeſt objection to the 12th article: the reſtraining or regulating of a portion of our trade, which does not proceed from, and is inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of the treaty, forms a more deciſive reaſon againſt the article than any thing elſe that it contains.</p>
                     <p>The cauſe of this reſtraint is found in the commercial jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy and ſpirit of monopoly, which have ſo long reigned over the trade of the colonies—Under our treaty with France and the French colonial laws, it has been ſhown that we could not procure from the French iſlands ſugar, coffee, cocoa, cotton, or any of the other productions, melaſſes and rum excepted.— Great Britain has ſeen it to be compatible with her intereſt to admit us to ſhare more extenſively in the productions of her iſlands; but ſhe has deſired to place limitations on this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. To have left it entirely open and free, would have been to have enable us not only to ſupply ourſelves by means of our own navigation, but to have made it an inſtrument of the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of other nations with her Weſt India productions.</p>
                     <p>When we reflect upon the eſtabliſhed maxims of the colony ſyſtem, and moreover when we conſider, that an entire freedom of trade with the Britiſh Weſt Indies might, at times, mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially raiſe the price of Weſt India productions on the Britiſh conſumers, the ſupply of whom is eſſentially a monopoly in the hands of the Britiſh planters, we ſhall be the leſs inclined to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Great Britain will yield an unreſtrained commerce with her Weſt India poſſeſſions to any nation whatever.</p>

It is very poſſible that the circumſtances of our native cotton's becoming an article of export to foreign markets might not have occurred to our negociator—This would be the leſs extraordinary, as heretofore it has not been cultivated, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in a very limited degree, and as an article of export rather in the manner of experiment than otherwiſe; and, as moreover, from the expenſe and difficulty of ſeparating the ſeeds from the cotton, we have been hardly able hitherto to claſs cotton among our exports. Its cultivation is ſaid latterly to have become an object of attention, in Georgia and South Carolina—ſtill how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it cannot yet be conſidered as a ſtaple commodity—But from the recent ingenious and ſimple machine for ſpinning cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, it is hoped that the cultivation may be extended, ſo that not only our own domeſtic manufactures may be relieved from a dependence on foreign ſupply, but the catalogue of our valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able exports enriched by the addition of this ineſtimable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.</p>
                     <p>In anſwer to the queſtion that has been ſtated: it may be further obſerved, that theſe enumerated articles, though the productions of different territories, being ſo much alike as not eaſily to be diſtinguiſhed, it is probable that the difficulty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>This apprehenſion, however, it is believed, was carried too far; as, on a minute examination of the ſubject it will be found, that our laws relative to drawback, with a few analogous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions in addition, can be made ſufficiently to diſcriminate and identify on re-exportation, all ſuch articles of the growth of the Britiſh iſlands, as may be within our country, and that they will afford the ſame ſecurity for a faithful and exact execution of the prohibition to re-export ſuch articles as that on which our own government relies againſt frauds upon the revenue.

But though the conduct of the ſenate in withholding their aſſent to this article, is conceived, upon the whole, to be well judged and wiſe, yet there were not wanting reaſons of real weight to induce our negociator to agree to it as it ſtands.</p>
                     <p>The inviolability of the principles of the navigation act had become a kind of axiom, incorporated in the habits of thinking of the Britiſh government and nation. Precedent, it is known, has great influence, as well upon the councils as upon the popular opinions of nations!—and there is, perhaps, no country in which it has greater force than that of Great Britain—The precedent of a ſerious and unequivocal innovation upon the ſyſtem of the navigation act, diſſolved as it were the ſpell by which the public prejudices had been chained to it. It took away a mighty argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment derived from the paſt inflexibility of the ſyſtem, and laid the foundation for greater inroads upon opinion, for further and greater innovations in practice. It ſerved to ſtrip the queſtion of every thing that was artificial and to bring it to the ſimple teſt of real national intereſt, to be decided by that beſt of all arbiters, experience.</p>
                     <p>It may, upon this ground, be ſtrongly argued that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent of the privilege gained was of more importance than its immediate extent—an argument certainly of real weight, and which is ſufficient to incline candid men to view the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives that governed our negociator in this particular, with favor, and the opinion to which he yielded with reſpect. It is perhaps not unimportant by way of precedent, that the article, though not eſtabliſhed, is found in the treaty.</p>
                     <p>Though the 12th article, ſo far as reſpects the terms and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the trade to the Britiſh iſlands, forms no part of the treaty, having been excepted, and made the ſubject of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther negociation, it may nevertheleſs be uſeful to take notice of ſome of the many ill-founded objections that have been made againſt it: of this character, is that which aſſerts, that the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of articles, permitted to be carried by us to the Britiſh iſlands, may be abridged at the pleaſure of Great Britain, and ſo the trade may be annihilated.</p>
                     <p>The article ſtipulates that we may carry to any of his majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's iſlands and ports in the Weſt Indies, from the United States, in American veſſels, not exceeding ſeventy tons, any goods or merchandizes "being of the growth, manufacture or production of the ſaid ſtates, <hi>which it is or may be</hi> lawful to carry to the ſaid iſlands, from the ſaid ſtates, in Britiſh veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels;" not all ſuch articles as it is and may be lawful to carry, but in the disjunctive, all ſuch as it is or may be lawful to carry; in other words, all ſuch articles as it is now lawful to carry,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:028389_0636_0FD8EDA6998BC3B0"/>together with ſuch others as hereafter it may be lawful to carry; the catalogue may be enlarged, but cannot be diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It may alſo be remarked incidentally, that this objection ſounds ill in the mouths of thoſe who maintain the eſſentiality of the ſupplies of this country, under all poſſible circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, to the Britiſh Weſt Indies; for if this poſition be true, there never can be reaſonable ground of apprehenſion of too little latitude in the exportation in Britiſh veſſels, which is to be the ſtandard for the exportation in ours.</p>
                     <p>This article has been further criticiſed on account of the adjuſtment of the import and tonnage duties payable in this trade, and it has been attempted to be ſhown that the footing on which we were to ſhare in the ſame would, on this account, be diſadvantageous, and the competition unequal. What is the adjuſtment? The article propoſes that Britiſh veſſels emplo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>Is not this equal? can we expect or aſk Britiſh veſſels ſhould pay an alien tonnage duty in our ports, and that American veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels ſhould enter their ports freely, or on payment only of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive tonnage duties? can we in equity require them to pay, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>But it is added, that our laws impoſe a tonnage duty of ſix cents per ton on the entry of American veſſels engaged in fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign trade, and it is not known that Britiſh veſſels pay any tonnage duty on their entry in their ports in the Weſt Indies— and ſo uniting the two entries, that is, the entry in the Weſt Indies, and the entry on a return to our ports, an American veſſel will pay fifty-ſix cents per ton, when the Britiſh veſſels will pay only fifty cents per ton—If the Britiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment impoſe no tonnage duty on their own veſſels, and we do impoſe a tonnage duty on ours, this certainly cannot form an objection againſt them. They are as free to refrain from the impoſition of a tonnage duty on their own ſhips, as we are to impoſe one on ours—If their policy is wiſer than ours in this reſpect, we are at liberty to adopt it, by repealing the tonnage duty levied on American navigation, which, if we pleaſe, may be confined to the particular caſe; the effect of ſuch a meaſure as far as it ſhould extend, though the duty is ſmall, would be to add a proportionable advantage to our ſhipping in foreign com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition. But the object of the articles in this particular is to equalize, not the duties that each may chooſe to impoſe on their own veſſels, but thoſe that they ſhall impoſe on the veſſels of each other: and in this reſpect the article is perfectly equal— It is perhaps the firſt time that the objection of inequality was founded on a circumſtance depending on the laws of the party affected by it, and removeable at his own option.</p>
                     <p>This view of the ſubject authorizes a belief, that, in the reviſion of the article, a modification of it may be agreed to that will prove ſatisfactory. Indeed, from the ſhort duration of the article, taken in connexion with the expreſſions made uſe of towards the cloſe of it, relative to the renewal of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation, for the purpoſe of ſuch further arrangements as ſhall conduce to the mutual advantage and <hi>extenſion</hi> of this branch of commerce, we may infer that Great Britain contemplates a more enlarged and equal adjuſtment on this point.</p>
                     <p>The relaxations which now exiſt in the colonial ſyſtems, in conſequence of the neceſſities of war, and which will change to our diſadvantage with the return of peace, have been conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by ſome as the permanent ſtate of things. And this error has had its influence in miſleading the public in reſpect to the terms and conditions on which we may reaſonably expect to participate in trade to the Weſt Indies—But let it be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, that the reſtoration of peace will bring with it a reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation

<pb n="65" facs="unknown:028389_0641_0FD8EDB408B17E90"/>for ſale of theſe lands. If is was effected before the ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or at leaſt before the ſignature of the treaty, as much land may be held in this ſtate by Britiſh ſubjects as by Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can citizens. If they were held in truſt, which is highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, the perſon in whoſe favor the truſt was created, is now ſecured from forfeiture, ſince they are to hold "according to the <hi>nature and tenure of their reſpective eſtates and titles," &amp;c.</hi> The Britiſh conſtruction of this article will give them the full be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of their purchaſes; it may then happen, even under the preſent treaty, as it now ſtands, that the greater part of the lands of the two ſtates, at leaſt, belong to Britiſh ſubjects, who may look to their own ſovereign for protection, even againſt the ſtate whoſe lands they hold. What dangers and difficulties may not this expoſe the ſtates to? If it is admitted that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident and ſenate can by treaty ſtipulate without the conſent of a ſtate, that their lands may be held by Britiſh ſubjects, what principle is there in the conſtitution which prevents their making the ſame ſtipulation in favor of the Britiſh king, or their transferring all the vacant lands in every ſtate to him? Theſe were formerly inveſted in him, and I doubt not that if he were to ſet up a claim under this article, that he would find advocates among us to ſupport it. Let it be remembered that the exerciſe of theſe powers by the preſident and ſenate is only derived from an <hi>implication</hi> founded on their right to make treaties. I would aſk, whether a ſtronger implication in favor of an excluſive right in the ſtate governments to make regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions relative to this object, is not found in the third ſection, fourth article of the conſtitution—"<hi>Congreſs</hi> ſhall have the power to diſpoſe of and make all needful rules and regulations reſpecting the territory, or other property of the United States; and nothing in this conſtitution ſhall be ſo conſtrued as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice <hi>any claims</hi> of the United States, or of <hi>any particular ſtates.</hi>" The claim of ſtates to declare the tenure on which their lands ſhall be held, has never been diſputed; and ſo jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous have ſome of them been of it, that they have repeatedly refuſed to admit foreigners to hold lands without naturalization.</p>
                     <p>Several articles, which appear to me exceptionable, remain to be diſcuſſed; but, circumſtances, ariſing from the preſent unhappy ſituation of the city, compel me to lay aſide my pen.

I truſt, however, that enough has been ſaid to ſhow, that the treaty has obtained no adequate compenſation for the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries we have ſuffered.

                     <p>No! No! "Camillus"—your <hi>"great, good, and dear friend,"</hi> is too much occupied with his neighbours on the other ſide the channel, to find time to attend to us—Like the bear who was ſurrounded by hornets, he is too buſy to be attracted by any thing at a diſtance. The plethora of his body politic has been too much reduced by the French bayonet, to be in vigor-to attack men who once treated him ſo roughly. We fear him not—we want no <hi>proxies</hi> to fight our battles; and if <hi>your</hi> nerves are too weak, or your reverence for majeſty too great, ceaſe your attempts to communicate your weakneſſes to the athletic freemen of America. Confine your ſeductions to your preſent circle; for by keeping them within thoſe limits, you may eſcape, for a time, the contempt and deteſtation which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace you.</p>
                     <p>But if war is ſuch a dreadful calamity, ſo much to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precated, that the phantoms of it alone unſtring the cob-web nerves of "Camillus," what will be our condition, when the griſly monſter Mars, arrayed in all his terrors, ruſhes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the injuries and perfidies done to the French republic? Does he ſuppoſe, that war can become an evil only when waged againſt his idol, Great Britain? Would the part which we ſhould take in the league of deſpots, ſhould the treaty ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, ſoften the horrors or mitigate the diſtreſſes of war? Would a war with the French republic prop <hi>a funding ſyſtem,</hi> that he ſeems ſo careleſs about it? Should his baſtard be legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timized, there can be little doubt, that France would conſider it as an infraction of our neutrality, as a ſuperceſſion of our engagements with her, and as a virtual, though not formal, acceſſion to the confederacy of tyrants againſt her. Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, my fellow citizens, will juſtify the ſuſpicion, that a war with the French republic would be conſidered as a thing devoutly to be wiſhed by Camillus and his friends, and that the treaty was formed with a ſolicitude for that event. There ſeems to have been a deliberate plan to exterminate liberty, and this was to have been effected by throwing off the connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion with France, and conſolidating ourſelves with Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.—In the arms of deſpotiſm, liberty would have been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focated; and in the arms of a Britiſh tyrant her fate would have been inevitable.</p>
                     <p>The increaſe of affection for France, in the breaſts of the American citizens, <hi>ſince ſhe became a republic,</hi> ſeems to have produced a ſerious alarm among the <hi>Ariſtocratic faction</hi> of the United States; and hence the repugnance to treat with her
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:028389_0646_0FD8EDBE84DF5850"/>anew—hence the Machiavelian conſtruction of every thing which was due to her—and hence the ſolicitude to form the unnatural alliance that has manifeſted itſelf in the treaty. That the government of the United States has been making rapid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrides towards ariſtocracy, no unprejudiced man, at this time of day, will deny; and that a connexion with Great Britain was ſought for, to facilitate this object, no one, who has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed the ſteps of our adminiſtration, and has read the treaty, unbiaſſed by party ſpirit, will controvert. If there was not an <hi>extraordinary</hi> predilection for Great Britain, would the United States have been paſſive under the many outrages they have ſuſtained—would they have ſuffered, in ſilence, their ſeamen to be impreſſed, like ſlaves, on board Britiſh ſhips of war, and would they have beheld the unparalleled inſult, without emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that has been offered to our nation, in the attempt to ſeize a miniſter of France, within the limits of our own terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory!! Heaven, earth, and hell, would have been conjured, if an attempt of the ſort had been made upon the miniſter of Great Britain: and yet thoſe fiends are by treaty <q>to be treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that reſpect which is due to the commiſſions which they bear; and if any inſult ſhould be offered to them, be any of the inhabitants, all offenders, in this reſpect, ſhall be puniſhed as diſturbers of the peace and amity between the two countries</q>!!</p>
                     <p>Fellow citizens, I have digreſſed from the treaty; but you will think it excuſable, as you know the cauſe; for the man who can behold the bare-faced attempts upon our rights, and the audacious outrages upon our country, without the ſtrongeſt emotions, is unworthy of the freedom and inheritance of the revolution.</p>

                     <p>A SOLEMN, an awful ſilence pervades the world of American politics, portentive of ſome great event. The ſignature, the unexpected ſignature of the preſident to the treaty, has momentarily paralized the American mind, as if by etherial impulſe; and it has not yet recovered from the incubus of aſtoniſhment and grief, with which it was oppreſſed. The omnipotence of truth will, however, at laſt prevail; and though the Americans are grateful, they are juſt; and that
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:028389_0647_0FD8EDC377283570"/>ſenſe of juſtice will prevent a barter of their own rights and their own happineſs for the gratification of any individual, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever high his <hi>own</hi> claim to an unlimited contrul over his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The conflict of jarring feelings, the ſtrife between grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and ſelf-love, has, for a moment, ſuſpended the voice of injured freemen; but the feeble mound of gratitude will not long reſiſt the impetuous and imperious cataract of ſelf-preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.—Gratitude! What means it when in contact with poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical juſtice! What means it, when thrown in the oppoſite balance of our happineſs! Does an individual claim more feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than ourſelves, our families, our country! Does he demand ſentiments in hoſtility to our own repoſe! Human nature muſt undergo a revolution before this can come to paſs, and virtue yield its throne to vice.</p>
                     <p>The ſervices of the preſident, during the revolution, are decked in all their charms, to ſeduce us from a queſtion of his preſent motives. He is held up to us as the high prieſt of liberty, to give abſolution to our own ſenſations. The amiable virtue, gratitude, is appealed to in our boſoms, to neutralize our indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, at his having ſigned the treaty, <hi>after the general ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his country had been made known to him, in oppoſition to it.</hi> Had his ſignature been given immediately after the adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſenate, and before an univerſal expreſſion of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approbation of it had taken place, ingenuity might have found a cover for him; but the public mind ſeems to have been deſignedly wrought up to the higheſt key of expectation, that the contempt of it might be more ſtrongly diſcloſed. Is grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to put a ſeal upon our lips under ſuch circumſtances? Are freemen to be treated with the moſt marked contumely, and to be paſſive under it like ſlaves? Is the preſident to receive more reverence than our conſtitution, and more devotion than liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty! Let us be conſiſtent, and either renounce our conſtitution, and our pretenſions to freedom, or rally round them in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to the will of an individual. I will endeavour to prove to you, my fellow citizens, in the courſe of theſe letters, that our conſtitution has been totally diſregarded, and that the preſident has ſubſtituted his will, for the will of the people— that he has thwarted the affections of the people, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of their attachment to the republic of France, and aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from Great Britain, has deceived the one, and crouched to the other. If gratitude is due to the preſident, has not France like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a claim to it? Shall <hi>he</hi> prove ungrateful to her, and <hi>we</hi> prove grateful to him? Shall he practice deception upon the beſt friend of our country, a friend to whoſe generous aid he owes his preſent greatneſs,—and ſhall we prove perfidious
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:028389_0648_0FD8EDC48BAD9BD8"/>enough to give it our countenance? Shall he take Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain into his boſom, Great Britain who ſought to enſlave us, who has been guilty of every baſeneſs and every outrage againſt us, and ſhall we be obliged to ſmile upon the monſter, and receive the kiſs of Judas? Shall he greet the tyrant George, as his <hi>"great, good, and dear friend;"</hi> and ſhall we be obliged to recognize ſuch ſacrilege of liberty? Shall he colonize us anew, and ſhall we be obliged to ſubſcribe the ſhameful compact? Shall that independence, which he aſſiſted to eſtabliſh, be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by him at the feet of Great Britain—ſhall that conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ſacred bond of union and dear bought inheritance of the revolution, be trampled under foot by him, and gratitude ſtill be chaunted in our ears? Was the revolution deſigned to make him a monarch, and a few ſpeculators noblemen! Is this the gratitude that is demanded? Are we to eſtabliſh a political infallibility, and conſecrate a political pope in our country? Is it longer to continue impious to arraign preſidential meaſures?

                     <p>TO expatiate on the juſtice, power, and reſources of Great-Britain—to juſtify all her acts, however wanton and unjuſt—to depreciate his own country, and to place her in the wrong upon every occaſion, are favourite themes with CAMILLUS. Hence it was no matter of ſurprize to find him in his third number, attempting a formal vindication of Great-Britain for carrying away the negroes, and ridiculing our claim, on that ſubject. As this is the firſt number that contains any thing like argument, it ought not to paſs unnoticed. By the treaty of Paris, his Britannic majeſty agreed "not to carry away any negroes from the United States." This, ſays Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus, muſt mean either negroes which <hi>had been,</hi> or which at the ceſſation of hoſtilities <hi>continued to be</hi> American proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. When the meaning of an inſtrument is doubtful, there cannot be a ſafer or fairer way to obtain its true ſenſe, than by conſidering its circumſtances, and the views of the parties at the time of making the contract, and that they acted with good faith to each other. To apply this rule; during the late war, many negroes had been taken by, or had voluntarily joined the armies or gone into the garriſons of Great-Britain. To reclaim them, and prevent their being carried away, was an object which our commiſſioners had much at heart; and it is not eaſy to conceive how this object could have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in plainer or leſs ambiguous terms. It will be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, that Franklin had an agency in that treaty; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps no man ever excelled him in perſpicuity and pertinency of expreſſion; that thoſe negroes and thoſe alone were in the contemplation of both parties, reſults from the very nature of the caſe. It could not be neceſſary to guard againſt new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations of this kind—peace being made, all hoſtilities of every kind ceaſed. As well might a clauſe have been inſerted, to prohibit ſhips of war, of the different parties, from making
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:028389_0652_0FD8EDCF07BEA2B0"/>prizes during the peace; as the captains of ſuch veſſels would have been treated like pirates, ſo might every negro, or his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, been recovered by a regular courſe of law, from any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who had taken him after the peace, without any ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the treaty for that purpoſe. To confine this article, therefore, to an engagement to abſtain from further plunder, is rendering it altogether negative and uſeleſs; which is never to be ſuppoſed, and cannot be preſumed to have been the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of either party. The reaſoning of Camillus is conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and contradictory; in one breath, he likens the negroes to "horſes, cattle, and other moveables, and as ſuch liable to become booty;" in the next conſidering them "as rational beings, and as entitled to liberty under Britiſh proclamations, he concludes it would have been <hi>odious</hi> and <hi>immoral</hi> to let them paſs again into ſlavery." Let us beſtow a moment, for a moment will ſuffice, to detect the ſophiſtry of each of theſe arguments.</p>
                     <p>Admitting that ſlaves may become booty, and that their property becomes veſted in the captor, has he not a right to reſtore them, if he pleaſes, at a peace? did not this city belong to the king of Great-Britain by conqueſt? and did he not agree to evacuate it, rather than continue an unequal war? did not the American artillery, which he found in our forts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to him by the ſame right; yet he agreed to leave it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind? when he finds how ably his infractions of the treaty are defended by our own citizens, he will, no doubt, regret that he evacuated New-York as ſoon as he did; for the ſame argument <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>d by Camillus to juſtify his detention of the weſtern poſts, would apply equally ſtrong to his having kept garriſons till this time in our ſea-ports, the prompt evacuation of which this writer conſiders rather as a matter of grace in his majeſty, than of ſtrict obligation on his part. To return—as the negroes which were taken, belonged to the king, he might prefer reſtoring them to their former owners, rather than be encumbered with their maintenance, which would probably have been the conſequence of giving them freedom; to have ſold them, would have ill comported with his dignity. It muſt be conſidered alſo, that in reſtoring them to their maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he would take care to receive an equivalent for ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. What this equivalent was, none but the commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers can know; perhaps they agreed to <hi>recommend</hi> the tories to mercy in conſideration of his majeſty's reſtoring the negroes: whatever the inducement may have been, he promiſes, by an expreſſion as latitudinary as can well be deviſed, not to carry
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:028389_0653_0FD8EDD2CB005478"/>away <hi>any</hi> of them, that is, he will leave them <hi>all</hi> whether ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by capture or enticed away by his royal offers. If an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception had been intended, in favor of any claſs, it would have found its way into the treaty: none being made, the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt either be nugatory, or extend to all the blacks, who were then living, and in the power of his troops, arming them againſt their maſters, and not in making amends for ſuch an abominable warfare, by ſending them home again. But if ſuch promiſes were really made, or if a treaty of amity and alliance, offenſive and defenſive, actually exiſted between his Britannic majeſty, and who had not been actually carried from the continent before the treaty, the other poſition cannot be ſupported without charging the king with the greateſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and want of good faith, which I ſhall not offend Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus ſo much as to ſuppoſe his majeſty capable of. It would be odious and immoral, ſays he, to return to their former maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, negroes who had joined them on a promiſe of liberty. Any other but Camillus would have thought the immorality conſiſted in alluring away the ſwarthy domeſtics of America. Why not be explicit, and explain with good faith, to the ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentiaries, the ſolemn engagement he was under; inſtead of ſtipulating a ſpecific return, an equivalent might then have been agreed upon; or if faith muſt be broken, either with the negroes, or with the United States, would it not have been a leſs reflection on Great-Britain, to give up the former, whom ſhe was no longer able to protect, (as ſhe did the tories) and to whom ſhe was probably under no other than immoral en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, contained in proclamations, iſſued upon the ſole authority of ſome ſavage officers, than to break, in the very moment of ſigning, a ſolemn compact, formally and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately entered into with the latter? was ſhe not under as ſolemn engagements to the tories who had eſpouſed her cauſe, and received protections from her generals; yet their perſons and properties were abandoned, or, which was the ſame thing, placed upon the precarious footing of a recommendation on the part of congreſs, for favor and pardon to the legiſlatures of the different ſtates. Not a man of this deſcription who had been baniſhed, could return without a law for the purpoſe. Does Camillus imagine that the intereſts of theſe Africans lay nearer the heart of their gracious monarch, whoſe virtues and humanity he takes ſo much pleaſure in blazoning, than thoſe of his own deluded ſubjects, who, notwithſtanding his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate ſacrifice of them, continue as firmly as ever devoted to him.</p>

                        </gap>ected by it, or when the United States, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his unbounded affection for them) are alone injured by it.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon, then, as the Britiſh king found that his recent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements with this country could not be executed ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally without violating his antecedent promiſes to the negroes, inſtead of quibbling, and putting on his agreement a conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which rendered it a <hi>dead letter,</hi> he would have acted more conſiſtent with the character aſcribed to him by the friends of the preſent treaty, by candidly communicating his embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to our government. We ſhould readily have conſented to a pecuniary compenſation; Camillus, it is true, aſſerts, that "when a party promiſes a ſpecific thing, nothing but the thing itſelf will ſatisfy the promiſe."—If Camillus be a lawyer, he certainly knows that nothing is more common than a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in damages for the breach of a promiſe to do a ſpecific thing; and that in a great variety of caſes it is the only ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to which the law can or will compel the deliquent party; and that ſuch damages being paid, the promiſe is as completely ſatisfied as by doing of the ſpecific thing. Thus, if a perſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract to deliver me a ſhip, or a horſe which he afterwards ſells to another, or to come nearer to the caſe before us, he engages to reſtore me a negro which he afterwards ſends away, and thus puts a ſpecific performance out of his power, my only claim againſt him is for a compenſation commenſurate to the injury ſuſtained by his breach of promiſe. It would be abſurd in the extreme for America, at this time, to inſiſt upon a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of thoſe negroes. Many are dead; and of thoſe who ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive, the greater part muſt be in the decline of life, and would be of little uſe to their former maſters. A compenſation then is all that can be aſked; this is preciſely the controverſy between the two governments. The United States (and Camillus will not contend againſt their right ſo to do) releaſe G. Britain from
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:028389_0655_0FD8EDD5CFF84990"/>a ſpecific compliance, and inſiſt upon an equivalent in money. With what other view, then, but to deceive, does Camillus ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that "the party to whom a promiſe is made, cannot be required to accept in lieu of in an equivalent? Did he not know that the United States were willing to receive, and aſked for nothing more than an equivalent, ſo that there could be no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of enquiring into the right of Great-Britain to force them to it?</p>
                     <p>It is proper to ſubjoin, that the conſtruction of this article by Camillus, is oppoſed to the interpretation which our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment have uniformly put upon it, is contrary to the expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of it by mr. Jefferſon, whoſe correſpondence with mr. Hammond is recommended, as the beſt antidote againſt the miſchievous and humiliating doctrines, ſo warmly inculcated by this writer. Every American will turn with pleaſure from a laboured panegyric of the Britiſh government, a ſtrenuous and uncandid vindication of all its arbitrary proceedings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this country, and from the degrading repreſentation of the United States, which fill ſo many columns of Camillus, to the manly, energetic, dignified, and yet candid examination of Jefferſon. In the writings of this invaluable ſtateſman, he will diſcover the true ſource of controverſy between the two coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. He will be ſhocked at the perfidy and duplicity of Great-Britain, and will be aſtoniſhed at the forbearance of the United States, under the moſt aggravated and unprovoked inſults and injuries. It is a work which ſhould be in the hands of every man. It will teach us to love and reſpect our country, a duty which cannot be too ſtrongly inculcated, when pains are taken to infuſe a contrary ſentiment.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall only aſk, if Camillus is right, how happened it, that a majority of the Senate, at their late ſeſſion, agreed to adviſe the Preſident to renew negociations with his majeſty for a compenſation for the negroes who had been carried away con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the 7th article of the treaty of peace? When ſo many reſpectable authorities concur reſpecting this aggreſſion, it would evince a becoming modeſty in Camillus to retract an opinion which ought to find advocates only in the Britiſh Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net.</p>

Their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs was proportionate to their malice. America being unable to extend her protection to an immenſe frontier, her citizens were driven from their farms—their property made a prey of; and they deemed themſelves happy, when they could eſcape from aſſaſſination into exile and penury. Our ſeas and coaſts ſwarmed with privateers, fitted out by theſe internal enemies; and even the Indians of America were piloted by them, to the peaceful dwellings of her citizens, and female and infants' ſcalps were often diſplayed as the joint triumph of thoſe mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the human race! Who then can be aſtoniſhed, that theſe provocations, which were repeating every day, ſhould excite the moſt lively ſenſations of indignation and reſentment? Who then can wonder, that our legiſlature ſhould paſs an act, which was not only extorted by a ſenſe of injury, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igencies of the times, but was peculiarly calculated to protect our c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Forgive me, ſir, if I deſcribe your preſent friends in glowing colours. Humanity wiſhed to forget forever, deeds of cruelty and horror, at the bare men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which, the moſt obdurate and rugged heart rovolts. America was content to drop the curtain on a tragedy, the cataſtrophe of which had confounded the adverſaries of her freedom and ſovereignty. This ſtate in particular, [New-York] although her trade and frontiers had ſuffered the moſt, early manifeſted a conciliating and forgiving ſpirit. Perſons who had betrayed the moſt rancorous temper, and had been ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for their enmity and <hi>poverty</hi> of ſpirit, were permitted to return to the boſom of their offended country. Men who had evidenced not only in principle, but in action, the moſt rooted hoſtility to our freedom and government, were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to remain, and to become a part of the great body politic. Inſtances, without number, of forbearance, lenity, and even of tenderneſs, forgiveneſs, and ſincere reconciliation, might be produced; even rewards and public honors and offices have been beſtowed on theſe men. Far from condemning a policy, to which, however, there were many objections, I glory in the liberality and munificence of my country. Nor was it my wiſh to reſcue from oblivion, a memorial of the conduct of thoſe who have been objects of their country's generoſity and forgiveneſs. Camillus has courted, nay provoked the diſcuſſion. When it becomes neceſſary to exculpate our country from the reproach of cruelty and breach of ſaith, we muſt be permitted
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:028389_0658_0FD8EDDE0653FAD8"/>to return to the times which produced the act, which, it is pretended, fixes this ſtigma upon her. If Camillus had taken this trouble, he would have ſeen ſo much room for recrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that in tenderneſs to the feelings of theſe unhappy men, he would have forborne ſome of his ſevere animadverſions on the conduct of this ſtate.</p>
                     <p>Having ſtated ſome of the provocations and inducements, we come now to the law itſelf, in which Camillus diſcerns one of the earlieſt breaches of the treaty of peace, on our part; Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus was not more unhappy in reminding us of the conduct of the tories, than he is unfortunate in this firſt proof which lie inſtances of our breach of faith. The law to which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, is well known by the appellation of the treſpaſs act. This law paſſed the 17th March, 1783. A mind, not warped by prejudice, nor diſpoſed to deceive itſelf, is at ſome difficulty to imagine how an act, paſſed ſix months before the definitive treaty was ſigned, and more than a year, according to Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, before it became binding on the king, can be tortured in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an infraction of that very treaty. At the time of paſſing this law, the legiſlature had a perfect right ſo to do; nay, it was part of their duty,—the war yet raged with unabated ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor: as the royal cauſe became more and more deſperate, its friends became proportionably alert in their efforts to revenge a ſucceſs, to which they could not reconcile themſelves. Their laſt cruelties exceeded any of a former date. Every meaſure therefore, which tended to curb the licentiouſneſs of our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic foes, to mitigate or check the horrors of a civil war, and to protect thoſe of our citizens whoſe remote reſidence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented their receiving any adequate ſecurity from the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can army, was not only prudent, but neceſſary, juſtifiable, and humane. It was alſo believed, that few, if any, of the depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and robberies, which were committed by the new levies and refugees, were at the time ſanctioned by any military or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; their own fury, and a thirſt for plunder and revenge led them on; yet if a military order was admitted to juſtify their conduct, how eaſy would it have been to obtain one? Every man who had ſtolen a horſe, a cow, or other property, without any authority, and converted the proceeds to his own uſe (and there were thouſands who purſued no other buſineſs) would have ſheltered himſelf from a juſt compenſation, under an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which might at any time have been procured.

                     <p>Camillus, it is true, does not admit that treaties, made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the confederation, were paramount to the antecedent laws of the ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>e does not flatly deny the poſition, but contents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with obſerving, that it was a "queſtion of <hi>theory,</hi> about which there was room for, and in this country did exiſt, much diverſity of opinion." What is meant by any law being a queſtion of theory, I do not well comprehend. What is the law in any particular caſe, in a foreign country, we have ever been taught to conſider a queſtion of <hi>fact</hi> and not of theory; and lord Mansfield declares, that ſuch laws muſt be proved <hi>as facts.</hi> What the law may be, in any given caſe, may be a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of uncertainty, and not known to every one, but it is ſtill a queſtion of fact, whether it be, as ſtated by one perſon or another. Where this diverſity of opinion prevails, courts of juſtice alone can ſettle the queſtion; and until this is done, we muſt reſort, for information, to our national engagements, and the opinions of profeſſional men. I do not mean to admit, that our courts have not determined the queſtion; for it will be ſeen in the ſequel, (and it is ſomewhat myſterious that it ſhould have eſcaped the penetration of Camillus) that our courts have ſolemnly adjudged in favour of the treaty, when interfering with a contrary municipal regulation.</p>
                     <p>The queſtion deſerves a more minute examination; for if it can be ſhown, that all ſtate laws, contravening the treaty of peace, were thereby repealed, and rendered null as to their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture operation, all the elaborate reaſoning of Camillus, and its ſuperſtructure, will be overthrown, and he himſelf be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, however reluctantly, to impute the firſt infraction to the account of Great-Britain. The propoſition is ſo ſelf-evident to an American lawyer, that without any proof, it forces the ſame conviction on his mind, as the plaineſt axioms of Euclid, "that the whole is greater than a part," or, "that all right angles are equal to one another," do upon that of a mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician. To prove either, appears a work of ſupererogation; however, as the doubt is raiſed, we will attempt a ſolution of it.</p>
                     <p>By the 9th article of the confederation, "the United State; in congreſs aſſembled, have the <hi>ſole</hi> and <hi>excluſive</hi> right of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into treaties and alliances." Theſe articles were acceded
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:028389_0660_0FD8EDE4C3831410"/>to by this ſtate, by a ſolemn act of its legiſlature, paſſed the 6th of February, 1778. The people, therefore, of this ſtate were as much parties to the treaty of Paris, as if they had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in their proper perſons, and individually affixed their ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natures to it. How then could its binding force upon them ever become a queſtion? Has Great-Britain ever entertained a doubt on the ſubject? Can one party to a contract annul it without the other's conſent? Hence it follows, not only that treaties made under the confederation, were ſupreme laws of the land, but that they were ſo in a ſenſe much more exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and emphatical than could be applied to an act of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature. While the latter could be repealed or altered, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer could no wiſe be effected by a legiſlative act. Of little force, therefore, is the obſervation of Camillus, that "in the opinion of the legiſlature of Virginia, there were acts which had prevented, and might prevent the recovery of debts, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the treaty." The legiſlature of Virginia may make, but cannot expound even its own laws, much leſs laws or compacts to which that ſtate was only <hi>one</hi> of <hi>many</hi> parties. Their expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion belongs ſolely and excluſively to the judicial department. Theſe (but perhaps it was unknown to Camillus) are the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the legiſlature of that very ſtate. In an act of October, 1787, it is declared, "that it does not belong to the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to decide particular queſtions, of which the judiciary have cognizance, and that therefore it was unfit for them to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine on the validity of certain payments." The opinion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, of any legiſlature on laws which already exiſt, is entitled to no attention; much leſs does ſuch an opinion diminiſh the obligation or efficacy of them. Even in paſſing laws, if they exceed their authority (which may be the caſe) courts of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice will diſregard and refuſe to carry them into effect. If a caſe had been cited, of the ſupreme judicial tribunal of Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia rendering a judgment conformable to what is ſtared as the opinion of its legiſlature, it would have been in point, and not eaſy to reconcile to the injunctions of the treaty.</p>
                     <p>After producing this opinion, Camillus demands, with an air of triumph and ſatisfaction, as if he had detected mr. Jeffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in a miſrepreſentation; "with what truth has it been aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it was at all times perfectly underſtood, that treaties controuled the laws of the ſtates? I anſwer, becauſe it could not be otherwiſe, and that not only mr. Jefferſon, but ſeveral profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional and other characters of eminence, whom he conſulted, (for extenſive as his own experience was, he did not think it derogated from a miniſter of a free nation to collect informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:028389_0661_0FD8EDE68AD78EF8"/>from his fellow citizens) concurred in this opinion. It may well be doubted, whether any lawyer has ever ſeriouſly advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated a contrary propoſition. "It reſulted," ſays mr. Jeffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, "from the inſtrument of confederation, among the ſtates, that treaties made by congreſs, according to the confederation, were ſuperior to the laws of the ſtates." He adds, "we may ſafely affirm this to have been the general ſenſe of thoſe at leaſt who were of the profeſſion of the law." Mr. Jefferſon, we ſhall ſee, did not ſpeak at random, nor without authority, nor is he chargeable with the ſmalleſt miſrepreſentation. It gives me pleaſure, I confeſs, to reſcue the character of this gentleman, which has forced the admiration of America, from the aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of an anonimous writer, whoſe lucubrations hitherto may be regarded rather as a formal cenſure of his official conduct, than a vindication of the Engliſh treaty. Does it excite ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, that Camillus wiſhes to render him odious? In his own writings the reaſon may be diſcovered. "Mr. Jefferſon," ſays he, "is a candidate for the preſidential chair!"</p>
                     <p>Governor Collins, mr. Channing, diſtrict attorney for Rhode-Iſland, governor Huntington, mr. Lewis, diſtrict attorney for Pennſylvania, mr. Monroe, a ſenator from Virginia, and now miniſter in France, and mr. Harriſon, our diſtrict attorney, and a gentleman of well learned legal reputation, have all ſanctioned an opinion, which Camillus would fain perſuade us is a matter of doubt. The name of Hamilton, whoſe legal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirements, and other ſplendid talents, have ſo often aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his fellow citizens, and whoſe authority it is preſumed, will not be diſputed by Camillus, may alſo be added to a liſt already reſpectable. In the caſe of Waddington and Rutgers, which has been oftener mentioned than its importance deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, he was council for the defendant, and adviſed his client to rely on the treaty of peace, which plea was allowed by the court. It will not be impertinent here to notice a remark of Camillus, not as a proof of candour, but of his ſolicitude to miſlead: "though," ſays he, "there may have been no formal deciſion of <hi>our</hi> courts, enforcing the exceptionable principles of the treſpaſs act, yet there never was a deciſon of a ſupreme court againſt it." Did not Camillus know, that the ſupreme court had decided againſt principles as exceptionable in other acts, merely becauſe they were at war with the treaty of peace? He knew it, and it would have been no reflection on his candour to have ſtated the inſtances. Not having done ſo, the following extract of a letter from mr. Harriſon to mr. Jefferſon, will remind him of ſome caſes in which he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably

Among the ſubterfuges, calculated to fix a reproach upon the United States, may be claſſed the remark of Camillus, that, "under the confederation, they had no courts of their own to expound and enforce their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as laws." We are at a loſs which to cenſure moſt in this obſervation; its want of candour, or the unqualified reflection it carries with it on the ſtate judiciaries. If treaties were laws of the land, which, perhaps, was never ſeriouſly doubted, were not the ſtate judges, then, as much as the federal judges are now, ſworn and bound to conform to, and make them the rule of their deciſions? He ſubjoins, with becoming delicacy, "it was believed that a majority of our ſupreme court bench would over-rule the plea of a military order." How was this diſcovery made? did the judges favour him with an extra-judicial opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion? or was he gifted with the ſpirit of divination? Thus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, ſurmiſes, and ſuſpicions muſt be reſorted to, to fix upon our ſtate, the ignominious charge of breaking her ſolemn enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

To the credit of our bench, it ought to be mentioned, that it has, ever ſince the peace, been filled with characters of the moſt unblemiſhed reputation and integrity, and that the confidence inſpired by their deciſions, has been ſo great, that perhaps in no ſtate in the union, is leſs buſineſs done in the federal court, than in New-York. It would hardly receive credit, was I to mention how very few civil actions have been commenced in theſe courts, ſince their organization in this ſtate.</p>
                     <p>It cannot be neceſſary to follow Camillus through his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidious enumeration of the other acts of this, and other ſtates, which he conſiders as violations of the treaty; the ſame anſwer applies to all.

                        </gap>; but it is alleged, that in ſome caſes, repealing acts were deemed neceſſary by the legiſlatures of the different ſtates. This does not alter the caſe.

                     <p>IF Camillus, inſtead of vindicating mr. Jay, at the expenſe of his country's faith, had recurred to his official reports, while ſecretary for foreign affairs, an apology would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented itſelf, not quite ſo grateful perhaps to the pride of his friend; but leſs conſtrained, and more agreeable to truth, than the one which he has aſſigned. It is well known that mr. Jay, while at the head of that department, either from want of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, or from taking a leſs comprehenſive view of the ſubject than his ſucceſſor did, or from ſome other leſs pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able motive, in very unqualified language, not only excuſed Great-Britain for her infraction of the treaty, but threw the whole cenſure on this country. It was eaſily foreſeen that the negociation in the hands of a man, thus committed, muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:028389_0666_0FD8EDF3F39CF3A0"/>prove abortive, or terminate, as it has done, diſhonorably to America. A virtuous minority in the Senate, remonſtrated in vain againſt an appointment which was not only a direct attack upon the conſtitution, by deſtroying the independence of the judiciary, but which, from the character of the envoy, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured nothing but diſappointment and ignominy. Mr. Jay's hoſtility to the French revolution was alſo well known. This enmity betrayed itſelf, not only in his more private ſentiments and converſation, but was moſt conſpicuouſly diſplayed in the libel, which he, in concert with one of our ſenators, publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt againſt the miniſter of that republic. The manifeſt object of that too-celebrated certificate was to diſcredit the French cauſe, and to extinguiſh that enthuſiaſtic ardour for its ſucceſs, which had become almoſt univerſal in the United States. The attack upon mr. Genet terminated unfortunately and diſrepu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably for the contrivers of it: it was not therefore to be expected that a man (whoſe very friends impute to him, a temper border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the vindictive) ſhould over forgive the triumph of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, who not only exonerated himſelf from the charge, but in a manner the moſt public and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> equivocal, convicted his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſts of having propagated a deliberate miſrepreſentation. It will be recollected, that mr. Jay's <hi>own</hi> witneſs proved the innocence of mr. Genet. What could America look for from an envoy, whoſe mind had been recently embittered againſt the French, by a perſonal defeat, but as many marks of animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity towards that people as could decently be inſerted in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic treaty. Theſe obſervations may at firſt appear impertinent, and no wiſe connected with the merits of the treaty; but when Camillus, and every other writer in favor of it, uniformly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent mr. Jay as the propereſt man in America to have been entruſted with the negociation, and hence infer that it cannot be bad, it becomes uſeful to examine the poſition, and to ſhow, as has been done, that a more unfit character could not have been ſent upon ſo important an embaſſy.</p>
                     <p>It may be ſaid, the documents afterwards collected by the induſtry of mr. Jefferſon, and his maſterly reaſoning upon them, placed the queſtions, which had been conceded by mr. Jay, in a light which diſſipated all objections, and carried con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction to every unprejudiced mind. That mr. Jay, therefore, would have nothing to do but to bring forward the arguments which had already been managed with ſo much ſucceſs by the American ſecretary. But thoſe who reaſon in this way, forget how difficult it is for a man who ſtands committed on record, to renounce his errors. From pride of opinion, and inordinate
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:028389_0667_0FD8EDF6C3928D00"/>ſelf-eſteem, no one is exempt; how then were we to hope that mr. Jay, after hazarding opinions on this ſide of the Atlantic, which had already proved the bane of his country, in all her ſubſequent negociations with Great-Britain, ſhould recede im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately on his arrival at the court of St. James's, where every pains and flattery would be practiſed, to keep him in good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour? Beſides, his ſentiments being in poſſeſſion of the Britiſh miniſter, might be uſed to great advantage, if he attempted to change his ground. Rather, therefore, than recede at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe of his reputation, and at a certainty of being ſelf-convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of contradiction and inconſiſtency, every ſubtility and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe would be put in uſe, and in the laſt reſort, the intereſts of America would be regarded as a ſmall ſacrifice to perſonal honor. The envoy well knew, that however important theſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices might be, men would not be wanting to applaud the wicked deed, and to blazen to the world his paſt ſervices and patriotiſm. The event has correſponded with his expectations. Inſtead of declaring, which would have been the language of ſincerity and candor, that it was impoſſible for mr. Jay, who was already committed, to invite a diſcuſſion with the Britiſh ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet, every deception is practiſed to impoſe upon the public, a belief that ſuch diſcuſſion, in the hands of any one, muſt have been inauſpicious to the United States, and the efforts of mr. Jefferſon, to reſcue us from the baſe imputation of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor in office, are contemptuouſly ſtiled "a mere eſſay of polemical ſkill, or a convenient ingredient of negociation."</p>
                     <p>Citizens of America! be on your guard. Since the epoch of your independence, a more important criſis than the preſent, never preſented itſelf. To entice you into an approbation of a compact too degrading to be vindicated, arts, as baſe as the inſtrument itſelf, are put in practice—your confidence in a miniſter, who never ceaſed to defend your rights, and who was forced from his high ſtation by the prevalence of a Britiſh faction, is attempted to be ſhaken. His manly and energetic expoſition of your violated rights is turned into ridicule—his candor is impeached, and his patriotic labours in your ſervice are branded as the offspring of "hollowneſs and fallacy." Men, like theſe, are, if you follow the pernicious counſel of Camillus, to be "expelled from your confidence." Theſe are the men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom you are cautioned, as laying "artful ſnares for your peace !" Are unſupported ſuggeſtions, like theſe, the effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of patriotiſm and virtue? Do they not betray, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding a thouſand profeſſions to the contrary, a mind hoſtile to your internal peace, and tainted with the corruptions of a
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:028389_0668_0FD8EDFB82DC2D80"/>Bitiſh court! If you purſue ſuch intemperate advice, and expel from your confidence, men of the deſcription glanced at by Camillus, where will the expulſion end? a proſcription more dreadful than that of Robeſpierre will ſucceed. The firſt and beſt patriots of America will fall victims, and all to gratify the inſatiable ambition of a few aſpiring individuals, who can brook no oppoſition, and unleſs they can controul public af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, are perpetually diſſeminating calumnies, and ſowing the ſeeds of civil diſſention and diſcord. This is remarkably the caſe with the writer, whoſe defence, as it is hitherto ludicrouſly termed, has occaſioned theſe remarks. His preliminary obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, and but little elſe has yet appeared in his firſt ſix numbers, are calculated to impreſs a belief, that an oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the treaty originated with the <hi>perſonal enemies</hi> of mr. Jay, or with thoſe who have been uniformly oppoſed to the general government. Theſe remarks partake more of intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and illiberality than of argument. As an addreſs to the paſſions, they may be overlooked, but if they are deſigned to convince our reaſon, we turn from them with pity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. What, ſir, are the perſonal enemies of mr. Jay diſperſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from one end of the continent to the other? Many reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table names, who ſtand foremoſt in the oppoſition, are, or have been, his friends. They regret the wounds which his feelings muſt ſuſtain by their oppoſition to an aſſociation in which he has borne ſo conſpicuous a part; but the calls of patriotiſm have ſtifled thoſe of friendſhip, and it is a circumſtance, certainly not favourable to the treaty, that many men, who had been in the habits of intimacy, and of thinking well of mr. Jay, have been moſt undiſguiſed in their expreſſions againſt it. That mr. Jay has his perſonal enemies, is not doubted; no man is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them; and perhaps it would be difficult to aſſign any good reaſon why he ſhould be exempt from this common lot of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity: but that theſe enemies have invariably arrayed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the banners of oppoſition, remains for Camillus to prove.</p>
                     <p>The other aſſertion is leſs excuſable, becauſe Camillus well knew, that among thoſe who oppoſed the treaty, were ſome of the beſt friends to the national government; ſome who had not only ſigned, but had ever warmly ſupported the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the United States. The names of Langdon, Pinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and Rutledge, appear to the conſtitution of the United States. I ſhould prove as tedious as Camillus, were I to enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate all the inſtances which occur of the moſt zealous fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deraliſts, who have every where appeared among the oppoſers
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:028389_0669_0FD8EDFCD074D848"/>of this infamous compact. Not only the political characters, but the meaſures purſued by thoſe who condemn the treaty, have fallen under the laſh of his pen. No excuſe can be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his miſrepreſentations on this ſubject—That the town meeting of Boſton denounced it the very day after its arrival, and, without a reading, is an aſſertion directly oppoſed to all the teſtimony we have of their proceedings. The account of our own town-meeting, and of the manner in which it was obtained is too groſs to impoſe on any of the citizens of New-York.

Jay, or a wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to overthrow the government, and introduce anarchy and civil diſcord—and that a war with Great-Britain will be the inevitable conſequence of a rejection. Theſe remarks have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been oppoſed by others, which, unleſs I miſtake, have not only detected their ſophiſtry, but expoſed their pernicious tendency. Admitting all theſe matters to be exactly as ſtated by Camillus, how do they juſtify an inference that the treaty is a good one? They may prove that Great-Britain cannot be expected to make an equal commercial connection with this country; but will it thence follow, that we are bound to make a diſadvantageous one with her? No opinion is better found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or prevails more univerſally, than that the fewer European connections we form the better. We poſſeſs the means of a growing and extenſive commerce. The articles we export, particularly proviſions and raw materials, being of the firſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity towards the ſupport and manufactures of other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, there is no danger of not finding a market for them. To Britain, in particular, our commerce is of the higheſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. In return for the manufactures which we take from her European dominions, we ſend her proviſions and raw ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, The balance, which is generally againſt us, we pay in ſpecie. It will, therefore, certainly be her intereſt and policy to continue and extend a trade ſo lucrative and important, without a treaty. If ſhe chooſes to keep all her Weſt-India ports ſhut againſt us, we can obtain from the iſlands of other powers the ſame articles which they produce; and, in times of ſcarcity, which very frequently occur, they muſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to America for proviſions and lumber. In every reſpect they are more dependent upon us, than we are upon them; and we ſhall ſoon force from them a much more advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous trade than we can expect to obtain by treaty.</p>
                     <p>Thus circumſtanced, America ſhould keep the ſtaff of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce in her own hands. She ought not, except in very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular caſes, to form treaties of commerce. If ſhe remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fettered, ſhe may avail herſelf of any advantage which may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the imprudence or ſituation of other countries. Let her make ſuch regulations as are beſt calculated to promote a ſpirit of enterprize—to add to her riches, and to increaſe the induſtry of her inhabitants, and let her have courage and conſtancy enough, never to depart from them in favour of ſtrangers. In her preſent defenceleſs and infant ſtate, it is next to madneſs to attempt forming a connection with this nation, without making ſacrifices, and conſenting to reſtraints far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:028389_0674_0FD8EE0E96E09CF8"/>thoſe which the laws of nations impoſe, which ought per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to form the only rule between two commercial powers. But if a treaty with Great-Britain, under any circumſtances, be proper, why inſert in it matters which have no relation to commerce, and which properly form materials for a ſeparate connection? I mean the reſpective complaints of the two go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments againſt each other. By inſerting proviſions for an adjuſtment of theſe complaints in a treaty of commerce, Great-Britain has not only exacted unreaſonable conceſſions for them on our part; but if a ratification does not eventually take place, the whole ground muſt be again travelled over, and probably at a time when Great-Britain will be in a ſituation to hold a tone ſtill more haughty and imperious than ſhe now does. Perhaps, indeed, this was one reaſon which induced the adviſers of the meaſure to keep from the ſenate the real ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of mr. Jay's miſſion; certain it is, that from the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent's meſſage, they had as much reaſon to believe that an alliance, offenſive and defenſive, was in agitation with Great-Britain, as a treaty of commerce; and yet by the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all treaties are to be made "by and with the <hi>advice</hi> and conſent of the ſena<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>." The plain meaning of this clauſe is, that no treaty ſhall be negociated without the <hi>advice,</hi> nor ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified without the conſent of the ſenate. This conſtruction has been ſanctioned on other occaſions, by the preſident himſelf. Even with Indian treaties, he has, previous to negociation, ſubmitted to them the contents and taken their advice on every part.</p>
                     <p>The term, <hi>advice</hi> refers naturally and obviouſly to negoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. Would it not be abſurd to ſay, that advice was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry after a thing was done? Conſent alone could then be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. There is, beſides, a manifeſt propriety in the preſident's conſulting the ſenate before hand. The perſon employed to negociate would then act with the greater confidence, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that his inſtructions proceeded not from the preſident alone, but were the reſult of the accumulated wiſdom of the ſenate: there would be leſs danger, alſo, of a refuſal to ratify on their part, which may ſometimes be productive of nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al jealouſies, wars and other calamities, it being unuſual not to ratify a treaty made with a miniſter properly appointed and inſtructed. Thus, whether we conſider the policy of making any treaty with Great-Britain, as an abſtract queſtion, or the ſecret and clandeſtine manner in which the preſent one origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, we ſhall find much room for doubt and cenſure. But it will be ſaid, we have already treaties of commerce with France
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:028389_0675_0FD8EE0F86617028"/>and other nations; true, and the one with France, though in every reſpect more favourable than the one under conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, has been the occaſion of much perplexity and embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to our government in the preſent war. Let ever ſo much care be uſed to make them explicit, and leave no room for conſtruction, ſtill doubts will ariſe, in the ſolution of which, not only the parties immediately concerned, but other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, become deeply intereſted. This has been the caſe with the French treaty. Mr. Genet, in behalf of his republic, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that the right of arming privateers in our ports, and other privileges, were ſecured to it by the treaty; all the other belligerent nations became parties to, or were intereſted in the controverſy; and had not our government oppoſed a claim, which was certainly ill-founded, a war with them might have been the conſequence. But if we had no treaty at all with France, we might, as a neutral nation, have opened our ports to the privateers and prizes of all the powers at war, without giving offence to any. Our other treaties, therefore, inſtead of militating in favour of ſuch conections, furniſh very ſtrong<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and, if I may uſe the expreſſion, very <hi>feeling</hi> arguments againſt them.</p>
                     <p>While on this ſubject, I cannot forbear to remark, that a nation weak at ſea, as America now is, and muſt ever conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, unleſs a different ſyſtem is ſpeedily adopted, can never promiſe herſelf any good from the ſtricteſt commercial ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the part of a nation which is emphatically become miſtreſs of the ocean. With ſuch a power we had better have no connections, except ſuch as ariſe out of the laws of nations. We ſhall not only be inclined, but compelled to obſerve our engagements, while Great-Britain will regard them only as long as ſhe finds it her intereſt, and will laugh, if not inſult us, when we complain of her infractions.</p>
                     <p>I come now to the ſixth number of Camillus, in which he accounts for no proviſion appearing in the treaty againſt the preſſing our ſeamen. The object is admitted to be of the laſt importance to the United States; but Camillus is at a loſs to know how it could have been done. "A general ſtipulation againſt it," ſays he, "would have been nugatory, if not <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regatory.</hi>" Could there be any thing derogatory in Great-Britain ſaying ſhe would abſtain from an infamous practice, which perhaps no nation but America ever ſubmitted to ſo long and ſo patiently. If her exiſtence and ſafety depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her maritime ſuperiority, is this ſuperiority to be maintained at our expenſe? Is one of our moſt uſeful claſſes of citizens
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:028389_0676_0FD8EEE6053C2238"/>to be forced into her ſervice, and add to her aggrandizement, to the ruin of our own commerce? and when we aſk her to ſtipulate againſt ſuch outrages in future, is inſult to be added to injury? Are we to be told, that until the Americans change their language and looks, it is impoſſible to diſcriminate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſeamen of the two nations? Methinks every ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man found on board of an American veſſel, and ſpeaking Engliſh, ſhould be, prima facie, deemed a citizen of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States, and ſhould be protected as ſuch, until he was prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a deſerter from, or a ſubject of Great-Britain. If the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of an American frigate ſhould take it into his head to preſs into our ſervice the crew of an Engliſh merchatman, merely becauſe they ſpoke Engliſh, and looked like Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, would Great-Britain ſubmit to the indignity? but if our flag is not to protect them, where is the difficulty of each man being furniſhed with a certificate of his birth or citizen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, authenticated according to a preſcribed form? No, ſays Camillus, who has always an anſwer ready, when Great-Britain is to be exculpated, this mode is liable to deception, and therefore cannot be relied on. Truly, ſir! your ingenui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> aſtoniſhes me. Becauſe, now and then, an impoſition may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Great-Britain find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it very convenient to man her navy with our ſeamen, and her national ſafety being at ſtake, inſiſts upon, and will exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, the right of taking them wherever ſhe find<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Our miniſter would have acted with becoming dignity, if he had broke off the negociation, until ſhe had conſented to an article of more importance to this country than all the others put together, and which would have made ſome amends for the innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable advantages which Great-Britain derives from the treaty. The rights and ſecurity of theſe much-injured and uſeful men have been moſt wantonly abandoned: nor do they alone feel the effects of this abominable ſpecies of dep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <pb n="101" facs="unknown:028389_0677_0FD8BEA7189A5700"/>the whole inſtrument, which, as they affect America, have been dictated by either of thoſe ſentiments.</p>
                     <p>Another part of the reaſoning of Camillus muſt not be overlooked. "Our right to an exemption," ſays he, "is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect by the laws of nations; and a contrary right is not even pretended by Great-Britain." It were to be wiſhed that Great-Britain would reſt contented with a bare <hi>pretenſion</hi> to this right. Unfortunately, ſhe exerciſes it every day; and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of our fellow-citizens, notwithſtanding the <hi>exemption</hi> to which they are entitled, are dragged from their own veſſels into a ſervice which they execrate. If the laws of nations ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us an exemption, where could be the harm of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratory article to that effect? Other parts of the treaty, when againſt America, have been juſtified by ſome, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably will be by Camillus, becauſe of their conformity to the laws of nations. Thus it has been ſaid, and no doubt will be repeated, that by thoſe laws, free veſſels do not make free goods, and that therefore, mr. Jay yielded nothing, when he conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to an article of that kind. Why then ſhould not Great-Britain humour us in our turn? If mr. Jay is juſtifiable for doing us a greater injury with one ſtroke of his pen, than he can repair if he lives to the age of Methuſalem, becauſe the law of nations was on his ſide, why not expect, any, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon the ſame complaiſance from Great-Britain? to what inconſiſtencies and ſhifts are ſenſible men driven, when they vindicate a bad cauſe! to what an abject ſtate, my country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, are you reduced! Great-Britain is become ſole arbiter of your rights, and the men whom you have loaded with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors and offices, and who for years have drawn all their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port from your coffers, and who ought in gratitude to defend you, not only conſent to ſurrender your perſons and liberties, but inſult your underſtandings by an attempt to make you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they have ſtudied your true intereſts in ſo doing— God forbid! that ſome dark and wicked project ſhould lurk behind all this myſterious conduct. Time alone can diſcover, why Americans are to be dragooned juſt at this time, at the evident hazard of a rupture with France, into this new and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful connection. Events, yet in the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap> of time, muſt develope whether Great-Britain has promiſed any, and what aid to a certain party, in the attempts it may make, to ſtrengthen the government, and give it, as it is modeſtly called, a little more energy. In the mean while, let us be vigilant, and we ſhall defeat every attempt upon our independence, and cover
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:028389_0678_0FD8EE13957DD8A8"/>with confuſion thoſe who dare to raiſe a ſacrilegious hand againſt our free and happy conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>We are now arrived with Camillus at the firſt article of the treaty. The way has been tedious and diſagreeable. He has told us, out of <hi>pure patriotiſm,</hi> many unpalatable <hi>truths.</hi> Thank God, notwithſtanding all his pains and eloquence (for even his enemies muſt allow him to write well) my former good opinion of my country is unſhaken. Her conduct with reſpect to Great-Britain will bear the ſtricteſt ſcrutiny. She has, indeed, been more finned againſt than finning. If I am miſtaken, the deluſion is pleaſant, and I hope Camillus will not think me obſtinate, when he is aſſured, that hitherto I have not diſcovered the ſtrength of any ground he has thought proper to take.</p>
                     <p>In diſcuſſing the firſt article, Camillus encounters an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, ſtated by the Charleſton committee. It muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, there does not appear to be much force in the objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and yet, as ſome Britiſh ſubjects were proſcribed during the war, it may be a doubt whether thoſe of that deſcription will not be permitted to return under the treaty. It was, at any rate, hardly worth while to find fault with this article, and perhaps ſomewhat puerile in Camillus to take ſo much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſeriouſly to combat, what the objectors themſelves could not have laid much ſtreſs on. The committee had, perhaps, diſcovered ſo many faults in the other articles, they thought it impoſſible <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="111" facs="unknown:028389_0687_0FD8EE26C812E8E8"/>Jacob Read, <hi>our unworthy ſenator</hi>—corrupt motives for his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcence in a treaty which would have made his country in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous!—would have reſtored her back to Britain! We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not heſitate to declare him, (with his nineteen quon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam coadjutors) undeſerving of any further public confidence: And, guided by an opinion founded in a knowledge of human nature, we do inſiſt, that if not loſt to all the ſine feelings of the heart, 'twill be impoſſible they can withſtand that immenſe torrent of opprobrium which will ruſh upon them; they muſt reſign! they cannot, in future, tranſact any public buſineſs!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſolved,</hi> That as the power of finally making and ratifying treaties by the preſident and two-thirds of the ſenate alone, has, in the preſent caſe, been proved to be of a moſt alarming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dangerous nature; that our very exiſtence as a free people, had been put at ſtake; that had not a good providence influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced even the <hi>twenty</hi> of the ſenate to reject <hi>one</hi> article, which, <hi>from neceſſity,</hi> muſt arreſt the hand of the preſident from ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, we ſay, that had not the providential care, which we have ſo often experienced, interpoſed, we had been a loſt, an undone people, without pity, and without friends!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore, Reſolved,</hi> That our members be earneſtly called on, at the next meeting of the aſſembly, to propoſe an amendment to the federal conſtitution, ſo far as reſpects the power of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing treaties. That a preſident, and twenty ſenators, perhaps fourteen (for that number makes a quorum) ſhall have the ſole power of making treaties, which muſt be, neceſſarily, the ſupreme law; muſt be binding on every individual, which ſwallow up the ſovereignty and independence of each ſtate! No! the people now ſee the folly of giving ſuch a power into the hands of fourteen men, which, at all times, may ſupercede every exiſting law in the union! 'tis too much! Without a diſpoſition to judge uncharitably of men, we ſay 'tis poſſible that twenty or fourteen men may be tempted, may be bribed to betray the precious truſt repoſed, in them by their fellow-citizens! And we repeat, that as it is notorious Britain carries all her points by corruption, (look in lord North's eſtimate during the American war; you will there find one million for contingents or ſecret ſervice! Has not France, throughout her ſtruggle, complained ſhe felt Britiſh corruption in her very vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals! and ſhall America expect to eſcape her baneful influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence!) then 'tis <hi>poſſible</hi> that twenty or fourteen men may be led to ſell even their country! We, therefore, again urge it on our repreſentatives, to bring forward an amendment, by which <hi>congreſs at large, and congreſs alone,</hi> ſhall have the power of
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:028389_0688_0FD8EE2B2BA23250"/>forming treaties, at leaſt of <hi>ratifying</hi> them. We venture to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the people will not be ſatisfied ſhort of this: from one extreme of the continent to the other, this will be the univerſal language. We know, in framing the federal conſtitution, the objection to giving the houſe of repreſentatives this power, jointly with the ſenate and preſident, was, <hi>that negociations ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally required the greateſt ſecrecy, and that was not to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from ſo large a body.</hi> Curſe on ſuch ſecrecy! it has undone our country! An American aſſembly, aloof from the combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Europe, ſhould have no ſecrets! No government in the known world, like our's, ever gave ſuch an extenſive lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude as we allow to the preſident and ſenate; even the moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary kings never poſſeſſed any thing like it! In France, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the old government, appearances at leaſt, were kept up; the king's edicts were never of force until regiſtered in parliament. In England they proceed with diffidence in making treaties— far from being conſidered as legal without a parliamentary ſanction, the preamble always ſtates that <hi>"his majeſty would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to obtain a law for ratifying the treaty."</hi> Such is the language and conduct of monarchs, and what is our's? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

In this happy, but envied ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, had a gracious providence placed us; and, guided by theſe principles, we ſhould have had no wars.

                        <note n="*" place="bottom">FROM THE MINERVA.
<p>The following is an authentic extract of a letter from a gentleman of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and information in Vermont; for the truth of which we pledge our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. It comes from a man of ſeventy-ſix, and is dated July 18. 1795.</p>
                           <p>"The treaty of peace has now become a general ſubject of converſation, but is not as yet enough known to form the public mind. It is impoſſible for the madmen in politics to communicate their madneſs to the ſubſtantial and numerous body of country farmers. They do not reverence the cuſtoms, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or violent party, inflammatory writings of your zealous political <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natics. And while thoſe kind of writers pleaſe themſelves with the conceit that they are enlightening the age and the world, they have no idea in what contempt their productions are viewed in the country. In ſentiment and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, they are below the underſtanding of every country farmer; and the declamatory, violent ſtile ſinks them ſtill lower, in rural eſtimation. We are apprehenſive that ſome of the large cities will endeavour to ſet their mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                              </gap> in motion, with a view to dictate to the preſident and ſenate. Be aſſured we will reject the federal union, before we will be governed in the country, by the mobs of Philadelphia, New-York, or Boſton. Moderation, in ſuch a caſe, would be an error;—and the moment your mobs are ſet agoing, you eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh a diſtinction between town and country, which you will not eaſily get rid of. The greateſt and worſt of all political events that the country would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, would be to have the government of it, under the direction of ſuch tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, outrageous, lawleſs aſſemblies.</p>
                           <p>"The above is to carry to you ſome idea of the horror we entertain of a mob-government. Be ſo good as to remember the articles of buſineſs."</p>
                        </note>.</head>
                     <p>I Will not venture to aſcertain what was the real view of the letter writer; he is, at all events, very wroth with the citizens of great cities, principally, as it appears to me becauſe he ſuſpects they will dare to intermeddle in poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, without obtaining his permiſſions or at leaſt without being on his ſide. It is impoſſible, however, to avoid obſerving
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:028389_0691_0FD8EE32CA2A4F68"/>that without his knowing what had really happened in theſe cities, the obvious errors in the treaty are ſo conſpicuous, and, in contradiction to his will, obtrude themſelves ſo forcibly on his brain, as to compel on his mind a ſuſpicion, that mobs will be raiſed, while his with appears clearly to be, that no oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be made againſt its obtaining the preſident's ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ſhould even its commercial errors be ruinous to the trade, and its political errors deſtructive to the liberties and peace of this country.</p>
                     <p>I know the people of Vermont well—they are quite good citizens; but they are likewiſe firm and inflexible patriots.</p>
                     <p>They know the value of their rights, and they will, if neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, maintain them at every riſque.</p>
                     <p>I will firſt, therefore, make a few obſervations on ſuch parts of this extraordinary inſtrument, as appears to me moſt evidently wrong, and moſt pointedly demonſtrative, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the head or the heart of the man who framed it, was ill calculated for executing the high truſt repoſed in him.</p>
                     <p>And ſecondly, aſſign ſome reaſons why the people of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, as well as of other parts of this extended country, will purſue every conſtitutional method in then power, to prevent its becoming the ſupreme law of the land.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond article is, in my opinion, an indelible ſtain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the honour and dignity of the nation; for, by agreeing that the poſts ſhall not be delivered up till the firſt of June 1796, without any ſtronger obligation on the part of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh for the ſurrender of them at that period, than we had at the treaty of peace, it is tacitly agreed, that the unjuſt reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them was no infraction of that treaty.</p>
                     <p>Where was that genius of America, which governed its councils at the termination of the war? who, in a firm and manly tone, told this haughty and imperious government of Great-Britain, that, "we will not ſpeak on the ſubject of peace till you have firſt acknowledged our independence."</p>
                     <p>Or are our preſent claims to theſe poſts, after being abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ceded to us by a former treaty, made with that very govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, leſs valid or leſs concluſive, than a claim to that inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence which we then, in ſuch unqualified terms, declared, ſhould actually form the baſis of the treaty? No, but our <hi>then</hi> miniſters were different men, and had very different views from what <hi>ſome</hi> of them have at preſent.</p>
                     <p>If the third article is conſtrued <hi>literally,</hi> it certainly does not provide for a <hi>free</hi> trade between Vermont and Canada, by the way of Lake Champlain. The words are, "but it is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:028389_0692_0FD8EE39293DADA0"/>that this article does not extend to the admiſſion of veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the United States, into the ſea-ports, harbours, bays or creeks of his majeſty's ſaid territories; nor into ſuch parts of the rivers in his majeſty's ſaid territories, as are between the mouth thereof <hi>and the higheſt port of entry from the ſea,</hi> except in ſmall veſſels, trading <hi>bona fide</hi> between Montreal and Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bec."</p>
                     <p>St. John's, at the bottom of Lake Champlain, is, ſtrictly ſpeaking, a Britiſh port of entry, where the American veſſels, as well as all craft from Canada, for any part of that Lake, have entered and cleared out, ever ſince the peace; the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont trade, therefore, by this uſeful lake, muſt, on a rigorous conſtruction of that article, ſtop at that port.</p>
                     <p>How far the people of that ſtate may eſteem themſelves obliged to mr. Jay, for leaving ſo beneficial a branch of their trade, ſubject to ſuch an indefinite, uncertain conſtruction, I will not ſay.</p>
                     <p>The actual evil which may ariſe from the ninth article, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends in a great degree, upon the quantity of land now held by Britiſh ſubjects. If, as is ſaid by many, they at this moment hold ſeveral millions of acres, the preſent proprietors may, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on their leaſe or ſale thereof, to actual ſettlers, make it a condition, <hi>that they ſhall remain Britiſh ſubjects;</hi> in this caſe, a ſhort time would probably diſcover the benefits which would accrue <hi>from having one or two millions of Britiſh ſubjects actual ſettlers on our frontiers,</hi> who, the treaty declares, "ſhall not, as far as may reſpect the ſaid lands, and the legal remedies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident thereto, be regarded as aliens;" a due attention to the twenty-ſixth article of the treaty, will poſſibly enable many good republicans to diſcover mr. Jay's real intentions; for even <hi>in caſe of war,</hi> though they ſhall remain Britiſh ſubjects, they cannot be compelled to quit the country as long "as they behave peaceably, and commit no offence againſt the laws." Many of us remember the diſtreſſes ſuffered by the patriots of this country laſt war, by only a few of ſuch men being amongſt us. It was beſt, perhaps, not to have theſe two arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the treaty too near each other.</p>
                     <p>But I would aſk "the gentleman of character and infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in Vermont," by what part of the conſtitution of the United States, congreſs at large, <hi>much leſs the ſenate and preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> have the power of declaring that <hi>aliens</hi> ſhall, <hi>in any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> have a right to hold lands within any one ſtate?</p>
                     <p>I am ſafe in averring, that each ſtate has hitherto claime<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the <hi>excluſive</hi> priviledge of granting or prohibiting that right.</p>
                     <p>And the third ſection of the fourth article of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:028389_0693_0FD8EE3A44E1A240"/>after granting to congreſs, "power to diſpoſe of and make all needful rules and regulations reſpecting the territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or other property <hi>belonging to the United States,</hi>" explicitly declares, that "nothing in this conſtitution ſhall be ſo conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to prejudice any claims of the United States, <hi>or of any particular ſtate.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>Does the letter writer imagine, that the people of Vermont, becauſe they are known to be truly federal, will tamely ſubmit to ſee their ſtate deprived of a privilege ſo important and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive, and ſo pointedly guarded to them by the conſtitution of the United States, without ever remonſtrating againſt it?</p>
                     <p>I wiſh to heavens that the letter writer was the only man in America, who would ſacrifice the rights of <hi>his ſtate,</hi> to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancy of <hi>his party.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The tenth article, which declares, that "neither the debts due from individuals of the one nation to the individuals of another, nor ſhares, nor monies which they may have in the public funds, or in the public or private banks, ſhall ever, in any event of war, or national differences, be ſequeſtered or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated," carries, I readily acknowledge, the <hi>appearance</hi> of honor and honeſty, on the very face of it; but unfortunately in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſtribution of the conſequences of that ſtipulation, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into between the contracting parties, all the benefits ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefrom go to the ſide of the Britiſh only, and all the diſadvantages to the ſide of this country; we having ſcarce any money in their funds, or any debts due by them to us; while they have immenſe ſums under our controul, which ought to have been maintained in that ſituation, for the expreſs purpoſe of being a preventative againſt ſuch a predatory, diſgraceful warfare, as they have waged againſt us, <hi>with impunity,</hi> for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of two years.</p>
                     <p>Fat am I from thinking, that either a ſequeſtration or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcation ought to take place on any ſlight or frivolous occaſion. May the honor and integrity of the United States become proverbial throughout the habitable world.</p>
                     <p>To explain myſelf by a homely, but I think, ſtriking ſimile, I will ſuppoſe that our friend, mr.—, who is a man twice as ſtrong as I am, had frequently met me in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and had ſometimes ſeverely drubbed me, at other times, had thrown me in the mud, and ruined my clothes; that I had made frequent remonſtrances againſt this ill treatment, but in vain, having, to all my mild remonſtrances, and humiliating petitions, received from him, nothing but vindictive, and ſuperci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious replies; that at laſt I loaded a piſtol of his, which happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:028389_0694_0FD8EE3C8CE6FE68"/>to be in my houſe, put it into my pocket, and threatened to blow his brains out the next time he ever attacked me on the highway; that I then ſent a friend, on whoſe good ſenſe and integrity I ſtrongly relied, for the purpoſe of adopting ſome mode for terminating all our diſputes.</p>
                     <p>That this friend, after having ſettled on terms in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects very favourable to mr.—, ſtipulated, in the moſt poſitive manner, that, though it was profitable and convenient for him ſtill to leave his piſtol with me, I ſhould never attempt to uſe it in my own defence againſt him, even to ſave my own life, notwithſtanding a future attack, on his part, ſhould be equally violent, virulent, and unprovoked, as thoſe which he had formerly made on me, my friend obtaining at the ſame time, a promiſe from mr.—, equally obligatory on him, that he would never uſe againſt me, a little popgun, which my friend very well knew could not poſſibly injure me more than by taking a button off my coat.</p>

                     <p>The 17th article declares, that the goods of an enemy to Great-Britain, found on board any of our veſſels, ſhall be made prize of.</p>
                     <p>This, it is admitted, is agreeable to the common law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as that law formerly ſtood; for Vatel ſays, page 507, that "effects, belonging to an enemy, found on board a neu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>Mr. Jay carefully adhered to the firſt part of this maxim. It is certainly very favourable to the Britiſh. The ſecond part, which reſpects the payment of the freight, is neglected: it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly would have been very favourable to the people of the United States.</p>
                     <p>But, when our worthy preſident iſſued his proclamation of neutrality, he predicated it upon the modern law of nations: an adherence to which would have prevented our miniſter
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:028389_0695_0FD8EE401C652270"/>from entering into a poſitive ſtipulation for ſuch an ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious conceſſion.</p>
                     <p>The twenty-third article of our treaty with France, the tenth with Holland, the ſeventh with Sweden, the twelfth with Pruſſia, and the third with the emperor of Morocco, all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively ſtipulate, in the moſt expreſs terms, that free ſhips ſhall make free goods, though theſe goods ſhould belong to the enemy of either of thoſe nations. Though I am not a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, common ſenſe points out to me, on the firſt bluſh, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive advantages which muſt have accrued to our carrying-trade, by an adherence to the ſame plan in our preſent treaty with Great-Britain. Did the recollection of the innumerable favours which Great-Britain has heaped on us from the nineteenth April, 1775, to the very moment at which he ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the treaty, overwhelm our ambaſſador with neck-loads of gratitude, that he forgot that this article was diametrically op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to our ſtipulation with every other nation with whom we had a treaty?</p>
                     <p>I do not mean, that our other treaties precluded him from the right of entering into this ſtipulation. I only wiſh to ſhow, that, while France and other friendly nations had voluntarily granted to us this ineſtimable privilege in our very indigent days, our ambaſſador, though to the higheſt prejudice of that nation, meanly and cringingly ceded it to Great-Britain, in the height of our proſperity! Or did he imagine it would pleaſe his countrymen, to proclaim to the world, that, like true ſpaniels, they fawned moſt on thoſe from whom they had the ſevereſt whippings?</p>
                     <p>I feel for the honor of my country, and pray to my God, that, though ſhe is fallen, it may not be for ever.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps this part of the treaty, as well as ſeveral other parts, were entered into for the expreſs purpoſe of diſtreſſing the French nation, and thereby occaſioning a rupture between them and us. If this was really mr. Jay's policy, I think it is far from being improbable, that we may ſoon reap the fruits of his labour, by fully experiencing the good or bad effects thereof.</p>
                     <p>The eighteenth article, regulating what is in future to be deemed contraband, is ſo ſuperlatively humiliating and degrad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ourſelves; ſo plainly and unequivocally levelled againſt the ſucceſs of our ally, that even Camillus finds himſelf com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to make a wayward apology for it.</p>
                     <p>Poor Camillus, thou waſt then driven to thy laſt ſhift in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and heaven knows that thou art poſſeſt of more of them
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:028389_0696_0FD8EE41C365ACB8"/>in the defence of a bad cauſe, than any man of thy country was ever before.</p>
                     <p>In this, as in the former article, our <hi>extraordinary ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> has ſtipulated, that naval ſtores, &amp;c. ſhall be deemed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traband, and liable to capture; though it will appear by the twenty-fourth article of our treaty with France, the twenty-fourth with Holland, the tenth with Sweden, the thirteenth with Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, and the third with the emperor of Morocco, that we have contracted, that they ſhall not be contraband. Nay, what as far as is poſſible, adds to the diſgrace of this part of the treaty, even Great-Britain herſelf, in her commercial treaty, with France, declares that they ſhall not be contraband.</p>
                     <p>What opinion our ally will entertain of our friendſhip for her—what opinion the world at large will entertain of our mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity, good faith, and gratitude as a nation, and in what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of eſtimation our miniſter will be held by his fellow citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens at ſome future period, time only can fully unravel.</p>
                     <p>If even the extacy of joy, upon being permitted the honor of kiſſing the queen's hand, was ſo exceſſive, as to obliterate from his mind, that cotton was a branch of the produce of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, it is ſcarcely poſſible to ſuppoſe, that the pleaſure conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſo extremely raviſhing during the whole negociation, as to make him forget that there were two ſuch ſtates as <hi>Virgi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>The twenty-firſt article defines what piracy is, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines what the puniſhment thereof ſhall be, by ſaying, "that if any ſubject or citizen of the ſaid parties reſpectively, ſhall accept any foreign commiſſion or letters of marque, for arming any veſſel to act as a privateer againſt the other party, and be taken by the other party, it is hereby declared to be lawful <hi>for the ſaid party,</hi> to treat and puniſh the ſaid ſubject or citizen, having ſuch commiſſion, or letters of marque, <hi>as a pirate.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>The eighth ſection of the conſtitution of the United States, declares, that "congreſs ſhall have the power to <hi>define and puniſh piracies</hi> and felonies committed on the high ſeas, and offences againſt the law of nations."</p>
                     <p>The curſe of oblivion ſeems to have pervaded our miniſter's brain in every part of this treaty, which did not embrace ſome point favourable to the Britiſh; for here again, he has forgot that the <hi>houſe of repreſentatives</hi> are an abſolute (though in his opinion, probably a very trifling) part of congreſs; and as <hi>they</hi> were not to be conſulted about the propriety or impropriety of
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:028389_0697_0FD8EE4408A09A58"/>this treaty, he ought to have ſeen that he was entering into an agreement which the ſenate could not approve of, nor the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident ratify, without a palpable breach of the conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>But for argument's ſake, I will for a moment ſuppoſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional, and I will likewiſe acknowledge, that by the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-firſt article of our treaty with France, the nineteenth with Holland, and the twenty-third with Sweden, the ſame crime was by our then congreſs <hi>(not by a part of it)</hi> deemed a piracy; but muſt, at the ſame time, inſiſt, that the manner of puniſhment is deſcribed in a very different way. In each of theſe treaties the words are theſe, "and if any perſon of either nation ſhall take ſuch commiſſions or letters of marque, <hi>he ſhall be puniſhed at a pirate."</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In our treaties with Pruſſia and the emperor of Morocco, it is ſtipulated, that "ſubjects, nor citizens of either party, ſhall take commiſſions from any power with whom either of the contracting parties may be at war;" but no puniſhment whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is affixed to the breach of that article.</p>
                     <p>By our treaty, then, on this head, with the firſt three nations above mentioned, the offender againſt the article was. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, upon complaint made, or information lodged, to be tried, as the conſtitution directs, by a jury of his countrymen conſpicuous for their moderation, lenity and juſtice; and, if ſtrong extenuating circumſtances appeared in his favour, ſhould even the jury eſteem themſelves obliged to condemn him, agreeable to the letter of the law, they might, nevertheleſs, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly recommend him to that branch of the government, in whoſe hands the pleaſing power of ſhowing mercy is ſo wiſely placed.</p>
                     <p>As no puniſhment is annexed to the crime by our treaty with the other two powers, the offender muſt have been trie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> upon common principles.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Jay has the honour of being the firſt American miniſter, who ever had the courage by public act, to declare, in expreſs terms, that his fellow-citizens are liable to be condemned as pirates, by a Britiſh court of admiralty, for an act of which the law of nations renders even the criminality doubtful.</p>
                     <p>What does he really ſay on this head of the treaty? Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing his moſt inventive talents to enrage his fellow-citizens to ſome improper unconſtitutional act, he virtually tells them, I ſee that you ſtill remain equally attached to, equally ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured with the principles of liberty, as you did when I was a <hi>pacific</hi> bellower in that cauſe, and therefore, that your attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the French nation, in her preſent conteſt, may lead ſome

                     <p>But, continues Mr. Jay, I will riſk deviating materially from the words of every treaty hitherto entered into by the United States, ſhould my act even be an unconſtitutional one, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that, if fighting in this cauſe you are taken by the Engliſh, it ſhall be in their power to hang you as pirates.</p>

                     <p>I will at the ſame time confeſs, that if mr. Jay is equally careful of the perſon of the <hi>preſent governor</hi> of this ſtate, [New-York] as he was of his own at the time Eſopus was burnt, by the marauding army of his favourite nation, there is no riſk that his excellency will ſuffer from this neglect, as he will not become a priſoner till the Britiſh reach the mountains of Kent. A deſire to obey his excellency's orders will produce an explanation of this, whenever he is pleaſed to require it.</p>
                     <p>I am aware, that it will be obſerved, that as there were two parties to the treaty, it was impoſſible for mr. Jay to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all he wiſhed—Granted—But, does it follow from thence, that in the humiliating manner he has done, we were to yield up to the ambitious and ſupercilious arrogance of the other party, whatever ſhe, <hi>in the agonizing frenzy of departing great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> might think proper to require.</p>
                     <p>What opinion muſt the other nations entertain of either our honor or independence, whoſe treaties with us are demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated to be ſo much more in our favor, than the one mr. Jay has thought proper to ſubmit to?</p>
                     <p>We boaſt of our increaſe in wealth, in numbers, in reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability as a nation, all ariſing from the good management of the political machine, by thoſe who have the preſent direction thereof: and yet this treaty muſt give the lie direct to that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion in the opinion of every man, not intimately acquainted with our true ſituation; becauſe it abjectly crouches beneath the galling yoke of Great-Britain, and ſervilely grants to her what no other nation, in the hour of our greateſt diſtreſs, <hi>before we had even thrown off our ſwaddling bands,</hi> ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to demand of us.</p>
                     <p>I will quit this firſt part of my promiſe, and proceed to my ſecond, by ſhowing ſome reaſons, why the people in <hi>Vermont,</hi> as well as in other parts of this extended country, will purſue

                     <p>But it will be objected, that twenty ſenators having gives
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:028389_0703_0FD8EE535E97F860"/>their ſanction to its adoption, <hi>is prima facie</hi> evidence that it muſt be a moſt excellent treaty—Granted.</p>
                     <p>And it will be anſwered, that ten ſenators being warmly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to it, and every <hi>tory</hi> in the country extolling it as the greateſt proof that heaven ever furniſhed, of its watchful at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention over the honor, liberty, peace, proſperity, welfare, and independence of the United States, is likewiſe <hi>prima facie</hi> evidence that it is a moſt d—n—able treaty. And the ſenſible yeomanry of this country, after ſubtracting the one evidence from the other, and finding the balance greatly againſt the treaty, will therefore more firmly oppoſe it.</p>
                     <p>Many other arguments might be produced; but I ſhall ſtop here, and aſſign ſome additional reaſons, why I am of opinion, that the yeomanry of <hi>Vermont</hi> will, in a particular manner, oppoſe it.</p>
                     <p>Their connection with Canada has given them frequent opportunities of viewing the ſupercilious, haughty deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of many of the Britiſh officers, to whom the etiquette of that government led them to make application; and they have obſerved their deep-rooted contempt of republicaniſm and republican manners. They will, therefore, oppoſe an <hi>intimacy</hi> of national connection.</p>
                     <p>That ſtate has been ſuperior to moſt, and inferior to none, in point of <hi>federaliſm;</hi> and they will, therefore, be delicately careful in preventing their darling conſtitution from being, in the ſmalleſt degree, impaired or infringed on.</p>
                     <p>The citizens of that ſtate, even their profeſſional men of all deſcriptions, are (ſpeaking generally) warm admirers of the French cauſe, though they do not attempt to juſtify all their actions: and as many of the leading features of this treaty have a ſtrong tendency to diſtreſs that cauſe, they will oppoſe it with an energy, proportionate to their love of ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al liberty, and of the rights of man.</p>
                     <p>But taking for granted, what the editor of the Minerva aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, that the unknown letter-writer in Vermont, is, "A gentleman of character and information," I will oppoſe his ſentiments by thoſe of another citizen of that ſtate, known by his writings and his pleadings to be <hi>really</hi> "a gentleman of character and information."—I mean judge Chipman, who, in the year 1793, previous to this buſtle about French and Engliſh politics, wrote "ſketches on the principles of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment," in which he exhibits maxims, perfectly conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with thoſe maintained by the preſent oppoſers to the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and equally repugnant to thoſe diſplayed by the learned

                     <p>The letter-writer ſays, in great heat, "we are apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive that ſome of the large cities will endeavour to ſet their <hi>mobs</hi> in motion, with a view to dictate to the preſident and ſenate.

                     <p>Theſe two are the expreſs ſentiments of thoſe who oppoſe the treaty;—but, poſſibly, <hi>my little wild politician,</hi> you will inſiſt that the judge meant to confine "public diſcuſſion" to the country only; and yet I ſuſpect, that it would bring a bluſh even into thy face, to be called on for a good argument to ſhow cauſe why the citizens of great mercantile cities ſhould be prevented from "diſcuſſing publicly," an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, chriſtened under the title of treaty of commerce and navigation.</p>
                     <p>Our letter writer is for truſting every thing to the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted authorities.</p>
                     <p>The worthy judge on the other hand, in page 159, makes an obſervation which we can have no reaſon to doubt is ſtrongly impreſſed on the preſident's mind, in the preſent bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs—"In the making of laws, a great regard muſt be had to the circumſtances, manners, and <hi>ſentiments</hi> of the people, as well as to the principles of the conſtitution—the laws muſt be the beſt which the people can bear."</p>
                     <p>To ſuppoſe, therefore, after admitting this principle, that the preſident would ratify the preſent treaty, in contradiction to the ſentiments of ſo reſpectable and ſo decided a majority of the people, is ſuppoſing that he would gratify his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, at the hazard of commotions, which would not only be extremely dangerous to the community, but would probably be attended with his own political deſtruction. And, how could the preſident have known, that the people were ſo univerſally oppoſed to this treaty, provided, as our letter writer ſeems to wiſh, they had been perfectly ſilent on the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>Was this treaty to be ratified, I am well convinced that the citizens of Vermont would almoſt univerſally oppoſe it, from a hearty concurrence with their worthy judge, in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſentiment, for they cannot be ignorant, that this treaty is in direct oppoſition to the expreſſed will of the houſe of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, who wiſhed to obtain juſtice from Great-Britain, not by the fawning ſlattery and cringing ſubmiſſion of a grovel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, proſtituted mind, but by that calm, deliberate, but ſtern firmneſs, in ſupport of our natural rights, neceſſary for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that reſpect and attention which our ſituation, our growing greatneſs, and the extenſive advantages of our trade and commerce gave us a right to claim from the nations of the world. Was, then, the preſident to give his ſanction to this treaty, we ſhould have the ſenate in favour of, and the houſe
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:028389_0706_0FD8EE59CAF9CC98"/>of repreſentatives, <hi>our beſt guardians,</hi> oppoſed to, the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which (if it is not unconſtitutional) would become <hi>the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme law of the land.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The citizens of Vermont, in that caſe, would draw many of their arguments from the pure republican fountain which the judge has laid open to them, in page 140, where he ſays, "Public diſcuſſion, and mature deliberation, in the making of laws, are indiſpenſibly neceſſary.—The ſenate and houſe of repreſentatives ſhould have equal powers. <hi>No law ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> without the concurrence of both."</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Are we to ſuppoſe, then, that the preſident will join the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in ſanctioning a law, ſuppoſing it even conſtitutional, which he knows to be repugnant to the wiſhes of the houſe of repreſentatives, and nine-tenths of the people? Curſed be he who entertains ſuch an opinion of him. Such an act would not be an error, it would be a crime.</p>
                     <p>I may, however, be poſſibly aſked—Should the preſident think himſelf juſtifiable in ratifying the treaty, ought not the people to reſt contented, and view it as the ſupreme law of the land? I heſitate not to anſwer, <hi>They ought not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It will then be their duty to convoke town-meetings, and petition their <hi>immediate</hi> repreſentatives in congreſs to declare, whether the privileges of that houſe have not been groſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed on? Whether, in certain parts of that treaty, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate have not exceeded their conſtitutional powers?</p>
                     <p>For I perfectly agree with the learned judge, whom I have ſo often quoted, in his opinion, page 117, "That the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is, thoſe organized bodies who are entruſted with the powers of government, <hi>are bound by the conſtitution, but have no power in themſelves, to make, alter or controul any of its laws.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>And it appears to me very clear, that the power granted to the preſident, by and with the advice and conſent of two-thirds of the ſenate preſent, <hi>to make treaties,</hi> could never, by the framers of the conſtitution, have been intended to controul thoſe important and extenſive rights, entruſted to congreſs at large, in two precedent clauſes of that ſame conſtitution, viz. "The powers of regulating commerce with foreign <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions," and "of defining and puniſhing piracies," which powers are granted in the moſt expreſs terms, and not, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to yield to mere implication, eſpecially when the admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that implication would be contradictory to the gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap> of the whole conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>Is it poſſible to ſuppoſe, that it was intended to authorize eleven members of the ſenate, with the preſident, legally to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:028389_0707_0FD8EE5B4A7B8090"/>the commerce of ſuch an extenſive mereantile country as this, and that their regulation was to be binding on the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, without a poſſibility of conſtitutional redreſs, however diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable it might be to them, to the majority of the ſenate, and to the whole houſe of repreſentatives? And yet this might happen, if the power of making treaties embraces all the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects our preſent treaty makers wiſh. For the power is granted to the preſident, and two-thirds of the ſenators <hi>preſent.</hi> As the ſenate conſiſts of only thirty members, and as it is provided by the conſtitution, that a majority of them ſhall form a quorum, it is in the power of ſixteen members to conclude a treaty; and as eleven members make more than two-thirds of thoſe ſixteen, they, with the preſident, would fully be empowered, by the conſtitution, to have formed the preſent pending treaty, momentous as it is, in contradiction to the wiſhes, <hi>informally</hi> declared, though in the moſt decided terms, of nineteen ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, the whole houſe of repreſentatives, and the whole of the people.</p>
                     <p>I again aſk, is it poſſible our conſtitution could have intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to clothe any twelve men with ſuch immenſe, ſuch uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable, ſuch irrevocable powers?</p>
                     <p>But I hear ſome people ſay—Should the preſident ratify this treaty, and ſhould the houſe of repreſentatives, regardleſs of the petition of the people, permit it to reſt on its preſent foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, unnoticed by them, what are the people to do in that caſe?</p>
                     <p>It muſt be acknowledged, that, in ſuch a caſe, we ſhould be placed, not only in a difficult, but a very diſmal ſituation: It would be the criſis for determining, whether the term, <hi>majeſty of the people,</hi> was, like the children's rattle, uſed merely to keep them from murmuring and complaining; or whether, in this land of liberty, it had an abſolute and real exiſtence, calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for much more important purpoſes.</p>
                     <p>But it is improper even to ſuppoſe, what there is ſo little probability of ever experiencing; for I again repeat, that the preſident never will give his ſanction to an irrevocable act, which he has the moſt convincing proofs of the great body of his fellow citizens viewing with hatred, horror, and contempt.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall conclude with calling heaven to witneſs, that no man more fervently wiſhes than I do, to ſee the citizens of the United States unanimous in their obedience to the laws of the land, as long as thoſe laws are founded on the immutable prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of juſtice, good ſaith, and national honor.</p>

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Betſey, W. Furlong, maſter, was heard and determined in London, by the lords com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of appeals, on the twenty-fifth July, <hi>1795.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>FROM the ſhip's papers and depoſitions of the captain and crew, produced in evidence on this cauſe, it appears that the brigantine Betſey, belonging wholly to mr. George Patter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, of Baltimore, cleared out from that port on the nineteenth December, 1793, for the iſland of St. Bartholomew's and a market. That inqueſt of a market ſhe went directly to Guadaloupe, where ſhe arrived on the eighth of January following. Here ſhe diſcharged her cargo of proviſions, and took in one of Weſt-India produce. With this cargo ſhe was proceeding to Balti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, when ſhe was met, and captured by the privateer ſloop of war, Agenoria, Willis Morgan, commander and taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Bermuda.</p>
                  <p>Her cargo conſiſted of ſugar, coffee, and other goods, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing, in certain ſpecified proportions, to the captain William Furlong, and to meſſrs. George and William Patterſon.</p>
                  <p>On the fourth of April, 1794, proceedings on behalf of the captors were commenced. On the twenty-third of April fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, the veſſel was claimed by captain Furlong, on behalf of mr. George Patterſon, and the cargo on behalf of himſelf, a citizen of the United States, and of meſſrs. George and William Patterſon, both alſo lawful citizens of the United States, and who had been for many years before reſident in Baltimore, in the ſtate of Maryland, where their families and houſes of trade were. Mr. George Patterſon has been alleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a native of Ireland—there is ſome doubt as to this fact—it is not contended, however, but that he was actually a citizen of the United States. It appears that he went over to Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daloupe for a ſpecial purpoſe, as the agent of his brother, and not with the view of reſiding there—on the contrary, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> propoſed returning without delay to Baltimore, as his place of reſidence.</p>
                  <p>On the twenty-firſt of May, 1794, the cauſe was brought on for a hearing, before John Green, <abbr>eſq</abbr> judge of the vice ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty court of Bermuda; and on the twenty-third of ſaid month, the veſſel with her "boat, tackle, apparel and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and all and ſingular her cargo and lading, were adjudged and condemned as lawful prize to the captors by the ſaid judge:

                  <p>The true ground of judge Green's decree appears to have been, according to his own words, becauſe "ſhe had come im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from a French port, declared by authority to have been blockaded by his Britannic majeſty's fleets and armies." It ſeems the "authority" that "declared" the French iſlands in a ſtate of blockade, was admiral ſir J. Jervis; and the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this act before the court was a copy of a letter from this officer, to Thomas Griffith, <abbr>eſq</abbr> of Barbadoes, of which the following is an exact tranſcript:</p>

                  <p>The independence of the American ſtates has done away that doctrine, as to all perſons ſettled there at the time of ſuch independence; and the great number of perſons who have emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grated to America ſince the independence, will require a moſt ſerious conſideration before the doctrine will be applied to them.</p>

                  <p>The maſter of the rolls obſerved, that the queſtion would probably require ſome underſtanding between the two countries.</p>
                  <p>Sir William Scott proceeded; he remarked, that as to are George Patterſon's birth and reſidence, the third witneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts the other two, and ſays, he believes mr. Patterſon was born in America; ſo that the fact is not proved; and as to his reſidence, he appears to have gone to Guadaloupe on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion only, and to have had no reſidence there; and as to the clearing out for St. Bartholomew, upon which much ſtreſs is laid, the fact is, the ſhip was cleared out for that iſland, (which is Daniſh) and for a market.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Erſkine in reply, declared he was more convinced than our that he was founded in aſking for confirmation of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of condemnation, as it is evident that the urgent, want of proviſions was the ſole inducement to let the ſhip take back the cargo of ſugar and coffee, without which ſhe could only have taken melaſſes.</p>
                  <p>He contended that the voyage may ſtrictly be conſidered as maſked, the iſland of St. Bartholomew being a kind of empo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium, and the words "for a market," a mere cover; and as to the ſeizure of the cargo by the French, it is evident that the owner was ſo well reconciled as to talk of ſending a further cargo. He did not aſk for condemnation on the letter of ſir John Jervis; he admitted the aſſertion of ſir William Scott, as
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:028389_0712_0FD8EE674FE92690"/>to its want of logical accuracy. Self-preſervation, however, was eſſential, and as much a principle with nations as with indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, and the political exiſtence of this country juſtified his expectation of condemnation.</p>
                  <p>Martinique was then reduced; and mr. Patterſon muſt have known it, and been well aſſured that Guadaloupe was an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate object of the Britiſh arms.</p>
                  <p>America, he contended, was entitled to no more and no leſs than other nations; and he had no doubt but that if mr. Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſon ſhould, on further enquiry (if it ſhould be thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to make it) appear to be a Britiſh ſubject by birth, his property would be liable to condemnation.</p>

                  <p>From the above ſtatement and deciſion, it appears that the proſpect of an indemnification by appeal, is deluſive.

                  <p>The inſults offered to this country, are without parallel.

                  <p>IT was my intention when I began theſe letters, to conſider the treaty in all its relations; but as the merchants and traders of Philadelphia, and the chambers of commerce of New York and Boſton have held up the idea of unimportance to our commerce, have deemed it a thing unworthy the attention of any other people than merchants, and not worth the riſk of diſpleaſing Great Britain, I will not differ with them, more eſpecially as the preſident has given them an excluſive privilege to think on this ſubject; but I will proceed to examine the conſtitutional and political features of this monſter of <hi>"horrid mien, that to be hated needs but to be ſeen."</hi> Not being in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of weighing my rights and my happineſs in <hi>a gold ſcales,</hi> I can the more readily diſmiſs the commercial conſideration of the treaty; and as a few merchants and traders have inſolently and preſumptuouſly monopolized the right to judge of things relating to commerce, they certainly will not deny others the excluſive privilege of deciding upon the conſtitutional and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical parts, of which they ſeem to be wholly ignorant. This is a <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> and has more reciprocity in it than the wifeſt and moſt profound of the addreſſers can point out in the treaty.</p>
                  <p>The unconſtitutional origin of the treaty, has been already ſhown in the <hi>"letters of Franklin,"</hi> to which I take the liberty to refer you, my fellow citizens, while I proceed to ſhow the unconſtitutionality of the inſtrument itſelf. The treaty has eſtabliſhed a rule of naturalization, within the precincts or ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the weſtern poſts, by which Britiſh ſubjects can become American citizens within any term of one year. The conſtitution expreſsly declares, that <hi>congreſs</hi> ſhall have power <hi>"<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> eſtabliſh an uniform rule of naturalization, throughout the United States."</hi> Here then the preſident and ſenate have not only uſurped the power of congreſs, to eſtabliſh a rule of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralization, but they have been guilty of a two-fold breach of the conſtitution, by making that rule not <hi>"uniform."</hi> During the laſt ſeſſion of the federal legiſlature, an <hi>uniform</hi> law of natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ization
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:028389_0724_0FD8EE8582646570"/>was paſſed, by which a <hi>five years reſidence</hi> is made ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to obtain citizenſhip; but this law has been ſuperſeded by treaty; and a Britiſh ſubject may become an American citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen in <hi>one week</hi> after the ſurrender of the poſts! The moſt deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate <hi>"Antifederaliſt"</hi> could not have aimed a more deadly blow at the conſtitution than the treaty has done; and if rendering the conſtitution a <hi>noſe of wax,</hi> can be called <hi>diſorganization, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobiniſm,</hi> or <hi>anarchy,</hi> the preſident and ſenate are the greateſt diſorganizers, the moſt furious Jacobins, and moſt violent anarchiſts, in the United States. If a compact, which ought to be held ſacred, and which ought to be conſtrued and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted ſtrictly, can be interpreted to mean any thing that floats in the mind, or flutters in the heart of the preſident, the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which we promiſed ourſelves is at an end, and we are lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in the ſituation of our new allies, Great Britain; we have a conſtitution in the clouds.</p>
                  <p>The conſtitution declares, that <hi>"Congreſs ſhall have power to diſpoſe of, and make all needful rules and regulations reſpecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States, or of any particular ſtate."</hi> By the treaty, the preſident and ſenate, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>"congreſs,"</hi> have made rules and regulations reſpecting the territory of the United States, and have prejudiced their claims, as well as the claims of individual ſtates. The 2d arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the treaty guarantees to <hi>"all ſettlers and traders, within the precincts or juriſdiction of the poſts, all their property of every kind."</hi> Part of this property belongs to the <hi>United States,</hi> and part to <hi>individual ſtates;</hi> and, notwithſtanding, the preſident and ſenate have made rules and regulations reſpecting it. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is ſolemnly prohibitory upon every department of the government, with reſpect to the claims of the United States, or of individual ſtates, when it declares, that <hi>"nothing in this conſtitution ſhall be ſo conſtrued as to prejudice any claims of the United States, or of any particular ſtate;"</hi> and in defiance of this ſolemn prohibition, this article was formed and ratified! The treaty of peace ſtipulated, that the poſts ſhould be ſurrendered with all convenient ſpeed; and from the date of the ratification of that treaty, all real property, not actually held by Britiſt ſubjects there, became veſted in the United States, and of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual ſtates; now, as a conſiderable part of the territory comprehended in the precincts or juriſdiction of the poſts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> taken poſſeſſion of by the Britiſh ſubjects <hi>ſince</hi> the treaty of peace, no department in the government could guarantee ſuch poſſeſſion; as the claims of the United States, and of individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſtates, became prejudiced thereby. Admitting a right to make
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:028389_0725_0FD8EE8B1B40FD60"/>rules and regulations reſpecting the territory of the United States, that right appertains excluſively to <hi>congreſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The conſtitution declares that "<hi>congreſs</hi> ſhall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the ſeveral ſtates, and <hi>with the Indian tribes.</hi>" By the 3d article of the treaty this power is aſſumed by the preſident and ſenate; for it declares, that "no duty of entry ſhal ever be levied by either party on peltries brought by land or inland navigation into the ſaid territories reſpectively, <hi>nor ſhall the Indians, poſſing or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing with their own proper goods and effects, of whatever nature, pay for the ſame any impoſt or duty whatever.</hi>" The power of <hi>congreſs</hi> to regulate commerce with the Indian tribes, is thus deſtroyed by a ſingle coup of the preſidential and ſenatorial hands.</p>
                  <p>By the conſtitution "the judical power of the United States ſhall be veſted in one ſupreme court, and in ſuch inferior courts as <hi>the congreſs</hi> may from time to time ordain and eſtabliſh." By the 6th article of the treaty, a judicial power is given to five commiſſioners, two of which are to be appointed by Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and <hi>"the award of the ſaid commiſſioners is to be final and concluſive, both as to the juſtice of the claim, and the amount of the ſum to be paid to the creditor, or claimant."</hi> Here is a judicial power given by <hi>the preſident and ſenate</hi> to five commiſſioners, <hi>two</hi> of whom are to be <hi>foreigners,</hi> and a third may alſo be a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner; and theſe commiſſioners are to have a final deciſion upon the property of the people of the United States. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs alone is given the eſtabliſhment of a judicial power; but even congreſs would hardly adventure ſo to profane the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, as to eſtabliſh a <hi>mongrel</hi> tribunal of <hi>foreigners</hi> and citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens. The <hi>preſident</hi> and <hi>ſenate,</hi> in the name of the United States, undertake "to cauſe the ſum awarded by the commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners to be paid in ſpecie to ſuch creditor or claimant without deduction, and at ſuch time or times, and at ſuch place or places as ſhall be awarded by the ſaid commiſſioners." The conſtitution declares, that <hi>"all bills for raiſing revenue ſhall ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginate in the houſe of repreſentatives,"</hi> and that <hi>"no money ſhall be drawn from the treaſury, but in conſequence of appropriations made by law."</hi> The ſituation in which the preſident and ſenate ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> placed the United States by this article, give them the power of raiſing revenue, and of making appropriations of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney according to their whim; for as a treaty is a ſolemn ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation between nation and nation, every infraction of that treaty is a ground of war. If then the houſe of repreſentatives refuſes to originate a revenue to carry this ſtipulation in the treaty, into effect, it may be conſidered as an infraction of the

Our veſſels ſhall pay in this trade, the ſame tonnage duty as is paid by Britiſh veſſels in our ports; and our cargoes on their importation and exportation ſhall pay no other or higher charges or duties than ſhall be payable on the ſame articles when imported or exported in Britiſh bottoms; but it is agreed that this trade ſhall be direct between the United States and the ſaid territories; that the article ſhall not be deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to allow the veſſels of the United States to carry on any part of the coaſting trade of the Britiſh territories in India, nor to allow our citizens to ſettle or reſide within the ſaid territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or to go into the interior parts thereof, without the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Britiſh local government there.</p>
                     <p>The Britiſh trade to their territories in the Eaſt Indies is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by a corporation, who have a monopoly againſt the great body of Britiſh mechants. Our trade to the ſame territories will be open to the ſkill and enter prize of every American citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen. The Britiſh trade to theſe territories is direct, but confined to the port of London; our trade to the ſame muſt likewiſe be direct, but may be carried on from and to all our principal ports.</p>
                     <p>The article gives us a right in common with the India com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to carry to theſe territories, and to purchaſe and bring from thence, all articles which may be carried to or purchaſed
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:028389_0731_0FD8EE969FC3AB08"/>and brought from the ſame, in Britiſh veſſels: our cargoes paying native duties, and our ſhips the ſame alien tonnage as Britiſh ſhips pay in our ports. This trade is equally open to both nations; except when Great Britain is engaged in war, when the conſent of the Britiſh local government is required in order to enable us to export naval ſtores, military ſtores, and rice; a limitation of ſmall conſequence: none of the articles except nitre being likely to form any part of our return cargoes. Though this article is one againſt which the objection of a want of reciprocity (ſo often, and ſo uncandidly urged againſt other parts of the treaty) has not been preferred, it has not however eſcaped cenſure.</p>
                     <p>It is ſaid that we are already in the enjoyment of a leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained commerce with the Britiſh territories in India, and that the treaty will alter it for the worſe: in as much as we thereby incapacitate ourſelves to carry on any part of the coaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing trade of the Britiſh territories in India, and as we relinquiſh the profitable freights to be made between Bombay and Canton, and likewiſe thoſe ſometimes obtained from the Engliſh territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in Bengal to Oſtend.</p>
                     <p>It would ſeem a ſufficient anſwer to ſay, that this trade has heretofore exiſted by the mere indulgence of thoſe who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it, that it was liable to variations, that a total excluſion, eſpecially had it been of us in common with other foreign na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, could have afforded no juſt ground of complaint: That the relaxation which has hitherto given us admiſſion to the Britiſh India territories, was not a permanent, but a mere tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary and occaſional regulation, liable to alteration, and by no means to be demanded as the baſis of an intercourſe to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted by compact, with a foreign nation, which would no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er leave the power of alteration in either of the parties.</p>
                     <p>But in reſpect to the firſt objection, the article amounts to this, that the rights which it does grant, ſhall not by implica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be conſtrued to give a right to carry on any part of the Britiſh coaſting trade in India.</p>
                     <p>If we have before ſhared in this trade by permiſſion, nothing in the article will preclude us from enjoying the ſame in future. If we did not participate in it, nothing in the article impairs either the authority of the Britiſh local government to permit our participation or our capacity to profit by ſuch permiſſion— This objection, therefore, falls to the ground, ſince the coaſting trade remains as it was before the treaty was formed.<note n="*" place="bottom">The terms uſed clearly denote this and nothing more; they are—"It is alſo underſtood that the <hi>permiſſion granted by this article</hi> is not to extend to <hi>allow.</hi>" This does not negative any pre-exiſting indulgence, but merely provides that the main grant ſhall not convert the <hi>revocable indulgence,</hi> if any there was in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, into an <hi>irrevocable right</hi> by treaty.</note>

Again—Surat, which is in the neighbourhood of Bombay, is the emporium of the Guzeat, and of the northern portion of the Malabar coaſt; the cottons ſhipped from Bombay to Canton, are frequently firſt ſent from Surat to Bombay. Surat belongs to the native powers to which we have free acceſs. If the tranſportation of cotton and ſome few other commodities from the coaſt of Malabar to Canton is an important branch of our commerce, what will prevent our proſecuting it from Surat or any other free port in the hither Indies?</p>
                     <p>That it may be undertaken from the ports of the native pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers is rendered probable, by the circumſtance, that theſe freights are ſupplied principally or alone by the native or black mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, whoſe reſidence would naturally be in the ports under native juriſdiction more frequently than in thoſe under the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of any of the foreign powers.</p>
                     <p>But is it not true (and will not candour admit it) that the trade to the Aſiatic dominions of the European powers has uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally been confined to the nation to whom ſuch territories be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long? In our treaty with Holland, have we not even ſtipulated to reſpect their monopoly of this trade?

                     <p>A late decree of the convention which opened to us the ports in their Weſt Indies, likewiſe laid open their remaining terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories in Aſia—But this meaſure proceeding from the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the war and their inability to carry on their foreign commerce, will change hereafter, as heretofore it has done, with the eſtabliſhment of peace—Did this opinion require to be ſtrengthened, it is abundantly confirmed by the navigation act, decreed by the convention: The operation whereof is ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended for the ſame reaſon that induced the opening to foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that trade to their colonies and territories in the Weſt and Eaſt Indies.</p>
                     <p>The Britiſh for more than a hundred years excluded foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from a ſhare in their Eaſt India trade; for a few years paſt
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:028389_0734_0FD8EE9EEE9798D8"/>they relaxed in the rigour of this ſyſtem. We have availed ourſelves of this circumſtance, and ſhared with them in their India commerce. But this permiſſion can be viewed only as an occaſional departure from a general law; which may be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a change of circumſtances, the duration of which, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is uncertain. The loſs and inconvenience to which our merchants may be expoſed from the proſecution of a trade, depending on regulations ariſing from inconſtant circumſtances, and which frequently vary, may, in ſome meaſure, be guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt, where the ſcene is not remote, and the alterations in the laws can be known ſoon after they are made. But in the Aſtatic and our other diſtant commerce, it is of importance that the laws under which an adventure is begun, ſhould be permanent. Loſſes to a conſiderable amount have been expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced by ſome of our merchants, who have undertaken diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant voyages in the expectation of the continuation of theſe temporary regulations. The trade, for example, to the Cape of Good Hope which the Dutch government ordinarily mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolize to their own people) was ſome time ſince opened to foreigners, and ſome of our citizens profited by it; but others who had engaged in large adventures to that market, ſuffered no ſmall diſappointment and loſs in finding themſelves excluded, upon their arrival by a repeal of the permiſſion to foreigners to trade there. It muſt then be conſidered as an important object ſecured, in reſpect to the principal proportion of our India trade, that alone which is capable of being purſued as a branch of our commerce, that the treaty turns a <hi>favor</hi> into a <hi>right,</hi> and that our direct intercourſe with the Britiſh territories in the Eaſt Indies, in all reſpects as broad as that of Great Britain herſelf (except in the articles of rice, naval and military ſtores, when Great Britain is engaged in war) inſtead of being an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain and hazardous trade, as heretofore, from its precarious nature, it has been, will, hereafter, be as certain as any in which our merchants ſhall engage.</p>
                     <p>It is further alleged, by way of objection to this article, that it does not ſecure to our citizens a right to reſide and ſettle in the Britiſh territories in India, without the conſent of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh local government. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ſervation that has been made on a ſimilar objection, in reſpect to the coaſting trade in India, is equally applicable to this. The article leaves ſubjects preciſely in the ſituation in which it found them. But let it be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered that the diſproportion between the numbers of the native Indians and the foreigners inhabiting their country, is more than one thouſand of the former to one of the latter—that the moſt exact diſcipline and ſubordination among the foreigners
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:028389_0735_0FD8EEA208041FC0"/>are therefore eſſential to the preſervation of the Britiſh authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty over that country—that no foreigner, or even a Britiſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, is allowed to reſide there, except in the character of a ſervant of the company, or of a licenſed inhabitant—that it has long been held as a ſound opinion, that unreſtrained liberty to the Europeans to emigrate to, and ſettle among the Indians, would, in a ſhort time, overturn and deſtroy the Britiſh empire in India—This danger would by no means be diminiſhed by conferring a right upon the Americans, freely to reſide and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in India—that we ſhall be allowed to reſide and ſettle there by permiſſion of the local Britiſh government, is fairly to be inferred from the article. But an abſolute right to an entire liberty on theſe points, might evidently be dangerous to the Britiſh government over India—and in prudence could not have been ſtipulated.</p>
                     <p>The advantageous footing, on which the trade is placed, is ſo evident, that thoſe who had no reliance on the objections urged againſt it, but who, nevertheleſs, have been unwilling to allow the treaty any merit on the ſcore of this article, have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſhow that our India trade is of little importance, and of ſmall value.</p>
                     <p>Whatever article can be ſupplied by the India company, may likewiſe be ſupplied by us, and ſome of them on better terms by us, than by them: The reports of the committee of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors of the Eaſt India company, publiſhed in 1793, when their charter was renewed, afford uſeful information on this ſubject, and diſcloſe facts which ſhow the advantages that we ſhall poſſeſs in this trade over the company. They admit, that in the articles of iron, wines, canvas, cordage, arms, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val and military ſtores, foreigners can enter into a ben<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Third. The European intercourſe with Aſia is, in moſt caſes, conducted by corporation or excluſive companies—and all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience has proved that in every ſpecies of buſineſs (that of bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and a few analagous employments excepted) in conducting of which, a competition ſhall exiſt between individuals and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations, the ſuperior economy, enterprize, zeal, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of the former, will make them an overmarch for the latter; and that while individuals acquire riches, corporations, engaged in the ſame buſineſs, often ſink their capital and become bankrupt. The Britiſh Eaſt India company are more overbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened with various terms and conditions, which they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to obſerve in their Aſiatic trade, and which operate as ſo many advantages in favor of their rivals in the ſupply of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign markets. The company, for example, are obliged annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to inveſt a large capital in the purchaſe of Britiſh manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be exported and ſold by them in India; the loſs on theſe inveſtments is conſiderable every year, as few of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures which they are obliged to purchaſe, will ſell in India for their coſt and charges—Beſides, from the policy of protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the home manufactures, the company are, in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſhut out from ſupplying India goods for the home con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of Great Britain. Moſt of the goods which they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port from India, are re-exported with additional charges, incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the regulations of the company, to foreign markets, in ſupplying of which we ſhall be their rivals, as from the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of intelligent merchants, it is a fact that Aſiatic goods, including the teas of China, are on average, cheaper within the United States than in Great Britain.</p>
                     <p>Fourth. The manufactures of Aſia are not only cheaper here than in Europe, but in general they are cheaper than goods of equal quality of European manufacture—So long as from the cheapneſs of ſubſiſtence and the immenſe population of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia (the inhabitants of the Britiſh territories only being eſtimated at forty millions) the labour of a manufacturer can be procured from two to three pence ſterling per day, the ſimilar manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Europe, aided with all their ingenious machinery, is likely, on a fair competition, in almoſt every inſtance, to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by thoſe of India. So apprehenſive have the Britiſh go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment been of endangering their home manufactures by the permiſſion of Aſiatic goods to be conſumed in Great Britain, that they have impoſed eighteen per cent, duties on the groſs ſales of all India muſlins, which is equal to twenty-two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, on their prime coſt: The duties on courſer India goods
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:028389_0738_0FD8EEA85A484580"/>are ſtill higher, and a long catalogue of Aſiatic articles, includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all ſtained and printed goods, is prohibited from being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed in Great Britain.</p>
                     <p>The Britiſh manufacturers were not ſatisfied even with this prohibitory ſyſtem—And on the late renewal of the company's charter, they urged the total excluſion from Britiſh conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all India goods, and moreover propoſed that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſhould be held to import annually from India a large amount of raw materials, and particularly cotton, for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of the Britiſh manufacturers.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe facts are noticed to ſhow the advantages to be derived from a free acceſs to the India market, from whence we may obtain thoſe goods which would be extenſively conſumed even in the firſt manufacturing nations of Europe, did not the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of their manufactories require their excluſion.<note n="*" place="bottom">Great Britain has made it a ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That no other or higher duty ſhall be exacted or paid, on the ſhips and merchandizes, nor on the articles of the growth, produce, or manufacture of one of the parties, on their entry or importation into the territories of the other, than ſhall be payable on the like ſhips, and merchandizes, and on ſimilar articles of the growth, produce, or manufacture of any other nation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That no article, the importation or exportation of which by either party, to or from the territories of the other, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, ſhall be imported or exported, to or from the ſame by any other foreign nation; and that every article allowed to be imported or exported to or from the territories of either party,
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:028389_0740_0FD8EEAD088A33F8"/>by any foreign nation, may be imported or exported to or from the ſame, by the parties reſpectively.</p>
                     <p>By theſe ſtipulations it is agreed, that the people and inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the United States and of the Britiſh dominions in Europe, ſhall have the right to carry on trade between the ſaid territories in all articles and commodities in which any other foreign nation may trade with either of the parties; that the impoſt or duties on any article in the courſe of ſuch trade, ſhall be no other or higher than the loweſt impoſts or duties paid by any other foreign nation on the like article; that both parties ſhall remain free, totally to prohibit the importation or export<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, to or from their reſpective territories, of any ſpecies of goods or merchandize, or to increaſe the exiſting duties, or to impoſe new ones on the importation of any ſpecies of goods or merchandizes, into their reſpective territories; ſuch prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and duties operating equally againſt all foreign nations. So far as reſpects the interchange of commodities between the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, theſe ſtipulations breathe the ſpirit of reciprocity: the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue of the fifteenth article principally relates to the navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the parties ſhall employ in this trade.</p>
                     <p>The firſt clauſe of the 15th article, in the ſpirit of thoſe treaties which mutually confer the right of the moſt favored na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſtipulates that no other or higher duties ſhall be paid by the ſhips of the one party in the ports of the other, than ſuch as are paid by the like veſſels of all other nations.</p>
                     <p>By our laws, a difference exiſts between the tonnage d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>By the Britiſh laws, the differences between the duties paid by Britiſh and foreign veſſels in the Britiſh ports in Europe, is leſs than that which exiſts in our ports:—the conſequence is that a Britiſh veſſel, of a given burden, pays conſiderably mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnage duties in the trade between our territories and the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh ports in Europe, than is paid by an American veſſel of the ſame burden, engaged in the ſame trade.</p>
                     <p>The trade being laid open to both parties, the principle o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> equalization of duties was very naturally deemed an equitable baſis of treaty. This could be effected by lowering the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican alien duties to the Britiſh ſtandard, or by raiſing thoſe of Great Britain to the American ſtandard. The former might
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:028389_0741_0FD8EEAF52903280"/>have been inconvenient to our revenue, eſpecially ſince, if it was not general, it would have formed, in reſpect to foreign nations, an unpleaſant diſcrimination in our laws.</p>
                     <p>The American tonnage duty, therefore, was left to operate; and by the 15th article is is agreed, that the Britiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall reſerve a right to raiſe the tonnage duty on our veſſels entering their ports in Europe, ſo as to make it <hi>equal</hi> to the tonnage duty payable by their veſſels entering our ports: And in order to balance the difference of duties on goods imported into our ports by American or by Britiſh veſſels, the effect whereof is the ſame as that which proceeds from an alien ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage duty, the article further agrees, that the Britiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall reſerve a right to impoſe ſuch duty as may be ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to effect this end. The preceding clauſe of this article ſtipulates, that the veſſels and cargoes of each ſhall pay no high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or other duties, than thoſe impoſed on the like veſſels and cargoes of all other nations; it was, therefore, neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a right to increaſe againſt us, their alien tonnage duty, and to impoſe the countervailing duty in queſtion; as, without ſuch reſervation, the ſame could not have been done, unleſs by laws equally operating againſt all other nations—which would have been unjuſt in reference to ſuch of them as might not, like us, have diſcriminated in their duties between their own and foreign veſſels.</p>
                     <p>Two methods have been ſuggeſted, by which this counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing power might be executed.</p>
                     <p>One by impoſing a <hi>pro rota</hi> duty on the importation of goods into the Britiſh ports in Europe by American veſſels, equal to the difference between the duties payable in our ports on the importation of goods by American or Britiſh veſſels.</p>
                     <p>The other, by impoſing the identical duty on the exportation of goods from the Britiſh ports in Europe, by American veſſels, which forms the difference between the duties payable on the importation of the ſame goods into our ports by American or Britiſh veſſels.</p>
                     <p>As the articles imported by our veſſels into the Britiſh ports in Europe, are diſſimilar from thoſe imported from the ſame into our ports, one rule of difference would not effect the equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ization ſought for; and as our difference of duties is not the ſame on all articles, being higher on ſome than on others—and as, moreover, the quantities and amount of different articles differ widely, and are liable to continual proportional variations, no uniform average rule of countervailing theſe differences can be deviſed; the correct execution, therefore, of this power, in
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:028389_0742_0FD8EEB0C4B6C1B0"/>the method firſt ſuggeſted, is impracticable, and, it is preſumed, muſt be diſcarded.</p>
                     <p>The power, then, it would ſeem, can only be equitably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed by impoſing on the articles which we ſhall export in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican veſſels from the Britiſh ports in Europe, a duty iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically the ſame as that which conſtitutes, in any caſe, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of duty payable in our ports, on the ſame articles im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from the Britiſh ports in Europe, by a Britiſh or Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican veſſel. Thus they may impoſe on tea and other Aſiatic goods, as well as on the European goods, which we ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port from the Britiſh ports in Europe, the identical duty or the ſame ſum which conſtitutes the difference of duties payable in our ports on the importation from thence of the ſame articles by an American or a Britiſh veſſel.</p>
                     <p>The right to countervail our alien tonnage duty by impoſing an alien tonnage duty on our veſſels entering the Britiſh ports in Europe, equal to that which ſhall be payable on their veſſels entering our ports, will continue ſo long as the commercial treaty ſhall endure, and will apply to any future increaſe of the tonnage duty on foreign veſſels that we may eſtabliſh; it is however ſtipulated in the concluſion of the fifteenth article, that we ſhall abſtain from increaſing the tonnage duty on Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh veſſels, and alſo from increaſing the difference that now exiſts between the duties payable on the importation of any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles into our ports in Britiſh or in American veſſels, until the expiration of two years after the termination of the war be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween France and Great Britain. But we are free to increaſe the one or the other, after the expiration of that period; and though the Britiſh government will have a right to countervail, by additional tonnage duties, on our veſſels, any increaſe of that duty on their veſſels; yet they will have no right to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervail any increaſe of the difference between the duties payable on the importation of any articles into our ports, in Britiſh or in American veſſels, unleſs by a duty common to all foreign nations; the right reſerved on this ſubject, being confined to the difference that <hi>now</hi> exiſts, will not reach ſuch future in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.<note n="*" place="bottom">How r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

1. As, for the purpoſe of encouraging or protecting the agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture and manufactures of Great Britain, ſeveral of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, in common with ſimilar productions of the other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are prohibited from being imported into the Britiſh ports in Europe; we are free, whenever our intereſt ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it, alſo to exclude any of the productions of the Britiſh dominions from being imported into our ports, extending ſuch excluſions, as they do, to the like manufactures and producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of foreign nations.</p>
                     <p>Should that part of the twelfth article, which has not been ratified, in its modification retain the ſtipulation relative to the importation of coffee, ſugar, and the other productions of the Weſt Indies, it would conſtitute an exception to this propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But as the Weſt India productions are diſſimilar to thoſe of our own country, they would not fall within the reaſon of theſe prohibitions, and, therefore, the exception would be of no conſequence.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As, for the like reaſons, ſome of our productions are ſubject, in common with the like productions of other nations, to high, or prohibitory duties in the Britiſh ports in Europe, we are free, likewiſe, to impoſe ſimilar duties on any of the productions or manufactures of the Britiſh dominions, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch duties, as they do, to the like productions and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures of other foreign nations.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. As the navigation act of Great Britain, in order to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their own ſhipping, has heretofore confined the importati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of foreign productions into the Britiſh ports, to Britiſh ſhips, and to the ſhips of the country producing the ſame; the 15th article appears to contain an important innovation on this ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated act; inaſmuch as, by the moſt obvious conſtruction of the terms, it gives us a right to import from our own territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries into the Britiſh ports in Europe every article and deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of goods and merchandizes, which any nation in their own ſhips is allowed to import—In conſequence whereof, while all other foreign nations are prohibited and reſtrained from import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their own veſſels into Great Britain any goods or mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes, except thoſe of their own particular growth, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, or manufacture, we, by the treaty, have a right to carry from our ports to the Britiſh ports in Europe, not only goods and merchandizes of our own growth, produce, or manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but alſo all ſuch goods and merchandizes, the growth, produce; or manufacture of any foreign nation, as a nation producing or manufacturing the ſame, would import in their veſſels into Great Britain.</p>

4. Should it ever be politic to exclude all foreign veſſels from importing, or exporting, any ſpecies of goods, wares, or merchandizes, by confining their importation or exportation to our own veſſels; we are perfectly free to do ſo; with the exception, relative to the Weſt India productions, referred <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>That theſe articles of the treaty leave our navigation and commerce as free, and ſecure to us as extenſive advantages as have before been procured by our commercial treaties with fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign nations, will be ſeen by the following compariſon:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By the articles before us, the parties reſtrain themſelves from impoſing any other or higher duties on the veſſels and cargoes of each other, than they impoſe on the veſſels and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes of all other nations; and alſo from impoſing a prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the importation or exportation of any article to or from the territories of each other, which ſhall not extend to all other nations.

                        </gap>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, it is ſtipulated, that the ſubjects and citizens of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective parties, ſhall pay, in the ports, havens, and places of each other, no other or greater duties or impoſts, of whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver nature they may be, than thoſe which the nations moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored ſhall be obliged to pay: and moreover, that they ſhall enjoy all the rights, liberties, privileges and exemptions is trade, navigation, and commerce, which the ſaid nations do, or ſhall enjoy: and by the 2d article of the former, and the 26th article of the latter treaty, the parties agree mutually, not to grant any particular favor, in reſpect to navigation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The ſtipulations in the three treaties are, on theſe points, equivalent.</p>
                     <p>The 2d and 3d articles of our treaty with Holland, and the 3d and 4th of our treaty with Sweden, likewiſe contain mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſtipulations, that the ſubjects and citizens of the ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhall pay in the ports, havens, and places of their reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive countries, no other or higher duties or impoſts than thoſe which the nations moſt favored ſhall pay; and that they ſhall enjoy all the rights, liberties, privileges, and exemptions in trade and navigation, which the ſaid nations ſhall enjoy.</p>

2. The articles before us, after ſtipulating that there ſhall be between our territories and the Britiſh dominions in Europe, a reciprocal and perfect liberty of commerce, declare, that the ſame ſhall be ſubject always to the laws of the reſpective coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. The introductory articles of our treaties with France, Holland, and Sweden, after aſſerting the intentions of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to take equality and reciprocity as their baſis, likewiſe leave each party at liberty to form ſuch regulations reſpecting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and navigation as it ſhall find convenient to itſelf—and the 2d and 3d articles of our treaty with Pruſſia, after ſtipulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rights of the parties, reſpecting the duties and impoſts, and the freedom of their navigation and trade, likewiſe require their ſubmiſſion to the laws and uſages eſtabliſhed in the two countries.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The articles before us, in their proviſions relative to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, ſtipulate, as has been already obſerved, in common with our other treaties, that the ſhips of the parties ſhall not be ſubject to higher or other duties, than thoſe paid by all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nations. They go farther, and agree to vary this rule, ſo far as ſhall be neceſſary to equalize the tonnage duty impoſed by the parties on the ſhips of each other. Our treaty with France is the only one in which we diſcover a ſimilar ſtipulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.—France had a high alien tonnage duty on all foreign veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels tranſporting the merchandize of France from one port to another port in her dominions. We had a leſs alien tonnage duty on foreign ſhips employed in a ſimilar trade: though not equally extenſive; the caſe is parallel to that which exiſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and Great Britain. We have a high alien tonnage duty on all foreign veſſels entering our ports; Great Britain has a leſs alien tonnage duty on foreign veſſels entering her ports. In our treaty with France we reſerve a right to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervail the alien tonnage duty impoſed by France; and in like manner, in our treaty with Great Britain, ſhe reſerves a right to countervail the alien tonnage duty impoſed by us. The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, in both inſtances, has been to place the navigation of the parties on the footing of exact equality.</p>
                     <p>The preceding expoſition of theſe articles, illuſtrated by the compariſon of their proviſions, with the analagous articles of our other treaties, would be ſufficient to vindicate them againſt the objections to which they have been expoſed.—It is, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, thought adviſeable to take notice of ſuch of theſe objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as are likely to have any influence on the public opinion— This will be done in a ſubſequent number.</p>

The reaſon adduced by Cato to ſupport his conſtruction is equally defective with his interpretation itſelf. The fourteenth article is in general terms, and ſimilar, as has been ſhown, to the introductory articles of other treaties; ſo far from the laſt clauſe thereof being capable of deſtroying the preceding ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; it is the peculiar province of the next article to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the points which the parties mutually agree to except from their legiſlative power. In all caſes not thus excepted, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation and commerce of the parties is ſubject to their exiſting or future laws.</p>
                     <p>It is not neceſſary to remark on the ſeveral objections which have proceeded from the opinion that the treaty reſtrains us from impoſing prohibitory duties and excluſions: they are but ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of the error that has been juſt combatted.</p>
                     <p>Another objection which has been ſtated by ſeveral writers, and much laboured by Cato, is, that under the right reſerved to the Britiſh government to countervail an alien tonnage duty, by the impoſition of an equivalent one on our veſſels entering their ports, they would gain and we ſhould loſe.</p>
                     <p>Several methods are adopted to prove this opinion. The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation that we have a tonnage duty on our own veſſels, and that Great Britain has none, is repeated by way of objection againſt this as well as againſt the propoſed adjuſtment contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the 12th article. The ſame reply already given might be ſufficient in this place.</p>
                     <p>But is it true that Britiſh ſhips entering their own ports in Europe are wholly free from a tonnage duty? the contrary is the fact; ſince it is underſtood, that they pay a tonnage duty for the ſupport of light houſes, and ſome other inſtitutions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with their navigation, which, in all their ports, exceeds the tonnage duty of ſix cents per ton, that we levy on the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of our own veſſels employed in foreign trade. But Great Britain (it is alleged) will not only impoſe in virtue of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved right, fifty cents per ton on our veſſels entering her ports, but in every port except that of London, ſhe will further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more exact one ſhilling and nine pence ſterling, or thirty nine cents per ton, for light money and Trinity-dues more than is paid by her own veſſels; this, added to the difference before ſtated, would have, it is ſaid, a very diſcouraging effect upon our navigation. Our tonnage duty is a tax not divided and appropriated, like the light money, or Trinity-dues, in Great Britain, to ſpecific, and particular objects—but when levied, goes into the treaſury with the duty of impoſt, and ſtands ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to the various objects to which that duty is appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated—among thoſe objects is the ſupport of light-houſes—it is
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:028389_0748_0FD8EEC387DB1BC0"/>not the object to which the tax is applied that gives a denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; whether it goes to ſupport the civil liſt, or to pay an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuities, or to maintain light houſes, or to ſupport hoſpitals, it is equally a tonnage duty. A tonnage duty then of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain amount, is now paid by American veſſels entering the ports of Great Britain. This duty is not uniform, being leſs in London than in the other ports, and, in ſome inſtances, leſs than the tonnage duty paid by Britiſh ſhips entering our ports—The object of this clauſe (8th of the 15th article) is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> equalize the alien tonnage duties of the parties. Hence the reſervation of a right to the Britiſh government, to impoſe on our veſſels entering their ports in Europe, a tonnage duty equal to that which ſhall be payable by Britiſh veſſels in our ports. It would be againſt the manifeſt views of the parties as well as againſt the explicit terms of the article, to impoſe a tonnage duty (whether for light money, Trinity dues, or any other purpoſe) which ſhould exceed that which ſhall be paya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by Britiſh veſſels in our ports.</p>
                     <p>The right reſerved is expreſsly to impoſe on our veſſels as equal, not a greater tonnage duty than we ſhall impoſe on their veſſels. This objection, therefore, muſt be abandoned.</p>
                     <p>But again, it is urged, that our navigation, ſhould it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The countervailing right is not applicable to the whole duty payable on goods and merchandizes imported into our ports in Britiſh ſhips, but expreſsly confined to the difference of duty now payable on the ſame when imported by American or by Britiſh veſſels—This difference is one-tenth part of the duty upon all European goods, that is to ſay, theſe goods pay one-tenth part more duty when imported in Britiſh veſſels than is paid on the ſame when imported in an American veſſel; in all caſes, therefore, where our impoſt is ten per cent. ad valorem, the difference of duty to be countervailed amounts to only one per cent. on the value of the goods, inſtead of ten percent. as is alleged by Cato; in the inſtance of teas imported from Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope the difference is greater: again it is not an aggregate ſum, that is to be apportioned under this countervailing right, for this ſum would be liable to conſtant variation according to the quantity and ſpecies of goods imported into our ports from time to time by Britiſh veſſels; and beſides, the Britiſh government poſſeſs no means whereby the amount thereof could be aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                     <p>Cato feels and admits the force of theſe remarks as deciſive againſt an average duty, without perceiving that they poſſeſs equal ſtrength againſt his project of countervailing the whole duty paid on the importation of goods and merchandizes into our ports by Britiſh veſſels; for the ſame variation in the amount, and the ſame want of the means to aſcertain it, will operate in both caſes. The reaſons which he himſelf employs to prove that an average duty cannot be aſcertained, equally ſhow the impracticability of the method which he conſiders as the one that will be employed in the execution of the countervailing right reſerved to the Britiſh government. It has before been ſtated, that the natural as well as the equitable mode of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting this power will be to impoſe a duty on the goods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by us from their European ports exactly the ſame as makes the difference of duty on the importation thereof into our ports by American or by Britiſh veſſels.</p>
                     <p>Admitting that the execution of the countervailing right reſerved to Great Britain will do no more than place the navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the parties on an equal footing in their mutual inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, ſtill we are told that for this, likewiſe, the treaty is blameable, becauſe even equality will be ſuch an advantage to our rival, that we ſhall be unable to maintain the competition.</p>
                     <p>This objection brings with it a quality rarely to be diſcovered in the opinions of the cavillers againſt the treaty. Their uſual error is a falſe and magnified eſtimate of the comparative re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources, ſtrength and importance of our country; in this inſtance,
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:028389_0750_0FD8EEC897C47130"/>ſhifting their ground, they fall into the oppoſite extreme, and contend for our inferiority in a branch of buſineſs in the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is not only the difference in the firſt coſt, but to this ſhould be added the difference of intereſt and inſurance, the annual amount whereof is aſcertained by the value of the ſhips.</p>
                     <p>If we add to this, the comparative advantages that we poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs in victualling and manning our veſſels, independent of the acknowledged and diſtinguiſhed ſkill and enterprize of our ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, it may be ſafely affirmed, that no American who knows the character of his countrymen, and who is not ignorant of our peculiar reſources for ſhip-building, will doubt our ſuperiority in an equal and fair competition with any other nation.</p>
                     <p>It is further alleged, that the treaty wants reciprocity, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the whole territory of the United States is laid open to the Britiſh navigation and commerce, while, in return, the Britiſh territories, <hi>in Europe only,</hi> are opened to us. The ſhort anſwer to this allegation is, that it is not true.—All the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh territories in Europe are laid open to us; all their territories in Aſia are alſo opened to us; the treaty likewiſe opened all their territories in the Weſt Indies. The article relative to this branch of trade, as has already been obſerved, is excepted from the ratification of the treaty, and made the ſubject of future negociation. The Britiſh territories on our continent, that of the Hudſon's Bay company excepted, are alſo opened to us in like manner as ours are opened to them. The intercourſe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined on both ſides to the interior communications, the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of thoſe colonies being equally deſtitute of a right to reſort, by ſea, with their ſhips to our ports and harbours as we are of the right to reſort, by ſea, with our ſhips to their ports and harbours.</p>
                     <p>The territory of the Hudſon's Bay company, the iſland of Newfoundland and the eſtabliſhments on the coaſt of Africa, are the only Britiſh dominions to which the treaty, in its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal form does not give a right of intercourſe and trade.</p>
                     <p>The ſettlement in the Bay of Honduras is on Spaniſh lands, and the right of precedence is conceded for ſpecified objects, beyond which the Spaniſh government are vigilant to reſtrain the ſettlers.</p>
                     <p>Spain may poſſibly be induced to allow us a right in common with Great Britain, to cut mahogany and die woods in this region; but Great Britain cannot, conſiſtently with her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention with Spain, ſhare with us the privilege that ſhe enjoys,</p>

Admitting the truth of this objection, it might be replied: So on the other hand, Great Britain can form no commercial treaty, whereby, for an advantage yielded on her part, ſhe may acquire ſome privilege in return, unleſs ſhe yields the ſame advantage to us gratuitouſly and without receiving from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> equivalent; and as Great Britain, whoſe commercial rela<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                           <desc>••••</desc>
                        </gap>s are equally extenſive with ours, and whoſe capital far exceeds ours, is equally reſtrained on this point, our chance of gain would be fully equal to our chance of loſs.</p>
                     <p>But the allegation is not generally true, and the objection, when examined, will be found to be of little weight, even with thoſe who may imagine that nations do ſometimes make good bargains by the purchaſe of privileges and exemptions in their foreign trade. The caſe that has been choſen to enforce the objection, ſhall be employed to invalidate it.</p>
                     <p>Admit that the treaty with Great Britain is in operation— that the oil and proviſion merchants of the United States, and the wine and brandy merchants of France are deſirous of a treaty between the two countries, whereby thoſe commodities ſhall be received from each other on low duties or freely—ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit farther, that the governments of the two nations are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to make ſuch a treaty (this is the caſe again put by the oppoſers of the treaty as impracticable) what will reſtrain the concluſion of this treaty? The diſadvantage that will ariſe from our treaty with Great Britain? No, for Britain produces nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wines, nor brandy made from wines, with which ſhe could ſupply us; ſhe therefore could gain nothing, nor ſhould we loſe any thing by the concluſion of ſuch a treaty. All that will be requiſite, therefore, in the formation of ſuch treaties, will be to chooſe for the purpoſe ſuch articles of the growth, manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture, or produce of any country with whom we deſire to treat as are not common to it and the Britiſh dominions, and any ſkilful merchant will quickly make the ſelection—Hence it appears that the objection is not well founded in point of fact.</p>
                     <p>But though it may be practicable, will it be politic in us to conclude no commercial treaties of this character with any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? If we reſort to precedents as guides, we ſhall diſcover few, the hiſtory of which would encourage us. Indeed they are a deſcription of conventions not often formed between na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>They are of difficult adjuſtment, and neceſſarily increaſe the proviſions of the commercial code, ſufficiently intricate, when only one rule prevails in reſpect to all nations. Beſides, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever perfect may be the right of nations in this reſpect, yet
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:028389_0754_0FD8EED2B065B988"/>when the productions of one nation are received at lower du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, than the like productions of another, the diſcrimination will ſcarcely fail to awaken deſires and to produce diſſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from their diſappointment.</p>
                     <p>Again, unleſs we are prepared, at the expenſe of the whole to procure advantages or privileges for a part of the community, we ſhall doubt the policy of ſuch ſtipulations. Between two ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturing nations, in each of which the manufactures have attained to great perfection—a tariff of duties may be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by treaties, in the payment of which the manufactures of the two countries might be freely exchanged and mutually confirmed; ſuch was the commercial treaty between France and Great Britain in the year 1786.

By the treaty of commerce between France and Great Britain, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in 1786, it was agreed, that the wines of France im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into Great Britain ſhould pay no higher duties than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

This is an inſtance of inconvenience and loſs, reſulting from the ſpecies of treaties, which it is alleged as an objection to the treaty concluded between us and
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:028389_0755_0FD8EED46099DEF8"/>Great Britain, that we are prevented by it from making with other nations.</p>
                     <p>A ſmall compact nation, likewiſe, who excel in ſome one ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of manufacture, that is eſtabliſhed throughout their ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory, and in the conducting and ſucceſs whereof there is a common intereſt, may find it uſeful to procure the excluſive ſupply of ſome foreign market: provided, in this as in all other bargains, the compenſation ſhall not be too high. But in a nation like ours, compoſed of different ſtates, varying in cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, productions, manufactures, and commercial purſuits, it will be more difficult to enter into treaties of this kind. Should Great Britain, for example, be inclined to admit our fiſh oils freely, or on payment of low duties on condition that we would receive their woollens or hardware freely or on payment of low duties—would the middle and ſouthern ſtates be ſatisfied with ſuch a treaty?—would they agree to a tax on their eſtates ſufficient to ſupply the deficiency in the revenue ariſing from the relinquiſhment of the impoſt on Britiſh woollens or hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware? Would it not be ſaid, that ſuch a tax was a bounty out of the common treaſury, on a particular branch of buſineſs purſued alone by a portion of the citizens of a ſingle ſtate in the union? Inſtances might be multiplied in the illuſtration of this ſubject; but they will readily occur to every man who will purſue a little detail in his reflections. We have once made an experiment of this kind—its fate ſhould ſerve as a caution to us in future. By the eleventh and twelfth articles of our treaty with France, it was agreed, that France ſhould never impoſe any duty on the melaſſes that we ſhould export from the French Weſt Indies; and in compenſation of this exemption, that we ſhould never impoſe any duty on the exportation of any kind of merchandize by Frenchmen, from our territories, for the uſe of the French Weſt Indies. Theſe articles produced much diſſatisfaction in congreſs: It was ſaid to be a benefit that would enure to the uſe and advantage of only a part, but which muſt be compenſated by the whole. Thoſe arguments which will ſhow themſelves in future, ſhould ſimilar conventions be formed, were diſplayed on this occaſion. The treaty was rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, congreſs applied to the king of France to conſent to annul theſe articles—this requeſt was granted—and the articles were, by the ſeveral acts of the parties, annulled.</p>
                     <p>Not only the few inſtances of the exiſtence of theſe treaties among the nations, added to the peculiar difficulties which we muſt meet in their formation, ſhould lead us to doubt their utility, but alſo the opinion of our own country, which, if ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:028389_0756_0FD8EED5D79AC920"/>on any point, has been repeatedly ſo in the condemnation of this ſpecies of national compact.</p>
                     <p>The introductory article of our commercial treaty with France, aſſerts, that the parties willing to fix on an equitable and permanent manner, the rules which ought to be followed relative to their correſpondence and commerce "have judged that the ſaid end could not be better obtained, than by taking for the baſis of their agreement the moſt perfect equality and reciprocity, and by carefully avoiding all thoſe burden ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences which are uſually ſources of debate, embarraſſment and diſcontent."</p>

                     <p>The agreement that either party may puniſh, diſmiſs, or ſend back a conſul for illegal or improper conduct, is calculated to prevent national miſunderſtandings, and to ſecure a reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:028389_0757_0FD8EED7368BB308"/>deportment in the conſular corps. I have not obſerved that this article has been diſapproved of from any quarter.</p>
                     <p>The ſeventeenth article which reſpects the capture and deten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the veſſels of the parties on juſt ſuſpicion of having on board enemy's property, or contraband of war, has been the object of intemperate cenſure—with how much juſtice it ſhall be the buſineſs of this paper to examine.</p>
                     <p>The principal complaint, is not, that the article expoſed our own property to loſs by capture, for this is not the caſe, but that it does not protect enemy's property on board our veſſels. The defence of the article will reſt upon the proofs which ſhall be exhibited, that it is in conformity with, and ſupported by, the clear and acknowledged law of nations—that law which pronounces that enemy's goods on the high ſeas are liable to capture, and as a neceſſary mean to this end, that neutral ſhips are there liable to examination or ſearch.</p>
                     <p>The law of nature (as heretofore obſerved) applicable to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals in their independent or unſocial ſtate, is what, when applied to collections of individuals in ſociety, conſtitutes the natural or neceſſary law of nations. An individual in a ſtate of nature, for reparation of injuries, or in defence of his perſon and property, has a right to ſeize the property of his enemy, and to deſtroy his perſon.</p>
                     <p>Nations always ſucceed to the rights that the individuals who compoſed them enjoyed in a ſtate of nature: and hence it is that by the law of nations, from the earlieſt annals of ſociety, the goods or property of one enemy has been conſidered as liable to be ſeized and applied to the uſe of another. This right muſt be ſo uſed as not to injure the rights of others: Subject to this limitation, it is perfect, and an interruption of it by another is an injury. As in a conteſt between two individuals in a ſtate of nature, no third has a right, without becoming a party in the controverſy, to protect the property, or defend the perſon of either of the parties: So in a war between two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions no third nation can act out of its own juriſdiction, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the duties of neutrality; or, without becoming a party in the war, protect the property of, or defend either of the parties. Though nations are, in reſpect to each other, like individuals in a ſtate of nature, the reſemblance is not in every particular perfect—Individuals in a ſtate of nature have not only the inferior dominion or private ownerſhip of property, but the entire and perfect dominion over it. In ſociety the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter right belongs excluſively to the nation, while the former belongs to the ſeveral members that compoſe it. Immoveable things, ſuch as lands, which are denominated the territory
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:028389_0758_0FD8EEDB938909A0"/>of a nation, are the immediate and ſpecial objects of this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect dominion or paramount property. Moveable things are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The main ocean not being within the territory, or ſubject to the excluſive dominion or any nation, is a place, where enemy goods may lawfully be captured. An impediment by
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:028389_0759_0FD8EEDD0E3350A0"/>any third nation to the exerciſe of the right of capture on the ocean by either of the belligerent parties, would be an injury.</p>
                     <p>As the goods of an enemy, within the territory of a neutral ſtate, are under the protection thereof, the law of nations, for the reaſons that have been ſtated, will not permit us to take them: in like manner, we have no right to take them if they are on board a ſhip, whilſt the ſhip is in a neutral port, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſhip itſelf is a neutral one, or belongs to an enemy, becauſe the port is a part of the territory.—When the goods of an enemy are on board the ſhip of an enemy, and the ſhip is in the main ocean, there is no doubt of our right to capture both the goods and the ſhip, becauſe they are then in a place which is not the territory of any nation. But when the goods of an enemy are on board a neutral ſhip, and the ſhip is in the main ocean, though we have a right to take the goods, we have no right to take the ſhip, or to detain her any longer, than is neceſſary to obtain poſſeſſion of the goods—for the ocean itſelf is no territory—and neutral ſhips, as they are moveable goods, can not be parts of the neutral territory; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently are no more under the protection of the neutral ſtate, than the ſame goods would be, if they were paſſing through an unoccupied country in neutral carriages, or on neutral horſes.</p>
                     <p>A neutral ſhip (ſays Rutherford in his inſtitutes, whoſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning on this queſtion I adopt) may indeed be called a <hi>neutral place;</hi> but when we call it ſo, the word <hi>place</hi> does not mean territory, it only means the thing in which the goods are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. Though the goods of the enemy had been on board a ſhip belonging to the enemy, we might have ſaid, in the ſame ſenſe, that they were in a neutral place, if they had been lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up there in a neutral cheſt. But no one would imagine, that ſuch a neutral place, as a cheſt, can be conſidered as a part of the territory of the neutral ſtate, or that it would protect the goods. Notwithſtanding, a neutral cheſt is as much a neutral place as a neutral ſhip.</p>
                     <p>A ſhip, though a moveable thing, is under the juriſdiction of a nation whilſt it continues in one of its ports—but as ſoon as it is out at ſea, only the private ownerſhip, or inferior do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, of the ſhip remains, and it ceaſes to be under the dominion or juriſdiction of the nation. The caſe will be the ſame, if, inſtead of ſuppoſing the ſhip to be the property of a merchant, we ſuppoſe it to be the property of the nation.</p>
                     <p>For though we cannot well call the property which <hi>the nation</hi> has in ſuch a ſhip, by the name of private ownerſhip: yet, when the ſhip comes into the main ocean, the juriſdiction or

When I have merely a right to acquire property in a thing that is common to all mankind, but cannot do it without the uſe of what is already the property of ſome other man; this man neither does me an injury, nor encourages or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects others who have injured me, by excluding me from the uſe of what belongs to him. But when we have a right in war, upon account of the damage which the enemy has done us, to take goods of the enemy, and theſe are in a neutral ſhip: if the neutral ſtate, though it has property in the ſhip, ſhould make uſe of its right of property to protect the goods againſt us, this protection makes it an acceſſary to the injury, which is the foundation of the claim upon the enemy to obtain reparation of damages, and conſequently is inconſiſtent wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But whilſt this anſwer removes one difficulty, it brings ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If a neutral nation makes itſelf acceſſary to the damages done by the enemy, by protecting ſuch enemy goods as ſhe has a right to take for reparation of damages, when theſe goods are out at ſea in one of its ſhips: Why might the ſame nation, without becoming in like manner an acceſſary, protect the ſame goods when the ſhip is in one of its ports, or when the goods are on land within its territory? A law of nations, which is natural as to the matter of it, and poſitive only as to the objects of it, will furniſh an anſwer to this queſtion.</p>
                     <p>Every ſtate has, by univerſal acknowledgment and conſent, by the law of nations, an excluſive juriſdiction over its own territory. As long, therefore, as a ſtate keeps within its own territory, and exerciſes its juriſdiction there, the protection its queſtion is not a violation of our rights—but when its ſhips are in the main ocean; as they are then in a place out of its territory, where, by the law of nations, it has no juriſdiction, this law will allow us to take notice of the protection, which it gives to the goods of an enemy, and to conſider it as an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>In reſpect to the right of examination or ſearch, if the end it lawful, and the examination or ſearch a neceſſary mean to attain this end, the inference is inevitable, that the examination or ſearch i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> likewiſe lawful.</p>
                     <p>If the queſtion, whether enemy goods are ſeizable on board a neutral ſhip, were really doubtful; yet the right to ſearch neutral ſhips muſt be admitted for another reaſon. All agree that arms, ammunition and other contraband articles, may not be carried to an enemy by a neutral power—without ſearching veſſels at ſea, ſuch ſupply could not be prevented. The right
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:028389_0762_0FD8EEE4C66DFB18"/>to ſearch, therefore, reſults, likewiſe, from the right to ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> contraband goods. Again, the ſtate of war authorizes the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of enemy ſhips and goods—But on the main ocean, which is the great high-way where the ſhips and goods of all nations paſs; how are the ſhips and goods of an enemy to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from thoſe of a friend? No other way than by exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and ſearch. Hence then the right of ſearch is deducible from the general right to capture the ſhips and goods of an enemy.</p>

                     <p>A nation may advance its intereſt perhaps by forming ſuch a treaty, with one nation, and injure it by forming it with
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:028389_0765_0FD8EEEC126A7E28"/>another—Becauſe a nation has, in ſome inſtances, or for a limited time, formed ſtipulations of this ſort, it cannot from thence be inferred, that it has thereby, in any ſenſe, expreſſed its conſent to a total repeal of a law, the operation of which it has agreed to ſuſpend only for a limited time, and in reſpect to a particular nation. Commercial treaties, in which we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover theſe ſtipulations, though not always, are commonly limited in their duration. This limitation is a ſtrong argument againſt the doctrine which theſe treaties are cited to eſtabliſh. For ſo many years, ſay the parties, we will ſuſpend the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the law. When the treaty expires by its proper limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or is diſſolved by war, the rule of the treaty ceaſes, and the law is again in force between the parties, and, preſcribes to them, in common with other nations, their rights and duties in this reſpect.</p>
                     <p>The law of nations, that authorizes the capture of enemy goods in neutral ſhips, requires the reſtoration of neutral goods captured in enemy ſhips: The treaties, which ſtipulate that free ſhips make free goods, ſtipulate alſo that enemy ſhips make enemy goods. I have diſcovered no inſtance of the former ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, that has not been accompanied by the latter: though I have found inſtances of the latter ſtipulation unaccompanied by the former.—This is the caſe in the treaty of peace, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and alliance between Spain and England, concluded at Madrid in 1667. Thoſe, therefore, who contend that the law of nations has been repealed in one inſtance, muſt alſo inſiſt that it has been repealed in the other.—If the number of ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulations is to be received as evidence, the proof is ſtronger of a repeal in the latter than in the former caſe.—But will any one ſeriouſly maintain, that a nation would have a right to confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the goods of a neutral power found on board an enemy ſhip, without an expreſs ſtipulation on the part of ſuch neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral ſtate conſenting to the ſame?—Would England or Spain, for example, have a right to confiſcate American property captured in a French ſhip? Would America <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                           <desc>••••</desc>
                        </gap>var, have a right to confiſcate the neutral property of Spain, Portugal, Denmark, or Ruſſia, found on board an enemy ſhip? Has any nation ever confiſcated property under this circumſtance? If not, the inference is clear, that theſe ſtipulations are excluſively relative to the parties who form them, and that the rights of other ſtates remain under the protection of the law of nations.</p>
                     <p>But according to Cato, this reaſoning may be juſt, yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applicable; for he maintains that <hi>all nations</hi> have conſented to the eſtabliſhment of this conventional law. "As far back as 150 years," ſays this writer, "and ever ſince, I find that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:028389_0766_0FD8EEEC14BB4FE0"/>nations have ſtipulated in their treaties, that free ſhips ſhall make free goods, that full credit ſhall be given to ſhips papers, and that armed veſſels ſhall not come within cannon ſhot of a neutral ſhip, but ſend their boats on board with only two or three men at moſt, to examine papers, but <hi>not to ſearch,</hi> and that the treaties (by which is underſtood all the treaties) for 150 years back, relative to this object, are drawn in the words of the treaty between the United States and France."</p>
                     <p>Struck with the fulneſs of this aſſertion, I have carefully examined ſuch collections of treaties, as I have been able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, and going back to the year 1645, I have given a patient ſearch to all the public conventions between Great Britain and the ſeveral powers of Europe ſince that period.

                     <p>In relation to the full credit to be given to ſhips' papers, and the manner of boarding neutral veſſels,—in the treaties with
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:028389_0767_0FD8EEF0F235CA50"/>Spain, France, and Holland, it is ſtipulated, that full faith ſhall be given to the paſſports, and that the boarding ſhall be by two or three men only. But the treaties with Portugal and Ruſſia are deſtitute of any ſtipulation on this ſubject, except that in the latter it is agreed,<note n="*" place="bottom">Treaty of 1776, article 10.</note> that "the ſearching of merchant ſhips ſhall be as favorable as the reaſon of the war can poſſibly admit, toward the moſt favored neutral nation, obſerving, as near as may be, the principles of the law of nations that are generally acknowledged."<note n="†" place="bottom">Treaty with Dantzic of 1706, article 20.</note> In the treaties with Dantzic, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, and Sweden, paſſports are required for the purpoſe of diſtinguiſhing, according to the ſolemnities of thoſe treaties, the enemy property on board the ſhips of the parties; and it is ſtipulated, that credit ſhall be given to ſuch paſſports, except in caſes of juſt and urgent cauſe of ſuſpicion, when, ſay theſe treaties, the ſhip ought to be ſearched; an exception, that fully recognizes the right to ſearch, eſſentially does away the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity intended by the paſſports. But neither of theſe treaties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any regulation relative to the manner of boarding neutral veſſels.</p>
                     <p>This reſearch, though made with care, may have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect; the reſult thereof is, that there are only two, poſſibly three, of theſe eight nations, with whom Great Britain has ever agreed to the ſtipulation, that free ſhips ſhall make free goods; only three of them with whom ſhe has ſtipulated, that full credit ſhall be given to paſſports or ſhips' papers, or with whom the manner of boarding is ſettled. Inſtead, therefore, of that uniformity and univerſality in the ſtipulations in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial treaties, concluded within the laſt 150 years, ſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently aſſerted by Cato, we ſee that in five inſtances out of eight, of treaties concluded between Great Britain and the principal powers of Europe, within that term, they have on each of theſe points, given their ſanction to a law directly in oppoſition to the aſſertion of this adventurous writer.</p>
                     <p>Yet, ſays Cato, "the principles of the ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

It will not be denied that this league, which was aimed prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally againſt Great Britain, failed to accompliſh its purpoſe, and that it expired with the American war. Nothing has been heard of it during the preſent war; and it is notorious, that Ruſſia, and Holland before its conqueſt, were under agreements incompatible with the views of that aſſociation. The northern powers of Europe under the countenance of France, united to ſupport the principles of the armed neutrality; but the league did not include all the neutral powers; and of the powers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the war, at that period, Spain conſented to obſerve the principles contended for by the confederacy, on condition that Great Britain would agree to them, who, ſo far from agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, openly reſiſted them.</p>

                        </gap> been changed, and that the ſtipulations in our other treaties are evidence thereof. The obſervations that have been off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                        </gap> doctrine.</p>
                     <p>The practice of France, of Holland, even ſubſequent to particular ſtipulations, regulating this ſubject between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, has, in reſpect to other powers, been conformable to the law of nations—The ordinances and maritime deciſions of France may be conſulted to ſhow what her practice has been, and that of Holland is evident by the convention of 1689, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her and England. The practice of Spain is underſtood to be the ſame; and in an inſtance that occurred during the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican war, ſhe carried the law to its utmoſt rigour, in aſſigning as a cauſe of condemnation of a neutral Tuſcan ſhip, her forcible reſiſtance of the right of ſearch. Her capture of American
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:028389_0769_0FD8EEF468EDFB48"/>ſhips, during the preſent war, on ſuſpicion of their cargoes being enemy property, affords additional evidence of her prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and opinions on this ſubject. In reſpect to Great Britain, from the general notoriety of the fact, it ſeems, in ſome ſort, unneceſſary to add, that ſhe has immemorially adhered, in her general practice, to the law of nations in its wideſt interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on this ſubject. In a few inſtances, and perhaps for ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial reaſons, as was the caſe in reſpect to the treaty with Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, concluded in 1667, ſhe has entered into oppoſite ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but at this time, unleſs it may be with Portugal, Great Britain has no ſuch treaty with any nation.</p>
                     <p>So undiſputed was the law on this ſubject, and ſo uniform the practice of nations in caſes, not governed by a conventional rule, that congreſs, in the commencement, and through the greater part of our revolution war, authorized our ſhips of war and privateers, to capture enemy property on board neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral ſhips, and our admiralty courts uniformly reſtored neutral property found on board enemy ſhips. This practice continued years after the concluſion of our treaty with France, which contains a ſtipulation, that free ſhips ſhall make free goods, and enemy ſhips enemy goods; no perſon, during that period, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuppoſed that thereby the law was altered in reſpect to other nations.</p>
                     <p>Towards the cloſe of the war, to favor the views of the armed neutrality, in which league the United States were not a party, but whoſe oppoſition to Great Britain they naturally approved; congreſs, in an ordinance on the ſubject of captures, ordained that neutral bottoms ſhould protect enemy goods—but here they ſtopped. Thus far the authority was indubitable, becauſe it was exerciſed only in abridgment of their own rights. Being engaged in war, they could not by their own act, enlarge their rights, or abridge thoſe of neutral ſhips; the extent of both being defined and ſettled by the public law of nations. They, therefore, never authorized the capture and condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of neutral goods found in enemy ſhips, nor could they have authorized the ſame, without a manifeſt violation of the rights of the neutral powers.</p>
                     <p>It is finally alleged that the article, if ſound in its principles, is defective in thoſe proviſions which are requiſite to protect and ſecure the neutral rights of the parties; inaſmuch as it does not contain an explicit ſtipulation for the payment of freight on enemy goods, nor for the payment of damages for the deten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or loſs of neutral ſhips taken without juſt cauſe. I do not recollect to have met with any preciſe ſtipulation on theſe points, in the commercial treaties between other nations.—None ſuch,
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:028389_0770_0FD8EEF5C3C24F90"/>if my recollection be right, are found in any of our other twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and I think it would be ſomewhat difficult to form <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>I RESUME the ſubject of the two laſt papers for the ſake of a few ſupplementary obſervations.</p>
                     <p>The objections to the treaty, for not containing the principle, "that free ſhips make free goods," as being the relinquiſhment of an advantage, which the modern law of nations gives to neutrals, have been fully examined, and, I flatter myſelf, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely refuted.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall, however, add one or two re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>ctions by way of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther illuſtration. A pre-eſtabliſhed rule of the law of nations, can only be changed by their <hi>common conſent.</hi> This conſent may either be expreſt, by treaties, declarations, &amp;c. adopting and promiſing the obſervance of a different rule, or it may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, by a courſe of practice or uſage. The conſent, in either caſe, muſt embrace the great community of civilized nations. If to be inferred from treaties, it muſt be ſhown that they are uniform and univerſal. It can, at leaſt, never be inferred, while the treaties of different nations follow different rules, or the treaties between the ſame nation and others, vary from each other. So alſo as to uſage. It muſt be uniform and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, and, let it be added, it muſt be continued. A uſage adopted by ſome nations, and reſiſted by others, or adopted by all temporarily and then diſcontinued, is inſufficient to aboliſh an old, or ſubſtitute a new rule of the law of nations. It has been demonſtrated, that no conſent of either deſcription has been given to the rule, which is contended for in oppoſition to the treaty.</p>
                     <p>The armed neutrality, ſo much quoted, is entirely deficient in the requiſite characters. Its name imports that it was an armed combination of particular powers. It grew up in the midſt of a war, and is underſtood to have been particularly levelled againſt one of the belligerent parties. It was reſiſted by that power. There were other powers, which did not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede to it. It is a recent tranſaction, and has never acquired the confirmation of continued uſage. What is more, it has been virtually abandoned by ſome of the parties to it—and among
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:028389_0772_0FD8EEFC8E53C538"/>theſe, by the principal promoter of it, the politic and ent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing Catharine. It is, therefore, a perverſion of all juſt ideas, to aſcribe to ſuch a combination the effect of altering a rule of the law of nations.</p>
                     <p>In moſt important queſtions, it is remarkable that the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of the truth are as much at variance with each other as they are with the truth they oppoſe. This was ſtrikingly exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified when the preſent conſtitution of the United States was under deliberation. The oppoſition to it was compoſed of the moſt incongruous materials—the ſame thing is obſervable in relation to the treaty.—And one inſtance of the contrariety applies to the rule cited above.</p>
                     <p>While ſome of the adverſaries of the teeaty complain of the admiſſion of a contrary principle by that inſtrument, as the abandonment of a rule of the preſent law of nations; others, conceding that there is no ſuch rule yet eſtabliſhed, cenſure that admiſſion as a <hi>check</hi> to its <hi>complete</hi> and <hi>formal eſtabliſhment</hi> and as a retrograde ſtep from this deſirable point.</p>
                     <p>The objection in this form is more plauſible than in the other, but it is not leſs deſtitute of ſubſtance. If there has been any retrograde ſtep, it was taken by the government prior <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The reply of our government, is ſeen in a letter from ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> ſecretary of ſtate to that miniſter, of the 24th of July—It <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> in theſe terms—"I believe," ſays Mr. Jefferſon, "It cannot be doubted, but that by the general law of nations, the go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> of a friend, found in the veſſel of an enemy, are free, and the goods of an enemy, found in the veſſel of a friend, are lawful prize. Upon this principle. I preſume, the Britiſh armed veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels have taken the property of French citizens found in ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> veſſels in the caſes above mentioned; and, I confeſs, I ſhould be at a loſs on what principle to reclaim them. It is true that
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:028389_0773_0FD8EEFFC74A5D10"/>ſundry nations, deſirous of avoiding the inconveniencies of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their veſſels ſtopped at ſea, ranſacked, carried into port, and detained under pretence of having enemy goods on board, have, in many inſtances, introduced, by their ſpecial treaties, another principle between them, that enemy bottoms ſhall make enemy goods, and friendly bottoms friendly goods; a principle much leſs embarraſſing to commerce, and equal to all parties in point of gain and loſs; but this is altogether the effect of particular treaty, controuling, in ſpecial caſes, the general principles of the law of nations, and, therefore, taking effect between ſuch nations only as have ſo agreed to controul it."</p>
                     <p>Nothing can be a more explicit or unequivocal abandonment of the rule, that free ſhips make free goods, and <hi>vice verſa,</hi> than is contained in this communication. But this is not all: In the letter, from Mr. Jefferſon to our miniſter in France, of the 26th of Auguſt, 1793, inſtructing him to urge the recall of Mr. Genet, the ſubject is reſumed, the poſition aſſerted in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to Mr. Genet, inſiſted upon anew, and enforced by addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional conſiderations: Among other ſuggeſtions, we find theſe, "We ſuppoſe it to have been long an eſtabliſhed principle of the law of nations, that the goods of a friend are free in an enemy's veſſel, and an enemy's goods lawful prize in the veſſel of a friend. The inconvenience of this principle has induced ſeveral nations latterly to ſtipulate againſt it by treaty, and to ſubſtitute another in its ſtead, that free bottoms ſhall make free goods, and enemy bottoms, enemy goods. We have introduced it into our treaties with France, Holland, and Ruſſia; and French goods, found by the two latter nations in American bottoms, are not made prize of. It is our wiſh to eſtabliſh it with other nations:—But this requires their conſent alſo, is a work of time, and, in the mean while, they have a right to act on the general principle, without giving to us or to France, cauſe of complaint. Nor do I ſee, that France can loſe by it on the whole—For though ſhe loſes her goods, when found in our veſſels, by the nations with whom we have no treaties—yet ſhe gains our goods when found in the veſſels of the ſame and all other nations; and we believe the latter maſs to be greater than the former."</p>
                     <p>Thus, then, ſtood the buſineſs antecedent to the treaty. Great Britain, adhering to the principle of the general and long eſtabliſhed law of nations, captures French property in our veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and leaves free our property in French veſſels. We acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce in this practice, without even a remonſtrance or murmur. The French miniſter complains of it, as contrary to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of neutrality—We reply, that, in our opinion, it is not contrary to thoſe principles—that it is fully warranted by the
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:028389_0774_0FD8EF010577BFF0"/>general law of nations—that treaties, which eſtabliſh a different rule, are merely exceptions to that law, binding only on the contracting parties; that having no treaty of the ſort with Great Britain, we ſhould be at loſs on what ground to diſpute the legitimacy of her practice. We do not ſimply forbear to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe—We do not offer to France as an excuſe for our forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that it is inconvenient to us, at the moment, to aſſert a queſtionable right at the hazard of war—But we tell her pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily, that in our opinion, no ſuch right exiſts, and that the conduct of Great Britain, in the particular caſe, is juſtified by the law of nations—neither do we wrap the motive of our forbearance in ſilence, nor content ourſelves with revealing it confidentially to France alone; but we publiſh it without reſerve to the world, and thus, in the preſence of Great Britain, and of every other nation, make a formal renunciation of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion, that "free ſhips ſhall make free goods, and enemy ſhips enemy goods:" no counter declaration is heard from ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther houſe of congreſs.</p>
                     <p>It was impoſſible to give a more full ſanction to the oppoſite principle than was given by this conduct, and theſe public and poſitive declarations of our government. It was impoſſible more completely to abandon the favorite ground. It is puerile to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to diſcriminate between the force of this ſpecies of renunciation and that of an admiſſion of its propriety by treaty. The conduct of a government avowed and explained, as in motives, by authentic public declarations, may aſſert or renounce a pretenſion as effectually as its compacts—Every nation, with whom we had no contrary ſtipulation, could ſay to us as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> before as ſince the treaty with Great Britain, "your govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has explicitly admitted that free ſhips do not make free goods, and you have no right to complain of our not obſerving that rule towards you." Candour, therefore, would oblige us to ſay that the treaty has left this point where it found it—that it has only not obtained from Great Britain a conceſſion in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to eſtabliſh, but which cannot be claimed as matter of right. Though, therefore, it may not have the merit of ſtrengthening, it has not the demerit of weakening the ground.</p>
                     <p>The difference in our poſition, in this reſpect, before and ſince the treaty, amounts to this, that before the treaty the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment had abandoned the ground through one organ, Mr. Jefferſon; by the treaty, it continued the abandonment through another organ, Mr. Jay—if we conſider the organ as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary cauſe in each caſe, (the preſumption of which is equally fair in both caſes) and if there be any blame, it falls more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:028389_0775_0FD8EF0695C30F68"/>on Mr. Jefferſon than on Mr. Jay; for the former founded and made the retreat, and the latter only did not advance from the diſadvantageous poſt to which he had retreated. In other words, Mr. Jay did only not recover the ground which Mr. Jefferſon had loſt. And we know that, in general, it is a far more difficult taſk to regain than to keep an advantageous po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
                     <p>But, in truth, no blame can juſtly be imputed in either caſe. The law of nations was againſt the rule which it is deſired to introduce. The United States could not have inſiſted upon it as matter of right; and in point of policy it would have been madneſs in them to go to war, to ſupport an innovation upon the pre-eſtabliſhed law. It was not honorable to claim a right, and ſuffer it to be infracted without reſiſtance. It is not for young and weak nations to attempt to enforce novelties or pretenſions of equivocal validity. It is ſtill leſs proper for them to contend, at the hazard of their peace, againſt the clear right of others. The object was truly not of moment enough to riſk much upon it. To uſe a French proverb, <hi>"The play was not worth the candle."</hi> In every view, therefore, it was wiſe to deſert the pretenſion.</p>
                     <p>So alſo, in the midſt of war, like that in which Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was engaged, it were prepoſterous to have expected, that ſhe would have acceded to a new rule, which, under the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of her great maritime ſuperiority, would have ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated ſo much more conveniently to her enemy than to herſelf. And it would have been no leſs abſurd to have made her acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to that rule the <hi>ſine qua non</hi> of an arrangement, otherwiſe expedient. Here again <hi>the play would not have been worth the candle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The importance of the rule has artfully been very much mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, to depreciate proportionably the treaty, for not eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. It is to be remembered, that if ſomething is gained by it, ſomething is alſo given up. It depends on incalculable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, whether, in a particular war, moſt will be loſt or gained. Yet the rule is, upon the whole, a convenient one to neutral powers. But it cannot be pretended that it is of ſo great a value, as that the United States ought to adopt it as a maxim, never to make a treaty of commerce, in which it was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognized. They might by this maxim forego the advantages of regulating their commercial intercourſe in time of peace with ſeveral foreign powers, with whom they have extenſive relations of trade, by fixed and uſeful conventional rules, and ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſubject in time of war to the inconveniencies of not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:028389_0776_0FD8EFE762CEFAF0"/>eſtabliſhed, with thoſe powers, the principle to which they make that ſacrifice.</p>
                     <p>Though, therefore, it be a merit to a certain extent in a treaty to contain this principle, it is not a poſitive fault or blemiſh, that it does not contain it. The want of it is not a good cauſe of objection to a treaty otherwiſe eligible.</p>
                     <p>Let me add, too, in the ſpirit of Mr. Jefferſon's letter, that however it may be our wiſh to eſtabliſh the rule with other nations beſides thoſe with whom we have already done it, this requires their conſent alſo, of courſe their conviction, that it is their intereſt to conſent; and that, conſidering the obſtacles which lie in the way, the attainment of the object muſt be <hi>"a work of time."</hi> It pre-ſuppoſes, in ſome of the principal mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time powers, a great change of ideas, which is not to be looked for very ſuddenly. It was not, therefore, to have been expected of our envoy, that he was to have accompliſhed the point at ſo premature and ſo favorable a juncture.</p>
                     <p>The aſſertion, that he has abandoned it, is made in too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified a manner. For while he admits the operation for the preſent, of the general rule of the law of nations, he has, by the 12th article, engaged Great Britain in a ſtipulation, that the parties will, at the expiration of two years after the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing war, <hi>renew</hi> their <hi>diſcuſſion,</hi> and <hi>endeavour to agree</hi> whether in any, and what caſes neutral veſſels ſhall protect enemy's property. It is true, it will be in the option of Great Britain then, to agree or not: but it is not leſs true that the principle is retained with conſent of Great Britain in a <hi>negociable</hi> ſtate. So far perhaps ſome ground has been retrieved.</p>
                     <p>I confeſs, however, that I entertain much doubt as to the probability of a ſpeedy general eſtabliſhment of the rule, that friendly ſhips ſhall make friendly goods, and enemy ſhips enemy goods. It is a rule againſt which, it is to be feared, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderant maritime power, to whatever nation this character may belong, will be apt to ſtruggle with perſeverance and effect, ſince it would tend to contract materially the means of that power to annoy and diſtreſs her enemies, whoſe inferiority on the ſea would naturally cauſe their commerce, during war, to be carried on in neutral bottoms. This conſideration will account for the reſiſtance of Great Britain to the principle, and for the endeavours of ſome other powers to promote it—and it deſerves notice, that her laſt treaty with France was ſeverely aſſailed by ſome of the chiefs of oppoſition, for containing a ſtipulation in favor of that principle. The motive for conſenting to it, in this inſtance, probably was, that the ſtipulation was likely to be rendered, in a great degree, nugatory by the relative ſituation
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:028389_0777_0FD8BEB01F139CB8"/>of the two nations, which, in almoſt any war in which one of the two was engaged on one ſide, would probably render the other a party on the oppoſite ſide.</p>
                     <p>If theſe conjectures be right, there is a reflection which leſſens much the value of ſtipulations in favor of the rule; that ſo long as one or more of the maritime powers diſavow it, there will be a ſtrong temptation to depart from a ſcrupulous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of ſuch ſtipulations, as we, in relation to France, have experienced in the preſent war.</p>
                     <p>In the courſe of the arguments againſt the 17th article, for virtually admitting the right of ſearch in time of war, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors have had the temerity to cite the opinion of <hi>Vattel,</hi> as being oppoſed to that right; and a mutilated quotation has given an appearance of truth to the aſſertion. It has been heretofore ſhown, by paſſages extracted from his work, that his opinion, ſo far from denying explicitly, ſupports the right to ſearch. But it may be uſeful to examine the part of it which has been tortured into a contrary inference.</p>
                     <p>After affirming the right of ſearch (B. 3. chap. 7, 8. 14) he proceeds thus, "but to avoid inconveniencies, violence, and every other irregularity, the manner of the ſearch is ſettled in the treaties of navigation and commerce. According to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>cuſtom,</hi> credit is to be given to certificates and bills of lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing produced by the maſter of the ſhip." Hence it is alleged the right to ſearch is turned into the right of inſpecting the ſhip's papers, which, being entitled to credit, are to preclude further ſcrutiny.</p>
                     <p>But what immediately follows, deſtroys this concluſion! the words "unleſs any ground appear in them, or there be very good reaſons for ſuſpecting their validity," are ſubjoined to the clauſe juſt quoted. This admits clearly, that the ſhip's papers are not to be concluſive—But that, upon juſt cauſe of ſuſpicion, the papers may be diſregarded, and the right of ſearch may be exerciſed.</p>
                     <p>Who is to be the judge of the credit due to the papers and of the juſt cauſe of ſuſpicion? Manifeſtly the officer of the belligerent party, who viſits the neutral veſſel. Then what does the whole amount to?—Merely this—That ſhip's papers are entitled to a certain degree of reſpect and credit; how much, is left to the diſcretion of the officer of the belligerent party!—who, if he be not ſatisfied of the fairneſs and validity of the papers, may proceed to their verification, by a more ſtrict and particular ſearch, and then if he ſtill ſees, or ſuppoſes he ſees, juſt cauſe of ſuſpicion, he may carry the veſſel into a port of his own country, for judicial inveſtigation—In doing this, he acts at his peril,
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:028389_0778_0FD8EF0A1BCB9DA8"/>and for an abuſe of his diſcretion expoſes himſelf to damages and other puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>This is the true and evident ſenſe of Vattel, and it agrees with the doctrine advocated in theſe papers, and, I will add, with the treaty under examination.</p>
                     <p>The 17th article admits, that the veſſels of each party for <hi>juſt cauſe</hi> of ſuſpicion of having on board enemy's property, or of carrying to the enemy contraband articles, may be cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured or detained, and carried to the neareſt and moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient port of the belligerent party, to the end that enemy's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and contraband articles on board may become lawful prize. But ſo far from countenancing any proceeding without <hi>juſt cauſe</hi> of ſuſpicon, or from exonerating the officer of the belligerent party from a reſponſibility for ſuch proceeding, it leaves the law of nations, in this particular, in full force, and contemplating that ſuch officer ſhall be liable for damages, when he proceeds without <hi>juſt cauſe</hi> of ſuſpicion, provides that all proper meaſures ſhall be taken to prevent delay in deciding the caſes of ſhips or cargoes brought in for adjudication, or in the <hi>payment or recovery of any indemnification adjudged or agreed to be paid to the maſters or owners of ſuch ſhips.</hi> Beſides which, the 19th article ſtipulates, in order that more abundant care may be taken for the ſecurity of the reſpective ſubjects and citizens of the contracting parties, and to prevent their ſuffering injuries by the men of war and privateers of either party, that the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of ſhips of war and privateers, ſhall forbear doing any da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to thoſe of the other party, committing any outrage againſt them; and that if they act to the contrary, <hi>they ſhall be puniſhed,</hi> and ſhall alſo be bound in their perſons and eſtates, <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> make ſatisfaction and reparation for all damages, and the intereſt thereof, of whatever nature the ſaid damages may be.</hi> And further, after eſtabliſhing that the commanders of privateers ſhall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are commiſſioned, give ſecurity to ſatisfy all damages and injuries, it adds, that in all caſes of aggreſſions their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions ſhall be revoked and annulled.</p>
                     <p>Theſe proviſions not only conform to, and corroborate the injunctions of the laws of nations: but they refute the aſſertion, that the treaty is altogether deficient in precautions for guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neutral rights; ſince thoſe above-mentioned are among the moſt efficacious.—It is not preſumable that any ſtipulations have been or can be made which will take away all diſcretion from the marine officers of the belligerent parties; for this would be a total ſurrender of the rights of belligerent to neutral na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſo long as any diſcretion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="203" facs="unknown:028389_0779_0FD8EF0E8A6F91E0"/>and abuſes can only be reſtrained by the penalties that await them. Thoſe ſtipulations of treaties, then, which re-inforce the laws of nations as to the infliction of penalties, are the moſt effectual of the precautions which treaties can adopt for the ſecurity of neutral rights; and in this particular the treaty with Great Britain is to the full as provident as our other treaties. In one point I believe it is more ſo; for it expreſsly ſtipulates a revocation of the commiſſions of the commanders of privateers, for the aggreſſions they may commit.</p>
                     <p>Is not the paſſage laſt cited from Vattel a true commentary on thoſe ſtipulations, for regulating and mitigating the right of ſearch, which are found in our own and other treaties? Do they not all intend to reſerve to the belligerent party a right of judging of the validity and fidelity of the papers to be exhibited, and of extending the ſearch or not, according to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of juſt ſuſpicion which do or do not appear? and if this be their true conſtruction, as it certainly is their conſtruction in practice, which our own experience teſtifies, to what, after all, do they amount, more than without them the laws of nations, as univerſally recognized, of themſelves pronounce? What real ſecurity do they afford more than the treaty with Great Britain affords?</p>
                     <p>It is much to be ſuſpected, that there will always be found advantages eſſentially nominal, operating or not according to the ſtrength or weakneſs of the neutral party; which, if ſtrong, will find abundant foundation in the acknowledged laws of nations on which to reſt the protection of its rights.</p>
                     <p>It has been ſaid to be juſt matter of ſurprize, that theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions ſhould have no place in a treaty with Great Britain, whoſe conduct on the ſeas, ſo particularly ſuggeſted and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced every guard to our rights that could be reaſonably inſiſted on. Obſervations of this kind aſſume conſtantly the ſuppoſition, that we had it in our power to faſhion every proviſion of the treaty exactly to our own taſte, and that the ideas of the other contracting party were to have no influence even upon the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor features of the contract. But this ſuppoſition is abſurd; and a treaty may ſtill be entitled to our approbation, which adjuſts acceptably the great points of intereſt, though in ſome of its details it falls ſhort of our deſires. Nor can any well-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed man ſincerely deny that it was to have been expected, that an adjuſtment of the particulars in queſtion, would fall ſhort of our ideas. It may be anſwered, that we were then at liberty not to make the treaty; ſo we were; but does it follow that it would have been wiſe to ſplit on ſuch points?—upon a juſt eſtimate, their intrinſic value is very moderate.</p>

                     <head>No. XXXII.</head>
                     <p>THE eighteenth article of the treaty, which regulates the ſubject of contraband, has been grievouſly miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented; the objections uſed againſt it with moſt acrimony, are diſingenuous and unfounded! Yet while I make this aſſertion, which, I flatter myſelf, I ſhall be able to prove, I ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to maintain that it is an article completely ſatisfactory. I even admit that it has one unpleaſant ingredient in it, and I am convinced that our envoy muſt have conſented to it with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance.</p>
                     <p>But while candour demands this conceſſion, it equally admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes us, that, under the circumſtances of the moment, the points in this reſpect to be adjuſted were peculiarly unmanage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able —that the poſition of the other party rendered an arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, entirely agreeable to us, impracticable; that without compromiſe nothing could have been regulated; that the article made no change for the worſe in our prior ſituation, but i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> ſome particulars made our ground better; and that eſtimating truly the relative circumſtances of the parties, there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability that any thing more acceptable could have been eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.</p>
                     <p>I will add, that a degree of imperfection, which may fairly be attributed to this article, is far from being of ſuch im<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as, on ſolid calculations, ought to defeat the treaty—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> clear right is abandoned, no material intereſt of the nation injured.</p>
                     <p>It is one thing, whether every part of the treaty be ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory —another, and a very different thing, whether in the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate it be eligible or not, and ought to be accepted or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. Nations could never make contracts with one another, if each were to require that every part of it ſhould be adjuſted by its own ſtandard of right and expediency. The true queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion always is upon the collective merits of the inſtrument; whether, upon the whole, it reaſonably accommodates the opinions and intereſts of the parties. Tried by this teſt, the treaty negociated with Great Britain, fully juſtifies the accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it by the conſtituted authorities of our country, and claims the acquieſcence of every good citizen.</p>
                     <p>The moſt laboured, and, at the ſame time, the moſt falſe of the charges againſt the eighteenth article is, that it allows p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions to be contraband in caſes not heretofore warranted by the laws of nations, and refers to the belligerent party, the deciſion of what thoſe caſes are.—This is the general form of
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:028389_0781_0FD8EF1398041DF8"/>the charge. The draft of a petition to the legiſlature of Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, reduces it to this ſhape. The treaty "<hi>expreſsly</hi> admits, that proviſions are to be held contraband in caſes other than when bound to an inveſted place, and <hi>impliedly</hi> admits, that ſuch caſes exiſt at preſent."</p>
                     <p>The firſt is a palpable untruth, which may be detected by a bare peruſal of the article.—The laſt is an untrue inference, impregnated with the malignant inſinuation that there was a deſign to ſanction the unwarrantable pretenſion of a right to inflict famine on a whole nation.</p>
                     <p>Before we proceed to an analyſis of the article, let us review the prior ſituation of the parties. Great Britain, it is known, had taken and acted upon the ground, that ſhe had a right to ſtop and detain, on payment for them, proviſions belonging to neutrals, going to the dominions of France. For this violent and impolitic meaſure, which the final opinion of mankind will certainly condemn, ſhe found colour, in the ſayings of ſome writers of reputation, on public laws.</p>
                     <p>A paſſage of this kind, from Vattel, has been more than once quoted, in theſe terms, "Commodities, particularly uſed in war, and the importation of which, to an enemy, is prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, are called <hi>contraband</hi> goods. Such are military and naval ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>The United States, with reaſon, diſputed this conſtruction of the law of nations! reſtraining the general propoſitions which appear to favor it, to thoſe caſes in which the chance of reducing by famine was <hi>manifeſted</hi> and <hi>palpable,</hi> ſuch as the caſes of particular places, bona fide, beſieged, blockaded or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted. The government accordingly remonſtrated againſt the proceeding of Great Britain, and made every effort againſt it which prudence, in the then poſture of affairs, would permit. The order for ſeizing proviſions, was, after a time, revoked.</p>
                     <p>In this ſtate our envoy found the buſineſs, pending the very war in which Great Britain had exerciſed the pretenſion, with the ſame adminiſtration which had done it, was it to have been expected that ſhe would, in a treaty with us, even virtually or impliedly have acknowledged the injuſtice or impropriety of the conduct? Here was no eſcape, as in the inſtance of the
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:028389_0782_0FD8EF16110D6AE0"/>order of the 6th of November, 1793, in the miſconceptions of her officers. The queſtion was to condemn a deliberate and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambiguous act of the adminiſtration itſelf. The pride, the reputation, and the intereſt of that adminiſtration forbade it.</p>
                     <p>On our ſide, to admit the pretenſions of Great Britain was ſtill more impoſſible.—We had every inducement of character, right, and intereſt againſt it. What was the natural and only iſſue out of this embarraſſment? Plainly, to leave the point unſettled; to get rid of it; to let it remain ſubſtantially where it was before the treaty. This, I have good ground to believe, was the real underſtanding of the two negociators; and the article has fulfilled that view.</p>
                     <p>After enumerating ſpecifically what articles ſhall be deemed contraband, it proceeds thus, "And whereas the difficulty of <hi>agreeing</hi> on the <hi>preciſe caſes,</hi> in which alone <hi>proviſions</hi> and <hi>other articles,</hi> not generally contraband, may be regarded as ſuch, renders it expedient to provide againſt the inconveniencies and miſunderſtandings which might thence ariſe: It is further agreed, that whenever any ſuch articles, ſo becoming contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band <hi>according to the laws of nations,</hi> ſhall, for that reaſon, be ſeized, the ſame ſhall <hi>not be confiſcated,</hi> but the owners thereof ſhall be <hi>ſpeedily</hi> and <hi>completely indemnified;</hi> and the captors, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> to the neutral party being obviated or leſſened by compenſation there may be the leſs cauſe of temptation to controverſy and rupture—the affair may be the more ſuſceptible of negociation and accommodation. More than this cannot be pretended; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is further agreed, "that whenever any ſuch articles, ſo become contraband, <hi>according to the exiſting laws of nations,</hi> ſhall, for that reaſon, be ſeized, the ſame ſhall not be confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:028389_0783_0FD8EF1826F64610"/>but the owners thereof ſhall be ſpeedily and completely indemnified," &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Thus the <hi>criterion</hi> of the caſes, in which articles, not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally contraband, may, from particular circumſtances, become ſo, is expreſsly the <hi>exiſting law of nations;</hi> in other words, the law of nations at the time the tranſaction happens. When theſe laws pronounce them contraband, they may, for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, be ſeized; when otherwiſe, they may not be ſeized. Each party is as free as the other to decide whether the laws of nations do, in the given caſe, pronounce them contraband or not, and neither is obliged to be governed by the opinion of the other. If one party, on a falſe pretext of being authorized by the laws of nations, makes a ſeizure, the other is at full liberty to conteſt it, to appeal to thoſe laws, and, if it thinks fit, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, even to repriſals and war. This is the expreſs tenor of the proviſion—there is nothing to the contrary; nothing that nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows the ground; nothing that warrants either party in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſeizure, which the laws of nations, independent of the treaty, permits; nothing which obliges either party to ſubmit to one, when it is of opinion the law of nations has been vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by it.</p>
                     <p>But as liberal compenſation is to be made in every caſe of ſeizure, whereof difference of opinion happens, it will become a queſtion of prudence and expediency, whether to be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the compenſation, or to ſeek further redreſs. The proviſion will, in doubtful caſes, render an accommodation of opinion the more eaſy, and, as a circumſtance conducing to the preſervation of peace, is a valuable ingredient in the treaty.

                     <p>A cavil has ariſen on the term <hi>"exiſting,"</hi> as if it had the effect of enabling one of the parties to make a law of nations for the occaſion. But this is a mere cavil.</p>
                     <p>No one nation can make a law of nations; no poſitive regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of one ſtate, or of a partial nomination of ſtates, can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to this character. A law of nations is a law which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, agreement, or uſage has eſtabliſhed between nations; as
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:028389_0784_0FD8EF19203F7670"/>this may vary from one period to another by agreement or uſage, the article very properly uſes the term "exiſting," to denote that law, which at the time the tranſaction may happen, ſhall be then the law of nations. This is a plain and obvious uſe of the term, which nothing but a ſpirit of miſrepreſentation could have perverted to a different meaning.</p>
                     <p>The argument againſt the foregoing conſtruction is in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance this (viz.) it is now a ſettled doctrine of the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that proviſions and other articles, not generally contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, can only become ſo when going to a place beſieged, blockaded, or inveſted—caſes of this kind are fully provided for in a ſubſequent part of the article; the implication therefore is, that ſomething more was intended to be embraced in the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent part.</p>
                     <p>Let us firſt examine the fact, whether all the caſes of that kind are comprehended in the ſubſequent part of the article. I ſay they are not—the remaining clauſe of the article divides itſelf into two parts. The firſt deſcribes the caſe of a veſſel ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a port or place belonging to any enemy, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the ſame is either beſieged, blockaded, or inveſted; and provides, that, in ſuch caſe, the veſſel may be turned away, but not detained, nor her cargo, if not contraband, confiſcated, unleſs after not<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel going to a port or place which is beſieged, blockaded or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted, with notice of its being in that ſtate when ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences her voyage, or previous to her receiving notice from the beſieging, blockading, or inveſting party. This is left to the operation of the general law of nations, except ſo far as it may be affected in reſpect to compenſation by the antecedent clauſe. Thus the fact, which is the foundation of the argument, fails, and with it, of courſe, the argument itſelf.</p>
                     <p>But had this been otherwiſe, the concluſion would ſtill have been erroneous—the two clauſes are entirely independent of each other, and though they might both contemplate the ſame caſes in whole, or in part, they do it with an eye to very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent purpoſes.</p>
                     <p>The object of the firſt is to leſſen the danger of miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, by eſtabliſhing this general rule, that wherever articles, not commonly contraband, become ſo from particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:028389_0785_0FD8EF1A93179A90"/>according to the law of nations, they ſhall ſtill not be confiſcated, but, when ſeized, the owners of them ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnified.</p>
                     <p>The object of the laſt is to regulate ſome ſpecial conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences with regard to veſſels and goods going to, or which had previouſly gone to places beſieged, blockaded, or inveſted; and in reſpect to which the diſpoſitions of the laws of nations may have been deemed doubtful or too rigorous. Thus it is held, that the laws of nations permit the confiſcation of ſhips and goods going to places beſieged, blockaded, or inveſted; but this clauſe decides, that if going without notice, ſo far from being confiſcated, they ſhall not even be detained, but ſhall be permitted to go witherſoever they pleaſe. If they perſiſt after notice, then the contumacy ſhall be puniſhed with confiſcation. In both inſtances the conſequence is entirely different from every thing in the antecedent clauſe.</p>
                     <p>There, there is ſeizure, with compenſation. Here, in one inſtance, ſeizure is forbidden, and permiſſion to go elſewhere is enjoined. In the other inſtances, the offending things are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated, which excludes the idea of compenſation. Again, the laſt part of the laſt clauſe ſtipulates in the caſe, which it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, the reſtoration of the property to its owners, and ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes both ſeizure and compenſation. Hence it is apparent the objects of the two clauſes are entirely foreign to each other, and that no argument nor inference whatever can be drawn from the one to the other.</p>
                     <p>If it be aſked, what other caſes there can be, except thoſe of places beſieged, blockaded, or inveſted? and if none other, what difficulty in defining them? why leave the point ſo vague and indeterminate? One anſwer, which indeed has already been given in ſubſtance, is, that the ſituation of one of the parties prevented an agreement at the time; that not being able to agree, they could not define; and the alternative was to avoid definition—The want of definition only argues want of agreement. It is ſtrange logic to aſſert, that this or that is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, becauſe nothing is defined.</p>
                     <p>Another anſwer is, that even if the parties had been agreed that there were no other caſes than thoſe of beſieged, block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aded, or inveſted places, ſtill there would have remained much room for diſpute about the preciſe caſes, owing to the imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticability of defining what is a beſieged, blockaded, or inveſted place. About this there has been frequent controverſy; and the fact is ſo complicated, puts on ſuch a variety of ſhapes, that no definition can well be deviſed, which will ſuit all. Thence na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in their compacts with each other, frequently do not
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:028389_0786_0FD8EF1DDAEF4F38"/>attempt one; and where the attempt has been made, it has left almoſt as much room for diſpute about the definition as there was about the thing.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, is it impoſſible to conceive other caſes than thoſe mentioned above, in which proviſions and other articles not generally contraband might, on rational grounds, be deemed ſo? What if they were going expreſsly, and with notice, to a beſieging army, whereby it might obtain a ſupply eſſential to the ſucceſs of its operations? Is there no doubt that it would be juſtifiable in ſuch caſe to ſeize them? Can the liberty of trade be ſaid to apply to any inſtance of direct and immediate aid to a military expedition? It would be at leaſt a ſingular effect of the rule, if proviſions could be carried without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption for the ſupply of a Spaniſh army beſieging Gibra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                     <p>The calumniators of the article have not had the candour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>THE courſe thus far purſued in the diſcuſſion of the 18th article, has inverted the order of it, as it ſtands in the treaty. It is compoſed of three clauſes; the two laſt of which have been firſt examined—I thought it adviſeable, in the outſet, to diſpoſe of an objection which has been the principal ſource of clamour.</p>
                     <p>The firſt clauſe of that which remains to be examined, enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merates the articles, which, it is agreed, ſhall be deemed contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of war. Theſe are, "all arms, and implements ſerving for the purpoſe of war, ſuch as cannon, muſquets, mortars, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tards, bombs, grenadoes, carcaſes, ſauciſſes, carriages for can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, muſquet-reſts, bandoliers, gunpowder, match, ſalt-petre, balls, pikes, ſwords, head-pieces, cuiraſſes, halberts, lances, javelins, horſe furniture, holſters, belts, and generally all other implements of war; as alſo timber for ſhip-building, tar or roſin, copper in ſheets, ſails, hemp, and cordage, and generally whatever may ſerve directly to the equipment of veſſels, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought iron and fir planks only excepted."</p>
                     <p>All which articles are declared to be juſt objects of confiſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when attempted to be carried to any enemy of either party.</p>
                     <p>It is well underſtood, that war abridges the liberty of trade of neutral nations; and that it is not lawful for them to ſupply either of two belligerent parties with any article deemed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traband of war; nor may they ſupply any article whatever to a
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:028389_0788_0FD8EF22346F08E0"/>place beſieged, blockaded or inveſted. The former caſe includes a ſpecial catalogue of articles which have an immediate refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to war—The latter extends to all kinds of goods and merchandize. The penalty in both caſes is confiſcation.</p>
                     <p>Theſe poſitions have not been diſputed. The only queſtion which has been or can be raiſed, muſt reſpect the enumeration of the articles which are to be conſidered as contraband.</p>
                     <p>In comparing the enumeration in the preſent treaty, with that of our former treaties, we find the differences to be theſe. Our former treaties include <hi>"horſes,"</hi> and one of them "ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers," which our preſent does not; but our preſent includes "timber for ſhip-building, tar or roſin, copper in ſheets, ſaid, hemp, and cordage, and generally whatever may ſerve directly to the equipment of veſſels, unwrought iron and fir planks only excepted," which are not to be found in our former treaties.</p>
                     <p>It is alleged that the including of theſe articles is an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the liſt of contraband beyond the limit of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> law of nations; in ſupport of which allegation, it is affirmed, that they have been excluded by the uniform tenor of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which have been formed for more than a century paſt.</p>
                     <p>Though this poſition will not, upon careful examination, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear correct; yet it is ſo far founded, as to claim an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, that the article under conſideration has, in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, purſued the <hi>rigor</hi> of the law of nations. It was to this, I alluded, when I obſerved that it contained one unpleaſant ingredient.</p>
                     <p>It is a fact, that far the greater proportion of modern <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties exclude naval ſtores or articles for ſhip-building; yet this is not univerſally the caſe.</p>
                     <p>By the third article of the treaty of alliance and comment between Great Britain and Denmark, in 1670, the parties agree "not to furniſh the enemies of each other with any proviſions of war, as ſoldiers, arms, engines, guns, ſhips or other neceſſaries for the uſe of war, nor to ſuffer the ſame to be furniſhed by their ſubjects." An explanation of this article was made by a convention, dated the 4th of July, 1780, which, after enumerating as contraband, the uſual catalogue of military implements, adds, in the preciſe terms of our arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, "as alſo timber for ſhip-building, tar, roſin, copper i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In a ſeries of treaties between Great Britain and Portugal, down to the year 1703, I do not diſcover that there has ever
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:028389_0789_0FD8EF2389D29278"/>been a regulation of the articles which are to be treated as contraband, between theſe powers.</p>
                     <p>And between Sweden and Great Britain, the 11th article of a treaty, entered into in 1661 (and ſtill in force unaltered, though a ſubſequent commercial treaty was made between theſe powers as late as 1776) ſubjects to confiſcation equally all articles called <hi>contraband,</hi> and <hi>eſpecially money, proviſions, &amp;c.</hi> The ſpecification not being complete, naval ſtores are left upon the open ground of the law of nations; but money and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions are ſuperadded—This latitude would bear little doubt as to the intention to include naval ſtores.<note n="*" place="bottom">An opinion has been propagated that Sweden armed in concert with Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, in order to maintain the neutral right of carrying corn and flour to France, in oppoſition to the convention of March, 1793, between Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Ruſſia; and that, in conſequence of this proceeding, the remonſtrances of theſe powers have proved more ſucceſsful than we have been in obtaining ſatisfaction from Great Britain.
<p>This opinion is throughout, an error, made, uſe of by thoſe whoſe perſevering aim has been, by ſilencing truth, reaſon, and moderation, and inflaming the angry paſſions of the community, to <hi>involve</hi> the country in anarchy and war.—The authors of this impoſture, as well as the exalted patriots who have ſeen in the memorial of our envoy, the humiliation of our country, are referred to a "col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of ſtate papers relative to the war againſt France," publiſhed by Debret, in 1794.

                     <p>It appears from theſe ſpecimens, that there is not a perfect uniformity in the conventions between nations; and that no purely poſitive law of nations can be deduced from that ſource.</p>
                     <p>If we call to our aid the principles of reaſon and natural juſtice, which are the great foundations of the law of nations, we ſhall not diſcover, in this inſtance, <hi>data</hi> as certain as could be wiſhed, for a ſatisfactory concluſion; and the ſoundeſt determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which we can adopt, will be, that beyond a certain point, the queſtion is in a great degree arbitrary, and muſt depend materially upon conventional regulation between nation and
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:028389_0790_0FD8EF2993D535A0"/>nation.—Hence it is there is ſo great a diverſity in the ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of different parties on this point; indicating that there is no abſolute rule. Hence alſo it is, that ſeveral nations, at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent times, being at war, have thought themſelves authorized to regulate and announce, by public declarations, the article which they would conſider and treat as contraband.</p>
                     <p>The opinion of writers will be found to ſupport the article as it ſtands, in the particular, which is now the ſubject of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion.</p>

X. page 80.</note> and he afterwards cites, with approbation, ſeveral edicts or proclamations, which the ſtates general, in different wars with different nations, have publiſhed, declaring thoſe articles contraband—thus referring it to the belligerent party to judge of, and pronounce the caſes when they may right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be deemed ſo—And the ſame idea ſeems to have been adopted by <hi>Grotius</hi>
                        <note n="‡" place="bottom">B. iii. C. 1. V.</note> and ſome other writers on public law—I have not met with one whoſe opinion excludes naval ſtores from the liſt of contraband.</p>
                     <p>Grotius, in diſcuſſing this queſtion, divides goods into three claſſes,

                           </item>
                        </list>
—concerning which he argues in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that the firſt claſs are clearly contraband; that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond claſs are clearly not contraband; and that the third claſs may or may not be ſo, according to the ſtate and circumſtances of the war; alleging, that <hi>if neceſſary to our defence, they may be intercepted,</hi> but upon condition of reſtitution, unleſs there be
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:028389_0791_0FD8EF2996C7C1B0"/>juſt cauſe to the contrary; which juſt cauſe is explained by the examples of ſending them to a beſieged, or blockaded place.</p>
                     <p>The reaſoning about the third claſs has a very inconvenient latitude. It ſubjects the trade of neutral nations too extenſively to the diſcretion of belligerent powers; and yet there is a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous embarraſſment about drawing the true line, one which will duly conciliate the ſafety of the belligerent, with that of the neutral, party.</p>
                     <p>What definition of contraband, conſulting reaſon alone, ſhall we adopt? Shall we ſay, that none but articles peculiar to war ought to receive this denomination? But is even powder <hi>excluſively applicable</hi> to war? Are nitre and ſulphur, its chief ingredients, <hi>peculiar</hi> to war? Are they not all uſeful for other purpoſes; ſome of them in medicine, and other important arts? Shall we ſay, that none but articles prepared and organ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized for war, as their primary object, ought to have that charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? But what ſubſtantial difference can reaſon know, between the ſupply to our enemy of powder, and that of ſulphur and ſalt-petre, the eaſily convertible materials of this miſchievous compound?</p>
                     <p>How would either of theſe definitions, or any other, comport with what thoſe of our treaties which are thought unexception<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, in this particular, have regulated, or with what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the treaties between other nations? Under which of them ſhall we bring horſes and their furniture?</p>
                     <p>If we ſay, that in wars by land, theſe are inſtruments little leſs important than men, and, for that reaſon, ought to be comprehended; it may be aſked in return, what can be more neceſſary in wars by ſea, than the materials of ſhips, and why ſhould they not, for the like reaſons, be equally comprehended?</p>
                     <p>In wars between maritime nations, who transfer its calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties from the land to the ocean, and wage their moſt furious conflicts on that element, whoſe dominions cannot be attacked or defended without a ſuperiority in naval ſtrength, who more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over poſſeſſes diſtant territories, the protection and commercial advantages of which, depend upon the exiſtence and ſupport of navies, it is difficult to maintain, that it is againſt reaſon, or againſt thoſe principles which regulate the deſcription of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traband, to conſider as ſuch the materials which appertain to the conſtruction and equipment of ſhips.</p>
                     <p>It is not a ſufficient objection, that theſe articles are uſeful for other purpoſes, and eſpecially for thoſe of maritime com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce—Horſes are of primary utility in agriculture; and it has been ſeen that there are other articles indiſputably on the
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:028389_0792_0FD8EF2B6969C6B0"/>liſt of contraband, which are entirely within the principle of that objection.</p>
                     <p>Rutherforth, a ſenſible modern writer,<note n="*" place="bottom">Inſtitutes of Natural Law, book II. chap. x. xix.</note> after truly obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, "that the notion of contraband goods is of ſome latitude, ſo that it is not eaſy preciſely to determine what are and what are not of this ſort—that all <hi>warlike ſtores</hi> are certainly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, but that ſtill the queſtion returns, what are to be reckoned warlike ſtores?"—after noticing the diviſion of articles by Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius and the difficulties with regard to the third claſs—draws this concluſion, that "where a war <hi>is carried on by ſea</hi> as well as by land, not only ſhips of war which are already built, but the materials for building or repairing of ſhips, will come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of <hi>warlike ſtores.</hi>" This is a preciſe idea, and, it muſt be confeſſed, on principle, not an irrational one.</p>
                     <p>If we reſort to the opinions which have been entertained and evidenced in our own country, they will be found to have given great extent to the idea of contraband—Congreſs, by an act of May the 3th, 1777, eſtabliſhing the form of commiſſions for privateers, authorize them "to attack, ſubdue, and take all ſhips and other veſſels whatever, carrying ſoldiers, arms, gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, ammunition, <hi>proviſions,</hi> or any other contraband goods, to any of the Britiſh armies or ſhips of war, employed againſt the United States. And in their act of the 27th of November, 1780, acceding, in part, to the rule of the armed neutrality, they declare, that contraband ſhall be thereafter <hi>confined</hi> to the articles contained under this character, in our treaty with France; indicating, by this, their opinion that the liſt of thoſe articles is abridged by that treaty. If the firſt mentioned act was well founded (and there are ſtrong reaſons for it) it eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhes that even proviſions may be contraband, if going directly to invading fleets and armies; which affords an inſtance of their being ſo (analogous to be caſe heretofore put of a beſieging army) in addition, to the caſes of places beſieged, blockaded, or inveſted. And as to naval ſtores, I aſſert a belief, that the common opinion of thoſe perſons in this country, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation had embraced the ſubject, included them in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of contraband.</p>

                  <head type="sub">[CONTINUED FROM PAGE 102.]</head>
                  <p>CAMILLUS, and all thoſe who have preceded him, in conſidering the ſecond article of the treaty, aſſert that it <hi>accompliſhes</hi> a primary object of the envoy's miſſion, and one of great importance to the United States. He then details, at ſome length, the important advantages which muſt reſult from an acquiſition of the weſtern poſts. Although there be nothing new in theſe details, I am glad he has gone into them, as ſuch a view will enable us properly to appreciate the article in queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Camillus ſtates, that a recovery of theſe poſts will extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh a ſource of controverſy between the two countries—will enable us to controul the hoſtilities of certain Indian tribes, which have already coſt four millions—will extend our trade— will prevent Great Britain from contracting our boundaries— and will promote an harmonious and permanent connexion between the weſtern and Atlantic countries.</p>
                  <p>That all theſe benefits would have accrued to the United States from an unconditional ſurrender of theſe poſts, cannot be doubted. I ſay, unconditional, becauſe when we come to the third article, we ſhall find, that as far as an extenſion of trade is concerned, Great Britain has taken care not only to come in for a participation of the fur trade, but that this clauſe is ſo conſtructed, as to ſecure to her, eſpecially when her local ſituation is conſidered, an almoſt excluſive right to this lucrative branch of it. If the ſurrender of theſe poſts will be of ſuch immenſe moment to the United States, and their detention a proportional detriment, how happens it that the acquiſition is not better ſecured than it is? You ſay, it is true, that the object is <hi>"accompliſhed:"</hi> from which expreſſion, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by itſelf, it might be inferred, that a reſtoration had <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> taken place, that being the natural and obvious meaning of the word which is here made uſe of. It is not intended in this place to charge Camillus with an intention to deceive, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe from other parts of this number, the period limited for this purpoſe is aſcertained. But he will allow me to aſk, as has often been done already, why the differences between the two countries could not have been adjuſted in a ſeparate inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:028389_0796_0FD8EF3AD38A8C58"/>and why ſo remote a period is fixed for an evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which might certainly have been made in a much ſhorter time?</p>
                  <p>Great Britain and the United States mutually complained of infractions of the treaty of peace. The former charged as with impeding the recovery of debts; and we, on the other hand, remonſtrated, among other things, againſt her detenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the weſtern poſts. Without reviving here the queſtion of, who was firſt in fault? which would only lead to repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and does not admit of much new light, it may be demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the United States have, by the 6th article, not only admitted the truth of the allegation againſt them, but provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, and actually aſſumed, and pledged their faith for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the principal and intereſt of all the Britiſh debts of this deſcription; why, after ſo ſolemn and entire removal of the ſole ground of complaint, did not our envoy inſiſt upon a more prompt execution of thoſe parts of the treaty which had been violated by Great Britain? It is evident that actual payment was not made by her a condition precedent; for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But when it is conſidered, that this article makes part of a treaty of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, replete with the moſt injurious conceſſions from the United States, ſome of which have undoubtedly been inſiſted upon as conſiderations for it; who will be hardy enough to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiate
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:028389_0797_0FD8EF3C4F0707D8"/>upon advantages which bear no compariſon with the ſacrifices which have been incurred to obtain them? It will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily occur, to every reader, that if America refuſes to ratify a ſingle article, this one which has been excepted as the chef d'oeuvre of our negociator, muſt alſo become a dead letter. Every friend to his country muſt fervently wiſh either that the preſident will have virtue and firmneſs enough to refuſe it his ſanction, or that the king, in a fit of pride, will not conſent to the modification propoſed by the ſenate. That honorable body may yet, without intending it, have promoted the ſalvation of their country.</p>
                  <p>But admitting a ratification to take place, is not every page a fruitful ſource of doubts and altercations? If about ſo plain and ſhort an inſtrument as that which gave us peace, diſputes immediately aroſe between the two countries, and continued without adjuſtment for more than ten years—if the plaineſt expreſſions, and one of the moſt important articles, were quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled into unmeaning and nugatory ſtipulations—if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of Great Britain, although manifeſtly repug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In ſuch an event, the charge that we have <hi>firſt</hi> broken the treaty will be renewed; we may retort it if we pleaſe; but the poſts will be detained until the differences are ſettled, for which purpoſe another embaſſy extraordinary muſt be recurred to; and who can inſure that we ſhall then be able to command the diplomatic ſkill and talents of Governor Jay? Notwithſtanding, therefore, Camillus conſiders this object as accompliſhed, it may fairly be regarded as diſtant as ever, or at leaſt depending on ſuch a variety of intervening incidents, as may probably defeat it altogether. It has frequently been urged, that nothing but a deſire to procraſtinate, and finally to break her engagements, if circumſtances render it prudent, could have induced Great Britain to inſiſt upon ſo unreaſonable a time to perform what good faith demanded of her, the moment we ſatisfied the breach, alleged to have been made by us, and which ſhe could have no intereſt in deferring to a remote day, if ſhe ultimately intended to comply with her promiſe. To garriſon ſo many forts muſt be a great expenſe, to ſay nothing of the troops who might be much more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly employed elſewhere. The views, therefore of the Britiſh
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:028389_0798_0FD8EF3DCB7C8958"/>cabinet in retaining them ſo long, can neither be honorable, nor of the moſt pacific nature. They foreſee, that if any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy ariſes between the two governments, which is almoſt unavoidable, Great Britain will have a pretext for not carrying into effect this ſtipulation. They alſo foreſee, or hope, that peace will, in the mean time, be reſtored to Europe, and that the king will have it in his power to make ſuch uſe of interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing occurrences as circumſtances may render prudent. On the part of America, no propitious event can reaſonably be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. Determined as ſhe is to abide by all her engagements, which ſhe has evinced in every trying ſituation, hers was the preſent moment! It is almoſt paſt; if ſhe neglects, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate individual, to improve it, which has too long been the caſe, years of remorſe and regret muſt follow.</p>
                  <p>If America could have commanded events, a more fortunate coincidence could not have occurred than thoſe which ſucceeded each other, in rapid and aſtoniſhing progreſs, during the whole of her negociation; a more brilliant campaign, than the one on the part of our ally, is not furniſhed in the annals of hiſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="223" facs="unknown:028389_0799_0FD8EF42069DE8A0"/>after all this, can believe that this golden opportunity has been permitted to eſcape, and that the fears of Great Britain have been allowed to ſubſide without our compelling her to do us juſtice? Who can believe that ſhe has had addreſs enough to ſend our envoy home with a treaty which has kindled through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the continent a flame greater than any excited by her former indignities or vexations? Camillus will ſmile, as he always does, at the idea of addreſſing the apprehenſions of Great Britain, or laying hold of her fears to extort from her that redreſs which a ſenſe of juſtice ſhould long ſince have induced her to grant. Philo-Camillus has reſented, in very intemperate language, my calling Camillus an apologiſt of Great Britain. I muſt be excuſed for not retracting an appellation, which is not leſs courted by Camillus, than deprecated by his friend.</p>
                  <p>Does not the 7th number of the Defence furniſh new proofs of the epithet which has been applied to Camillus? Every picture which repreſents the ſituation of Great Britain as criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, is termed by him "exaggerated or falſe." If her armies and thoſe of her allies have been defeated by land, ſhe is, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, <hi>"triumphant on the ocean."</hi> If ſhe owes an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe debt, <hi>"her credit is unimpaired"</hi> and <hi>"her reſources are prodigious."</hi> If ſome diſcontents prevail, <hi>"her government is vigorous, and was never better ſupported."</hi> If her manufactures are injured, <hi>"they are ſtill in a flouriſhing ſituation."</hi> If her commerce is annoyed, <hi>"it is, notwithſtanding, extenſive, and proſperous."</hi> If ſhe is in difficulties or diſtreſs, <hi>"ſhe is ſtill haughty and overbearing."</hi> Truly, ſir! while you thus ring changes on the ſtrength and reſources of Great Britain, who can be blamed for ſuſpecting your motives? Injured as we are, would it not have been a better proof of your amor patriae, if you now and then brought into view, and no one can do it better, ſome of the reſources of your own country? Your lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage conſtantly reminds us of the conduct of the royaliſts at the commencement of the late war. They expatiated, in very ſimilar terms, on the folly, and even madneſs, of oppoſing by force, acts of the Britiſh parliament. They aſſerted, and with too much truth, that we were without men, without arms, without military knowledge, without money, without ſhips, without forts, without credit, and without any of the common means of defence; that our commerce would be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined, our towns reduced to aſhes; and our country laid waſte. America, although the evils which ſhe then complained of were inconſiderable, when compared with the aggravated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults and wrongs ſhe is now ſubmitting to, ſpurned at the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand dangers which awaited her. Diſdaining to ſubmit, ſhe
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:028389_0800_0FD8EF431C9B9FA8"/>riſked all to obtain redreſs. Heaven ſmiled on her god-like efforts, and the bloody and unequal conteſt terminated in free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and independence.</p>
                  <p>It will not be without uſe to take a curſory view, in this place, of ſome, of our reſources, in caſe we are forced into war with a nation whoſe vexations, want of faith and juſtice, will ſcarcely leave us any other alternative. War, at any time, and under any circumſtances, is an evil to be ſeriouſly depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated; but it is a calamity, againſt which no human prudence or foreſight, can, at all times, guard us. It is profitable, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to know our own ſtrength and importance, not that we may become inſolent, and provoke aggreſſions, but that we may reſent, in a dignified manner, thoſe to which we may be expoſed from the injuſtice or pride of other nations. It is not by tamely crouching to inſults and indignities that we can long hope for the invaluable bleſſings of peace; it is by being juſt to others, and compelling others to be juſt to us. We may ſuffer in the conflict; but while our conduct is remembered, our public cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter will command reſpect, and no nation will gladly ſeek occaſions to quarrel with us. The conceſſions we have been in a habit of making to Great Britain, and the returns we have received, have not only debaſed us abroad, but have damped the ardour of our youth, who cannot too early be taught to reſpect their country, and to reſent the injuries ſhe may receive. The puſillanimous language with which our public prints abound, would better ſuit the minions of an arbitrary deſpot, than the citizens of a free and enlightened nation. Patriotiſm and the love of liberty are almoſt extinct, and we muſt not be ſurprized, if the virtuous and heroic deeds of our countrymen who conducted us to the temple of freedom, and gave us a ſeat among the nations of the earth, are ſoon ſtigmatized as the Jacobinical efforts of diſcontented Democrats and Anarchiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s. Theſe are the mild epithets which are conſtantly applied by a certain party, to the beſt patriots among us, for no other reaſon, than becauſe, feeling for the proſtrated honor and violated rights of their country, they urge the government to a more manly expreſſion of their ſentiments, and a more ſpirited vindication of their wrongs.</p>
                  <p>In caſe of war with Great Britain (which is by no means probable, if we act with becoming ſpirit) what are the evils to be apprehended?—Her moſt zealous partizans ridicule the idea of her ever obtaining a footing in this country. At the diſtance of a thouſand leagues, reduced as her army already is, and at war with a great maritime power, it cannot be dreaded that ſhe will be able to tranſport to this country, troops adequate to ſuch
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:028389_0801_0FD8EF44D5CBDD50"/>an attempt. If ſhe had the means, her experience in the laſt war muſt ſatisfy her, that no conqueſt ſhe can attempt will be an equivalent for the enormous expenſe of making and holding it. During the laſt war, although ſhe recruited her armies in this country, although ſhe ſubſidized ſeveral German princes, yet, with all this ſtrength, added to her own, the only perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent acquiſitions ſhe made were a few acres on our ſea coaſts. Many of the diſadvantages with which America then had to contend exiſt no longer. Among theſe may be reckoned, a cruel internal foe, whom, for a long time, we did not dare to puniſh as traitors.

Great Britain, it will alſo be remembered, was then in the zenith of her power, and at peace with all the world, which ſhe had enjoyed without interruption ſince the treaty of Paris, in 1763, a period of more than twelve years.

Ridicule and abuſe are no more teſts of truth, than flowing numbers or fine-turned periods.

                  <p>IT is objected by ſome, who are for enduring every extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, rather than incur the hazards of war, that our trade will be ruined by Britiſh cruiſers, and that the revenue ariſing from it will fail.

Such of theſe nations, as have not had the weakneſs or complaiſance of America, to ſacrifice to Great Britain, the protection which neutral bottoms ſhould over afford, even to enemies' goods, may tranſport our property in ſafety to any part of the globe. It may well be doubted, then, whether our imports will be much leſs in times of war than at preſent, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ven our exports in neutral veſſels, and our own, will be conſiderable. Our merchants often mention, with aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, the number of veſſels, which arrived ſafe during our revolutionary conteſt; when even neutral bottoms could not reach us without the ſame hazard of being captured and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as our own. But the commerce we ſhould carry on, and that of neutral countries, would not be the only ſources of revenue; our privateers would cover the ocean. Does not the commerce of Britain hold out allurements, and afford an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſource of wealth to our enterprizing merchants and mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? The duty on prize goods, added to that on the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of goods in the ordinary way, would not only prevent a diminution of the revenue, but carry it beyond its preſent point. Who would believe, that in the maritime courts of only three of the counties of Maſſachuſetts, namely, of Suffolk, Eſſex, and Middleſex, there were libelled, during the laſt war, no leſs than one thouſand and ninety-five veſſels, with their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes, and thirteen cargoes which had been taken from veſſels abandoned after their capture, making in the whole eleven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and eight! Mr. Coxe, in his View of the United States, aſſures us, that the records of thoſe counties authenticate the fact. He alſo adds, that the number of veſſels belonging to Great Britain, in 1774, as ſtated by a Britiſh premier, in his place in parliament, was, 6219, whereof 3908 were Britiſh built, and 2311 were American built. "What havoc then," exclaims Mr. Coxe, "did theſe fiſhermen make among the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh merchantmen? above a ſixth of all their veſſels, were brought by theſe people as prizes into the markets of the United States, with cargoes to an immenſe amount, compoſed of every ſpecies of military and domeſtic ſupply, in a ſeaſon of the utmoſt emergency: it appears too, that theſe prizes were no leſs than a fourth part of all the Britiſh built ſhips of that nation. The opinion of the moſt candid and beſt-informed eſtimaters, founded on careful enquiry, countenance the preſumption, that fifty-five per cent. of all the veſſels, captured by the people of Maſſachuſetts during the war, were taken before their arrival; ſo that there is the utmoſt probability, that the whole number
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:028389_0804_0FD8EF4D9F17A010"/>of veſſels, which were captured by the ſhipping of theſe three counties, was 2450 ſail. How great a derangement was this to the Britiſh commerce; and how heavy muſt have been the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe of ſalvage paid to the re-captors; how great the number of marine priſoners; how ſerious the interruption to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the navy? "It would appear," ſays Mr. Coxe, "that the armed veſſels of our principal fiſhing ſtate, captured, in the courſe of the late war, near one half of the merchant ſhips, ordinarily belonging to Great Britain, and abo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>A ſtriking proof is exhibited, in what precedes, of the ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous impreſſion made by <hi>our</hi> veſſels on the navigation of Great Britain, at a time too, when it might reaſonably be thought ſhe had nothing to fear from us. The ſource from which this information is drawn, precludes the poſſibility of error. It may be added, that ſuch were the apprehenſions then enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of American privateers, that inſurance of Britiſh mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantmen was more exorbitant than in any war, in which that kingdom had been engaged for fifty years paſt, although no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime nation, with whom ſhe had contended during that period, had been ſo deficient in ſhips of war, as the United States. If America, then, in her very infancy, when ſhe had to contend with a thouſand difficulties, which are now ſurmounted, and can never occur again, was able thus to annoy the greateſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val power in Europe—who can eſtimate the wounds which ſhe may now inflict on her commerce, in the preſent advanced ſtate of her population and ſhipping? She would indeed find us an unprofitable and troubleſome enemy; without the means of retaliation, ſhe would have every thing to apprehend from America. Her trade, as well as that of Spain, Holland, and Portugal, paſſes by our coaſts; and the injury and loſſes to which it would be expoſed, are incalculable.</p>
                  <p>But not in her trade alone, would Great Britain be vulnera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; her colonial poſſeſſions on the continent, muſt fall into our hands. If the gallant Montgomery, at the head of a few hundred men, raiſed in haſte, badly armed, and although brave, mere novices in diſcipline, reduced, in an inclement ſeaſon, the whole province of Canada, except its capital, which, but for his unfortunate and much-lamented death, would alſo have opened its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>? The inhabitants of Vermont alone, which was then but beginning its ſettlement, would more than ſuffice for its conqueſt. I make no account of the diſpoſition of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, who are repreſented as highly incenſed againſt the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh,
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:028389_0805_0FD8EF515FB7B488"/>and anxiouſly waiting a favorable occaſion to ſhake off their yoke, and become part of the United States. Nova Scotia too, and the adjoining ſettlements, would be an eaſy prey to the militia of Maſſachuſetts and the Province of Maine. Theſe important acquiſitions to the United States would more than countervail any loſs they could poſſibly ſuſtain. Nor would any part of the Weſt Indies, in caſe of an American war, long continue colonies of Great Britain. France, with the aid ſhe might derive from this country, could not ſail to reduce them. Her fleets and armies, deſtined for ſuch an expedition, after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruiting in the United States, might proceed, full of health and well-proviſioned for the iſlands.</p>
                  <p>The evils to Great Britain would not ſtop here. Her ſubjects hold great part of the public debt of the United States, and our citizens are indebted to them, to the amount of many millions ſterling. Britain being the aggreſſing nation, and the war not only of her ſeeking, but manifeſtly unjuſt on her part, the principles of ſelf-preſervation would dictate, and her own conduct, and the laws of war juſtify, the ſequeſtration of this property. Mr. Jay, it is true, with more complaiſance to Lord Grenville, than delicacy to his own government, has declared ſuch conduct impolitic and unjuſt. Congreſs, and in particular Mr. Dayton, who moved the meaſure, will not ſoon forget ſo handſome a compliment from a miniſter, whoſe reſpect for the legiſlature of his own country, whatever his private ſentiments might be, ought to have checked this intemperate effuſion. Mr. Jay appears to have thought an excuſe neceſſary for an article, by which we yield much, without gaining any thing; and was, therefore, determined to inſert one even at the expenſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs and the honour of his own country.</p>
                  <p>The tenth article will probably undergo an inveſtigation here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; we proceed, therefore, to enumerate ſome other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes to which an American war might expoſe Great Britain. The injury to her trade, from our privateers, has already been ſtated; but if not a ſingle veſſel of this deſcription was fitted out, ſtill her commerce would ſuffer beyond eſtimation. The interruption of her trade to this country, would be an evil which admits of no alleviation. In the year one thouſand ſeven hundred and ninety one, we took from Great Britain, exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ireland and the Britiſh Eaſt Indies, in Britiſh manufactures, to the immenſe value of very near four millions of pounds ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. It alſo appears, from authentic public documents, that the veſſels of Great Britain, loaded in the United States, in 1791 and 92, were about equal in tonnage to all the Britiſh veſſels, cleared out of that kingdom for Ruſſia, Denmark, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:028389_0806_0FD8EF5481827980"/>Sweden, Pruſſia, Poland, Hamburgh, Bremen, and Germany in general. Will a nation, not infatuated, readily plunge into war with America, and encounter ſo great a loſs as muſt inevitably enſue from a ſtagnation of trade; for the uncertain and precarious advantages to be reaped from ſuch a ſtate of things? If we have no ſecurity in her wiſdom or juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, may we not place ſome reliance on her intereſt, which will be ſo ſenſibly and directly affected by a ceſſation of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe between her and the United States? what will be the clamours of her manufacturers, many of whom are already idle and ſtarving, when ſuch valuable conſumers, as the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans, are compelled, by the injuſtice of their own govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to withdraw their cuſtom? What muſt be the difficulties and diſcontents of the merchants, when all remittances from this country not only ceaſe, but when their debtors here may be rendered unable, in the courſe of the war, to pay any part of their dues, even on the return of peace? What, but an univerſal ſpirit of diſtruſt and diſſatisfaction muſt pervade the whole kingdom, which is now panting for peace, when it is diſcovered, that the miniſter, by his violence and raſhneſs, inſtead of reſtoring to it ſo great a boon, has precipitated it into a new war, which cannot fail to be unpopular, and as long as ſuch extenſive commercial connexions ſubſiſt between the two countries, muſt be execrated in proportion to the ruin and diſtreſs which will ever accompany it? Thoſe who affect to deſpiſe the public opinion of Great Britain, betray an ignorance of the hiſtory of that kingdom. However ſtrong the preſent attachment to their conſtitution—however well ſupported the crown may be—whatever backwardneſs or apprehenſion may be diſcovered at the mention of a revolution, after ſome of the unfortunate exceſſes which have been perpetrated in France, the voice of the people, in much more arbitrary reigns, has made itſelf heard, and miniſters, who have been favorites of the crown, and ſupported with all the patronage and weight of royalty, have been compelled to yield to the imperious, torrent, or have been brought to the block in their attempt to withſtand it.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, from what happened in England in the laſt war, that one with America at preſent will be popular, would be to reaſon from miſtaken premiſes. At that time an act of parliament had declared us in rebellion, and the general accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and belief correſponded with the declaration. The very term carried with it ſomething that enliſts the feelings of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind againſt thoſe, who are branded with the odious epithet. Many wiſe men in England, were in ſentiment with this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, while ſhe confined her object to redreſs of grievance, and
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:028389_0807_0FD8EF55CF9B4510"/>ſought it by petitions and addreſſes; but when ſhe took up arms, and more eſpecially when ſhe declared herſelf independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, views, hoſtile to the mother country, were imputed to her from the beginning, and a meaſure, extorted by dire ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and a ſenſe of ſelf-preſervation, was conſidered, as full evidence of an original and early deſign to ſeparate the colonies from the mother country. Although nothing could be more fallacious, and, in point of fact, more erroneous than ſuch an inference, it had its effect; and either from real abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of its attempt, or from a fear to avow their real ſentiments, the American cauſe, for ſome time, loſt ground in England.</p>
                  <p>At preſent, we are not only an independent people, but have been formally recognized in that character by the king and parliament of Great Britain. The juſtice or injuſtice, as well as the advantages and injuries of the war, would, therefore, become objects of enquiry in England, the reſult of which could not fail to be favorable to the American government and character. It could not eſcape the moſt curſory obſerver, that with a ſincere diſpoſition to cultivate peace, juſtice, and good underſtanding with all mankind, we had been moſt cruelly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted and outraged by the Britiſh cabinet. Correſponding ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents would take place, and the throne and parliament would be environed with petitions for peace; for, even in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, it is yet lawful for the ſubject to convey, in reſpectful language, his complaints to the ſupreme authority of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without incurring the appellation of Jacobin or Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſt. What would be the effect of a war on the public debt of Great Britain, beſides a prodigious accumulation, cannot be aſcertained. Its preſent enormous bulk muſt fill thinking men with ſerious apprehenſions for the conſequences of a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther increaſe. It already exceeds what the moſt intrepid financier would dare to call a public bleſſing. When we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what an enormous ſum was added to it by her attempt to reduce this country to unconditional ſubmiſſion, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe expenſe attending the operations of war, whoſe ſcene is ſo diſtant as America, it would excite no ſurprize, ſhould a national bankruptcy be the conſequence of another ſimilar ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion. Private bankruptcy muſt follow, and public, as well as individual ruin muſt enſue. No man yet has forgotten the numerous failures and private diſtreſs which immediately ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the late rupture with France, the ſhock of which muſt have been inconſiderable, compared with what would happen on a breach with this country.</p>
                  <p>But, ſay thoſe, who are, at all events, for peaceful meaſures, your ſea ports are defenceleſs, and will be laid in aſhes. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grading
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:028389_0808_0FD8EF5A82DB4320"/>as my opinion is of the public conduct of Great Britain, I cannot bring myſelf to believe, that ſhe will pay ſo little regard to the laws of war and humanity, as to conduct it in a way ſo totally repugnant to both. The burning of defenceleſs towns, or even thoſe which are fortified, unleſs in attempts to reduce them, is an imputation ſo horrid, that it can only be made to excite our alarms. It is an evil not to be ſeriouſly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. It is a poſſible, but not a probable danger. Deſolating as the laſt war was, which raged with all the bitterneſs of civil fury, when neither principles, character, nor humanity were reſpected, how few of our towns were conſumed: If then this calamity was but partially experienced during a controverſy, in which a breach of faith and humanity towards rebels, was deemed no ſtain on the national character of Great Britain, why are we to apprehend this mercileſs warfare at preſent? It will neither be the policy nor intereſt of our enemy to conduct it in this way. The ſea ports are emphatically the reſidence of their beſt friends. Deſtroy them, and by whom will the injury be felt? Principally by the advocates, not the enemies of Great Britain; by her apologiſts, not by our friends. Burn the ſea ports, and what becomes of the Britiſh debtors? Set fire to our cities, and America, having loſt all, ſhe will become a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and implacable foe. But has Great Britain no defence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs towns? If juſtice and humanity have loſt their influence on her councils, ſtill motives of intereſt will not be wanting to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain her from ſuch barbarous diſplays of her ſuperiority. Will ſhe not dread retaliation? If America cannot, will not France be able to return the infamous warfare in kind? Will not all Europe applaud a deed provoked by her own cruelties and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs? Let us turn then from the diſguſting apprehenſion, chimerical in the extreme. While France is at war, ſhe can always, and it will be her intereſt to, furniſh a fleet ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the protection of thoſe of our towns which are moſt expoſed. Twelve ſhips of the line and as many frigates, which we ought to have of our own, will more than ſuffice for the purpoſe. Many of them are capable of fortification, and it would be no diſcredit to the government to employ more activity in putting them in a better ſtate of defence. It is become ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, to attribute every effuſion of patriotiſm to the worſt of motives; that it is with ſome reluctance I dare to remind my fellow citizens, of the united voice of America, when ſimilar apprehenſions were excited to deter her from any oppoſition to the claims of the Britiſh parliament. I muſt, however, be ſo conſonant to the feelings of many of the patriots of that day who yet ſurvive, and whoſe principles are not adulterated by
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:028389_0809_0FD8EF5BCF076D68"/>penſions and offices, that I cannot withhold the pleaſure it muſt afford them. "No, ſirs," ſays congreſs, with one voice, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing themſelves to the people of Great Britain, "we never will, while we revere the memory of our gallant and virtuous anceſtors, we never can ſurrender theſe glorious privileges for which they fought, bled, and conquered; admit, that your fleets could deſtroy our towns, and ravage our ſea coaſts; theſe are inconſiderable objects; things of no moment to men, whoſe boſoms glow with the ardour of liberty. We can retire beyond the reach of your navy, and, without any ſenſible diminution of the neceſſaries of life, enjoy a luxury, which, from that period, you will want; <hi>the luxury of being free!</hi>" This was the language of America, when ſhe had infinitely more to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend than at preſent. Whither has the ſpirit, that dictated it, taken its flight? Where is now that public virtue, which not only manifeſted itſelf by thoſe ſolemn expreſſions, which are now ridiculed as the frantic ravings of a diſtempered imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but carried into exerciſe, reſolutions which aſtoniſhed thoſe to whom they were addreſſed, and which, any but men ſtruggling to be free, would have ſhuddered to adopt? What, I repeat, is become of this ſpirit and patriotiſm? Are they laughed to ſcorn? Or do they ceaſe to warm and animate the ſons of Columbia? Heaven forbid! A few years of peace and luxury cannot have enervated their limbs, extinguiſhed their martial fire, or ſtifled, in their generous breaſts, ſentiments which were once eſteemed their ornament and pride. They want but to be rouzed into action. Should a neceſſity exiſt, and the gallant youth of America be ſummoned to their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's ſtandard, may we not indulge the fond hope, that they will pant to entwine their brows with laurels, gathered in the walks of glory and honor, and burn to emulate, if not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, their illuſtrious fathers in heroic efforts, to avenge the public cauſe?</p>

                  <p>IF ever a period exiſted in the hiſtory of any people, in which great prudence and circumſpection were eſſential to the preſervation of public liberty, that period is now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:028389_0810_0FD8EF5D4CE266A0"/>realized in the affairs of this country. To preſerve our conſtitution of government in its preſent limited, and happy form; to guard againſt the encroachments, and the ambitious views of men, with whom the arm of power is entruſted; to prevent the executive magiſtrate from interfering with and exerciſing legiſlative authorities; to maintain inviolate our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional independence, and to give ſtability and energy to thoſe political rights and liberties which are guaranteed by the firſt terms of the ſocial compact; is indeed an arduous, but it is a neceſſary duty; a taſk which requires the moſt intimate union of patriotiſm and talents, of deliberation and caution, with fortitude and firmneſs.</p>
                  <p>Shall we ever remain embarraſſed, as we hitherto have been, by the unhappy diſſentions which ſo long have enliſted us under the dangerous banners of party? Subdued by prejudices, and governed by deluſion, ſhall we ever continue unmindful of the dictates of truth and reaſon? Shall reſentment and paſſion be always ſubſtituted for ſolid argument, and the invidious tongue of calumny be permitted to ſtifle enquiry? If we really, with ſincerity, regard our own rights and liberties, if we are, in truth, attached to the conſtitution of our country, the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be formed to defend them from all invaſion, from whatever quarter the attack may originate.</p>
                  <p>The late treaty with Great Britain has long been tranſmitted to public diſcuſſion; already we perceive the undiſguiſed aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our countrymen to that moſt odious of inſtruments: In vain do we ſearch for its admirers among the ſteady patriots of our country. They are only to be found among the miſſionaries of Britain, and among the advocates of unlimited authority. Theſe, indeed, have attempted to influence your prejudices, in favor of particular men, to excite your apprehenſions, to ſeduce your underſtandings, and betray your judgments, into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the unnatural compact; but all in vain. Truth is omnipotent, and will, eventually, diſcomfit their inſidious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts.</p>
                  <p>Were we not told, and did we not believe, that the ſole ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of negociation was <hi>"a friendly adjuſtment of our complaints?"</hi> was it not officially intimated, that our envoy would <hi>"carry with him a full knowledge of the exiſting temper and ſenſibility of our country, and thus be taught to vindicate our rights with firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?"</hi> Were we apprized, or who of us had reaſon to imagine, that the ſecret views and real intentions of our <hi>cabinet,</hi> was to ſtrengthen the bands of political connexion, between this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and the monarchy of Great Britain? At the moment the property of our induſtrious merchant was wreſted from his

We ſee in that baneful inſtrument, our commercial intereſts abandoned to Britiſh rapacity, our conſtitution vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and its ſecurity ſubmitted to the mercy of future admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations; we perceive a branch of the government attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bind us in particulars to which we had never, either expreſsly, or virtually, given our aſſent, and endeavouring to eſtabliſh, as a conſtitutional principle, its unlimited right to <hi>bind us in all caſes whatſoever.</hi>—With pain we view that branch attempting to draw the peculiar powers of the legiſlature within the vortex of its own authority; to invade the ſovereignty of the conſtituent members of our union; to diſpenſe with the exiſting laws and ſtatutes of our country; to deſtroy the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal ſecurity and liberties of our fellow citizens, and, in time, to diſtort every feature that has either proportion, ſymmetry, or beauty, in our <hi>federal conſtitution.</hi> Such is the operation and nature of the preſent treaty.

                     <p>The period of the negociation was moſt unpropitious to a change for the better—in the midſt of any maritime war, a belligerent nation, enjoying a naval ſuperiority, was like to have been tenacious of a right which ſhe ſuppoſed herſelf to poſſeſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Had it been omitted, the condition of naval ſtores would have been the ſame as with it. But our merchants would th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> have continued to be expoſed to uncertain riſks, which is alway a great inconvenience. It is deſirable, in ſimilar caſes, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>It is in this view to be regretted, that the caſes when provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions may be treated as contraband, could not have been agreed upon; but as this was impracticable, the next beſt thing has been done, by eſtabliſhing the certainty of compenſation in all ſuch caſes. This gives one important ſpecies of ſecurity, obviates one ſource of contention. And if really there may be other caſes than the univerſally admitted ones, in which proviſions can fairly be deemed contraband (as that deſignated by the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="239" facs="unknown:028389_0815_0FD8EF6B440B85C0"/>
But while I confeſs, that the including of naval ſtores, among contraband articles, is an incligible feature of the treaty, I ought to declare, that its conſequences to the intereſts of the United States, as it regards the trade in thoſe articles in time of war, do not appear to me important—War between other nations, when we are at peace, will always increaſe the demand for our bottoms, ſo as to require much additional building of veſſels, and probably in that way to produce a more beneficial ſpecies of employment of the naval ſtores our country affords, than that of their exportation for ſale.</p>
                     <p>The adverſaries of the treaty are eagle-eyed to ſpy out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in which it omits any favourable minutes which are found in our other treaties; but they forget to balance the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count by particulars which diſtinguiſh it favorably from thoſe treaties. Of this nature is the omiſſion of horſes from the liſt of contraband, and ſtill more the ſalutary regulations with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to veſſels and their cargoes going to places beſieged, block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aded, or inveſted. I do not diſcover that theſe uſeful proviſions or their equivalents, are in either of our treaties with France, Holland, or Sweden.</p>
                     <p>It has been ſaid, in reference to this article, "whenever the law of nations has been a topic for conſideration, the reſult of the treaty accommodates Great Britain, in relation to one or both of the republics at war with her, as well as in the abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the rights and intereſts of the United States,"—And the following examples are given, to each of which will be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed a reply.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. "American veſſels, bound to Great Britain, are protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by ſea-papers, againſt French and Dutch ſearches; but when bound to France or Holland, are left expoſed to Britiſh ſearches, without regard to ſhips' papers." The truth of this propoſition depends on another, which is, that the ſea-papers are to be abſolutely concluſive; but reaſons have been given for doubting this conſtruction, which, it has been remarked, does not obtain in practice. And it is certainly a violent one, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it puts it in the power of the neutral, to defeat the rights of the belligerent party, in points of great conſequence to its ſafety.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. "American proviſions, in American veſſels, bound to the enemies of Great Britain, are left by the treaty to the ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure and uſe of Great Britain; but proviſions, whether Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can or not, in American veſſels, cannot be touched by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of Great Britain." The conſtruction of the treaty, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which this difference is ſuppoſed, has been demonſtrated to be erroneous.—The difference, therefore, does not exiſt.</p>

III. "Britiſh property, in American veſſels, is not ſubject to French or Dutch confiſcation.—French or Dutch property in American veſſels, is ſubject to Britiſh confiſcation." This was the caſe before the treaty, which makes no alteration in the matter.—Moreover, it is counterbalanced by this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;— That American property, in Britiſh veſſels, is ſubject to confiſcation by France or Holland; but American property, in French or Dutch veſſels, is not ſubject to confiſcation by Great Britain.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. "Articles of ſhip-building, bound to the enemies of Great Britain for the equipment of veſſels of trade only, are contraband.—Bound to Great Britain, for the equipment of veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of war, are not contraband." This, alſo, was the caſe before the treaty, which, conſequently, has not in this particular more than the former, produced any benefit to one party, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the other. I forbear to dwell upon the article of horſes, as falling under a contrary diſcrimination;—nor ſhall I inſiſt on the additional circumſtance, that all American goods not generally contraband, if going to a place beſieged, blocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or inveſted by French or Dutch forces, are liable to confi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The firſt paragraph of the nineteenth article, in order to prevent injuries by men of war, or privateers, enjoins (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore noticed) all commanders of ſhips of war and privateers, and all other citizens or ſubjects, of either party, to forbear doing any damage to thoſe of the other, or from committing any outrage againſt them: and decleres, that if they act to the contrary, they ſhall be puniſhable, and moreover bound in their perſons and eſtates to make full ſatisfaction and reparation for all damages, of whatſoever nature the ſame may be.</p>
                     <p>Theſe prohibitions are conformable with the laws of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The open and explicit views of the parties, and their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual engagement to put this law in execution againſt all offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, will be a ſalutary check upon the too frequent irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that occur in the courſe of war between maritime nations. The paragraph is a copy of a ſimilar one contained in the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth article of the commercial treaty between France and Great Britain, concluded in 1786, and agrees with the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth article of our treaty with Holland. In order to guard ſtill more effectually againſt the injuries to which the citizens and ſubjects may be expoſed from the private ſhips of war of each other, the next paragraph ſtipulates, that all commanders of privateers, before they receive their commiſſions, ſhall be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to give ſecurity, by at leaſt two reſponſible ſureties, who have no intereſt in the privateer, in the ſum of fifteen hundred pounds ſterling, or ſix thouſand ſix hundred and ſixty-ſix dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; or, if the privateer is manned with more than one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty men, in the ſum of three thouſand pounds ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or thirteen thouſand three hundred and thirty-three dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, to ſatisfy all damages and injuries committed by ſuch pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateers, her officers, or any of her men, againſt the tenor of the treaty, or the laws and inſtructions for the regulation of their conduct; and in caſe of aggreſſion, the commiſſion of ſuch privateer ſhall be re-called and made void.</p>

This particular regulation has been frequently introduced in modern treaties, and exiſts in this preciſe ſhape in the laſt trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of commerce beeween France and Great Britain; I have found no inſtance where a larger ſum has been mentioned. It has, with little conſideration, been made an objection to this regulation, that the amount of the bonds are not adequate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                        </gap> bonds are not required for the excluſive purpoſe of being th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>trained by either moral or political ties, and for whoſe good behaviour, reſponſible and diſintereſted men would not become bondſmen. The ſame principle is developed in the civil adminiſtration of every nation. In caſes of pecuniary truſt, it is a common and uſeful precaution, to require ſurety for the faithful diſcharge of the office; and the principal advantage of this regulation is to ſecure the employment of virtuous and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right officers. The amount of the bonds required on theſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions is ſufficient for this purpoſe, though inferior to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty confided to them.</p>
                     <p>Thus the treaſurer of the United States, who has the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tody of millions, gives bonds for only one hundred and fifty thouſand dollars, the collectors of New York and Philadelphia for fifty and ſixty thouſand dollars; ſums very far ſhort of the public money of which they are in the receipt, yet ſufficient to ſecure the public againſt characters of doubtful integrity. The adequacy of the ſums, in the particular caſe, is moreover <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced by the law and practice of our own country. In the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of congreſs, of the third of April 1776, which, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="243" facs="unknown:028389_0819_0FD8EF733B636A38"/>belonging to the citizens or ſubjects of the parties, is purſuant to that reaſonable courſe of proceeding, which ought always in this and ſimilar caſes to prevail.</p>
                     <p>The twentieth article, which is in prevention of piracy, has the ſanction of numerous precedents. A pirate is the common enemy of all mankind.—All, therefore, ſhould unite in refuſing him aſſiſtance and refuge, and in the eſtabliſhment of ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations relative to the ſale of his plunder, as, by ſhutting againſt him every market, may thereby annihilate the motives to his piracy.</p>
                     <p>The twenty-firſt article ſtipulates, that the citizens and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the parties, ſhall do no acts of hoſtility or violence againſt each other, nor accept commiſſions or inſtructions ſo to act from any foreign ſtate being an enemy to the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.—That the enemies of either nation ſhall not be allowed to invite, or endeavour to enliſt, in their military ſervice, any of the citizens or ſubjects of the other; and the laws, prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch offences, are to be punctually executed. The article farther ſtipulates, if any citizen or ſubject of either party, who has accepted of a foreign commiſſion to arm a privateer againſt the other, it ſhall be lawful for the ſaid party to treat and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the ſaid citizen or ſubject, <hi>having ſuch commiſſion,</hi> as a pirate.</p>
                     <p>The general tenor of this article is in comformity with the ſpirit of our preceding laws on this ſubject; it is moreover in perfect uniſon with the duties of neutrality; thoſe duties which a juſt regard to the principles of integrity, as well as our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened purſuit of our own intereſt, require us faithfully to perform.</p>
                     <p>Two objections have been offered againſt this article; one, that it precludes ſuch of our citizens as, with a view of acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing military knowledge, would otherwiſe engage volunteers in foreign ſervice—the other, that it makes every citizen and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, of either party, who has accepted a foreign commiſſion to arm a privateer againſt the other, and who ſhall be taken in poſſeſſion of ſuch commiſſion, liable to be puniſhed as a pirate.</p>
                     <p>In reſpect to the firſt objection, if, by a rigorous conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the caſe is included within the prohibition, it ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, that it is applicable only to ſuch engagements as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence and are made in time of mutual war. If we have citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, who, with the view of military education, are inclined to engage in foreign ſervice, though from paſt experience there is not much reaſon to conclude that the examples would be nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, they have full ſcope, as I underſtand the article, in the periods of peace, to enter into any of the regular armies of
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:028389_0820_0FD8EF77583F0FD0"/>Europe, that they may prefer; and being thus engaged, they are free to make the campaigns of war againſt Great Britain, if that is their paſſion, without injuring this article. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition ſeems to be againſt engaging in the military ſervice of a nation, previouſly in the condition of <hi>"enemy"</hi> to one of the parties.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond objection has even leſs plauſibility than the firſt; the diſingenuous means that have been uſed to excite a rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of this clauſe of the article, manifeſt the want of truth and patriotiſm of thoſe who have employed them: paſſion and the ſpirit of oppoſition have aſſerted, that the proviſion before us is ſo extenſive as to place the ſubordinate officers and private men, on board of a privateer, within the predicament of her commander; nay, that all perſons, citizens, or ſubjects, of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nation, who would accept commiſſions, or enter, in any capacity, in a foreign army or navy, would, in conſequence of this ſtipulation, be liable to be treated and puniſhed as pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates. It is ſufficient, after noticing theſe attempts to impoſe upon the public, to obſerve that the ſtipulation <hi>expreſsly</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines the puniſhment, in queſtion, to the commanders of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateers, who, contrary to the laws of the land, and the clear and equitable obligations of the members of a neutral nation, ſhall be taken with ſuch commiſſion; and that it does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the under officers or crew, much leſs to ſuch perſons, as contrary to the preceding inhibition of the article, ſhould accept commiſſions in a foreign army or navy. In reſpect to ſuch miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanors in all caſes (except that of equipping and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a privateer, which will expoſe the commander, when taken, to be puniſhed as a pirate) the offence is cognizable only by the nation within whoſe juriſdiction the offence is committed, or of which the offender is a citizen, or ſubject; and, by our laws, is puniſhable only by fine and impriſonment.</p>
                     <p>A perverſion of the ſenſe of the clauſe, ſtipulating, that "the law againſt all ſuch offences and aggreſſions ſhall be punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually executed," has been attempted, though nothing can be be more innocent or unexceptionable. Its plain meaning is, that each party, in the caſes falling within its juriſdiction, ſhall faithfully put in execution its own laws againſt the offences and aggreſſions, in contravention of the article. A ſtipulation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the governments, to execute laws on a certain ſubject, can mean nothing elſe than that each ſhall execute its own laws on that ſubject, in the caſes appertaining to its juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Though moſt of the objections preferred againſt the treaty are marked with that illiberal ſpirit which characterizes the
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:028389_0821_0FD8EF79CECD7978"/>party who have unceaſingly laboured to bring into diſcredit the government of the country, yet few of them have been leſs veiled than this which condemns a ſtipulation intended to curb and reſtrain the few diſſolute and daring characters, who, from the leaſt worthy of all motives that lead to military enterprize, might otherwiſe engage in this piratical warfare.</p>
                     <p>What virtuous citizen would feel himſelf juſtified in accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch command? What muſt be the morals of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructors, who contend for a freedom to commit, what human<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and honor forbid? Every treaty that we have concluded with other nations, is enriched with this ſtipulation; not only our own treaties but thoſe between other nations contain it. How is it that we no where diſcover a trace of diſapprobation, either on the part of our ſtateſmen, or from an enlightened people, againſt a ſeries of treaties, formed by different public miniſters, and ratified by a ſucceſſion of congreſs, each of which contains a proviſion that the crime of accepting a foreign commiſſion to arm and command a privateer, againſt a nation with whom we are at peace, ſhall be treated and puniſhed as piracy? Is it that our virtue has become leſs ſevere? our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality more indulgent? or is it that our predeceſſors were leſs vigilant in defending the rights of the citizens, than the oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatious patriots of the preſent day? But it is time to diſmiſs an objection entirely deſtitute of integrity and decency.</p>

Though the law of nations is explicit, that one nation having formed a particular ſtipulation with another, is not capable, by a ſubſequent treaty with a third nation, to do away, or annul its former ſtipulations, but that the elder treaty, in ſuch caſe, remains in full force, notwithſtanding ſuch poſterior and contradictory treaty; yet, in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all cavil on this point, and to maintain a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

It is a ſufficient reply to this, that the clauſe is expreſsly confined to the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth articles; determining nothing as to the other articles of the treaty.

That treaty was in exiſtence and force, at the time of forming our treaty with France, yet France found no difficulty in the inſertion of the ſame ſtipulations in her treaty with us. She could not have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered their inſertion in the treaty with us as a violation of her treaty with Great Britain, otherwiſe good faith would have to ſtrained her—The war that ſoon after took place between
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:028389_0825_0FD8EF8434D07260"/>France and Great Britain, diſſolved the treaty of Utrecht. Our treaty with France remained in force; yet, in the year one thouſand ſeven hundred and eighty-ſix, France and Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain entered into a commercial treaty, the ſixteenth and fortieth articles of which renew the ſtipulations contained in the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth and thirty-ſixth articles of the treaty of Utrecht.</p>
                     <p>If France was free, firſt to form theſe ſtipulations with us, in 1778, notwithſtanding her prior and exiſting treaty with us, we muſt be equally free in a treaty with the ſame, or any other power, to agree to ſimilar ſtipulations. Both were free, and neither violates their former engagements, by aſſenting, as we have done, to theſe ſtipulations in a poſterior treaty.</p>
                     <p>It is further alleged, that theſe articles are injurious to the intereſt of the United States, becauſe they prohibit, in certain caſes, foreign privateers to rendezvous in our ports, and to ſell within our territory, the prizes they may have taken.—If it is deſirable to render out principal ſea ports and cities ſcenes of riot and confuſion, if it is politic to divide our citizens, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing into their minds the hoſtile ſpirit with which the nations at war are animated againſt each other, if we are prepared to ſee the proſtration of public authority, and to behold the laws trampled upon by armed banditti, if we are ready to invite our citizens to abandon their regular and uſeful employments, and to engage, as adventurers, even againſt each other, in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of plunder, then is the objection well-founded, then is the reſtraint pernicious, then is the ſtipulation worthy of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation —But if to eſtabliſh the reverſe of all this, is the effort and aim of every wiſe and prudent government, the ſtipulation in queſtion demands the approbation of all virtuous citizens.</p>
                     <p>But were none of theſe conſequences to be apprehended from the free admiſſion of the privateers of all nations engaged in war, and the permiſſion to ſell their plunder, it would, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, be againſt the intereſts of the United States to allow the ſame. It is a ſound commercial principle, that the intereſt of buyers, as well as ſellers, is beſt promoted by a free competition.—The great number of the ſellers of foreign ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures and productions, afford the beſt market for the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers —The great number of buyers of our productions, afford the beſt market for the ſellers—foreign privateers are precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſellers, and buyers only for their own conſumption—They drive away and baniſh from our markets, both buyers and ſell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. When our coaſts are lined with foreign privateers that rendezvous in our ports, the merchant ſhips of all nations, not excepting our own, will be liable to interruption, and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged from coming to our markets; and theſe of the belligerent
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:028389_0826_0FD8EF84370CE540"/>powers will be generally excluded—Our markets might, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, derive ſupplies from the prizes that ſuch privateers ſhould take, ſo as, in ſome degree, to compenſate for the deficiency that would proceed from the excluſion of foreign merchantmen; but this ſupply would be uncertain, irregular, ill-aſſorted, and partial, while the principal commercial detriment would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>IT is now time to fulfil my promiſe of an examination of the conſtitutionality of the treaty. Of all the objections which have been contrived againſt this inſtrument, thoſe relating to this point are the moſt futile—If there be a political problem capable of complete demonſtration, the conſtitutionality of the treaty, in all its parts, is of this ſort—It is even difficult to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that any man in either houſe of congreſs, who values his reputation for diſcernment or ſincerity, will publicly hazard it by a ſerious attempt to controvert the poſition.</p>
                     <p>It is, nevertheleſs, too much a faſhion with ſome politicians, when hard preſſed on the expediency of a meaſure, to entrench themſelves behind objections to its conſtitutionality—Aware that there is naturally in the public mind a jealous ſenſibility to objections of that nature, which may prediſpoſe againſt a thing otherwiſe acceptable, if even a doubt, in this reſpect, can be raiſed—They have been too forward to take advantage of this propenſity, without weighing the real miſchief of the example. For, however it may ſerve a temporary purpoſe, its ultimate tendency is, by accuſtoming the people to obſerve, that alarms of this kind are repeated with levity and without cauſe, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them for diſtruſting the cry of danger, when it may be real: Yet the imprudence has been ſuch, that there has ſcarcely been an important public queſtion, which has not involved more or leſs of this ſpecies of controverſy.</p>
                     <p>In the preſent caſe, the motives of thoſe who may incline to defeat the treaty, are unuſually ſtrong for creating, if poſſible, a doubt concerning its conſtitutionality.</p>
                     <p>The treaty, having been ratified on both ſides, the dilemma plainly is between a violation of the conſtitution, by the treaty, and a violation of the conſtitution, by obſtructing the execution of the treaty.</p>
                     <p>The VIth. article of the conſtitution of the United States, declares, that "the conſtitution and the laws of the United States, made in purſuance thereof, all <hi>treaties made, or which ſhall be made under the authority of the United States,</hi> ſhall <hi>be the ſupreme law of the land,</hi> any thing in the conſtitution or laws of any ſtate to the contrary notwithſtanding." A law of the land, till revoked or annulled, by the competent authority, is binding, not leſs on each branch or department of the government than on each individual of the ſociety—Each houſe of congreſs collectively, as well as the members of it ſeparately, are under a conſtitutional obligation to obſerve the injunctions of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſting
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:028389_0830_0FD8EF8CC4738E90"/>law, and to give it effect.—If they act otherwiſe, they infringe the conſtitution; the theory of which knows, in ſuch caſe, no diſcretion on their part—To reſort to firſt principles for their juſtification, in aſſuming ſuch a diſcretion, is to go out of the conſtitution for an authority, which they cannot find in it—it is to uſurp the original character of the people themſelves—it is, in principle, to proſtrate the government.</p>
                     <p>The caſes muſt be very extraordinary that can excuſe ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent an aſſumption of diſcretion. They muſt be of a kind to authorize a revolution in government;—for every reſort to ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal principles, in derogation from the eſtabliſhed conſtitution, partakes of this character.</p>

It is time to enter on the momentous diſcuſſion. The queſtion ſhall be examined in the four following views—1. In relation to the theory of the conſtitution—2. In relation to the manner in which it was underſtood by the convention who framed it, and by the people who adopted it—3. In relation to the practice upon a ſimilar power in the confederation—4. In relation to the practice under our preſent conſtitution, prior to the treaty with Great Britain—In all theſe views, the conſtitutionality of the treaty can be vindicated beyond the poſſibility of a ſerious doubt.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As to the theory of the conſtitution—The conſtitution of the United States diſtributes its powers into three departments, legiſlative, executive, judiciary.—The firſt article defines the ſtructure, and ſpecifies the various powers, of the legiſlative de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment—The ſecond article eſtabliſhes the organization and powers of the executive department—The third article does the ſame with reſpect to the judiciary department—The fourth and fifth, and ſixth articles, which are the laſt, are a miſcellany of particular proviſions.</p>
                     <p>The firſt article declares that "all <hi>legiſlative power</hi> granted by the conſtitution ſhall be veſted in a congreſs of the United States, which ſhall conſiſt of a ſenate and a houſe of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives."</p>
                     <p>The ſecond article, which organizes and regulates the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive department, declares that the <hi>"executive power</hi> ſhall be veſted in a preſident of the United States of America;" and proceeding to detail particular authorities of the executive, it declares that the "preſident ſhall have power, by and with the advice and conſent of the ſenate, <hi>to make treaties,</hi> provided two-thirds of the ſenators preſent concur." There is in no part of the conſtitution any explanation of this power to make treaties, any definition of its objects, or delineation of its bounds—The only other proviſion in the conſtitution reſpecting it, is in the ſixth article, which provides, as already noticed, that all treaties made or which ſhall be made under the authority of the United States, ſhall be the ſupreme law of the land;—and this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any thing in the conſtitution or laws of any ſtate to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>It was impoſſible for words more comprehenſive to be uſed than thoſe which grant the power to make treaties. They are ſuch as would naturally be employed to confer a <hi>plenipotentiary</hi> authority—A power "to make treaties," granted in theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite terms, extends to all kinds of treaties, and with all the latitude which ſuch a power, under any form of government, can poſſeſs—the power <hi>"to make"</hi> implies a power to act <hi>autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatively</hi>
                        <pb n="256" facs="unknown:028389_0832_0FD8EF9590E1ABA8"/>and <hi>concluſively,</hi> independent of the after-clauſe which expreſsly places treaties among the ſupreme laws of the land. The thing to be made is a treaty.</p>
                     <p>With regard to the objects of the treaty, there being no ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification, there is, of courſe, a <hi>charte blanche.</hi> The general propoſition muſt, therefore, be, that whatever is a proper ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of compact, between nation and nation, may be embraced by a treaty between the preſident of the United States, with the advice and conſent of the ſenate, and the correſpondent organ of a foreign ſtate.</p>
                     <p>The authority being general, it comprizes, of courſe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever cannot be ſhown to be neceſſarily an exception to it.</p>
                     <p>The only conſtitutional exception to the power of making treaties is, that it ſhall not change the conſtitution; which reſults from this fundamental maxim, that a delegated authority cannot alter the conſtituting act, unleſs ſo expreſsly authorized by the conſtituting power. An agent cannot new-model his own commiſſion.—A treaty, for example, cannot transfer the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative power to the executive department, nor the power of this laſt department to the judiciary; in other words, it cannot ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulate that the preſident, and not congreſs, ſhall make laws for the United States, that the judges, and not the preſident, ſhall-command the national forces.</p>
                     <p>Again, there is alſo a <hi>national</hi> exception to the power of making treaties, as there is to every other delegated power, which reſpects abuſes of authority in palpable and extre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>me caſes. On natural principles, a treaty, which ſhould manifeſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap> betray or ſacrifice the private intereſts of the ſtate, would be null. But this preſents a queſtion foreign from that of the modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or diſtribution of conſtitutional powers. It applies to the caſe of the pernicious exerciſe of a power, where there is legal competency. Thus the power of treaty, though extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the right of making alliances offenſive and defenſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>, might not be exerciſed in making an alliance, ſo injurious to the ſtate as to juſtify the non-obſervance of the contract.</p>
                     <p>Beyond theſe exceptions to the power, none occurs that can be ſupported.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe which have been inſiſted upon, towards invalidating the treaty with Great Britain, are not even plauſible. They amount to this, that a treaty can eſtabliſh nothing between the United States and a foreign nation, which it is the province of the legiſlative authority to regulate in reference to the United States alone. It cannot, for inſtance, eſtabliſh a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular rule of commercial intercourſe between the United States and Great Britain; becauſe it is provided in the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:028389_0833_0FD8EF994A49A6D8"/>that congreſs <hi>"ſhall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations."</hi> This is equivalent to affirming that all the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects upon which the legiſlative power may act, in relation to our country, are excepted out of the power to make treaties.</p>
                     <p>Two obvious conſiderations refu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e this doctrine. One, that the power to make treaties, and the power to make laws, are different things, operating by different means, upon different ſubjects; the other, that the conſtruction reſulting from ſuch a doctrine would defeat the power to make treaties, while its oppoſite reconciles this power with the power of making laws.</p>
                     <p>The power to make laws is, "the power of pronouncing authoritatively the will of the nation as to all perſons and things over which it has juriſdiction:" or it may be defined to be "the power of preſcribing rules binding upon all perſons and things over which the nation has juriſdiction." It acts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſively upon all perſons, whether foreigners or citizens, and upon all things within the territory of ſuch nation, and alſo upon its own citizens and their property without its territory in certain caſes and under certain limitations. But it can have no obligatory action whatſoever upon a foreign nation or upon any perſon or thing within the juriſdiction of a foreign na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>The power of treaty, on the other hand, is the power by <hi>agreement, convention,</hi> or <hi>compact,</hi> to eſtabliſh rules binding upon two or more nations, their reſpective citizens and property. The rule eſtabliſhed derives its reciprocal obligation from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, from the faith which the contracting parties pledge to each other—not from the power of either to preſcribe a rule for the other. It is not here the will of a <hi>ſuperior</hi> that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; it is the conſent of two independent parties that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>means</hi> which the power of legiſlation employs, are <hi>laws</hi> which it enacts, or rules which it enjoins; the <hi>ſubject</hi> upon which it acts is the nation of whom it is, the perſons and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty within the juriſdiction of the nation. The <hi>means,</hi> which the power of treaty employs, are <hi>contracts</hi> with other nations, who may or may not enter into them—The <hi>ſubjects</hi> upon which it acts are the nations contracting and thoſe perſons and things of each to which the contract relates—Though a treaty may effect what a law can, yet a law cannot effect what a treaty does. Theſe diſcriminations are obvious and deciſive; and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the operation of a treaty may, in ſome things, reſemble that of a law, no two ideas are more diſtinct, than that of <hi>legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating</hi> and that of <hi>contra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>

It follows that there is no ground for the inference pretended to be drawn, that the legiſlative powers of congreſs are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted out of the power of making treaties. It is the province of the latter to do what the former cannot do—Congreſs (to purſue ſtill the caſe of regulating trade) may regulate by law, our own trade and that which foreigners come to carry on with us; but they cannot regulate the trade which we may go to carry on <hi>in foreign</hi> countries; they can give to us no rights, no privileges there. This muſt depend on the will and regulations of thoſe countries; and, conſequently, it is the province of the power of treaty to eſtabliſh the rules of commercial intercourſe <hi>between</hi> foreign nations and the United States. The legiſlative may regulate our own trade, but treaty only can regulate the national trade between our own and another country.</p>
                     <p>The conſtitution accordingly conſiders the power of treaty as different from that of legiſlation. This is proved in two ways, I. That while the conſtitution declares that all the <hi>legiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> powers which it grants ſhall be veſted in congreſs, it veſts the power of making treaties in <hi>the preſident</hi> with conſent of the ſenate. II. That the ſame article by which it is declared that the <hi>executive</hi> power ſhall be veſted in a preſident, and in which ſundry executive powers are detailed, gives the power to ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> treaties to the preſident, with the auxiliary agency of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. Thus the power of making treaties is placed in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Laws are the acts of legiſlation of a particular nation for itſelf. Treaties are the acts of the legiſlation of ſeveral nations for themſelves jointly and reciprocally. The legiſlative powers of one ſtate cannot reach the caſes which depend on the joint legiſlation of two or more ſtates. For this, reſort muſt be had to the <hi>pactitious</hi> power, or the power of treaty—This is another attitude of the ſubject, diſplaying the fallacy of the propoſition, that the legiſlative powers of congreſs, are exceptions to, or limitations of, the power of the preſident, with the aid of the ſenate, to make treaties.</p>

It muſt have been obſerved that the argument in the laſt number is applicable to all the legiſlative powers of congreſs, as well as to that of regulating trade, which was ſelected, by way of illuſtration, on the ground of its being common to all—Indeed the inſtance of the regulations of trade is that which is moſt favorable to the oppoſite doctrine—Since foreign na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are named in the clauſe; the true intent of which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, has been explained.</p>
                     <p>The ſame reaſoning, too, would extend the power of treaties to thoſe objects which are conſigned to the legiſlation of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual ſtates; but here the conſtitution has announced its mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in expreſs terms, by declaring, that the treaties which have been and ſhall be made under the authority of the United States, ſhall be the ſupreme law of the land, any thing in the conſtitution or laws of any ſtate to the contrary notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—This manifeſtly recognizes the ſupremacy of the power of treaties over the laws of particular ſtates, and goes even a ſtep farther.</p>
                     <p>The obvious reaſon for this ſpecial proviſion, in regard to the laws of individual ſtates, is, that there might otherwiſe have been room for queſtion—whether a treaty of the union could embrace objects, the internal regulation of which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the ſeparate authorities of the ſtates. But with regard to the United States there was no room for a ſimilar queſtion.</p>
                     <p>The power of treaty could not but be ſuppoſed commenſurate with all theſe objects to which the legiſlative power of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on extended, which are the proper ſubjects of compacts with foreign nations.</p>
                     <p>It is a queſtion among ſome theoretical writers—whether a treaty can repeal <hi>pre-exiſting laws?</hi> This queſtion muſt always be anſwered by the particular form of government of each na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In our conſtitution, which gives, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> the force of law, to treaties, making them equal with the acts of congreſs, the ſupreme law of the land, a treaty muſt neceſſarily repeal an antecedent law contrary to it; according to the legal maxim that <hi>"leges poſteriores priores contrarias abrogant."</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But even in thoſe forms of government, in which there may be room for ſuch a queſtion, it is not underſtood that a treaty containing ſtipulations which require the repeal of antecedent laws, is, on that account, unconſtitutional and null. The true meaning is, that the antecedent laws are not, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by the treaty—But the legiſlature is, nevertheleſs, bound in good faith, under the general limitation, ſtated in another place, to lend its authority to remove obſtacles which previous laws might oppoſe to a fair execution of a treaty.</p>

One inſtance of the inconſiſtency, prevailing in the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt the treaty, negociated by Mr. Jay, is obſervable in this point. To get rid of the infractions of our treaty of peace with Great Britain by certain laws of particular ſtates, it is ſtre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>uouſly maintained that treaties controul the laws of ſtates. To impeach the conſtitutionality of the treaty under conſideration, it is objected, that, in ſome points, it interferes with the objects of ſtate legiſlation. The expreſs proviſion of the conſtitution in this particular, quoted above, has not been ſufficient to check the rage for objection.</p>
                     <p>The abſurdity of the alleged interferences will fully appear, by ſhowing how they would operate upon the ſeveral kinds of treaties uſual among nations. Theſe may be claſſed under three principal heads.

                        </gap>lly excluded, and this on two grounds—1. Becauſe it is their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate object to decline a caſe or caſes in which one nation ſhall take part with another in war, contrary, in the ſenſe of the objection, to that clauſe of the conſtitution which gives to congreſs the power of declaring war; and 2. Becauſe the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours ſtipulated, in whatever ſhape they may be, muſt involve an expenditure of money—not to ſay, that it is common to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulate ſuccours in money, either in the firſt inſtance or by way of alternative. It will be pertinent to obſerve incidentally, in this place, that even the humane and laudable proviſion in the ſeventeenth article, which all have approved, is within the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the objection; for the effect of this is to reſtrain the power and diſcretion of congreſs to grant repriſals, till there has been an unſucceſsful demand of juſtice. Nothing can bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter illuſtrate the unreaſonable tendency of the principle.</p>
                     <p>Treaties of peace are alſo excluded, or, at the leaſt, are ſo narrowed as to be in the greateſt number of caſes impracticable —The moſt common conditions of theſe treaties are reſtitutions or ceſſions of territory, on one ſide or on the other, frequently on both ſides, regulations of boundary—reſtitutions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations of property—pecuniary indemnifications for inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries or expenſes—It will, probably, not be eaſy to find a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent of a treaty of peace, which does not contain one or more of theſe proviſions, as the baſis of the ceſſation of hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:028389_0839_0FD8EFABE629DDF0"/>and they are all them naturally to be looked for in an agreement which is to put an end to the ſtate of war between conflicting nations.</p>
                     <p>Yet they are all precluded by the objections which have been enumerated: pecuniary indemnifications, by that which reſpects the appropriations of money; reſtitutions or ceſſions of terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory or property, regulations of boundary, by that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the right of congreſs to diſpoſe of, and make all needful rules and regulations concerning the territory and property of the United States—It is to be obſerved, likewiſe, that ceſſions of territory are almoſt always accompanied with ſtipulations in favor of thoſe, who inhabit the ceded territory, ſecuring per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal privileges and private rights of property; neither of which could be acceded to on the principles of that objection, which relates to the power of naturalization; for this power has reference to two ſpecies of rights, thoſe of privilege and thoſe of prope<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>y. And act allowing a foreigner to hold real eſtate is ſo far an act of naturalization; ſince it is one of the conſequences of alieniſm, not to be able to hold real eſtate.</p>
                     <p>It follows, that if the objections which are taken to the treaty, on the point of conſtitutionality, are valid, the preſident, with the advice and conſent of the ſenate, can make neither a treaty of commerce nor alliance, and rarely, if at all, a treaty of peace. It is probable, that on a minute analyſis, there is ſcarcely any ſpecies of treaty which would not claſh, in ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, with the principle of thoſe objections; and thus, as was before obſerved, the power to make treaties, granted in ſuch comprehenſive and indefinite terms, and guarded with ſo much precaution, would become eſſentially nugatory.</p>
                     <p>This is ſo obviouſly againſt the principles of ſound conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it, at the ſame time, expoſes the government to ſo much impotence in one great branch of political power, in oppoſition to a main intent of the conſtitution—and it tends ſo directly to fruſtrate one principal object of the ſituation of a general government, the convenient management of our external con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, that it cannot but be rejected by every diſcerning man who will examine and pronounce with ſincerity. It is againſt the principles of ſound conſtruction; becauſe theſe teach us, that every inſtrument is ſo to be interpreted, as that all the parts may, if poſſible, conſiſt with each other, and have their effect. But the conſtruction which is combated would cauſe the legiſlative power to deſtroy the power of making treaties. Moreover, if the power of the executive department be inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to the making of the ſeveral kinds of treaties, which have been mentioned, there is, then, no power in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:028389_0840_0FD8EFACD511AD40"/>to make them; for there is not a ſyllable in the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which authorizes either the legiſlative or judiciary depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to make a treaty with a foreign nation. And our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution would then exhibit the ridiculous ſpectacle of a government without a power to make treaties with foreign na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: a reſult as inadmiſſable as it is abſurd; ſince, in fact, our conſtitution grants the power of making treaties, in the moſt explicit and ample terms, to the preſident, with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and conſent of the ſenate. On the contrary, all difficulty is avoided, by diſtinguiſhing the province of the two powers, according to ideas which have been always familiar to us, and which were never expoſed to any queſtion till the treaty with Great Britain gave exerciſe to the ſubtilties of party ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>By confining the power to make laws within its proper ſphere, and reſtricting its actions to the eſtabliſhment of rules for our own nation and thoſe foreigners who come within our juriſdiction—and by aſſigning to the power of treaty the office of concerting thoſe rules of mutual intercourſe and connexion, between us and foreign nations, which require their conſent as well as our own; allowing to it the latitude neceſſary for this purpoſe, a harmonious agreement is preſerved between the different powers of the government: that to make laws, and that to make treaties; between the authority of the legiſlative and the authority of the executive department—Hence,</p>
                     <p>Though congreſs, by the conſtitution, have power to lay taxes, yet a treaty may reſtrain the exerciſe of it in particular caſes. For a nation, like an individual, may abridge its moral power of action by agreement; and the organ charged with the legiſlative power of a nation may be reſtrained in its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration by the agreements of the organ of its <hi>federative</hi> power, or power to contract: let it be remembered, that the nation is the <hi>conſtituent,</hi> and that the executive, within its ſphere, is no leſs the organ of its will than the legiſlature.</p>
                     <p>Though congreſs are empowered to make regulations of trade, yet they are not excluſively ſo empowered—But regulations of trade may alſo be made by treaty; and, where other nations are to be bound by them, muſt be made by treaty.</p>
                     <p>Though congreſs are authorized to eſtabliſh a uniform rule of naturalization, yet this contemplates only the ordinary caſes of internal adminiſtration, in particular and extraordinary caſes, thoſe in which the pretenſions of a foreign government are to be managed—a treaty may alſo confer the rights and privileges of citizens; thus the abſolute ceſſion and plenary dominion of a province or diſtrict, poſſeſſed by our arms in war, may be
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:028389_0841_0FD8EFAE4A0E7298"/>accepted by the treaty of peace, on the condition, that its inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants ſhall, in their perſons and property enjoy the privileges of citizens.</p>
                     <p>The ſame reaſoning applies to all the other inſtances of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed infraction of the legiſlative authority:—with regard to piracies and offences againſt the laws of nations; with regard to expenditures of money, with regard to the appointment of officers, with regard to the judiciary tribunals, with regard to the diſpoſal and regulation of the national territory and property —In all theſe caſes, the power to make laws and the power to make treaties are concurrent and co-ordinate—The latter, and not the former, muſt act, where the co-operation of other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is requiſite.</p>
                     <p>As to what reſpects the commiſſioners agreed to be appointed, they are n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>, in a ſtrict ſenſe, <hi>officers.</hi> They are <hi>arbitrators</hi> between the two countries. Though in the conſtitutions, both of the United States and of moſt of the individual ſtates, a particular mode of appointing officers is deſignated—Yet, in practice, it has not been deemed a violation of the proviſion to appoint commiſſioners or ſpecial agents for ſpecial purpoſes, in a different mode.</p>
                     <p>As to the proviſion, which reſtricts the iſſuing of money from the treaſury, to caſes of appropriation by law, and which, from its intrinſic nature, may be conſidered as applicable to the exerciſe of every power of government, it is, in no ſort, touched by the treaty. In the conſtant practice of the government, the cauſe of an expenditure, or the contract which incurs it, is a different thing from the appropriation for ſatisfying it. Thus the ſalary of a public officer is fixed by one law, the appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for its payment by another. So, the treaty only ſtipulates what may be a cauſe of expenditure. An appropriation by law will ſtill be requiſite for actual payment.</p>
                     <p>As to the diſpoſal and regulation of the territory and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the United States, this will be naturally underſtood of diſpoſitions and regulations purely domeſtic, and where the title is not diſputed by a foreign power. Where there are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering claims of foreign powers, as neither will acknowledge the right of the other to decide, treaty muſt directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly adjuſt the diſpute.</p>
                     <p>So far then it is from being true, that the power of treaty can extend to nothing upon which, in relation to ourſelves, the legiſlative power may act—that it may rather be laid down as a general rule, that a treaty may do between different nations whatever the legiſlative power of each may do with regard to itſelf. The exceptions to this rule are to be deduced from the
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:028389_0842_0FD8EFB1D6B7F6B8"/>unfitneſs and inconvenience of its application to particular caſes, and are of the nature of abuſes of a general principle.</p>
                     <p>In conſidering the power of legiſlation in its relations to the power of treaty, inſtead of ſaying, that the objects of the former are excepted out of the latter, it will be more correct, indeed it will be entirely correct, to invert the rule, and to ſay, that the power of treaty is the power of making exceptions, in particular caſes, to the power of legiſlation. The ſtipulations of treaty are, in good faith, reſtraints upon the exerciſe of the laſt mentioned power. Where there is no treaty, it is completely free to act. Where there is a treaty; it is ſtill free to act in all the caſes not ſpecially excepted by the treaty. Thus, congreſs is free to regulate trade with a foreign nation, with whom we have no treaty of commerce, in ſuch manner as they judge for the intereſt of the United States; and they are alſo free ſo to regulate it with a foreign nation with whom we have a treaty, in all the points which the treaty does not ſpecially except. There is always, therefore, great latitude for the exerciſe of the legiſlative power of regulating trade with foreign nations, notwithſtanding any treaties of commerce which may be formed.</p>
                     <p>The effects of a treaty to impoſe reſtraints upon the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power, may, in ſome degree, be exemplified by the caſe of the compacts which the legiſlature itſelf makes, as with regard to the public debt. Its own compacts are, in good faith, exceptions to its power of action. Treaties with foreign powers, for obvious reaſons, are much ſtronger exceptions.</p>

                     <p>THE manner in which the power of treaty, as it exiſts in the conſtitution, was underſtood by the convention in framing it, and by the people in adopting it, is the point next to be conſidered.</p>
                     <p>As to the ſenſe of the convention, the ſecrecy with which their deliberations were conducted, does not permit any formal proof of the opinions and views which prevailed in digeſting the power of treaty—But from the <hi>beſt opportunity of knowing the fact,</hi> I aver, that it was underſtood <hi>by all,</hi> to be the intent of the proviſion to give to that power the moſt ample latitude —to render it competent to all the ſtipulations, which the
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:028389_0843_0FD8EFB3C0A6E2A8"/>exigencies of national affairs might require; competent to the making of treaties of alliance, treaties of commerce, treaties of peace, and every other ſpecies of convention uſual among nations; and competent, in the courſe of its exerciſe for theſe purpoſes, to controul and bind the legiſlative power of congreſs —And it was emphatically for this reaſon, that it was ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully guarded; the co-operation of two-thirds of the ſenate, with the preſident, being required to make any treaty what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever—I appeal for this, with confidence, to every member of the convention—particularly to thoſe in the two houſes of congreſs. Two of theſe are in the houſe of repreſentatives, Mr. Madiſon and Mr. Baldwin: It is expected, by the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of the treaty, that theſe gentlemen will, in their places, obſtruct its execution—However this may be, I feel a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that neither of them will deny the aſſertion I have made—to ſuppoſe them capable of ſuch a denial were to ſuppoſe them utterly regardleſs of truth. But, though direct proof of the views of the convention on the point, cannot be produced; —yet we are not wholly without proof on this head.</p>
                     <p>Three members of the convention diſſented from the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; Mr. Maſon, Mr. Gerry, and Mr. Randolph. Among the reaſons for his diſſent, publiſhed by Mr. Maſon, we find this clauſe, "By declaring all treaties ſupreme laws of the land, the executive and ſenate have, <hi>in many caſes,</hi> an <hi>excluſive power of legiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ation,</hi> which might have been avoided by proper diſtinctions with reſpect to treaties, and <hi>requiring the aſſent of the houſe of repreſentatives</hi> where it could be done with ſafety." —This ſhows the great extent of the power, in the conception of Mr. Maſon: <hi>in many caſes</hi> amounting to an <hi>excluſive power of legiſlation;</hi> nor did he object to the extent, but only deſired that it ſhould have been further guarded, by certain diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and by requiring, in certain caſes, the aſſent of the houſe of repreſentatives.</p>
                     <p>Among the objections to the conſtitution, addreſſed by Mr. Gerry to the legiſlature of Maſſachuſetts, we find one to have been, "that treaties of the <hi>higheſt importance</hi> might be formed by the preſident, with the advice of two-thirds of a <hi>quorum</hi> of the ſenate."—This ſhows his idea of the magnitude of the power; and impliedly admitting with Mr. Maſon, the propriety of its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, he ſeems only to have deſired that the concurrence of the ſenate ſhould have embraced two-thirds of the <hi>whole body,</hi> inſtead of two-thirds of a <hi>quorum.</hi> But how ſmall and how inſignificant would the power of treaty be, according to the doctrine lately promulgated, with regard to its conſtitutional limit?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="268" facs="unknown:028389_0844_0FD8EFB58FF985F8"/>
As to the ſenſe of the community in the adoption of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, this can only be aſcertained from two ſources, the writings for and againſt it, and the debates in the ſeveral ſtate conventions—while it was under conſideration.</p>
                     <p>I poſſeſs not, at this moment, materials for an inveſtigation, which would enable me to preſent the evidence they afford—But I refer to them, with confidence, for proof of the fact, that the organization of the power of treaty, in the cenſtitution, was attacked and defended with an admiſſion on both ſides, of its being of the character which I have aſſigned to it—Its great extent and importance—its effect to controul, by its ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the legiſlative authority, were mutually taken for granted, and, upon this baſis, it was inſiſted, by way of objection— that there were not adequate guards for the ſafe exerciſe of ſo vaſt a power; that there ought to have been reſervations of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain rights, a <hi>better</hi> diſpoſition of the power to impeach, and a participation, general or ſpecial, of the houſe of repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives in the making of treaties.</p>
                     <p>The reply to theſe objections, acknowledging the delicacy and magnitude of the power, was directed to ſhow that its organization was a proper one, and that it was ſufficiently guarded.<note n="*" place="bottom">The Federaliſt No. XLII. has theſe paſſages, "the power to make treaties and to receive and ſend ambaſſadors, ſpeak their own propriety—Both of them are compriſed in the articles of confederation, <hi>with the difference only</hi> that the former is <hi>diſembarraſſed</hi> by the plan of the convention, of an exception by which treaties might be ſubſtantially fruſtrated by regulations of the ſtates." This plainly alludes to the <hi>proviſo</hi> which has been cited and commented upon. "It is true that when treaties of commerce ſtipulate for the appointment of articles, the admiſſion of foreign conſuls may fall within the power of making commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial treaties." And in number LXIV. are theſe paſſages, "the power of making treaties is an important one, eſpecially <hi>as it relates to war, peace and commerce;</hi> and it ſhould not be delegated but in ſuch a mode and with ſuch precautions as will afford the <hi>higheſt ſecurity,</hi> that it will be exerciſed by men the beſt qualified for the purpoſe, and in the manner moſt conducive to the public good." There are few who will not admit, that the affairs of <hi>trade</hi> and <hi>navigation</hi> ſhould be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by a ſyſtem cautiouſly formed and ſteadily purſued, and that both our treaties and our laws ſhould correſpond with, and be made to promote it." "Some are diſpleaſed with it (that is, the power of treaty) not on account of any errors or defects in it, but becauſe, as the treaties, when made are to have the force of laws, they ſhould be made only by men inveſted with legiſlative autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;" "others, though content that treaties ſhould be made in the mode pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, are averſe to their being the <hi>ſupreme law of the land.</hi>"
<p>It is generally underſtood that two perſons were concerned in the writings of theſe papers, who, from having been members of the convention, had a good opportunity of knowing its views—and were under no temptation at that time, in this particular, to miſrepreſent them.</p>
                           <p>In the <hi>addreſs</hi> and reaſons of diſſent of the minority of the convention of Pennſylvania to their conſtituents, "they ſtate, that they had ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This ſhows that it was underſtood that the power of treaty in the conſtitution extended to abrogating even pre-exiſting laws of the United States, which was thought exceptionable; while no objection was made to the idea of its controuling future exerciſes of the legiſlative power— The ſame addreſs ſtates, in another place, that the preſident and ſenate "may form treaties with foreign nations, that may controul and abrogate the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and laws of the ſeveral ſtates."</p>

The manner of exerciſing a ſimilar power under the <hi>confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> ſhall now be examined.</p>
                     <p>To judge of the ſimilarity of the power, it will be uſeful to quote the terms in which it was granted. They are theſe, "The United States in congreſs aſſembled, ſhall have the ſole and excluſive right and power of <hi>entering into treaties and alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, provided that no treaty of commerce</hi> ſhall be made, whereby the legiſlative power of the reſpective ſtates ſhall be reſtrained from impoſing ſuch impoſts and duties on foreigners as their own people are ſubject to, or from prohibiting the importation or exportation of any ſpecies of commodities whatſoever." (Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle IX.)</p>
                     <p>It will not be diſputed that the words "treaties and alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances" are of equivalent import, and of no greater force than the ſingle word "treaties." An alliance is only a ſpecies of treaty, a particular of a general;—and the power of "entering into treaties," which terms confer the authority under which the former government acted, will not be pretended to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ronger than the power "to make treaties," which are the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>rms conſtituting the authority under which the preſent govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment acts; it follows, that the power, reſpecting treaties, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the former, and that under the preſent government, are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>milar.</p>
                     <p>But though ſimilar, that under the preſent government is more comprehenſive; for it is diveſted of the reſtriction in the proviſion cited above, and is fortified by the expreſs declaration, that its acts ſhall be valid notwithſtanding the conſtitution or
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:028389_0846_0FD8EFB854A0E628"/>laws of any ſtate.—This is evidence, (as was the fact) of a diſpoſition in the convention to diſembarraſs and reinforce the power of treaty. It ought not to paſs unnoticed, that an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant argument reſults from the <hi>proviſo,</hi> which accompanies the power granted by the confederation, as to the natural ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of this power. The declaration that no treaty of commerce ſhall be made reſtraining the legiſlative power of a ſtate from impoſing ſuch duties and impoſts on foreigners as their own people are ſubject to, or from prohibiting the importation or exportation of any ſpecies of commodities whatſoever is an admiſſion,

                     <p>Let it not be ſaid, that the proviſo, by implication, granted the power to make treaties of commerce, under which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs afterwards acted; for beſides that this is inconſiſtent with the more obvious meaning of the clauſe, the firſt article of the confederation leaves to the ſtates individually every power <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Under this power, thus granted and defined, the alliance with France was contracted: guaranteeing, in the caſe of a defenſive war, her Weſt India poſſeſſions, and when the <hi>caſus foederis</hi> occurs, obliging the United States to make war for the defence of thoſe poſſeſſions, and conſequently, to incur the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes of war.</p>

                     <p>It is difficult to conceive a higher act of controul, both of the legiſlative and judiciary authority, than by this article. Theſe proviſions are analagous in principle, to thoſe ſtipulations which, in the ſecond and ninth articles of the treaty under ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, have given occaſion to conſtitutional objection.</p>
                     <p>Under the ſame power, various treaties with Indians, inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting the territory of the United States, have been made; eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing arbitrary lines of boundary with them: which determine the right of ſoil on the one ſide and on the other. Some of thoſe treaties proceed on the principle of the United States
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:028389_0848_0FD8EFBF8A881B20"/>having conquered the Indian country, and profeſs to make gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous conceſſions to them of the lands which are left to their occupation. There is alſo a feature of importance common to theſe treaties, which is the withdrawing of the protection of the United States from thoſe of their citizens, who intrude on Indian laws, leaving them to be puniſhed at the pleaſure of the Indians.</p>
                     <p>Hence it appears, that, except as to the ſtipulations for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing commiſſioners, the treaties made under the confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, contain all the features, identically or by analogy, which create conſtitutional objections to the treaty before us: They reſtrain, in certain inſtances, the legiſlative power to lay taxes; they make numerous and important regulations of trade; they confer the benefit of naturalization as to property; they define caſes of piracy; they create cauſes of expenditure; they direct and modify the power of war; they erect, <hi>within the country,</hi> tribunals unknown to our conſtitutions and laws, in caſes to which theſe are competent—whereas the treaty with Great Britain only provides for the appointment of <hi>arbitrators</hi> in caſes to which our tribunals and laws are incompetent; and they make diſpoſitions concerning the territory and property of the United States.</p>

Thoſe with Great Britain, Sweden, Ruſſia, and Morocco, and the convention with France, were poſterior to the completion of that compact.</p>
                     <p>It may, perhaps, be argued, that a more extenſive conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the power of treaty, in the confederation, than in one preſent conſtitution, was countenanced by the union in the ſame body of legiſlative powers with the power of treaty.

                     <p>If in theory the objects of legiſlative power are excepted out of the power of treaty, this muſt have been equally, at leaſt, the caſe with the legiſlative powers of the ſtate gove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> force of the power of treaty could have enabled it to penetrate the ſeparate ſpheres of the ſtate governments. The practice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the confederation for ſo many years, acquieſced in by all the ſtates, is, therefore, a concluſive illuſtration of the power of treaty, and an irreſiſtible refutation of the novel and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous doctrine, which impeaches the conſtitutionality of that lately negociated—If the natural import of the terms uſed in the conſtitution were leſs clear and deciſive than they are, that practice is a commentary upon them, and fixes their ſenſe. For the ſenſe in which certain terms were practiſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a prior conſtitution of government, muſt be preſumed to have been intended, in uſing the like terms in a ſubſequent conſtitution of government for the ſame nation.</p>
                     <p>Accordingly, the practice under the preſent government be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the late treaty, has correſponded with that ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>Our treaties with ſeveral Indian nations regulate and change the boundaries between them and the United States—And in addition to compenſations in groſs, they ſtipulate the payment of certain ſpecific and perpetual annuities. Thus a treaty in Auguſt, 1790, with the Creeks (article 5) promiſes them the pearly ſum of one thouſand five hundred dollars—And ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar features are found in ſubſequent treaties with the Six Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Cherokees, and the North Weſtern Indians—This laſt has <hi>juſt</hi> been ratified by the <hi>unanimous voice</hi> of the ſenate. It ſtipulates an annuity of 9500 dollars—and relinquiſhes to the Indians, a large tract of land which they had, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding treaties, ceded to the United States.</p>
                     <p>Hence we find that our former treaties under the preſent government, as well as one ſubſequent to that under conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, contradict the doctrine ſet up againſt its conſtitutional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity—in the important particulars of making diſpoſitions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the territory and property of the United States, and binding them to raiſe and pay money. Theſe treaties have not only been made by the preſident, and ratified by the ſenate, without any impeachment of their conſtitutionality, but the houſe of repreſentatives has heretofore concurred, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out objection, in carrying them into effect, by the requiſite appropriation of money.</p>
                     <p>The conſular convention with France ſtands in a peculiar predicament. It was negociated under the former government, and ratified under the preſent; and ſo may be regarded as a treaty of both governments, illuſtrative of the extent of the power of treaty in both. The delicate and even the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:028389_0850_0FD8EFC62F6A4A58"/>nature of the proviſions it contains, have been adverted to. Though all reflecting men have thought ill of the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſome of them, as inconveniently breaking in upon our interior adminiſtration, legiſlative, executive, and judiciary; only acquieſcing in them from the difficulty of getting rid of ſtipulations entered into by our public agents under competent powers, yet no queſtion has been heard about their conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onality. And congreſs have, by law, aſſiſted their execution by making our judicial tribunals, and the public force of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, auxiliary to the decrees of the foreign tribunals which they authorize within our territory.</p>
                     <p>If it ſhould be ſaid, that our conſtitution, by making all former treaties and engagements as obligatory upon the United States, under that conſtitution, as they were under the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, rendered the ratification of the convention a matter of neceſſity—the anſwer is, that either the engagements, which it contracted, were already concluſive, or they were not—if the former, there was no need of a ratification; if the latter, there was no abſolute obligation to it. And, in every ſuppoſition, a ratification, by the preſident, with the conſent of the ſenate, could have been predicated only upon the power given in the preſent conſtitution in relation to treaties; and to have any va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity, muſt have been within the limit of that power.</p>
                     <p>But it has been heretofore ſeen that the inference from this inſtrument is no leſs ſtrong, if referred to the power under the confederation, than if referred to the power under the preſent conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>How happens it, that all theſe invaſions of the conſtitution, if they were ſuch, were never diſcovered, and that all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments of the government, and all parties in the public councils ſhould have co-operated in giving them a ſanction? Does it not prove that all were convinced, that the power of treaty, applied in our exterior relations to objects, which, in the ordinary courſe of internal adminiſtration and in reference to ourſelves, were of the cognizance of the legiſlative power? and particularly that the former was competent to bind the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the delicate points of raiſing and appropriating money? If competent to this, what legiſlative power can be more ſacred, more out of its reach?</p>
                     <p>Let me now aſk (and a very ſolemn queſtion it is, eſpecially for thoſe who are bound by oath to ſupport the conſtitution) Has it not been demonſtrated that the proviſions in the treaty are juſtified by the true and manifeſt interpretation of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution—are ſanctioned by the practice upon a ſimilar power under the confederation, and by the practice in other inſtances under the preſent government?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="275" facs="unknown:028389_0851_0FD8EFCA0F3F32C0"/>
If this has been demonſtrated, what ſhall we think of the candor and ſincerity of the objections which have been erected on the baſis of a contrary ſuppoſition? Do they not unequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocally prove, that the adverſaries of the treaty have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to diſcredit it by every artifice they could invent? that they have not had truth for their guide, and conſequently are very unfit guides for the public opinion, very unſafe guardians of the public welfare?</p>
                     <p>It is really painful and diſguſting to obſerve ſophiſms ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable as thoſe which queſtion the conſtitutionality of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, retailed to an enlightened people, and inſiſted upon with ſo much ſeeming fervency and earneſtneſs—It is impoſſible not to beſtow on ſenſible men, who act this part, the imputation of hypocriſy—The abſurdity of the doctrine is too glaring to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit even charity itſelf to ſuppoſe it ſincere—If it were poſſible to imagine that a majority in any branch of our government, could betray the conſtitution, and trifle with the nation, ſo far as to adopt and act upon ſuch a doctrine—it would be time to deſpair of the republic.</p>
                     <p>There would be no ſecurity at home, no reſpectability abroad. Our conſtitutional charter would become a dead letter. The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan of our government for foreign affairs would be treated with de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THE treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation, lately concluded in London between Lord Grenville and Mr. Jay, on the part of the king of Great Britain and the United States, reſpectively, is one of the moſt important ſubjects ever agitated in America ſince ſhe became an independent nation; it ſeems, indeed, to have engroſſed the public mind more than any other, the adoption of the federal conſtitution, only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.—Reaſon, prejudice, and paſſion, equally prompt to the diſcuſſion of it, and every individual enliſts himſelf u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

This renders a temperate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into its merits, without regard, either to the original framers, or its ſubſequent advocates or enemies, an object of the firſt importance. I ſhall, therefore, leave it to others to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs, whether the late envoy extraordinary entered upon, and concluded it, in purſuance of <hi>general</hi> or <hi>particular</hi> inſtructions, either from the preſident of the United States <hi>alone,</hi> or <hi>by</hi> and <hi>with</hi> the <hi>advice</hi> and <hi>conſent</hi> of <hi>the ſenate;</hi> or whether, he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued the di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But, before entering into a diſcuſſion of the articles of the treaty, it may not be improper to advert, not only to exiſting circumſtances at the time it was concluded, but to ſome ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent events, which may be preſumed to have had ſome ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration upon the minds of the nations, whoſe mutual friendſhip is, by this inſtrument, propoſed to be conciliated, and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually cemented. For a treaty (ſo far as relates to a free republic at leaſt) ought to be conſidered as the act of the nation, and not merely of the government, only; or, in other words, of the parties who conclude, ſign, and ratify them. To this end, due attention ſhould be paid to the prevailing ſentiment of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo as to remove every obſtacle to that cordiality, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned friendſhip, which treaties of amity are intended to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote.</p>
                  <p>It is juſt twenty years ſince the United States of America, ſtimulated by the tyrannical uſurpations of the preſent king of Great Britian, declared the good people of theſe ſtates abſolved from their allegiance to that prince, and that all political con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with Great Britain ought to be totally diſſolved. A cruel civil war was waged againſt them during a period of eight years, the calamities of which were heightened by every wanton act of depredation, oppreſſion, and inſult, that rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, cruelty, and a vindictive ſpirit could prompt men to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Inability to proſecute the war longer, produced a peace; but it was peace without for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, without friendſhip, and without ſincerity. During the long courſe of hoſtilities, every ſentiment of regard and of mutual confidence had been extinguiſhed on the part of both nations, and the peace concluted between them, was rather calculated to perpetuate, than to extinguith the remembrance of their mutual ani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="278" facs="unknown:028389_0854_0FD8EFD01C3121F0"/>been overlooked, or ſacrificed, by ſome of the articles of the treaty. The northern ſtates found their trade abridged, by the very inſtrument which they ſuppoſed would have ſecured its unlimited extenſion. Thus even the treaty of peace had no other recommendation, in the eyes of the people of America, than the termination of hoſtility. His Britannic majeſty, on the ether hand, appears not to have entered into it with good faith. The weſtern poſts, which were to have been delivered up "with all convenient ſpeed," were forcibly detained in the poſſeſſion of his troops; and the negroes and other property taken from the people of America, were, in direct violation of the treaty, carried away without compenſation. An equal diſpoſition to evade, or violate ſome of the articles of the treaty was attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to ſeveral of the ſtates, and mutual complaints and recri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations took place between the two nations. The reſtraints impoſed upon our Weſt India commerce by his Britannic ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; his <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> ill offices towards us, in exciting the depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the Barbary ſtates upon our commerce; and in fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting diſcontents among the Indian nations, and even ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating and aiding them in acts of hoſtility againſt us, occaſioned thoſe wounds to inflame and feſter anew, which had been, at beſt, imperfectly cicatriſed.</p>

                  <p>The conſtitution, at the time of its adoption, was regarded as the guarantee of a free trade with the Weſt Indies, and with every other part of the world; it ſoon became matter of wonder and of dina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="279" facs="unknown:028389_0855_0FD8EFD24710EDF0"/>the Britiſh court on the ſubject of a treaty of commerce, and that the propoſition ſtill continued to be treated with diſreſpect. —In the mean time, France was engaged in a revolution, the principles of which were ſuppoſed to bear ſo great an analogy to our own, that every American felt himſelf intereſted in her ſucceſs.—Our prayers were continually offered up in her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, and it was concluded that the cords of amity would be drawn as cloſely as poſſible between the two republics.—His Britannic majeſty was not long in joining the alliance formed among the enemies of the new republic. America ſoon found herſelf made a party in the war, <hi>by her ſufferings:</hi> the ſpoliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on our commerce are well known; they have been felt through every part of the United States. Not only our veſſels with their cargoes were ſeized and confiſcated, becauſe engaged in commerce with the enemies of his Britannic majeſty; but our citizens were abuſed in their perſons, impriſoned or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed into the ſervice of a ſovereign whom they deteſted, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretext that they were his ſubjects. Innumerable acts of piracy were committed by a ſwarm of privateers which infeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our coaſts; nor was the inſolence practiſed by his Britannic majeſty's ſea officers inferior to the depredations of the priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers. Stimulated by reſentment, and a deſire of retaliation, ſome of the citizens of America took commiſſions from, or entered into the ſervice of, their ſiſter republic. They were proſecuted for exerciſing a natural right, not repugnant to any treaty, or known law of the land. Theſe proſecutions were, by the ſufferers and their friends, conſidered as an act of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>errogation in our government, founded on a partiality to Britiſh intereſt, in oppoſition to that of France. Every act of conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or conciliation on the part of the United States, ſeemed to give new life and vigour to the arrogance, inſolence, and depredations of the Britiſh ſhips of war and cruiſers. The Indians, whoſe hoſtile diſpoſition towards us was ſuppoſed to be the effect of Britiſh perfidy, proſecuted the war againſt us in a ſtile altogether new, and gave reaſon to preſume that they were not only aided with arms, ammunition, and warlike ſtores, by the Britiſh government, but that they were actually aſſiſted by the officers and militia, if not by the regular troops of that nation. CONGRESS, to whom it belongs to decide upon a <hi>juſt cauſe of war,</hi> and to <hi>regulate commerce,</hi> rouſed by ſo many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated acts of aggreſſion, had reſolved upon ſome cautionary meaſures to ſecure indemnification for injury, and to retaliate upon a nation from whom ſo many vexations were daily receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The repreſentatives of the people concurred in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures propoſed, by a great majority—the ſenate were divided—
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:028389_0856_0FD8EFD30B15BCF0"/>the vice-preſident held <hi>the balance</hi> in his hand, and the ſcale preponderated againſt the repreſentatives of the people. At this moment of efferveſcence in the public mind, the late en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy extraordinary was appointed; the object of his miſſion was ſuppoſed to be a demand of reparation of injuries, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the terms of the violated treaty of peace.</p>
                  <p>From this ſhort recapitulation of preceding events, it will appear, that the public mind was by no means prepared to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with cordiality, into a ſtate of amity with a nation whoſe government had, for twenty years, inceſſantly perſecuted the United States, either by open acts of hoſtility, or the inſidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous arts of ſecret animoſity. It was, therefore, reaſonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that a treaty, whoſe object was to bind the two nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in amity with each other, would contain within it every thing neceſſary to ſoften aſperity—to ſubdue reſentment—to ſatisfy claims, and to conciliate affection. To determine how far this expectation has been fulfilled by the preſent treaty, it will be neceſſary, not only to ſtate what it <hi>contains,</hi> but alſo, what it does <hi>not contain.</hi> I ſhall begin with the former; and, in order to do it with the more regularity, I ſhall take it article by article.</p>
                  <p>The preamble ſtates the motives to the treaty to be, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire "of terminating the differences between his Britan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Such a preamble would either lead us to expect the moſt <hi>liberal conceſſions</hi> in favor of the United States, or a <hi>total dereliction</hi> of their complaints by the envoy extraordinary. On the part of his Britannic majeſty ſuch a waver might be conſidered, if not a mark of great magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, at leaſt, of great condeſcenſion, whilſt his ſhips of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> and privateers were in the full career of plunder on the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of our unreſiſting citizens. Nor can it be altogether denied, that his majeſty, as well as the United States, had ſome cauſe to murmur at the events of his reign:—He had loſt an immenſe territory, which he had regarded as his here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary right, <hi>jure divino,</hi> and had ſpent above an hundred mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions ſterling of his ſubjects' money in the attempt to retain it in ſubjection to him. He might be compared to an unlucky ſportſman whoſe over-charged gun had burſted, burnt his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, given him a ſound douſe in the chaps, and knock'd out half a dozen of his teeth, in attempting to ſhoot a partridge: —and America to the poor bird itſelf, which had got a griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wound, in ſpite of the unſkilfulneſs of the aukward
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:028389_0857_0FD8EFD81DF7F770"/>markſman. Conſidering, however, the preſumable object of the miſſion of the envoy extraordinary, it appears ſomewhat unaccountable upon what grounds he could-ſuppoſe himſelf authorized to relinquiſh the diſcuſſion of the complaints of the United States, unleſs indeed he apprehended that his Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic majeſty's choler might be ſo far rouſed by it, as again to reject a negociation, and compel him to return to America <hi>re infecta:</hi>

But let us now proceed to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the treaty, ſome of the articles of which I ſhall paſs over without obſervation, as being either of little moment, or cuſtomary in ſimilar treaties; whilſt upon ſome others I may wiſh to detain the reader's attention.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of eight and twenty articles which the treaty contains, the firſt ten are declared to be <hi>permanent;</hi> the remainder are of limited duration. The firſt ſtipulates, in the ordinary form, that there ſhall be peace, "and true and ſincere friendſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Britannic majeſty and his ſucceſſors, and the United States, and between the people, reſpectively, without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of perſons or places."—To render this article effectual, it will be neceſſary that the ſubſequent articles ſhould contain <hi>all ſuch things</hi> as "are calculated to produce mutual ſatisfaction and good underſtanding between the nations:" otherwiſe, this article will ever remain in the ſame ſtate of <hi>inexecution,</hi> as thoſe relating to the <hi>negroes</hi> and the <hi>weſtern poſts,</hi> in the treaty of peace.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. The ſecond article ſtipulates that his Britannic majeſty <hi>will</hi> withdraw all his troops and garriſons from all poſts and places within the United States, on or before the firſt day of June, 1796. This, by the treaty of peace, ought to have been done, <hi>at leaſt, a dozen years ago;</hi> and it appears ſomewhat ſtrange that the immediate performance of it was not made a condition, precedent to any further negociation, except for reparation for the ſpoliations on our commerce, &amp;c. for how can we be aſſured that his Britannic majeſte <hi>will</hi> obſerve more good faith in the performance of this treaty, than the former, if an excuſe can be found to evade it? The only difference
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:028389_0858_0FD8EFD9212296F8"/>that this part of the ſecond article makes between our preſent and former ſituation is, that the detention of the poſts, <hi>hitherts</hi> is evidently <hi>ſanctioned</hi> by the preſent treaty; and all <hi>compenſation</hi> for former breaches of faith, and aggreſſions in this reſpect, moſt <hi>generouſly waved,</hi> on the part of the United States; it muſt be confeſſed, however, that this article furniſhes an interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the words "<hi>with all convenient ſpeed,</hi>" in the former treaty; which, in all future negociations, with his Britannic majeſty, may be underſtood to mean <hi>a dozen years.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame article provides that the ſettlers and traders, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the precincts or juriſdiction of the weſtern poſts, may <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to reſide there, without being compelled to become citizens of the United States, or to take any oaths of allegiance to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereofs,</hi> or remove and diſpoſe of their lands and other property, at their election. This, as it reſpects traders, and other <hi>tranſient</hi> perſons, is juſt and proper: as it relates to <hi>land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders</hi> it will be made the ſubject of future remark, when we examine the ninth article.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. The third article contains a variety of ſtipulations, ſome of which appear to be reciprocally liberal, whilſt others mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt a ſpirit of accommodation and conceſſion, on the part of the United States, which very few are likely to feel, in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, equal to the envoy extraordinary.—If it be true that the moſt important ſtations for carrying on the fur trade, &amp;c. are within the territories of the United States, which, I am told, is the caſe, Great Britain will be no ſmall gainer by that equal intercourſe, which this article permits upon the lakes and the waters thereof, as alſo the free uſe of the Miſſiſſippi,<note n="*" place="bottom">It may, with no ſmall propriety, be aſked, on what part of the eaſtern ſide of the Miſſiſſippi his Britannic majeſty poſſeſſes any territory? I know of none; and it might, perhaps, puzzle the envoy extraordinary himſelf to point it out.</note> and the portage places in the territories of the United States and Great Britain, reſpectively. But the <hi>total excluſion of American veſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>
                     </hi> from the ſea-ports, harbours, creeks, and rivers of the Britiſh American territories on the Atlantic, gives to this article a very diſadvantageous turn for the commercial intereſts of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States; thereby ſecuring to the Britiſh nation a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided</hi> and <hi>perpetual pre-eminence</hi> over them in the trade with the north-weſtern parts of the American republic; ſince all articles for exportation to foreign parts, muſt either go down the St. Lawrence and be exported to <hi>Britain,</hi> in <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſhips, or be <hi>brought over land</hi> to the head waters of Hudſon's river, or ſome other leſs convenient communication with the Atlantic ports of the United States—Foreign goods muſt be tranſported
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:028389_0859_0FD8EFDAA39CCA70"/>to the weſtern territories in like manner. The communication from the lakes to Quebec, by the river St. Lawrence, is ſo much eaſier than to New York, by the river Hudſon,<note n="*" place="bottom">Mothing appears more queſtionable than that policy, which lays open the navigation of our rivers to thoſe maritime powers with whom we may be even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall engaged in war. Experience <hi>might</hi> have taught us this truth in the courſe of our war with Great Britain.</note> and the advantages (if I am rightly informed) in every reſpect ſo much greater, as to preclude all competition on the part of the United States. Hence it ſeems probable that Great Britain will continue to monopolize the trade on the lakes, and finally, the whole trade of the American north weſtern territory. Other cauſes than thoſe already mentioned will contribute to promote this. <hi>Britiſh traders</hi> are already ſettled at the <hi>moſt advantageous ſtations</hi> for carrying on commerce, and probably have poſſeſſed themſelves of <hi>all the land</hi> at thoſe places, which the preceding article ſecures to them <hi>for ever.</hi> An American going there to ſettle would find himſelf under all the diſadvantages of attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to eſtabliſh himſelf in a foreign country, and expoſed to all the ill offices which jealouſy could ſuggeſt.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not here enquire how far the United States had a right to inſiſt on the free navigation of the river St. Lawrence, at leaſt for their veſſels bound from one part of the United States to another, reſerving that queſtion for another place; but it is obſervable, that while our veſſels are totally excluded from the Atlantic ports of Canada, &amp;c. the veſſels of thoſe countries may freely navigate our rivers<note n="†" place="bottom">The writer, for want of a correct map, and deſcription of thoſe parts of the United States is unable to deſcend to ſuch particulars as would illuſtrate this part of his ſubject.</note> as far as the higheſt ports of entry for foreign ſhips, in any part of the United States. This want of reciprocity will be excuſed by the advosates for the treaty, by a general reference to colonial laws; to which I ſhall offer an anſwer in its proper place.</p>
                  <p>Commercial regulations, not founded in experience, can never be adopted with too much caution. They ought never to find a place in a perpetual treaty; for whatever inconvenience or diſadvantage reſult from them, it cannot be removed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hazarding a war; ſince it can never be expected that a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical nation, tenacious of her intereſts, will ever reſign an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that is once ſecured by a perpetual treaty. Such a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the Britiſh.</p>

The ſecond caſe applicable to this article, I preſume, will ariſe from the operation of an act of the legiſlature of Virginia, paſſed in the year 1787, repealing all acts of aſſembly which prohibited the recovery of Britiſh debts, with a ſuſpending clauſe, <hi>until the Britiſh poſts in the United States ſhould be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up,</hi> and meaſures taken for the <hi>further fulfilment</hi> of the treaty, by <hi>delivering up the negroes</hi> of the citizens of that ſtate, <hi>taken away contrary to the ſeventh article of the treaty of peace.</hi> How far this legal impediment might operate to delay the debt of a Britiſh creditor, or to leſſen its value, or ſecurity, I cannot preſume to ſay; yet I ſhould conclude that the adoption of the federal conſtitution a few months after, did very effectually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move this legal impediment.

They uniformly diſregarded the inſtruction; it was neceſſary to provide ſome remedy in this, as well as in the firſt mentioned caſe, and it is probable that the opinion of the chief juſtice of the United States will be paid due reſpect to, by the commiſſioners to be appointed in virtue of this article.

It has been hinted that this court of commiſſioners (a part of whom, as was before obſerved, are to be <hi>Britiſh</hi>) who are thus to liquidate legal claims by one individual againſt another, is an encroachment upon the functions of the federal judiciary, and a violation of the conſtitution. The queſtion is delicate and important; there is, moreover, an obſcurity in this article, which makes it difficult to aſcertain its real import. It may not be improper to notice ſome parts of it, with a view to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of this queſtion.—1ſt, The award of the commiſſioners ſhall be <hi>final</hi> in all caſes, <hi>both as to the juſtice of the claim,</hi> and the amount to be paid the creditor, 2d, The United States un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to <hi>cauſe</hi> the ſum awarded to be paid, &amp;c. on condition of ſuch <hi>releaſes</hi> or <hi>aſſignments</hi> to be given by the creditor, as the commiſſioners may direct—Is it meant that the award ſhall be final and concluſive between the <hi>creditor,</hi> and the original debtor? If ſo, he muſt be made a <hi>party defendant,</hi> and that, I preſume, by regular <hi>proceſs:</hi> he muſt be heard in his defence; he ought to have <hi>compulſory proceſs</hi> to procure the attendance of <hi>witneſſes;</hi> the truth of the <hi>facts put in iſſue are to be tried and determined</hi> by the commiſſioners. IT BELONGS TO THE CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STITUTIONAL COURTS TO DO ALL THESE THINGS; and
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:028389_0863_0FD8EFE2AA9ED7C8"/>the <hi>trial of matters of fact</hi> put in iſſue muſt there be by a JURY. Again, the United States undertake to <hi>cauſe</hi> the money awarded to be paid. How? By proceſs of execution againſt the defendant's body or eſtate? Or, out of the treaſury of the United States, truſting for reimburſement to the aſſignment from the creditor? How are they to recover in virtue of this aſſignment? By harraſſing the debtor with a new ſuit, or is he bound to all intents and purpoſes by the award of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners? Theſe things are difficult to be underſtood, and ſtill more difficult to reconcile to that clauſe of the conſtitution, which declares that the judiciary power of the United States ſhall be <hi>veſted in one ſupreme court,</hi> and ſuch inferior courts as <hi>congreſs</hi> may, from time to time, <hi>eſtabliſh;</hi> that the <hi>judges</hi> ſhall hold their offices <hi>during good behavious;</hi> that they ſhall take an oath to ſupport the conſtitution of the United States; and that the juriſdiction of theſe courts ſhall extend to <hi>all caſes</hi> in <hi>law</hi> and <hi>equity</hi> ariſing under the conſtitution, or laws of the United States, and <hi>treaties made,</hi> or <hi>which ſhall be made</hi> under their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. The great tenderneſs of the envoy extraordinary for the caſe of Britiſh creditors, ſeems to have made him forget that he preſided in one of thoſe courts, whoſe juriſdiction extends to <hi>all caſes ariſing under treaties;</hi> a circumſtance which can only be attributed to his being ſo much engroſſed by his <hi>new office,</hi> as not only to forget the <hi>functions and duties of that which he had left behind,</hi> but even the <hi>conſtitution of his country.</hi>

                  <p n="7">VII. The ſucceeding article relates to the compenſation to be made to the citizens of the United States, for the ſpoliations and depredations committed on our commerce, and to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Great Britain for ſuch captures as have been made within the juriſdiction of the United States, or by veſſels armed therein. For this purpoſe a ſimilar board of commiſſioners, with nearly ſimilar powers, are to ſit in LONDON, who are to decide the claims referred to them according to juſtice, equity, and the laws of nations; and the Britiſh government under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to pay the ſum awarded to the claimants in ſpecie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deduction.

That of the commanders of ſhips of war but too often partakes more of the inſolence of a <hi>baſhaw</hi> than the courteſy of a ſoldier of honor. The ſpoliations com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted on the property of the citizens of America by theſe two claſſes of men, muſt have been often attended with circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of inconvenience to the ſuffers, far beyond the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent amount of the injury offered. I have known a profitable voyage defeated, and the veſſel finally loſt, by being plundered of a few ſail-needles, and twine, to the value of leſs than four dollars. The detention of an hour, or being turned out of her courſe for a day, may prove equally fatal to a merchant ſhip. Theſe are injuries for which no reparation in damages, eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated merely according to the value of the thing taken, or the time of detention, can make adequate ſatisfaction; acts of depredation and violence committed by perſons unknown, to whoſe reſidence we are ſtrangers, or whoſe reſidence is at too great a diſtance to follow them in hopes of ſatisfaction, are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſubmitted to, from deſpair of obtaining any compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

According to the principles laid down in Calvin's caſe [Co. rep. part 7.] when two countries, which have been under alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to the ſame prince, ſeparate, all thoſe of either country <hi>born before the ſeparation</hi> takes place, may hold, or inhetic lands in that country from which they are thus ſeparated. Upon this principle the treaty of peace ſecured to the owners of lands in America, being Britiſh ſubjects, all their poſſeſſions in lands <hi>at that time held by them.</hi> And the reaſonalbe conſtruction ſeemed to be, that they ſhould have their whole lives to diſpoſe of them, or to become American citizens; if they did neither, the lands would be liable to eſcheat at their death, for defect of heirs, unleſs ſome <hi>ante-natus,</hi> or ſome American citizen, could eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh his claim therero, either as heir, or deviſee. For it was held, that the common law, which excludes aliens from inheriting, was not altered, or intended to be altered, by that article. And the reaſons for that opinion were not without weight in the minds of thoſe who maintained them; ſince they conceived that the principle of excluding aliens from holding lands was founded in found policy; adopting herein one of the reaſons of the common law of England, <hi>"that the nation might in time be ſubject to foreign influence."</hi>—In giving the moſt liberal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to the treaty of peace, they did not apprehend it was meant to contravene a principle ſo long eſtabliſhed among their anceſtors, and ſo generally underſtood. As to acquiſitions of lands, made by Britiſh ſubjects, in America, ſince the peace, the queſtion, whether theſe are within the reaſon of the caſe of <hi>ante-nati,</hi> has not occurred: whenever it does, it is not impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that a diſtinction may be taken between a title acquired by <hi>deſcent</hi> or <hi>deviſe,</hi> and one by <hi>actrual purchaſe,</hi> ſince the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune vinculum</hi> has been broken.

The tenth article ſtipulates that there ſhall be no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtration or confiſcation of debts, or property in the funds, or in public or private banks, in any event of war between the two nations.—One of the reaſons upon which this article was probably founded, was ſlightly touched upon above—His Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannic majeſty, it is ſaid, either allured by the proſpect of

                  <p>But this article deſerves further conſideration in another point of view. When Great Britain, in the courſe of the late war, began to exerciſe every act of depredation upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the people of America, as well as cruelty upon their perſons, the ſtates, then ſovereign and independent, by way of retaliation, thought proper to ſequeſter and confiſcate Britiſh property in America.<note n="*" place="bottom">This was done at the <hi>"earneſt recommendation"</hi> of Congreſs, November 27, 1777.—See their journals.</note> And when his Britannic majeſty's ſhips of war and privateers, commenced their preſent ſyſtem of ſpoliation and aggreſſion on the commerce of the citizens of America, the <hi>houſe of repreſentatives in congreſs, by a very large majority,</hi> reſolved to ſequeſter Britiſh property in the United States, in order to <hi>ſecure ſome indemnification</hi> to their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſtituents.

And if the relative force of the two nations renders this impoſſible by other means, by what refinement in political morality are we forbidden to avail ourſelves of ſuch means of retaliation or indemnification as the nature of things permits?

His zeal for negociation ſeems to have made him loſe ſight of every other object: and no doubt, from the expedition, with which this important treaty was concluded, every obſtacle, which might for a moment retard its completion, was inſtantly waved on the ſide of the American negociator.</p>
                  <p>Not leſs extraordinary is the ſtipulation contained in the ſucceeding clauſe of the ſame article, which declares, that during the continuance thereof, the United States will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit and reſtrain the carrying <hi>any melaſſes, coffee, cocoa,</hi> or <hi>cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> in American veſſels, either from the <hi>ſugar iſlands,</hi> or the <hi>United States,</hi> to any part of the world, except the United States. Never was a more humiliating conceſſion propoſed or acceded to, in a commercial treaty. The interdiction extends not only to the produce of the Engliſh ſugar iſlands, but to ſimilar productions from any other part of the globe. This was a decided ſtroke at the commerce between America and the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions of every other nation in the Weſt Indies, whether French, Dutch, Spaniſh, Daniſh, or Swediſh! Britain ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the produce of her iſlands ſufficient for the conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the United States, or rather, determining, if poſſible, to limit their conſumption to what her iſlands can ſupply, thus ſecures a monopoly by interdicting the exportation of any ſurplus of their productions, or ſimilar productions of other countries; and moreover, lays a foundation for the right of <hi>ſearching</hi> all our veſſels, and, upon the ſlighteſt pretext, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining or carrying them into her own ports for <hi>adjudication,</hi> if it ſhould appear that they have on board any of theſe arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles <hi>beyond reaſonable ſea-ſtores.</hi> Surely by ſome ſtrange effect of magic, the envoy extraordinary had loſt ali memory of events ſubſequent to the year 1763, and conceived himſelf bound to receive as law, whatever the Britiſh ſecretary of ſtate was pleaſed to dictate to him! Or was this conceſſion the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of his fears for the fate of the French colonies, that they would either be deſolated, or become an appendage to Great Britain? Or did he conceive that ſuch a <hi>reſtricted</hi> commerce as he has ſtipulated for with the Britiſh colonies, <hi>clogged with reſtrictions upon our commerce with all other parts of the globe,</hi> was more valuable than all our Weſt India trade put together? Surely the productions of thoſe iſlands muſt have been render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed precious beyond meaſure in the eyes of the envoy extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary when he conſented to this article!</p>
                  <p>There is yet another light in which this article muſt be placed, to give us a full view of its merits. <hi>Congreſs,</hi> that is, the <hi>houſe of repreſentatives</hi> and <hi>ſenate,</hi> with the concurrence of

Conceſſion following conceſſion fills up almoſt the whole that remains to be conſidered of this ill-favored treaty. <hi>Ship-timber, tar, hemp, ſails, ſheet-copper,</hi> and <hi>generally what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may ſerve directly for the equipment of veſſels,</hi> unwrought iron and fir plank excepted, are by this article added to the liſt of contraband goods, though <hi>expreſsly excepted</hi> by former mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with other nations. Upon what principle was this new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion made to Great Britain, in preference to all other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Was it, becauſe theſe articles are deemed of the firſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to <hi>France</hi> during the preſent war? Did the envoy extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary recollect that moſt of theſe are <hi>ſtaple commodities</hi> of the United States? That to make them <hi>contraband</hi> amounts to <hi>an actual prohibition of the exportation of them in our own veſſels,</hi> whenever Great Britain chooſes to go to war? Will nor the powers at war with Great Britain, challenge an equal right to conſider theſe articles as contraband, and ſeize and confiſcate them in their turn, if deſtined for our <hi>new, favorite</hi> ally?</p>
                  <p>The ſame article admits, that proviſions and other articles in general <hi>not contraband,</hi> may, in certain caſes, become contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, according to the exiſting law of nations. Until the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent war with France, the right of interdicting commerce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a neutral nation and an enemy, was, by the <hi>modern h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p n="19">XIX. The nineteenth article ſtipulates, that the commanders of ſhips of war and privateers ſhall forbear doing damage, or committing any outrage on thoſe of the other party; and if they act contrary, they ſhall be puniſhed and make reparation. I have before noticed the probable effect of this ſtipulation; it may prevent ſome <hi>few enormous injuries,</hi> but will not in the leaſt check leſſer abuſes. That inſolence, and thoſe leſs atroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous acts of vexation and oppreſſion, which the <hi>baſhaws of the ſea,</hi> and thoſe licenſed pirates, <hi>privateerſmen,</hi> are ſo prone to commit, will ſtill continue to be exerciſed with all the wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of conſcious ſecurity, and impunity. A cruiſer belonging to one of the Britiſh iſlands, ſtops a ſhip bound to Europe; ſearches her; rifles her; inſults the captain; abuſes his ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; impreſſes ſome of them, under pretext that they are Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh ſubjects; and after all theſe atrocities, permits the ſhip to proceed. What ſatisfaction can be obtained in ſuch a caſe? Shall the maſter of the merchant ſhip alter his voyage, and go to the port to which the privateer belongs, to obtain reparation? The idea is abſurd. He muſt ſubmit to the ill treatment he has received, and conſider his deliverance from the hands of ſuch ruffians, as ample recompence for his ſufferings.

                  <p>A variety of other obſervations, equally important, might, no doubt, have ſuggeſted themſelves to a perſon who had full leiſure to examine this ſubject, and may be met with in the ſeveral publications that have already appeared. Without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to abilities extenſive enough to embrace the whole, I ſhall now haſten to a concluſion.</p>
                  <p>I am well aware that it will be contended by the advocates for the treaty, that a refuſal to ratify it will bring on a war; or muſt continue matters between us and Great Britain, in their preſent ſtate of unredreſſed wrongs, and a paſſive acquieſcence therein. I ſhall add a few words by way of anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As to the danger of producing a war. 1ſt, The refuſal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> are at peace, unleſs ſuch refuſal ſhould amount to a denial of juſt compenſation for injuries complained of, is no cauſe of war between nations. Whenever Great Britain may chooſe to commence a war with the United States, ſhe will not want a pretext. At preſent the treaty itſelf is the moſt unequivocal proof, that ſhe hath ſcarcely the ſhadow of complaint; for the caſes to which the ſixth article can extend, even with all the latitude which the liberality of the envoy extraordinary hath given it, are not attributable to the want either of national faith or juſtice, but to the operation of thoſe means of ſelf-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence which the law of nations permits, or of general laws, founded on the emergencies of the times. The detention of the weſtern poſts, alone, would more than balance the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, in a ſingle year, if ſtated according to the principles of juſtice. As to the captures made within the juriſdiction of the United States, or by veſſels armed therein, Mr. Jefferſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of complaint, on that head. 2d, Great Britain derives ſuch immenſe advantages from her commerce with America, that nothing ſhort of a ſtate of lunacy could prompt to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt it, for the ſake of reparation on either of the before mentioned accounts. 3d, The immenſe property which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p n="2">2. As to the redreſs of wrongs. This is ſo partial and inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate in the preſent treaty, that no great injury can accrue from delaying to accept it; nor does the treaty contain ſuch ſecurity againſt the repetition of them, as ſhould prompt us, on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, to accept of the partial compenſation that it holds forth. Much leſs are the compenſation and ſecurity provided by the treaty, ſuch as ought to be accepted in lieu of <hi>thoſe claims</hi> which are paſſed over in <hi>ſilence.</hi> The ſurrender of the weſtern poſts, were it not by the terms of this treaty an object greatly dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in its importance to the United States, is an event ſtill ſo <hi>remote</hi> (not to add <hi>uncertain</hi>) as not to juſtify the precipitate adoption of a meaſure calculated to impair the value of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, or render it totally uſeleſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3d, The ſuſpenſion of the 12th article, by the advice of the ſenate, having effectually retarded the final ratification of the treaty, the ſame train of negociation which muſt be reſorted to, for the adjuſtment of that article, ſo as to be acceptable to the ſenate, may doubtleſs be recurred to for <hi>adjuſting other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectionable points.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No inconvenience, therefore, can reaſonably be apprehended from the <hi>non-ratification</hi> of the treaty in its preſent form. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been communicated to the people, the executive are now better able to form a judgment of the public mind, and to weigh objections which perhaps had not before occurred; and the people of the United States with confidence hope, that the <hi>preſident</hi> will not only attend to their reaſons, but pay reſpect to the <hi>general will of that people,</hi> whoſe affectionate confidence and authority he poſſeſſes on the preſent momentous occaſion. How far theſe remarks may accord with the <hi>general wiſhes</hi> and <hi>ſentiments</hi> of the people, it remains for <hi>him</hi> to determine.</p>
                  <p>When the conſtitution of the United States was adopted in <hi>Virginia,</hi> the convention, among the other amendments, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, "That no commercial treaty ſhall be ratified without the concurrence of two-thirds of the whole number of the members of the ſenate; and no treaty, <hi>ceding,</hi> contracting, or ſuſpending the <hi>territorial rights</hi> or claims of the United States or any of them; or their or any of their rights or claims to ſithing in the American ſeas, or <hi>navigating</hi> the <hi>American rivers,</hi> ſhall be made, but in caſes of the moſt urgent and extreme neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; nor ſhall any <hi>ſuch treaty</hi> be <hi>ratified without the concurrence of

<pb n="312" facs="unknown:028389_0888_0FD8BF371CDD4070"/>effected, which, of itſelf, is all-important; and that very conſiderable additional good has alſo been acquired by the ſurrender of the weſtern poſts, which leads to the termination of Indian warfare, and compenſation for the ſpoliations on our commerce.</p>
