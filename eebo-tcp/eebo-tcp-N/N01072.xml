            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>The Lord our God be with us, as he was with our Fathers: let him not leave us, nor forſake us: That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and his Statutes, and his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which he Commanded our Fathers.</p>

            <p>THESE Words now read in your Chriſtian Audience, [<hi>Much Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, Reverend, and Beloved,</hi>] are a part of that Royal Bleſſing wherewith King <hi>Solomon</hi> bleſſed the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> after an Elaborate
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001279_0004_0FB204269D0C4780"/>
and Affectionate Prayer for them, at the Solemn Dedication of the Temple, which he had build and finiſhed for Gods Honour and Worſhip: Supplicating the Divine Preſence and Favour as the Fountain of all bleſſings, with the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Manifeſtation thereof in ſome ſpecial Acts of Grace and Mercy: that the God of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers would own them, and be with them ſtill; not leave or forſake them: and that He would manifeſt this, not only by giving them outward Proſperity, but bleſſing them with Spiritual Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings. Particularly, that as he had given them his Word and Statutes to teach and direct them in the way that they ſhould walk; ſo he would by his Holy Spirit Effectually incline and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage their hearts to Keep and Obey them.</p>
            <p>It is juſtly to be eſteemed the Higheſt Honour and Happineſs of a People, to have the <hi>Lord JEHOVAH</hi> for their God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144.15. <hi>David</hi> pronounces the <hi>People happy that were in ſuch a caſe,</hi> as is before deſcribed, when their Sons [which be the Strength, Safety and Hopes of a Nation] are as Flouriſhing <hi>Plants grown up in their Youth:</hi> Their Daughters [on whom the Hope of Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity depends] <hi>as Corner-Stones poliſht after the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of a Palace;</hi> Strong and Beautiful, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with all the Ornaments proper to their Sex: <hi>When their Garners are full, affording all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Stones, their Sheep bringing forth Thouſands and ten Thouſands, their Oxen ſtrong to Labour, no break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

in of the Enemy,</hi> nor going out againſt them, nor with them into Captivity, no Complaining in their Streets, no Out-Cry or Howling for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſad Tidings, Publick grievances or Calamities. Happy is the People enjoying ſuch Plenty and Peace, ſaith the Pſalmiſt: Yet immediately there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, not in way of Compariſon herewith, but Correction of himſelf, He cryes out, <hi>Yea Happy is the People whoſe God is the LORD.</hi> The former was a very Deſirable Eſtate in it ſelf, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively it is nothing. The true and chief Happineſs of <hi>Iſrael</hi> does not conſiſt in theſe things, which are common to others with us, but in this Peculiar Priviledge, That the true &amp; Bleſſed God is our God by Covenant, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Relation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nextly,</hi> In having his Laws, Statutes and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the Rule of our Life and Walk, with an Heart inclined to <hi>Obſerve</hi> and <hi>Keep</hi> them. This alſo was <hi>Iſraels</hi> peculiar Priviledge at firſt, To have the Revelation of Gods Mind and Will in his Word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19, 20. With which Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>Moſes</hi> the Servant of the Lord, by whom the Law was firſt given, urges the People to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.6, 7, 8. Hereupon the People generally Promiſe Obedience; <hi>All that the Lord our God ſhall ſpeak unto us by thee, We will hear &amp; do it.</hi> Which Proteſtation of theirs God himſelf takes notice of and accepts as to the Matter of it: commanding them for it ſo far, Saying to <hi>Moſes,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001279_0006_0FB2042D0F9303C8"/>
I have heard the Voice of the Words of this People, which they have ſpoken unto thee, and they have well ſaid all that they have ſpoken.</hi> But then, (after the manner of men) expreſſes an holy jealouſy or ſuſpicion of the Truth and Sincerity of their Profeſſion, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.28, 29. <hi>Oh that there were ſuch an Heart in them, thus to Fear me always, and Keep all my Commandments,</hi> &amp;c. It was queſtionable as to Man, tho' not as to God, whether there were ſuch a Principle of Obedience in them as was like to be laſting, or without which they would ſurely fail as to the performance.</p>
            <p>The Thing it ſelf was greatly to be wiſhed by them, and for them, from the great Advantages that would accrue unto them and their Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty therefrom: But who ſhall give them ſuch an Heart? (as the Hebrew Words may be rendred) Who but God himſelf can confer this Grace and Bleſſing on any People? If theſe Words were ſpoken by <hi>Moſes</hi> (as ſome think) they are his Option or Prayer to God for Iſrael: that as he had newly delivered to them the great things of his Law, and they had engaged to Obſerve and Do all, their Hearts might be rightly framed to ſuch an Obedience, as was required of them, and now promiſed by them. Who will give them ſuch an Heart, or who will give their Heart to be ſuch in them? Tis certain that God alone can do this; therefore it implies an Addreſs to Him for it. Now from the ſame ſence <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

it is, that <hi>Solomon</hi> makes this Requeſt, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces this Bleſſing in our Text. <hi>The Lord our God be with us, as he was with our Fathers, let him not leave us, nor forsake us: That He may incline our Hearts unto Him, to keep his Commandments,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The DOCTRINAL Concluſion hence is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the moſt Deſirable Bleſſing which can be asked or wiſhed for, and pronounced upon any People under Heaven [as a Fruit and Evidence of the Divine Preſence with, and Favour towards them] is, That the God of Heaven would incline their Hearts to Himſelf, to Walk in all his Ways, to Keep his Commandments, his Statutes and his Judgments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or more briefly thus,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Choiceſt Mercy which any People have to deſire for Themſelves and Poſterity, or that God has to beſtow upon them in this Life, is to make them a Religious, and an Obedient People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the ſumm of <hi>Solomons</hi> comprehenſive Bleſſing here, and it is indeed the comprehenſe of all Bleſſings. Thus bleſt was <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reign of his immediate Predeceſſor: The Heart of his Royal Father was fully inclined to the Lord, and to his Teſtimonies, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.22. concerning whom the Lord himſelf thus reſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001279_0008_0FB2141214040DD0"/>
and ſaid; <hi>I have found</hi> David <hi>the Son of</hi> Jeſſe, <hi>a man after mine own heart, who ſhall fulfil all my will,</hi> [that is in Governing his People.] This was the chief Qualification which God reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Choice of him to be King over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.7. Looking, not as man, to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Appearance, but judging by the Heart; Calling him from a mean Employment, to the higheſt Seat in the Government; <hi>from following the Ewes great with young, he brought him to feed</hi> Jacob <hi>his People, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>his Inheritance: So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart, and guided them by the skilfulneſs of his Hands.</hi> This is the Teſtimonial which God has left upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord for him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.72. Wherein are commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded two neceſſary Qualifications of a good Prince or Chief Ruler in <hi>David. Integrity,</hi> whereby he ſincerely ſought the Good and Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of his People, avoiding and abhorring thoſe; Counſels and Courſes which were contrary thereunto. <hi>Skilfulneſs,</hi> whereby he managed all Affairs of the Publick with ſingular Prudence: which is here aſcribed to his Hands, not as if ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in them, but becauſe acted and diſcovered by them, as appeared in all his Actions and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations. It is ſad with a People when their Chief Ruler wants either of theſe, <hi>Skilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> or <hi>Faithfulneſs;</hi> and 'tis hard to ſay which of theſe can be worſt ſpared. King <hi>David</hi> was eminently accompliſhed with both, and the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001279_0009_0FB214165FE75FA8"/>

               <p>
                  <hi>That Gods Preſence and Favour, or His Favourable Preſence? is the ſupream Cauſe, Original, Author, Spring and Fountain of all Bleſſings</hi> (to a Perſon or People) <hi>Temporal, Spiritual and Eternal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a threefold Preſence of God menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the Scripture. As,</p>
               <p n="1">I. God is Naturally and <hi>Eſſentially Preſent</hi> with all his Creatures. He is an Immenſe Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and no Creature poſſibly could Act, Subſiſt or Be without him. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> argued in the Court of <hi>Athens,</hi> Act. 17.27, 28. <hi>God is not far from every one of us, for in him we live, move and have our being.</hi> He is near us all, he is with us all. Thus the Gentiles owned, and one of their Poets ſaid, <hi>Jovis omnia plena.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. God is <hi>Gloriouſly Preſent</hi> with the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Third Heavens. The Heaven of Heavens has in it moſt marvellous manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God. There the Bleſſed Ones have God ſo with them, as always to behold his Face: As Hell is ſet forth by a ſeparation from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord, <hi>&amp; from the Glory of his Power,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.9 So Heaven, <hi>by a Dwelling with him,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4 17. For as there the Saints are ever with the Lord, ſo the Lord is with them for ever.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God is <hi>Graciouſly Preſent</hi> with his People
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001279_0011_0FB2141994046B90"/>
here, by being favourable, kind and good unto them; <hi>Externally,</hi> in the ways of his Special Providence: <hi>Internally,</hi> by ſpecial Influences, Gifts, Motions and Operations of Grace. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, there is a common Providence of God, which Coextends it ſelf as far as the Creation; whereby he Upholds the things which he has made, and Governs them all to their deſigned end: In reſpect whereof, God is equally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with all perſons and people, good &amp; bad. But this ſpecial Preſence of God, he affords on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his Redeemed, Choſen and Called, who are not only under the Government of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, but the Dominion of Grace, and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Spirit. This is that Gracious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God which we ought to be ſolicitous for, and concerned to get and keep the abiding ſence and tokens thereof.</p>
               <p>It conſiſts, (I ſay) <hi>Firſt,</hi> In the Engagement of Divine Providence for our Welfare: Or, God is with us, when he is for us. To particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larize, Gods favourable Preſence with any Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is manifeſt in theſe Effects.</p>
               <p n="1">(I.) In giving them Conduct and Direction in the way that they ſhould walk. Every man has a Way to walk in, either Private or Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; In both which he needs a Counſellor and Guide, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.23. <hi>The way of man is not in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, neither is it in men that walketh, to direct his own ſteps.</hi> Thro' the darkneſs of the Way, and

ſhort-ſightedneſs of the Underſtanding, man is ever in danger of being bewildered &amp; loſt if left to himſelf. He cannot rightly enter upon, much leſs proceed and proſper in his way, that wants a true light. Now this light flows from the Preſence of the Lord: as <hi>David</hi> acknowledges upon experience, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.27. <hi>It is the Lord that ſheweth me light.</hi> Hence <hi>Solomon</hi> gave this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and counſel to man in general, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.5, 6. <hi>Truſt in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not to thine own underſtanding; in all thy ways acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him, and he will direct thy paths.</hi> Thoſe that make their own boſome their Oracle, God is diſengaged from being their Guide; they need him not: but the ſnares they run into will ſoon ſhew them how much they need him. Yea, not only our own reaſon, but the counſel and example of others will eaſily miſguide us; whereas the more men depend on God, the more he will undertake to teach and lead them. This is eſpecially neceſſary for a man in publick Place; more eſpecially if he Sit as Chief in the Land, Country or Province, and be to Chooſe out the Peoples Way for them, as well as his own. From an high ſence hereof, <hi>Moſes</hi> the Servant of the Lord being called to take the Conduct of his People <hi>Iſrael,</hi> &amp; lead them from <hi>Egypt</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> makes his Addreſs to God for this inſtance of his Grace and Favour, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.13. <hi>If I have found grace in thy ſight, ſhew me now
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001279_0013_0FB2141F3922C520"/>
thy Way: For wherein ſhall it be known that I and thy People have found grace in thy ſight, Is it not in this, that thou goeſt with us?</hi> Gods Servants and People are often brought into a Wilderneſs of Difficulties and Emergencies; but if God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf be with them, he guides them to a good iſſue of them all. And thus his Gracious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence appears in directing and inclining them to ſuch a courſe of actions, and method of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging Affairs, as makes for his Honour, and their own Safety.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) In affording them Protection againſt all threatning Evils or Dangers. As he guides them with his Eye, ſo he guards them with his Arm. Such as have the Almighty Jehovah with them, need not fear who is or can be againſt them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.31. Gods Preſence is a <hi>Defence</hi> to his Servants, and an <hi>Offence</hi> to their Enemies, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.15. <hi>Behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goeſt,</hi> ſaith the Lord to <hi>Jacob;</hi> and ſo to <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 7.9. <hi>I was with thee, and have cut off all thine Enemies.</hi> The Secrecy of his Preſence is the Saints Pavilion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4, <hi>laſt.</hi> Herein they may lye down in peace, and reſt ſecurely, becauſe the Keeper of <hi>Iſrael</hi> watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es over them day and night, that nothing hurt them. Yea if God be with them, <hi>they may paſs through the Fire, and not be burned, through the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and not be drowned,</hi> Iſa. 43.2.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) In granting Aſſiſtance and ſucceſs in
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001279_0014_0FB214205663FAB8"/>
their Affairs. To proſper in our Way requires Strength as well as Light. Not only do our Underſtandings want illumination, but our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive Powers help or aſſiſtance from God, to perform what is incumbent on their part: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this the Wiſeſt of men wont be able to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh what they undertake. But if God be preſent, he girdeth his Servants with Strength to perform their Work, ſo maketh their Way per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Yea do we not Read, <hi>That out of the Mouth of Babes &amp; Sucklings God has Ordained Strength and Praiſe,</hi> Pſal. 8.2. That is, Has ſetled a firm Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for his own Honour in Accompliſhing great things by weak and fooliſh inſtruments. As in Spiritual Matters, or in Working out our Souls Salvation, We have an entire Dependance on Him, <hi>Who worketh in us both to Will and to Do of his good pleaſure, Phil.</hi> 2.12, 13. So in all Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Affairs, we depend on the ſame Power and Goodneſs. What thro' Weakneſs or Wilfulneſs, the impotence of Mans Mind, or Diſorder of his Paſſions, and what thro' the difficult circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that attend his Affairs in this World of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability, Nothing can be done to purpoſe, unleſs God be his Preſent Help. In a word, There is no part of the Work &amp; Buſineſs that Providence calls us to, either in our General or Particular Callings, but what is above, or beyond our ſingle Strength: But if God be with us, his Grace ſhall be ſufficient to carry thro' the moſt Arduous and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001279_0015_0FB21421D1F70F60"/>
Hazardous Enterprizes in the World, and that with good Succeſs. The Almighty God thinks it enough to ſay to any Servant of his whom he calls to the moſt difficult Adventures, <hi>Certainly, I will be with thee.</hi> As when <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſent to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver <hi>Iſrael</hi> from their <hi>Egyptian</hi> Servitude, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.11, 12. <hi>Moſes ſaid to God, Who am I, that I ſhould go unto Pharaoh, and that I ſhould bring forth the Children of Iſrael out of Egypt? And God ſaid, Certainly, I will be with thee.</hi> The like was promiſed to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> whom the Lord appointed to Succeed <hi>Moſes</hi> as Captain General to lead the Hoſt into <hi>Canaan, Joſh.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Be ſtrong and of a good Courage, for as I was with Moſes, ſo I will be with thee, I will not fail thee, nor forſake thee.</hi> All their Victories and Succeſſes were owing to this Supreme Cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> The Favourable Preſence of God with them, As is acknowledged, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.3. <hi>For they got not the Land into Poſſeſſion by their own Sword, neither did their own Arm ſave them; but thy Right Hand and thine Arm, and the light of thy Countenance, becauſe thou hadſt a Favour unto them.</hi> True and Real Proſperity in every Undertaking, Buſineſs and Affair depends on this Preſence and Favour of God. The Beſt Humane Policy and Induſtry will fail without it. Holy <hi>David</hi> retiring off the Stage of this World left this Bleſſing with his Advice to <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 Chron. 22.11. <hi>And now my Son, The Lord be with thee, and Proſper thou.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are ſome of the more ordinary Benefits
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001279_0016_0FB2142734BFD090"/>
of Gods Providential Preſence with a Perſon or People in way of Favour to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> There are yet more ſpecial Fruits of his Spiritual Preſence in his Word and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Making them Effectual means of Enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Converting, Sanctifying and Comforting the Souls of men. But not to inſiſt on theſe here: I would only ſay, That all Spiritual Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings depend more abſolutely upon, and flow more immediately from the Preſence of the Lord. Having it helps men to Live Holily, and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to Dy Comfortably. If God be with us His Goodneſs ſhall lead us to Repentance, His Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection be for our Profit, in bringing us to partake of His Holineſs: and All his Diſpenſations work Spiritual Good in us and for us, as a pledge of and Preparatory to that which is Eternal. Yea, His Rod and His Staff Comfort the Saints both Living &amp; Dying. Whom the <hi>Shepherd</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> takes the Care of, he not only ſhews to them the Path of Life, but will certainly bring them thro' Death to Life. <hi>He leads by Counſil, till he receives to Glory, Pſal.</hi> 73.24. Making them full of Joy from his Countenance, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.28. Darting One Beam of light on their Way, Another of Joy on their Hearts, Both together rendring their walk thro' the darkeſt Valley of the Shadow of Death to be Safe, and Comfortable to them that have this Preſence of God with them, and the ſenſible Apprehenſion, or Experimental Feelings

thereof, as <hi>David</hi> had, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.4. This is the Life of our Life, yea, 'tis Life in Death, and Life after Death, even Eternal Life. Moreover, The Preſence of God makes Heaven: To have God with us is a Heaven upon Earth: and our Being with him is the Heaven of Heaven. To Dwell for ever with that Bleſſed God <hi>in whose Preſence is Fulneſs of Joy, and at whoſe right hand are pleasures evermore,</hi> Pſal. 16.11.</p>

               <p>The Sum of all Religion Natural and Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, may be lookt upon as Comprehended under theſe Expreſſions in our Text; and when the Heart of Man, (whereby the whole Soul is meant) Underſtanding, Will and Affections are ſo directed and inclined, as to make choice of God himſelf for their laſt End and chief Good, the Object of their Faith and Love, Reverence and Obedience; and his Word as the Rule of All, then may they be ſaid to be <hi>Religious.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:001279_0018_0FB2142C59FEB190"/>There are many Religions ſo called, as there are God's many, and Lord's many: but there being but One true God, there is and can be but One true Religion, which is his Revealed Will concerning our Service to him, and Communion with him. There is a Religion if there be a God, and but One Religion, if but One God, whoſe Will is Uniform. For our Help and Guidance herein, God has not only left us the Book of the Creature, wherein much of Himſelf and his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections may be read: But alſo has given us the Book of Scripture, inſpired by his own Spirit, wherein is the Revelation of his Mind &amp; Will; teaching us more perfectly what he would have us to Know and Believe of him, and how we ſhould live in Obedience to him. Here are the Decrees, the Statutes and Ordinances of the King of Heaven: Rules to guide us in our whole Courſe to our laſt End.</p>
               <p>God has put a certain Law into the Creatures, which we call the Law of Nature, in the due ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of which they attain their End, &amp; glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify God. As the <hi>Sun</hi> runs his Race like a Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, yet keeps his Track to an hairs breadth. But to <hi>Man</hi> who is a Voluntary Agent, God gives his Commands by his Word, and expects a Volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Obedience thereunto, as the Way to his own Honour, and our Good. Now our plenary and full Conformity or Subjection unto theſe in our whole Man, This is to be <hi>Religious,</hi> to be Godly,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001279_0019_0FB2142DD8276D08"/>
to live unto God: &amp; when it is ſo, God is with us of a Truth. This is a ſpecial Fruit and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it. The Truth in this Propoſition may be illuſtrated by a few Particulars. Briefly,</p>
               <p n="1">I. That it was Neceſſary, for God to preſcribe a Law unto us, Or, to give us his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, his Statutes and his Judgments. Whether we are conſidered <hi>Apart,</hi> or with Reſpect to <hi>Community.</hi> Conſidered <hi>Apart,</hi> As a Creature, Man is ſubject to the Direction of Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; but as a Reaſonable Creature, he is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Moral Government: This Law was at firſt Written on Man's Nature, and that was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient while he ſtood in his Integrity to guide him, and enable him to Serve and Pleaſe God in all things propounded to him. The Law Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on the Heart of Man was both his Principle and his Rule: but that being obliterated by the Fall, it becomes needful that God ſhould give a New Law to guide Man to his own Bleſſedneſs, and to keep him from Erring. Eſpecially if Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in a <hi>Community.</hi> All Societies of men from the beginning of the World have found the Eſtabliſhing of Laws the only Means to preſerve themſelves from Ruin; there is no other way to prevent Confuſion: and would God leave that Society which is of his own Inſtitution, and of which He is the Head, without Laws and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances? No ſurely, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.9. <hi>The Lords Portion is his People,</hi> therefore He will take ſpecial Care
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001279_0020_0FB2142F51FC6A78"/>
of them, and give unto them ſuch Statutes and Judgments, as may preſerve his own Authority &amp; Intereſt among them, according to which he will reckon with them hereafter: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.22. <hi>The Lord is our Law giver and our Judge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In thoſe Statutes and Commandments of the Law which God has given us, we have not only a Direction ſet before us, but an Obligation laid upon us. The Word of God is not only a Rule (for Information) but a Law (for Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.) 'Tis not only the Reſult of God's Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but the Effect of his Legiſlative Will; He would not only inſtruct us in our Duty, but oblige us to perform it, by the One ſhewing the Equity, by the Other the Neceſſity of our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. He has not left us at liberty to comply with his Counſels; but has left the Charge of his Commandments upon us.</p>
               <p>The Moral Obligation of the Law ſtill lies on thoſe that are taken under the Covenant of Grace. [There is an Eternal Obligation on the Creature to Love and Serve the Creator, which cannot be diſſolved:] We are not Redeemed from the <hi>Service</hi> of the Law by Chriſt, but the <hi>Curſe</hi> of the Law, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.74, 75. The End of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>tion was not to deſtroy our Service accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Law; but to fit and inable us to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it according to the Image of God renewed in us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.24. And becauſe our Law is broader, and takes in the Goſpel too (which is the Law
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001279_0021_0FB21434E9B640D0"/>
of Faith) We are bound to take care of all that God has given us in Charge, even all that is A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted into our Rule of Faith &amp; Repentance, as well as Moral Duties. <hi>Again,</hi> The Statutes and Commandments of the Law are immutably, and indiſpenſibly binding to All Men without Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. No Man beggeth Exemption here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his Condition, High or Low, Rich or Poor, Prince or Peaſant. God does not exempt any Creature from Duty to Him, but ſpeaks im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially to All. <hi>Hear O Kings, Give ear O Princes, Potentates and Rulers of the World, as well as Subjects and mean People.</hi> Yea, the higher men's Station the greater their Obligation in many Reſpects. God's Law is a Royal Law, His Statutes and His Judgments ſo Noble and Excellent in themſelves, that we need not be aſhamed to ſpeak of them before Kings, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.46. Or to Commend the Wayes of the Lord to the greateſt Perſonages in the World. <hi>But yet,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Hearts of All Men are naturally Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inclined to <hi>Obedience.</hi> Since the firſt man proved a Rebel againſt his Maker, All his Poſterity (by ordinary Generation) are become Children of Diſobedience: Are become naked and deſtitute of the Image of God, not only indiſpoſed but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to that which is good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. <hi>The carnal mind is Enmity againſt God, for it is not Subject to the Law of God, nor indeed can be:</hi> it cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it will not. Fallen man has neither Power
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001279_0022_0FB2143615F5F6A8"/>
nor Will to Obey God. There is both Weakneſs and Wilfulneſs in Humane Nature, that it is not ſubject to the Divine Will: I mean not Created but Corrupted Nature, <hi>qua talis,</hi> as ſuch it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reconciled to God, or perfectly ſubject to his Law. It may be as to the outward mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial part, but not as to the Spiritual and true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment of it, till it be renewed. There muſt be a change of Nature to bring Sinful Man into a State of Reconciliation and Friendſhip with God, and to Walk in Ways of Obedience unto him, and his Commandments, not only becauſe injoined, but inclined, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.3.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This is God's Work: or tis He alone can change the Hearts of Men, turn them from their natural Bent and Byaſs to the World &amp; Sin, and incline them to Himſelf and his Ways, Remove the Averſion and Prejudice of the Old Corrupt Mind &amp; Will, Create new light and likeing in the Soul, new Principles, Diſpoſitions, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. This is an Effect of Almighty Power and Soveraign Grace: of Enemies &amp; Rebels to make Willing Obedient Subjects to the Lord. Its called, <hi>A Day of his Glorious and Gracious Power, Pſal.</hi> 110.3. When the Heart of Man does Surrender, <hi>and the Everlaſting Doors are ſet open to the King of Glory,</hi> and All the Powers within offer themſelves as Voluntiers, or Voluntarineſſes in his Service.</p>
               <p>This is not brought about by Moral perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons meerly, much leſs by Coaction or Violence;
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001279_0023_0FB21437923ECAA8"/>
but Efficacious Working of the Spirit of Grace, in a manner ſuitable to the Nature and Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Will, which is not deſtroyed, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by Grace. <hi>Now,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. This is a Signal Manifeſtation of the ſpecial Preſence of God with any Perſon or People, when he does thus incline their Hearts unto Himſelf, and his Ways. Or, A general Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to an Obediential Walking with God in the way of his Commandments is a good Argument that God is and will be graciouſly Preſent with ſuch a People, and walk in Ways of Mercy and Loving kindneſs towards them: or in a word, to Bleſs &amp; Proſper them. <hi>Converſion</hi> &amp; <hi>Reformation</hi> are Effects and ſo Real Evidences of the Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Grace, (as the Cauſe is argued by the Effect:) Indeed <hi>Repentance</hi> &amp; <hi>New-Obedience</hi> are put into the Precept as Conditions of God's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Bleſſing: and tis certain, that God will be with us, but as we are with him, and walk in his Ways. What more evident then this from the Promiſe and Threatning Conjunct, declared by a Prophet of the Lord before the chief Ruler and People together, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.2. <hi>Hear ye me</hi> Aſa <hi>and all</hi> Judah <hi>and</hi> Benjamin, <hi>The Lord is with you while ye be with him, and if ye ſeek him he will be found of you,</hi> — Yet not as if our ſeeking God were firſt, or our walking in Ways of Obedience muſt neceſſarily precede as a procuring cauſe of his Bleſſing. Alas, ſo Fooliſh &amp; Wicked is Fallen

Man, that if God ſhould not begin with him, he would never begin with God. Men are ſo Dead in Treſpaſſes &amp; Sins they cannot, ſo habituated and inclined to Evil, that they will not return to God &amp; his Ways, till he is afore-hand with them. If therefore <hi>Religion</hi> be Propagated, or <hi>Reformation</hi> brought on in the World, or any part thereof lying in Wickedneſs, <hi>God is found of thoſe that ſeek him not:</hi> our ſeeking him is a Fruit of his firſt ſeeking us: and when the Hearts of a People are ſet to Serve and Obey him by keeping his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>&amp;c.</hi> its an evidence that He both is and will be with them. When the Body of a People, eſpecially a conſiderable Part of the Riſing Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration in any Place, are diſpoſed to be Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and Religious, its a manifeſt Token of Gods abiding Preſence there. If a Peoples walking with God, Keeping cloſe to his Word and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, be a means to retain his Favourable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence among them, then the inclining of their Childrens Hearts thereunto, is the moſt encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging Token that he intends to take up his Abode in ſuch a Place; It ſpeaks well concerning them for a long time to come. <hi>That the God of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will not leave or forſake them.</hi> On the other Hand, There is not a more Awful Token of Gods Departure from a Land, or leaving a People quite, then when their Children are Corrupt, and a Degenerate Offspring, that regard not their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers God, nor have any Heart to his Covenant

and Ways. Paſs we now to the Third Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which follows as an Inference from the two former. <hi>Viz.</hi>

               <head>PROPOSITION III.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the moſt Deſirable Bleſſing which can be asked or wiſhed for, and pronounced upon any People under Heaven (as a Fruit and Evidence of the Divine Preſence with, and Favour towards them) is, that the God of Heaven would incline their Hearts, and the Hearts of their Children to Himſelf, to Walk in his Ways, to Keep his Commandments, his Statutes, and his Judgments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As it is the cleareſt and ſureſt Evidence of Gods Preſence, ſo it is the choiceſt and beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his Favour. Tis an eminent Fruit of Election, and actual Fulfilling of the Covenant of Grace: <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. They that find the Law written in their Hearts, may conclude their Names are written in Heaven, and that they are ſome of Gods peculiar Favourites. Outward Proſperity is no ſign of ſpecial Favour. Indeed, tis no certain ſign at all that God is with a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Way of Favour, meerly becauſe he makes them Proſperous in Outward things, giveth them Power to get Wealth, and heap up Riches or Earthly Treaſure in Abundance, Suffereth to live at Eaſe &amp; Enjoy temporal Felicity; There may
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001279_0026_0FB2143F345385E8"/>
be a Woe belonging to them, and coming upon them for all this. But when he inclines them to be <hi>Religious,</hi> directs them in his ways, gives Power and Will to Obey him in all things. This argues not only a Providential, but Spiritual Preſence of God with ſuch a People. Tis an infallible Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his ſpecial love and good will towards them. For, As the inclination of the Heart is neceſſary to Obedience, ſo is Hearty Obedience unto Happineſs, Temporal &amp; Eternal. Not only the Heart, but an inclined Heart is neceſſary to true and acceptable Obedience to God. The Heart muſt be framed and ſet Godward, or it will be impoſſible to yield a cheerful, uniform &amp; conſtant Obedience to him: But that being once well inclined twill influence and draw the whole Man after it; For the Heart is the Spring of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that ſets all the wheels a working: If God has that, he will have all. Thus the New Heart proves the greateſt Bleſſing of the New Covenant, as a Fruit of Grace and Fountain of Obedience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moreover,</hi> Thus to Obey God from the Heart, is the only way to pleaſe him, and what ſurer way to proſper in every thing, ſince that wholly depends on his good will and pleaſure. The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of Gods Laws, Counſels &amp; Commands as the Rules of our living, is undoubtedly the way to live well and fare well in this World and the next. Hence, All the Remaining Proof of the Doctrine, may be had from Conſideration of the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001279_0027_0FB214409C804B90"/>
manifold great Advantages and Benefits of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God, in a Religious Obſervance of his holy Laws and Commands, with the manifold great Miſchiefs &amp; Miſeries of the contrary courſe conſidered as we go along.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> If we conſider Man ſingly and in a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Capacity, The Religious Obſervance of Gods Laws and Commandments, conduces much to the Happineſs of every One, even in this Life, &amp; that both as to the Inward and Outward Man: In the light and enlargment of their Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Peace of their Minds and Conſciences, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Health, Honour, and Eſtate. The contrary tends as much to their Hurt in all theſe. How much it concerns Private Perſons to be Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Obedient, The Wiſe Preacher has told us in a Word; when he ſays, <hi>Tis the whole of Man, Eccl.</hi> 12.13. This is as much a Truth now as it was then, that to fear God and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments is the All, the whole of Man; The whole of his Duty and the whole of his Felicity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Laws, Statutes and Judgments of God are wonderfully fitted for the benefit of Humane Society: And the obſervance of them every way neceſſary and advantagious to the Publick Happineſs and Proſperity of Nations, as well as of private Perſons.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The Matter of theſe Commandments reſpects either Law or Goſpel. That which is ſtrictly
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001279_0028_0FB21445D82BB6B0"/>
called the Moral Law or Decalogue is a fit Rule for a wiſe God to give, and a Rational Creature to receive: A juſt Admeaſurement of our Duty to God and man. The World cannot be without it. To God, that we ſhould love Him, ſerve Him, depend upon Him, and delight in Him, worſhiping of Him at the Time, in the ways and manner appointed by Himſelf. To Man, <hi>Juſtice and Charity, or Mercy,</hi> Mic. 6.8. In the Goſpel, we have likewiſe, this excellent A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment of our duty by the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> Tit. 2.12. Which teaches, <hi>That denying Ungodlineſs &amp; World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Luſts, we ſhould live Soberly, Righteouſly and Godly in this preſent World.</hi> Now, both the moral and Evangelical Precepts of Gods Word are ſuited to promote the Publick intereſt of Nations as well as the Private intereſt of ſingle Perſons. This would moſt evidently appear by a Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the contrary. Suppoſe a Reverſe of all that God has commanded concerning the imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of Virtue &amp; Shunning of Vice: if he ſhould free men from thoſe Laws which himſelf has moſt Solemnly Enacted, leave them to their own choice: or ſuppoſe Eſtabliſh the contrary, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid us all Reſpect to himſelf, Commanding us to Worſhip falſe Gods, Transform, and miſrepreſent his Glory by Images, Fall down before Stocks &amp; Stones, Blaſpheme his Name continually, and Deſpiſe all thoſe glorious Attributes which do ſo clearly ſhine forth in the Creation; If he had
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:001279_0029_0FB2144761417168"/>
Commanded us to be impious to our Parents, to fill the World with Murders, Adulteries, Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to purſue others with Slanders and falſe Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, to court and take away what is another mans, Wife, Ox, or Aſs, Houſe or Land, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant or Child, ſurely the Heart of Man cannot allow ſuch a Conceit. Nay the fierceſt Beaſts would abhor it if capable of ſuch an impreſſion; If Luſts and Intemperance, Fraud, Rapine, and Violence were enjoyned or but Tolerated, what a World would it ſoon be? Humane Societies would preſently fly in pieces, and all Mankind neceſſarily fall into a ſtate of War and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; But now our Wiſe and Good God has taken care to prevent theſe miſchievous evils to Men, by interdicting all manner of Sin and Vice on the ſevereſt Penalty, Eſtabliſhing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary practice of Piety &amp; Virtue by a Law. Yea all things required herein, are at leaſt, materially fitted for the good of Humane Societies.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The actual Obſervance of theſe good Laws, Statutes &amp; Commands, is both neceſſary &amp; effectual to the Publick Welfare of Mankind. Tis not enough to have them and know them; but tis the doing of Gods will therein which makes bleſſed. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Nations or Societies of People, as well as Happy Souls of particular Perſons. The Decrees and Ordinances of Heaven were made and Publiſhed for this end to be obſerved; not only
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:001279_0030_0FB214490B952238"/>
to be heard and contemplated but reduced unto Practice. And tis practical Obedience which makes way for the Bleſſing of Heaven to any perſons or people upon Earth.</p>
               <p n="1">I. This is Neceſſary. And that both <hi>Ex Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate Praecepti, &amp; Medji.</hi> (I) <hi>Praecepti,</hi> God has ſtrictly charged the people whom he has favoured with his word, that they diligently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and do all things which he has Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and abſtain from whatſoever he has forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.1. (2) <hi>Medij,</hi> as a means to Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. National as well as Perſonal, Prov. 14.34. <hi>Righteouſneſs Exalteth a Nation: But ſin is the Reproach of any People.</hi> Righteouſneſs taken in the Latitude of it, for the whole of Religion (as ſometimes in <hi>Scripture</hi> it is) comprehending all Divine Humane &amp; Social Virtues, has a natural tendency to promote Publick Happineſs. On the contrary, Sin and Wickedneſs does in its own Nature produce many Publick miſchiefs &amp; miſeries. But this will be further ſhown under the other branch of the particular.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a certain Efficacy as well as Neceſſity of walking in ways of Obedience to Gods holy Laws &amp; Commands. Theſe are propounded in form of a Covenant, to which promiſes and threatnings are annexed: That it ſhall go well or ill with a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple according as they Obſerve or Neglect theſe. It is a Doctrine not long ſince commended to us from this <hi>Desk</hi> on like Occaſion. <hi>That ſuch Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:001279_0031_0FB2144B120845A0"/>
and Places as profeſs Chriſtian Religion, may expect to be Happy or Miſerable according as it goes with them as to Holineſs and Righteouſneſs.</hi> That is, As to the obſervance of the Duties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Firſt or Second Table of Gods Law, or their Neglect of them. Thus it fared with the Nation and Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whilſt they were with God in the ways of Duty, God was wont to be with them in the ways of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to bleſs and proſper them. But when they forſook God, and walkt contrary to him, his way was to forſake and walk contrary to them: when it was their Way to grieve him with their impieties and iniquities, it was his Way to vex them with Various adverſities. This the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture declares to be the ſettled courſe of Gods Providence, that a Righteous Nation ſhall be happy, &amp; that a Wicked People ſhall be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed even in this Life. The experience of all Ages has made it good. All along the Hiſtory of the Old Teſtament, we find the interchangeable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences of God towards the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſuited to their manners. <hi>which things hapned to them for enſamples, and are recorded for our inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on whom the Ends of the World are come,</hi> 1. Cor. 10.11. And tho' God in the Adminiſtrations of his juſtice be not tied up to Precedents, nor can we argue from Scripture examples that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences of God towards other Nations, ſhall in all Circumſtances be conformable to his dealings
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001279_0032_0FB2144EEEECD528"/>
with the <hi>Jews:</hi> yet thus much may with great Probability be collected from them, that as He always bleſſed that People while they were obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to him, &amp; followed them with Judgments when they rebelled againſt him, ſo he will alſo deal with other Nations, Becauſe the reaſon of thoſe Diſpenſations as to the main and ſubſtance of them ſeems to be Perpetual and founded in that which can never change. <hi>viz.</hi> The invariable juſtice of the Divine Providence. Indeed as to particular Perſons, the Providences of God are Promiſcuouſly adminiſtred in this World. So that no man can certainly conclude His love or hatred by any thing that befals him in this life. But God does not deal thus with Nations, becauſe (as a late Learned <hi>PRIMATE</hi> of our Nation obſerves) <q>Publick Bodies &amp; Communities of men as ſuch can only be rewarded &amp; puniſhed in this World; for in the Next, all thoſe Societies &amp; combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions wherein Men are now linkt together un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their ſeveral Governments ſhall be diſſolved.</q> God will not reward or Puniſh Nations then as Nations, but every Man ſhall give an Account of himſelf to God, and receive his own Reward, or bear his own Burden: But this being the only Seaſon for National Rewards and Puniſhments, it ſeemeth Reaſonable and neceſſary in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, for a preſent Vindication of the Honour and Majeſty of the Divine Laws, that a People ſhould be proſperous or afflicted, according as
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001279_0033_0FB21450891009B0"/>
their general Obedience or Diſobedience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to appears.</p>
               <p n="3">III. A Cordial reſpect; to God &amp; his Ways; that is, <hi>Godlineſs</hi> or true <hi>Religion</hi> in the Heart not only Obliges but Diſpoſes all ſorts of Perſons to an actual Obſervance of all ſuch things, as tend to the Publick Intereſt and Happineſs of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities which they belong unto, or to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious diſcharge of the Duties belonging to them in their ſeveral Places &amp; Relations. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>the Fear of God (which is the beginning of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> the Principle of all Religion) is truly Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that certainly lays the greateſt Obligation on Conſcience to all Civil Offices and Moral Duties: and likewiſe will have the greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on the whole Behaviour of Men one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another, as well as towards GOD himſelf</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Particularly,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. Tis of great uſe in the Government of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Societies, by its influence both on Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours and Governed; Cauſing the One to Rule well, and the other to Obey for Conſcience ſake. This Diſtinction of Men is of Divine Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. <hi>The Powers that be are Ordained of God.</hi> The Teſtimonies of the Lord preſcribe the Duty of both. (I.) Of Governours or Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, 2 <hi>Sam. 23.3. He that Ruleth over men muſt be juſt, Ruling in the fear God,</hi> Where is a Word belonging to either Table, <hi>Fear</hi> of God in the firſt; and <hi>Juſtice</hi> in the ſecond. The one influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial

to the other. Hence <hi>Joſeph</hi> aſſured his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, he ſhould be juſt to them on this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>For I Fear God, Gen.</hi> 42.18. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did not imbeazle or convert the Publick Treaſures to his private uſe (as ſome other Governours had done before,) <hi>Neh.</hi> 5.15 <hi>But ſo did not I, becauſe of the Fear of God.</hi> Yea this Principle ſetled in the Heart not only preſerves from any Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt God, and Unrighteouſneſs againſt Men; but promotes all acts of Love &amp; Charity towards Men, as well as Piety and Devotion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God. (2.) For the Governed. The Word of God interpoſeth expreſs Rules for their Obedience, and true reſpect to God not only <hi>Obliges</hi> but <hi>Diſpoſeth</hi> to obſerve them. And alſo to <hi>Submit to every Ordinance of Man for the Lords ſake; whether it be to the King as Supreme, or unto Governours as thoſe that are ſent by him: For ſo is the Will of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.15. There are many Arguments why we ſhould Reverence &amp; Obey Magiſtrates, but the Supreme reaſon is, <hi>The Will of God.</hi> The chief Ruler was then an Enemy to Religion when this Commandment was given forth, even then when that part of the World, in which the Church was Seated, was under the Command of <hi>Nero,</hi> whoſe univerſal Wickedneſs and particular cruelty againſt the Chriſtians might provoke them to diſobedience; yet then, God ſaid, <hi>Obey</hi> and that not for <hi>Wrath,</hi> or fear of the Rulers Power only, which is but a looſe
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:001279_0035_0FB21457141CC208"/>
Principle of Obedience, and will ceaſe when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver men can Rebel with ſafety and to advantage; But out of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> which is a firm, conſtant &amp; laſting Principle, that will hold man faſt, when all other obligations will break. A true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is not to be tempted from his Obedience and Subjection by any Worldly conſiderations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he believes, <hi>That whoſoever reſiſteth Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty reſiſteth the Ordinance of God, and that they who reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves Damnation,</hi> Rom. 13.2.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Religion</hi> or <hi>Godlineſs</hi> is the beſt Friend to Government, and when Governours &amp; Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are Faithful in obſerving and diſcharging their reſpective Duties, it is a conſiderable Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that God is with ſuch a People in a Way of Favour: <hi>That they ſhall live long in the Land which he has given them, &amp; be proſperous,</hi> Exod. 20.12.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It tends to promote the Publick Happineſs and Welfare, as it obliges and diſpoſes Men care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully &amp; conſcienciouſly to obſerve all the Rules of Civil Converſation, Society and Commerce together. To keep Truth inviolably in all their Words, Promiſes, and Contracts; To be juſt &amp; honeſt in all their Dealings one with another; Peaceable &amp; Loving one towards another: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding all Strife &amp; Contention, Seeking to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance each others intereſt as their own, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the Publick to a Private.

The Glory of all which as it is only owing, ſo ought to be aſcribed to the Riches of Divine Grace and Goodneſs; that notwithſtanding the great Decay of Piety, and Defect of good Manners among us, to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, Bewailed, and Mourned over: God has not left <hi>New-England</hi> (as in just judgment he

might) to a general Violation of his Covenant, or Apoſtacy from his Ways. And tho' he has viſited our Tranſgreſſion of his Laws with a Rod, and our Iniquity with Stripes, yet we trust he has not taken away his Loving kindneſs from us, nor will ſuffer his Faithfulneſs to fail towards us. There is yet much of his Spiritual Preſence and influences of Grace afforded to ſome in every Order, Rank and Quality, both in Church and State. And likewiſe the Favourable Providence of God in many Publick inſtances thereof has been, and is yet extended to the Country in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; which calls for Publick and general Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments. As the Health, Plenty &amp; Quiet of this laſt year in the Land; Freedom from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidemical Diſeaſes, Pinching Neceſſities, &amp; Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of barbarous Eenemies. The continuance of our Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Liberties, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of other Mercies and Bleſſings. It is true our Civil Liberties and Priviledges are not juſt the ſame that ſometimes they have been; yet it is better with us on that Account than we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and than others no worſe deſerving than our ſelves Enjoy. Our Church State is the ſame as at firſt. We have never been interrupted, not impoſed upon as to Doctrine, Worship, or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline. Indeed our Uneaſineſs and Diſcontent under the beſt Civil Government is the likelieſt means to procure a Change for the worſe. Our Unthankfulneſs for, and Unfruitfulneſs under
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:001279_0049_0FB2147BD1E1FCD8"/>
Goſpel Priviledges (ſo highly valued in our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers days,) do threaten us more than anything with the loſs thereof, or with a <hi>Curſe</hi> inſtead of a <hi>Bleſſing:</hi> Which calls to ſee and conſider,</p>
               <p n="2">II. What cauſe of <hi>Grief</hi> and <hi>Mourning</hi> on this Account, or for Want of this moſt deſireable and comfortable Fruit &amp; Evidence of Gods Preſence &amp; Favour. Is it not to be Confeſſed &amp; Lamented that God is not ſo with us, as he was with our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? And are there not too many fearful Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of his further withdrawing, if not utterly leaving us? Among which <hi>this</hi> is none of the leaſt, That He ſeems to looſen the Reins of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and leave men to themſelves, their own Counſels and Ways: when inſtead of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Grace to incline them to all manner of Obedience, they have not ſo much as Reſtraining Grace to prevent any Sin and Wickedneſs, they have a mind to. Nay does not the Bent &amp; Byas of this Generation ſeem to be much Set, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, his Statutes, Ordinances and Ways, but ſome to one Vanity or way of Wickedneſs, and ſome to another, according to their different Conſtitutions, or Inclinations of corrupted Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Cuſtoms, Companions, and Temptations; ſo that there is ſcarce any ſort of impiety and i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquity but may be ſeen to Be and Abound in the midſt of us. Now what greater cauſe of <hi>Sorrow</hi> and <hi>Lamentation!</hi> If meer Unregeneracy, or want of an Hearty inclination to God &amp; God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:001279_0048_0FB214779A0623D0"/>
be ſo Lamentable a State, how much worſe is it, when the Hearts of the Children of men are fully let in them to do Wickedly! The more common this is in any Place, the more cauſe of Mourning.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The Doctrine calls upon us to do all we can in our ſeveral Stations and Capacities, to Retain what of this Bleſſing is Enjoyed, and to Obtain what is wanting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> It earneſtly calls on thoſe that are now the Fathers of the Country, <hi>Political</hi> and <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> Fathers, to engage their Hearts in this Work. Both the Temporal and Spiritual Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and Proſperity of theſe their Children and People muſt needs lie very near the Hearts of all ſuch: Both Nature and Grace obliges ſuch to the utmoſt expreſſion of an affectionate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for them, and exerciſe of their Paternal Care for their good on every account.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Our <hi>Political Fathers</hi> in the Commonwealth are hereby called upon, to do their utmoſt to engage the Preſence of God with themſelves &amp; us, to maintain the honour of Religion, and promote the Obſervance of all his Laws, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and Judgments among us, by their Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Authority; as knowing how much their own and the Publick Happineſs depends there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> as men, are equally concerned with others to have reſpect to all Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; for they ſtand on the ſame level
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:001279_0047_0FB21475F09DA9D8"/>
before him who has no reſpect of Perſons in Commanding, Judging or Rewarding, <hi>Job</hi> 34.19. As men, they are as much concerned to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the way of Pleaſing, Glorifying &amp; En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying God, as their meaneſt Subjects: Yea, the higher their Station, the greater their obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, even as men, 2 <hi>San.</hi> 12.7, 8, 9. As Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates and Rulers, they have great need to be acquainted with Gods Teſtimonies, that they may underſtand their Place and Duty, that they may be caried thro' their cares, fears &amp; snares; that they may have ſucceſs, &amp; find acceptance. The way for ſuch to Rule wiſely and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, is in all their Government and Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, to have reſpect to Gods Word, and keep cloſe to that. This counſel and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement the Lord himſelf gives to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> Joſh. 1.8. <hi>The Book of the Law ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou ſhalt meditate thereon day and night, that thou mayſt obſerve to do according to all that is written therein; For then ſhalt thou make thy way proſperous, and thou ſhalt then have good ſucceſs.</hi> So <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 King. 2.3. Thus ſelf intereſt obliges Rulers as well as others to be Religious, and Obſervant of Gods Commands themſelves; But Duty obliges further, <hi>viz.</hi> to conſult the good of the People under them.</p>
               <p n="1">(I.) By being thus good Examples to them, both of Piety and Morality, or of all holy and vertuous carriages; this will have a mighty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence to draw others to the like practice.</p>
               <p n="2">

By exerciſing their Authority; who are firſt Gods Subjects, then his Officers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4. <hi>Miniſters of God for good to the people.</hi> Much good may a Godly Magiſtracy do to promote the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious intereſt of a people, as well as thoſe of a civil and ſecular nature and concern. By de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending and maintaining their Spiritual Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, ſpeaking comfortably to thoſe that teach the good Knowledge of the Lord (as good <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> did) and providing ſuitable encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for thoſe that attend the Service of Gods Houſe. Alſo by Reſtraining, Suppreſſing and Puniſhing the Tranſgreſſors of his Law. Tho' the hearts of men are not in the hands of theſe Earthly Gods (as the Scripture ſtyles Magiſtrates) nor can they change their natural inclinations and wills; yet may do a great ſervice by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting their manners and ways. And External Obedience or Conformity to Gods Law, is much better than none, eſpecially as to the Publick. Tho' Hypocriſy is a great wickedneſs; and in ſome ſenſe it is a truth, That <hi>Simulata ſanctites eſt duplex iniquitas:</hi> Diſſembled Holineſs is a double wickedneſs: Be ſure, it is very odious to God, yet not of ſo pernicious example to the World, as open Prophaneſs and Diſobedience. Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy (as one ſays) ſhows ſome Reverence to Religion and the Ways of God, does ſo far ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the excellency hereof, as to own it deſerves to be counterfeited; whereas Propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

and Immorality declare openly againſt it, and endeavour to make a Party to drive it out of the Land and World. Indeed, 'tis a matter of great difficulty to Reduce a Degenerate Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to bring them generally to outward Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; yet that is the leaſt which is neceſſary to ſave them from Publick Ruine, and the leaſt that Pious Rulers will deſign and endeavour to accompliſh. If ſuch would heartily join to do all they can, by their Laws &amp; Examples, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they would prevail much; and if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not effect all they would, God will take it well, that it was in their hearts, and likewiſe Reward their Endeavours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May it therefore Pleaſe Your <hi>Excellency!</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>The God of <hi>New-England,</hi> [Our Fathers God and Ours] We truſt had a Kindneſs and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour for us, as well as Delight in You, SIR, When by His Providence he called Home, and Exalted a Perſon of ſuch ſingular Worth, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodneſs to the Place of Chief Rule and Government over us. Our Obſervation &amp; Experience of the Good Hand of the Lord which has been with You hitherto, Protecting, Direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Aſſiſting and Succeeding in the managing of our Publick Affairs, confirms that belief; calls for a moſt grateful Acknowledgment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and encourages us to Hope as well as Pray, that God will be with you ſtill, that your Bow

ſhall abide in ſtrength, againſt all oppoſition; and the Arms of Your Hands be made ſtronger and ſtronger, by the Hands of the mighty God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> who ſhall bleſs Your Perſon and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, continue You as a Publick Bleſſing to theſe Provinces.</p>
               <p>And will Your <hi>Excellency</hi> give us leave to expect, as from a Perſon ſo admirably accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the exerciſe of Government in general, ſo familiarly acquainted with the circumſtances of our particular State, Humour and Intereſt, Duties, Dangers and Dependancies, ſo many ways Related to, and intereſted with us, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable Zeal for the Honour of God and Religion; a greater forwardneſs to lay out ſuch excellent Talents, &amp; improve ſuch ſingular Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages for the Good of the Lords People, Temporal &amp; Spiritual, than in reaſon we could expect from any other, not ſo qualified or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe <hi>Honourable Perſons</hi> that are, or may be Choſen this Day, and called to Aſſiſt His Excellency in Council, or any other parts of Government; it is the juſt expectation of thoſe by whom ye are Choſen nextly or more remotely, that in all things you will ſincerely deſign and endeavour to promote their Safety and Welfare. And whereas the intereſt of this People is chiefly a Religious Intereſt; and it is likely to fare with us on other accounts as it goes
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:001279_0043_0FB2146CC1D14178"/>
with Religion among us. Our great depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance under God is upon your <hi>Honours</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Care to ſee ſuch things as are provoking to him in the Land reformed; &amp; that ſuch things as he requires in order to a being pleaſed with us; and proſpering of us, be obſerved. And if any thing further can be done to encourage &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the liberal Education of the Youth in the Country, whereby Learning and good Manners may be upheld; it will be a very great Service to the Intereſt of Church and State, both in the Preſent and Succeeding Generation. We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beſeech your <hi>Honours</hi> in your Wiſdom to meditate it, and by your Authority to eſtabliſh a method for it.</p>
               <p>Thoſe <hi>Worthy Gentlemen</hi> that <hi>Repreſent</hi> the People of this Province in a <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> &amp; who have called me (the unworthieſt and unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of all the Lords Servants in the Miniſtry) to ſpeak on ſuch an Occaſion as <hi>this,</hi> muſt bear with me, if now I take the freedom to ſay, you are indeed betruſted with a very great Power of Liberty and Priviledge from the People you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent, (as well as from GOD &amp; the QUEEN) to have a Hand in Chuſing ſo many of their principal Rulers for them: To conſent &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in the making of thoſe Laws by which they ſhall be Ruled; and to the laying of all Publick Taxes upon them. What you do in theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, (which are all of very great concernment)
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:001279_0042_0FB214686E14FB58"/>
the People are obliged to ſtand to. Are not you therefore obliged to uſe utmoſt Prudence and Conſcience in all? Your Wiſdom and Fidelity, both are conſided in, with reference to theſe things; That you Elect ſuch only into the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> as upon good grounds you may judge to be Men that <hi>Fear GOD, and Honour the QUEEN,</hi> &amp; will be true to the beſt intereſt of this People, both in Spirituals and in Temporals. That then you concur with them in any further Acts of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlation neceſſary to promote the Intereſts of Holineſs, Juſtice and Peace in our Land. That you lay not unneceſſary Burdens of Charge on the People, conſidering their deep Poverty; Nor yet be unwilling to expend and lay out what is neceſſary to Defend the Country, <hi>this Principal Town,</hi> the Life, Liberties and Eſtates of the People in it: And likewiſe to ſupport the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment Honourably; I mean with the double Honour and due Reſpect, &amp; Maintainance or Reward.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our <hi>Spiritual Fathers</hi> in the Churches can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuſe but be Deſirous above all other things to ſee their <hi>Children Walking in the Truth,</hi> and <hi>Wayes of God,</hi> from a Hearty inclination thereunto. They greatly long for this Fruit of their Miniſterial Labours, and Prayers: and to leave this Pledge of the Lords Abiding Preſence with their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors. I preſume not to <hi>Direct</hi> or <hi>Counſel</hi> our <hi>Reverend Elders</hi> in any Caſe, but rather <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="unknown:001279_0041_0FB21466D7EC15A0"/>
them as Fathers, and ask their Prayers and Bleſſings for my ſelf and Brethren of the Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Generation: Particularly, This Bleſſing in our Text, <hi>That the God of our Fathers, even your God may be our God, and that he would be with us, as he has been and is with you,</hi> according to the Goſpel Charter, or ſpecial Promiſe of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.20. And help us to abide Faithful with Him both as <hi>Chriſtians</hi> &amp; as <hi>Miniſters,</hi> Endeavouring to Keep the Truths of God invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate, which we have received, and to hand them down along to Poſterity. To Keep the Worſhip of God and his Ordinances Pure and Incorrupt, and to promote the Sincere Converſion of Men as well as their outward Reformation. Reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace is not ſufficient, but <hi>Regeneration</hi> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſary to Salvation. This is Gods Work, but we may haply be inſtrumental to it: By Teaching the Nature and Neceſſity of CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERSION, Making that the Principal Subject of our Miniſtry or Doctrine. By Being or Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Examples of Holy and Righteous, Peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Charitable Walking: By inceſſant Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God for his Victorious Grace, to Change the Hearts of Men, and cauſe them to Walk in his Statutes. This is Gods Covenant with his People, and Miniſters as Advocates muſt put the Promiſe in ſuit for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Doctrine ſpeaks to the Body of the People. Several things,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="47" facs="unknown:001279_0049_0FB2147BD1E1FCD8"/>I. It calls to the Hearty Exerciſe of the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Affections, <hi>Joy</hi> &amp; <hi>Grief,</hi> or to <hi>Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving</hi> and <hi>Mourning,</hi> according to the different occaſſions for them.</p>
               <p n="1">(I.) <hi>New-England</hi> may yet <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord, and Joy in the God of her Salvation: He that is the God of Salvation is our God, and is in the midſt of us.</hi> Let us Admire &amp; Adore his Goodneſs in not leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us after ſo many Days &amp; Years of Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Be exceeding <hi>Thankful</hi> for what of his Gracious Preſence and the Fruits of it is ſeen and enjoyed. Thankfulneſs for a <hi>Little,</hi> is the way to have <hi>More,</hi> at leaſt, to have that continued and Bleſt unto us. Were the People of the Country generally more ſenſible of and affected with the Goodneſs of God in reſpect of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment we are under, and the Gracious Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of God with our <hi>Honourable</hi> GOVER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOUR &amp; COUNCIL, in the good Conduct &amp; Succesful Management of our Publick Affairs, Particularly, reſpecting the <hi>War;</hi> I ſay, were the Favour of Heaven in this regard more thankfully acknowledged, it would be a probable Means to have the Tranquility of our State Prolonged, and other Bleſſings added: <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.2. <hi>When as for the Tranſgreſſions of a Land, many are the Princes &amp; Rulers thereof,</hi> (either together contending for Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, or ſucceſſively by frequent Changes,) <hi>But by a man of Underſtanding &amp; Knowledge, the State thereof ſhall be prolonged. Moreover,</hi> If the Churches
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:001279_0050_0FB2147CE9247498"/>
and People of <hi>New-England</hi> were more <hi>Thankful</hi> for the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> &amp; Kingdom of our Glorious LORD, that is yet Viſible therein, for the Liberty of their Religion and free Exerciſe of it, without Subſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to New Articles of Faith, Worſhip or Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and had Wiſdom &amp; Grace rightly to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it, they would certainly ſee more of the bleſſed Fruits thereof. Bleſſed be God for what appearance there is of the <hi>Power of Godlineſs,</hi> for ſuch a Number of thoſe whoſe Hearts are towards Him, &amp; whoſe endeavour is to <hi>Walk in his ways,</hi> to <hi>Keep his Commandments, his Statutes &amp; his Judgments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) But <hi>New-England</hi> ought alſo to <hi>Mourn</hi> for what is wanting of this Bleſſing. Does iniquity abound in the Country, and the Love of many (in the Churches) <hi>wax Cold,</hi> and Profeſſors of Chriſtianity allow themſelves in many great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities? This argues Gods withdrawing, and may provoke to a leaving of us, unleſs it be generally lamented by us. This Duty indeed does chiefly concern Publick Perſons, tho' it lies upon all Chriſtians, <hi>Magiſtrates, Miniſters,</hi> &amp; other Officers of Church, and State. Publick Perſons muſt have Publick Affections as well as Relations. They are more Reſponſible to God than others, and more concerned in the Sins of the Land and Places where they have a Charge than others. Among Private Perſons, a <hi>Houſholder</hi> is more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible than a Private Member of the Family for any Diſorders, and ſo proportionably in greater
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:001279_0051_0FB2147E16FE8538"/>
and more Publick Societies. Now this is the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition as well as Duty of ſuch as are truly God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to grieve and mourn for the Sins of the Age, and Place they live in, and for the number of <hi>Tranſgreſſors: Pſal.</hi> 119.136. <hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>I beheld the Tranſgreſſors, and was grieved, becauſe they kept not thy Word.</hi> So <hi>Jeremiah</hi> Weeps in Secret for the Pride and obſtinacy of that Generation. Fit inſtances for the Chriſtian Magiſtrate &amp; Miniſter. But this is not enough: Except the Body of the People do lay to heart the Sins of the Times, there is little ground to expect better Times, or that they will continue as they are, but grow worſe and worſe, more Sinful, and more Miſerable ſtill.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As the Doctrine thus applied to our preſent mixt Condition, calls for the Exerciſe of theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Affections; So to ſtir up <hi>Our Selves</hi> to <hi>Take hold on God,</hi> that we may retain his Preſence, and receive his Bleſſings. The Prophet complains of an Univerſal Neglect hereof in his time, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.7. <hi>There is none that ſtirreth up himſelf to take hold on thee:</hi> The People were Pining away in their Sins and Miſery, by reaſon of the Lords Abſence, or Departure from them; the ground of his leaving them was <hi>their not laying hold of him,</hi> and want of ſtirring up themſelves the Cauſe of that Neglect. Is not this too much our Caſe? Indeed the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding of Sin is that which firſt provokes the Lord to take up thoughts of Departing; but tis for want of our Taking Hold of Him, that He
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:001279_0052_0FB2147F92326E98"/>
actually leaves and goes away: Not that He is over-forward to take Occaſion for it. Tis ſaid, <hi>He does not willingly afflict or grieve the Children of men, Lam.</hi> 3.33. Much leſs leave and forſake his own Children &amp; People. Nay, inſtead of this, There is great Backwardneſs, &amp; Lothneſs in God, (ſpeaking after the manner of Men:) <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.8. He ſays, <hi>How ſhall I give thee up</hi> Ephraim? <hi>How ſhall I deliver thee</hi> O Iſrael? Yet the Lord expects to be invited and urged to carry, or return if go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: that the Faithful among his People lay hold of Him, and not let him go quite. As the Spouſe did, <hi>Gant.</hi> 3.4. <hi>I held him, and would not let him go, till I brought him into my Mothers Houſe.</hi> God ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſhake off <hi>Jacob</hi> as willing to be rid of him; but when he would not let him go, He ſtays to <hi>Bleſs him, Gen.</hi> 32.26. Afterwards the Lord was taking his final leave of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> if <hi>Moſes</hi> had not laid ſtrong Hands upon him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.10, 11. But that Prevented. Does the Lord threaten to leave <hi>New-England,</hi> to give over his Work here? and cannot She find her Hands at ſuch a time, or has She no Heart to lay hold on Him? This were a more fearful Symptom of being forſaken than any other. Oh! Let us ſtir up our ſelves and one another to take hold of the Lord our God! And what other Hold of God have we but his Covenant? what have we to do with him in any other way? or what Expectation from him? Is this <hi>Immanuels</hi> Land? Are we the People of the
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:001279_0053_0FB214844A2B7848"/>
Lord? Has he any ſpecial right and intereſt in us? This is the ground of his Care for our Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty &amp; Welfare, &amp; chief Argument for us to plead with Him.
