            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>THE artificial communication of the ſmall-pox, an operation more generally known at preſent under the name of inoculation, has been practiſed time imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial, in Circaſſia, Georgia, and the countries bordering upon the Caſpian ſea. Tho' unknown in the greateſt part of Europe, it was in uſe in the principality of Wales in England. It was formerly known, and ſince neglected in Greece and Turky, and was not revived again at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople till towards the end of the laſt century, when a Theſſalian woman practiſed it there with great ſucceſs; but this was only among the lower claſs of people. This cuſtom is very ancient, and generally received in the iſland of Cephalonia, ſubject to the republic of Venice; it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the Morea, and the iſland of Candia. If we go out of Europe, we ſhall find it at Bengal, and ſo long practiſed on the coaſt, and in the interior of Africa, at Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, that its origin is unknown, but proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly introduced in the time of the Arabs. In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the laſt century, the ſmall-pox was communicated at China, without inciſion, but through the noſe, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring the matter of ſome dried puſtules reduced to pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. All theſe facts were buried in oblivion, till Emanuel Timone, a Greek phyſician, and member of the univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Padua and Oxford, having undertaken to bring inoculation into ſome vague, gave an ample diſcription of it in a letter to Dr. Woodward, written from Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the month of December, 1713. During the eight years he had attended the operation in that capital, there were only two fatal events, whoſe cauſes were foreign to inoculation, one of the patients having died of a dyſentery the 32d day, and the other of a maraſmus, the 40th after the operation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="unknown:012825_0004_0F8B41B02A79F660"/>James Pilarini, another Greek phyſician, who had long diſapproved the new method, at laſt, fully convinced of its utility from the evidence of facts, wrote an apology for the artificial ſmall-pox, in a ſmall Latin work, printed at Venice in 1715. The Theſſalian woman aſſures us ſhe had inoculated 6000 perſons in the year 1713. Of this number were the greater part of the Engliſh, Dutch, and French merchants ſettled at Conſtantinople. Anthony Le Duc, another Greek, who we alſo inoculated by this woman, received afterwards, in 1722, the Doctor's cap, at Leyden, maintained publicly the practice if inoculation.</p>
               <p>Madam Wortley Montague, the Engliſh Ambaſſador's Lady at the Ottoman Porte, in 1717, had her only ſon, about ſix years old, inoculated there by her ſurgeon, and afterwards her daughter, on her return to England, where the example was followed by ſeveral perſons of diſtinction. It was by the deſire of the College of Phyſicians, at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, that the experiment was made on ſix criminals; it ſaved a life they deſerved to loſe by their crimes. The late Queen of England then Princeſs of Wales, had two of her younger daughters, the late Queen of Denmark, and the Princeſs of Heſſe-Caſſel, inoculated in 1722: This operation, conducted under the Direction of Dr. Sloane, contributed greatly to inhance the reputation of this new preſervative. Whilſt the moſt famous phyſicians of Great-Britain, the Doctors Sloane, Fuller, Arbuthnot, Jurin, Mead, &amp;c. favoured the new method, or wrote in its favour; whilſt Dr. Shadwell, &amp;c. practiſed it on their children, Blackmore and Wagſtaffe, two phyſicians little known, and Maſſey, an apothecary, ſeemed to endeavour to get a name by proſcribing it. Whilſt the Biſhop of Saliſbury and other caſuiſts ſuffered their children to be inoculated, other divines pretended that it brought down the wrath of Heaven on the nation: To prove this, ſome were ſo abſurd as to aledge the great numbers that died of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſmall-pox, and one, in particular, boldly aſſerted in his ſermon, that the devil himſelf had given Job the ſmall-pox, by this infernal method.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="unknown:012825_0005_0F8B41B0A5440DE8"/>However, beſides the experiments of Conſtantinople, where, in one year, upwards of 10,000 perſons had happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſed through this trial, a great number were inoculated in England without any accident. Dr. Jurin, Secretary to the Royal Society, publiſhed ſeveral pieces in 1723, and 1724, whereof ſome are inſerted in the Philoſophical Tranſactions, giving an account of the ſucceſsful experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made in Great-Britain and New-England, with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral letters by way of ſupplement and proofs, and exact liſts of the ſick, and thoſe that died of the natural and artificial ſmall pox; together with compariſons of their effects. It appears from his calculat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:012825_0006_0F8B41B1615274E0"/>The ſucceſs of the new method was firſt known in France, by a letter M. de la Coſte, a Doctor to phyſic, addreſſed to M. Dodard, the King's firſt phyſician, and publiſhed at Paris in 1723, with the approbation of M. Burette, a Doctor of the faculty of Paris. In this letter, followed by ſome others of M. Sloane, M. Amyand, &amp;c. the advantages of inoculation are properly ſtated, the liſts and calculations of M. Jurin are cited, and ſome new facts are advanced, with judicious arguments, and anſwers to objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Mention is alſo made therein of a conſultation of nine of the moſt famous Doctors of Sorbonne, whom the author had the ſatisfaction to ſee conclude at laſt, `that it was licit, in the view of being ſerviceable to the public to make experiments of that practice.' The ſame letter ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, that M. Dodard, and ſeveral other famous phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as the late M. Chirac, M. Helvetius, &amp;c. approved the new method. In the ſame work is quoted a letter of M. Aſtruc, wherein he expreſſes himſelf, `that he did not judge that the operation could be attended with any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and that he was glad it was intended to be prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed at Paris.</p>
               <p>The falſe reports that were induſtriouſly ſpread of the ill ſucceſs of inoculation, at Boſton, during the ſummer of 1723; the number carried off by the epidemy that ſame year at London, and falſely attributed to the operation; ſome miſfortunes cauſed by the imprudence of young per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons newly inoculated, who committed exceſſes; had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed the public confidence. Theſe reports reached Paris when the phyſicians had reſolved upon making their experiments. After the ſucceſs of thoſe in England, and particularly on the Royal family, it was high time for making eſſays in France, at leaſt in the hoſpitals. They were favoured by the Duke of Orleans, Regent of France; but his eyes were ſcarce cloſed, when a theſis was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the ſchools of medicine, which, ſounding the alarm againſt the inoculators, treated their operation as criminal, thoſe that practiſed as impoſtors and execution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the patients as dupes.</p>

               <p>Whilſt it ſeemed to loſe ground in Europe, it made new conqueſts in Aſia. The epidemy of 1723, the plague of Europe and America, made perhaps the tour of the world. The Tartars, among whom the ſmall-pox is not common, were infected, and the greater part of grown-up perſons died of it. Father Dentrecolles, a Jesuit Miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in his very curious letter of the 11th of May, 1726, at Pekin, relates that, in 1724, the Emperor of China ſent phyſicians from his palace into Tartary, to ſow there the artifical ſmall-pox; this is the name the Chineſe give their method of inſertion, of which we ſhall ſpeak in its place. Undoubtedly the ſucceſs of the Chineſe phyſicians was fortunate, having brought back with them a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of horſes, ſkins, and furs, which are the riches and money of the Tartars.</p>
               <p>In other parts, the practice of inoculation, after the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean manner, was perfected in ſilence during the time of its diſgrace: Its progreſs was leſs divulged, but its ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary effects were not therefore leſs conſpicuous, both in the antient and new world. Much about the year 1728, a Carmelite Miſſionary, in the neighbourhood of the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe colony of Grand Para, in South-America, ſeeing all the Indians of his miſſion dying one after another of an epidemical ſmall-pox, and that not one infected perſon recovered, he ſaved all thoſe that remained, by hazarding on them, the method of inoculation, of which he had but a very ſuperficial knowledge, from an European gazette. His example was followed not leſs ſucceſsfully by one of his brethren, a Miſſionary on the banks of Rio Negro, and by ſome Portugueſe of Para. In a new epidemy that laid waſte that province in 1750, the ſame preſervative produced the ſame effect. A terrible epidemy ravaged
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012825_0008_0F8B41B3029A1B70"/>
Carolina in 1738; all thoſe who were taken ill could not reſiſt the violence of the diſtemper. Then it was that they called to mind how efficacious the remedy was, which they had neglected ſince the year 1724; they had again recourſe to inoculation, which ſucceded better than ever, becauſe, in the hot ſultry months of June, July, and Auguſt, a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon very contrary to inflammatory diſeaſes, and in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where the method had not ſucceded ſo well as in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, of a thouſand perſons inoculated, but eight died, which is only one to 125. It is very probable that in the experiments made in America, on a multitude of negro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaves, leſs precautions were uſed in preparing the ſubjects, than in the operations made in Europe on free-men, whoſe lives were more precious: Beſides, the generality of the negroes are originally infected with a veneral virus, which they bring from their country, and therefore the choice of fit ſubjects for inoculation is thereby rendered more difficult.</p>
               <p>The new ſucceſs of the practice in Carolina, in 1738, was not equal to that of the ſame year in England, when it began again to take place. Of near 2000 inoculated within twelve years at Wincheſter, and the neighbouring parts of Hampſhire and Suſſex, none died, according to the account of Dr. Langriſh, but two women with child, who were diſſuaded by their phyſicians to expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to inoculation.</p>
               <p>The year 1746 was, at London, the epocha of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a houſe of charity, as well for inoculating the poor, and diminiſhing by this means the devaſtation, made by the ſmall-pox, of mankind, as for ſuccouring thoſe who might be taken ill of it in the natural way. It was in the church of this hoſpital, and in the ſame pulpit where, 30 years before, inoculation had been treated as the work of devils, that Dr. Maddox, Biſhop of Worceſter, preached that famous ſermon, ſeveral times reprinted, whereby he excites the charity of his fellow-citizens in favour of this practice, of which he demonſtrates the advantages: The
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012825_0009_0F8B41B3AAAC54E8"/>
annexed notes to this ſermon, and the work publiſhed by M. Kirkpatrick, inform us that of 309 perſons the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part adults, inoculated in the new hoſpital, and of 1500 inoculated by three different Practitioners, that is, of 1809, but ſix died, which does not make one in 300; that M. Wincheſter, Surgeon to the Foundling hoſpital, loſt but one child in 186; and that, of 370 other experiments made elſe where, one only had proved unfortunate. M. Frevin aſſures us, that, of upwards of 300 inoculations at Rye, but one was unſucceſsful. It is true, that at Saliſbury four died out of 422, and three at Blandford out of 309.</p>
               <p>In the month of November, 1747, M. Ranby, firſt Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon to his Britannic Majeſty, had inoculated 827, and his experiments, all fortunate, amounted at the end of 1752, to upwards of 1000. The difference of ſucceſs may be partly attributed to the greater or leſs degree of malignity in the epidemy, partly to the greater or leſs ſhare of precaution in preparing and tending the ſick, and, laſtly, to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent degrees of experience and abilities of the inoculators, but eſpecially to the maxim of not hazarding inoculation on perſons of a bad conſtitution, unwholſome, or ſuſpected of other diſorders. The Greek woman at Conſtantinople was exceeding ſcrupulous in all theſe points, and it was to her exact obſervance of them, that ſhe attributed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of her ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>In reſuming the foregoing facts, and ſeveral others of which I omit the detail, I find, that, in the whole, out of 316 inoculated, but one died.</p>
               <p>In 1748, one Dr. Tronchin, a native of Geneva, and Inſpector of the College of Phyſicians of Amſterdam, having been on the point of loſing one of his ſons by the natural ſmall-pox, reſolved to inoculate his eldeſt: This was the firſt inoculation in Holland. It was followed by nine others, which M. Tronchin took upon him the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of. Two years after, he recommended this practice at Geneva, which being accordingly adopted, M. Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drini, a famous Mathematician, and one of the chief Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates of the republic, ſet the example on his ſon, no
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012825_0010_0F8B41B46340A880"/>
fatal event has ſince occaſioned there any regret. The ſame year, inoculation was introduced in Italy, by Dr. Peverini, then phyſician of Citerna, in the Eccleſiaſtical State, with very happy and ſingular circumſtances. He was imitated by ſeveral of his confraternity, and upwards of 400 perſons, of all ages, were ſucceſsfully inoculated in thoſe parts.</p>
               <p>In 1753, inoculation began again at Amſterdam with the epidemy, and the moſt illuſtrious families at the Hague were the firſt to follow the example of M. Tron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin. The ſuffrage of M. Swenke, Profeſſor of Anatomy, and a phyſician of great reputation in his profeſſion, and the continuity of ſucceſs, brought the method into requeſt in ſeveral towns of Holland. Switzerland, as well as Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, is indebted for it to the example of a tender mother, a lady of Lauzane, who, ſeeing that her ſon did not catch the ſmall-pox from his two ſiſters, gave it to him by the way of inſertion.</p>
               <p>Such have been for upwards of 30 years viciſſitudes of fortune in the famous method of inoculation. The eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic and bark did not meet with leſs contradictions, till their virtues were generally known. But, before we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, it will not be amiſs to give a diſtinct idea of inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as being an eſſential part of its hiſtory, and of the different manner of practiſing it, by thoſe who know it but imperfectly.</p>
               <p>The artificial ſmall pox is probably more ancient at China than elſewhere. Father Dentrecolles, obſerves in his letter above-mentioned, that if this cuſtom was introduced from Circaſſia, or the adjacent parts, into China, it would, in all probability, have firſt extended into the weſtern provinces, and the neareſt to the Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian ſea; whereas it is in the other extremity of that emplie, towards the Eaſt, and in the province of Kiangnan, on the ſea of Japan, that the method of Tchong-teou, that is, of ſowing the ſmall-pox, is more antiently known. The Chineſe thruſt into the noſe of children a tent of cotton

impregnated with the matter of the dried puſtules of the ſmall-pox reduced into powder. This trial was made in England, in 1721, on a young woman under ſentence of death: She was more ſick than any inoculated in the uſual way, and the Chineſe practice, of which father Dentrecol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les relates three different receipts, was judged dangerous.</p>
               <p>Both in Greece and Turky, the liquid matter, ſtill hot, drawn, ſome moment before, from puſtules of a natural and fovourable ſmall pox, was introduced in ſeven or eight punctures made in different parts of the body, with ſeveral ſuperſtitious precautions accompanied with offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of wax candles, by the means of which Timone ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the Greek inoculatreſs procured the good-will of the Grecian prieſts, who ſupplied her with a prodigious multitude of ſubjects for inoculation.</p>
               <p>The ſame Timone deſcribes the different operations of two Grecian old women: The one of Philippopolis, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more ſimple in her proceſs; the other of Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica, who joined quackery to ſuperſtition, but who, more ſkilful than any of her ſiſterhood, had remarked, as the Chineſe, that it was indifferent to uſe for inoculation mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taken from a natural or artificial ſmall-pox. LaMotraye relates the manner of his ſeeing the operation conducted in Circaſſia, by an old woman, much after the way at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople. She only made punctures on different parts of the body with three pins tied together; the patient was brought as, is ſtill practiſed in Barbary, to one ſick of the natural ſmall-pox. This cuſtom is dangerous, the inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated party being thereby expoſed to receive the diſtemper by contagion, before the inſertion produces its effect; but this conformity of practice between the Circaſſians and the people of Barbary might be an inducement to preſume, that, among the great number of Circaſſian ſlaves, who compoſe the militia of Cairo, by the name of Mamelus, ſome of them had brought the cuſtom from their country into Egypt, from whence it might have been propagated at Tripoli, Tunis, Algeries, and in the interior of Africa.</p>

                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:012825_0012_0F8B41B5DCB0B230"/>In the principality of Wales, leſs formality was uſed. School-boys gave one another the ſmall-pox by pricking themſelves with a needle, or by only rubbing the arm or the hand till the blood appeared, with puſtules of the ſmall-pox that began to dry; he that was to get it, gave two or three pence to him from whom he borrowed the matter, and this cuſtom had no other name among the Welch, than of buying the ſmall-pox. Long experience has giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in England the preference to the following method, which has been long practiſed by M. Ranby, and ſince at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended at Geneva with the greateſt ſucceſs, both on children and adults to the age of thirty.</p>
               <p>After preparing the ſubject during ſome days by a regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and proper remedies, ſuch as a moderate diet, one or two gentle purges, a bleeding, if the caſe requires it, and ſometimes bathing; <note n="*" place="bottom">Doct. Dimſdale, undoubtedly one of the moſt ingenious inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators, in Europe, prefers the following method of infecting his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients. The perſon to be inoculated, being in the ſame room, with one who has the diſeaſe, a little pus is taken from a ripe puſtule, on the point of a lancet. With this lancet an inciſion is made in that part of the arm where uſually iſſues are placed, deep enough to paſs the ſcarf ſkin about the eighth of an inch in length. The wound being opened between the thumb and fingers of the operator, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on the point of the lancet is wip'd on the wound. Neither plaiſter, bandage, or covering is applied. The Doctor obſerves, that this method had never once fail'd him. At the time of Dimſdale's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

This matter has been found to preſerve its virtue for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral months together and from Autumn to Spring: The Chineſe have made the ſame obſervation. This apparel, after forty hours is taken off, and the wounds are dreſſed

once a day. However, this long delay may, in a great meaſure, be deemed an exceſs of precaution; five or ſix hours were thought ſufficient by the Greek inoculators, who, after pricking in four or five places were only careful to mix well the blood and variolous matter with their needle, and to cover the punctures with a walnut-ſhell.</p>
               <p>Though the firſt days after the operation the patient is in a condition of going out, yet he is made to keep his chamber and to continue the regimen. <note n="†" place="bottom">Since De la Condamine wrote, great improvements have been made by Inoculators in Europe and America. The preſent and moſt approved method of treating both the natural, and artificial ſmall-pox, is that the patient goes abroad in all weathers, from the time of inoculation, 'till the termination of the diſeaſe; that a free uſe of cold water as common drink be indulged. Cold air, which phyſicians ſuppos'd would endanger the lives of thoſe expos'd to it, while under the influence of the ſmall-pox, has been found, Firſt by accident, and ſince, by repeated, judicious experiments, to prevent, frequently, the ſecondary fever, and always to leſſen it. See Dimſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale on inoculation.</note> He is put to bed the 6th or 7th day, when the fever begins, which is ſeldom accompanied by bad ſymptoms, as they uſually ceaſe by the eruption on the 7th or 8th day: Then the inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wounds diminiſhes; they yeild more matter, and the greater part of the venom flows out by that way. The 10th day after the eruption they begin to fill, the 15th to be cicatriſed, and the 20th they uſually cloſe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; if they are preceived ſtill to flow, they ſhould not be cloſed too haſtily. One inciſion has been found ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; and, if two are made, it is not only to be more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the inſertion has taken well, but alſo to facilitate, by a double canal, the iſſue of the variolous matter, and in order thereby to render that which forms the puſtules leſs abundant, leſs acrimonious, leſs corroſive, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſmall-pox more benign. Theory agrees won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully in this point with experience.</p>
               <p>Sometimes all, or almoſt all, the venom flows out thro' the two inciſions, and the patient has but one or two puſtules, ſometimes even not one; he is not therefore leſs
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012825_0014_0F8B41B9AA316C10"/>
ſecure from contracting the ſmall-pox, when inoculated anew. The more the matter comes out abundantly from the wounds of the arms, the more the number of puſtules are few and diſtinct; whereas each parcel of the matter of the internal heat forms a particular puſtule in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſmall-pox, which often makes it confluent, and therefore much more dangerous. Among the inoculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at Geneva, that kind was ſcarce obſerved; and not one retained the leaſt mark. This was alſo obſerved not only in England, but in Greece and Circaſſia, whereof the inhabitants adopted the cuſtom with the view only of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the beauty of their daughters.</p>
               <p>What occaſions the greateſt danger in the natural ſmall-pox, is the ſecondary fever that happens when the ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion begins; but in the artificial ſmall-pox, that fever is very rare, eſpecially in children, who ſcarce ſicken. Among 20 perſons inoculated at Geneva, by M. Guyot, one only, a woman, and the mother of ſeveral Children had that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond fever.</p>
               <p>This method of inoculating by inciſion, adopted now upwards of 30 years, by all the Engliſh ſurgeons, and commonly practiſed at Geneva, was brought from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople to England, by M. Maitland, ſurgeon to Lady Wortley Montague. Maitland received it from Timone, who had ſubſtituted it to the punctures of the Greek inoculators. In the firſt eſſays made in Italy, the lancet was ſometimes uſed, and ſometimes only the prick of a pin, in imitation of the ſimplicity of the Greek operation, eſpecially in country places, where mothers, unknown to their huſbands, inoculated their children, while they were, aſleep, and always with ſucceſs. M. Tronchin was the firſt, for aught I know, that uſed veſicatories, as leſs pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and leſs terrible to children. He applied them to the legs preferably to the arms, with the view of procuring, for the bed-rid patient, a greater liberty in his motions; but, as the eſſence of inoculation conſiſts intirely in the mixture of the variolous matter with the blood of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon inoculated, it little ſignifies, provided the mixture
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012825_0015_0F8B41BA5E3031F8"/>
operates, whether the wound from whence the blood is drawn, be made on one of ſeveral parts of the body; with a lancet as in England; with two or three needles as in Greece and Circaſſia; with one only as in Italy; by paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the ſkin a thread imbued with matter, as in Barbary; by rubbing the hand till the blood appears, as in the principality of Wales; or, laſtly, in breaking the texture of the epidermis with a veſicatory, according to the practice of M. Tronchin. All theſe routes conduct to the ſame end, and each may chuſe that which ſeems moſt agreeable to him.</p>

                     <hi>Firſt Objection.</hi> IS it the ſmall-pox that is communicated by inoculation? And may not the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper communicated be more dangerous than that which is intended to be prevented?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> If it was ever doubted that the inflammatory diſeaſe which follows inoculation, was a real ſmall-pox, none now make the leaſt doubt about it; it would be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unneceſſary to anſwer the firſt part of the objection. As to the ſecond part, it may be ſaid, that the natural ſmall-pox is not dangerous in itſelf, but only becomes ſo by a complication of diſorders with it, or by the maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the epidemy. Such a perſon, cut off in the flower of his age, might ſtill have been living, were it not for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attacked by the ſmall-pox in critical circumſtances: That young woman would not have died, if the accidents
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012825_0016_0F8B41BB1CB48E78"/>
of a laborious pregnancy had not exhauſted her ſtrength: That young man would have been out of danger, had not his blood been inflamed by all manner of exceſſes: That ſick perſon might have eſcaped, if a malignant fever and the purples had not aggravated his illneſs. This is what we daily hear of the circumſtances that make this diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per mortal. Inoculation will prevent them all. The greateſt art of the preparation conſiſts in preventing fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign accidents, a complication of diſorders, and the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy; a proper choice may be made of the ſeaſon, time, place, and the diſpoſitions of the ſubject's mind and body; the ſmall-pox thus prevented is brought ſlowly from the circumference to the center, in a wholeſome body pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for receiving it: Fermentation begins in the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal parts; the artificial wounds facilitate the eruption, by giving the virus an eaſy iſſue. Thus the inoculated ſmall-pox is always ſimple, and therefore without any danger.</p>
                  <p>What compariſon can be made between a premeditated diſeaſe and one contracted by chance, on a journey, in the army, in critical circumſtances, and eſpecially for women in a time of epidemy, which multiplies accidents, which tranſports the ſeat of the inflammation in the internal parts of a body, perhaps exhauſted by watching or fatigue? How great is the difference between a diſeaſe which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and one that ſurpriſes, diſmays, and fear alone may make mortal, or, appearing with equivocal ſymptoms, may lead into an error the ableſt phyſicians? Such are the dictates of good ſenſe, and the moſt ſimple reaſoning, but experience is ſtill more deciſive; it proves that the matter of inoculation, though taken from a complicated ſmall-pox, confluent, even mortal communicates, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, a ſimple, diſcrete, benign ſmall-pox, exempt from the fever of ſuppuration, ſo frequently fatal; in ſhort, a ſmall-pox which leaves no marks. Hence it is evident that the inoculated ſmall-pox is not more danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than the natural</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="unknown:012825_0017_0F8B41BBDE3C3048"/>
                     <hi>Second Objection.</hi> Does the inoculated ſmall-pox ſave from the natural?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> This objection cannot be better anſwered, than by a hiſtory of facts, whereby it appears, that not one inoculated perſon had contracted the ſmall-pox a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time. The enemies of this method have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all manner of ways to elude this truth, even by that of impoſture. Dr. Middleton was obliged to declare publicly againſt a report, that one of thoſe he had inoculated was again infected with the ſmall-pox, of which he had been very ill. Mention was made of another, with the letter of one Jones, who aſſerted the ſame thing of his ſon; Dr. Jurin examined carefully into the fact; the father refuſed to ſhew the child's marks, but offered afterwards to tell the truth provided he was well paid for ſo doing: At laſt, he confeſſed, in a letter to Dr. Jurin, that he knew nothing of inoculation. Dr. Kirkpatrick has inſerted this letter in his work.</p>
                  <p>But what does it ſignify to know whether a complete ſmall-pox may be had twice naturally? Though this fact, which ſeveral phyſicians deny, and which Dr. Mead, in the courſe of a long life, ſays he had never ſeen, ſhould be well atteſted, it would not neceſſarily follow that a perſon, after being inoculated, ſhould be ſubject to have it again. Granting that it is poſſible to have the ſmall-pox, twice in the natural way, might not it be maintained, with ſome ſhew of probability, that the natural cauſes of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion do not ſhoot forth perhaps but imperfectly in a body the bud of the diſtemper, ſo that ſometives a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency remains for a new fermetation; whereas the ferment of the ſmall-pox, ſet in motion by a virus of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture introduced directly into the blood by the means of ſeveral inciſions, flows out in ſo complete a manner, that no more matter remains to form a ſecond eruption. A more powerful cauſe ought to produce a greater effect: Milk turns and coagulates more ſurely and effectually by the direct mixture of an acid, than by the natural action
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012825_0018_0F8B41BCA8CB5C00"/>
of air and heat: The artificial ſmall-pox may therefore exhauſt the leaven which the natural may not. But, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aſide theſe reaſons, will it not be ſufficient to ſay, in order to avert the dread of a ſecond ſmall-pox after inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that now, upwards of 30 years ſince it became fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in England, no example can be produced of any inoculated perſon, who had been again infected, either na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally or artificially? Thoſe, on whom inoculation might have been attempted without effect, are improperly ranked in the number of the inoculated; the operation well or ill conducted, when it produces neither puſtule nor ſuppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, leaves the ſuject in the ſame ſtate he was in; if therefore he is afterwards attacked by the natural ſmall-pox, it cannot be ſaid that he has had it twice.</p>
                  <p>Some inoculated children have been made to cohabit and lie with others ill of the ſpontaneous ſmall-pox, and none of them took it a ſecond time. Eliſabeth Harris, one of ſix criminals inoculated on the firſt trial, after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, nurſed upwards of twenty perſons ſick of the ſmall-pox, and the contagion had no effect upon her. Inoculation has been repeated ſeveral times on different ſubjects; but the effects of the firſt being over, the inciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, notwithſtanding the thread imbued with virus, healed as ſlight cuts: It is therefore evident that the variolic virus, though mixed directly with the blood, is incapable of renewing the ſmall-pox; from whence it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with good reaſon, that the natural contagion, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the air, will have no effect on a body purged of this leaven by inoculation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Third Objection.</hi> The ſmall parcel of venom, tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the blood by the way of inoculation, may be the bud or ſeed of other diſtempers, which may be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the ſame way, ſuch as the ſcurvy, King's evil, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The riſque of catching theſe diſeaſes, at the ſame time with the ſmall-pox, would not be leſs great, when it is contracted naturally, than when it is received by inoculation. However, as no inſtance has been ſeen of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012825_0019_0F8B41BDA179EA70"/>
ſcurvy, King's evil, &amp;c. contracted in this manner by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion of the natural ſmall-pox; why ſhould the danger be greater in this reſpect by the way of inoculation? This is not all: There are poſitive proofs that this danger is chimerical, and it is now known by experience, that the variolic matter, though taken from a body infected alſo with a venereal virus, communicated only a ſimple and benign ſmall-pox: This fact, deciſive and not admitting a reply, is atteſted in Dr. Maty's Britiſh Journal, for April, 1754, pag. 403; yet, as the choice of matter for inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation may be diſcretionally made, nothing hinders the taking of it from a wholeſome ſubject, and eſpecially from a child who has no other diſtemper than the ſmall-pox itſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Nothing is more unjuſt than this objection: Theſe accidents are but too frequent after the natural ſmall-pox, but very rare after inoculation; they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by purgatives.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt Objection.</hi> It would be an uſurpation of the rights of the Divinity to afflict with a diſeaſe one who has it not, or to endeavour to withdraw him from it, who, in the order of Providence, was naturally deſtined for having it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> This objection, if it can be called ſo, is that of Fataliſts and rigid Predeſtinarians. They might be anſwered that the inoculated was predeſtined for inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that by inoculating him the decrees of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence were accompliſhed; but, without retorting againſt them this ſingular argument, they may be aſked, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confidence in Providence exempts and diſpenſes us from preventing the ills we foreſee, and which we may ſecure ourſelves from by a prudent attention. Thoſe of this principle, if they act conſequently to it, ought to proſcribe the uſe of all remedies of precaution, and of all preſervatives; they ought to imitate the example of the Turks, who, thro' fear of acting contrary to the views of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012825_0020_0F8B41BE3374DA00"/>
Providence, periſh by thouſands in times of peſtilence ſo frequent at Conſtantinople, whilſt they ſee the Franks, ſettled among them, ſecure themſelves from the fatal ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the contagion, both in town and country, by ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves up carefully in their houſes, to avoid all exterior communication; thoſe who here plead the rights of Divine Providence, may therefore be aſked, Whether, when Providence permits the diſcovery of a ſure method of preſervation from the ravages of the ſmall-pox, we are forbid to make uſe of it? It is Providence that preſents us with the remedy, and it would be an offence to reject its gifts with contempt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixth Objection.</hi> It is not allowable to infect with a cruel and dangerous diſeaſe one who perhaps may never have it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It cannot be ſaid, with any ſhew of truth, that the inoculated ſmall-pox is either cruel or dangerous. An inciſion which only cuts through the ſurface of the ſkin, a ſimple puncture, or the application of a veſicatory, a ſlight fever attended with ſome ſymptoms which ſcarce laſt 24 hours, cannot be ſaid to conſtitute a cruel diſeaſe; and a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, by which not above one may die in 300, or perhaps not one in a thouſand, cannot be called dangerous. It may even be doubtful, whether this death of one, out of ſo many, can be juſtly attributed to inoculation.</p>
                  <p>But if, out of 320 perſons taken at chance, one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly dies, how comes it to paſs that M. Ranby did not loſe one in 1200? The reaſon is, his choice was confined to young ſubjects of ſound conſtitutions. When perſons of all ages are inoculated without choice or precaution, as was done at Boſton in the firſt trials, the greater part ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of corrupt blood and humours, and in a time of epidemy, when ſeveral, before undergoing the operation, had already probably received the diſeaſe by natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion, there will be no room for being ſurpriſed that one died in 49 or 50.</p>
                  <p>It may therefore be granted, that the inoculated ſmall-pox is neither dangerous, nor cruel, as the objection ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes it. `But it will be ſaid, it cannot be denied to be a
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012825_0021_0F8B41C037C125C8"/>
diſeaſe; why therefore ſhould it be given gratis to one who perhaps might never have it?' This is the moſt ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of all the arguments that can be made againſt this prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and yet the eaſieſt to be refuted.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, firſt, that this diſeaſe is not given to one who might never have it naturally. For, either all men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception, are ſubject to the ſmall-pox, or ſome are free from it: In the firſt caſe, it cannot be ſaid that the diſeaſe is given to one who might never have it: The ſame will hold good in the ſecond, it being proved by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that ſome could not get the ſmall pox by inoculation, though the operation had been ſeveral times repeated; no doubt they were no way diſpoſed to receive the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. He who has not the principle of it in his blood, will be free from it by an operation leſs painful than a bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the inciſions will dry up as a ſlight cut: Thus he will ſee himſelf for ever delivered from the continual un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs thoſe are under, who have not yet paid the tribute; this proof will be a ſecurity to him that he is for ever ſafe from the contagion. It is even the only way of baniſhing the fears of thoſe, who, by not having the ſmall-pox in a deciſive manner, or not knowing that they had it in their infancy, ſpend their days ſo as to make life a puniſhment. Therefore a diſeaſe, as the objection ſuppoſes, is not given to one who might never have it.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, in the ſecond place, that the ſmall-pox is a diſeaſe which may be called general, and to which Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is willing mankind ſhould be ſubject; that the number of thoſe who arrive at old-age without having it, is ſo ſmall, that it ſcarce forms exceptions to the common law. But what is done by inoculating the ſmall-pox? The very ſame thing whereby a fit of the gout is excited, when the particles of that painful diſorder are diſperſed throughout the maſs of the blood; in both caſes a diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is not ſo much given to a body free from contracting it, as the moſt favourable time is choſen to give vent to the ferment that occaſions it, and which we all have in our
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012825_0022_0F8B41C05D7D0AB0"/>
blood; the venting of which ferment is almoſt inevitable in regard to the ſmall-pox, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Seventh Objection.</hi> It is not allowable to do a leſs evil, to procure a greater good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> This objection is founded on an equivocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Let us ſuppoſe that this principle is in rigour and generally true, and that it admits no exception, no reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to moral evil; but it is very falſe in the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of it to phyſical evil. Certainly it is allowable to pull down a houſe to preſerve a town or city from a conflagration, though the proprietor of this houſe with his family, might be reduced to beggary by ſo doing; a whole province may be laid under water, or ruined for ſeveral years, in the view of preventing the further ravages of an enemy; a ſhip, if ſuſpected to have the plague on board, though perhaps ready to periſh, is refuſed admittance into a port: And thus the inconſiderable phyſical evil of inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is nothing, if compared with the evils of all ſorts which are tolerated, permited, and authoriſed by the laws of moſt nations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eighth Objection.</hi> Inoculation is a moral evil; as a proof of which, it cannot be denied but ſome inoculated perſons have died; the ſucceſs of the method is therefore not infallible; one cannot therefore ſubject himſelf to it without expoſing his life, which he is not allowed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of: Therefore inoculation runs counter to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of morality.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Firſt, the objection may be cut ſhort by maintaining, that none die of the inoculated ſmall-pox, and that the accidents, attributed to inoculation, are owing to no other cauſe than the imprudence of the ſick, or of the phyſician: Several able phyſicians have been of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: M. Tronchin was ſo thoroughly perſuaded of it, that he declared openly, if he loſt one ſingle patient by the artificial ſmall-pox, he would inoculate no more while he lived.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="unknown:012825_0023_0F8B41C11CA1E908"/>Secondly, the argument, here advanced againſt inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may be retorted againſt bleeding in the arm: How many have died by the pricking of arteries? It is then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that life is endangered by bleeding in the arm, which cannot with the ſame evidence be aſcertained in regard to inoculation; yet no caſuiſt has hitherto been ſo ſcrupulous, as to forbid letting blood in the arm.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it may be obſerved that the ſuppoſed ſingulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of inoculation, that is, of giving a diſtemper one has not, is common to this preſervative and all other remedies of medicine, no natural diſorder being cured but by arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial evils, which are not even exempt from danger, ſuch as bleedings, purgatives, cauteries, veſicatories, vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>It is granted that it is the duty of every one to avoid the dangers life may be threatened with; but what becomes of this obligation when the danger is inevitable? It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently converted into that of leſſening the danger as much as poſſible; but the riſque of having ſome time or other the ſmall-pox, and perhaps dying of it, is inevitable in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to him who never had it; therefore inoculation is a ſure means of diminiſhing, in a great degree, this danger.</p>
                  <p>It is evident, that, when the ſmall-pox is expected from the hands of nature, the parties expoſe themſelves to die ſome time or other; but this riſque is beheld as far diſtant, becauſe it ſeems it ſhould not begin but when the attacks are felt, which are not yet, and perhaps, as they flatter themſelves, may never be. To determine exactly the reſque of death incurred by him who never had the natural ſmall-pox, it would be neceſſary to know what part of mankind is not ſubject to the diſeaſe; but it may be ſaid with good reaſon, that the inſtances of thoſe who paſs thro' life, after having arrived at manhood, and having been within the reach of infection, without undergoing this dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſeaſe, are ſo extremely few, as ſcarce to form an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; learned calculations have made it as one to many hundreds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="24" facs="unknown:012825_0024_0F8B41C26DC59720"/>The riſque of dying one time or other of the ſmall-pox, which ſeems ſo far diſtant in time of health, is almoſt as great as if one was already effected. In a word, of 70 ſick of the ſmall-pox, 10 die; of 70 who expect it, 9 will probably die: Could it be believed that between theſe two riſques there was ſo little difference?</p>
                  <p>The riſque of dying of the ſmall-pox gradually increaſes from the moment of birth. This reſque is of a fourteenth for a new-born child; of an eighth for one of a year old; of a ſeventh for the uſual age of inoculation; later, it is of a ſixth, fifth, fourth, and perhaps there are only two to one, which upon a wager could be laid for the life of him, who arrives at the age of thirty without having paid the fatal tribute.</p>
                  <p>The riſque of death one is expoſed to by waiting from nature for the fatal preſent of the ſmall-pox, is therefore of 9 to 70, that is, of more than an eighth: The riſque of dying by inoculation is computed at 1 to 376, by more than 6000 experiments. Hence it may be ſaid, that a father, in regard to his ſon, has only the option, either to inoculate him or not; here are two hazards to run, of which one is inevitable. By inoculating his ſon, againſt 375 fortunate events, one is to be dreaded; by not inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating him there is more than one to be laid againſt ſeven that he will loſe him; for, if out of 70 nine die, the bett will be of nine againſt 61, which is more than one againſt ſeven; ſo that, this laſt riſque being 50 times greater than the other, he cannot with reaſon heſitate in his choice.</p>
                  <p>This calculation is not exaggerated. Dr. Jurin, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing judged from his firſt enumerations, that, one year with another, there died a ſeventh of thoſe taken ill of the ſmall-pox, found on further and more exact information, firſt in 14,500, and afterwards in upwards of 17,000 perſons, that often one in five died, and commonly two in eleven; ſo that the peril of the natural ſmall-pox has not been exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerated by ſuppoſing one in ſeven. As to inoculation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the riſque of one againſt 375, as ſuppoſed, it is
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:012825_0025_0F8B41C317A1C248"/>
proved by the conſtant ſucceſs of this operation in the London ſmall-pox hoſpital, on perſons of all ages, that the peril of this method has rather by the calculation been augmented than diminiſhed.</p>
                  <p>Whatever might be the advantage of the artificial ſmall-pox, even though one ſhould not die in 10,000, I would not adviſe a father to ſubject his ſon to it, if he could be ſure that the natural ſmall-pox would ſpare him; but ſince, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a like revelation, which we want, the father has only the certainty of danger by far greater to which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes his ſon, in letting nature act, it is evident that reaſon counſels him, and that paternal tenderneſs requires, he ſhould diminiſh, as much as he poſſibly can, a riſque he cannot make void.</p>
                  <p>Such is the fate of humanity: Upwards of a third of thoſe who are born, are deſtined to die, in the firſt year of their life, by incurable diſeaſes, or at leaſt unknown: Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped from this firſt danger, the riſque of dying of the ſmall-pox becomes inevitable to them; it ſheds its influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on the whole courſe of life, and in every inſtant of time increaſes; it is a forced lottery wherein we find our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves concerned, in ſpite of us; each of us has a ticket in it, and the longer it delays coming out of the wheel, the more the danger augments. What is done by the practice of inoculation? The conditions of this lottery are changed; the number of fatal tickets is diminiſhed: One in ſeven, and in more favourable climates, one in ten was fatal, by the natural ſmall-pox: By inoculation, one in 300, one in 500, one in 1000, of which we have examples. All fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ages will envy ours this diſcovery: Nature decima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but art milleſimiſes us.</p>

               <p>HERETOFORE, to avoid entering into long diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, I reaſoned according to the ſuppoſition that there was ſome riſque in the practice of inoculation, and I confined myſelf to prove that this riſque was ſo ſmall, compared with that incurred by the natural ſmall-pox, that it may be deemed, as of no account. And, indeed, the riſque of one in 300, 500, or 1000, is not of the ſame kind, and ſtill leſs than that to which one is daily expoſed voluntarily and without the leaſt neceſſity. Some uſe violent and dangerous exerciſes, ſuch as hunting, riding poſt on horſeback, playing at tennis, &amp;c. others traverſe the ſeas, and have frequently certain death before their eyes. Shall it be ſaid, that it is allowable to hazard one's life habitually out of curioſity, paſtime, humour, or at beſt through a motive of convenience or pecuniary intereſt; and that it is criminal, I will not ſay to run once a very ſmall riſque in the view of preventing a great danger, but to convert a great riſque which cannot be annhiliated, into one 10, 20, 30, &amp;c. times leſs? Such is the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence the adverſaries of inoculation are reduced to, and that, ſuppoſing even that it is not exempt from all danger: What would it be if the pretended riſque was abſolutely nothing, as ſeveral eminent phyſicians are of opinion, and as ſome propoſe to make it evident?</p>
               <p>As I ſhall not engage in a diſſertation on a ſubject, which, in order to be well treated, would require a profound knowledge both in the theory and practice of phyſic, I ſhall confine myſelf to ſimple reflections. What can be the danger of inoculation? Is it in the operation or in its effect?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>New Objection.</hi> It is in both: A purulent matter, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from a body infected with a dangerous diſeaſe, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:012825_0027_0F8B41C41EB18B40"/>
into the blood of a ſound perſon. Muſt not this create horror? A like cauſe cannot fail of producing a pernicious effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Let us not take words for things: Let us leave to children puerile niceties, and let us remember that if reaſon had not triumphed over prejudices, and the natural repugnancy the diſſection of a human body inſpires, all the diſorders anatomy has diſcovered remedies for, would be incurable. Is not nature ſhocked at the ſight of the amputation of a limb, the perforation of the thorax in the empyema, cutting for the ſtone, the trepan, &amp;c. All theſe operations are very cruel, their ſucceſs very doubtful, and the danger of dying very great; yet they are confidently practiſed every day: What a prodigious difference between them and inoculation!</p>
               <p>I made a diſtinction between the operation and effects of inoculation. As to the operation, it has nothing terrible or dangerous. A ſuperficial inciſion on the ſkin differs from a ſcratch only, in that the latter would be more pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: But will it be ſaid that one can die of a ſcratch?</p>
               <p>As to the effects of the operation, experience decides what they are. I ſhall not endeavour to examine whether the contagious venom of the epidemy is only in the air that is breathed, that is, in an exterior cauſe; from whence it would follow that the choice of a ſubject which furniſhes the matter of inoculation is indifferent: All I ſhall obſerve is, that, ſince the choice not only of a ſubject, but alſo of the moſt benign and beſt conditioned ſmall-pox can be made, thoſe who chuſe it ſuch, cannot be cenſured for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting in the veins of a ſound man the produce of a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous illneſs. Beſides, it is proved by the experience of ſeveral ages, as well in Aſia as Africa, and of near an age in Europe, that, in the hands of an able practitioner, the danger vaniſhes by the choice of a ſubject, by preparation, &amp;c. that inoculation occaſions only a ſimple ſmall-pox, which gives vent to the greateſt part of the venom through the inciſions, and which therefore is ſcarce ever confluent,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:012825_0028_0F8B41C4DD157EE0"/>
but always more benign than the natural. It is moreover proved, that it leaves no marks, and that it is not attended with the fever of ſuppuration, ſo common and ſo fatal in the natural ſmall-pox. Can any thing more be wanting to conclude, that the life of a patient is ſecured in the inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated ſmall-pox by the preſcribed precautions, and that the accidents which might have attended it in a very ſmall number of caſes, ought to be attributed to foreign cauſes? Is it not evident by the laws of probability, that, among thouſands of inoculated ſubjects, ſome one may and ſhould die, not only forty days after, but in the week, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps on the day, by the ſame reaſon that this perſon might pay the tribute to nature eight days, one day, or one hour befors the operation? Inoculation prevents the dangers and conſequences of the natural ſmall-pox; but it is not therefore a remedy againſt all the diſorders incident to ſo complex a machine as the human body, and ſtill leſs a preſervative againſt ſudden death.</p>
               <p>In order to remove all impediments thrown in my way by the quibbles of the adverſaries of this mothod, I found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all my calculations on ſuppoſitions made as they fancied themſelves; but it is now time to lay in my claim to truth. Let us then firſt retrench, from the number of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended victims of this operation, thoſe who die of foreign accidents, as, for inſtance, children at the breaſt, ſuddenly cut off, in the courſe of a very benign ſmall-pox, by a convulſion or cholic, which happens but too frequently to other children of their age, who ſeem to enjoy the beſt ſtate of health; let us not lay to the account of the artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſmall-pox the death of thoſe, who, in a time of epidemy, have already received the diſtemper by the natural conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, before they were inoculated: This may well be preſumed, when the ſymptoms appear before the time when it is uſual with the operation to produce its effect. Let us alſo except, as it is juſt, on one ſide, the deaths occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by intemperance, or other exceſſes the patients were ſubject to; and, on the other, the accidents which ought

viſibly to be attributed to the imprudence of inoculators in making trials; theſe accidents are now more rare, but were frequent enough when the method was firſt intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. When all theſe exceptions are made, of which we hitherto made none, there will not remain perhaps a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle perſon whoſe death can be properly imputed to ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation.</p>
               <p>Make choice of a ſound, young ſubject, and of a good conſtitution; let a ſkilful phyſician be careful in prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him; preſerve him from the epidemical contagion; inoculate him; his life is ſafe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſt Objection.</hi> It is ſuppoſed that inoculation of itſelf is never mortal, but it may be ſaid, that he who might not have died perhaps of the natural ſmall-pox till the age of fifty, after having had children, after having ſerved his country, would be loſt for ſociety, if he died in his infancy of the inoculated ſmall-pox.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> This objection is more ſpecious than ſolid, being grounded on the ſuppoſition of the real danger of inoculation; it will be therefore unneceſſary to animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert upon its weakneſs, even the caſe of inoculation being not abſolutely without danger: It is clear that even then the great inequality of riſques in the natural and artificial ſmall-pox, the uncertainty as to the time of life in being attacked by the former, and the danger of dying ſo much the more great, as age is more advanced, are ſo many deciſive reaſons in favour of inoculation.</p>
               <p>What has been already mentioned, that the ſmall-pox deſtroys, mutilates, or disfigures the fourth of mankind, may be taken for an exaggeration; but I mean the fourth of thoſe who ſurvive the firſt diſeaſes of infancy: This may appear from the following reflections.</p>
               <p>Towards the end of the 16th century, about 50 years after the diſcovery of Peru, this diſtemper was brought from Europe to Carthagena in America; it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran the whole continent of the new world, and, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Quito alone, deſtroyed upwards of 100,000 In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians. This remark has been taken from an antient ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:012825_0030_0F8B41C65C92BE38"/>
of the cathedral of that city. In the Portugueſe colonies the ſmall-pox proved fatal to all the original in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the country. M. Maitland, to whom England is indebted from the uſe of inoculation, relates that there are years when the ſmall-pox is a kind of plague in the Levant, which kills at leaſt the third of thoſe it infects; this terrible proportion is not rare in Barbary. If we conſult Dr. Jurin's liſts, or thoſe annexed to his work, among others, Dr. Nettleton's, who informed himſelf in ſeveral towns from houſe to houſe of the number of the ſick and dead throughout the year (the ſureſt way of being exact) it will be ſeen that at London, and in other parts of England, there died ſome years a fifth, and ſometimes more of thoſe taken ill of the ſmall-pox; but among thoſe who do not die of it, how many remain deprived of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſight, intirely or partly! How many affected in the breaſt and lungs, languiſhing, valetudinarians, maimed! How many others, disfiguared for life by deformed ſeams and ſcars, become objects of horror to thoſe that approach them! Laſtly, in the ſex where comlineſs is ſo great an advantage, how many loſe their charms, ſome the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their huſbands, others the hopes of being ſettled in the world, whence a real loſs accrues to the ſtate.</p>
               <p>The ſmall-pox raiſes a tribute of a fourteenth on man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and, though the number of victims wounded by its darts ſhould not ſurpaſs the number of thoſe it ſtrikes mortally, it will notwithſtanding be always true, that, out of 100 perſons who have eſcaped the firſt dangers of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, thirteen or fourteen are cut off by this diſtemper, and that a like number exhibit in themſelves, during their whole life, all the diſagreeableneſs of its diſmal conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. There are then, in 100 perſons, 26 or 28 witneſſes to prove that this plague deſtroys or degrades the fourth of mankind.</p>
               <p>The number of experiments already cited demonſtrates that inoculation prevents all theſe calamities. The ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated ſmall-pox is not only neither mortal nor danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:012825_0031_0F8B41C98205FD78"/>
but it leaves nothing after it that might make it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered with regret; this conſideration alone ſeems deciſive for that half of mankind, to whom beauty in a great meaſure is ſometimes dearer than life. The aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing contraſt, M. Maty ſays, that may be obſerved in viſiting the ſmall-pox hoſpital, between the inoculated, and thoſe who had the natural ſmall-pox, in regard to the effects of the diſtemper on the face, would be alone ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to determine thoſe who make ſome account of the advantage of not being disfigured.</p>
               <p>Theſe are not conjectures hazarded by a ſyſtematic genius: They are the reſult of facts diſcuſſed contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and publiſhed in the face of the world by learned di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, ſkilful phyſicians, and able ſurgeons; they are war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted, and have received a ſufficient ſanction from the great names and authority of Sydenham and Boerhaave; the Biſhop of Worceſter; Dr. Jurin, Secretary to the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Society; Dr. Mead, the Engliſh Hippocrates; and M. Ranby, firſt Surgeon to his Britannic Majeſty.</p>
               <p>Prudence adviſed and directed that too much precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſhould be guarded againſt in adopting a deluſive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty; it was neceſſary that time ſhould throw a new light on its utility: Upwards of thirty years experience has cleared up all doubts, and perfected the method; the liſts of thoſe that died of the ſmall-pox have diminiſhed by a fifth in England, ſince the practice of inoculation became more common; it is a truth that ſeems no longer conteſted in London, that the inoculated ſmall-pox is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely leſs dangerous than the natural, and that it preſerves from it. Heretofore in England this operation was bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly inveighed againſt, but now it has not one enemy that dares to attack it openly: The evidence of facts, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the ſhame of maintaining a forlorn cauſe, have ſhut up the mouths of its moſt paſſionate adverſaries.</p>

            <p>"HAVING well conſidered the ſubject of inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the ſtate of the laws reſpecting it in this Colony, and likewiſe conſidering what great improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have been made in Europe and America, in the management of both, the natural, and artificial ſmall-pox, ſince them laws were enacted: Thought it highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable if it could be made appear that inoculation might be practiſed at the peſt-houſe at Middletown, with ſafety to the public we might be indulged. Now it is a known fact that when, ſome years ſince, inoculation was practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at ſeveral hoſpitals in this government, the public ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by its being communicated from almoſt every hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital. I have this to ſay in favour of our being indulged at Middletown, that near three hundred perſons have had the diſeaſe at our peſt-houſe, without one inſtance of the diſorder being communicated from ſaid houſe. Farther, I believe any perſon of ſenſe, will allow, that it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that betwixt October and May ſeſſions, a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number of perſons may have the ſmall-pox at Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town peſt-houſe much to their intereſt and peace of mind without the government being in the leaſt expos'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. We will allow it poſſible the ſmall-pox may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated from ſaid houſe; can any perſon be ſo unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable as to deſire I ſhould be prohibited from taking the ſmall-pox, which I conceive will be much to my inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and peace of mind, becauſe that it is poſſible he may in ſome extraordinary way be expos'd to it, contrary to the greateſt probability? Ought a mere poſſibility of my acting being injurious to my neighbour to prevent my acting, when it is apparent that my acting will be much to my intereſt and I ſtand ready to give him all the ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he can deſire that my conduct ſhall not injure him, and
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:012825_0033_0F8B41CADF189240"/>
if it does that I will pay all reaſonable damages? In moſt of our concerns in life we are obliged to act on probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, now I think it may be made appear, that it is as probable that I, with a number of my neighbours may have the ſmall-pox at the peſt-houſe in Middletown, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſingle inhabitant of ſaid town being injured there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, as it is probable that a man could ride from New-Haven to Hartford in a given time, (viz.) 10 hours. I now beg it as a favour of the Government, that I with a number more, (who two years ſince, ſolicited the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for liberty to ſuffer inoculation at the peſt-houſe in Middletown, our phyſician being our inoculator) may be inoculated as above. We ſtand ready to give bond, for our prudent conduct, are willing to be under the inſpection of a committee, or the authority and ſelect men of ſaid Middletown, as the legiſlative ſhall think proper. It is, I believe, evident that a greater number of people have ſuffered the natural ſmall-pox in this government con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of inoculated patients coming from abroad with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being duly cleanſed, than from an internal inoculation. <note n="*" place="bottom">I myſelf was knowing to about ſixty people having the ſmall-pox two years ſince in this government, conſequent of ſome perſons coming from inoculation abroad, without being duly cleanſed.</note> Numbers of the inhabitants of this colony within this ſix years have been inoculated at Euſopus, Poughkeepſie, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walk, and New-York, and have traverſed the government with infected apparel endangering the public, which dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger will be greatly leſſened, if not wholly removed, by a well regulated internal inoculation.</p>
            <p>Farther, I think when it is conſidered what great ſums of money are yearly ſent to New-York, to pay them for importing for us Engliſh goods, it will be an inducement to indulge us in our requeſt, to be inoculated at home, when it may be demonſtrated that we can be inoculated at home with greater eaſe, leſs expence <note n="†" place="bottom">I have known ſeveral young gentlemen, who procuring inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion abroad, have been expos'd from 10 to 20 pounds expence.— We judge inoculation will not coſt us more than three pounds a head, if indulged in our preſent requeſt.</note> and vaſtly more ſafety to the community.</p>

            <p>I Have read over the hiſtory of inoculation for the ſmall-pox, you put into my hands, with pleaſure; the author, I think has fully refuted the arguments againſt the practice, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>uced from the tophics of religion and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality; and there remains no reaſonable objection againſt the admiſſion of the full and free uſe of it, as the nobleſt and beſt preſervative againſt the ravages of that fatal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper in thoſe Countries, where it prevails without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, eſpecially if we take into conſideration the great improvements made in the practice of inoculation ſince Monſieur La Condamine wrote; but as you deſired my ſentiments, whether it could be prudent to introduce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculation for the ſmall-pox (if permitted by law) to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral uſe in this colony, I freely anſwer I think it would not.</p>
            <p>The ſtate of this colony is ſuch, that the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Inhabitants in it may for ſome time yet to come, probably paſs thro' life without being expos'd to that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and ſurely thoſe who are in no danger, want no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity againſt danger, but were inoculation ſet up and practiſed by every phyſician, in every place they thought proper, it would lay every one under a neceſſity to inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, or ſtand expoſed to the diſtemper in the natural way, the former would load the colony with a great and unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary expence, which ſhe is liable to bear; the latter would be attended with ſtill greater expence, and would beſides hazard the lives of numbers, eſpecially of the old and infirm and valetudinary. I am therefore fully perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the indiſcriminate practice of inoculation here would be hurtful to us, and that the legal reſtraints it now lies under are in the main, founded in good policy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35"

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>At the ſame time I freely confeſs to you I could hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily wiſh that the legiſlature would be pleaſed ſo far to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with the preſent act againſt inoculation, as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to be practiſed in ſome preſcribed place in each county, by approv'd phyſicians under the inſpection of ſome gentlemen capable to direct the due management of the hoſpitals, and guarded with ſuch regulations as ſhall appear neceſſary to prevent the infection's being communicated from the hoſpitals.</p>
            <p>This would ſave a great expence of money now carried out of the colony, and ſave to the inoculated the coſt of a long journey, which is greater than the coſt of inoculation after the journey is made—it would put in the power of parents who intend their children for ſuch trades and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions as will expoſe them to the ſmall-pox, to give them the diſorder when young, by which nearly all the remaining danger in inoculation will be avoided—and as government could have the whole under their immediate direction, the danger from perſons returning from inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation not well cleanſed, or with remaining infection upon them will be greatly leſſened, if not wholly avoided.</p>
            <p>'Tis true the ſmall-pox has been ſpread from the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals for inoculation, which were ſome years ago uſed in this colony, but that happened I believe, principally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no one had ſufficient powers, by law, to reſtrain pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients a competent length of time after their recovery from the diſeaſe.</p>
