      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>YOUR Importunity, and the Reaſons on which it is founded, have prevail'd upon me to publiſh theſe Diſcourſes, when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe could have overcome my Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Publication of them. I muſt confeſs that ſuch a publick Record of the Wonders of GOD's Power &amp; Mercy in your Settlement &amp; Increaſe to this Time, is but a proper Teſtimony of Gratitude to your great <hi>Preserver;</hi> and may be of Uſe to perpetuate the Memory thereof <hi>in your Families, and throughout your Generations, that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of them may not periſh from your Seed; but that the Generation to come might know them, even the Children which ſhould be born, who ſhould ariſe and declare them to their Children.</hi> With this moving Argument you have obtained my Conſent, and ſo you will clear me of the <hi>Odium of withholding more than is meet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having therefore this Teſtimony in your Hands, you may frequently review it, to ſee the Dealings of GOD with you and your Fathers, and your <hi>Calling</hi> to <hi>exalt him,</hi> and <hi>truſt</hi> in Him.

Alas! our Sufferings are not worthy to be compared with theirs, <hi>in the Days of their Pilgrimage;</hi> who were in Perils by Robbers, in Perils by their own Country Men, in Perils by the Heathen, in Perils in the Wilderneſs, in Perils in the Sea, in

Perils among falſe Brethren, in Wearineſs and Painfulneſs, in Watching often, in Hunger and Thirſt, in Faſtings often, in Cold and Nakedneſs: Why ſhould we then complain and murmur <hi>that the former Days were better than theſe?</hi> It is true, GOD may juſtly complain of us, that <hi>as we have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, ſo we have ſinned againſt him, and that from the Days of our Fathers we are gone away from his Ordinances and have not kept them.</hi> But yet <hi>he has not changed our Glory into Shame,</hi> nor <hi>taken his Kingdom from us.</hi> Our temporal Proſperity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe is an encouraging Argument that we are ſtill <hi>beloved for the Father's Sake,</hi> and for the Sake of the many Thouſands in this Land that <hi>fear God and think upon his Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am ſenſible of the Darkneſs and Difficulty with which ſome of the Affairs of Government are perplexed at this Time; <hi>the Province is in great Affliction,</hi> but yet <hi>we are not in Deſpair,</hi> ſo long as <hi>our wiſe Men that are among us are our Pilots, and rule with GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the revival of Religion among all Orders and Ages of Perſons, and particularly of a public charitable Spirit (which we ſhould all <hi>earneſtly covet</hi>) would greatly contribute to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate us from all our Difficulties and Dangers: for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Jeſus conſults the Proſperity of the State as well as of the Church; and the Practice of Godlineſs will ſerve the great Intereſt of both. For <hi>the Throne is eſtabliſhed by Righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs exalteth a Nation,</hi> but <hi>Sin is the Reproach and will be the Ruin of any People.

            <p>THIS Day compleats a Century ſince the Foundation of this firſt and ancient Church was laid. Memorable have been the interchangeable Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God towards it in this Period, as we may well ſuppoſe in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent mutable State of Things: But it hath ſurvived the various Changes of Time, <hi>according to God's Mercies, and according to the Multitude of his Loving kindneſſes. Having therefore
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:004367_0006_10044C50E6773AA0"/>
obtained Help of God, we continue unto this Day,</hi> a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of his ſparing Mercy under the viſible Decays of Piety among us; and have this happy Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity<note n="*" place="bottom">Upon the Lord's Day when the Adminiſtration of the Lord's Supper was attended, and the Church ſolemnly renewed the original Church Covenant. The Church was gathered on Monday <hi>Sept</hi> 16. 1639.</note> to commemorate and mention the Loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and Praiſes of the Lord, according to all he hath beſtowed on us in particular, and his great Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards his People in general, in the Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons both of Grace and Providence.</p>
            <p>Theſe Words are a devout Meditation and Expreſſion of God's great and unwearied Goodneſs to his Church, and the Praiſes due unto him for it. They were ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken either by the Church, or by the Prophet in their Name, and are written for our Learning, and if I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not, will afford us ſome pious Inſtructions and Reflections ſutable to the Buſineſs of this Day.</p>
            <p>Here I ſhall obſerve this important Truth as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the Senſe of the Text, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> That it has been the exemplary and pious Care of the Church of God to mention his Loving-kindneſſes, and Praiſes, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all that the Lord hath beſtowed on them in the Riches of his Mercy; to make a ſolemn Mention &amp; Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of the Riches of the divine Goodneſs, as indeed the Church of Chriſt on Earth, the Church Militant <hi>is full of his Riches.</hi> The Words of the Text are very empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and full to this Purpoſe; they abundantly expreſs the Memory of his great Goodneſs, they expreſs the greateſt Senſe and Acknowlegement of the Church of Iſrael, for the great Goodneſs which God had beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on them and on their Fathers, according to his Mercies, and according to the Multitude of his Loving-kindneſſes.</p>
            <p>In diſcourſing on this Subject I ſhall endeavour to ſhew, 1. That it is the Duty and hath been the pious Practice of God's People to preſerve and expreſs the Memory of his great Goodneſs to them. 2. It is alſo their Duty, and hath been their pious Care to expreſs the Praiſes of the Lord in Remembrance thereof.</p>

            <p>The planting and ſettling of Churches is the <hi>Work of the Lord that he may be glorified.</hi> God ſends his Goſpel into <hi>one Place of his Dominion,</hi> and not into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, affords to one Nation the Means of Salvation, and not to another, <hi>one Piece is rained upon,</hi> and made fruitful with the Doctrines of Grace and Salvation, <hi>and the Piece whereupon it raineth not, withers and is nigh unto Curſing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>This Church of Chriſt in particular ſhould do it this Day, <hi>Set up </hi> a Memorial of the divine Goodneſs, and <hi>mention the Loving-kindneſſes of the Lord, according to all that he hath beſtowed on us.</hi> This, this is the Day of the Gladneſs of our Heart, for <hi>God's manifold Mercies</hi> to us and to our Fathers, and if it be the Day of <hi>our Eſpouſals to Chriſt</hi> we ſhall have Cauſe enough to <hi>rejoyce in the Lord always with Joy unſpeakable;</hi> The Lord grant it may be ſo <hi>in his good Pleaſure</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a very proper Time to recollect, conſider and rehearſe <hi>what great Things God hath done for us,</hi> as a Church and People, and for every one of us in particular, that we may be ſutably prepared, diſpoſed and quickened to praiſe the Lord for them: Let us not neglect and miſs the happy Opportunity, but diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improve it to the Glory of God, and to our Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance in Chriſtian Knowlege, and practical God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It becomes the People of God to mention his great Goodneſs towards the Church in general. <hi>I will mention the great Goodneſs towards the Houſe of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, which he hath beſtowed on them.</hi> This indeed is a very copious Theme, and who is ſufficient to give the ſacred Hiſtory? <hi>Who can utter the mighty Acts of the Lord?

            <p>The Prophet, or the Church, whoever it is that ſpeaks here, doth not confine the Conſideration of the divine Goodneſs to themſelves of that Generation, but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly extends the Review of it to diſtant Ages of the Church that were paſt; and mentions his great Good<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004367_0010_10044BE1E531CE08"/>
to the Church in general: And indeed there is ſuch a ſummary of Church Hiſtory in the holy Bible from the Beginning of Time as may furniſh rich Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for our delightful Exerciſe in the Duties of Religion, both for Meditation, Praiſe and Diſcourſe. <hi>O how great is his Goodneſs</hi> which he hath beſtowed on the Church from Age to Age.</p>
            <p>As the Church of Iſrael were formed and preſerved by a Series of remarkable Providences, ſo God took Care to preſerve the Remembrance thereof in ſeveral Ways to the lateſt Poſterity. Particularly,</p>
            <p>Of their very remarkable Deliverance from the <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Bondage,</hi> and miraculous Preſervation in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs forty Years, till their Introduction and Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Land of Cannan. Theſe Things are ſo full of the Wonders of God's Power &amp; Mercy that they well deſerved to be commemorated and acknowleged <hi>in all their Generations,</hi> and indeed in all Ages of the Church.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, God commanded his People Iſrael to tranſmit the Knowlege of them down to all their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations: <hi>That one Generation might praiſe his Works to another</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Pſalm 73 <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </note>. <hi>That the Generation to come might know them even the Children which ſhould be born, who ſhould ariſe and declare them to their Children, that they might ſet their Hope in God, and not forget the Works of God, but keep his Commandments</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſalm 44. 1.</note> 
               <hi>We have heard with our Ears, O God, our Fathers have told us what Work thou didſt in their Days, in the Times of old.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was one wiſe and effectual Method God took to preſerve the Knowlege of his Will and Works in the Church of Iſrael, <abbr>viz.</abbr> PARENTAL INSTRUCTION.</p>
            <p>Moreover, God inſtituted ſeveral Memorials or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of his wonderful Works of Mercy to them. So the Paſſover was inſtituted <hi>in Remembrance of his Mercy</hi> in bringing them out of Aegypt, when he <hi>ſlew all the Firſt-born in Aegypt, a Night to be much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to the Lord in their Generations.</hi>

the Sacrifice of the Lord's Paſſover, who paſſed over the Houſes of the Children of Iſrael in Aegypt, when he ſmote the Aegyptians, and delivered our Houſes.</hi> Yea, ſo great was the Deliverance, that God hath preſerved the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of it in the Preface to the Decalogue or Moral Law, which <hi>is in theſe Words,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The Song of <hi>Moſes</hi> recorded in <hi>Exodus</hi> 15. is a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Memorial of the great Deliverance God gave them by the Deſtruction of the Hoſt of the Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in the Red-ſea.</p>
            <p>Their miraculous Preſervation in the Wilderneſs forty Years, where God fed them with <hi>Manna,</hi> and <hi>gave them of the Corn of Heaven, and they did eat Angels Food,</hi> was commemorated by the <hi>Golden Pot that had Manna,</hi> and was put in the Ark within the Vail<note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. 9. 4 Exod. 16 32; &amp;c.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In like manner, God was pleaſed to preſerve the Remembrance of his miraculous Work <hi>in dividing the Waters of Jordan</hi> for the Armies of Iſrael to paſs ſafely through, as on dry Land, by cauſing <hi>twelve Stones to be taken out of the midſt thereof, and ſet up in Gilgal for a Memorial</hi> forever<note n="‖" place="bottom">Joſh. 4 6, 7.</note> Thus <hi>God made his wonderful Works to be remembred,</hi> his wonderful Works to the Houſe of Iſrael, in that remarkable Period from their memorable Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> to their Introduction to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> which prepared their Way for their future Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment and Proſperity.</p>
            <p>As God hath had a Church in the World from the Beginning, ſo he hath taken ſpecial Care of its Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation

and Support: It is built upon Chriſt <hi>the Rock of Ages,</hi> ſo <hi>the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.</hi> The <hi>Burning Buſh</hi> is not conſumed. <hi>Many a Time,</hi> may the Church ſay, <hi>have they afflicted me from my Youth,</hi> yet <hi>they have not prevail'd againſt me.</hi> The World, the Fleſh and the Devil act in Confederacy againſt it, yet it ſtands ſecure againſt all the Aſſaults that have been made upon it, from Earth and Hell. The Lord is in the midſt of it, its Glory and Defence, <hi>For I, ſaith the Lord, will be unto her a Wall of Fire round about, and the Glory in the midſt of her</hi>

            <p>Sometimes the Glory of the Church has been made <hi>thin,</hi> and the true Worſhippers of God have been <hi>few</hi> in Number, yea <hi>very few.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Time of great Declenſion in the Church of of Iſrael, in the Days of the Prophet <hi>Elijah,</hi> he veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thought in himſelf that he <hi>only was left, and of the People there was none with him,</hi> that <hi>feared God, and thought upon his Name, no not one.</hi> But yet at that Time there <hi>was a Remnant left</hi>

            <p>But when Chriſt the Glory of his People Iſrael, was manifeſted to them, in the Fulneſs of Time, he ſpread the Knowlege of God and his Grace, <hi>preaching Peace to them that were afar off, and to them that were nigh,</hi> both to Jews and Gentiles: And gave it in Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Apoſtles to chriſtianize the whole World of Mankind, and preach the Goſpel to every Creature: So the Scripture was fulfilled<note n="‖" place="bottom">Iſai 9 1, 2. <hi>compared with</hi> Mat 4 14, 15, 16.</note>. <hi>The People which ſat in Darkneſs, ſaw great Light, and to them which ſat in the Region and Shadow of Death, Light is ſprung up.</hi> And thus Chriſt is a Light to lighten the Gentiles, as well as the Glory of his People Iſrael. The Gentiles came to his Light, and Kings to the Brightneſs of his Riſing: So the Church of Chriſt has commenc'd Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and Catholic.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of God in revealing Chriſt and the ſaving Doctrines of the Goſpel to the Church is <hi>very great; Surely God is good to Iſrael</hi>

We have heard with our Ears, O God, our Fathers have told us, what Work thou didſt for them in their Days, in the Times of old: How thou didſt drive out the Heathen with thy Hand, and plantedſt them, how thou didſt afflict the People, and caſt them out: For they got not the Land in Poſſeſſion by their own Sword, neither did their own Arm ſave them; but thy Right Hand and thine Arm, and the Light of thy Countenance, becauſe thou hadſt a Favour unto them.<note n="‖" place="bottom">Pſalm 44. begin.</note>

            <p>
               <hi>Thus God brought a Vine into this Land</hi> from a far Country, <hi>and caſt out the Heathen and planted it, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Room before it and did cauſe it to take deep Root, and it is filling the Land. She ſent out her Boughs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea, and her Branches unto the River. Return we beſeech thee, O God of Hoſts, look down from Heaven, and behold and viſit this Vine, and the Vineyard which thy Right Hand hath planted, and the Branch that thou madeſt ſtrong for thy ſelf: So will not we go back from thee,: Quicken us, and we will call upon thy Name. Turn us again, O Lord God of Hoſts, cauſe thy Face to ſhine, and we ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
