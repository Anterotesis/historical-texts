            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>"And Moses said unto the people, remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the Lord brought you out from this place."</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE period of any remarkable and interesting event, which concern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the essential welfare, or the political existence of a nation, is truly deserving of remembrance. The children of Israel once enjoyed great prosperity in Egypt; they dwelt in the best of the land, abounded in flocks and herds, as well as in every comfort which that fertile country afforded. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut through the ambition and avarice so prevalent in human nature, those who once favoured them soon became haughty oppressors; they deprived them of their property and rights, and kept them for many years under subjection to cruel task-masters. Their deliverance from this servitude <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the event, and the time when it was accomplished is the period referred to in the text, where it is said, "<hi>Remember this day in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</hi>"</p>
            <p>How parallel the words, and the circumstances, to the day, and the events, which we are now assembled to commemorate. On this day we ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the independence of our country; this is the day of her political existence among the nations of the earth, the day when she escaped from civil bondage, the aera of her liberty, prosperity and glory; a day pregnant with great events, and worthy to be remembered throughout all generations.</p>
            <p>This is the twenty-third Anniversary of our country's freedom; on this day three and twenty years ago, our representatives in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress assembled, declared these United States of America free and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, broke the bonds that united us to the mother country, and cast off the servile yoke, which degraded us to a state of dependence unworthy of freemen. To defend our invaded rights and privileges, to resist the iron hand of oppression stretched out against us, to preserve our liberties inviolate to the latest posterity, we rose in its defence, and appealed to the sovereign Ruler of the Universe for the justice of our cause, relying upon his protection and support in this time of trial, this critical and arduous contest, big with our infant country's fate. Glorious and important strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle! What spectacle more sublime and interesting, than a nation thus fighting in the cause of freedom, with this motto inscribed on her banners,

               </gap> contest, of the difficulties and dangers we encountered, of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> deliverance from national bondage, of our present invaluable privileges civil and religious, and of the obligations we are under to the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, who by strength of hand brought us out of our difficulties, and delivered us from the power of our enemies: For in the language of inspiration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "<hi>Had not the Lord been on our side, when men rose up against us, they had swallowed us up quick.</hi>" This then according to the text <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a day to be remembered, a day of deliverance, a day of thanksgiving, a day of joy, <hi>the birth day</hi> of our country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And we have the same reason to remember this day, as the Israelites had to remember that of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from Egypt; for we have experienced a separation and deliverance similar to their's, and accomplished by the same Almighty hand.</p>
            <p>This day, then, should be employed in considering the mercies and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Lord, the benefits and favours which he has bestowed upon our country, and in expressions of gratitude and praise to the Father of Light, the eternal and inexhaustible source of all our mercies, temporal as well as spiritual.</p>
            <p>But how different is the day often kept, and how absurd is the conduct of many upon it: Instead of gratitude and praise, they exhibit a scene of dissipation and folly; instead of a rational and thankful remembrance of God's benefits, they drown reason by intemperance, and banish gratitude by an abuse of his mercies.</p>
            <p>Our joy, therefore, should be regulated by the dictates of reason and religion, our mirth should be mixed with a fear of offending, and our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing should be in the Lord with trembling: For if we sin against that holy and all powerful God, who by strength of hand has delivered us out of our difficulties, and relieved us from our fears, he can easily make our blessings curses, or remove them far from us, and quickly involve us in all that misery which we dread.</p>
            <p>Indeed the late aspect of public affairs has been threatening, the alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prospect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of war has again been presented to our view, and peace for a while appeared about to take its flight from our borders. From this it seems as if the Lord still has a controversy with us for our sins; that the rod of his judgments is yet suspended over us; and dark louring clouds in our political horizon indicate an impending storm. This should teach us, while we rejoice for temporal blessings, to consider the source from whence they spring, our dependence upon God for their continuance, the obligations we are under to render him an acceptable service, and to guard against ingratitude and abuse of his favours.</p>
            <p>We should, therefore, strive to keep the day in a suitable and becoming manner, and we should remember it by having a deep and grateful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> down still greater blessings upon our country.</p>
            <p>As the events of the day, which we commemorate, are chiefly of a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical nature, we hope none will object to the introduction of politics in this discourse, from a mistaken notion that they have no connection with religion, and that the God of Providence has no concern in these affairs of men. For nothing but ignorance and illiberality can be the foundation of such reflections. It being evident to every enlightened and unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced mind, that as both reason and scripture require us to consider God as the author of our private mercies, and to give thanks for them, he is no less the source of our public political blessings; and we are under the strongest obligations publicly to acknowledge them, and render unto him the praise which is due unto his name.</p>
            <p>In prosecuting the subject, we propose,</p>
            <p n="1">I. To consider what is implied in remembering the day; which will lead us to mention some of those great and important events respecting our country, which on this occasion demand our remembrance.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Point out some of the duties, which naturally result from a recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of these events.</p>
            <p>And <hi>first.</hi> We are to consider what is implied in remembering the day, or to mention some of those great and important events respecting our country, which on this occasion demand our remembrance.</p>
            <p>Remembering the day evidently implies a recollection of those things which are most remarkable with regard to it, and were the occasion of its institution, together with all those subsequent events which proceed from it, are connected with it, and respect the same important end, our country's welfare. If we consider the subject in this point of light, the various public blessings of which we are made the subjects, and the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py circumstances in which we are placed, all rise at once and present themselves to our view. And nothing can be more suitable, more decent, and more profitable on this occasion, than a remembrance of the public blessings we enjoy, that we may see the abundant reasons we have for praising the Lord, and feel deeply impressed with a sense of our obligation to it: For thanksgiving is a continual duty, as we are daily receiving renewed mercies; and the inspired apostle directs that we should, "<hi>Give thanks always, for all things, unto God the father, in the name of the Lord.</hi>"</p>
            <p>And here the great event which first demands our attention on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, is, the Revolution which established our Independence.

            <p>But Great Britain was mistaken in the spirit that actuated Americans; they were not so easily to be deprived of their property and rights; they were not tamely to be reduced to a state so abject and servile; they were not without a manful and vigorous struggle for the support of liberty to be made, "<hi>hewers of wood and drawers of water,</hi>" to any nation under heaven; and the doctrine of passive obedience and non-resistance to ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and oppression was too gross and palpable a folly to meet with many admirers on this side the Atlantic. Resistance was therefore the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of their attempt to enforce their arbitrary exactions, and Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans indignant fly to arms. Now war with all its horrors descends upon our once peaceful shores, the vast ocean itself forms no barrier against its dire approach; for its wide surface is burdened with numerous ships, which hither waft the messengers and implements of death. See bands of foreign ruffians landing on our coasts; see how they cover all the shore; see murderous instruments arrayed, the thundering cannon, the destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive musquet, the pointed bayonet, the glittering sword, the polished spear; see martial banners displayed and long embattled ranks waiting the signal of combat with the sons of freedom, assembled to defend their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive land! The scene of slaughter commences, the roar of cannon and musquetry, the clashing of arms, the beating of drums, the cries of the wounded, the groans of the dying, ascend at once in mingled tumult and confuse the ear. Rank closes up with rank, the earth is tinged with pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple gore and strewed with human carcases. The king of terrors erects his bloody standard in the midst, and waves it triumphant over<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this scene of carnage; the grim tyrant with his destroying sword mows down whole ranks at once, regards neither youth nor age, spares neither virtue nor talents, cowards nor heroes, but with merciless look stalks through the field over heaps of slain, and scatters around him promiscuous destruction. Mark that band of heroes foremost in the fight, who lead the sons of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom on to battle. Melancholy scene! The rude destroyer makes a near approach to them, strides across their way, and brandishes his fatal dart. Then Warren, Montgomery, Mercer and other brave heroes fell. Oh! what a fall was that for you my country! If virtue, talents, courage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, humanity and love of country could have saved, you would not thus have fallen. Behold them, my countrymen! The glory of America has fallen in battle upon the high places; encircled in the arms of death they lie, and no kind friend at hand had they, to sooth their expiring mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: But children, wives and friends had they forsaken, to spill their blood in their beloved country's cause: Their mangled limbs, their bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wounds, their breathless bodies, are the costly sacrifices, which they

Yes, illustrious heroes, who fell in the cause of American liberty; your names shall live immortal in the annals of your country; they shall never be buried but in its ashes; one generation shall hand them on to another, till the end of time; and at each return of this anniversary of our country's independence, they shall be precious to the so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>And whilst on this day we celebrate our independence, let us thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the price we paid for it, even the best blood and treasure of our country. Imagine not my hearers that such descriptions are needless; for these scenes of woe, this bloody tragedy, were once serious realities, in which we were too nearly concerned to think them trifles, and we should not even now remain unaffected at their remembrance; for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we are deeply and feelingly impressed, with a sense of the evils and horrors of war, we can never sufficiently value the inestimable blessing of peace. Apathy, with respect to deliverances experienced, borders too much on insensibility: It is our duty frequently to recall to mind past times of difficulty and danger, and the signal mercies we have received, that we may be thankful for them, and be duly sensible of the different and happy circumstances in which we are placed. Happy change indeed; the storm of war is turned into the calm of peace; the lightnings cease to flash, the deep thunders to roll, the dark clouds are dissipated, and a bright day ensues: Peace with her balmy wings descends and drops her olive branch upon our coasts. Years of happiness and plenty have rolled on since our deliverance from civil bondage, and we have been long bask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the full sunshine of wordly prosperity, "<hi>sitting under our own vine and figtree, where there was none to disturb or make us afraid.</hi>" Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with a climate temperate and salubrious, with a soil luxuriantly fertile, producing abundantly the necessaries, conveniencies and comforts of life, with an immense and well watered territory, "<hi>a land of brooks and fountains of water, whose stones are iron, and, like Palestine of old, flowing with milk and honey.</hi>" Add to these natural advantages, the civil and religious privileges we enjoy, and where is the nation under Heaven so highly favoured, that is made the subject of such numerous and precious blessings, and that is under greater obligations of gratitude to God.</p>

               </gap>ne blessings we had obtained by our independence; to regulate, balance and define the powers of government, in such a manner, as to secure the rights, liberty and happiness of the people; and to concentrate the whole force of the union for internal and external defence. These important ends are happily attained under our present form of government, which employed for a considerable time the ablest statesmen of our country; which in its structure affords a display of wisdom and talents, unequalled perhaps in any nation, and which is the admiration of the most enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened politicians in the world.</p>
            <p>Perhaps a more difficult and weighty task cannot be undertaken, than to contrive a plan of republican government to suit the political genius and principles of a nation; to give the people their due share in its admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration; to establish its various branches, so that they shall be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently extensive to include, direct and superintend all their essential politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal interests, and to balance and limit the different departments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in such a manner, that they shall not clash, or one interfere with or assume the province of another. In ours, the powers are so defined, the departments are so circumscribed, and the checks so strong and properly disposed, as to answer these valuable purposes as far, perhaps, as human wisdom can ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; and to complete its merit, provides a remedy for its own defects.</p>
            <p>We ought, therefore, highly to value this excellent constitution, which is the safety, happiness and glory of our country; and we should stand by and defend this palladium of our liberty and independence, against all the attacks of internal or external foes. Indeed it must be gross ignorance and stupidity, or a deliberate and wicked intention, to oppose the prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and happiness of America, which excites any to slander or defame our government or its administration; for they are both the choice of the people; they are both endeared to us by experience and trial; they are both sanctioned and ratified by the express, the avowed, the public and repeated declarations of a great majority of the most wise, enlightened and patriotic legislatures, as well as individuals, throughout the Union. It is enough, then, to excite indignation in the breast of every true friend to his country, to see men professing a great concern for its welfare, who at the same time endeavour to promote disaffection to the government and its administration; and under the sacred garb of patriotism, like political assassins, conceal a dagger to plunge into its very vitals. <hi>O Washington!</hi> thy country's hero, glory and defence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Could not thy long tried services, thy hard earned laurels, thy disinterested patriotism, thy noble talents, thy distinguished virtues, which compelled even envious Europe to confer on thee the palm, could they not secure even thee from those shafts of malice, when, like a skillful pilot, thou didst direct the helm of state, and brought us safely through the storm, in spite of threatening rocks and quicksands?

A constitution like this, administered by men of such splendid virtues and talents, can never fail to command the attachment, venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and support of every judicious and enlightened mind, of all the friends of liberty, order and good government. And how great must our happiness in this respect appear, if we contrast it with the present French administration, and the situation of civil government in France; where men of the most abandoned character, the most ignorant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>principled wretches, taken from the very dregs of the people, and noted for the most diabolical cruelty, wickedness, dissipation, treachery and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue, have often been entrusted with the offices of government, and have exercised a tyranny that beggars all description. If to this we add the ease with which this great event, a change of constitution, has been effected among us, without civil broil or bloodshed, notwithstanding the great variety of opposite opinions and clashing interests, which must be concerned in such an extensive territory: If we also consider that a simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar change in France, has been the occasion of the most dreadful civil wars and scenes of more than savage cruelties and slaughter; has over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the very foundations of civil and religious society, broke through all the bonds of moral obligation, and instead of a mild republican govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as their professed object was, they have established a military des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potism, ten thousand times worse than the arbitrary monarchy which they destroyed, and have exchanged <hi>one</hi> for <hi>many</hi> tyrants! If we consider these things, and compare them with our own situation, it must appear even to the most thoughtless observer, that we are indeed a happy people; that the hand of the Lord has been with us for good in a way of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished mercy, and that we are under indispensable obligations to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and praise.</p>

But this proves, no doubt, the falsity of their professions, and pretended views; proves that the pinnacle of liberty is too elevated for them, and has turned their brain; indicates that their genius is too volatile and fluctuating for a republic; shews that their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign is changed, that they have abandoned the cause in which they first set out; and instead of establishing their own and other nations' liberties, as they pretend their object is, this is only the cloak with which they cover their more favourite and selfish, though dark and horrid design of universal plunder and domination. As to religion, it is evident, that the most daring and artful designs have been formed to exterminate it, if pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, from the face of the earth. A number of disorganizing, dissipated and licentious characters, headed by the leading infidel and atheistical philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers of France and Germany, have for a long time been engaged in it, and with astonishing success. By means of secret societies, combined in the same common but inglorious cause; trained to impiety, insensibility and licentiousness, and bound to secrecy by the most awful oaths and dreadful penalties; an extensive combination of persons and means has been formed against God and his kingdom; against all religion natural and revealed; and against all existing governments. The revolution in France has afforded an opportunity for this wicked fraternity to carry on their base designs: For the men who have been at the head of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and have had the principal direction of revolutionary transac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, have generally, if not universally been members of it: And they have employed their power, influence and authority, in promoting the horrid plan of destroying religion, and revolutionizing the world. The French rulers have frequently made the most artful, flattering and specious professions, that their design was to promote the cause of liberty, to des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troy tyranny and superstition, and to free the nations from oppression; but at the same time they have endeavoured to bring them to a state of the most abject slavery, oppressive tyranny and complicated misery. By destroying the bonds of moral obligation; by promoting a spirit of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, suspicion and disaffection to civil government; they introduce the most un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The policy of France has been to divide people from their governments; thus to weaken the strength of nations by civil dissention and party spirit, and pave the way for an easy conquest to themselves. This has been their inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable conduct; and it has proved but too successful with respect to many nations whom they have subjugated, and whose melancholy fate affords an awful warning to others, to shun this dangerous snare. That they have had the same ensnaring views and insidious designs with respect to us, is a truth too glaring now to be denied: For this purpose they have estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished these secret societies in America, and have influenced a number of our fellow-citizens to espouse their cause, and form a party in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; who, in conjunction with our foreign enemies, have endeavoured to

            <p>The publication of the dispatches from our envoys, and the President's<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wise and ample instructions to them, turned the scale of prejudice against France; opened the eyes of all who were not wilfully blind; produced a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>re general attachment to our own government, and disarmed opposition of its principal weapons against it. These publications plainly discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the base, intriguing, avaricious and treacherous designs of the French rulers, and the pacific and candid disposition of our own; that they had done every thing to promote peace and harmony, that was in their power, consistent with the honour, dignity and independence of the United States.</p>
            <p>Thus the way was prepared for greater union among the people, as well as in our public councils; a majority in Congress was obtained in favour of vigorous and defensive measures, and the preparations for war, which had long been retarded, were commenced. Provision is now made, for erecting fortifications; for raising and disciplining troops; for obtaining a supply of cannon, arms, ammunition and warlike stores; for building and equipping a navy; and for the defence of our merchantmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Have we not therefore reason to bless God that, in the course of his Providence, so great a change has been wrought in the public mind, and that in conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it, these wise and energetic measures have been taken, so conducive to our welfare, safety and defence: We have reason to thank him, that many have thus been brought to see things in a proper light; and that union, attachment to, and confidence in our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, with a determined resolution to support its measures, have been the happy effects.</p>
            <p>Another special reason we have for thankfulness is, that a way has been prepared by the faithless, plundering and daring conduct of France, for the dissolution of the treaty of alliance, by which we were connected with her, and on account of which we were subject to a variety of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, and exposed to many dangers. The present moral and political state of France, under the despotic sway of men of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> licentious principles, and abandoned morals, using the most artful means to sow among the nations, the seeds of sedition, revolt and revolution; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to subvert the christian religion, that in its stead they may promote the general spread of atheism, infidelity and profanity; renders it highly dangerous to have any political connection with that nat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>on: And indeed it is a melancholy truth, that our late intercourse with the French, and the inconsiderate and enthusiastic attachment of ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Further, when we consider the part which the President has acted on this trying occasion; his penetration in discovering the insidious designs of our enemies, and his precautions in guarding against them; his great and distinguished abilities, for his high and important office; his wisdom, integrity, prudence and firmness, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played on various occasions; we have abundant reason to be thankful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If to these things we add the appointment and acceptance of the illustrious and beloved Wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, to the command of our armies, at this important crisis, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail of our country's prosperity seems complete; and we are made to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice, equally, at our own happiness, and at the exalted height to which his condescension, in this respect, has raised his fame.</p>

               </gap> designs now carrying on for the overthrowing all religion, and reducing the nations under the sovereign controul of one despotic, arbitrary go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, headed by a set of wicked and abandoned infidels; can we then turn our minds to the great and interesting change, which has taken place, in the public mind and measures here, and those things which have led to it, <hi>by which</hi> we are enabled to guard against, and resist their base and treacherous designs; can we deliberately contemplate these and other things which have been brought to our remembrance, this day, without a deep and thorough conviction, that God hath indeed wrought wonderfully for us; without seeing and acknowledging his unsearchable wisdom and goodness, his great and distinguished mercy towards us, and feeling ourselves impelled to render him sincere and fervent praise.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I proceed briefly, to point out some of the duties, which naturally result from a recollection of these events.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First.</hi> Gratitude to God, the author of all our mercies, is a duty essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially necessary, and highly incumbent upon us: "<hi>For by strength of hand,</hi> says the text, <hi>the Lord brought you out from this place.</hi>" And it is the Lord alone that brings us out of all our difficulties; that defends us from the snares of our enemies, and provides a way for us to escape out of their hands; he cuts the bars of brass asunder, opens the prison doors, and sets the weary captive free: And when we consider the many and great deliverances we have experienced; the number and power of our enemies; the many stratagems, and insidious designs that have been formed against us, our own weakness and helplessness, the apparent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility, at times, of being able to extricate ourselves from the laba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynth which enclosed us; we may truly say, "<hi>by strength of hand the Lord brought us out of our troubles, and delivered us from the power of our enemies, even by his Almighty and out stretched arm.</hi>" Where is the nation on the globe that is more prosperous and more happy, more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured in its political and civil institutions, more blessed with temporal as well as spiritual privileges. We should, therefore, frequently recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the numerous and distinguished mercies, which the Lord has confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon us, and endeavour to be truly thankful for them. We should also recollect the many and aggravated sins we have committed in the face of these mercies; for ingratitude and abuse of God's goodness, disobedience, profanity, idolatry, dissipation and infidelity too much abound. It is our duty then to be truly humble on their account; and the goodness of God which we have so remarkably experienced, should have a tendency to lead us to repentance, and a suitable improvement of his mercies: In this way our land would become Emanuels, where he would delight to dwell; God would be in the midst of us for good; would be our strong tower and rock of defence, a wall of fire round about us, to preserve us from all our enemies, and he would cause that no weapon formed against us should prosper.</p>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Venice, Genoa, Sardinia, Geneva, Holland, Switzerland—all have fallen and perished in the fatal snare; distrusting and suspecting the views of their own governments, and confiding in the fair and deceitful promises of the French, they became divided among themselves, and thus all possibility and hope of union for defence being taken away, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came an easy prey to their enemies. This seems to be the main object and principal design of the French, to promote division and party spirit, among the people, and to wean their affections from their government: If they can succeed in this, their triumph is complete, the walls of defence are thrown down, and invasion immediately ensues. This they tried in America; and though defeated in the end, yet for a while were so success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as greatly to retard defensive measures, and to clog the wheels of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Let us then f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rmly believe this important and eternal truth, that if we are united we may stand, but divided we must fall; and let it produce its full conviction in our minds and upon our conduct. Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the great bond of union to a people: If we distrust it, and place no confidence in it, all is lost; there is no centre of union, information, or of action; no plan of safety, no measures of defence. Let us then cultivate affection and esteem for the government of our choice, and place the utmost confidence in it. If any thing be wrong, as no human system is perfect, and time frequently discovers errors, let us not despise and reject it, on that account; but use the means prescribed for a constitutional reform. As republicans we ought to have wisdom, virtue and good sense enough, to know and feel that the majority must govern; that the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers whom we have chosen, and they only, must direct our public affairs; and that if their views and measures are not conformable to our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we are more likely to be wrong than they, who are at the source of information, and have a combination of facts and circumstances, to influence their decisions, which to us are often out of sight. Let us strive to cultivate knowledge, that we may have enlarged views of our political concerns, and discern where our true interests lie. Let us beware of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, the disgrace of human nature, the enemy of civil society, and the ruin of republics. It is because we are ignorant of our political du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, of the nature and excellence of the civil institutions that we enjoy, that we undervalue, and disregard them, and do not give them our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most support. It is because we have too little of that virtue, which is the principle and spring of our government, that many are so unreasonably difficult, absurdly censorious, suspicious and seditious; so very backward to exert themselves in their country's service. Let us then endeavour to conform our disposition, sentiments and conduct to the genius of that form of government which we have chosen; let us cultivate republican principles, manners and habits, and make our country's welfare, the chief object of our pursuit; and let us banish these mean, unfounded suspicions and jealousies, which are the effects, too frequently, of criminal and wilful ignorance, of prejudice, envy or a levelling disposition, and which constitute

               </gap> events laid before us this day, is, a determined resolution to defend <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> liberty and independence.</p>
            <p>These, we see, have been attacked at different times, and in various ways; the most artful plans have been laid to ensnare, and divide, in order to conquer and subjugate us; and even a number of our fellow-ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens have been led to turn against the country which gave them birth, and to join a base, insidious foe. This shews the necessity we have to be constantly on our guard, and resolutely determined to defend our country, when occasion requires, both with our fortunes and our lives. Have they not already threatened, that we shall share the fate of Venice and Genoa, if we do not comply with their insolent, arbitrary and unjust demands. And shall we tamely sit upon our lees, and see our country plundered by these daring enemies of God and man? Shall we begrudge a part of our property, to defend the whole, or repine at the expense? Or shall we save it to reward the French, for the mild blessings of their better government, to pay their soldiers for conquering our country, for burning our villages and towns, for butchering our patriots, for plundering our houses, for desolating our farms, for violating our females, for destroying every vestage of that holy religion, which is our only hope. What bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter purpose then can our property answer, than to save us from these bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, horrid scenes; and why do any complain of taxes imposed for our defence against them? Shall we be backward even to venture our lives in such a cause? It will be desirable, it will be honourable, it will be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, to fall in the defence of our country, of our liberty, of our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of our property, families, wives and children. In this struggle we contend for all that is worth preserving, for all that is dear to man, and without which life itself must be a burden! We contend that our inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, rights and privileges, civil and religious, may descend to our children, that they may have these precious blessings handed down, pure and entire from us, and may be preserved from that system of civil and religious disorganization, which is the disgrace and ruin of human nature.</p>
            <p>Let us then animate ourselves, to a defence of our independence, on this day, sacred to its memory, by considering what it cost us. The years of anxiety and toil, the arduous and painful exertions; the scenes of plunder, desolation and burning; of misery and woe; of destruction and carnage; how much blood and treasure, how many precious and invalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble lives; here an affectionate father, there a dutiful and promising son, here a fond brother, there a near relative or friend! Can you contemplate this scene of suffering, and not be affected with it; can you consider these costly sacrifices, made to secure your liberties, and feel unconcerned or indifferent about them, feel willing to resign them even without a struggle to such sacrilegious, daring and insulting enemies?
