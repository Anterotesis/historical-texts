            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE following Pieces were written ſome Months ago, but the Publiſhing of them defer'd on Account of the frequent Prorogations of the Aſſembly, under whoſe Conſideration they were chiefly meant to fall. The Proſe Part ſufficiently explains its Deſign; but, to ſome, the Verſes may ſeem a needleſs Addition.</p>
            <p>The Author replies, that conſidering how long it has been ſadly neglected in this Province to give due Attention to the Concerns of Literature and Education, he thought it would be ſtopping far ſhort, if he laid down Propoſals for this Purpoſe, without endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring at the ſame Time to excite his Countrymen to a ſpeedy Execution of them. The moſt pathetic Manner of doing this, he judg'd, was by a Repreſentation of the happy State we might arrive to, upon the Suppoſition of our attending to our true Intereſts at preſent. Now, as a Proſpect without ſome Variety and Colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can't take the Eye; and as the anticipating diſtant glorious Scenes naturally warms the Fancy, diſtends the Soul, and raps it into the Enthuſiaſm of <hi>Poetry;</hi> he hopes, 'twere needleſs to trouble Gentlemen of Taſte with any other Apology, for his Choice of this Species of Writing.</p>
            <p>The Thought upon which the Poem chiefly turns, tho' a plain Maxim in Politics, will perhaps ſtartle ſome narrow Minds; but the found Politician will no more be ſurpriz'd at it, than the learn'd Phyſician, if told that his Patient of 50 cannot live 50 Years more. Our Writers at Home ſpeak without Reſerve of the Death of the Britiſh Monarchy. Thus the amiable <hi>Prior:</hi>

                  <l>Rever'd and happy, long ſhall ſhe remain,</l>
                  <l>Of human Things, leaſt changeable and vain.</l>
                  <l>Yet all muſt with the general Doom comply,</l>
                  <l>And this great glorious Power, tho' laſt, muſt die.</l>
               </q>
The Poet means laſt of all the Empires of the Eaſtern World; for a little above he makes <hi>Solomon,</hi> in whoſe Mouth he puts theſe Words, declare that <hi>America</hi> was then folded from human Eye: and this agrees exactly with our Hypotheſis. One Author has even pretended to ſhew how long the <hi>Britiſh Conſtitution</hi> can ſubſiſt; but this being one of the ARCANA of Heaven, ſuch Speculations are idly curious. Another<note n="*" place="bottom">Hume'<hi>s Moral Eſſays.</hi> No 9.</note> has enquired whether a <hi>Republic</hi> or <hi>abſolute Monarchy</hi> would be its eaſieſt Death, its true EUTHANASIA; and, by a Piece of beautiful Reaſoning, ſhewn that the latter, which in all Probability will be its Fate, is much rather to be wiſh'd for.

And, as <hi>Machiavel</hi> obſerves, 'tis almoſt impoſſible to maintain a free Government among a corrupt People; for thoſe good Laws, thoſe faſt Patriots, who are the <hi>Pillars of Liberty</hi> among a <hi>virtuous People,</hi> become deſtructive of it when their Genius is grown cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt: Thus the rigid Stiffneſs of <hi>Cato,</hi> inſtead of preſerving the <hi>Freedom,</hi> haſtened the <hi>Slavery</hi> of the <hi>Romans;</hi> for he knew not to make the leaſt Allowance for a crazy Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>That great Politician and Maſter of all polite Learning, Lord <hi>Bolingbroke,</hi> thinks that Nothing can give a ſaving Turn to the ruſhing <hi>Britiſh Genius,</hi> but ſome extraordinary Conjuncture of ill Fortune or of good; which may purge, yet ſo as by Fire.—True, to ſuch Purgings and Convulſions it is, that <hi>Britain</hi> owes her preſent Freedom and Grandeur; but then they happened in other Times,

They happened in the Reign of weak Princes, when there were brave Patriots who knew how to improve thoſe lucky Occaſions, by obliging the Kings to give back whatever had been illegally uſurp'd from the People, and by drawing back the Government to its fundamental good Principles; in ſhort they happened when the Conſtitution was able to bear them:—but ſhould it happen that ever an ambitious enterprizing Prince fills the Throne,—one that is wicked and crafty enough to take the Advantage of the viſible

Decay of the ancient Engliſh Spirit, it is eaſy to foreſee that the Scales muſt be turn'd, and I tremble even to think of the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.</p>
            <p>But here it will be aſk'd, why alarm us with Dangers ſo ſeemingly diſtant?—For this very Reaſon, becauſe it is diſtant; was the Danger near, Alarms would be in vain. Have Patience I will explain myſelf.</p>
            <p>The ſame Analogy of Reaſoning, which ſhews us that all Governments are ſubject to Death, ſhews alſo that theſe Provinces may ſurvive their Mother Country:—Here again, methinks, I hear the ſame Cry as againſt every other Effort to improve the Spirit of <hi>Liberty and Virtue;</hi>—what ſhake off our Allegiance and become independent? No: I'm far from thinking it will ever be our Intereſt, or in our Power, to be independent of <hi>Britain,</hi> while ſhe is able to maintain her own Independency; but ſhould ſhe ever fall into the Way of other Nations, it is not to be ſuppoſed that we, like the chief Favourites of Eaſter.. Tyrants, would contentedly ſuffer ourſelves to be laid in the ſame Grave with her; this is a Teſt of Affection which ſhe will never require, and which, I hope, but a few here wou'd be diſpos'd to give. Indeed, ſo far from being in a Condition to ſhake off our Dependency, in my ſincere Judgment, we cou'd not at preſent even ſubſiſt in an independant State.—We are as deeply immerſed in Luxury as our Mother Country, little reflecting that the Food of Men is not Meat for Babes; ſo that were ſhe to fall at preſent, we muſt inevitably fall with her. But, Thanks be to Heaven, we ſeem ſecure in a long Succeſſion of Princes, whoſe Family have ever reckon'd it their greateſt Glory to be the Patrons of Freedom, and to ſave a degenerate World from univerſal Slavery even againſt their Will.—We ſhould then be greatly cautious to make a proper Uſe of thoſe golden Moments, which will not always laſt. If we do ſo, then whenever a <hi>gallic,</hi> or <hi>home-born Tyrant</hi> ſhall ariſe (and ſooner or later ſuch will ariſe) threatning to lay <hi>Britain,</hi> the Belov'd of Heaven, the Pride of Earth, the Iſle of Heroes and Freedom, in the Duſt, if our Aſſiſtance can't avert the Blow from her, we ſhall at leaſt be able, at this Diſtance, to avert it from ourſelves, and open an Aſylum to the noble Gleanings of her brave Sons who ſpurn the Yoke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—But if we neglect this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Opportunity of purging the Fountain, by making a laſting Proviſion for educating a Succeſſion of true Patriots and Citizens, it may ſoon be too late; and tho' there was no Danger of being ſurprized in this State of Indolence, we ourſelves will ſoon be in no Capacity even to think of a Reformation of Manners; for let us remember, that if once Corruption<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which treads cloſe on the Heels of Luxury, gets Footing amongſt us, all the Art of Man cannot, and Heaven will not, <hi>ſave us.</hi>

To illuſtrate, and make the proper Uſe of theſe Thoughts, is the Deſign of the following Poem; which I thought neceſſary to explain thus at large, that ſo there may be no Room left for a ſiniſter Conſtruction. I hope the Reaſoning will be found con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected; and the Principles upon which it is built I have partly juſtified by the beſt Authorities. As there is a large Field open, I might have given ample Range to Fancy: I might alſo have rais'd the Diction in ſeveral Places; but all my Deſign was to communicate briefly a few important Truths, ſo as readily to ſtrike an ordinary Reader.—As I have a greater Ambition to be thought a good <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> than a good Writer; I hope, far from harboring the leaſt unfavourable Thought of my native Country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have ſhewn a laudable Partiality to it; and indeed the ſtronger this Partiality is, the ſtronger too will be the Apprehenſion of every Danger wherewith ſhe may be affected: I wou'd fondly believe the Period of her Fall is yet very remote; but while it remains uncertain, all my Arguments will be concluſive.</p>
            <p>As I addreſs to the Aſſembly, a particular Addreſs to Mr. JONES is but a juſt Compliment to their late prudent Choice of a Speaker, tho' other Circumſtances did not challenge it; and, having once mentioned Him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I could not forbear adding a few Lines to encourage him to continue ſtedfaſt in the good Cauſe he has engag'd in: For I have ſeen Him, and Him alone by Name, treated in a very ungenteel and ungenerous Manner in ſeveral Pamphlets, and that for nothing elſe but his ſuperior Zeal to preſerve a juſt Balance between the Branches of the Legiſlature, and to preſerve the juſt Privilege of Aſſemblies. A Man, leſs a PATRIOT than he, would ſcorn to throw away his Labors in Return for ſo much Ingratitude; but, <hi>contra audentior ibat,</hi> he has eſteem'd it mean and inglorious to exchange a Scene of great and generous Efforts in public Life for private Eaſe or Intereſt; and therefore it ſhould be the Part of every honeſt Man, to encourage and ſupport him in this laudable Reſolution; and not only him, but ſeveral other worthy Gentlemen of the Aſſembly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—who, having ſignaliz'd themſelves, in the Worſt of Times, by their ſteady Attachment to their Country's Intereſt, have been as unworthily us'd as he: To all ſuch I wou'd be underſtood to apply what I have ſaid on <hi>Patriotiſm,</hi> tho' I have not thought my ſelf at Liberty to name them, ſince I have never ſeen them attack'd under their proper Names<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>A Difference between the Branches of the Legiſlature is a natural Conſequence of <hi>Liberty:</hi> All Men are fond of Power; and, where the Diſpute is handled with Good-Manners, Temper and Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, it gives me Pleaſure to hear the miniſterial Party accuſe the People of Licentiouſneſs; and the People, in their Turn, accuſ
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:006935_0008_102A9B8862F14060"/>
their Governors of ſtretching the Prerogative beyond due Bounds; this is a certain Indication that neither Side ſpeaks wholly true that the Balance has juſt Play, and <hi>Liberty</hi> is in no Danger. But when I hear the Writers of either Side, running into Scurrility and perſonal Satyr, and creating Ill-Blood among Fellow-Citizens, for what muſt neceſſarily happen in this State of Imperfection, where Men by their very Differences and Weakneſſes, are accommodated to one another and link'd together, it raiſes my Indignation to the higheſt Pitch, and I look upon ſuch Scriblers as the <hi>Bane of Society, and only fit for a Halter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I will conclude, having proceeded far enough on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, perhaps, to draw Ill-Will on my ſelf: For as Doctor <hi>Swift</hi> juſtly obſerves, One will get more Ill-Will by being the Author of a particular Encomium, than of a general Invective; but, if the Doctor's Reaſon for this, is not itſelf, a Satyr on human Nature, I apprehend none from any Gentleman that has the Honor of a Seat in the Aſſembly: And, far from regarding the Cenſure, I ſhould think myſelf reproach'd by the Applauſe of thoſe who praiſe or blame as Intereſt directs. I feel a very different Satisfaction, in bearing Teſtimony to Truth, from what they muſt feel, who never had the Goodneſs of Heart and honeſt Impartiality to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend <hi>Worth,</hi> nor Wit enough to vent their mercenary Spleen againſt it without perſonal Abuſe.</p>
            <p>As to theſe Papers, they are entirely ſubmitted to the Candor and Judgment of the Public; to which I ſhould pay but a ſorry Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment, if I did not declare, that I have done all in my Power, to make them in ſome Sort worthy of the Subject. Faults<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> however, they muſt have; but, Partiality being none of them, I hope they will be look'd upon as the real Sentiments of a Heart that ſcorns to entertain a Thought repugnant to what appears our general Good: There is not perhaps, any one Perſon in this Province more detach'd than I am, from the different Parties that have ſo long divided it; Intereſt, Health and Inclination, concur to call me from it quickly, but if theſe Papers can any Way anſwer the good Intent of Writing them, I ſhall think, I have not ſeen it altogether in Vain: And tho' Providence may ſoon place me at too great a Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The great Sages and Legiſlators of Antiquity, were ſo ſenſible of this, that they always made it their prime Care to plant Seminaries, and regulate the Method of <hi>Education;</hi> and many of them even deign'd, in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to be the immediate Superintendants of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Youth, whom they juſtly reckoned the riſing Hopes of their Country.</p>

ſays, that no ſooner was the Breath out of <hi>Numa'</hi>s Body, than the whole Aim of his Life and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was revers'd; the Temple of <hi>Janus</hi> was thrown open, and <hi>Italy</hi> became one Scene of Havoc and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation; ſo that the fineſt and juſteſt Conſtitution in the World could not ſubſiſt, even the ſmalleſt Moment, becauſe it wanted that Cement in it, which ſhould have kept all firm together; namely, <hi>good Rules for the Education of Youth.</hi> However this be, certain it is, that thoſe Societies, whoſe firſt Lawgivers included Education in the Idea of Government, and thought it the Baſis and very Soul of their Work, to contrive good Laws or Plans for this Purpoſe, always grew up quickeſt, and flouriſhed longeſt in a State of <hi>Liberty</hi> and glorious <hi>Independency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence I have often wondered, that this Province ſhould have been near a whole Century, in the Hands of a civilized and enlightned People; and yet, not one public Seminary of Learning planted in it; where the Taſte and Manners of our Youth may be formed; where they may be taught (<hi>quid Verum atque Decus</hi>) the Knowledge and Practice of <hi>Virtue;</hi> and where, without being beholden to our Neighbours, the firſt and ſtrongeſt Advances may be made, towards the rendering them honeſt, virtuous, and ſocial Creatures. We are the more inexcuſable, becauſe, in this Infancy of our Province, we are not condemned to grope our Way in the Dark, as thoſe Heathens were, but have the Experience of all Mankind for our Guide, and the Advantage of ſeeing by what Steps others have toil'd, ſlowly to the Summit of GLORY and EMPIRE; and therefore cannot be ignorant, that Foundations of this Kind are of the laſt Conſequence, to the Being and Well being of SOCIETY.</p>
            <p>Surely we are not inferior to our Neighbours in good Senſe, and the Refinements of civil Life, and ſuperior to many of them in Situation, Trade and Riches; yet
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:006935_0011_102A9B8FCF14F640"/>
ſo it is, that they have long got the Start of us in ſeveral laudable and public ſpirited Undertakings, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, in this the moſt intereſting of all.</p>
            <p>What muſt an unconcern'd Spectator think; (I ſpeak it with Deference, and Nothing but a ſincere Zeal for our Honor, cou'd induce me to make the Reflection) I ſay, what muſt the impartial World think, to ſee one City among us arriv'd to ſuch a Pitch of Luxury and Riches, as often to have entertain'd a Set of dull, ſorry, ſtrolling COMEDIANS, at the Expence of near a Thouſand Pounds yearly, and yet the whole Province have never thought themſelves in a Capacity to ſet apart One-half of that yearly Sum, for the Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of three or four Men of Learning and Virtue, to initiate our Youth in the Sciences; and, as <hi>Horace</hi> happily expreſſes it, to teach them ſuch Things as come home to Life, and which it is culpable and ſhameful not to know; namely, what renders them fitteſt for the Purpoſes of Society; what is the great End of their Being; wherein conſiſts their chief Good and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and what Actions are moſt worthy of human Nature:

As ſuch Thoughts as theſe have often occurr'd to me, it gives me Pleaſure to underſtand that the Founding a College in this Province, begins now to be ſeriouſly conſider'd; and as this great Work ſeems chiefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded, by the Difficulty of agreeing on a proper Place for fixing it, I beg leave to ſubmit my impartial Thoughts on this Head, to the Conſideration of the Public.—</p>
            <p>As to the Situation then, I can't help being ſurpris'd to hear it diſputed; ſome retir'd Corner, either within, or cloſe by the City of <hi>New-York,</hi> being certainly the only proper Place in this Province for erecting a College.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:006935_0012_102A9B9238983090"/>
There is (and I think can be) but the following Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt this Situation, <hi>viz.</hi> That here the <hi>Morals</hi> of the Scholars, will not be ſo ſafe as in the Country; and that there will be too many Amuſements to divert them from their Studies.</p>
            <p>Now near One-half of the Scholars, which, at firſt, will be young Gentlemen of the City of <hi>New York</hi> itſelf, are no Way affected by this Objection; ſince, if there is any Force in it, it wou'd be equally an Argument againſt their learning Grammar, or ſpending any Part of their Youth in their native City. I ſhall then turn my Thoughts wholly to the other Half, which will be young Gentlemen from the Country; and if I can ſhew their Parents, that <hi>New-York</hi> is no more affected by this Objection than any other Place they can fix on, I can eaſily ſuperadd ſuch Arguments as will induce them to prefer this Situation to all others.</p>
            <p>They admit, that the Converſation of poliſh'd Citizens, would be of great Advantage to their Sons; but, ſay they, in ſuch a large Place, there never fails to be worthleſs rakiſh Perſons, to debauch unwary Youth, and lead them into what (to oblige delicate Ears) is call'd the polite Vices: And therefore,
<q>
                  <hi>If Knowledge of the World muſt taint Men's Morals,</hi>
—<hi>may our Sons ever live in Ignorance!</hi>—</q>
            </p>
            <p>Before I proceed to anſwer this Objection, I might obſerve that it is wholly grounded on falſe Suppoſitions: For it is not true, that Youth wou'd never learn Vice without ſeeing it, eſpecially the Vices here meant, which ariſe from the irregular Exerciſe of our beſt and ſtrongeſt natural Paſſions, I mean the Social: No more is it true that they will always learn Vice by ſeeing it; on the Contrary, as <hi>Plato</hi> imagined the Viſion of Virtue (if pure Virtue could be ſeen) would render all Men virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; ſo, perhaps the Viſion of Vice, in all its odious Colors, is the ſtrongeſt Preſervative againſt Vice. However, I don't ſay, with ſome, that it would be
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:006935_0013_102A9B95AB0F02A0"/>
prudent to lead Youth into unneceſſary Temptation, and ſhew them Evil in order to make them Good; nor do I deny, that to preſerve the Morals found, ought to be the chief Aim of Education; but
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>As Heaven's high Will has fixt us in a State</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>That muſt not yet to pure</hi> PERFECTION <hi>riſe;</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
And in a State where Evil, being permitted, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly blended with Good, we cannot ſhew them the One without the Other, if we would ever have them behold an original Character, or aught that is real in Life; ſo that were the Force of this Objection once admitted, it will conclude equally againſt collegiate Education at <hi>New-York</hi> and all Places; and Nothing will be left for thoſe who adhere to it, but to ſhut their Sons up in Cloiſters to be entertain'd apart from So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, with the Dreams of Viſionaries, and the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Virtues of Utopian Characters: There they muſt ſleep away their whole Lives, without daring to act, leſt they act, wrong, or look into the World, leſt they ſee Evil, which is the ſame as if one ſhould die of the Fear of Death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—Nay, by this Rule, they muſt never know themſelves, or look into their own Hearts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there they would ſee a Medley of Good and Evil, or the WORLD in Miniature; and I believe no one would give the Name of Virtue to the mechanical, or rather negative Goodneſs of ſuch paſſive Creatures, as may well be ſaid never to have exiſted or awak'd into Life, ſince they deny themſelves all Opportunity of Choice, or of exerting the Freedom of their Nature, which is their Dignity, and the nobleſt Gift of GOD; and refuſe to act in Society, becauſe <hi>Plato'</hi>s Republic and <hi>More'</hi>s Utopia have no real Exiſtence.</p>
            <p>But as I know the Gentlemen, who make this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, intend their Sons for Society; and only make it from a very laudable Concern for their Morals; I ſhall not puſh its Conſequences farther, but return to the main Point, and endeavour to convince them that
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006935_0014_102A9B9822DFE6F8"/>
               <hi>New-York</hi> is, perhaps, the ſafeſt Place in this Reſpect.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, Nothing is eaſier than to prevent the Scholars from aſſociating with any idle Perſons, that do not belong to their College, by proper Regulations, and laying the Plan of it, ſo as they may all lodge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in its Walls: It is ſeldom they ſhew any Inclination to this; and every One knows that, in the largeſt Cities, the Danger complain'd of never ariſes from this, but from Clubs or Aſſociations among the Scholars them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which are always more extravagant in a pitiful Village, than in a large and well governed City.</p>
            <p>As upon the Truth of this ſeeming Parodox, depends the whole Diſpute; I beg Leave to appeal to incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable Facts and Experience, which is the beſt Way of clearing up a Truth of this Nature.</p>
            <p>I aſk any One that knows <hi>England,</hi> whether the Scholars are not far more extravagant and debauched at the Academies in the ſmall Towns there, than at the public Univerſities of <hi>Oxford</hi> or <hi>Cambridge?</hi>—And, indeed the Reaſon is obvious: Nature is the ſame, in the ſame Perſons, every where;—at <hi>Oxford, &amp;c.</hi> the Scholars are under the Eye of the public Magiſtrate, and a great many Gentlemen whoſe Characters they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere; ſo that if they are not leſs vicious, they are at leaſt more prudent in managing all their Intrigues, ſo as to give no public Offence, and in keeping within the Bounds of Decorum and good Manners in all their Clubs and Frolics: But, at the Village-Academies, the Scholars, with equal Propenſities to Vice, are not under equal Reſtraints; they only ſee a few illiterate Artificers, whom they ſoon learn to look upon as taſteleſs unpoliſh'd Clowns, and whoſe Cenſure they wholly diſregard: And thus being uncontrol'd, either by Shame or the Authority of the civil Power, they ſometimes run into the wildeſt Riots, in the Face of Day, and in Defiance of the whole Village, of which they are ſo far Maſters that none dare reſiſt, or prefer
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006935_0015_102A9B99C556C2A0"/>
a Complaint againſt them. Add to this, that, in ſuch ſorry Places, they contract a Deſire for mean Company, and a Taſte for low Vices, which eaſily diſtinguiſhes them from People of a genteel Education, all their Lives.</p>
            <p>To ſay the Temptations are fewer in a Village than in a City, however ſpacious, is ſaying no more to the Purpoſe, than that a Man (if the Compariſon may be allow'd) ſhould rather quench his Thirſt in a Brook than a River, when there is more than enough in either; for wherever there are Purchaſers, there will be found Venders or Diſpoſers.—</p>
            <p>To ſay that in the diſtant Village, there will be no Fellow-Rakes to lead them into Vice, is alſo ſaying Nothing: For if we could ſuppoſe the Country Youth, when firſt admitted to the College, ſo entirely unpol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted, and of a Make ſo frigid and paſſionleſs, as never to think of Vice without being driven into it; (which, as I obſerv'd above, is a very groundleſs Suppoſition;) yet there will be the other Half of the Scholars from <hi>New-York,</hi> to be their Maſters in this, whom the Country Gentlemen cannot ſuppoſe ſo untainted as their own Sons, without deſtroying the Force of their own Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; and whom ſurely they would not exclude from the public Benefit.</p>
            <p>But above all, if we ſhould allow that a Village is the beſt Situation of a College, (which few will allow) yet I deny that any Place, where a College is fixt, can continue long in the Nature of a Village, but muſt ſoon grow into a conſiderable Town; and thus with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any of the Advantages of <hi>New-York,</hi> the fixing our College elſewhere, would, in a few Years, be attended with all the Inconveniences we meant to ſhun; beſides ſtruggling with innumerable Difficulties at firſt, and riſquing the Succeſs of the whole Scheme.</p>
            <p>There is ſtill leſs Force in the other Part of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, that the Scholars will not apply ſo cloſely to
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006935_0016_102A9B9B89D4F7C0"/>
their Studies at <hi>New-York,</hi> as in a more retir'd Place. Is it not Emulation, or a Senſe of Shame and Honor, that can alone render Youth induſtrious, eſpecially ſuch as are become capable of Reflection? And will not this Emulation always exert itſelf in Proportion to the Notions they entertain of thoſe in whoſe Sight they act? Will it not be ſtronger in the City of <hi>New-York,</hi> where the poliſhed and learned Part of the Province are their Judges, and frequently viſit them, than in any other Place, where the People know nothing of the Matter? For this Reaſon it was, that ſome Nations not only fixed their Colleges or public Schools in their chief Cities, but even made choice of Porticos or open Halls for this Purpoſe, in the moſt frequented Places of thoſe Cities; that thus, in an Affair of ſuch general Concern, every Perſon might be an Eye-Witneſs, both of the Fidelity of the Maſter and Induſtry of the Scholar: And that this Method begot the moſt ardent Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, Reaſon as well as Experience may inform us. However, it is not abſolutely neceſſary, that we ſhould imitate them too cloſely in this: Perhaps, for ſeveral obvious Reaſons, ſome well air'd Place quite without the City, might be our moſt prudent Choice;—but if there was no other Reaſon, I ſhould think this one ſtrong enough, for fixing the College at leaſt contiguous to <hi>New-York:</hi> For, if ever we expect to ſee it flouriſhing, there muſt be a few Gentlemen of the beſt Character, both for Learning and Probity, choſen as Viſitors and even Directors at firſt, Now, tho' there may be Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen very well qualified for this in the Country, yet there would be no Poſſibility of finding a Quorum of them near one another; and if they were choſen from different Counties, they could never meet ſo often, or ſo conveniently, as to anſwer the Deſign: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Majority at leaſt of theſe Viſitors, muſt be choſen from <hi>New-York,</hi> who likewiſe can be of little Service unleſs the College is near them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:006935_0017_102A9B9F682BD040"/>
In ſhort, in whatever Light I conſider this Matter, I am ſtill the more of Opinion, that unleſs we chuſe this Situation, the Scheme will never ſucceed.—Where can we find ſufficient Accommodations for Diet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in <hi>New-York?</hi> Are there not many Gentlemen who would ſend their Sons to a College in <hi>New-York,</hi> who wou'd not ſend them to a Village, where they muſt be provided with Diet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> perhaps, in the Houſe of ſome poor Artificer? And are not ſuch Circumſtances likely to ruin the Undertaking, ſince the Succeſs of all Schemes depends much on the Notions firſt entertain'd of them.</p>
            <p>But further, the Knowledge of <hi>Languages, Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi> and <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> is but a ſmall Part of the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ſuch as are deſign'd to be uſeful in Society: Thoſe ought to know Men and the World. For this Reaſon, our European Countrymen, tho' educated in the moſt refin'd Cities, travel into foreign Countries; but as our Youth can have no Opportunity of travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, we ſhould make up that Loſs to them as well as we can, by ſending them a few Years to the politeſt Part of our Province. Now ſuch is the State of our Affairs, that the Generality of them muſt be Farmers of their own Eſtates, and therefore, can allot but a ſmall Part of their Time to the Purpoſes of Education, which ought to be well huſbanded, by fixing the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege in a Place where, at one and the ſame Time, they can learn the <hi>Belles Lettres,</hi> Breeding, and ſome Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Men and Things: And thus, that Frugality and Induſtry, ſo neceſſary in the Infancy of States, pleads ſtrongly for fixing the College at <hi>New-York,</hi> ſince the Circumſtances of our Country Youth, will not admit of their ſpending any Part of their Time (after their Collegiate Education is finiſh'd) in viſiting polite Cities, in order to ſhake off that aukward Bluntneſs, which they muſt contract, if immur'd at Schools and Colleges apart from the Sight of Men, for the firſt Twenty Years of their Life: And if they could afford the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:006935_0018_102A9BA1D2058298"/>
and Time neceſſary to this, then indeed would they run a hundred Times more Danger of Corruption, when living at large, as their own Maſters, than when under the Tuition of others:—Beſides, ſuch as have not acquir'd the Air of the Gentleman when young, find it too late when grown up.</p>
            <p>I know there are ſome who talk very lightly of this, and think it no neceſſary Part of Education:—But of a very different Opinion was the noble Author of the Characteriſticks; than whom, none ever ſcan'd human Nature with a more piercing or more candid Eye. In his Advice to an Author he ſpeaks thus; <q>It ſeems improbable, that according to modern Erudition, and as Science is now diſtributed, our ingenious Youths ſhould obtain the full Advantage of a juſt and liberal Education, by uniting the Scholar Part, with that of the real Gentleman and a Man of Breeding:—Letters are baniſh'd, I know not where, into diſtant Cloiſters and unpractis'd Cells, confin'd to the mean Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of bearded Boys.—The ſprightly Arts and Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are ſever'd from Philoſophy, which conſequently muſt grow droniſh, inſipid, pedantic, uſeleſs, and directly oppoſite to the real Knowledge and Practice of the World and Mankind. Our Youth accordingly ſeem to have their Chance between two widely different Roads; either that of Pedantry and School-Learning, which lies amidſt the Dregs of ancient Literature; or that of the faſhionable illiterate World, which aims merely at the Character of the fine Gentleman:</q> But why not find the middle Road, and unite the Scholar with the Gentleman? <q>Why might not a <hi>Homer,</hi> a <hi>Xenophon,</hi> a <hi>Tully, &amp;c.</hi> be ſtudy'd as well in a CA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PITAL City and amid the World, as in a Country Town?</q>—Thus far this great Writer: And if he thought it a Defect in our famous <hi>Engliſh</hi> Univerſities, that there were no Schools in them for the polite and manly Exerciſes, as in ancient <hi>Greece;</hi>—if he thought
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006935_0019_102A9BA35D5287E0"/>
the Fellowſhip of bearded Boys, as he calls them, even in the poliſh'd Cities of <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge,</hi> unlikely to form a Man for Society, without a farther Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the World: What would he have thought had one told him; that in half a Century after his Death, a Society of his Countrymen, in a remote Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of the World, would be ſo little concerned to give their Youth the few Advantages of this Kind, which are in their Power (by fixing their firſt Seminary in their moſt poliſh'd City) as to propoſe baniſhing them and Learning together, into, I know not what, lonely Corner of a half ſettled Country?—Who that knows the Method of Education practis'd among the <hi>Romans,</hi> and how careful they were to accuſtom their Youth betimes to ſtand the Sight of Men, unabaſh'd, by making them as early as the Age of Sixteen, (often ſooner) declaim publicly; "not on fanciful Theſes, but Caſes that might really be brought into their Courts of Judicature;" I ſay, who that knows this, could help being ſurpris'd it ſhould ever enter into our Thoughts, to ſend our Youth into the Depths of Woods, to perform their Collegiate Exerciſes, in the unambitious Preſence of inanimate Trees?—What a ſorry Figure is a young Man like to make thus educated, in a four Retreat from the World, when he obtains the Honor of a Seat in our Aſſembly, or is nominated a Judge in any of our Counties? How thoroughly ignorant muſt he be of the Heart of Man, and how incapable to trace Villainy thro' its various Mazes, in order to reach Truth? Of what avail will his Learning be, but to render him ſo much the more a narrow-ſoul'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited Pedant? And what his boaſted Innocence, but to make him ſo much the more an ignorant Dupe.—</p>
            <p>I am far from thinking it neceſſary, that our Youth ſhould be Maſters of all the inſipid Punctilios of <hi>French Politeſſe,</hi> nor is there any Danger of this in our Country; but there is an artificial Manner of ſoftning our natural
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:006935_0020_102A9BA601DBFB90"/>
Roughneſs, which diſtinguiſhes the Man from the Savage; and a certain Eaſineſs of Behaviour, which is the Characteriſtic of the Gentleman;—this I could wiſh to ſee every one Maſter of, who acts in any higher Sphere, it being the peculiar Ornament of a public Station. Now I hope no one will think it any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection to ſay, this ſo neceſſary Air of the Gentleman, is not to be acquir'd in any Part of this Country but our capital City. Whoever knows the general Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Squire, that has been buried all his Days in the Country without the Benefit of a public Education, will own the Truth of this. It is well indeed, if we have one City that is arrived at this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Pitch of Politeneſs; and, if She is, I hope never to ſee her go farther.—</p>
            <p>It may be objected by ſome, that Education will be more expenſive at <hi>New-York,</hi> than in the Country: But this Objection, like all the Others, ariſe wholly from our not conſidering how Things muſt be ſome Years hence.—Even at preſent, I don't ſee that Proviſions are much cheaper in the Country than in <hi>New-York;</hi> and I'm ſure, were there a College fix'd at any of our Villages, where there is no regular Market, there would be ſuch a Difficulty of Ending Proviſions at firſt, and the Country People would know ſo well how to take the Advantage of this, that every Thing would for ſome Time be dearer than at <hi>New-York;</hi> and it is ſeldom that the Prices of Things, when once raiſed in a Place, are ſuffered to fall again, eſpecially where the Number of People would probably be increas'd yearly.</p>
            <p>But the main Expence is apprehended from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Fuel for Fire: To this I anſwer, that Firewood in a few Years, muſt be cheaper at <hi>New-York</hi> than in any Inland Place; for, fix our College where we will, the Woods near it muſt ſoon fail, and then, it muſt be much more expenſive to be ſupplied by Land than Water Carriages. Beſides, 'tis the Opinion of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006935_0021_102A9BA9DB89A308"/>
many, that in leſs perhaps than a half a Century, Coal will be the cheapeſt Fuel that can be uſed in moſt Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this Province; and in that Caſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I need not add that a College at <hi>New-York,</hi> can more eaſily be ſupplied with that Commodity, than in any other Place of this Country.</p>
            <p>As to incident Expences, it ought to be reckon'd a happy Circumſtance, when a young Man has the Taſte and Spirit to be ambitious of ſpending what Pocket-Money is allow'd him, in the beſt Company he can find; and it entirely depends on the Parents themſelves how great this Expence ſhall be: For Youth, at Colleges any where, always find the Way to the Bottom of their Purſes, and they can go no farther at <hi>New-York:</hi>—Beſides, I hope I have ſaid enough above, to convince any impartial Parent, that it is abſolutely neceſſary, their Sons ſhould paſs ſome Part of their younger Years at <hi>New-York;</hi> and therefore, that the fixing our College there, will be ſo far from being more expenſive, that ſome Years of Time and a very conſiderable Sum of Money muſt thereby be ſaved to Them.</p>
            <p>Upon the Whole then, I flatter myſelf, the impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Part of the Country Gentlemen, are fully perſuaded, by this Time, that to place the College at <hi>New-York,</hi> muſt be much to their Advantage, tho' it be pretty indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent to the People of that City.—I have made it as probable as the NATURE of the Thing will admit, that the Morals of their Sons will, at leaſt, be as ſafe there, as at a public College any where elſe:—That they will be far more alert, induſtrious and emulous of Improvement:—That in any other Situation, the Meaneſs of Company, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt make them contract a Lowneſs of Taſte; and inſtead of this noble Emulation, beget a lifeleſs Stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and Languor, which muſt hurt the Character of our College at firſt, and, probably, ſoon prove its Ruin:—That as there is as yet but one Place in this Province, where the Breeding of the Gentleman can
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006935_0022_102A9BAB6B98C058"/>
be acquir'd, and our Youth can ſpare no Part of their Time for this Purpoſe but when at College; we ought, for the Sake of ſaving Time and Money, to fix our College in this ONE Place, otherwiſe we deny them all Chance of uniting the Gentleman with the Scholar, or ever arriving at that Politeneſs which is the Bond of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ocial Life,—the Ornament of human Nature.</p>
            <p>I can ſee no Way of eluding the Force of theſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but by ſaying, that the Politeneſs, which I have all along been contending for, is to be acquir'd by converſing with inanimate Nature, or is altogether unneceſſary; and this would diſcover ſuch a Barbarity of Taſte and Sentiment, that I am far from expecting to hear that any One, who aſſumes the Name of a Gentleman, will henceforth ſhew himſelf a Stickler for the rural Situation; and I am bound in Charity to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, thoſe who formerly have been ſuch, have ſuffered themſelves to be hurried away by the popular Objection concerning the Corruption of Morals, without examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Diſpute in all its Conſequences.</p>
            <p>Indeed, were the Objection admitted in its full Force, the Evil would be overbalanc'd by numberleſs Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages. At <hi>New-York,</hi> our Youth will, at leaſt, obtain as much Knowledge of the World, as will, in ordinary Occurrences, enable them to underſtand their own and Country's Intereſt, without any Danger of being miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or duped by deſigning Men: And if they ſhould run into ſome more of the Extravagancies of Youth here than elſewhere, (which I flatly deny,) yet wou'd it have no bad Effect upon them, when they return to the Scenes of ſtill Life, and a laborious Induſtry in the Country:—

All I ſhall add, is to beg my Countrymen, to conſider well the Whole of what I here ſubmit to them, before
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006935_0023_102A9BAE90391768"/>
they pronounce upon any Part of it. I have no Aim, but to ſee my Country poliſh'd, floriſhing and happy, which depends not a little upon this very Matter in Queſtion. It is very poſſible I may be wrong in ſome of my Opinions; but, if I did not firmly believe them right, I ſhould not have dared to publiſh them in an Affair of ſo general Importance: And therefore, where I am wrong, I hope to be forgiven with the ſame Candor, with which unaſk'd, I have endeavour'd to ſet this Matter in its true Light.—</p>
            <p>The Queſtion is indeed quite new to me, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, has made me handle it in a different Manner from what otherwiſe I ſhould have done.—It is true, it has been diſputed, whether mere Boys ſhould learn Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar at private Schools, or public Ones in large Cities: <hi>Quintilian,</hi> the beſt of Judges, prefers a public School from the very firſt; ſo doth a fine Writer in the <hi>Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator,</hi> (N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 313, 337. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)—The great Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> is indeed of the other Opinion, but then he ſpeaks warmly of the Advantages of public Education, and tells us the Method he propoſes, is only calculated for GENTLEMEN's Sons of large Fortunes, when they are very young, and may be conſidered as white Paper, beſides he makes Travelling an expreſs Condition:—I ſay this has been diſputed; but whether a College for finiſhing the Education of ſuch as are grown up to be Men, ſhould be in a poliſh'd City, was never perhaps diſputed before; eſpecially when deſign'd, for ſuch as can have no other Opportunity to know any Thing of polite Life. I am ſure, we have no Inſtance of any <hi>European</hi> Nations, that did not plant their firſt Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries in their beſt Cities; and if any of them had been ſo romantic, as to chuſe a deſert Corner for this Purpoſe, it wou'd ſoon, as I ſaid before, have fall'n into all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences of a populous Place, tho' perhaps in many Centuries it would not have had the Advantages of a polite ONE.—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:006935_0024_102A9BB15CA7E830"/>
After all, if I might preſume to adviſe, I can't help ſaying we begin at the wrong End, if we apply the Money already rais'd, to the immediate Rearing of a Building. I ſubmit it to the better Judgment of thoſe concerned, whether it were not the better Method, to apply the Intereſt of the £ 3443: 18 s. forthwith, as Salaries for two ſufficient Men, each to teach two Claſſes at firſt; <hi>viz.</hi> the One GREEK and LATIN, with the moſt uſeful Branches of the MATHEMATICS; and the Other moral PHILOSOPHY, and what is comprehended under the general Name of PHYSICS. Two ſuch Men, no Doubt, may be found in this or ſome of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Provinces; and the Intereſt of ſaid Principal, together with what may be paid by the Scholars, will make tolerable Encouragment for them, even after deducting as much as Rent Apartments to teach in, if the Town cannot furniſh them gratis.—Thus wou'd our Youth immediately have moſt of the Advantages of Collegiate Education, till the Wiſdom of the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlature, ſhall find Ways and Means of raiſing a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Sum, for erecting and endowing a College, providing for a greater Number of Teachers, and 'till ſome future Circumſtances, ſhall fix their Choice of a fit Situation, if theſe Arguments ſhall not have that Effect. And would not this be better, to ſee our Youth in the mean Time reaping the Benefit, while our Edifice riſes by Degrees, and with the Conveniency of the Country, than to expend the Money already rais'd in rearing a Building, which, when finiſh'd, muſt ſtand ſeveral Years perhaps, as a Monument of our Poverty, or ſomething worſe, before we are able to raiſe a Fund for endowing it and providing for Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, which is the main Point:—In this Caſe it would at leaſt be a dozen Years e're our Youth can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantag'd by it, tho' the Country were much more in the Humor of contributing to this laudable Work than they ſeem to be;—and therefore</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:006935_0025_102A9BB346987618"/>
I ſubmit it to the Wiſdom of the ASSEMBLY, whether they ought not immediately to order a Bill to be brought in, for applying the Intereſt of the £. 3443. 18ſ. as above propos'd:—And moreover, in order to do the Whole at once, whether it where not abſolutely neceſſary, if poſſible, to agree at the ſame Time, upon the Site and Plan of the Building, that ſo by a Clauſe in the ſame Bill, the Gentlemen already empower'd to put out the preſent Principal at Intereſt, and receive private Donations, (with any others that ſhall be judg'd proper) may be farther empower'd, and by an annual Lottery, not exceeding a certain moderate Sum, to carry on a Building 'till it is finiſh'd, according to ſaid PLAN; and to receive, and let out at Intereſt, all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Donations, which ought to be kept untouch'd, for endowing the College when the Work is compleated: Thus, as I obſerv'd above, we ſhould ſee our Youth, in the Interim, improving in polite Literature: our Edifice riſing gradually by an eaſy Lottery: and by the Time it can be finiſhed, the Generoſity of many pious Donors, will, no Doubt, ſupply us with a very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Sum for Endowment.—If this Method is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd, I dare aſſert, we ſhall in a few Years ſee a Work accompliſhed, which will be a laſting Honor to our Memory, and Benefit to our Country; and that too with much greater Eaſe, than by any Method our Neighbours have hit upon, or perhaps we ourſelves would otherwiſe ever think of.—</p>
            <p>Having, in the firſt Part, been too prolix, I could only hint at theſe Things; but a Hint can be eaſily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd by the Judgment of thoſe to whom I chiefly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs. I muſt alſo ſuperſede what I intended to ſay of the OEconomy and Regulations that might be obſerved: I ſhall only add that <hi>Oxford, Leyden, &amp;c.</hi> are too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex and large to be any Model for us; the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Colleges of <hi>New-England, Pennſylvania, &amp;c.</hi> may be kept chiefly in our Eye; but tho' the People of theſe
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006935_0026_102A9BB7B633FA00"/>
Provinces have the Honor to ſet us an Example in this truly noble WORK, we have the Advantage of ſeeing where they have been deficient, and of being ſenſible that Something might be contriv'd more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious than any of their Schemes: But it will be ſoon enough to ſpeak of this, if the Aſſembly ſhall think the Propoſals here laid down worthy their Attention; and then, tho' I'm far from pretending to direct, I ſhall always be ready to offer any further Hint that occurs to me, as every honeſt Man ought frankly to do on ſuch an Occaſion.—</p>
            <p>Mean Time, permit me, with a ſincere and well-meant Zeal, to intreat my Countrymen, particularly thoſe at the Helm of Affairs, to think ſeriouſly of the vaſt Importance of the great Undertaking, and to proceed, without loſing one Moment more, to bring it, ſome-how, to a ſpeedy Iſſue.—Let us think how much the ſo doing is incumbent on us, and how much it will redound to our GLORY:—Let the diſtant Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect diſtend every Heart with Patriot-Views, and fire every Boſom with active Zeal, 'till no Contention re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, but who ſhall bear the firſt and greateſt Part in ſuch a glorious WORK!—Happy he! whoſe Pen can be any Way inſtrumental in raiſing ſuch a noble Spirit among us!—Thoſe who have the ſame Idea of its Conſequences, with me, will never ceaſe to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute their Mite for this good Purpoſe, however fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs their Labours may be: And thoſe who reflect on the ſurpriſing Turns and Inſtability of human Affairs, cannot but ardently wiſh to ſee an early Foundation laid for propagating among us a Spirit of INDUSTRY, LIBERTY, LEARNING and TRUTH; with a thoro' Contempt of Sloth, Slavery, Ignorance and religious IMPOSTURE; ſince 'tis this, next to the auſpicious Protection of HEAVEN, and our Mother Country; which can alone make our Government live out its full Period of political Life.—And as we can never be
