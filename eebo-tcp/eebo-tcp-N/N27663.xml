            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>THE miracles wrought by Jeſus Chriſt, when he entered on his public min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry, commanded general attention among the Jews, and engaged them to inquire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his perſon, and the deſign of his coming into the world. Nicodemus, a Phariſee, and a man of high rank in Iſrael, came to Jeſus, by night, to learn from his mouth the nature of his doctrine and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The addreſs of this Jewiſh ruler was
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:036872_0005_100B26DC84EB8198"/>in terms of high reſpect—<hi>Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God; for no man can do theſe miracles that thou doeſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept God be with him.</hi> The Saviour <hi>anſwered and ſaid unto him, Verily, verily, I ſay unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the kingdom of God.</hi> He who is <hi>the faithful and true Witneſs,</hi> repeats the word <hi>verily,</hi> to give greater weight, and to excite higher attention, to the truth he utters. Let our ears and our hearts be open, to learn the nature and neceſſity of the change of which he diſcourſeth in the paſſage before us.</p>
               <p>IT is evident that ſome change is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by being <hi>born again;</hi> and that this, in whatever it conſiſts, is abſolutely neceſſary for the entrance of any individual of the human race into <hi>the kingdom of God.</hi> In the text, <hi>man</hi> is uſed indefinitely; it is as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to the Jew as to the Gentile, and to perſons of one nation, age, or rank, as another.</p>
               <p>To be born again, muſt mean ſomething beyond mere external reformation; for if it did not, Nicodemus would not have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his ſurpriſe, as we find he did, at what Chriſt taught. Not only the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, but even Pagans, urged the neceſſity of breaking off from vice, and becoming pure in outward behavior, to ſecure the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:036872_0006_100B26DECFE50BC8"/>friendſhip and bleſſing of the Deity. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever diſagreed mankind have been concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nature of virtue, and whatever vices they have patronized by their doctrines, or recommended by their examples, they have always in their creeds <hi>profeſſed</hi> to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend purity of morals.</p>
               <p>THERE is nothing in the text, taken in its connexion, to countenance the opinion of ſome ancient and modern Chriſtian wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that the ordinance of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is the principal thing intended by being born again. A view of the context will refute this opinion, as well as that of thoſe who extend the new birth to nothing beyond common morality. <hi>Nicodemus ſaith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter the ſecond time into his mother's womb, and be born? Jeſus anſwered, Verily, verily, I ſay unto thee, except a man be born of water, and of the ſpirit, he cannot enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. That which is born of the fleſh is fleſh; and that which is born of the ſpirit is ſpirit. Marvel not that I ſaid unto thee, Ye muſt be born again. The wind bloweth where it liſteth, and thou heareſt the ſound thereof, but canſt not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth; ſo is every one that is born of the ſpirit. Nicodemus anſwered and ſaid unto him, How can theſe things be?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:036872_0007_100B26E091415008"/>
THE rite of Chriſtian baptiſm, in which the adult, or the infant, is waſhed with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, teaches by an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to our ſenſes, the abſolute need of an internal change, or of being regenerated, to qualify for the enjoyment of God: But the adminiſtration of this ordinance doth not purify the heart, nor can we certainly determine that the perſon baptized, is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of that holineſs without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord. Baptiſm is of high im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and no one can <hi>deſpiſe</hi> it without bringing great guilt upon himſelf; but we have no authority to affirm that every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized perſon will be eternally loſt. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt had riſen from the dead, he ſaid unto his apoſtles, in Mark xvi. 15, 16— <hi>Go ye into all the world, and preach the goſpel to every creature, he that believeth and is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, ſhall be ſaved; but he that believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> From theſe words we can determine that every one who ſpends his whole life in unbelief will be damned; but not that every unbaptized perſon will be doomed to everlaſting miſery. We cannot be juſtified in excluding every unbaptized perſon from Heaven, unleſs it had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in Chriſt's declaration, or ſomewhere elſe in the ſcriptures, that "he who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not, <hi>and is not baptized,</hi> ſhall be for
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:036872_0008_100B26E24E8AF238"/>miſerable." Some may be deprived of baptiſm without any fault of theirs; and others may have ſuch conſcientious ſcruples as to prevent their receiving this ordinance, and yet may be members of Chriſt's myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical body. No unbaptized perſon can be a member of the <hi>viſible</hi> church, according to the form under which it appears in the New-Teſtament. To the baptiſmal waſhing Chriſt probably alludes when he ſpeaketh, in the context, of being <hi>born of water.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WERE nothing more meant by being born of water than the baptiſmal dedication, why ſhould Nicodemus ſay, <hi>How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter the ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ond time into his mother's womb and be born?</hi> If water baptiſm be the new birth taught in the text, how could Nicodemus have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſo ignorant and perplexed, after Chriſt had explained its nature? The ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe of this Jewiſh ruler remained through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conference, and he exclaimed <hi>How can theſe things be!</hi> He well knew that, from the days of Abraham, none had been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the viſible church without ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to circumciſion: And if he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that Chriſt only meant to change the ſeal of the covenant, or to put baptiſm in the place of circumciſion, what could there
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:036872_0009_100B26E479A95270"/>have been in this ſo myſterious to his mind? Beſides, as is generally allowed, baptiſm had long before the coming of Chriſt, been adminiſtered to Gentile proſelytes, on their admiſſion into the Jewiſh church. His knowledge of this fact would have render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed baptiſm yet more familiar. We do not find in all the New-Teſtament that the uſe of this ordinance excited wonder; as it muſt have done if it had been a practice wholly without a precedent among the Jews. The prieſts and the levites whom the Jews ſent to John, to enquire who he was, aſked him, <hi>Why baptizeſt thou then, if thou be not that Chriſt, nor Elias, neither that prophet!</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">John i. 25.</note> It is plain that they did not inquire concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baptiſm as a rite, but why <hi>he</hi> baptized. It ſeems that they expected the Meſſiah would baptize when he ſhould appear.</p>
               <p>IF baptiſm be ſuppoſed to be the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation taught in the text, we ſhall find ourſelves involved in inſuperable difficulties, in reconciling it with the other words which paſſed between Chriſt and Nicodemus. In addition to what has been ſaid, it may be obſerved, that the new birth which our Lord inculcates, is attributed to the Holy Ghoſt as its author: <hi>Except a man be born of the ſpirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="unknown:036872_0010_100B26E79C63E9F0"/>To be <hi>born of the ſpirit,</hi> is the ſame thing with the renovation of the heart by the ſpirit of God. This change is the effect of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine operation on the heart. The neceſſity of it is derived from man's moral pollution—<hi>That which is born of the fleſh is fleſh.</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is introduced into the heart of apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate man, only by the ſpirit of God—<hi>That which is born of the ſpirit is ſpirit.</hi> In the manner of the ſpirit's operation on the heart there is ſomething which we cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend; which operation Chriſt compareth to the blowing of the wind. But what is there either in the adminiſtration of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of baptiſm, or in the practice of common morality, that is myſterious?</p>
               <p>THE new birth inculcated in the text, conſiſteth in the turning of the heart from ſin to holineſs. It is in conſequence of this change that any one of the human race be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh a child of God by faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>BY the phraſe, <hi>the kingdom of God,</hi> in the paſſage before us, cannot be primarily meant the viſible church, nor the New-Teſtament diſpenſation; becauſe many have been in the kingdom of God in theſe ſenſes, who were his enemies, and remained ſo through life. The kingdom of God is here to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as including the ſtate of grace into
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:036872_0011_100B26EAF7C2B050"/>which the regenerate are brought, in the preſent world, and the ſtate of glory pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them in the world to come. In this ſenſe the phraſe is often uſed in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Luke vi. 20. <hi>And he lifted up his eyes on his diſciples, and ſaid, bleſſed are ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.</hi> Rom. xiv. 17. <hi>For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteouſneſs, and peace, and joy in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt.</hi> 1 Cor. xv. 50. <hi>Fleſh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.</hi> None can <hi>ſee</hi> the kingdom of God, or enjoy its bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, except thoſe who are born again.</p>
               <p>THE words of Chriſt in the text, lead us to conſider the nature and neceſſity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation.</p>
               <p>ACCORDING to the method propoſed I ſhall begin with inquiring into the nature of regeneration. I ſhall,</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. INTRODUCE ſeveral paſſages from the ſcriptures, as a guide in the intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubject before us. Deut. xxx. 6. <hi>And the Lord thy God will circumciſe thine heart, and the heart of thy ſeed, to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy ſoul, that thou mayeſt live.</hi> Pſalm li. 10. <hi>Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right ſpirit within me.</hi> Jerem. xxiv. 7. <hi>And I will give them an heart to know me,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:036872_0012_100B26ED32175188"/>that I am the Lord; and they ſhall be my people, and I will be their God: for they ſhall return unto me with their whole heart.</hi> xxxi. 33. <hi>But this ſhall be the covenant that I will make with the houſe of Iſrael; after thoſe days, ſaith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they ſhall be my people.</hi> Ezek. xxxvi. 25, 26, 27. <hi>Then will I ſprinkle clean water upon you and ye ſhall be clean: from all your filthineſs, and from all your idols, will I cleanſe you. A new heart alſo will I give you, and a new ſpirit will I put within you; and I will take away the ſtony heart out of your fleſh, and I will give you an heart of fleſh. And I will put my ſpirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes, and ye ſhall keep my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and do them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I APPEAL to every candid reader of the ſcriptures, whether it be poſſible, by any fair interpretation, to underſtand by the foregoing texts leſs than a complete change of character, or a new temper of mind. Hence appears the propriety of Chriſt's ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Nicodemus, <hi>Art thou a maſter of Iſrael, and knoweſt not theſe things?</hi> "Are you a teacher of high rank among the Jews, and are you ſo blind, as not to know that the ſcriptures, which you profeſs to be able to explain, abound with the doctrine of the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:036872_0013_100B26F2036527E8"/>new birth which I am inculcating? Why do you ſtumble at the neceſſity of this change, by a divine operation, ſince it is ſo clearly revealed in the oracles God?"</p>
               <p>I WILL now introduce a few texts from the New-Teſtament on the ſubject before us. John i. 12, 13. <hi>But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the ſons of God, even to them that believe on his name. Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</hi> 2 Cor. iv. 16. <hi>For God, who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Eph. ii. 10. <hi>For we are his workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we ſhould walk in them.</hi> iv. 24. <hi>And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteouſneſs and true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</hi> 1 John v. 18. <hi>We know that whoſoever is born of God ſinneth not: but he that is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of God keepeth himſelf, and that wicked one toucheth him not.</hi> Titus iii. 5. <hi>Not by works of righteouſneſs which we have done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us, by the waſhing of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>MAY not every one be convinced by this ſelection of a few paſſages, out of many, recorded in the Jewiſh and Chriſtian ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:036872_0014_100B26F4F3D43810"/>that an eſſential change of heart is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in regeneration? God circumciſeth the heart to love him.—He giveth the regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate a heart to know him.—He putteth his law in their inward parts, and writeth it in their heart.—He giveth them a new heart and a new ſpirit.—He putteth his ſpirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them.—He cauſeth them to walk in his ſtatutes.—They who believe on the name of Jeſus Chriſt, are born not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God.—He hath ſhined in their hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of his glory in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.—The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate are God's workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works. They put on the new man, which after God is crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in righteouſneſs and true holineſs.—They are begotten of God: And through his mercy they are ſaved by the waſhing of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>FROM the account of this change which hath been taken from the word of truth, it appears that God operateth on the heart by his ſpirit, previouſly to its holy exertions, and that all its exerciſes are the effects of this divine operation. God worketh in the ſaved both to will and to do. Hence many divines have, with propriety, made a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction between regeneration and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: meaning by the firſt, the energy of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:036872_0015_100B26F6784AEB50"/>the holy ſpirit in changing the heart; and by the laſt, the holy exerciſes of the heart which follow; ſuch as love, repentance, faith, and other graces. Certainly the tree muſt be made good, before its fruit can be good: And as the unregenerate are wholly without holineſs, it is evident that when it is found in any man, it muſt be attributed to the holy ſpirit, as its author. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion men are active, and are as free in turning to God as in any exerciſes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. The peculiar energy of the Deity which giveth birth to holineſs in creatures is as reconcileable with their freedom, as his energy which extends to the common actions of life. Man was a moral agent when he was firſt created. He was not brought into exiſtence without any charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or with a heart clear from any moral bias, like a piece of paper which has noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing written upon it. Man was not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, or clear from ſin, but he was poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively holy. Eccl. vii. 29. <hi>Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have ſought out many inventions.</hi> If the divine power which created man holy at firſt, did not impair his freedom as a moral agent, the divine power which createth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in the heart of any individual of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am's poſterity, in any period of his exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, does not impair his freedom. The
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:036872_0016_100B26F8C50483F0"/>objection brought againſt the doctrine of regeneration, on the ground of its deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man's freedom, goes to the denial of all created holineſs, and conſequently to a denial that Adam was holy in the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his exiſtence.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. REGENERATION hath its ſeat in the <hi>heart,</hi> or the temper of the mind. This has already been obſerved, but it deſerves a more particular conſideration.</p>
               <p>ALL men, whether good or bad, are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of diſtinguiſhing between holineſs and ſin, and of knowing their duty. This fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulty is called <hi>The Underſtanding.</hi> The pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure or the pain which the mind feels in a review of its actions, is ſtiled <hi>The Conſcience.</hi> This, in ſome inſtances, operates to a high degree, in the worſt of men while in the preſent life, and will be like a worm that never dies, to the impenitent in the world to come. A power of chooſing or refuſing, is alſo poſſeſſed both by the righteous and the wicked, which is called <hi>The Will.</hi> The moral exerciſes of the mind are according to a certain bias, or taſte, which is called <hi>The Heart.</hi> As this is holy or ſinful, men are holy or ſinful in their volitions. In this bias, or taſte, are included <hi>The Affections;</hi> which may be ſummed up in love and hatred.
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:036872_0017_100B26FB463176E8"/>The good man reliſhes the beauty of God's moral character, and chooſes to ſerve him. The wicked man has an oppoſite reliſh, and chooſes to diſobey him.</p>
               <p>A MINUTE delineation of the faculties and operations of the human mind, does not fall within my preſent deſign. All will admit a diſtinction between a capacity to know what is right, and a diſpoſition either to conform, or not conform to it. The ſcriptures proceed on the ground of this diſtinction, and that it is admitted by man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Under the firſt head of this general diviſion of the mind, are included the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and the conſcience; and under the laſt, the moral taſte, the will, and the affections. Theſe three laſt compoſe the <hi>heart.</hi> By keeping in view the definitions juſt given, my meaning may be gathered when either of theſe words occur in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing diſcourſes.</p>
               <p>WERE man deſtitute of a capacity of diſtinguiſhing between holineſs and ſin, and of voluntary action with reſpect to them, he could not be a ſubject of moral govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he could not be accountable to the ſupreme Judge, nor would he have any thing to hope or fear from the retributions of eternity. However man's reaſoning powers may be impaired, or whatever dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:036872_0018_100B26FDF4C2F928"/>may be thrown upon them by ſin, or however hardened conſcience may become by long reſiſting its dictates, his general capacity remains. He retains his place in the ſcale of being; and will be rewarded, or puniſhed, agreeable to the law of recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. He does not by his revolt loſe his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to God, nor to his neighbor: neither are his obligations in the leaſt diminiſhed to love the former with all his heart, and the latter as himſelf. The tranſgreſſor can do nothing which makes the ſmalleſt approach towards the annihilation of his intelligent nature; nor can he do any thing which will either overthrow, or weaken, the principles on which God governs his creatures. Sin conſiſts in a wrong diſpoſition, or temper, of mind. It involves in its nature rebellion againſt the order which God hath eſtabliſhed in the moral world, and could its wiſhes be accompliſhed, Jehovah would ceaſe to ſit on the throne of the univerſe. The unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate are not under the ſame kind of inabil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of loving and ſerving God, as a deaf man is of hearing ſounds, or as a blind man is of diſcerning colours; but their inability ariſes from a heart which is oppoſed both to the law and the goſpel. Hence we may ſee that their inability is of a criminal na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that the higher it riſes, the more deſerving they are of the divine wrath.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="unknown:036872_0019_100B27003090F008"/>
THE heart, or the temper of the mind, is changed in regeneration. There is noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this change which reſembles the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of a plant into a living thinking creature, or of the beaſts of the field into men. The deſign of it is to reſtore the holy temper which was loſt by the apoſtacy. To the regenerate is imparted a diſpoſition which harmonizes with the place which man holds in the family of the great Parent and Lord of all. The ſubjects of the new birth do not aſpire to the rank of angels, nor repine at the lower grade aſſigned them by infinite wiſdom and goodneſs. Their great or their ſmall reaſoning powers, their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the arts and ſciences, or their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with them, remain as before: their hearts only are immediately affected by regeneration.</p>
               <p>THE unregenerate are ſometimes deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in ſcripture as having the <hi>underſtanding</hi> darkened; but this ariſes from the <hi>blindneſs of their heart.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Eph. iv. 18.</note> Under the influence of a corrupt temper the beauty of holineſs is not diſcerned. The <hi>knowledge,</hi> or the <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> or the <hi>light,</hi> given in regeneration, immediately reſpects the moral ſtate of the mind. The regenerate emerge from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs into light by receiving a new heart:
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:036872_0020_100B27026402B060"/>they now become the ſubjects of divine il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination.</p>
               <p>As in the ſcriptures all the faculties of the ſoul are conſidered as receiving their moral complexion from the heart, deprav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity is ſometimes predicated of them all. For the ſame reaſon a change of heart is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as ſetting the whole ſoul right, and as extending its influence even to the body. But neither our corporeal members, nor our eſſential faculties as moral agents, are the immediate ſeat of holineſs or ſin. They are holy or ſinful according to the end to which they are devoted by the heart. When any are regenerated they <hi>glorify God in their body, and in their ſpirit.</hi> Hence babes in divine knowledge are preſerved from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive deluſions, and are trained up for the kingdom of glory; while men of the world, of ſtrong mental powers, and high attainments in ſcience, are ſeen to imbibe moſt abſurd and fatal errors.</p>
               <p>THE light imparted by the Holy Ghoſt in regeneration, does not imply the diſcovery of any truth which is not contained in the Bible; but it is deſigned to give to the heart a reliſh for the doctrines, laws, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which are contained in that holy book. If in the new birth ſome truth were commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:036872_0021_100B2703E80ED648"/>which is not to be found in the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word, we ſhould be left without any ſtanding rule for the trial of the ſpirits. The change wrought in regeneration, brings the heart into harmony with the plan of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is revealed in the ſacred volume. The book of God appears in a new light to thoſe who are born again; not becauſe any new truth is revealed, but becauſe their hearts have a new reliſh, and in conſequence of this they diſcover new beauties in the law and goſpel. Now they receive the divine word, not as the word of men, but as THE WORD OF GOD.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly. REGENERATION is an inſtantane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous change. This is an obvious concluſion from its conſiſting in a new heart, or a holy temper, in oppoſition to the old man, or to a mind at enmity with God. Among the unregenerate ſome are openly vicious, and others maintain external purity in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; ſome are ſunk in ſtupidity, and oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are filled with fearful apprehenſions of the wrath to come; but whatever variety is to be found among them, they all agree in being alienated from the life of God. There is no eſſential alteration of character in any one of the human race, except he be born again. Between ſin and holineſs there can be no medium; ſince they are directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:036872_0022_100B2707CADAFDE0"/>to each other. There is no perſon on the earth who is not either the friend, or the enemy of God. The words of Chriſt, in Matth. xii. 30, place this beyond doubt, <hi>He that is not with me is againſt me; and he that gathereth not with me ſcattereth abroad.</hi> Between the intereſts of Chriſt's kingdom and thoſe of Satan's, there is no commun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion. Every perſon in this aſſembly, or any where on the earth, is either in the road to heaven, or in the road to hell; and were he this moment to enter the world of ſpirits, he would either be received into paradiſe, or be doomed to endleſs miſery.</p>
               <p>THERE can be no point of time in which one is neither in a renewed, nor an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed ſtate; and therefore when the new heart is given, it muſt be given in an inſtant. The work of <hi>ſanctification</hi> is carried on pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſively in the hearts of the renewed, and will be continued until it is completed in the concluding moment of life; but regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration is the <hi>beginning</hi> of holineſs in the ſoul, and admits of no progreſſion. The point of time in which it is effected, is as indiviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as was that between the Almighty Fiat in the morning of the creation and the work done—<hi>GOD ſaid let there be light, and there was light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="unknown:036872_0023_100B270A398C96F8"/>
CHRISTIANITY is not anſwerable for the abuſes which have been made of the doctrine before us. There is nothing in it which countenances enthuſiaſtic impulſes, or a life of ſloth and wickedneſs. In regeneration men are made willing to enter into the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſervice which God requireth in his word, are placed under the dominion of the pure and benevolent ſpirit of the goſpel, and enter on a life of great vigilance and activity.</p>
               <p>IF it be not allowed that regeneration is an inſtantaneous change, ſome other nature muſt be attributed to it, than that which has now been deſcribed. If the change be grad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual; the old man and the new are not very wide apart; or there muſt be a middle char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter produced which no one can deſcribe, and which has no ſtate aſſigned to it in the retributions of eternity. If all men, as ſoon as they are brought into exiſtence, poſſeſs the ſeeds of virtue as an eſſential attribute of their nature, or have them implanted in their hearts by the Holy Ghoſt, it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that no <hi>eſſential</hi> change is neceſſary to fit any one of Adam's race for heaven. On this plan the loſt have the ſame general char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter with the ſaved; and the difference between them is to be aſcertained by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>degree</hi> of goodneſs to which the ſaved riſe, and which the loſt either do not acquire,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:036872_0024_100B270C9C53C520"/>or do not retain. What is this degree of goodneſs which conſtitutes regeneration? To find it we muſt draw a line ſomewhere between ſinleſs perfection and a ſtate of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regeneracy. What clue have we to guide us? The regenerate muſt be thrown into a labyrinth of perplexity, and be left without means to extricate themſelves, if they are to have recourſe to nothing for evidence in favor of their heirſhip to glory, but a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain degree of holineſs no where deſcribed in the word of God. The ſacred writings abound with deſcriptions of the fleſh and the ſpirit, their oppoſite natures and fruits; but they do not afford us any light in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining to what grade actions muſt riſe or fall, to conſtitute a holy, or a ſinful, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter. We cannot account for the ſtrain in which the ſcriptures proceed, if holineſs and ſin be not of contrary natures, and if there be not an eſſential difference between the characters of the righteous and the wicked.</p>
               <p>THE more attentively we examine the doctrine of progreſſive regeneration, the more fully it will appear that it is built on principles which deny the full extent of man's depravity, the neceſſity of an eſſential change of character; and which renders the work that paſſes on the renewed, little, if any
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:036872_0025_100B2711712E9380"/>thing, more than a renunciation of the forms of falſe worſhip, and a profeſſion of Chriſtianity, accompanied with a life ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally pure. Can this be the eſſence of that change which Moſes and the prophets, Chriſt and the apoſtles, make neceſſary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare men for the enjoyment of a holy God?</p>
               <p>ETERNAL life is promiſed to the ſmalleſt expreſſion of Chriſtian love, even the giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a cup of cold water to one in the name of a diſciple. How can we account for the glorious reward which ſo ſmall an action meets, if it were not grounded on a principle wholly different from that which gives birth to the ſhining actions of many impenitent ſinners? The true diſciples of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt are renewed in the ſpirit of their minds, and are prepared to bring forth good fruit. Hence, in the ſmalleſt holy actions they perform, they may collect evidence that they are members of Chriſt's myſtical body, and that they will be owned by him when he ſhall come to be glorified in his ſaints, and to be admired in all them that believe.</p>
               <p>THE thoughts which have been ſuggeſted on the ſubject to which we have been attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lead us to remark,</p>
               <p n="1">1. THAT the doctrine of regeneration is a plain and conſiſtent doctrine. It is reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both in the Old Teſtament and in the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:036872_0026_100B2712F4E1F6C0"/>New, and is an eſſential part of the plan of ſalvation which is proclaimed in the goſpel. The doctrine involves no abſurdity, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. It reſpects nothing in man but his character. It is this which is changed by the influences of the Holy Ghoſt. This change does not impair man's intelligent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor offer the leaſt violence to the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his will; but inclines him to love and ſerve God in the preſent world, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares him for the enjoyment of God in the world to come. If any will contend that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation is to be numbered among the dreams of a ſuperſtitious or a gloomy mind, they betary great ignorance both of God and themſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. WE may infer that the doctrine of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation does not relax the moral obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſinners, nor diminiſh the propriety of calling on them to repent and turn unto the Lord.</p>
               <p>As has been obſerved, man does not by his ſin drop his intelligent nature, nor ceaſe to be bound by the divine law, nor to be accountable to the ſupreme King. Be the diſpoſition of man's heart what it may, the homage which God requireth of him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth a reaſonable ſervice. The ſubjects of the divine moral government are as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to deſtroy their obligations to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:036872_0027_100B27159D8D27B0"/>as they are to annihilate themſelves, or to dethrone the Almighty. If nothing more were required of ſinners than they are inclined to do, their rebellion would ceaſe to be a ſin, the moral law would loſe its authority, and the ſalvation of ſinners, if it could be called ſalvation, would not be of grace, but of debt.</p>
               <p>THAT ſinners are called upon to repent and turn unto the Lord throughout the ſcriptures, can be denied by none who have attended to theſe writings. Though the calls of God's word and providence prove ineffectual, as we daily ſee, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety and reaſonableneſs of the divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands cannot be queſtioned. Impenitent ſinners are addreſſed as rational creatures, as voluntary agents, and as having an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite for happineſs and an averſion to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery. They may have a doctrinal belief of what the Lord requireth them to renounce, and what to embrace; and may feel a deep impreſſion of truth on their conſciences, while they refuſe to come unto Chriſt that they may have life. It is declared by the Saviour in the 20th verſe of the chapter which contains the text. <hi>That every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, leſt his deeds ſhould be reproved.</hi> Are the wicked not to be exhorted to come to
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:036872_0028_100B2718B6B474A0"/>the light, becauſe they hate it? Are the terms of ſalvation to be brought down to a level with the exerciſes of their rebellious hearts? The impenitent are not thus excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, nor is ſuch daring preſumption encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged, in the word of God. Let us attend to a few paſſages out of the many which might be quoted. Jere. iv. 14. <hi>O Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, waſh thine heart from wickedneſs, that thou mayeſt be ſaved: how long ſhall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?</hi> Mark i. 14, 15. <hi>Now, after that John was put in priſon, Jeſus came into Galilee, preaching the goſpel of the kingdom of God, and ſaying, The time is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, and the kingdom of God is at band: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent ye, and believe the goſpel.</hi> Acts xvii. 30. —<hi>God now commandeth all men every where to repent.</hi> James iv. 8, 9, 10. <hi>Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanſe your hands, ye ſinners; and purify your hearts ye double-minded. Be afflicted and mourn, and weep; let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heavineſs. Humble yourſelves in the ſight of the Lord, and he ſhall lift you up.</hi> Theſe few texts are a ſpecimen of the divine requirements from ſinners, and to what temper the promiſes are made. By the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent language of the lively oracles we muſt be convinced, if we attend with candor, that exerciſes of heart are required of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:036872_0029_100B271ADEDBA498"/>to which they are wholly oppoſed; and that if they will contend in the preſent caſe, they contend with God.</p>
               <p>THE ſubject now immediately before us, my friends, is a painful one to the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled heart. If any one doubt whether his heart be at enmity with God, let him attend to its exerciſes in himſelf when the divine command is in full view. If there be one now in the hearing of this diſcourſe who is charging God with being a hard maſter, be intreated to pauſe, and reflect on your character and ſtate with all the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, which becometh a dying accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creature. If the wickedneſs of your heart will juſtify you in not turning to God now, it will juſtify your impenitence here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and will ſecure you from puniſhment when you ſhall be arraigned at the bar of the Judge of the living and the dead. Will you dare ſtand up before him, and plead the enmity of your heart againſt him as an excuſe for not being reconciled to his gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment? Tremble at the thought of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a controverſy with God! Throw down the weapons of your rebellion, and ſubmit yourſelf to him.</p>
               <p>IT is a pleaſing ſight to the friends of Zion to behold ſinners rouſed from ſtupidity, reading the Bible, and anxiouſly inquiring
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:036872_0030_100B271C63144D08"/>what they muſt do to be ſaved. There is much more reaſon to hope that ſuch perſons will be brought to the knowledge of the truth, than thoſe who are ſecure in their ſins, who prefer any other book to the Book of God, and frequent the houſe of mirth. But when ſinners are ſolemnized, and have terrible apprehenſions of the wrath to come, no one ought to attempt to give them relief by aſſuring them that certain exerciſes of the impenitent heart ſecure to them a prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſe of being fitted for heaven. It is danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to give ſuch counſel; becauſe it is not warranted by the word of God, and becauſe it will, if believed, throw the awakened ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner into a ſtate of carnal ſecurity.</p>
               <p>O YE ſinners, of every deſcription, let not a deceived heart any longer turn you aſide. Do not flatter yourſelves with the hope of finding peace while you remain God's enemies. You muſt become recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to him or you muſt periſh forever. If you give up yourſelves to him, you will, on the one hand, cheerfully acknowledge your obligations to holineſs; and on the other, that ſovereign grace was diſplayed in bringing you into captivity to the obedience of Chriſt. This hath been the language of the redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of our race from the beginning to this day. May all our hearts accord with the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:036872_0031_100B271ECC93AA60"/>words of the apoſtle, <hi>Work out your own ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with fear and trembling: For it is God who worketh in you both to will and to do, of his good pleaſure.</hi> AMEN.</p>

               <p>THE ſcripture doctrine of regeneration is a ſtumbling-block to many, who have been educated under the light of the goſpel. They neither underſtand the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor acknowledge the neceſſity, of this change; and they exclaim, with Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, "How can theſe things be!" There are others who do not deny this doctrine, who conſider it as a ſubject rather ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive than uſeful. God grant that the words of Chriſt, in the text, may make a deep impreſſion on all our minds—<hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the kingdom of God.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="34" facs="unknown:036872_0033_100B27234E8A2718"/>
HAVING attempted to explain the nature of regeneration in my firſt diſcourſe, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in this to conſider the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of this change.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. THE moral depravity of man fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes proof, that no individual of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race can enter into the kingdom of heaven, except he be born again. In what this depravity conſiſts, or how it affects the mind, has been already ſhown. Let us at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for a moment, to the evidence that our moral nature is depraved.</p>
               <p>THAT all mankind are inclined to ſin is plain from the hiſtory of our race, from the date of Adam's tranſgreſſion to the preſent time. Experience has abundantly taught that all men, when left to the guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their own hearts, have uniformly and invariably tranſgreſſed the divine law, and have not choſen to retain God in their knowledge. The inſtances of piety to be found in ſome individuals form no objection to the preſent argument; becauſe all theſe pious perſons are monuments of divine grace. They who have not been guilty of ſin need no pardon. But no one of the human race has been ſaved on any other ground than that of the atonement which hath been made by Jeſus Chriſt. He is the Saviour of mankind, <hi>neither is there ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:036872_0034_100B2725D6F7E5E8"/>in any other; for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we muſt be ſaved.</hi> He did not come to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance. His plan of ſalvation neceſſarily implies that all mankind have apoſtatized, and are juſtly expoſed to everlaſting wrath. Thoſe who are ſaved by him are the moſt ready to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their native propenſity to ſin. The apoſtle Paul, in Rom. vii. ſpeaketh the language of them all, <hi>I know that in me (that is, in my fleſh) dwelleth no good thing.</hi> Real Chriſtians are moſt full in confeſſing that they ſee depravity every where among man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and that they daily feel it in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. If the good opinion which ſome profeſs to entertain of the human character be juſt, it is very ſtrange that thoſe perſons who are the pureſt in their walk, ſhould be the moſt ready to confeſs the wickedneſs of the heart.</p>
               <p>IF we ſurvey the conduct of mankind from the time of Adam to that of Noah, from Noah to Abraham, from Abraham to Moſes, from Moſes to David, from David to the coming of Chriſt, and from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt to the preſent day, we find facts without number to eſtabliſh the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of moral depravity. What impiety, idolatry, profaneneſs, injuſtice, rapine, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:036872_0035_100B27285118A5E0"/>uncleanneſs, envy, malice, and other ſins, have prevailed on the earth? How large a proportion of our hiſtory is written in characters of blood?</p>
               <p>WE cannot account for the wickedneſs which has been prevalent among mankind from bad example. An attempt to account for it in this way, is only to remove the difficulty a ſtep further back. The queſtion immediately ariſes, "How became bad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples ſo common?" Why do we find them not only among the Heathen nations, but among the deſcendants of the pious patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs? If there be no corrupt propenſity in the heart of man, why are not good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples as common as bad ones? We cannot avoid judging a tree by its fruit: And hence, if the fruit be corrupt, the tree muſt be corrupt.</p>
               <p>THAT the heart of man is wholly corrupt is explicitly and fully declared throughout the inſpired writings. Gen. vi. 5. <hi>And God ſaw that the wickedneſs of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.</hi> The force of the argument in ſupport of human depravity drawn from this text can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be evaded, by conſining this deſcription to the antediluvians; for it is declared by Jehovah, after the flood, in Gen. viii. 21.
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:036872_0036_100B272B7133D340"/>
                  <hi>I will not again curſe the ground any more for man's ſake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth.</hi> The character here given of man, is as applicable to the inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of the new world, as to the inhabitants of the old. It is particularly applied to the former, and conſidered as common to men of all ages and nations, from the early pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of life. If we ſhould grant that the inhabitants of the earth do not proceed to the ſame enormity of wickedneſs in the days ſubſequent to the deluge as in thoſe which preceded it, ſtill the ſame general character is aſcribed to man—<hi>his heart is evil from his youth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>MORE than a thouſand years after the flood, Solomon affirms, in his prayer at the dedication of the Temple, that <hi>there is no man that ſinneth not.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">I Kings viii. 46.</note> He expreſſes the ſame ſentiment more fully in Eccleſiaſtes vii. 20. <hi>For there is not a juſt man upon earth, that doeth good, and ſinneth not.</hi> Paul com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of a law in his members that warred againſt the law of his mind and brought him into captivity to the law of ſin. From the remaining corruptions in the hearts of good men in the preſent life, we may conclude that there is a native corrupt propenſity in the hearts of all mankind. David in li.
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:036872_0037_100B272CF3C1B9B0"/>Pſalm, when confeſſing his ſin in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Uriah, ſaith in the 5th verſe, <hi>Behold, I was ſhapen in iniquity; and in ſin did my mother conceive me.</hi> After every learned at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to explain away the obvious meaning of this paſſage, it remains as an explicit dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laration of the Pſalmiſt, that he felt fully convinced that he had a ſinful propenſity from the dawn of his exiſtence. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive bias of his heart was not different from that of any other of Adam's deſcendants: For we read in Prov. xxvii. 19. <hi>As in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter face anſwereth to face; ſo the heart of man to man.</hi> The prophet Jeremiah, in the xvii. chapter of his prophecy, ſaith of the human heart, without application to any individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, <hi>The heart is deceitful above all things,</hi> and <hi>deſperately wicked: who can know it?</hi> I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to you, brethren, who have ſtudied your hearts, whether you have any doubt of the juſtice of Jeremiah's deſcription? And whether in proportion as you have been ſearching into yourſelves, the words of the prophet have not appeared more and more juſt and ſtriking? Can you not ſay of this paſſage in particular—<hi>How forcible are right words?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>MY limits will permit me to introduce on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a few texts out of the many which might be cited in this place. I may not omit that
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:036872_0038_100B272FE2D16BF0"/>remarkable paſſage which is contained in Romans iii. beginning at the 9th verſe.— <hi>What then? are we better than they? No, in no wiſe: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under ſin; As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: There is none that underſtandeth, there is none that ſeeketh after God. They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. Their throat is an open ſepulchre; with their tongues they have uſed deceit; the poiſon of aſps is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their lips: Whoſe mouth is full of curſing and bitterneſs: Their feet are ſwift to ſhed blood: Deſtruction and miſery are in their way: And the way of peace have they not known: There is no fear of God before their eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE words contained in this paſſage are quoted from ſeveral Pſalms, and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Old Teſtament. <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm. x. xiv. xxxvi. liii. cxl. Prov. i. Iſaiah lix.</note> That theſe words imply a total depravity will not be denied. The only inquiry now before us is, whether the apoſtle confines them to a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed party of the Iſraelites, or of any other people, who lived in the times of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh kings and prophets, or extends them to all mankind of every nation and age. He muſt be underſtood to apply the words in the laſt ſenſe: For he introduces the paſſage
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:036872_0039_100B273197227088"/>with declaring that <hi>he had before proved both Jews and Gentiles that they are all under ſin.</hi> Jews and Gentiles include all mankind. After the apoſtle had mentioned that both Jews and Gentiles are all under ſin, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to confirm this point by uttering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the words of the Jewiſh ſcriptures "As it is written, There is none righteous, no not one"—and continues to ſketch the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the human heart through the whole paſſage. Further to ſhow that the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the whole human race falls within the apoſtle's deſign, it may be obſerved that he draws ſuch concluſions from the premiſes contained in the words quoted as demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that the depravity deſcribed in them extends to all mankind; verſes 19, 20. <hi>Now, we know, that what things ſoever the law ſaith, it ſaith to them who are under the law; that every mouth may be ſtopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. Therefore by the deeds of the law there ſhall no fleſh be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in his ſight: for by the law is the knowledge of ſin.</hi> The apoſtle mentions <hi>all the world</hi> as becoming guilty before God; which proves the univerſal extent of the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſcription of moral depravity. If the apoſtle did not deſign to extend the deprav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity he had deſcribed to all mankind, how would he conclude from it, as he doth, that <hi>no fleſh</hi>—no individual of the human race,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:036872_0040_100B273562495030"/>can be juſtified by the deeds of the law. If there were ſome individuals of Adam's poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, or even one, without ſin, there would be an exception from the common way of juſtification in the ſight of God through the atonement—that ſmall number of holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who never ſinned, or that individual who is ſpotleſs, can be juſtified by the deeds of the law. But the apoſtle makes no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. He ſaith by the deeds of the law ſhall <hi>no fleſh,</hi> be juſtified in his ſight. He denies that any exception is to be admitted. He further goes on to declare in the 23d verſe, <hi>For all have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God.</hi> He does not ſay that a few have ſinned, or that a ſtrong corrupt party in Iſrael in the times of the kings and proph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, or in any nation or age, have ſinned, but that <hi>All have ſinned.</hi> He repreſents <hi>all mankind</hi> as being deſtitute of the fear of God, and in the way to ruin. He adds in the 28th, 29th, and 30th. verſes, <hi>Therefore we conclude, that a man is juſtified by faith without the deeds of the law. Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not alſo of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles alſo: Seeing it is one God which ſhall juſtify the circumciſion by faith, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion through faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT being manifeſt that the paſſage deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of man's depravity in Rom. iii. is to be
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:036872_0041_100B2736E4C548C8"/>applied to every individual of the human race, it will follow that all mankind are, by nature, <hi>totally</hi> depraved, or that their hearts are wholly corrupt. However pure any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renewed perſons may be in their outward behavior, or however engaging in their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, they do nothing which is <hi>holy.</hi> In this ſenſe there is none of them that doeth good, <hi>no not one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT is not implied in the doctrine of total depravity, that all ſinners have an equal degree of guilt, or that they all commit crimes in the face of the world, or that they are as bad as they can be; but by to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal depravity is meant a heart which is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtitute of holineſs, and wholly in love with ſin. Every unregenerate perſon is an enemy to the true character of God; and were he under no reſtraint, he would, as temptations occurred, commit either of the crimes which is found in the catalogue of the works of the fleſh. <hi>From within, out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts, adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, fornications, murders, thefts, covetouſneſs, wickedneſs, deceit, laſciviouſneſs, an evil eye, blaſphemy, pride, fooliſhneſs: All theſe evil things come from within, and defile the man.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Mark vii. 21, 22, 23.</note> If we faithfully look into our hearts we ſhall ſee in them the ſeeds of every ſin, and ſhall
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:036872_0042_100B27392F3BA8D8"/>be convinced that no one can juſtly hope for the happineſs of Heaven without paſſing through the new birth. This change was as neceſſary for the agreeable young ruler who came to confer with Chriſt, in the courſe of his public miniſtry, as it was for Mary Magdalene; and it is equally neceſſary for all in every age of the world.</p>
               <p>SOME ſeem to ſuppoſe that if mankind be totally depraved, they muſt ceaſe to be moral agents. If their objection be valid, it will follow that any degree of depravity will, as far as it extends, take away man's obligations to ſerve the Lord. If the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates for partial human depravity will not abide by this conſequence, they muſt give up the preſent objection. Beſides, as has been ſhown, moral depravity reſpects noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but the heart, or the temper of the mind; and therefore whether it be partial or total, none of the powers of moral a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency are deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>Do we not find that the worſt of men are as voluntary in their actions as the beſt? The moſt vile are much more active in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the kingdom of darkneſs, than Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians are in promoting the kingdom of the Redeerner. <hi>The children of this world are in their generation wiſer than the children of light.</hi> No one will deny that Satan is totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:036872_0043_100B273B5F3C9CD0"/>and that he has riſen to a much higher degree of wickedneſs than his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren on the earth. Is he moved like a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine? Is he not a voluntary agent? He is active and unwearied in accompliſhing his infernal deſigns. He, <hi>as a roaring lion, walketh about, ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FROM the character of man by nature, we may determine that no one can ſee the kingdom of God, if he be not turned from ſin to holineſs, or be born again. The truth of this will more fully appear by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering,</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. THAT none but the pure in heart can enjoy communion with a holy God. <hi>Without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> This is the neceſſary and immutable conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of infinite wiſdom and benevolence. <hi>God is of purer eyes than to behold evil, and cannot look on iniquity. The fooliſh ſhall not ſtand in his ſight: he hateth all workers of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity. Can two walk together except they be agreed? What fellowſhip hath righteouſneſs with unrighteouſneſs?</hi> and <hi>what communion hath light with darkneſs?</hi> We cannot have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God ſo long as we refuſe to pay him the homage of our hearts. <hi>If we ſay that we have fellowſhip with him, and walk in darkneſs, we lie, and do not the truth.</hi>

The men of the world, in the preſent life, diſcover an averſion to the circles in which pure and undefiled religion is the theme. How could they endure the ſociety of the angels, and the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, where every heart is warmed with love, and every mouth is filled with praiſe? The wicked could frame a heaven which would ſuit their taſte, and in which they might dwell with their preſent temper. They could reliſh the pleaſures of a Mahometan paradiſe;
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:036872_0045_100B273F5A8181D8"/>but they have no real deſire for the Heaven in which the glorified ſaints and the holy angels dwell.

               </p>
               <p>LET none flatter themſelves with the hope of future happiineſs while they remain im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent; however fair may be their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, or however blameleſs may be their conduct in the eyes of men.

THE diſcourſe will be concluded with a few reflexions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. REGENERATION is a great change. The proud and rebellious heart is brought into obedience to the divine government, and God is choſen as the portion of the ſoul. The ſubjects of the new birth are called out of darkneſs into God's marvellous light. <hi>If any man be in Chriſt he is a new creature: old things are paſſed away; behold, all things are become new.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cor. v. 17.</note> The regenerate are made <hi>partakers of the divine nature,</hi> the moral im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of God loſt by the apoſtacy is reſtored to their hearts, and they are brought into his holy kingdom. <hi>God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved them, even when they were dead in ſins, hath quickened them together with Chriſt, and hath raiſed them up together, and made them to ſit together in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Eph. ii. 4, 5, 6.</note> Heaven is begun in their ſouls, they have a taſte for the things which God hath prepared for them that love him; and he who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun a good work in them will perform it until the day when the Saviour will appear in all his glory.</p>
               <p>ARE there any preſent who are born of God, you delight in his holy will, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy communion with him. You do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:036872_0047_100B27434B9AD728"/>enmity againſt him, but love his char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter, and cheerfully ſubmit to his domin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion. You are convinced that wiſdom's ways are ways of pleaſantneſs, and that all her paths are peace. What a new face has been put on the word and works of God in the view of your minds? When God man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifeſts himſelf to your ſouls, whether you are in the ſanctuary, in the cloſet, or in the midſt of your worldly buſineſs you can ſay, "It is good for us to be here." Would you exchange a place in Chriſt's family for all the pleaſures, the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and the honors of the world? A man full of malevolence does not taſte the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſtian love; a proud man is not charmed with humility; and an unbeliever is blind to the glory of Jeſus Chriſt. Do you not admire the pure, the diſintereſted nature of the divine benevolence? Can you expreſs in words how glorious the Saviour appears? Do you not delight in contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the character and work of Him, whoſe name is called <hi>Wonderful, Counſellor, The mighty God, the everlaſting Father, The Prince of peace?</hi> Do not his worth, his beauty and his glory ſometimes appear ſo plain, ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and raviſhing, as to impreſs your minds, for a moment, with a belief that you can convince the impenitent of their ſin and folly, and compel them to come to
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:036872_0048_100B27472E269728"/>the goſpel feaſt? Perhaps you have made the attempt in this ſeaſon of warmth, and have been taught by the experiment how unable you are to open the eyes of the blind. This hath ſerved to give you the deeper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of your dependence on ſovereign grace, and of the importance of keeping your place at the foot-ſtool of Him who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone can ſubdue the hearts of the diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. Are you not abundantly convinced that your former obſtinacy would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, if God, who is rich in mercy had not made you willing in the day of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? He hath cauſed you to flee from the wrath to come, and hath made you heirs of the heavenly inheritance. The Lord hath done great things for you: Be thankful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and bleſs his holy name.</p>
               <p>IT has been inquired, why, if regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be ſo great a change, it is no more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent in the ſubjects of it, to mankind in general? To this it may be replied, That the unholy are ſtrangers to the exerciſes of the renewed heart, and do not enter into the motives by which it is governed. The life of Chriſtians is hidden with Chriſt in God; Hence the world knoweth them not. Men who are ignorant of the power of godlineſs, are hable to form very erroneous opinions with reſpect to the manner in which real pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:036872_0049_100B274A6E9381F8"/>is to be expreſſed. Some ſeem to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that if any profeſs a religion which is not as much edified by gay amuſements, or the purſuits of wealth and ambition, as by an attendance on the worſhip of God, they muſt, to act conſiſtently, abandon temporal concerns, and retire from ſociety. Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians have, in times of perſecution, been compelled to wander in deſerts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth. But they are forbidden to withdraw from ſociety in ordinary ſeaſons. Should they do this, they would put themſelves out of the way of letting their light ſhine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men. Their hearts are not placed on earthly enjoyments as a portion; and they conſent to ſacrifice them all, and even life itſelf, when they cannot retain them without denying Chriſt. Diligence in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of temporal concerns is enjoined on Chriſtians by the divine law. In attending to theſe, they have occaſion to mingle with the enemies of their Lord. They do not chooſe ſuch for their intimate friends; but in their occaſional intercourſe with the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they may keep their garments undefiled, as Lot did in Sodom, and as Daniel did in the court of Perſia. Strangers to religion may think that ſince Chriſtians ſow and reap, buy and ſell, and tranſact other worldly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, in common with the reſt of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:036872_0050_100B274C3655F920"/>they are in reality the ſame. Hence their true character is overlooked, and their profeſſion is charged with hypocriſy.</p>
               <p>AGAIN, thoſe who are born of God ſoon loſe that warmth by which they are at firſt diſtinguiſhed. The careleſs and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane who obſerve this abatement, ſuppoſe that the ſubjects of it either counterfeited all their former zeal, or were carried away by an idle dream. Chriſtians are liable to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from God, but the decline of their firſt fervor is no certain evidence of their back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding from truth or duty. New converts are ſoon led to ſee that they have overrated their attainments, and go into the conflicts of the Chriſtian warfare; in which they become better acquainted with the divine character and their own, are more alive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and are better fitted to ſerve him in the preſent world, and to enjoy him in the world to come. While <hi>their love is abounding yet more and more in knowledge, and in all judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> they may be thought by the ungodly to have become lukewarm towards the cauſe of the Redeemer.</p>
               <p>IT is further to be conſidered that Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians are now in an imperfect ſtate. They are ſanctified but in part, and have much remaining ſin. By lapſes in their external behaviour they give occaſion to the wicked
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:036872_0051_100B274F71D5C448"/>to <hi>blaſpheme that worthy name by the which they are called.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AFTER all, it cannot be denied that thoſe Chriſtians who are much improved in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, exhibit in their practice ſuch a fixed purpoſe of cleaving unto the Lord, as leads the ungodly to take knowledge of them as having been with Jeſus. Hardened unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers look on the diſciples of Chriſt with an evil eye. They watch for their halting. They are glad to ſee them ſtumble. They cloſely inſpect their behaviour, and when they diſcover a fault they magnify it, and paſs ſentence in the ſevereſt manner. They ſcrutinize and they condemn with this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, to keep their own conſciences quiet while they are ſerving divers luſts and pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures. Deluded mortals! will the ſins of God's people ſcreen you from guilt? and furniſh a plea for your acquittal when you ſhall be arraigned at the bar of the Judge of all the earth? <hi>If the righteous ſcarcely be ſaved, where ſhall the ungodly and the ſinner appear?</hi> To return, bitter and cruel as may be the enemies of the Croſs, they are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times compelled to acknowledge, that Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians manifeſt a ſpirit of benevolence and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial which cannot be found in any other men. Scoffers have their ſeaſons of relen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and the monitor in their breaſt pays
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:036872_0052_100B275206E5B388"/>homage to the ſervants of the Moſt High God, and confeſſes them to be the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of the earth. Theſe have a command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dignity of character given them from above. Soon will they be publicly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the wicked, and will <hi>ſhine forth as the ſun in the kingdom of their Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. THE ſovereign mercy of God is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played in regeneration. As the hearts of the unregenerate are wholly oppoſed to God, they have no exerciſes which tend to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: And therefore when any are born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain their change muſt be attributed to ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign grace. The unregenerate are <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins,</hi> they have no latent ſpark of moral virtue in their hearts: And hence if any of them be renewed, they muſt feel that it is <hi>by grace they are ſaved; and that not of themſelves: it is the gift of God.</hi>— That is marvellous grace which giveth to man a heart to comply with the ſalvation of the goſpel, to which he is by nature whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſed. He cannot be the ſubject of the new birth, and fail of being deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impreſſed with the belief that no fleſh can have cauſe to glory before God. The apoſtle ſaith, in his addreſs to the ſaints, <hi>But of him are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us wiſdom, and righteouſneſs,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:036872_0053_100B275464AD7338"/>and ſanctification, and redemption; that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. i. 30, 31.</note>
               </p>
               <p>WHEN the ſinner is bowed to the divine will, he does not harbour a thought that he has diſtinguiſhed himſelf from the unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and rebellious around him; but he feels that ſovereign grace hath interpoſed for his ſalvation. <hi>God hath mercy on whom he will have mercy.</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. ix. 18.</note> On what other ground can we account for the large ingathering of ſouls into the Redeemer's kingdom on the day of Pentecoſt? The converts of that memorable day had lately manifeſted their approbation of the unjuſt and cruel ſentence which was executed in the death of Chriſt. Curioſity, or ſome worſe motive, drew them together when it was noiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad that the apoſtles ſpake with other tongues. But they had not been many hours aſſembled before they were pricked in their heart in the hearing of Peter's ſermon, and gladly received the goſpel which he preached. What a ſurpriſing change took place in them between the morning and the evening! Not only the converſions in Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, but thoſe in Antioch, in Theſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica, in Corinth, in Epheſus, and in other places, recorded in the New-Teſtament,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:036872_0054_100B275693ADFE90"/>proclaim the ſovereign mercy of God. In every age of the church, the ſaints have breathed the ſpirit of the Pſalmiſt. <hi>Not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's ſake.</hi>
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">Pſalm cxv. 1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>WE have ſeen perſons who were proud of their ſuppoſed religion, and whoſe words and actions courted applauſe for their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but we are certain that they did not learn that ſpirit in the ſchool of Chriſt. Spiritual pride is not from above; it is from beneath, and is a moſt abominable ſin. The children of God watch againſt it, and abhor themſelves and repent in duſt and aſhes for being in any inſtances inſnared by it. Their hearts breathe after God, and they give glory to his great name.</p>
               <p>THE ſcripture doctrine of regeneration takes away all ground of glorying in the fleſh. The ſovereign mercy of God mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſaved to differ from thoſe that periſh. The ſovereign mercy of God is the ſong of the ſaints in heaven this moment, and will be their triumph to eternity. They do not attribute it to themſelves that they are not among the damned. When they caſt their eyes acroſs the gulph which divides heaven from hell, and behold the puniſhment of
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:036872_0055_100B275A6BAF9800"/>the wicked, they are filled with admiration of the riches of free grace diſplayed in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuing them from the brink of endleſs miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and placing them in the world of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting happineſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. THE regenerate are under high and peculiar obligations to ſerve and praiſe the Lord. To you he hath given a heart to know him. <hi>Walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called. Abound in praiſe to Him who hath brought you up out of an horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pit, out of the miry clay, and ſet your feet upon a rock, and eſtabliſhed your goings.</hi> Walk as children of the light and of the day. Watch over your thoughts, your words, and your actions; and recommend religion by holy lives. Improve all your talents for the advancement of that cauſe to which your Lord devoted himſelf in life and in death. Praiſe God when he appeareth to build up Zion. May you ever find ſuch ſeaſons, times of great refreſhing to your ſouls. Contemplate the worth and glory of the Redeemer's kingdom, and count noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dear unto yourſelves that you may finiſh your courſe with joy. Reſt not in paſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments; but, <hi>forgetting thoſe things which are behind, and reaching forth unto thoſe things which are before, preſs toward the mark, for the prize of the high calling of God in Chriſt

Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Chriſt in God.

               <p>THEY who are born of God often call to mind their former character and ſtate. They will not forget theſe in any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of their exiſtence. The apoſtle Paul, after his converſion, looked back with deep ſorrow on his temper and conduct when he was an enemy to Jeſus Chriſt; and had a lively ſenſe of the riches of divine grace which had renewed his heart, and brought him into favor with God. All true Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians imitate him in ſuch reflections. The
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:036872_0058_100B2760AF3DEAF8"/>apoſtle includes himſelf with thoſe to whom he wrote, when he ſaith in the context and in the text, <hi>For we ourſelves alſo were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fooliſh, diſobedient, deceived, ſerving di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers luſts and pleaſures, living in malice and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, hateful, and hating one another. But after that the kindneſs and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared, not by works of right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs which we have done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us, by the waſhing of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt; which he ſhed on us abundantly through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour; that being juſtified by his grace, we ſhould be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHEN any of the children of men are turned unto God they cannot attribute the change in themſelves to any works of their own; but they are wholly indebted to his mercy for thoſe influences which inclined them to believe to the ſaving of their ſouls. They had performed no holy action before they were wrought upon from on high. There was nothing in their hearts which moved God to ſhow favor to them in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction from others. Their alienation from Him would have remained, if he had not <hi>according to his mercy ſaved them by the waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>

My deſign in diſcourſing from the text is, to conſider the Agency of the Holy Ghoſt in regeneration.</p>
               <p>THE Holy Ghoſt is one of the perſons of the Trinity. He is joined with the Father and the Son in the inſtituted form of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian baptiſm, and in the apoſtolic ſalutations to the churches; and is called GOD. <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts V. 4.</note> The men who were employed in penning the ſcriptures were inſpired by him. <hi>The proph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecy came not in old time by the will of man; but holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Pet. i. 21.</note> The Holy Ghoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended in a bodily ſhape, like a dove, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt, immediately after his baptiſm, and a voice came from Heaven, which ſaid, <hi>Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleaſed.</hi>
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">Matth. iii. 16, 17, Luke iii. 21, 22.</note> By this deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt upon the Son of God he was publicly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated as the Prophet, Prieſt, and King, of the Church. In alluſion to this he is called the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> or the <hi>Chriſt;</hi> each of which titles ſignifies <hi>The Anointed.</hi> The Holy Ghoſt is ſtiled the <hi>Comforter,</hi> in the xiv, xv. and xvi. chapters of John the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt. In the primitive ages of the church the Holy Ghoſt conferred a power of ſpeaking with tongues before unknown to the ſpeaker, a knowledge of future
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:036872_0060_100B27656AD8CFA0"/>events, and other miraculous gifts. Theſe have, long ſince, ceaſed in the church; and while they were continued, they were whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinct from the renewing or ſanctifying influences of the Holy Ghoſt. Miraculous gifts were ſometimes imparted to wicked men; and when they were beſtowed on good men, as they moſt generally were, they were of a different nature from thoſe influences of the ſpirit which renewed their hearts. If the Holy Ghoſt ſhould this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enable one of this congregation to ſpeak in the language of China, or acquaint him with an event paſſing in one of its cities, neither this ability, nor this knowledge, would prove the perſon to whom it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to be a ſubject of ſanctifying grace. The knowledge of a fact, and the renovation of the heart, are things of a different nature. Hence we could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine in favor of a man's piety, if he knew by an immediate revelation from God what will happen in a future period. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous gifts were of high importance ſo long as the canon of ſcripture remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiſhed. They were not continued beyond the infancy of the church; and we have no reaſon to expect their return. But ſhould they, contrary to the general expectation, be reſtored, they would not ſtand in the place of thoſe influences of the ſpirit which change
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:036872_0061_100B2766EFC18E30"/>men's hearts and fit them for Heaven. When the ſeventy returned to Chriſt after they had been ſent out by him to preach the goſpel and to confirm their miſſion by mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acles, they ſaid unto him <hi>Lord, even the devils are ſubject unto us through thy name.</hi> He replied, <hi>I beheld Satan as lightning fall from Heaven. Behold, I give unto you power to tread on ſerpents and ſcorpions, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing ſhall by any means hurt you. Notwithſtanding, in this rejoice not that the ſpirits are ſubject unto you; but rather rejoice, becauſe your names are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Heaven.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Luke x. 17—20.</note> The apoſtle Paul declares, in 1 Cor. xiii. <hi>Though I ſpeak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as ſounding braſs, or a tinkling cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and underſtand all myſteries, and all knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge; and though I have all faith, ſo that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE renewing influences of the Holy Ghoſt are common to all ages of the church; and were they wholly withdrawn, the work of regeneration would no more appear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong mankind, and Satan would reign in every heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="unknown:036872_0062_100B2768904C0EE0"/>
THE phraſe, <hi>renewing of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> in the text, muſt refer to his influences on the hearts of the ſaved, and to nothing elſe. To theſe influences the apoſtle attrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utes the ſtate of ſalvation into which he and other believers were brought. If an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial change of heart was neceſſary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare men for heaven heretofore, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary now; for the human character is the ſame. As man is totally depraved he will not return to God, unleſs he be influenced from on high, or by the Holy Ghoſt. We have the ſame evidence that a man muſt be <hi>born of the Spirit,</hi> as that he muſt be born again, to ſee the kingdom of God. If we conſider the texts which ſpeak of the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the Spirit of God, as confined to his miraculous operations, or to his agency during the firſt ages of the church, we ſhall do violence to the inſpired writings; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the kingdom of grace to a level with the kingdom of nature.</p>
               <p>THAT the Holy Ghoſt hath a ſpecial a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency in regeneration may be proved,</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. FROM the ways in which he operateth on the minds of the ſaved.</p>
               <p>IT is not denied that ſome are ſanctified from the womb. In inſtances of this kind we are compelled to acknowledge the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:036872_0063_100B276CEDB7FAC0"/>agency of the Holy Ghoſt; becauſe external means had not been enjoyed. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of this deſcription who have lived long enough to be able to communicate by words their internal exerciſes, have been full in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the doctrine of depravity, and the abſolute need of the influences of the Spirit of God to renew the heart. We hear the ſame confeſſion from the mouths of perſons appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently renewed in adult years, who cannot, as is moſt uſual, give a particular account of the time of their converſion. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of much higher importance to be able to trace in ourſelves the nature of true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, than the period of its commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the order of our exerciſes. We are to guard in this place againſt counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing the idea, that the tranſition from an unregenerate to a renewed ſtate, is like the growth of a plant from a ſmaller to a larger ſize. This opinion tends, like an opiate, to quiet the minds of the ſecure, and to leave them undiſturbed whilſt they put the form of godlineſs in the place of its power. It cannot be too deeply impreſſed on our minds, that there is an <hi>eſſential</hi> differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the characters of the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and the unregenerate. Hence it gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally happens that Chriſtians are able to give an orderly account of alarming appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:036872_0064_100B276F9E05F578"/>of the wrath to come, and of clear and ſtriking diſcoveries of the wickedneſs of the heart, which preceded their ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the divine will, when they beheld, with pleaſing wonder, the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>THE ſcriptures do not inform us what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of doctrinal light, how long a ſeaſon of ſerious thoughtfulneſs, or what degree of terror, will exiſt in the minds of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate previouſly to their renovation. Theſe are different in different perſons. The interval between the firſt alarm and converſion, appears to have been ſhort, in moſt, if not in all, of thoſe who were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed under the miniſtry of Chriſt, and that of his apoſtles. The knowledge and conviction which are obtained and impreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed during what has been called the <hi>prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory work,</hi> are of no ſmall uſe; in diſcloſing to ſinners their real character, in teaching them that they muſt be wholly indebted to ſovereign grace for ſalvation, and in aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in their walk when brought into cordial ſubmiſſion to the divine will. It has often been remarked that thoſe whoſe minds had been moſt ſtored with doctrinal knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge, are, other things being equal, the freeſt from imaginary flights during the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor which young converts feel, and ſhine
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:036872_0065_100B277123BD2798"/>brighteſt in the ſchool of Chriſt. But, to whatever attainments the unregenerate may riſe, whatever anxiety they may endure, or whatever exertions they may make, nothing which goes before the new birth can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a <hi>part</hi> of that change. Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is a work by itſelf; and in it a new heart is given—a heart to which the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed are ſtrangers. The ſpecial agency of the Holy Ghoſt in this work, appears from the incidents and means which have been made effectual to the converſion of ſinners. A ſew of theſe will be mentioned in this place.</p>
               <p>DEEP conviction has been known to be faſtened on the minds of perſons by their glancing at a few words in the Bible, or ſome other good book, without any deſign to ſeek for the paſſage, and far leſs to reflect with ſeriouſneſs on any religious ſubject. This conviction has been faſtened on their conſciences, and they have not been able to ſhake it off until God hath made them wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the day of his power. The like ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects have been ſeen to follow the dropping of a word in converſation, which contained nothing remarkable for pertinence, and was not uttered with any unuſual ſolemnity. This hath been made effectual; becauſe the time had come in which God had determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:036872_0066_100B277437BBB728"/>to ſave a ſoul from death, to ſave by ſuch ſimple means, and to add to the evidence that the excellency of the power is of Him. This ſubject of divine grace had perhaps lived long under an able and faithful preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the goſpel, and had heard many weighty and alarming thoughts uttered in religious converſation, but never till now felt the arrows of the Almighty piercing his ſoul.</p>
               <p>GOD hath laid ſome on a bed of ſickneſs, and hath brought them to the borders of the grave, to give them conviction that there is but a ſtep between them and eternal miſery, and hath followed this with the renewing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of his Spirit. We have ſeen how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, not a few who have been deeply a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed with their danger when death ſtared them in the face, and abounded with prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſes of amendment, who have, on the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toration of health, turned like the dog to his vomit, and the ſow that was waſhed to her wallowing in the mire. No promiſes of reformation can be relied on which do not ſpring from a heart that is purified by faith. We are furniſhed with ſo many facts to eſtabliſh this remark, that we muſt be highly criminal if we attribute the real refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations which ſometimes follow dangerous ſickneſs, to any other cauſe but the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:036872_0067_100B277768049D18"/>influences of the holy Spirit operating on the heart.</p>
               <p>SOME have derived everlaſting benefit from the death of their neighbors, friends, or companions. They have been alarmed, as was the Jailer by the earthquake which at midnight ſhook the foundations of the priſon, in which Paul and Silas were confined, burſt open its doors, and looſed the chains of the priſoners. Like the keeper of this priſon, they have been brought to believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and their ſorrow has been turned into joy.</p>
               <p>IT has been obſerved that ſudden and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing deaths, have not often been followed with the repentance of thoſe ſinners who have been called to witneſs the awful events. When one of their companions has been ſuddenly arreſted by the king of terrors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes, perhaps in the midſt of their wine and profane mirth, they have been filled with conſternation for the moment, and like Belſhazzar, <hi>the joints of their loins have been looſed, and their knees have ſmitten one againſt another;</hi> but no ſooner has the corpſe of their dead friend been laid in the grave, and an opportunity has preſented for a renewal of their diſſipation, than they have committed the ſame iniquity with gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:036872_0068_100B2779AFBCA078"/>and have haſtened to fill up the meaſure of their ſins. Theſe melancholy inſtances proclaim that madneſs is in the hearts of the ſons of men, and that the moſt diſtracting terrors will not prevail to divorce them from their luſts. Symptoms of approaching ruin attend ſuch hardened ſinners.</p>
               <p>IF remarkable, afflictive diſpenſations of providence were always ſet home on the hearts of men—if repentance always fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, we might be more liable than we now are to deny the agency of the holy Spirit in creating the new heart, and to forget that God hath mercy on whom he will have mercy.</p>
               <p>PARENTS are under high and peculiar obligations to train up their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. They have ſtrong inducements to be faithful to their offspring; not only from the rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which is due to the ſupreme Law giver, but from the hope that if they do their duty, as far as may be expected from imperfect creatures, their children will be brought to the knowledge of the truth. They who know the worth of their own ſouls cannot be unconcerned for the ſouls of others, and eſpecially for the ſouls of thoſe whom they have been inſtrumental in bringing into the
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:036872_0069_100B277B33C78228"/>world. The birth of a child will lead the heart of the pious parent to ſolemn medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and fervent prayer. <q>From me hath deſcended an immortal creature; who will either partake of the everlaſting joys of heaven, or endure the endleſs pains of hell. I give up my infant unto thee, thou Lord of all. Out of the mouth of this babe may praiſe be perfected. May Chriſt be formed in its heart, that it may be to the praiſe of the glory of thy grace. I do not aſk for it the riches and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors of the world, but I aſk for it ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and eternal bleſſings. O Lord, cauſe me daily to renew the dedication of my ſelf and my child to thee. Make me to feel how important and ſolemn is my truſt as a parent, and to <hi>walk within my houſe with a perfect heart.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>ABRAHAM ſaid unto God, O that Iſhmael</hi> might <hi>live before thee!</hi> He commanded his children and his houſehold to keep the way of the Lord. Joſhua reſolved <hi>as for me and my houſe, we will ſerve the Lord.</hi> When the pious patriarchs were about to leave the world, they called their children to the ſide of their dying beds, and charged them to be obedient to the laws of Jehovah, and to ſeek his bleſſing. The prayers, reſolutions and counſels of the ancient worthies have
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:036872_0070_100B277D62CF02C0"/>been imitated, in ſome degree, by godly parents in every age of the church. The ſucceſs of their labors has not been ſmall. Proverbs xxii. 6. <hi>Train up a child in the way he ſhould go; and when he is old he will not depart from it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE peculiar delicacy and tenderneſs of the female mind, give to mothers great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence in forming the manners of their off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring. To them alſo, in moſt inſtances, is committed the immediate care of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in that early period of life in which they are moſt ſuſceptible of impreſſions. While the pious mother beholds the ſmiles and pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty actions of the babe in her arms, and while ſhe watches the firſt dawnings of reaſon, ſhe cannot forget that it was born for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, nor ceaſe to pray for its immortal wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. As ſhe looks round on her little ones ſhe can adopt the language of the apoſtle, in his addreſs to the churches of Galatia, with particular application to her offspring, <hi>My little children, of whom I travail in birth again, until Chriſt be formed in you.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>THE counſels, the examples, and the prayers, of pious mothers have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably ſucceeded. Samuel was the ſon of his mother's vows—ſhe promiſed before his birth to give him unto the Lord all the days
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:036872_0071_100B277F27070720"/>of his life, to be devoted to his ſervice as a Nazarite. As ſoon as he was weaned ſhe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him up to the houſe of Eli in Shiloh, where he was educated according to her vow. He miniſtered before the Lord when a child, and by his wiſe and pious conduct rejoiced the heart of his mother, as ſhe brought him a little coat from year to year, when ſhe came up with her huſband to offer the yearly ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice. Early the Lord appeared to him in a viſion, and put his fidelity to the teſt in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring to Elithe deſtruction which was about to come upon his family. <hi>Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground. And all Iſrael, from Dan even to Beerſheba, knew that Samuel was eſtabliſhed to be a prophet of the Lord.</hi> He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in this office from childhood to old age. He judged Iſrael all the days of his life with great integrity and firmneſs, and holds a high rank among the ancient wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. Timothy, a godly miniſter, knew the ſcriptures from a child; for which he was indebted to his mother, whoſeexertions were bleſſed for his everlaſting good. He was the third in ſucceſſion, in the maternal line, who was numbered among the friends of the Redeemer. Grace is not hereditary; but the prayers of godly anceſtors are often anſwered in the beſtowment of ſpiritual bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings on their poſterity. Paul in writing to
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:036872_0072_100B27821AD15B40"/>Timothy ſaith, in 2 Epiſtle i. 5. <hi>When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt firſt in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am perſuaded that in thee alſo.</hi> Dr. Doddridge in his improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this paſſage, in his Family Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor, remarks,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Pious women may take encouragment from the ſucceſs of <hi>Lois</hi> and <hi>Eunice</hi> on <hi>Timothy,</hi> who proved ſo excellent and uſeful a miniſter; as perhaps ſome of the worthieſt and moſt valuable miniſters the church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> has ever been able to boaſt of, have had reaſon to bleſs God for thoſe early impreſſions which were made upon their minds by the religious inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of perſons in the ſame relations.</q>
               </p>
               <p>LET parents abound in fervent prayer for their beloved offspring. They will receive a glorious reward if their poſterity ſhould periſh. But God may cauſe happy effects to follow in the piety of their deſcendants, long after the praying parents have been cut off from the land of the loving. <q>The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of prayer may come at a much greater diſtance than we are apt to look for it. There is a remarkable anecdote handed down to us, reſpecting the fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous St. Auguſtine. He was the ſon of an eminently pious woman, whoſe name
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:036872_0073_100B27839FBF9040"/>was Monica, yet he was in his youth very looſe and diſorderly. One of his fellow-citizens, it is ſaid, ſeeing him paſs, reflected upon him with great ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, as a diſgrace to ſociety; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother made anſwer, that, after all he thought it impoſſible that the ſon of ſo many prayers ſhould periſh. And we know that in fact, he became in due time one of the moſt eminent champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for evangelical truth. There is not the leaſt doubt that many prayers, and eſpecially of this kind, may have their anſwer and accompliſhment after the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever that offered them had been many years ſleeping in the duſt.<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Witherſpoon's Sermon on the Religious Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Children, p. 18, 19.</note>

               </p>
               <p>PIOUS parents will be at the greateſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from attributing to any of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels or prayers a change in the hearts of their children, ſhould this happy event take place. They are deeply impreſſed with the belief, that their labors will be in vain, if God does not <hi>pour his Spirit upon their ſeed, and his bleſſing upon their offspring.</hi>

               <p>THE truths contained in the ſcriptures are the ordinary means which God render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth effectual to the ſalvation of men. To
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:036872_0074_100B2786CE1CA7D8"/>open, apply and enforce the doctrines and duties revealed in the ſacred writings, is the great deſign of a religious education, and of the goſpel miniſtry. When God hath been about to raiſe a church to himſelf in any place, he hath ſent thither one, or more, of his ſervants to proclaim the glad tidings of his grace, and hath put his word into the hands of that people. <hi>How ſhall they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him of whom they have not heard? and how ſhall they hear without a preacher?</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. x. 14.</note> If we long after ſouls in the bowels of Jeſus Chriſt, we ſhall improve every opening in providence to ſend preachers of the goſpel among the Heathen nations, and to bring them to an acquaintance with that holy Book which contains the words of eternal life. The attempts of philoſophers to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten the world have terminated in cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with greater darkneſs. The way of ſalvation is revealed only in the goſpel. To this we are required to take heed, as unto a light that ſhineth in a dark place. <hi>The ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are able to make us wiſe unto ſalvation through faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Let us attend unto the words of the apoſtle in 1 Cor. i. 21. <hi>For after that, in the wiſdom of God, the world by wiſdom knew not God, it pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſs of preaching to ſave them that believe.</hi> The grand ſubject of that
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:036872_0075_100B27890A9AA538"/>preaching which the wiſe men of the world have called <hi>fooliſhneſs,</hi> is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified.</hi> The doctrine of the crucified Saviour, confidered in its various connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions and relations, includes all the truths neceſſary to be known to obtain eternal life. The goſpel is cordially embraced by all who are ſaved. Rom. i. 16. <hi>For I am not aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the goſpel of Chriſt: for it is the power of God unto ſalvation to every one that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; to the Jew firſt, and alſo to the Greek.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>PLAIN, evangelical preaching, is better adapted to convince and awaken the minds of ſinners than any other means. But, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, inſtructive, and fervent as the preacher may be, he will labor with his hearers in vain if God do not take hold of their hearts by his ſpirit. The apoſtle Paul was the moſt ſucceſsful inſtrument in the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the goſpel that has been raiſed up, in any age, or country. He was inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in gathering many ſouls into the Redeemer's kingdom. No one has been more ready than he was, to attribute all the ſucceſs of his labors to divine influence: 1 Cor. iii. 6, 7. <hi>I have planted, Apollos wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; but God gave the increaſe. So then, neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="unknown:036872_0076_100B278B54D95B48"/>The moſt able, godly, and ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful miniſters in every period of the church, have been the moſt abundant in making the ſame declaration with the apoſtle. They have watched, and they have prayed, that they might not aſcribe to their gifts, to their diligence, or to their zeal, the glory which is due only to God. He will not ſuffer his highly favored ſervants to be exalted above meaſure; and hence, to check the aſpirings of pride, and to keep them at the foot-ſtool, he hath often made them endure ſome very humbling ſtroke of his rod.</p>
               <p>I HOPE that there are perſons preſent who have felt a divine energy accompanying a preached goſpel. Your hearts in their true deformity have been laid open to you in the light of divine truth. You are convinced that you need not look into the conduct of thoſe who are around you to find wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; you behold it in yourſelves <hi>written with a pen of iron, and with the point of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amond, and graven upon the table of your heart.</hi> You have been made to feel that the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence denounced againſt the wicked is point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt <hi>you,</hi> and that Chriſt alone can deliver you from the curſe of the law. When Chriſt revealed himſelf to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Samaria at Jacob's well, ſhe went into the city and ſaid to the inhabitants,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:036872_0077_100B278DF6F1C3F0"/>
                  <hi>Come, ſee a man which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Chriſt?</hi> What un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable beauty and glory do you behold in the way of ſalvation revealed in the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel? With what commanding yet pleaſing majeſty doth the word of God appear, when it becometh <hi>the ſavour of life unto life?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THERE are ſeveral paſſages of ſcripture in which men are ſaid to be <hi>begotten with the word of truth,</hi> or <hi>born again, by the word of God.</hi> The meaning of theſe cannot be that the heart which is totally depraved can be influenced to love a holy God, merely by holding up before it the light which ſhineth in his word. If objective light were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to produce an eſſential change of char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter, there could be no room for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of the Holy Ghoſt in the work of regeneration. The word doth not become the power of God unto ſalvation, only when it is made effectual by his ſpirit. The word is improved in the preparatory work, both to awaken and inſtruct the mind. It is God's uſual way when he bringeth an adult perſon into his kingdom, to make uſe of the truths revealed in the ſcriptures, to give light to the underſtanding, and conviction to the conſcience, before he changeth the heart. But we have no authority to affirm that the renovation of the heart is the <hi>effect</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="unknown:036872_0078_100B2790772E4C08"/>of the former light and conviction; becauſe many are the ſubjects of theſe who are never born of God.</p>
               <p>MEN are begotten with the word of truth, as it is in view of objects held up in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that holy exerciſes take place in their minds. The exerciſes of the renewed heart are directed towards the God, the law, the Saviour, and the Heaven revealed in the Bible. The ſacred volume is full of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to holineſs. Theſe are felt by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, and by theſe are they governed in their pious walk. They who are born again adopt the language of David, in Pſalm xix, <hi>The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the ſoul: the teſtimony of the Lord is ſure, making wiſe the ſimple. The ſtatutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes: The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever: the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether. More to be deſired are they than gold, yea than much fine gold; ſweeter alſo than honey, and the honey-comb. Moreover</hi> by them <hi>is thy ſervant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.</hi> The word of truth will not appear to any one of our apoſtate race in ſuch light and beauty, nor be received with ſuch love and delight, if God do not by his ſpirit firſt breathe on his
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:036872_0079_100B2793841D3900"/>heart. When Paul preached at Philippi, <hi>the Lord opened the heart of Lydia, that ſhe attended unto the things which were ſpoken of the apoſtle.</hi> Had ſhe not been thus influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Holy Ghoſt, ſhe would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained In impenitence and unbelief like many others in the city where ſhe reſided. The hearts of all who are ſaved are firſt opened by the ſpirit of God, to incline them to receive the truths contained in the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word.—I proceed to obſerve,</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. THAT the ſpecial agency of the Holy Ghoſt in the new birth, appears from the <hi>peculiar call</hi> which is given to the regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate.</p>
               <p>THE works of nature and providence ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mankind inexcuſable in their atheiſm and wickedneſs. <hi>The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament ſheweth his handy work. The inviſible things of him from the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the world are clearly ſeen, being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the things that are made, even his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal power and Godhead.</hi> Thoſe who live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the light of divine revelation have a much higher call to love and ſerve God. To them he hath clearly made known his character and will. Before them are ſet life and death, in a plain and ſtriking manner, in the word of truth. Whatever impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:036872_0080_100B279507A1E738"/>are made on the conſciences of thoſe who die in their ſins, by the Holy Ghoſt, he never takes hold of their hearts. There is a call of the ſpirit of God which is effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in every inſtance, and is of a different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from any one which is given to them that periſh. This is a doctrine plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the ſcriptures. In ſupport of it a number of paſſages will be produced; to to which let us give our careful and ſerious attention.</p>
               <p>THE firſt paſſage I ſhall introduce is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in Rom. viii. 28, 29, 30. <hi>And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are THE CAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LED according to his purpoſe. For whom he did foreknow he alſo did predeſtinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firſt-born among many brethren. Moreover, whom he did preaeſtinate, them he alſo CALLED; and whom he CALLED, them he alſo juſtified; and whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified.</hi> It is manifeſt from the words of the apoſtle in this place that <hi>the called</hi> are the ſame with thoſe who <hi>love God,</hi> the ſame with thoſe who are <hi>juſtified,</hi> and the ſame with thoſe who will be <hi>glorified:</hi> Their calling muſt therefore be peculiar to themſelves. If we do not grant this, we muſt admit that ſome unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate men love God, are juſtified, and
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:036872_0081_100B2798214E3AD8"/>may, with their preſent character, be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; all which ſuppoſitions are falſe and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſcriptural. 1 Cor. i. 26. <hi>For ye ſee your CALLING, brethren, bow that not many wiſe men after the fleſh, not many mighty, not many noble are CALLED.</hi> The apoſtle cannot mean that the wiſe men after the fleſh, the mighty, and the noble, are not called by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word. He preached to men of this deſcription when he ſtood on Mars' hill in Athens, and he preached to them in other places. They are externally called by the works and the word of God as truly as men of the lower ranks in life, and as the ſaved. He muſt therefore mean by the <hi>calling</hi> in this text, that peculiar inward call which is given to thoſe who are brought into the kingdom of God. Ephes. iii. 7. <hi>Whereof I was made a miniſter, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.</hi> This effectual working of divine power which made Paul a Chriſtian and a miniſter, was ſomething wholly different from any thing that he was the ſubject of when he ſat at the feet of Gamaliel, when he was rejoicing in the dying groans of Stephen, or in the beginning of his journey to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus, when he breathed out threatnings and ſlaughter againſt the diſciples of the Lord. The energy of God's power men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the words juſt cited, was that ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:036872_0082_100B279A51E37BA8"/>operation of the Holy Spirit which chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his heart, and made him a real and a zealous friend to Jeſus of Nazareth. Eph. iv. 4. <hi>There is one body, and one ſpirit, even as ye are CALLED</hi> in one hope of your <hi>CALLING.</hi> Believers are the perſons here addreſſed. There is a <hi>calling</hi> common to them all—they have the ſame hope of heaven. There is nothing in this text which countenances the idea that the calling of unbelievers is of the ſame general nature with that which believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have; but the calling is conſidered as peculiar to the latter. 1 Timothy vi. 12. <hi>Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art alſo CALLED.</hi> The <hi>calling</hi> of Timothy implies the ſame with his being made an heir of glory.</p>
               <p>AFTER the remarks which have been made on the texts quoted in ſupport of the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar call given to the regenerate, it will be unneceſſary to comment on the following. 2 Timothy i. 9. <hi>Who hath ſaved us, and CAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LED us with an HOLY CALLING, not according to our works, but according to his own purpoſe and grace, which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus before the world began.</hi> Heb. iii. 1.—<hi>Holy brethren, partakers of the HEAVENLY CALLING.</hi> Jude i.—<hi>To them that are ſanctified by God the Father, and preſerved in Jeſus Chriſt, and CALLED.</hi> Rev. xvii. 14. <hi>Theſe ſhall make
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:036872_0083_100B279CA8063F10"/>war with the Lamb, and the Lamb ſhall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings; and they that are with him are CAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LED, and choſen, and faithful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE foregoing and ſimilar ſcripture paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages prove, that the regenerate are the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of a call from God of which the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate are not partakers. In the new birth a call is given by the ſpirit of God, which is different in <hi>kind</hi> from any which is given to thoſe who die in their ſins. This peculiar call is what Calviniſtic divines have ſtiled <hi>Effectual Calling.</hi> It muſt follow from the doctrine of total depravity that in regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration a will is given by the ſpirit of God, to which the former will of the ſubject of this change was wholly oppoſed.</p>
               <p>ARE there any preſent who have paſſed from death unto life, and can clearly trace the exerciſes of their own minds which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded this change, to you I appeal in partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular, in ſupport of the doctrine of ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign efficacious grace diſplayed in regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Did you not when firſt alarmed with terrible apprehenſions of future miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſtrive to baniſh thoſe fears, by running into vain company, by buſineſs, or in ſome other way? Did you not exert yourſelves to quiet your conſciences by doings which fall eſſentially ſhort of reconciliation to God?
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:036872_0084_100B279FD5DE1D30"/>Did you not contend with him becauſe he would not give you peace ſhort of uncondi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſubmiſſion to his will? Did you not complain of him for condemning you for ſin, and for requiring of you a holy heart? Did you not within yourſelves cavil at the doctrines of grace, and call God a hard maſter? What wicked excuſes did you frame to juſtify your obſtinacy in refuſing to turn unto him? What horrid thoughts of the glorious majeſty of heaven and earth did you indulge? You know—you feel, that if God had not ſtopped you in your dreadful career, and ſilenced your objections by his ſpirit, you would have remained his enemies, and have gone on to fit yourſelves for everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtruction. You cannot attribute the change of your hearts to any of your exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but you aſcribe it to Him who is rich in mercy. The God of all grace hath called you unto his eternal glory by Chriſt Jeſus: To Him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. AMEN.</p>

               <p>BLESSED be God, that, amidſt the abounding wickedneſs of mankind, a church hath been preſerved in the world, and will be continued on the earth to the end of time. Jeſus Chriſt hath received power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal life to as many as the Father hath given him. Theſe are ſanctified and made monuments of divine mercy.</p>
               <p>In the laſt diſcourſe it was ſhown that the Holy Ghoſt hath a ſpecial agency in regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration, from the ways in which he operateth
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:036872_0086_100B27A3B1853730"/>on the minds of the ſaved, and from the peculiar call which is given to the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. I proceed to obſerve,</p>
               <p n="3">3dly. THAT the Holy Ghoſt is given to the regenerate in a peculiar ſenſe. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from what was obſerved under the laſt head, but will be more fully conſidered in this place, together with the abiding influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the Holy Ghoſt in the hearts of thoſe who are born again.</p>
               <p>THE Holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh to all men in the ſcriptures; but many who are acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with theſe writings diſobey his voice, or reſiſt him. In this ſenſe are we to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the words of Stephen, addreſſed to his murderers, in Acts vii. 51. <hi>Ye ſtiff-neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and uncircumciſed in heart and ears, ye do always reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt: as your fathers did, ſo do ye.</hi> The ſpirit of God may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs truth on the <hi>conſciences</hi> of the wicked, as he doth in a time of awakening; but their <hi>hearts</hi> are not touched by this kind of impreſſion, and they are as really the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of holineſs as they were when they were ſtupid and thoughtleſs, and as blind to its beauty. When Chriſt promiſed to his diſciples, in John xiv. 16, that he would pray the Father, and that the Father would give them another Comforter, he added, in the following verſe, <hi>Even the Spirit of truth;
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:036872_0087_100B27A53857DBD0"/>whom the world cannot receive, becauſe it ſeeth him not, neither knoweth him.</hi> That the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate are involved in moral blindneſs is alſo manifeſt from 1 Cor. ii. 14. <hi>But the natural man receiveth not the things of the ſpirit of God; for they are fooliſhneſs unto him: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he know them, becauſe they are ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itually diſcerned.</hi> Jude, ſpeaking of men who walk after their ungodly luſts, ſaith, in the 19th verſe of his epiſtle, <hi>Theſe are they who ſeparate themſelves, ſenſual, having not the ſpirit.</hi> If the unregenerate do not receive the ſpirit of truth, if the things of the ſpirit are fooliſhneſs unto them, and if they have not the ſpirit as a Sanctifier, they are not the ſubjects of that <hi>kind</hi> of influence from him which renews the heart.</p>
               <p>CHRIST ſaith to his diſciples, in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited John xiv. 17. after declaring that the world knoweth not the Spirit of truth—<hi>But ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and ſhall be in you.</hi> That the Holy Ghoſt dwelleth in the hearts of believers is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from many texts recorded in the inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed writings. 1 Cor. iii. 16. <hi>Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</hi> 2 Cor. vi. 16. <hi>And what agreement hath the temple of God
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:036872_0088_100B27A83950E1D0"/>with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath ſaid, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people.</hi> True holineſs, or love, is communicated to the hearts of believers by the Holy Ghoſt, whereby a foundation is laid for them to enjoy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Father and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt. The Holy Ghoſt dwelleth in the hearts of believers by his ſanctifying and quickening influences, keepeth alive the holy temper begun in them, and traineth them up for the heavenly ſtate. To them the apoſtle ſaith in Eph. i. 13, 14. <hi>In whom</hi> (i. e. in Chriſt,) <hi>ye alſo truſted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the goſpel of your ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; in whom alſo, after that ye believed, ye were ſealed with that holy ſpirit of promiſe, which is the earneſt of our inheritance, until the redemption of the purchaſed poſſeſſion, unto the praiſe of his glory.</hi> No unregenerate man ever was the ſubject of that <hi>kind</hi> of influence from the holy ſpirit, which is the <hi>earneſt</hi> of the heavenly inheritance, as all are who are born again.</p>
               <p>FROM what has been ſaid we may deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that the Holy Ghoſt is given to the regenerate in a peculiar ſenſe. To ſpeak in the words of the late <hi>Preſident Edwards,</hi> in
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:036872_0089_100B27A9C2B826D8"/>his excellent Treatiſe on Religious Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <q>Thus not only the manner of the relation of the Spirit, who is the <hi>Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> to the ſubject of his operations, is different; as the Spirit operates in the ſaints, as dwelling in them, as an abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing principle of action, whereas he doth not ſo operate upon ſinners; but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and <hi>operation itſelf</hi> is different, and the <hi>effect wrought</hi> exceeding different. So that not only the perſons are called <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> as having the Spirit of God dwelling in them; but theſe qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, affections and experiences that are wrought in them by the Spirit are alſo <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> and therein differ vaſtly in their nature and kind from all that a natural man is or can be the ſubject of, while he remains in a natural ſtate; and alſo from all that men or devils can be the authors of: 'Tis a ſpiritual work in this high ſenſe; and therefore above all other works is peculiar to the Spirit of God.<note n="*" place="bottom">Edit. 2d, p. 137, 138.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>To argue from the ſufficiency of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement made by Jeſus Chriſt for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all men, that a portion of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the Holy Ghoſt is put into the hearts of all men, is an erroneous way of
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:036872_0090_100B27ABEE58F5B0"/>reaſoning. By the atonement a foundation is laid for the ſalvation of ſinners, and in conſequence of this they are placed in a ſtate of trial; but this does not imply that they have any influences of the ſpirit operat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on their heart, or temper of mind. We cannot find any where in the ſcriptures that the holy ſpirit dwelleth in the hearts of any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the regenerate. He is given to them in a peculiar ſenſe, as has been proved. The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement is a work <hi>without</hi> us, and by it is opened a door for our return to God. But we cannot infer from this that the heart or temper <hi>within</hi> us is altered. Impenitent ſinners are as really the enemies of God, as if no atonement had been made. Not one of them will ever return to God if his heart be not changed by the holy ſpirit. God lays reſtraints on the external conduct of the wicked in their ſtate of probation: If he did not, we do not ſee how the church could have been preſerved on the earth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a conſtant ſeries of miracles; but the reſtraints under which they are laid does not reſpect the temper of their hearts. The impenitent remain oppoſed to God, and are more criminal in their rebellion than if Chriſt had never appeared: John xv. 22. <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken unto them they
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:036872_0091_100ADCD4760E5160"/>had not had ſin: but now they have no cloak for their ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE words in John i. 9, applied to Chriſt, <hi>That was the true Light, which light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every man that cometh into the world,</hi> have been brought to prove, that in conſequence of the atonement made by him, a portion of the influences of the Holy Spirit hath been put into the heart of every individual of the human race. In reply it may be obſerved,</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. THAT if the Holy Spirit dwell in the hearts of all men, then all men are the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of true holineſs in ſome degree. But according to the ſcriptures all men are by nature dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, and there is not one of them while in unregeneracy that doeth good. The ſpirit of God may awaken the conſciences of ſinners, as he doth in the preparatory work, but this is a very different thing from taking hold of their hearts. When he dwelleth in the hearts of any, their temper, or diſpoſition of mind, accords with his holy nature in ſome degree; and therefore if he dwell in the hearts of all men, it muſt follow of courſe that all men are the ſubjects of true holineſs. That
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:036872_0092_100B27B048F9B6D8"/>this is not the true character of mankind has already been proved.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. IT appears from the two verſes next following the text under conſideration, that Chriſt doth not dwell in the hearts of all men by his ſpirit, in the ſame general ſenſe; <hi>He was in the world, and the world was made by him; and the world knew him not. He came unto his own, and his own received him not.</hi> By <hi>the world</hi> is here meant the <hi>Gentile</hi> world, and by <hi>his own,</hi> the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were Chriſt's kindred according to the fleſh, and were his by profeſſion. When he came into the world the generality of mankind rejected him, and have manifeſted the ſame temper from that day to the preſent. This enmity to the Son of God is wholly unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable if there be even a ſmall ſpark of holineſs implanted in their hearts by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly. WHEN Chriſt is ſaid to lighten ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery man that cometh into the world, the meaning is, that Chriſt is the great lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that holdeth up moral light before all men. He is the <hi>Word,</hi> or the manifeſter of the Deity to intelligent creatures. The whole creation is his immediate work, and he upholdeth all things by the word of his
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:036872_0093_100B27B383C1DA60"/>power. In theſe reſpects he holdeth up light before all mankind. In addition to theſe means of knowledge, he hath given to ſome the written word or the holy ſcriptures. Thoſe who are ſaved, are divinely illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his ſpirit. Thus all the light in the moral creation proceedeth from Chriſt as the immediate fountain. The text thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained affords no countenance to the opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion that all men have a portion of the Holy Spirit put into their hearts.</p>
               <p>THOSE who contend that the Holy Spirit is given to all men in the ſame general ſenſe, muſt hold, as many of them openly do, that the ſaved make themſelves to differ from them that periſh; and that, for inſtance, God did not impart any other or different influences of his ſpirit to Saul of Tarſus in the moment of his converſion, than he had imparted to Judas Iſcariot. However abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant the advocates of this opinion may be in the uſe of the phraſes <hi>Goſpel grace, free grace,</hi> &amp;c. and whatever profeſſions they may make of aſcribing the whole of man's ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to the mercy of God, their ſcheme of doctrine directly tends to encourage a proud and ſelf-righteous ſpirit.</p>
               <p>THE text in 1 Cor. xii. 7. <hi>But the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the ſpirit is given to every man to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:036872_0094_100B27B50C0506C0"/>withal,</hi> has been adduced in ſupport of the opinion that the ſpirit of God is given to all men in the ſame general ſenſe.</p>
               <p>To determine the meaning of this paſſage, let us conſult the context, begining at the 4th verſe, <hi>Now, there are diverſities of gifts, but the ſame ſpirit. And there are differences of adminiſtrations, but the ſame Lord. And there are diverſities of operations, but it is the ſame God which worketh all in all. But the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the ſpirit is given to every man to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit withal. For to one is given by the ſpirit the word of wiſdom; to another the word of knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge by the ſame ſpirit; to another faith by the ſame ſpirit; to another the gift of healing by the ſame ſpirit; to another the working of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; to another phrophecy; to another diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſpirits; to another diverſe kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues: But all theſe worketh that one and the ſelf-ſame ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, dividing to every man ſeverally as he will.</hi> It is plain that the apoſtle is here diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the <hi>gifts</hi> and not the graces of the ſpirit. Theſe have no neceſſary connexion, as has been before obſerved. The ſpirit of God came upon Balaam, and upon King Saul, and they both propheſied; but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them had any true religion. <note n="*" place="bottom">Numb. xxiv. 2. 1 Sam. x. 10.</note> When
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:036872_0095_100B27B838A530B0"/>the apoſtle ſaith that <hi>the manifeſtation of the ſpirit is given to every man to profit withal,</hi> his meaning is, that whatever miraculous or other gifts, have been imparted to any mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Chriſtian church, ought to be improved for the profit or edification of the whole body. The <hi>faith</hi> which is mentioned in the context is of the extraordinary kind, or of a kind which is not common to believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; as it is enumerated among the other gifts, and repreſented as not being poſſeſſed by all to whom the ſpirit is given. Since, therefore the apoſtle here confines his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, no argument can be drawn from the 7th verſe in ſupport of the opinion that the ſpirit of God dwelleth in the hearts of all men.</p>
               <p>IN a review of the agency of the Holy Ghoſt in regeneration, we may learn,</p>
               <p n="1">1. MAN'S obſtinacy in wickedneſs.

The ſame corrupt character has been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by mankind in every age ſince ſin entered into the world. They know that they muſt die, and they daily ſee their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low creatures dropping into the grave, but they continue to place their affections on the world as their ſupreme good, and to conduct as if the preſent ſtate of exiſtence were their final one. They are not diſpoſed to break off from their ſins and to ſecure an intereſt in the divine favor, by hearing of the ſolemnities of the erernal world and the judgment-day, as proclaimed by infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite truth. No arguments, no warnings, no perſuaſions, no entreaties, addreſſed to men by the providence and word of God, have ever been ſufficient, of themſelves, to prevail with an individual to repent of his ſins.

Were man's oppoſition to holineſs to be overcome without the renewing influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the Spirit of God, he would not be chargeable with his preſent madneſs and folly, nor would his conduct be ſo aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>The heart of the ſons of men is fully ſet in them to do evil;</hi> and will not be inclined to any thing elſe under the greateſt external light, if God do not change it by his Spirit. If there were but one ſuch obſtinate perſon to be found on the earth, how would all the reſt of mankind cry out againſt him as a monſter of wickedneſs! Is this character the leſs abominable, becauſe it is the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter of countleſs millions? When the eyes of the ſinner are opened he is filled with aſtoniſhment at himſelf— <q>What have I done!—How have I ſpent my life!— What counſels, warnings and invitations have I withſtood!—How juſtly do I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all the puniſhment with which ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are threatened in the Bible!—God's juſtice would ſhine brightly in my deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction! —If he leave me to myſelf, I am undone forever!</q>

2. WE may infer that thoſe are highly criminal who treat with contempt the agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Holy Spirit in preparing men for Heaven. Such perſons deny a doctrine which is plainly taught in the ſcriptures; and by ſure conſequence flatter themſelves and others with the belief of poſſeſſing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and purpoſes to which they are ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
               <p>MEN may walk, may till the ground, and may do any of the common actions of life, without any other influence of the Deity than that which pervades the univerſe, and upholds all creatures in exiſtence. By the ſame influence they may read the Bible, learn its doctrines, and attend public wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Their moral agency is not infringed by their perfect dependance on God. The worſt of men know when they reflect on the operations of their own minds that they act freely; and that though they dread puniſhment, they love ſin, and are therefore without excuſe in their wickedneſs. They are with as much propriety commanded to ſerve the Lord, as if they were inclined to obey; but they will not ſerve him unleſs their hearts are renewed by the Holy Spirit. If he do not form their hearts to holineſs
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:036872_0100_100B27C4F7579270"/>they will die in their ſins. Perſons who deny any ſuch operation have no right knowledge of God, or of themſelves; and are in imminent danger of being given up to believe a lie, and to endleſs deſtruction.</p>
               <p>THERE is a ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt which is never forgiven. Matth. xii. 31, 32. <hi>Wherefore I ſay unto you, All manner of ſin and blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven unto men: but the blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall not be forgiven unto men. And whoſoever ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a word againſt the Son of man, it ſhall be forgiven him: but whoſoever ſpeaketh againſt the Holy Ghoſt, it ſhall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</hi> When we conſider the miraculous atteſtations given by the Holy Ghoſt to the Chriſtian religion in its infancy, and the neceſſity of his renewing influences to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a church on the earth, we may deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt is a crime of high magnitude. It is not my deſign to attempt to give a preciſe definition of this ſin; but it is obvious that it is not committed in ſecret. The perſon who is guilty of it, <hi>ſpeaketh againſt the Holy Ghoſt, or openly blaſphemeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>MY aim in remarking on the public na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the unpardonable ſin, is, to caution
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:036872_0101_100B27C7847CD590"/>perſon in diſtreſs of mind about their future ſtate againſt deſpairing of mercy, when they have not committed <hi>the ſin which is unto death.</hi> Any ſin however ſmall, is damning if not repented of; but no one ought to conſider himſelf as certainly given up to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, on account of ſecret tranſgreſſions, or on account of any act of wickedneſs which does not involve open inveterate blaſphemy againſt the ſpirit of God, after having made the faireſt profeſſion of friendſhip to Chriſt which can be made by an enemy, and after having been a ſubject of the greateſt light which is found in an unregenerate man. Let all at the ſame time remember, that if they ſcoff at the power of godlineſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main hardened after the work of God in the converſion of ſinners, has been carried on before their eyes, their ſtate is highly alarming. It has been obſerved when the ſpirit of God cometh into a congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to an unuſual degree, that thoſe who continue impenitent, often become in the cloſe of ſuch ſeaſons more vicious than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; or elſe they embrace ſome ſcheme of ſentiment which encourages them with the hope of future happineſs without an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial change of character.</p>
               <p n="3">3. THE agency of the Holy Ghoſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:036872_0102_100B27C9E8B829F0"/>affords great encouragement to pious miniſters, godly parents, and other Chriſtians, to be faithful and unwearied in counſelling and warning the wicked.</p>
               <p>IF the ſervants of God do not ſucceed in their attempts to lead ſinners to repentance, they will be obedient inſtruments of God's declarative glory, will advance the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his holy kingdom, and will be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly rewarded for their labors of love. But they may not give up the hope of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs on account of the preſent obſtinacy of thoſe whom they are endeavoring to reclaim. The inſtruction and warning which are now without any good effect, may be rendered effectual in ſome future period. The God who commandeth his ſervants to ſpeak, is able to give a hearing ear and an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding heart to any of the children of men.</p>
               <p>WHAT a wonderful alteration is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeen, within a ſhort time, in families, in neighborhoods, and in large communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties! The ſtupid are awakened, feel their danger, and with deep ſolicitude make the inquiry, <hi>What muſt we do to be ſaved?</hi> They fly to Chriſt as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows. They now recal the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and the private counſels which they
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:036872_0103_100B27CC28FE2FB8"/>had heard with indifference; and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acknowledge the Almighty power that hath bleſſed theſe means, and hath inclined them who once turned a deaf ear, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come obedient to the wiſdom of the juſt. Now they pay the tribute of gratitude to thoſe who reſtrained them by their admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and awed them by their example, whilſt they were alienated from the life of God. But they will not forbear to confeſs that they had forever remained blind, and had deſtroyed themſelves, if infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy had not interpoſed for their ſalvation. However evangelical, enlightening and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent the preaching had been under which they had lived, and however faithful and zealous Chriſtian friends had been in their endeavors to win them to Chriſt, reclaimed ſinners know that GOD, and he only wrought the change which hath guided their feet into the way of peace. His conduct appears to them very marvellous in bleſſing the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of feeble mortals for the everlaſting good of their ſouls.</p>
               <p>CHRISTIANS of every rank and ſtation in life, ſo far as they are ſanctified, keep their place at the footſtool of the ſupreme King, ſpeak the words which he hath commanded,
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:036872_0104_100B27BF818C35B0"/>perform the duties which he hath enjoined, and are willing to leave the effects of their labors with Him whoſe counſel ſhall ſtand, and who will do all his pleaſure. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of Heaven and earth is highly provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, when creatures are diſſatisfied with the humble ſtation aſſigned them, when they propheſy out of their own hearts, when they refuſe implicit obedience to his will, and when they preſume to dictate to him how to direct their exertions. Let the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters of the word fix their eyes on the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolic model, and place their dependance on the ſame grace which wrought ſuch won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the infancy of the Chriſtian church. 2 Cor. x. 3, 4, 5. <hi>For though we walk in the fleſh, we do not war after the fleſh: (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of ſtrong holds;) Caſting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itſelf againſt the knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE laborers in the vineyard are encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged to continue warning and teaching ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery man in all wiſdom, and are cautioned againſt deſpairing of ſucceſs. <hi>The kingdom of God is as if a man ſhould caſt ſeed into the ground, and ſhould ſleep and riſe night and day,
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:036872_0105_100B27C29FA31730"/>and the ſeed ſhould ſpring and grow up he knoweth not how.</hi> The word may take root, by the influences of the Holy Spirit, in a time unthought of by the preacher, and unpromiſing as appearances had been, he may reap the fruit of his labors with joy. Let this be remembered by all the faithful, eſpecially in times of coldneſs and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy. In the morning let them ſow their feed, and in the evening withhold not their hand. While they are ſpeaking to the ear, God may ſpeak to the heart.</p>
               <p>CHRIST directed his diſciples when he ſent them out to preach the goſpel, that if the members of any family, or the inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants of any city or town, would not receive them, or hear their words, to depart from thoſe hardened ſinners, and to ſhake off the duſt of their feet as a teſtimony againſt them. Inſtances may now occur in which the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters of the goſpel are required to depart from particular places, on account of the treatment they receive from the people. There may be particular families or perſons near them to whom they can have no acceſs; and any attempt to counſel or warn them would be like caſting pearls before ſwine. But let none of the ſervants of the Moſt High be haſty in concluding that the door
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:036872_0106_100B27CF2E57A1D8"/>of their uſefulneſs is cloſed. Let them make ſufficient trial to juſtify themſelves in the ſight of God, before they ceaſe laboring with thoſe who ſpurn at the meſſages of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace. We cannot, my brethren, if our hearts be warmed with Chriſtian benev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, ceaſe to pray for ſinners, though we may feel the effects of their enmity, and their ears may be ſhut againſt us. God may hereafter ſend his ſpirit into their hearts, and give them repentance to the acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edging of the truth. The time may come when they will eſteem the followers of the Saviour as the excellent of the earth, and chooſe them for their companions. Such a change has been ſeen in every age, to the joy of the people of God. His arm is not ſhortened that it cannot ſave, neither is his ear heavy that it cannot hear.</p>
               <p n="4">4. WE may learn from the preſent ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject why the Lord's people have been ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant in praying for the effuſions of the Holy Spirit, both on themſelves, and on others.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>The ſpirit helpeth their infirmities: for they know not what to pray for as they ought; but the ſpirit itſelf maketh interceſſion for them with groanings which cannot be uttered.</hi>
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">Rom. viii. 26.</note> By the influences of the Holy Spirit on the hearts of believers they are led to ſuitable petitions and affections in their prayers; and they ſometimes feel that holy fervor which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be expreſſed in words, but muſt reſt in ardent breathings of the ſoul. Theſe ardent breathings cannot be uttered, either by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulate ſounds, or by groanings which ſtrike the ear. If any ſuppoſe that by being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard in the devotions of the cloſet, or that by a loud groan in ſocial prayer, they prove themſelves to be the ſubjects of the ardent breathings of which the apoſtle ſpeaketh, they are greatly miſtaken: For if the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the devout heart can be fully expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by a loud groan, they ceaſe to be unut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable, as truly as if they could be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by an articulate voice.</p>
               <p>FROM the influences of the Holy Ghoſt in forming, ſupporting, and improving the new man, we can eaſily ſee why the ſaints have been ſo abundant in praying that this divine ſanctifier may dwell in them. David
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:036872_0108_100B27D2DBB19D68"/>prayed unto God, in Pſalm li. 11. <hi>Caſt me not away from thy preſence; and take not thy holy ſpirit from me.</hi> Chriſt ſaith to his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, in Luke xi. 13. <hi>If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children; how much more ſhall your heavenly father give the holy ſpirit to them that aſk him.</hi> All the prayers which we find in the ſcriptures of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to God by his children, that <hi>he would lead them in the way of truth—that he would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen their eyes to behold wondrous things out of his law—that he would help their unbelief—that he would increaſe their faith—that he would teach them to pray—that he would evermore give them the bread of life,</hi> and ſimilar favors— all theſe petitions involve the deſires of the heart addreffed to the Father of lights, for the ſanctifying, enlighteaning, and quickening influences of the Holy Spirit. Were theſe wholly withdrawn from Chriſtians, they would relapſe into their former ſpiritual death, and would periſh. Did not the prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſes of God ſecure the final perſeverance of the ſaints in faith and holineſs, they muſt ſit down in deſpair of heaven. They are <hi>choſen to ſalvation through ſanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth.</hi> Of them Chriſt ſaith, in John x. 27, 28. <hi>My ſheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me: And I give unto them eternal life; and

               </p>
               <p>THE children of God tremble at the thought of the Spirit's withdrawment, and mourn that they grieve him by their ſins. They pray above all things for his continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. How often doth the ſaint go to God in earneſt ſupplication, <q>O Lord leave me not to myſelf! Hold thou me up, and I ſhall be ſafe!—Uphold me with thy free Spirit!—Bow my rebellious will, and bring it into perfect ſubjection to thine! Humble me for my pride, my unbelief, my worldlineſs, and all my innumerable ſins!—Make me to know the plague of my own heart, and to feel my depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on thy grace! Warm this cold heart, by ſhedding abroad thy love in it by thy Spirit! Guide me in the way of righteouſneſs! Lead me not into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!

               </p>
               <p>THE truly devout pray for others as well as for themſelves: They pray for all men according to the divine command. The cauſe of Zion lies near their hearts at all
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:036872_0110_100B27D68999DED8"/>times, and eſpecially when they approach the throne of grace. When Daniel under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by attending to the prophetic books that the ſeventy years of the Jewiſh captiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity in Babylon were nearly ended, he <hi>ſet his face unto the Lord God, to ſeek by prayer and ſupplications, with faſting, and ſackcloth and aſhes.</hi> After acknowledging the juſtice and truth of God in bringing all the calamities on the Jews which they had endured, he was importunate in praying for the reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jeruſalem. <hi>O Lord, according to all thy righteouſneſs, I beſeech thee, let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, thy holy mountain: becauſe for our ſins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us. Now, therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy ſervant, and his ſupplications, and cauſe thy face to ſhine upon thy ſanctuary that is deſolate, for the Lord's ſake. O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our deſolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not preſent our ſupplications before thee for our righteouſneſſes, but for thy great mercies. O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken, and do; defer not, for thine own ſake, O my God; for thy city and thy people are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by thy name.</hi>

They believe that the church cannot be kept alive in the world, if it be not ſupported by the ſanctifying influences of the Holy Ghoſt; and that by theſe ſhe will triumph over all oppoſition. Zechari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah iv, 6, 7. <hi>This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, ſaying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my ſpirit, ſaith the Lord of hoſts.

               <p>HAVING in the foregoing diſcourſes conſidered the nature, neceſſity, and Author of the new birth, I proceed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the fruits or effects of this change. Let us, my brethren, deal impartially with ourſelves while we are attending to the character of the regenerate. May God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten our minds by his ſpirit, that we
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:036872_0114_100B27DFDCC33C48"/>may plainly diſtinguiſh true religion from falſe.</p>
               <p>IT is declared by the inſpired writer in the text, that <hi>every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.</hi> This love is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in the context, as entering into the nature of the confeſſion—<hi>That Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh;</hi> which confeſſion diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed <hi>the ſpirit of truth from the ſpirit of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</hi> That faith in the Son of God which is juſtifying <hi>worketh by love.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Gal. v. 6.</note> Every one who is renewed in the ſpirit of his mind, or knoweth God, is a ſubject of this love.</p>
               <p>THE ultimate object of our love is always pleaſing to us; and whatever this be, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines our character. If our hearts be placed on earthly poſſeſſions, we are gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erned by the love of the world. If we <hi>love the praiſe of men more than the praiſe of God,</hi> ambition is the idol which we adore. If ſenſual indulgencies be our chief pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, we are lovers of ſinful pleaſure. If our higheſt affections be placed on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite mind, we are governed by the love of God. <hi>Know ye not,</hi> ſaith the apoſtle, <hi>that to whom ye yield yourſelves ſervants to obey, his
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:036872_0115_100B27E20B6BEB70"/>ſervants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of ſin unto death, or of obedience unto righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. vi. 16.</note> We hear the ſame language from the lips of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>No man can ſerve to maſters; for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or elſe he will hold to the one, and deſpiſe the other. Ye cannot ſerve God and mammon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LET us, my brethren, make the inquiry in the preſence of a holy God, whether we are devoted to him, and are become the ſervants of righteouſneſs? Let us take heed how we hear while we are looking into the nature of that love which forms the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter of thoſe who are born again. If there be any preſent who have no deſire to ſearch and try their ways, let them know that their ſtate is moſt alarming.</p>
               <p>EVERY one who has much acquaintance with the ſcriptures, muſt have obſerved that in them great ſtreſs is laid upon holy love, as being the foundation of true piety. <hi>Love in the fulfilling of the law.</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. xiii. 10.</note> When one of the Jewiſh doctors aſked Chriſt, "Which is the great commandment in the law?" the divine teacher replied, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:036872_0116_100B27E4377F7560"/>thy ſoul, and with all thy mind. This is the firſt and great commandment. And the ſecond is like unto it, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbor as thyſelf. On theſe two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Matth. xxii. 36—40.</note> This law Chriſt perfectly obeyed while he was on the earth, and to redeem ſinners from its curſe he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the croſs. The love enjoined by this law conſtituted the moral image of God on the heart of man when he was created. The ſame moral image is reſtored in regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration. Though the law has ceaſed as a covenant, it remains as a rule of life. It will forever continue as the ſtandard of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. To this man's heart muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, or he muſt periſh. The goſpel breathes the ſame ſpirit with the law. We cannot embrace the goſpel in a ſaving man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, if we do not love God with all our hearts and our neighbor as ourſelves. It is by this love only that our hearts can become united with the kingdom and glory of God, and with the real good of our fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Charity, or love, is the bond of perfectneſs. This makes intelligent beings one in intereſt and enjoyment under all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and forever. This moral union is involved in the prayer which Chriſt offered up a little before his death, for all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:036872_0117_100B27E6693F72C0"/>of his myſtical body, in every age. John xvii. 20, 21, 22. <hi>Neither pray I for theſe alone, but for them alſo which ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on me through their word that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us; that the world may believe that thou haſt ſent me.

               </p>
               <p>FROM the agreement of the ſpirit of the law and the goſpel, it appears that no one can be a friend of the latter who is an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the former. If the law be not holy, juſt and good, there can be no grace in the goſpel. There can be no grace or mercy, in ſaving any one from the puniſhment which is threatened by an unjuſt law: He can claim deliverance on the footing of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</p>
               <p>THE moral law is an object which is pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to every pious mind. The apoſtle Paul <hi>delighted in is after the inward man.</hi>

               <p n="1">1ſt. To ſome of the exerciſes of Chriſtian love towards God. The regenerate are conformed to him in heart; they are united with him in love; verſe 16th of the context—<hi>God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>GOD neceſſarily delighteth in the higheſt good, or the greateſt degree of happineſs, that can exiſt, and chooſeth a plan for its attainment. He cannot fail of accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his deſign; ſince in him are united in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite knowledge, power, and wiſdom, with infinite love. God declareth his glory in the works of his hand; and in theſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth, as they make known to intelligent creatures the fountain of goodneſs which exiſteth from eternity in him. <hi>The glory of the Lord ſhall endure forever; the Lord ſhall rejoice in his works.</hi>

When they love God they become members of his holy intelligent kingdom, and give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to Him who is over all, and is the ſum of being and happineſs.

               <p>THE ſaint rejoiceth that Jehovah is on the throne of the univerſe. The language of his heart is, <hi>Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above all the earth.</hi>

               <p>THEY who have the love of God ſhed abroad in their hearts delight in his mercy as he cauſed it to be proclaimed before Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Exodus xxxiii. 19. <hi>And he ſaid, I will make all my goodneſs paſs before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will ſhew mercy on whom I will ſhew mercy.</hi> Chriſt's followers join with him in the adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and earth, becauſe thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them unto babes.

We know from the character of Jehovah that he will, in the kingdom of his grace, as well as in the kingdom of his providence, do that which infinite love, or a ſupreme regard to the happineſs of his holy kingdom, requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.

               <p>THE particular reaſons of the difference which God maketh between the character and ſtate of the ſaved and the loſt, are not revealed to us; but if we love him we ſhall believe that his conduct in the caſe before us, is dictated by that benevolence which ſeeketh the greateſt ſum of intelligent hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. To accompliſh this deſign is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of infinite wiſdom and love. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſovereignty is an odious doctrine to an unſanctified heart; but when it is clearly placed before the minds of the friends of God, they will rejoice in it.

When Chriſt's death was near at hand, <hi>he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and ſaid, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son alſo may glorify thee.

They give glory to the Son of God for becoming incarnate, and appearing in this world, <hi>to condemn ſin in the fleſh; that the righteouſneſs of the law might be fulfilled in them who walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi> They admire the diſintereſted benevolence of the Redeemer, in that though he was rich, yet for the ſake of his people he became poor, that they through his poverty might be rich. To ſave them he became <hi>a man of ſorrows, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with grief.

               <p>No favors deſerve to be compared with ſpiritual and everlaſting bleſſings. Theſe laſt are of as much higher worth than worldly enjoyments, as the ſoul is ſuperior to the body, and as eternity exceeds time. If we have evidence that we have obtained mercy, we ſhall <hi>give thanks unto the Father, who hath made us meet to be partakers of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the ſaints in light; who hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered us from the power of darkneſs, and hath tranſlated us into the kingdom of his dear Son; in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveneſs of ſins.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Coloſ. i. 12, 13, 14.</note> If our many ſins are forgiven we ſhall love Chriſt with ardent affection; like the woman who waſhed his feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head. The knowledge of our hearts will lead us to ſee our ſins in a much clearer light than we can ſee the ſins of any other perſon; and hence our forgiveneſs will appear to be a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſplay of divine mercy.</p>
               <p>THE love which they who are in Chriſt feel towards him, is of a wholly different nature from that of the hypocrite, whoſe
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:036872_0126_100B27FA35DFA040"/>affection ariſes from no higher motive than his ſuppoſed eſcape from hell, and ſecurity of happineſs. The love of the Chriſtian is of the ſame nature with the benevolence of the divine mind which gave birth to the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel plan of ſalvation. A church hath been raiſed up from among men, <hi>that the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant grace might, through the thankſgiving of many, redound to the glory of God.</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor. iv. 15.</note> The glory of God in the ſalvation of ſinners, is the ſupreme object of the love, the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, the joy, and all the holy exerciſes of the regenerate. If their hearts were not placed on this object, they could not have <hi>fellowſhip with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> They rejoice in the wiſdom, power, and grace of God; which can cauſe enemies to become obedient to his will, and can make ſuch vile worms of the duſt as they are partakers of the happineſs of his holy kingdom, in a way that ſhall <hi>be to the praiſe of his glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE love which is the fruit of the ſpirit lies at the foundation of evangelical repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, of truſt in God, of ſubmiſſion to his will, and of all the graces and virtues which form the Chriſtian character. It will out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live hope, and that faith which is the evidence
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:036872_0127_100B27FC5D6B72C8"/>of things not ſeen: it will riſe to perfection at the cloſe of the preſent life, and will nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er fail. It appears in its full luſtre in the heavenly world, and will reign in the hearts of the redeemed forever.</p>
               <p>BEFORE I leave this part of the ſubject, I would take occaſion to obſerve, that we cannot determine what particular holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes will be firſt perceived by thoſe who are born of God. A great variety is found in their experiences in this reſpect. Some firſt perceive a new beauty in the works of nature around them; and their minds are filled with a pleaſing ſolemn ſenſe of the preſence and glory of God. Others are delighted in contemplating ſome one of the attributes of the Deity. Sometimes the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the regenerate is firſt fixed on the perſon, or offices of Jeſus Chriſt. Not a few have found their cavillings ſtilled for the firſt time by a view of the rectitude and goodneſs of the divine government. Their hearts are charmed with the object before them, and they are aſtoniſhed at their paſt obſtinacy and blindneſs. Moſt commonly the firſt exerciſes of the new man are in view of ſome doctrine, or part of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine conduct, with which the heart had
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:036872_0128_100B27FE8D3EF208"/>been moſt immediately contending. Some firſt taſte that the Lord is gracious in the channel of ſome paſſage of ſcripture brought to their minds; and others have no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar part of the written word in their thoughts, at that time. It often happens that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable length of time paſſes after the dawning of divine light on the ſouls of the regenerate, before they think any thing about their own converſion. The beauty and the glory which captivate their hearts take off their attention from themſelves. They are heard to ſay afterwards to their Chriſtian friends, with reference to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py time when divine truth firſt appeared in a new light, <q>We did not inquire whether we ſhould be ſaved or loſt; but we were ſwallowed up in contemplating the glory of God. We felt willing to be in his hand. We rejoiced in his government, and that his holy name will be magnified for ever.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THE few inſtances which have been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, may ſerve as a ſpecimen of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which might be adduced to illuſtrate the variety obſervable in the earlieſt diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries made to the regenerate. Let the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate object of their firſt and ſubſequent exerciſes be what it may, the temper of
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:036872_0129_100B2800E409CCB0"/>heart implied in them is the ſame in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. There is no other difference between the exerciſes of the renewed heart than is occaſioned by different objects. The heart that is delighted in contemplating one part of the moral works of God, will be delighted in contemplating any other part as it cometh into view. If we love one attribute of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah, we love his whole character. If for inſtance, we love his mercy, we love his juſtice and his truth, and every other moral attribute. If we love his character we ſhall feel glad that he is poſſeſſed of infinite knowledge and power, and that he cannot fail of accompliſhing whatever he pleaſeth: Hence, we ſhall find holy enjoyment in view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the natural perfections of the Moſt High. If we cordially embrace Jeſus Chriſt, we ſhall delight in the law which he honored by his obedience and death. If we be friends to the divine government in any particular branch of it, we are friends to its whole plan. As our minds are limited, we muſt attend to one thing at a time; but as there is perfect unity of character and deſign in God, we ſhall, if renewed in the ſpirit of our minds, be ſatisfied with any and every part of either, when it is ſet before us. All God's children have been made to drink in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one ſpirit; whatever variety exiſts in the
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:036872_0130_100B2803B908D480"/>order of their exerciſes. They are all root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and grounded in love; and they have <hi>one God and Father, who is above all, and through all, and in them all.</hi>—I proceed to conſider,</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. THE exerciſes of Chriſtian love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards mankind. John exhorteth in the beginning of the verſe which contains the text, <hi>Beloved, let us love one another.</hi> The ſame exhortation is ſound in many other places in this epiſtle. Though he may have more immediately in view, in the words juſt quoted, the love which Chriſtians ought to exerciſe towards each other, the love of benevolence towards all mankind is not excluded. Brotherly love cannot exiſt without this, and is built upon it. We are commanded <hi>to love our neighbor as ourſelves.</hi> To enjoin and enforce this love, is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the ſix laſt commandments in the decalogue.</p>
               <p>IF we love God we ſhall conſider the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of our neighbor as being of as much importance as our own. We cannot have the ſame conſciouſneſs of his joys and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, as we can of our own; neither is his welfare entruſted to us in the ſame ſenſe in which our own is: But as the portion of rational exiſtence which he poſſeſſes bears
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:036872_0131_100B2805424EC260"/>the ſame relation to the infinite mind that ours doth, he is equally with us capable of happineſs or miſery, and it is as much to be deſired that <hi>he</hi> ſhould be ſaved, as that <hi>we</hi> ſhould be ſaved.</p>
               <p>We are ſtrangers to Chriſtian love, if we harbor malice or revenge in our hearts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards any of our fellow-creatures, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be the treatment we receive at their hands. Chriſt commandeth us <hi>to love our enemies, to bleſs them that curſe us, to do good to them that hate us, and to pray for them that deſpitefully uſe us, and perſecute us.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Matth. v. 44.</note> It is our duty to frown on the workers of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity, and caſes may occur in which love to the public good requires that we make exertions to bring them to ſuffer for their crimes, even unto death; but we are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to indulge malice towards them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any circumſtances whatever.</p>
               <p>JESUS CHRIST was an open and a bold reprover of wickedneſs in all ranks of men, from the loweſt up to the higheſt. He was at the ſame time benevolent towards them all, he was grieved for the hardneſs of their hearts, and earneſtly beſought them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and to ſecure everlaſting happineſs. His heart was tenderly touched when he
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:036872_0132_100B28080E0F9430"/>looked forward to the miſeries which were about to fall upon the Jews, for their killing the prophets, and ſtoning the meſſengers of the Lord of hoſts who had been ſent unto them. When he was riding in triumph to Jeruſalem a few days before his death, as he drew near the city, <hi>he wept over it, ſaying, If thou hadſt known, even thou at leaſt in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hidden from thine eyes.</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Luke xix. 41, 42.</note> When he was dying on the croſs, he prayed for his murderers, <hi>Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE benevolent ſpirit of the goſpel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences all Chriſt's real diſciples to imitate, in ſome degree, his meekneſs and love; <hi>who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he ſuffered, he threatened not; but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Pet. ii. 23.</note> Chriſt ſaith, in Matthew. vi. 15, <hi>But if ye forgive not men their treſpaſſes, neither will your Father forgive your treſpaſſes.</hi> He inculcates the ſame doctrine in many other places. We cannot pray for ourſelves in a manner that will be accepted of a holy God, if we cannot at the ſame time forgive our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and aſk mercy for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="unknown:036872_0133_100B280A34309C68"/>
THE children of God look with ſorrow and pity upon a wicked and a ſecure world; and ſometimes almoſt forget themſelves in their concern for others. They pour out their hearts to God for them in worſhipping aſſemblies, and in their cloſets, and when the preſence of ſcoffers requires them to be ſilent their ſupplications are aſcending. They rejoice when ſinners are converted from the error of their way, and glorify God that he hath granted unto them repentance unto life.</p>
               <p>IF Chriſtians did not love the felicity and glory of God's kingdom above the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of individuals, they would be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolable in reflecting on the miſery of any part of the intelligent creation. But as they believe that God will be glorified, they reſt ſatisfied with his conduct in permitting all the evil which now exiſts, or which will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt to eternity. As they feel that ſin in them juſtly deſerves puniſhment, they know that ſin in others juſtly deſerves puniſhment: and as they are fully convinced that there is no malice or cruelty in Him who is love, they cannot doubt but that he acteth in char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter when he dooms the wicked to endleſs puniſhment. There can be no error in the counſel of infinite knowledge, wiſdom, and benevolence. That plan muſt have been

               <p>LOVE is delighted in finding kindred ſouls. A true patriot feels a peculiar attachment to thoſe who make the welfare of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth their purſuit, and who unite with him in deteſting the politics and the meaſures which tend to diſorganize ſociety. The regenerate feel a peculiar friendſhip to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe who manifeſt that their hearts
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:036872_0135_100B280E85FD2848"/>are placed on the kingdom of the Redeemer. The apoſtle Paul, in his firſt epiſtle to the church of the Theſſalonians, addreſſeth the brethren, in chap. iv. 9, in the following words, <hi>But as touching brotherly love, ye need not that I write unto you; for ye yourſelves are taught of God to love one another.</hi> John ſaith, <hi>We know that we have paſſed from death unto life, becauſe we love the brethren.</hi>

               <p>OUR zeal on this ſubject will not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to knowledge if we ſuppoſe it to be impoſſible to love one as a brother in Chriſt, if the perſon ſo loved be not a true believer, We cannot indeed regard one as a follower of the Son of God, if he do not appear, in a judgment of charity, to have his Spirit; but as we cannot certainly know the heart of another we are liable to be deceived in our opinion of him. If we feel a compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency in any one on account of his appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent friendſhip to Chriſt, this is a good ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:036872_0136_100B28118FAF3A70"/>that <hi>we</hi> are Chriſtians; but it is no certain evidence that the perſon ſo loved is a real Chriſtian. Many facts might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, were it neceſſary, to prove that the apoſtles, and others in primitive times, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and treated perſons as brethren in the Lord for a ſeaſon, who afterwards made it manifeſt by their ungodly conduct that they were <hi>in the gall of bitterneſs, and in the bond of iniquity.</hi> Not a few, in every age, have demonſtrated by their conduct that their temporary fair appearance of piety did not ſpring from a pure heart. The promiſe of heaven which is made to expreſſions of brotherly love, doth not imply that the perſon who is the object of it is a member of Chriſt's myſtical body. Matth. x. 42. <hi>And whoſoever ſhall give to drink unto one of theſe little ones a cup of cold water only, in the name of a diſciple, verily I ſay unto you, He ſhall in no wiſe loſe his reward.</hi> We may obſerve that it is not affirmed that the one to whom the cup of cold water is given ſhall have eternal life, as all true believers will; but the promiſe is made <hi>to him that giveth a cup of cold water, in the name of a diſciple.</hi> It is promiſed that <hi>he, the donor, ſhall in no wiſe loſe his reward.</hi> He will be owned, in this very act, by Chriſt in the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:036872_0137_100B2813D26AD030"/>if the perſon to whom he miniſtered ſhould prove to be a hypocrite.</p>
               <p>IN avoiding the error into whith ſome have run in holding to the certain knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of Chriſtians, let us not go into the oppoſite extreme of allowing no other teſt of brotherly love than will perfectly ſuit the taſte of the mere formaliſt. The regenerate honor them that fear the Lord, chooſe them for their companions, and prize their ſociety far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that of the great and the honorable of the earth who deny the power of godlineſs. They who are born of God bear the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of their brethren, and rejoice in their growth in grace. They ſeek to unboſom themſelves to Chriſtians of higher attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in knowledge and holineſs, and are edified in liſtening to their counſels and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions. It is an animating thought to the children of God, that they will ſoon meet in their heavenly Father's houſe above, freed from their preſent imperfections, and perfectly united in love.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly. THE love which is the fruit of the Holy Spirit, influences to a life of obedience to God's commandments.</p>
               <p>LOVE in the heart is an active principle; and is the ſum of all that God requireth of
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:036872_0138_100B28155AB17348"/>man. This leads to a courſe of behavior which is conformable to the laws and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the ſupreme King. Holy obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is not founded on mercenary motives, or ſlaviſh fear, but ſprings from a deſire to promote the declarative glory of God.</p>
               <p>GREAT ſtreſs is laid on Chriſtian practice in the ſcriptures: John xiv. 23. <hi>Jeſus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, and ſaid unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words; and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</hi> No profeſſion of love is of any worth which is not accompanied with obedience to the divine will. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes in vain to know God, who does not obey his laws. <hi>He that ſaith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">1 John ii. 4.</note> We place no depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on the higheſt profeſſions of friendſhip, when they are not accompanied with a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding behaviour. Let a man declare to us with never ſo much warmth of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that he is attached to our perſon and intereſt, we give no credit to his words, if he conſtantly employs every art, and adopts every method, in his power, to viliſy our reputation, and to rob us of all that we hold dear in life. Nor can we look upon one in
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:036872_0139_100B281872A42C20"/>any other light than that of an enemy, who can hear us traduced, or ſee an injury done us, without manifeſting any regret. The abſurdity would be not leſs glaring to conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er perſons as the friends and ſervants of the Moſt High, who, whatever profeſſions of love they may make, join in their practice with his open enemies, in diſhonoring his name, and deſpiſing his kingdom. Though creatures can neither defeat, nor diſappoint, the ſupreme Ruler, their rebellion carries no leſs guilt in it, than if it could accompliſh its wiſhes. We may add, that the infinite ſuperiority of the Creator to his creatures, in connexion with his holy character, raiſes the guilt of ſin to a height which exceeds all human calculation.</p>
               <p>HOLY obedience hath reſpect to all God's commandments. If we love him we ſhall feel a reverence for his name, when we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it with our lips; not indulging our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in appealing to him to give energy to trifling diſcourſe, nor in imprecating his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on ourſelves, or on others. God's people, in all ages, have <hi>called the ſabbath a delight,</hi> and have honored him on that day, by attending on the public ordinances of his appointment. It has been painful to them
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:036872_0140_100B281BF89C2830"/>to be detained from his houſe, and the means of inſtruction, or quickening, which he hath inſtituted. Prayer is the breath of thoſe who are born again. They attend to this in their houſes and in the ſanctuary. They maintain ſecret prayer. Love reigning in the heart inclines to the practice of the various relative and ſocial duties. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be under the government of this holy principle, and diſregard juſtice, mercy, truth, and the other virtues which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in the love of our neighbor. The knavery, the unmerciful temper, the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting, the falſhood, the covetouſneſs, and the envy which have appeared in ſome high profeſſors, have brought great reproach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſtianity, and have given occaſion to its enemies to blaſpheme. If we be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the influence of the pure and benevolent ſpirit of the goſpel we ſhall renounce theſe, and all other vices, and ſhall practiſe the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite virtues. In our treatment of our neighbor we ſhall keep in mind the rule which our Saviour hath given to us, in Matth. vii. 12. <hi>Therefore all things whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them: for this is the law and the prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHERE Chriſtian love reigns, an ardent deſire is felt to diffuſe a ſpirit of peace and
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:036872_0141_100B281D81E2C9C0"/>friendſhip through families, neighborhoods, communities, and the whole world of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. It reſtrains the furious and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant paſſions. It excites to a winning and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging behavior, and that diffuſive good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which ſpreads itſelf on every ſide; reſembling the gentle yet overflowing ſtream, which fertilizes the neighboring fields. It ſuppreſſes unchaſte deſires, and intemperate indulgencies, and regulates the animal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites by the ſtandard of true wiſdom. The goſpel is every way calculated to make men wiſe and happy, and to carry their ſocial nature to its higheſt perfection.</p>
               <p>IF we are the ſubjects of the new birth, we ſhall labor to <hi>cleanſe ourſelves from all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear of God.</hi> We ſhall not take the lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty to paſs by ſome of the commands of God, and ſelect only a few to be carried into our practice; but we ſhall regard the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine authority in all the laws given by the great Head of the church, and diſcover by the manner in which we ſpend life, that none of his injunctions are grievous to us. We ſhall unite with the pious Pſalmiſt, in his addreſs unto Jehovah, <hi>Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou uſeſt to do unto thoſe that love thy name. Order my ſteps in thy

As in the infant there are all the members of the full grown man, ſo in the children of God there are all parts of the Chriſtian character in a ſmall degree; and a foundation is laid by the grace of God for them to come <hi>unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt.</hi> There is no one ſin which the Chriſtian allows himſelf to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, nor one luſt which he ſpares, though he ſinneth daily, and even while he is attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all the forms of duty.

               <p>THERE is ſomething in the ſtate of the Chriſtian while on earth, that is different from what we can find in any other creature in any world. The inhabitants of heaven are perfectly holy; the inhabitants of hell are wholly givenup of God to their ſins, and to endure his wrath; the unregenerate in this world have no holineſs in their hearts: But when we look to the Chriſtian, we find one who has ſomething of holineſs, and the remains of ſin yet continuing in him. The old man is crucified, but the new man has not yet prevailed to his complete removal. Every believer of much age, can ſay with the apoſtle—<hi>That which I do, I allow not, for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.</hi>

But it is the plan of infinite wiſdom to train up men from a ſmall beginning of holineſs, compared to a grain of muſtard ſeed, for the ſtate of perfect purity and joy. Divine grace is wonderfully diſplayed in keeping alive the ſmall degree of holy love implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in regeneration. Who but a God of Almighty power could preſerve this, amidſt ſo much remaining corruption, and cauſe it to grow up to a ſtate of maturity? Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians by comparing ſin and holineſs together in themſelves, ſee their oppoſite natures in a more ſtriking manner; and are more deeply impreſſed with the belief, that their ſalvation from beginning to end, is effected by the free and ſovereign mercy of God. On the riches of divine grace they daily meditate. They have begun to dwell on a theme which will appear more and more marvellous the longer they live.

               <p>THE leading exerciſes of Chriſtian love, and its influence on the temper and conduct of the regenerate, were conſidered in the laſt diſcourſe. In a review of the ſubject we are taught,</p>
               <p n="1">1. THAT the love which has private or perſonal happineſs for its ſupreme object, is eſſentially different from the love which is the fruit of the Holy Spirit.</p>

OUR private happineſs is of as much worth as that of any other creature who is poſſeſſed of the ſame degree of intelligent exiſtence; and ought to be prized and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by us in ſubordination to the glory of God, and the happineſs of his moral king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The only way of ſecuring real hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to ourſelves, is to feel ſatisfied with our proper place in the ſyſtem, and to be governed by that temper which correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponds with our relations to God and to our rellow-creatures. Under the dominion of ſuch exerciſes of heart, we ſhall, according to our finite capacity, enjoy all the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the kingdom of God. Hence ſaith the apoſtle, when writing to his Chriſtian brethren—<hi>All things are yours; whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things preſent, or things to come; all are yours; and ye are Chriſt's; and Chriſt is God's.</hi>

               <p>ALL unſanctified men love themſelves ſupremely; and the whole of their affection towards God is grounded on the belief, or hope, that he will make them happy.

The Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites ſang God's praiſe at the red ſea; but ſoon forgat his works. When Chriſt rode in triumph into Jeruſalem, a vaſt croud of people, <hi>cried, ſaying, Hoſanna to the Son of David; Bleſſed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hoſanna in the higheſt.</hi>

               <p>THE malefactor condemned to death by human laws may, when pardoned, be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with joy, and may feel warm gratitude towards the magiſtrate who reprieved him, without the leaſt abhorrence of the crime which he had committed. He may, as has ſometimes been ſeen, be more given to deed. of violence than ever. The greateſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner may, without a change of heart, be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to a certain kind of gratitude towards God, and that to a high degree, from a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief that God hath ſecured him from the torments of hell, and will make him happy in the eternal world. This preſumptuous hope is often raiſed by taking hold of a text of ſcripture brought to the mind. When Satan perverted a ſcripture promiſe, to
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:036872_0148_100B282DA9056378"/>tempt Chriſt to caſt himſelf down from a pinnacle of the temple, the Son of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted the adverſary. Chriſt's followers, by ſtrength derived from him, have been able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one. But the impenitent may fall in with a perverted ſenſe of ſcripture paſſages, and fatally deceive themſelves. Were a man emboldened to perpetrate ſome daring crime by pleading for his ſupport the words, <hi>Wait on the Lord, be of good courage, and be ſhall ſtrengthen thine heart,</hi> we ſhould pronounce him guilty of horrid preſumption. The hope of that man is as truly unwarranted who concludes himſelf to be delivered from the curſe of the law, while he remains in impenitence, becauſe ſome text of ſcripture comes into his mind and he takes comfort from it; ſuch as <hi>Son, be of good cheer, thy ſins are forgiven thee.</hi> We have no authority to be comforted by any promiſe made to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers unleſs we poſſeſs their character. We muſt be the ſubjects of evangelical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or we can have no juſt evidence that we are forgiven, and are made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. We muſt firſt find love to God in our hearts before we can know, or have the ſmalleſt reaſon to conclude, that we are his children.</p>
               <p>IT may here be inquired in what ſenſe the 19th verſe of the context is to be under|
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:036872_0149_100B2831068046B0"/>ſtood, <hi>We love him, becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi> We may learn the meaning of theſe words by looking back to the 9th and 10th verſes, <hi>In this was manifeſted the love of God toward us, becauſe that God ſent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be the propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for our ſins.</hi> God provided a Saviour through the infinite love of his benevolent mind. If he had not done this, and ſent his Spirit to operate on the hearts of the children of men, none of them would have loved him, and have been ſaved. The love which is in the hearts of the regenerate is the fruit, or the effect, of that love which hath exiſted in the divine mind from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Their hearts are not firſt drawn out in love to God by believing that God loved them in particular. God loveth his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with the love of complacency; becauſe they wear his holy image, and place their hearts on his Son Jeſus Chriſt. John xvi. 27. <hi>For the Father himſelf loveth you, becauſe ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.</hi> It is very obvious that the love of the Father here expreſſed, is differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from the benevolence which he exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth towards mankind at large. When any unregenerate perſons love God from a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief that he loveth them in the ſame ſenſe in
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:036872_0150_100B28334B7380D8"/>which he loveth his own children, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a falſehood. The regenerate feel a love to God for the excellencies of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The divine character is the firſt and the higheſt object of their love. When they contemplate the conduct of the Moſt High in providing a ranſom for them while they were his enemies, they admire his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted love, but they do not believe that he delighted in their character while they were his enemies. If the hearts of any are firſt melted into love from the belief that they ſhall not periſh, their love is ſelfiſhneſs at bottom, and they are far from the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</p>
               <p>SOME have affirmed that ſinners love God when they have a full perſuaſion that he juſtifieth the ungodly through the atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; becauſe this faith relieves their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences from guilt. This ſcheme ſuppoſes that holy love originates in ſelfiſhneſs, and that God juſtifieth an impenitent ſinner. The exerciſes of heart which harmonize with this ſcheme have no holineſs in them, and therefore cannot be approved by infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite purity. It is true that when any one is juſtified on the plan of the goſpel, he is ungodly in the eye of the law, becauſe he falls very far ſhort of its requirements; but it is at the ſame time true that juſtifying faith
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:036872_0151_100B2834D10456A8"/>involves in its nature the ſame kind of love which the law requires. The love of God implanted in the hearts of believers is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preffed in repentance, and in many other ways which had not been poſſible if man had not ſinned; but the nature of holy love is the ſame under the covenant of grace, as under the covenant of works.</p>
               <p>ALL falſe religions, of whatever name, or appearance, are built on a ſelfiſh founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and gratify a proud heart. The worſt of men, who acknowledge the exiſtence of a God, are willing to believe that he is too merciful to puniſh them, and that all his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes are pledged to ſave them from hell. Some flatter themſelves with the hope that if they keep themſelves from external vices, and maintain a decency of behaviour, they ſhall be ſaved. Others expect to find favor in the ſight of God by a momentary relent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near the cloſe of a wicked life, and by repairing to the divine mercy when they can no longer enjoy the pleaſures of ſin. Theſe perſons are actuated by no better mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives than Joab was when he fled unto the tabernacle of the Lord, and caught hold on the horns of the altar, to eſcape that death which he had merited by his crimes. Their preſumptuous hope will be as vain as his was,
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:036872_0152_100B283744BFCA30"/>in the day of the Lord's vengeance. There are others who truſt in high flights of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious affections, ariſing from a confident be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief that they are converted, and ſhall go to heaven, while they diſcover all the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of party zeal, and perhaps are as deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute of external morality as they are of Chriſtian meekneſs. Hypocrites may be willing to deny themſelves in many things, for the ſake of being made happy. They may, like the ancient Phariſees, take upon themſelves much labor, and practiſe great auſterities in their religion, to ſoothe them in their indulgence of a favorite luſt. They may be willing to ſuffer for a while, from a belief that they ſhall receive compenſation hereafter; like as the miſer may chooſe to dreſs in mean apparel, and to feed on coarſe food, for the ſake of increaſing his riches.— Time would fail even to hint at the various courſes that run into the broad road which leadeth to deſtruction.</p>
               <p>THE Chriſtian giveth up himſelf to God without reſerve. He denieth himſelf; and <hi>counteth all things but loſs for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus his Lord.</hi> He feels that the ſufferings which he is called to endure, are far leſs than his ſins deſerve; and believes that his calamities are neceſſary in the counſels of the Moſt High, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:036872_0153_100B283974965F30"/>the glory of his great name, and the happineſs of his kingdom. The Chriſtian rejoiceth in the government of Jehovah; and is comforted by the divine declarations which promiſe that the light and momentary afflictions of time, will work for the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi> He doth not, like the hypocrite, think highly of his ſervices, or his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; but views himſelf as an unprofitable ſervant, and laments that he exerciſeth ſo little patience under his trials. The hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite places all his religious enjoyment in what he ſuppoſes <hi>he</hi> has done, or endured, and in what has been done for <hi>him.</hi> The enjoyment of the Chriſtian ariſes from what he diſcovers in <hi>God,</hi> and in his holy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. His love and his joy terminate on an object as much above himſelf as God is greater than man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. WE may learn from the preſent ſubject why Chriſtans have ſuch a deep ſenſe of the evil of ſin.</p>
               <p>THEY have come to the light, and by this they behold the deformity of ſin. The hearer they approach to God the more they ſee their own vileneſs, and the ſtronger is their deſire to lie low before him. When Iſaiah, in viſion, ſaw the Lord ſitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and when he
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:036872_0154_100B283D6ADE1B18"/>heard the ſeraphims crying one to another, ſaying, <hi>Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hoſts; the whole earth is full of his glory,</hi> the prophet ſaid, <hi>Woe is me! for I am undone; becauſe I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midſt of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have ſeen the King, the Lord of Hoſts.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſaiah vi. 5.</note> We find abundantly in the ſcriptures that when God hath made a clear diſcovery of himſelf to his children, they have had a very lively ſenſe of the evil of ſin, and have been fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with ſelf-loathing. Their hearts are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med on a different ſcale from that of the men of the world. They are prepared to view ſin in as new a light as holineſs. They hate ſin chiefly becauſe it is committed againſt a holy God, and is directly oppoſed to the benevolent deſigns of his kingdom. They feel that ſin tends to baniſh all order, peace and happineſs from the univerſe; and that they can never ſufficiently abhor themſelves for doing the abominable thing which the Lord hateth.</p>
               <p>WHEN any become renewed in the ſpirit of their mind, they begin to have godly ſorrow. They look back on the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of paſt life, and pray, with the Pſalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt, long after he had devoted himſelf to the ſervice of Jehovah, <hi>Remember not the ſins of

               <p>IF the religion of the goſpel were of a ſelfiſh nature, the ſubject of it would ceaſe to mourn for his paſt ſins, as ſoon as he ſuppoſed himſelf to be pardoned: But ſince it breatheth a diſintereſted ſpirit, the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent will increaſe in godly ſorrow, as he makes progreſs in holineſs. They who are juſtified before God on the ground of the atonement, mourn for ſin as it expoſes to the divine wrath; but as their hatred of ſin ariſes from viewing it on a higher ſcale than their private happineſs, or miſery, their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:036872_0156_100B28413655CE28"/>of it muſt increaſe as they grow in the knowledge of God. If this be not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it will follow that the deſign of Chriſt in coming into the world to ſave ſinners, was to render them leſs deſerving of pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment: which would make him a miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſin. Are there any of the followers of the Son of God in the hearing of this diſcourſe, let me aſk you whether the ſins of your paſt lives are not daily before you? Have you not an increaſing ſenſe of their aggravations? Do not your views of a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Saviour heighten your ideas of the divine juſtice in your endleſs puniſhment, as much as of the divine mercy in your ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Do you not feel yourſelves preſſed in ſpirit to confeſs your ſins to God, and to aſk forgiveneſs?</p>
               <p>THE children of God not only renew their repentance of their ſins while they were his enemies, but they are deeply hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for their backſlidings. In how many ways do they diſhonor God? If the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which they commit were marked againſt them, they would have the moſt dreadful puniſhment of any of the human race. They ſin againſt clearer light than others, and againſt ſuch manifeſtations of the divine love as were never known by the wicked. The ſaints have ſometimes fallen into ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:036872_0157_100B28430BF23A40"/>ſins, whereby they have brought great reproach on the religion which they profeſs, in the eyes of a ſcoſſing world. When they have been brought to a proper ſenſe of what they have done, they have prayed with David, in Pſalm li. after his ſin in the matter of Uriah, <hi>Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy loving-kindneſs; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my tranſgreſſions. Waſh me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanſe me from my ſin. For I acknouledge my tranſgreſſions; and my ſin is ever before me. Againſt thee, thee only have I ſinned, and done this evil in thy ſight; that thou mighteſt be juſtified when thou ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and be clear when thou judgeſt.</hi> The ſame ſpirit runs through this Pſalm. None can read it with an unaffected heart, when they feel lively ſorrow on account of their backſlidings. When Chriſt turned and looked upon Peter after he had thrice denied him, the heart of that diſciple was deeply wounded, as he recalled the warnings which he had received a few hours before from his Lord, and as he reflected how awfully he had fallen; he would no longer continue in his wickedneſs, but <hi>went out, and wept bitterly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE preſent ſorrow of God's people is neceſſary, to imbitter ſin to them, to increaſe
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:036872_0158_100B2845F1168B28"/>their watchfulneſs, to teach them their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on ſovereign mercy, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them for the world of perfect holineſs and joy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. THE ſubject to which we have been attending, points out the way in which the children of God are to get evidence, that they belong to his family.</p>
               <p>WOULD you, brethren, be ſatisfied that you are new creatures, be under the lively influence of Chriſtian love. Remember the words recorded in 1 John iii. 18—21. <hi>My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed, and in truth. And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and ſhall aſſure our hearts before him. For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence toward God.</hi> Attend to the rules of trial laid down in the 13th and 18th verſes of the context, <hi>Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, becauſe he hath given us of his Spirit. There is no fear in love; but perfect love caſteth out fear: becauſe fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.</hi> By the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in the hearts of the regenerate, they become the ſubjects of a filial fear of God. The fear which is caſt out is that
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:036872_0159_100B2847744E6180"/>ſlaviſh fear which operates on the minds of the wicked, when their conſciences are awake, and they tremble, and ſeek to hide themſelves from the preſence of the Lord; as did our firſt parents, on the day of their apoſtacy, when they heard his voice in the garden. If you find the preſent influence of a childlike fear of God on your hearts, you have preſent evidence that you are born again. No one is cheered by Chriſtian hope while in a ſlothful frame. Divine conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is found only in a ſeaſon of diligence in performing the duties of the heavenly calling. <hi>Brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election ſure. Add to your faith, virtue; and to virtue, knowledge; and to knowledge, temperance; and to temperance, patience; and to patience, godlineſs; and to godlineſs, brotherly kindneſs; and to brotherly kindneſs, charity. For if theſe things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye ſhall neither be barren, nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Peter i.</note>
               </p>
               <p>THE ſelf-examination enjoined in the ſcriptures, implies a preſent approach unto God, while the heart is compared with his word. If you find that you love his char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter as there drawn, you will have a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:036872_0160_100B2848F90E6A30"/>in yourſelves that you believe on his Son. None but hypocrites can feel ſatisfied with paſt attainments. They may be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that their ſtate is good, even while they confeſs that their hearts are cold in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Chriſtians cannot feel any aſſurance of hope, while they continue in a careleſs frame. In this ſtate they will derive no comfort, by adverting to any teſt of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſincerity which is to be found in the Bible.</p>
               <p>GOD'S children will be recovered from their lapſes, becauſe he hath promiſed to keep them by his power, through faith, unto ſalvation; but they will enjoy no peace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they retread the ſteps by which they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered from truth, or duty. When they turn to folly, the Lord will <hi>viſit their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions with the rod, and their iniquity with ſtripes;</hi> but when they return by repentance from their backſlidings, he will <hi>make them to hear joy and gladneſs; that the bones which he hath broken may rejoice.</hi> The Lord's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in returning unto him will find their hope to brighten: and in ſuch revivals they can look back with pleaſure on the paſt days in which they enjoyed the light of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; and their hope will be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by the retroſpect.</p>
               <p>CHRISTIANS, you are not to make com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:036872_0161_100B284B441A00C8"/>but conformity to God, the firſt and higheſt object of your purſuit. <hi>Now</hi> bow yourſelves before God—<hi>now</hi> humbly and penitently ſeek his favor—and <hi>now</hi> delight in the honor of his name, and in the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his kingdom, and you will find that peace in your ſouls which is evidential of your adoption. When you draw the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to God you will think the leaſt of your perſonal happineſs; yet in theſe ſeaſons there will be the higheſt proof that you are heirs of heaven. In the happy moments when you enjoy ſweet communion with your heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enly Father, you will find that you can ſay with Thomas, <hi>My Lord, and my God!</hi> When you are conſcious of ſuch exerciſes of heart towards him, what other evidence do you need that you belong to his family? Can you wiſh for a ſecret whiſper from above, to tell you that your names are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Lamb's book of life? or that a holy angel ſhould be ſent from before the throne of God, to give you this informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Impulſes and ſuggeſtions are, at beſt, but a part of the wood, hay, and ſtubble, which will be burnt up in the day of the Lord. They are deluſory and dangerous.

Brethren, grow in conformity to God's ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nature and will, and you will have ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory proof that you are his children. Would you know the joy of God's ſalvation, wander not from his commandments. An able writer on Experimental Religion <note n="*" place="bottom">Shepard.</note> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, <q>It is heaven to cleave to him in every command; it is death to depart from any command; <hi>Hereby know we that we are in him.</hi> If it were poſſible to aſk of the angels, how they know they are not devils, they would anſwer, the Lord's will is ours. So here, how do you know you have not the nature of devils, and ſo in the ſtate of devils, bound there 'till the judgment of the great day? Becauſe God hath changed our vile natures, and made our wills like unto his glorious will.</q>

               <p>THE apoſtle ſpeaketh of the <hi>Witneſs of the Spirit,</hi> in Rom. viii. 16. <hi>The ſpirit itſelf bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth witneſs with our ſpirit, that we are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God.</hi> By this cannot be meant, that the Holy Ghoſt maketh an immediate dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laration to the believer's mind that he ſhall be ſaved. The witneſs is <hi>mediate</hi>—it is through the medium of the holy temper implanted, that the teſtimony is given.
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:036872_0163_100B285286193FB0"/>None except believers will be ſaved. The ſpirit of God cannot contradict this. If he did he would ſpeak an oppoſite language to the minds of men, from that which he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the ſcriptures. The heart muſt be renewed, before any can have it witneſſed to their conſciences by the Holy Spirit, that they are the children of God. The witneſs of the ſpirit, in the verſe quoted, is the ſame with that which is mentioned in the two verſes next preceding, <hi>For as many as are led by the ſpirit of God, they are the ſons of God. For ye have not received the ſpirit of bondage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to fear; but ye have received the ſpirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</hi> When Chriſtians are fully convinced that they can, with a filial temper, draw nigh to God, they have evidence that the Holy Ghoſt hath renewed their hearts. Would you know whether you love your earthly friends, you muſt have recourſe to your tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and conduct towards them. Would you know whether you are the friends of God, and conſequently whether you are heirs of glory, look into your hearts and lives, and inquire whether you feel and act like Chriſtians. As far as you find conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity to God, ſo far you have cauſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that you are members of his holy kingdom.—In this place we may ſee why
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:036872_0164_100B2854F8587040"/>Chriſtians have ſo little evidence of their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual calling. They have but a ſmall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of bolineſs, and therefore can expect but a ſmall degree of aſſurance.</p>
               <p>WE read of <hi>the full aſſurance of hope,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. vi. II.</note> and <hi>the full aſſurance of faith.</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. x. 22.</note> We are not to underſtand by either of theſe expreſſions, that there is a promiſe that the hope of any believer will be ſo ſtrong, as in no inſtance to be weakened by doubt. The foundation of Chriſtian faith and hope is immoveable; but the hope of Chriſtians with reſpect to their building on this foundation, may be, and often is, ſhaken. There is nothing ſaid in the ſcriptures which implies that they are ſecured from this. The hope of thoſe Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians has been brighteſt who have been caſt into the furnace of affliction, or who have been called to ſeal their faith with their blood. If you are looking for the aſſurance of faith, and to have it abide in your hearts, you will be diſappointed if it be not your firſt and conſtant labor, to devote yourſelves wholly to God, and if your private happineſs do not appear very ſmall in your eyes, when compared to the glory of his name and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Firmly reſolve in the ſtrength of the Lord, that whether you live, or die, you will live and die unto him. Let your daily
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:036872_0165_100B2856D3D78F30"/>practice correſpond with this dedication, and you will have comfortable evidence, if not the full aſſurance of hope, that you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a crown of life.</p>
               <p>WE may diſcover conſummate wiſdom and goodneſs in the plan of divine grace. The comfort of Chriſtians depends on their living near to God. It appears every way beſt that they ſhould be in trouble after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming lukewarm, or worldly; and that their enjoyment ſhould be no greater than their conformity. They are not prepared for high and uninterrupted conſolation in the preſent world. They will have as clear evidence of their title to the tree of life, as they are fitted to receive; and this evidence will, in moſt inſtances, be proportioned to their ſanctification. There are ſome excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the general rule laſt mentioned. I will notice the principal ones.</p>
               <p>THERE are ſome Chriſtians whoſe aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance falls below their ſanctification, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of wrong doctrinal conceptions. They may ſuppoſe that the full aſſurance of hope is not attainable; or they may blend imaginary notions with their faith; or they may believe that if aſſurance be once obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it muſt be permanent. Such miſtakes as theſe will operate againſt diſcerning the evidence, which they otherwiſe might, in favor of their gracious ſincerity.</p>
               <p>

SOME Chriſtians have leſs aſſurance than others of the ſame degree of holineſs, by reaſon of melancholy, or temptations. Their views are clouded by theſe things, and they are ready to conclude that they have never put on the new man. When pious perſons are inclined, either from a particular mental caſt, or the glooms which ariſe from bodily diſorders, to dwell wholly on the dark ſide of things, they are pecul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iarly expoſed to the fiery darts of Satan; and to be driven to the borders of deſpair. While Chriſtian friends think favorably of their ſtate, the unhappy perſons will admit no conſolation. They are much to be pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ied, and great ſkill is requiſite in the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them. Chriſtian tenderneſs and wiſdom are to be employed, in attempting to prevent the bruiſed reed from being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and the ſmoking flax from being quenched. Thoſe Chriſtians who have been thrown into great darkneſs, have ſometimes emerged from it into very clear light, and have been made highly uſeful in comforting others.</p>
               <p>THOUGH Chriſtians are actuated by a common ſpirit, a great variety is to be ſeen in the outward expreſſions of their love. Hence, each one hath <hi>his</hi> particular croſs to take up, when he commences a follower of
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:036872_0167_100B285C79C6C198"/>the Son of God. Religion will operate on perſons very much according to their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular turn of mind. They will, when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its influence, other things being equal, put on different appearances, as they are conſtitutionally inclined to be cheerful, or gloomy; bold, or timid; confident, or doubtful; warm, or ſedate. It is import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to attend to this variety of tempers, to avoid cenſoriouſneſs, and for the ſake of being prepared both to receive, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter, ſuitable brotherly admonition. While every charitable allowance is to be made on the ground which has been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, it is to be remembered that holy love will incline perſons of whatever mental complexion, to purity of heart and life, and to be friends to the decency and order required by the goſpel. <note n="*" place="bottom">When the paſſions become boiſterous, the mind is in a very unfit ſtate for ſerious reflection. After the ſinner is alarmed, his mind is in the beſt ſtate to attend to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truth when it is ſolemnized by a deep and ſteady conviction of the nature and evil of ſin, and of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of being reconciled to God. If public teachers make it their chief aim to addreſs the paſſions, they are either ignorant of the ſtructure of the human mind, or they are ſtriving to promote ſome intereſt very different from the converſion of ſouls to God. The revival of Religion in many towns in NEW-ENGLAND, in 1798, and 1799, has been uncommonly free from bodily diſtortions and outcries. It is not to be ſuppoſed that all the viſible converts are real ones, but this religious appearance has been very promiſing. They who have profeſſed to be the ſubjects of this work, have, in general, avoided open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their internal exerciſes in promiſcuous collections. The telling of experiences has not been the buſineſs of thoſe religious meetings in which perſons of various char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters are drawn together. Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> ſpeaking of perſons publiſhing their own experiences, without regard to time, place, occaſion, or company, as was much prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed in the revival of 1741, and 1742, obſerves— <q>I muſt confeſs, this is a practice that appears to me attended with many inconveniences, yea, big with miſchieſs. The abundant trial of this method lately made, and the large experience we have had of the evil conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it, is enough to put all ſober and judiciout people forever out of conceit of it.—Not that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, but greatly approve of perſons ſpeaking ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of their religious experiences in private conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, to proper perſons and on proper occaſions, with modeſty and diſcretion, when the glory of God, and the benefit or juſt ſatisfaction of others require it of them.</q> Humble inquity concerning the qualifications requiſite to a complete ſtanding, and full communion, in the viſible Chriſtian church, firſt publiſhed in 1749.

<p>The ſubjects of the late work in New-England, have freely opened the exerciſes of their minds to their teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and other Chriſtian friends; and have very generally avoided the error which Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> expoſes. They have not been confident of their converſion; and have been inquiſitive to learn the diſtinguiſhing nature of real piety. They have been diſpoſed to make the Bible their ſtudy; in which they have been not a little aſſiſted by making ſome portion of ſcripture the theme of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in religious conferences. They have not appeared forward in profeſſing religion; nor have they been wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to refrain from it. They, in general, maintain ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety in their lives. I am ſenſible that their future per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering holy walk, will afford the beſt evidence of their gracious ſincerity. Let them remember this.</p>

SOMETIMES Chriſtians of high improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in holineſs, and who enjoy propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable aſſurance, are ſo intent in looking on the corruptions of their hearts, that it
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:036872_0169_100B2863366FE5D8"/>ſeemeth to them for a ſeaſon, hardly poſſible that they ſhould be the ſubjects of ſaving knowledge. He who is mourning for his ſins, in the exerciſe of godly ſorrow, may exclaim, <q>I fear that my will was never bowed to the divine will! Is it poſſible that ſuch a finner as I am can belong to the family of the Redeemer! I have not a word to ſay againſt the juſtice of God, if he ſend me to hell! O Lord, thy gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment is perfect! May thy great and holy name be magnified forever! I aſk forgiveneſs for Chriſt's ſake, becauſe thou canſt glorify thyſelf in pardoning the chief of ſinners through his atoning blood! Should I be ſaved, what a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful monument of thy rich and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign grace ſhall I be! Under what infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite obligation ſhall I be, to eternity, to unite in the ſong, <hi>Worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain to receive power, and riches, and wiſdom, and ſtrength, and honour, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and bleſſing!</hi>
                  </q> Do you not, brethren, find peace following thoſe ſeaſons when you can thus confeſs to God, and thus lift up your hearts to him? Can you not adopt the language of his people, in ancient days, <hi>The Lord is my portion, ſaith my ſoul; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will I hope in him?</hi>

YE followers of Jeſus Chriſt, remember his dying charge, <hi>Watch and pray, that ye en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not into temptation.</hi> The longer you live, the more you will be impreſſed with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of <hi>taking unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withſtand in the evil day, and having done all to ſtand. Stand, therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breaſt-plate of right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs, and your feet ſhod with the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the goſpel of peace: Above all, taking the ſhield of faith, wherewith ye ſhall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. And take the helmet of ſalvation, and the ſword of the ſpirit, which is the word of God: Praying always with all prayer and ſupplication in the ſpirit, and watching thereunto with all perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ſupplication for all ſaints.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Ephes. vi. 13—18.</note> While you are ſupplicating for the whole of Chriſt's family on the earth, pray fervently for his miniſters in particular, that utterance may be given unto them, that thay may open their mouths boldly, to make known the myſtery of the goſpel.

Be ready at all times for the coming of your Lord and Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Acquaint yourſelves abundantly with the doctrines of the Bible. Study this holy
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:036872_0171_100B28671964E678"/>book with diligence and prayer. Guard againſt an unſteady, wavering temper; and indulge not a vain curioſity in liſtening to the endleſs variety of opinions. With a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, a meek, and a devout temper, ſearch the ſcriptures to diſcover what form of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God requireth; and when you are ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfied, run not from denomination to denom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination; either becauſe there are things amiſs in the people of your own, or becauſe you may have a good opinion of ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals who belong to other denominations of Chriſtians. Your growth in grace, and your influence, will be greatly obſtructed, if you are actuated by a temper which is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther capricious, or trifling, eſpecially in a matter which relates to the God whom you openly profeſs to love and adore. Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers will be ſtrengthened in their rejection of the goſpel, if they diſcover in you an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable mind; and they will fortify them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in that ſtrong hold of Satan to which many fly for refuge at the preſent time, viz. <q>That faith has no certain foundation: or that any creed is made good by believing it.</q> Brethren, you all abhor this infidel ſentiment. You know that no ſuch leſſon was ever taught in the ſchool of Chriſt. As you love him, and the ſouls of ſinners, beware of doing any thing which tends to
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:036872_0172_100B2868B7861898"/>ſtrengthen the hands of the wicked, and to make the kingdom of your Lord appear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible in the eyes of his enemies. Be faithful in your reſpective places, in promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the cauſe of the Redeemer. Let it lie near your hearts; and withhold no exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in your power, and ſhrink from no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, for its advancement. Be ever rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to perform the offices which Chriſtian benevolence dictates, to all your fellow mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, as opportunities preſent. Feel for the flock of God.—Be kind to its members.— Rejoice in their conſolation.—Recal them when wandering.—Comfort them in their ſorrows.—Relieve their wants according to your ability.—Feed the hungry and clothe the naked: And make it manifeſt by your whole conduct that your treaſure is in heaven.</p>
               <p>GOD hath called you to glory and virtue: Be obedient to his will in all things. Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe all the duties which are included in love to God and our neighbour. <hi>I beſeech you, therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye preſent your bodies a living ſacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reaſonable ſervice. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God.</hi>

               <p>THE reſt which remaineth for the people of God, is very imperfectly underſtood by them in the preſent life. <hi>For we know in part, and we propheſy in part. But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part ſhall be done away. When I was a child I ſpake as a child, I underſtood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childiſh things. For now we ſee through a glaſs darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then ſhall I know even as alſo I am known.</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Cor. xiii. 9—12.</note> The difference between the ſaints on earth, and the ſaints in glory,
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:036872_0174_100B286E11B76A68"/>is very great. The former cannot view the kingdom of God in the ſame clear light, as do the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect. There is a ſmall beginning of heaven in the heart of every one who has paſſed through the new birth. He hath choſen the Lord for his portion, and he deſires the enjoyment of him above all things. He hath had a foretaſte of the heavenly inheritance, and while in the earthly houſe of this tabernacle he ſometimes groans, earneſtly deſiring to be clothed upon with his houſe which is from heaven. Doubtful as the Chriſtian may be of his own ſtate, there is implanted within him a holy love which prefers being preſent with the Lord to a continuance in the fleſh.</p>
               <p>THE death of believers is an inlet to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting joys. When the ſoul is diſlodged from the body their eyes are inſtantly opened upon the world of glory. Now they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from ſin and ſorrow, and they behold Chriſt without the medium of faith. Now they realize the, formance of his gracious words, <hi>In my Father's houſe are many manſions: if it were not ſo, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a place for you, I will come again, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you unto myſelf; that where I am, there ye may be alſo.</hi>

They ſhall hunger no more, neither thirſt any more; neither ſhall the ſun light on them, nor any heat.

               <p>WHEN any from our world are received into heaven, they aſſociate with the glorified ſaints and the holy angels. Within a ſhort time, my Chriſtian friends, you will paſs through death, and will be welcomed to paradiſe by the angels, who are miniſtering ſpirits to the heirs of ſalvation. You will ſoon dwell in the ſame ſociety with Noah, Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob, Moſes, Samuel, David, Iſaiah, Daniel, Peter, James, John, Paul, and all the other holy patriarchs, prophets, and apoſtles, and all the ſaints who have departed this life from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of time. What raviſhing enjoyments muſt be found, in uniting with the holy throng above, in praiſing God forever? They are all of one heart towards Him who ſitteth on the throne.

In heaven, the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of one is the happineſs of the other, the happineſs of each is the happineſs of the whole, and the happineſs of the whole is the happineſs of each. They are all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the full dominion of holy love. This fixes their hearts on God, and draws them to each other by a bond which is never to be diſſolved. Look up to heaven, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a perfect ſociety. Can you look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to it, and not feel a deſire to go, at the time which infinite wiſdom hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and join with the worſhippers in the new Jeruſalem, and mingle ſouls with them to eternity? They feel to themſelves as noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the preſence of Jehovah, and they rejoice in the plan of his government which hath been unfolding from the firſt moment of created exiſtence. They are filled with joy in view of the glory and bleſſedneſs of God's holy kingdom. They ſhout, Alleluia! in beholding Him who is ſeated on the throne of the univerſe, triumphing over all the ſubtilty and malice of earth and hell, and rendering them ſubſervient to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of his infinite love.</p>
