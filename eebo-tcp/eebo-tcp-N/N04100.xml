            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Love to GOD is a Grace of the Spirit, whereby we eſteem and deſire him above all, and cleave to him as to our chief Good with holy Delight, from a ſpiritual Sight of his moſt amiable Perfections, as manifeſted in his Word and Works, and in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our Lord JESUS CHRIST. Under this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Deſcription I may ſay more particularly,</p>
               <p n="1">1. LOVE to GOD is a <hi>Grace of the Holy Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LOVE, conſider it as an Affection or Paſſion whereby the Soul uniteth with that which appears amiable, is natural to us, and in its own Nature good, being from GOD: The Object of this uniting Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is whatever is apprehended to be good for us. And as this Paſſion was in our firſt Parents while they retained their Integrity, it had not only a phyſical, but moral Goodneſs, being placed on GOD as the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005054_0005_101692108165AE68"/>
ſupreme Good, and Fountain of all Happineſs; and upon the Creature in due Meaſure, and in a regular Subordination. But when Sin entred, <hi>Adam</hi> loſt that divine Impreſſion which was on this Affection: He became an idolatrous Lover of himſelf, and of thoſe carnal Pleaſures whereby ſinful Self is gratified. And now ſince the Fall, the Character of Men is that, <hi>Lovers of their own ſelves. Lovers of Pleaſures more than Lovers of GOD,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.2,—4. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they can find no true Satisfaction, they dote on many Lovers. And as their Inclination is turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Creatures which gratify their Luſts; ſo they have a dreadful Averſion to GOD and his holy Law, which ſtand in Oppoſition to them. They delight not themſelves in the Almighty. The Character of Men left to the Darkneſs and Corruption of their own Minds is that, Rom. 1.30. <hi>Haters of GOD.</hi> Yea, when JESUS the Light of the World appear'd, many even of his own People loved Darkneſs rather than Light, becauſe their Deeds were evil. <hi>Now have they both ſeen, and hated both me and my Father,</hi> Joh. 15.24. Accurſed Malignity. Is it poſſible? Yes, the <hi>carnal Mind is Enmity againſt GOD,</hi> Rom. 8.7. The Holineſs and Juſtice of GOD appearing in the Commands and Sanction of his Law, are very dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to the Sinner: The Preſence of GOD is offenſive to him, he doth not like to retain GOD in his Knowledge; yea, he ſays to GOD, <hi>Depart from me, I deſire not the Knowledge of thy Ways,</hi> Job 21.14. This is the vile and wretched State of Men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til GOD renew them in the Spirit of their Minds, and ſo write this Law of Love upon their Hearts by his holy Spirit. Gal. 5.22. <hi>The Fruit of the Spirit is
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005054_0006_101692120C80BAB8"/>
Love.</hi> This is Part of the divine Image drawn on the Hearts of Men when the GOD of Love cometh to dwell in them by his Spirit: They love the Lord, and hate Evil. And when this holy Impreſſion is made on the Will and Affections, the Sinner who was going away from the bleſſed GOD, returns to him as his Reſt and Happineſs. Which leads me to ſay,</p>
               <p n="2">2. HE that loveth GOD, <hi>eſteems and deſires him above all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Language of the Soul is that, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none upon Earth that I deſire beſides thee,</hi> Pſal. 73.25. GOD is infinite Gdodneſs, and there's nothing good but as it deriveth from him. <hi>There is none good but one, that is GOD,</hi> Matth. 19.17. And therefore muſt we eſteem him above all other Beings, or we do not truly love him; for his Name alone is excellent, his Glory is above the Earth and Heaven. GOD alone is the Object of our religious Devotion in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and the Deſires of our Souls muſt be to his Name above every Name. Deſire and Joy may be call'd different Modifications of Love, as the Object is conſider'd to be abſent or preſent. Agreeably, when a Child of GOD, who is born from above, is made ſenſible of the infinite Amiableneſs of GOD, and of the great Diſtance at which Sin hath ſet him from this glorious Object; he reacheth after GOD in fervent Deſires and Longings of Soul. The inward Breathings of GOD's People after him, are well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd by the Pſalmiſt when driven from GOD's Houſe and Ordinances into the Wilderneſs of <hi>Judah, O GOD, thou art my GOD, early will I ſeek thee: my
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005054_0007_1016921645202DF8"/>
Soul thirſteth for thee, my Fleſh longeth for thee,</hi> Pſal. 63.1. Such are the Deſires of them that truly love GOD, and have this Love in a lively Exerciſe; and theſe Deſires give Wings to the Soul as it were, they mount up as Eagles towards Heaven. They aſpire after the perfect Enjoyment of the bleſſed GOD, and can't be fully ſatisfied till they are preſent with the LORD in Heaven, where is Fulneſs of Joys. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> when in the lively Exerciſe of this Love, had <hi>a Deſire to depart,</hi> and be with CHRIST. And the longing Deſires of GOD's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple after the glorious Appearing of their GOD and Saviour, we have expreſs'd at the Cloſe of the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Even ſo, come, LORD JESUS.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. IN the Exerciſe of this Love, <hi>GOD's People take Complacency in him as their chief Good, and cleave to him in holy Delight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Language of ſuch as truly love GOD is that,<hi>Return unto thy Reſt, O my Soul, for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee,</hi> Pſal. 116.7. They reſt in GOD as the only ſatisfying Portion of their Souls, ſaying as the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Thou art my Portion, O LORD.</hi> Love is a uniting Affection, and it takes Pleaſure in the Enjoyment of the Object beloved, and rejoiceth when in the neareſt Union with it. Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, he that truly loveth GOD, obeys that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Delight thy ſelf in the LORD,</hi> Pſal. 37.4. He delights in drawing nigh to GOD, and holding Communion with him. From his Heart he ſays, It is good for me to draw near to GOD; the nearer the better in his Account. He goes to GOD as to his exceeding great Joy, and when it pleaſeth GOD to give him the evident Tokens of his gracious Preſence
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005054_0008_1016921A5252A0C8"/>
and Favour, this is better to him than all Earthly Joy, than the Joy of Harveſt. <hi>There be many that ſay, Who will ſhew us any good? LORD, lift thou up the Light of thy Countenance upon us. Thou haſt put Gladneſs in my Heart, more than in the Time that their Corn and their Wine increaſed,</hi> Pſal. 4.6, 7. Such delight in all GOD's Attributes, in his Holineſs and Juſtice, as well as in his Grace and Mercy; which appears in their earneſt Deſires and Endeavours to perfect Holineſs in the Fear of the LORD. They alſo delight in GOD's <hi>Law</hi> after the inner Man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the Will of GOD declared to them. They likewiſe rejoice in the Day which the LORD has made, and call the <hi>Sabbath</hi> their Delight; becauſe this Day is holy to the Lord, and the bleſſed Seaſon for Communion with him. They love the Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>GOD's Houſe,</hi> the Place where his Honour dwells. <hi>How amiable are thy Tabernacles, O LORD of Hoſts!</hi> Pſal. 84.1. However, they are not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with a bodily Attendance on Ordinances, when they do not find and enjoy GOD in them; but when GOD draweth nigh to their Souls in the Ways of his Appointment, they are ſatisfied with the good things of his Houſe as with Marrow and Fatneſs, and praiſe him with joyful Lips. In a Word, where there is this <hi>Love ſhed abroad in the Heart by the Spirit,</hi> we chooſe GOD as our chief Good and higheſt End, and cleave to him with holy Satisfaction. Indeed, our Love in this Life will at beſt fall ſhort of ſinleſs Perfection, and the Exerciſe of it muſt be more or leſs obſtructed by remaining Corruption. Alas! the beſt of GOD's Children here find ſad Occaſion to complain of the Coldneſs and Deadneſs of their Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005054_0009_1016921BDBED5678"/>
while engag'd in religious Duties. However when this Love is in a lively Exerciſe, there's holy Joy in the LORD: Now they can ſay, <hi>My Heart is fixed, O GOD, my Heart is fixed, I will ſing and give Praiſe:</hi> Unleſs when it pleaſeth a wife and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign GOD to hide his Face, then they are troubled for want of the ſenſible Manifeſtations of his gracious Preſence. And when this is the ſorrowful Caſe, their Love expreſſeth it ſelf in an holy mourning after God, <hi>Mine Eye runneth down with Water, becauſe the Comforter that ſhould relieve my Soul, is far from me,</hi> Lam. 1.16.</p>
               <p n="4">4. THIS Love to GOD <hi>is drawn forth by a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving View of GOD, his moſt amiable Perfections and Attributes, as theſe are manifeſted in his Works, his Word, and the Perſon of our Lord JESUS CHRIST.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THERE is no Deſire of, or Love to that which is unknown. We muſt therefore be renewed after the Image of GOD in Knowledge, Righteouſneſs and Holineſs: And as there muſt be a Likeneſs to GOD in his imitable Perfections inwrought into the Soul as a Principle of Union, without this the moſt excellent and glorious Being cannot be agreeable and pleaſing to us; ſo there muſt be a ſpiritual Sight of this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Object to draw forth the actings of Love. <hi>Faith,</hi> which is the Evidence of Things not ſeen, <hi>worketh by Love,</hi> Gal. 5.6. When the Eyes of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding are enlightned, and we can ſay, Mine Eye ſeeth thee; we ſhall not only abhor our ſelves for our moſt unnatural Rebellion againſt our heavenly Father, but alſo return to our Duty in filial Love. <hi>Moſes</hi> by Faith ſaw him who is inviſible, and then refus'd to be call'd the Son of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daughter; <hi>Eſteeming

<hi>Philippians,</hi> as Chap. 1.9, 10. <hi>And this I pray, that your Love may abound yet more and more in Knowledge, and in all Judgment; that ye may approve Things that are excellent.</hi> He that truly loveth GOD hath a ſaving Diſcovery of his infinite Excellency, a believing Sight of his Glory as revealed in his Word and Works, and in the Perſon of our Lord JESUS CHRIST. The Heathen had ſome general Notions of GOD's Perfections, thoſe of them which are made known in the Works of Creation and common Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and accordingly they ſtiled their <hi>Jupiter</hi> the beſt and the greateſt. But alas! notwithſtanding this, <hi>when they knew GOD, they glorified him not as GOD, neither were thankful, but became vain in their Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and their fooliſh Heart was darkned. And changed the Glory of the uncorruptible GOD, into an Image made like to corruptible Man, and to Birds, and four-footed Beaſts, and creeping Things,</hi> Rom. 1.21,—23. The Light of Nature is not ſufficient to direct our Hearts into the Love of GOD. We muſt by Faith receive the Witneſs which GOD's Works together with his Word give concerning him, or our Hearts will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be drawn forth towards him in this holy Love. <hi>Through Faith we underſtand that the Worlds were framed by the Word of GOD, ſo that Things which are ſeen were not made of Things which do appear,</hi> Heb. 11.3. There was no pre-exiſtent Matter when GOD began to create the World; but all Things were made of Nothing by the Word of GOD's Power. Accordingly, when the Believer lifts up his Eyes to the Heavens which declare the Glory of GOD, or
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005054_0011_101692201ECB2208"/>
looks to the Earth which is full of his Goodneſs; he admiring ſays, <hi>How excellent is thy Name in all the Earth! Thy Glory is above the Heavens.</hi> But GOD hath magnified his Word above all his Name upon the Account of the Diſcoveries which he has been pleaſed herein to make of himſelf, and the only Way of Salvation by a Redeemer. The Way of the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's Recovery by CHRIST could not be known 'till it pleaſed GOD to reveal it. In this Revelation GOD paſſeth before us, and proclaims, <hi>The LORD, The LORD GOD, merciful and gracious, long-ſuffering, and abundant in Goodneſs and Truth, keeping Mercy for Thouſands, forgiving Iniquity, and Tranſgreſſion, and Sin,</hi> Exod. 34.6, 7. Herein GOD gives the Light of the Knowledge of himſelf in the Perſon of CHRIST, who is the <hi>Brightneſs of the Father's Glory.</hi> Here the Perfections of GOD, which are infinitely excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, appear moſt amiable unto us, when we behold them in CHRIST God-Man Mediator, conſpiring to promote the Salvation of loſt, miſerable Man. And now the Believer, adoring ſays, How great is his Goodneſs! How great is his Beauty! It was the Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>One, I would not have an abſolute GOD,</hi> that is, a GOD out of CHRIST. Out of CHRIST GOD is a conſuming Fire to Sinners; and if we thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him, we may well fly from him with that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing Cry, <hi>Who among us ſhall dwell with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring Fire? Who among us ſhall dwell with everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Burnings?</hi> Accordingly, our <hi>firſt Parents,</hi> when they had loſt GOD's Image, and expos'd themſelves to his Wrath and Curſe by their Tranſgreſſion, hid themſelves from the Preſence of the LORD, afraid to ſee his Face as a righteous Judge and Avenger of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005054_0012_1016922327EC2F30"/>
Sin. But now in CHRIST we behold GOD recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling Sinners to himſelf, and may ſay with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>John, GOD is Love.</hi> What higher Teſtimony could be given than this, the Father's ſo loving us as to give his Son to take our Nature, and die for us? The Believer feels the Power of it conſtraining him to love GOD with mutual Affection. And ſtill the Love of GOD is further ſhed abroad in his Heart, when he can with the Aſſurance of Faith ſay concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his GOD and Saviour, <hi>He has loved me, and given himſelf for me.</hi> Propriety in any deſireable Object, much more in One infinitely worthy our higheſt Love, is very endearing. How tranſporting muſt it be to ſay, <hi>He is altogether lovely;</hi> This is <hi>my Beloved,</hi> and this is my Friend? Surely ſuch an one muſt be conſtrain'd to ſay with <hi>Peter,</hi> Lord, thou knoweſt all Things, <hi>Thou knoweſt that I love thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. I ſhall endeavour further to explain this Duty, by conſidering <hi>what is intended in loving GOD with all the Heart, with all the Soul, and with all the Mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BEFORE I ſpeak particularly to this Head, I would obſerve to you, that this Duty of Love is here ſo fully expreſs'd, that our Love to GOD muſt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated in ſinleſs Perfection, before we can keep this great Command according to the full Extent of theſe Words. While we are in this imperfect State, there will be ſome ſinful Defect in our Love to GOD, and ſome criminal Exceſs in our Love to the Creature. However in a qualified Senſe, as Sincerity is called Perfection, every one that loveth GOD truly, may be ſaid to love him with all the Heart,— By <hi>Heart</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:005054_0013_10169226E5E8E138"/>
as here uſed, ſome underſtand the <hi>Will:</hi> We muſt chooſe GOD with our whole Heart. By <hi>Soul,</hi> ſome underſtand the <hi>Affection.</hi> By <hi>Mind,</hi> the <hi>Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> which is the leading Faculty. In <hi>Mark</hi> we read, <hi>with all the Underſtanding,</hi> as the Command is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, ch. 12. v. 33. In <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> where this Command is mentioned, <hi>Mind</hi> is omitted, and <hi>Might</hi> is added. In <hi>Mark, with all thy Strength</hi> is added, ch. 12. v. 30. But we need not be critical in exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the particular Senſe of each Expreſſion; take them together, they may imply ſuch Things as theſe following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. WE muſt love GOD <hi>with Sincerity, in Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to hypocritical Pretences. My little Children, let us not love in Word, neither in Tongue, but in Deed and in Truth,</hi> 1 Joh. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 18.</p>
               <p>OUR Love to GOD muſt be hearty, and in this Reſpect we muſt worſhip him in Spirit and in Truth. Behold, <hi>thou deſireſt Truth in the inward Parts,</hi> Pſal. 5<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> The inward Motions and Affections of the Heart muſt agree with our outward Expreſſions of Love. We muſt take heed we be not like them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31. <hi>They come unto thee as the People co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, and they ſit before thee as my People, and they bear thy Words, but they will not do them: For with their Mouth they ſhew much Love, but their Heart go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after their Covetouſneſs.</hi> GOD ſearcheth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth the Heart. <hi>My Son, give me thine Heart,</hi> Prov. 23.26. And we highly diſhonour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him, if we lie to the Lord in our outward Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; and we may depend upon it the holy GOD will reject us with Abhorrence, and give us our Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Hypocrites, except we repent. <hi>The End of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005054_0014_1016922B08133708"/>
the Commandment is Charity, out of a pure Heart, and of a good Conſcience, and of Faith unfeigned,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. THERE muſt be <hi>Integrity, in Oppoſition to a divided Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WE muſt take Care we be not of double Heart. There muſt not be an Heart for GOD, and an Heart for the World too; for our Saviour aſſureth us, <hi>No Man can ſerve two Maſters: For either he will hate the one, and love the other; or elſe he will hold to the one, and deſpiſe the other. Ye cannot ſerve GOD and Mammon,</hi> Matth. 6.24. We muſt chooſe and love GOD with a perfect Heart; we muſt cleave to him wholly, and have our Hearts united in his Love, as well as in his Fear. We muſt give the LORD our whole Souls, and not willingly withhold any Thing from him. Every Power muſt be devoted to GOD's Service, and the Dominion of every Luſt taken away. We muſt have Reſpect to all GOD's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments from Love to him, and hate every falſe Way. If there be any <hi>Idol</hi> retain'd, the Love of GOD doth not reign in us. <hi>Their Heart is divided; now ſhall they be found faulty,</hi> Hoſ. 10.2. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely glorious Jehovah will bear no Rival.</p>
               <p n="3">3. OUR Love to GOD <hi>muſt exceed all our other Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WE muſt eſteem him moſt excellent, and our Love to him muſt be ſuperlative. <hi>If any Man come to me, and hate not his Father, and Mother, and Wife, and Children, and Brethren, and Siſters, yea, and his own Life alſo, he cannot be my Diſciple,</hi> Luk. 14.26. Not as if Chriſtians might be without natural Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. By no means; but then ſo far as our neareſt
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005054_0015_1016922CA4E35FE8"/>
and deareſt Enjoyments would tempt us to turn from the bleſſed GOD; ſo far muſt we treat them as evil, and not count our very Lives dear when they ſtand in Competition with the Glory and Enjoyment of GOD. Unleſs we love GOD above the Creature, and are in ſome true Meaſure willing to forſake all for him; our Love is not genuine. All the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Creature compar'd with the Goodneſs of GOD, is not ſo much as a Spark to the Sun, or a Drop to the Ocean. <hi>Finite</hi> bears no Proportion to <hi>Infinite.</hi> Accordingly our Love to GOD muſt excel. We ought to love nothing but in Subordination to GOD; for his ſake, and according to the Rule and Meaſure of his Will declared in his Word. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſuffered the Loſs of all Things, and <hi>counted them but Dung that he might win CHRIST.</hi> However, this doth not ſuppoſe that every true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is in a next Preparation to ſuffer Martyrdom for JESUS CHRIST. There may be a willing Mind, and ſome true Meaſure of Love, where there is not preſent Courage and Reſolution thus to ſuffer for CHRIST. <hi>The Spirit indeed is willing, but the Fleſh is weak,</hi> Matth. 26.41. But then, GOD's People may not ſatisfy themſelves with the loweſt Degree of that Love which is true for kind. No! They muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to grow in this Grace, and ſo to be going on towards Perfection.</p>
               <p n="4">4. WE muſt love GOD <hi>with the Strength of our Hearts; with a ſtrong and ardent Love, in Oppoſition to that which is languid and weak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WE muſt labour after that Love which is ſtronger than Death, and burns like the Fire which hath a moſt vehement Flame. Our Love to GOD ſhould
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005054_0016_1016922F4CD4BAA0"/>
be intenſe and active. In this Reſpect we ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to reſemble the holy <hi>Angels,</hi> who are as <hi>Flames of Fire</hi> for the Fervour and Activity of their Love; and are accordingly called <hi>Seraphim,</hi> burners Iſa. 6.2. We muſt burn in Love to GOD, and holy Zeal againſt Sin; ſo as to be not ſlothful in his Buſineſs, fervent in Spirit ſerving the LORD; doing, his Will on Earth in ſome Meaſure as the Angels do it in Heaven.</p>
               <p n="5">5. OUR Love to GOD muſt be <hi>intelligent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WE muſt have right Thoughts and ſpiritual Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of GOD leading and directing the other Faculties. It muſt be with the Underſtanding. We muſt frequently think of GOD, and our Meditation of him ſhould be ſweet unto us. One Character of the Wicked is that, <hi>GOD is not in all their Thoughts,</hi> Pſal. 10.4. We ſhould then muſe till the Fire burn, and often warm our Hearts with ſerious Tho'ts of the bleſſed GOD, his glorious Perfections, and wonderful Works. When the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> had been me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating of the Goodneſs of the LORD in his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Works to the Children of Men, he cloſeth the Pſalm with theſe Words, <hi>Whoſo is wiſe, and will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thoſe Things, even they ſhall underſtand the loving kindneſs of the LORD,</hi> Pſal. 107.43. The more we ſee of the Creature, the more we ſee its Vanity and Emptineſs; but the more we follow on to know the LORD, the more ſhall we ſee of his divine Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and Glory to increaſe our Eſteem and Love. But I forbear, and ſhall only further ſay in a Word: We ſhould with all the Powers of Soul and Body ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs our Love to GOD, devoting our ſelves wholly to him, employing all our Abilities in his Service,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005054_0017_1016923206259008"/>
and doing his Commandments with all our Might. I can't diſmiſs this ſecond Head without this Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, How far ſhort do we fall of our Duty! Surely this Commandment is exceeding broad. Which brings me to the third and laſt Head.</p>
               <p n="3">III. WHICH is to ſhew, that <hi>This is the firſt and great Commandment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THAT this is GOD's Command, is plain from the Old and New Teſtament. <hi>Hear, O lſrael, The LORD our GOD is one LORD. And thou ſhalt love the LORD thy GOD with all thine Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Might,</hi> Deut. 6.5, 6. But it would be to light a Candle in the Sun, to go about to prove that this is GOD's Commandment. We therefore proceed to ſhew that it deſerveth the Character here given; the firſt and great Commandment.</p>
               <p>THE Love of GOD is the <hi>firſt Commandment</hi> in Order and Dignity. In Order of Nature, ſays a worthy Divine, becauſe the Love of our Neighbour flows from our Love of GOD: And alſo in Dignity, ſays another, becauſe it commands us Things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning GOD. And the <hi>great Command.</hi> That is, ſays BEZA, "The greateſt of All; for otherwiſe, as he alſo obſerveth, there is nothing ſmall which GOD commands." Here to confirm and illuſtrate this laſt Head, I would ſay more particularly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. THE Love of GOD may fitly be called the firſt and great Command <hi>with reſpect to the Object of it, the infinitely great and good GOD, the firſt Cauſe, and laſt End of all Things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BEHOLD, GOD is great. <hi>Behold, the Nations are as Drop of a Bucket, and are counted as the ſmall
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005054_0018_10169234AEE71098"/>
Duſt of the Balance: Behold, he taketh up the Iſles as a very little thing. All Nations before him are as No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and they are counted to him leſs than Nothing, and Vanity,</hi> Iſa. 40.15,—17. A few Years paſt, ſo may we ſpeak when meditating on the Eternal GOD, there was no Creature exiſting; only this ſelf-exiſtent, ſelf-ſufficient Being, whoſe Name is JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH, from Everlaſting to Everlaſting. And now let the <hi>Univerſe</hi> ſtand in Compariſon with Him, and it ſhrinks into Nothing before Him, the infinite GOD. But we are Babes: Let the Angels then declare how great and good the LORD is. Behold, They alſo ſtand amazed in awful Silence before him, covering their Faces. The Tongues of Angels fail, and our moſt enlarged Thoughts are ſwallowed up. How great then is this Command objectively conſidered. Surely it challengeth the firſt and chief Place.</p>
               <p n="2">2. THIS will further appear if we conſider <hi>the Relations which GOD bears to his People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THAT GOD, who is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt; is the Creator, Redeemer and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier of his People. He is the Father of our Spirits, and Former of our Bodies. We were nothing 'till GOD gave us our Being, and that this excellent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and when we were worſe than Nothing by our Apoſtacy from GOD, it pleaſed the Father of Glory to fond his Son to redeem us. When GOD deliver'd the <hi>Ten Commandments</hi> to his ancient People, we have that Preface to them, <hi>I am the LORD thy GOD, which have brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, out of the Houſe of Bondage,</hi> Exod. 20.2. This was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a ſtrong Obligation upon them to love GOD, and keep his Commandments; but it is as nothing if
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005054_0019_1016923831A774D0"/>
compar'd with GOD's ſending his Son to take our Nature, and give his Life a Ranſom for us; and then with his ſending the Holy Spirit to apply the Benefit of this Eternal Redemption to us. What are our natural Parents, or ſpiritual Fathers in CHRIST, but Inſtruments of conveying to us the Goodneſs of GOD? Surely then the Love of GOD muſt ſtand as the firſt and chief Commandment.</p>
               <p n="3">3. THE Love of GOD is the firſt and great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, <hi>as it comprehends the Sum of the four firſt Commandments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WE commonly call theſe the <hi>firſt Table;</hi> tho' we do not certainly know how many Commandments were written on the firſt, and how many on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of the two Tables delivered to <hi>Moſes</hi> by GOD. However, it is plain theſe ſtand foremoſt as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern our Duty to GOD. And theſe great Matters of GOD's Law are all ſum'd up in this comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Command, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the LORD thy GOD with all thy Heart.</hi> Doth GOD require us to ſerve him only; with religious Worſhip, and that in the Ways of his own Appointment? Doth he require us to worſhip him with Reverence and godly Fear, and to beware of taking his Name in vain? Doth he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire us to ſanctify his Day by ſeparating our ſelves from worldly Cares and Buſineſs, and Pleaſures; and by devoting that holy Time to religious Exerciſes? In theſe Commands GOD has written to us the great Things of his Law, and all is comprehended in this <hi>of Love.</hi> Well then may it be call'd the firſt and great Commandment.</p>
               <p n="4">4. THIS is in a Senſe, <hi>the End and Perfection of other Commandments.</hi> This may be ſaid of Love in
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005054_0020_1016923BEFB1F218"/>
general, and in an eſpecial Manner of this Love of GOD. <hi>The End of the Commandment is Charity,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.5. This is what GOD deſigns in the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he requireth of us, even to perfect his Love in us. And this is what we ought very much to aim at in our Attendance on religious Duties, the Exerciſe and increaſe of Love. This is one great End of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Goſpel-Miniſtry, that the Body of CHRIST, his Church may be <hi>edified in Love.</hi> The moſt excellent Gifts without this, are as nothing in GOD's Account, and the moſt coſtly Performances, the giving our Goods to feed the Poor, and our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to be burned, profit not without this Love, which is very much the animating Life and Soul of true Obedience, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1, 2. But where there is true Love to GOD in Exerciſe, a willing Mind is accepted according to what a Man hath, and the giving a Cup of cold Water ſhall not loſe its Reward.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>This Love ſhall never fail.</hi> 1 Cor. 13.8. And upon this Account eſpecially Love is ſaid to be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Faith and Hope. 13 v. <hi>And now abideth Faith, Hope, Charity, theſe three; but the greateſt of theſe is Charity.</hi> Not as if Faith and Hope would abſolutely fail, and ceaſe as to their Exiſtence. We are requir'd to <hi>truſt in the LORD for ever.</hi> But then Faith and Hope, thoſe excellent Graces, may be ſaid to fail reſpecting ſome principal Office or Exerciſe in which they are of eminent Uſefulneſs in the preſent Life; <hi>Faith,</hi> as it is the Evidence of Things not ſeen, will ceaſe, when we ſhall walk by <hi>Sight.</hi> Faith, as it is a <hi>Shield</hi> to defend us from the fiery Darts of the Wicked, ſhall not be uſed, when our Warfare is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. We are now commanded, <hi>above all to
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005054_0021_1016923D7AD6E1A8"/>
take the Shield of Faith.</hi> But there will be no further Need of it or Uſe for it under this Character, when the Believer ſhall triumph for ever in Heaven; for the <hi>old Serpent</hi> can't enter the <hi>heavenly Paradiſe</hi> to tempt GOD's People. But now when Faith ſhall as it were be ſwallowed up in the open Viſion of GOD, and Hope in the full Enjoyment of him; then ſhall Love, be perfected for ever reſpecting its higheſt Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Then there will be the higheſt Exerciſe of Love in Delight and Joy. The Manſions of Glory are the happy Places in which Knowledge and Love are for ever compleated; and yet, the Object being infinite, I can't ſee why they may not continue to grow and increaſe to all Eternity. O divine Life! To have the higheſt Actings of Love on an infinitely glorious Object moſt intimately preſent, and moſt fully manifeſting his Love to us. O Joy unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and full of Glory! Surely our perfect Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to GOD's Will in this great Matter of his Law, is our higheſt Perfection and Bleſſedneſs. In keeping this Commandment there's <hi>a great Reward.</hi> When the glorified Saint loveth the LORD with all his Heart, and Mind, and Strength; he reacheth the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of all true Deſire and Perfection, and finds Reſt in the full Enjoyment of GOD to all Eternity.</p>
               <p>AND thus have I conſidered a few Things to ſhew the greatneſs of this Command; I now proceed to the</p>
            </div>
            <div type="application">
               <head>APPLICATION.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. We may learn from what hath been ſaid, that <hi>the Law of the LORD is perfect, and moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="unknown:005054_0022_101692403ACEF650"/>THUS we read, <hi>The Law of the LORD is perfect,</hi> Pſal. 19.7. It extends to the Heart and Conſcience, and requireth the Obedience both of the inward and outward Man. Well might the Pſalmiſt ſay, <hi>I have ſeen an End of all Perfection; but thy Commandment is exceeding broad,</hi> Pſal. 119.96. Divine and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent are its Commands, and it is the whole of Man to be obedient to them. It is alſo the Law of Love. Let us then ſay, <hi>O how love I thy Law!</hi> it is my Meditation all the Day. We ſhould highly eſteem the Law as a perfect Rule of Duty; but not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to depend upon it for Juſtification. No, it is weak through the Fleſh, by Reaſon of our Sin; and can't give Life. It is indeed perfect in itſelf, and Salvation had been by the Law, if we had kept it; but as it is now a Law broken by us, it can't give us Life; for it is written, <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all Things which are written in the Book of the Law to do them,</hi> Gal. 3.10. We may conclude then, that by the Deeds of the Law ſhall no Fleſh living be juſtified in the Sight of GOD. Dare any preſume to ſtand a Trial according to the Law as a Covenant of Works? Vain Man! Thou daily breakeſt GOD's Law in Thought, Word and Deed. Let us then humbly plead, <hi>Enter not into Judgment with thy Servants,</hi> for in thy Sight ſhall no Fleſh living be juſtified. And let the Law be as a School-Maſter to lead us to CHRIST, and teach us our Need of Him, who is the End of the Law for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. His Love and Obedience were every Way perfect, and equal to this great Command. But alas! our's are very imperfect at beſt. How much are our Affections diſtemper'd? How often do we feel a
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:005054_0023_1016924408E26A00"/>
feveriſh Heat of carnal Concupiſcence working in us ſo that when we go to offer GOD our Hearts, we are lame and defective. Surely we can't be accepted but in the <hi>Beloved.</hi> The Sins cleaving to our very beſt Duties need Pardon, and cleanſing in the Blood of JESUS. Let each one of us then ſay; <hi>I count all Things but Loſs, for the Excellency of the Knowledge of CHRIST JESUS my LORD: for whom I have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the Loſs of all Things, and do count them but Dung that I may win CHRIST, and be found in him, not having mine own Righteouſneſs, which is of the Law, but that which is through the Faith of CHRIST, the Righteouſneſs which is of GOD by Faith,</hi> Phil. 3.8, 9.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Here we ſee how to judge of our Duties, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Performances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WE come before GOD as his People; hear his Word, and do many Things. But can we ſay, that true Love to GOD is the inward Spring and active Principle from which theſe religious Actions proceed? Do we attend on GOD's Worſhip from an hearty Deſire of Communion with him? <hi>Do we as new born Babes deſire the ſincere Milk of the Word,</hi> that we may grow thereby? And do we receive the Truth in the Love of it, as thoſe that are deſirous to prove what is that good, and perfect, and acceptable Will of GOD? And then, Do we in <hi>Prayer</hi> offer up our ſincere De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to GOD, as the true Seed of <hi>Jacob,</hi> who cannot bear to go away without his Bleſſing? Is this our great Petition, <hi>Lord, lift thou up the Light of thy Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance upon us?</hi> When we ſit at the <hi>Lord's Table,</hi> Do we renumber CHRIST's Love more than Wine, and yield our ſelves to him according to the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005054_0024_10169246AB82C370"/>
as thoſe who are not our own, being bought with the Price of his moſt precious Blood? In a Word, Is the remaining Deadneſs and Coldneſs of Affection in Duty our heavy Burden? This true God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is profitable to all Things; but bodily Exerciſe without it will profit little. And unleſs this holy Fire of Love be enkindled in our Hearts, we ſhall not offer to GOD ſpiritual Sacrifices acceptable through CHRIST; but may expect that GOD will reject us and our Services, tho' we ſhould often appear before him as his People.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Learn the great Sin, and Evil of living in Enmity againſt GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To love the LORD our GOD with all the Heart, we have heard, is the firſt and great Command. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly then ſuch are great Tranſgreſſors, who under the clear Revelation of GOD's Word, are Lovers of Pleaſures more than Lovers of GOD; who love the World, and the Things of the World above GOD. This muſt be an heinous Violation of GOD's Law, and highly provoking to him who is a jealous GOD, <hi>viſiting the Iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children of them that hate him.</hi> How often have ſuch appeared to be the abhorred of the LORD, and their Poſterity following their Steps? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.11,—13. But it may be ſome imagine they love GOD, and the World too. But O Self-deceiver! Hear the Word of the LORD, <hi>Love not the World, neither the Things that are in the World. If any Man love the World, the Love of the Father is not in him,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.15. The idolatrous Love we are now ſpeaking of, is utterly
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:005054_0025_1016924833A8F1F0"/>
inconſiſtent with the true Love of GOD; and where it governs, the Heart is full of Enmity againſt GOD. <hi>The Friendſhip of the World is Enmity with GOD: Whoſoever therefore will be a Friend of the World, is the Enemy of GOD,</hi> Jam. 4.4. Now how great a Sin muſt this be to continue in Enmity againſt the infinitely good GOD, our Maker, Preſerver and great Benefactor; againſt this GOD, who has manifeſted his Love beyond our higheſt Conceptions, in ſending his Son to ſave a periſhing World; and ſends his Miniſters to beſeech us in his Name to be reconciled to him. O the vile Nature and great Aggravation of this Sin, which virtually contains Diſobedience to the whole Law and Goſpel too, and by both ſtands condemned as exceeding ſinful. Surely it is an Evil full of deadly Poyſon, no leſs deſtructive to us than it is offenſive to GOD. They that are far from GOD muſt periſh. <hi>My Soul lothed them, and their Soul alſo abhorred me,</hi> Zech. 11.8. If you continue in this Diſtance and Alienation from GOD, you muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part accurſed from him for ever into everlaſting Fire. Nothing remains for you, but that fiery Indignation which ſhall devour the Adverſaries. GOD was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in the Fleſh, and revealed in <hi>Flames of Love</hi> to ſave Sinners, of Love ſtronger than Death. What Malignity then muſt there be in the Hearts of them that deſpiſe him, and neglect ſo great Salvation? And how ſhall they eſcape, when he ſhall be revealed in <hi>flaming Fire, taking Vengeance on them that obey not his Goſpel.</hi> You may read your Doom, <hi>If any Man love not the Lord JESUS CHRIST, let him be Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, Maran-atha,</hi> 1 Cor. 16.22. When our LORD cometh again, you will fall under his moſt dreadful
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:005054_0026_1016924A12187DF8"/>
Curſe, and his Wrath ſhall abide upon you for ever.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Let us examine our ſelves whether we truly love GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS is the firſt and great Commandment, and therefore it muſt be a Matter of the greateſt Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance that we yield Obedience to it. Let us then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly enquire; Is our Love to GOD hearty? Is it ſuperlative? Do we chuſe him as our Portion, and deſire none in Heaven or Earth, in Compariſon with him? Do we truly give him our Hearts, mourning becauſe we do it no better? Do we ſincerely reach after the neareſt Union, and greateſt Conformity to GOD? Do we make it our Study and Care to pleaſe GOD by keeping his Commandments? <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.15. <hi>If ye love me, keep my Commandments.</hi> Are we afraid of GOD's Diſpleaſure; and do we hate Sin with an irreconcilable Hatred? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.10. <hi>Ye that love the LORD, hate Evil.</hi> Again, Are we much concerned for GOD's Glory in the World? Do we rejoice when his Name is hallowed, and mourn when it is profaned? Do the Intereſts of CHRIST's Kingdom lie near our Hearts, and are we glad when theſe proſper and flouriſh? This is a genuine Fruit of Love, to regard the Intereſts of the Perſon beloved ſomething as if they were our own. In a Word, Do we ſincerely love the Children of GOD, and that becauſe they bear his Image? 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.20. <hi>If a Man ſay, I love GOD, and hateth his Brother, he is a Liar: For he that loveth not his Brother whom he hath ſeen, how can he love GOD whom he hath not ſeen?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:005054_0027_1016924CD305A4E8"/>5. <hi>Let us all be exhorted to love GOD, and that with all our Hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Goodneſs of GOD was in a diſtinguiſhing Manner manifeſted to Man in his firſt Creation, in that the <hi>Father of Spirits</hi> formed him with a <hi>reaſonable Soul,</hi> capable of knowing and enjoying him for ever; and made him <hi>in his Image,</hi> and after his Likeneſs. It is our Sin and Miſery, that by the Fall we are alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from GOD, and Enemies in our Minds. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly then it muſt be our great Duty and Intereſt to return to the LORD our GOD who hath made us, and who alone can make us happy. Let us then cry to GOD for his holy Spirit, to deſtroy this accurſed Enmity; and to reconcile us to GOD by the Blood of CHRIST's Croſs. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>GOD ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life.</hi> GOD the Son was manifeſt in the Fleſh, and hath recommended his Love towards us, in that when we were Sinners, he died for us. Let this Love then conſtrain us to give up our ſelves to GOD by JESUS CHRIST; to love, obey, and ſerve him for ever according to the new Covenant. <hi>Kiſs the Son,</hi> believe in him, and embrace him as the only Saviour; then he will clothe you with his Righteouſneſs, and make you beautiful with his Comlineſs put upon you: And being eſpouſed to him in Righteouſneſs, and Judgment, and Loving kindneſs; GOD the Father will be well pleaſed with you; he <hi>will reſt in his Love,</hi> and rejoice over you with Singing. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Glory will own and bleſs you as his Children.

What need I ſay more to gain your Affections? But I know not how to leave you, now that I am upon a Subject on which your <hi>All</hi> depends. <hi>You will be happy or miſerable for ever, according as you place your Love.</hi> O hearken then, and conſider further: It muſt be a bleſſed Thing to love the beſt and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of Beings, and to be for ever beloved of him. All Things ſhall work together for good, to them, that love GOD: And they ſhall be more than Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors over all Evil, through him that hath loved them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38, 39. <hi>For I am perſwaded, that neither Death, nor Life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor Things preſent, nor Things to come, nor Height, nor Depth, nor any other Creature, ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the Love of GOD which is in CHRIST JESUS our LORD.</hi> And as to the Life to come, you may take the ſtrong Conſolation of thoſe Words, 1 Cor. 2.9. <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, neither have entred into the Heart of Man, the Things which GOD hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> In a Word, Let the Children of GOD abound more and more in their Love to him. There is no Danger of exceeding where the Object is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely excellent and glorious. And here to make the Fire burn, O remember, GOD has loved you with an everlaſting Love, and with Loving kindneſs has he drawn you to himſelf. He is before-hand with you in this Matter. 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.19. <hi>We love him; becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi> Nothing leſs than the divine Power and Love of God, was able to overcome your Evil. LORD, direct our Hearts into the Love of thy ſelf, and prepare us for that perfect State in which we ſhall for ever love thee with all our

Heart, and Soul, and Mind, and Strength! <hi>Jude</hi> 20, 21. <hi>But ye, Beloved, building up your ſelves on your moſt holy Faith, praying in the holy Ghoſt, keep your ſelves in the Love of GOD, looking for the Mercy of our Lord JESUS CHRIST unto eternal Life.</hi>
