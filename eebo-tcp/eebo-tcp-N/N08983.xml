            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is, no doubt, of the laſt importance, that people ſhould be convinced, and made thoroughly ſenſible of their impotence and helpleſneſs in themſelves, and their entire dependence on divine grace, for ſalvation. So long as ſinners think they can recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend themſelves to the favour of God, by their own righteouſneſs, they will never
<q>come unto Chriſt, that they might have life.</q>
For
<q>the whole have no need of the phyſician, but they that are ſick.</q>
And ſo long as perſons imagine they labour under no inſuperable ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, as to complying with the goſpel, they will never feel their dependence on him, who alone is able to work in them,
<q>the whole good pleaſure of his goodneſs, and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011467_0003_0F832F3578F37F90"/>
the work of faith with power.</q>
Nor will they feel diſpoſed, or ſee the occaſion they have, to
<q>give unto God the glory, which is indeed due unto his name,</q>
In their ſalvation. Accordingly, the depravity, blindneſs and deadneſs of mankind, in things of a ſpiritual nature, and their utter inability to comply with the goſpel, as well as to obtain ſalvation by the deeds of the law, are much inculcated and inſiſted on, in the ſacred ſcriptures.</p>
            <p>BUT then, there is a difficulty, in the minds of many, how to reconcile this total helpleſneſs of ſinners, with the ſincerity of the goſpel offers, or with the juſtice of men's being condemned and puniſhed, for their impenitence and unbelief. And indeed, it does ſeem as if men could not be to blame, for not doing impoſſibilities: Nor ſhould we in other caſes, think there was much kindneſs or ſincerity, in offering a favour on conditions that were known to be impracticable.</p>
            <p>THERE is ſcarce any one, I believe, that has ever tho't much about religion, but what has, at one time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, felt himſelf pinched with this difficulty. And it is won't to have a moſt pernicious influence upon the minds of ſinners in general; but more eſpecially, when they come to be under awakenings, and begin to enquire, "what they ſhall do to be ſaved." According to what they hear in ſermons, yea, and according to what they read in their bibles, they are greatly at a loſs to ſee, how the ways of the Lord can be equal. "The carnal mind," they are told,
<q>is — not ſubject to the law of God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed <hi>can</hi> be.</q>
And that,
<q>they that are in the fleſh <hi>cannot</hi> pleaſe God.</q>
They are therefore under a <hi>neceſſity</hi> of ſinning, yea, of doing nothing elſe but ſin. And yet, "every tranſgreſſion and diſobedience," is to receive a moſt dreadful "recompence of reward," the wrath of God being
<q>revealed from heaven, againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men.</q>
And no relief, no deliverence from wrath, is to be hoped for through the goſpel, but upon impoſſible conditions: Such
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:011467_0004_0F832F3612808AB0"/>
conditions as no natural man, no one who is dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, ever did, ever will, or can comply with. And yet a non-compliance with theſe conditions, expoſes to an amazingly aggravated, additional condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; inſomuch that it will be more tolerable for So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Gomorrah, in the day of judgment, than for thoſe who enjoy the light of the goſpel, and do not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the ſalvation it offers.</p>
            <p>But how theſe things are conſiſtent with reaſon; how they can ever be reconciled with the goodneſs, or the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of God, they are greatly at a loſs. Such a view of the matter, ſeems to them to make the Moſt High indeed, what the ſlothful ſervant ſaid, a hard maſter,
<q>reaping where he has not ſown, and gathering where he has not ſtrewed.</q>
Or, like the cruel Egyptian taſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters, requiring the full tale of brick, without allowing the neceſſary ſtraw; requiring that of his creatures which he knows exceeds their utmoſt ſtrength, and then they are beaten; yea, muſt be puniſhed with everlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, for not doing, what they would do with all their hearts, but it is no more in their power, than it is to make a world.</p>
            <p>Now, until this difficulty can be fairly got over in peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's minds, it ſeems impoſſible they ſhould, in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, juſtify God, or condemn themſelves as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns them. Or that they ſhould underſtand, either the juſtice of the divine law, or the grace of the goſpel. It is therefore certainly highly neceſſary, that what the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſays upon this ſubject, ſhould be ſet in a conſiſtent light, ſo as to commend itſelf to every man's conſcience, in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p>THERE are ſeveral ways, in which this has been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted. Some account for God's ſuſpending our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon impoſſible conditions, and condemning men for not doing what it is not in their power to do, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, that we loſt our power by the fall. Our preſent weakneſs and blindneſs, was brought upon us as a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011467_0005_0F832F38DE8D59A0"/>
puniſhment, for the diſobedience of Adam; and God, they ſay, has not loſt his right to command, becauſe man, by his own folly and ſin, has loſt his ability to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey. That is, we ought, it is our preſent real duty to exert, not only all the ſtrength we actually have, but all we ſhould have had, had it not been for the original a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy.</p>
            <p>BUT to this it will be objected, that we never reaſon and judge in ſuch a manner, in any other caſe. We do not think thoſe who have loſt their eyes, are ſtill to blame for not ſeeing; or thoſe who have loſt their reaſon, for not underſtanding; or that it is the duty of thoſe to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with their hands, who have no hands to labour with. Not, though we ſuppoſe they were deprived of thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, in a righteous manner, for their ſins. Or, ſuppoſe a ſervant, by his own folly and bad conduct, has brought a fit of ſickneſs upon himſelf; do we think it reaſonable for his maſter, ſtill to require him to go out into the field every day, and do as much work as if he was well? And is the ſervant to blame, in not obeying ſuch commands? Does he daily commit new ſin, in not working, when perhaps he now wiſhes with all his heart he was able to do it; but has not ſtrength enough to go a ſtep, or bear his weight?</p>
            <p>IT muſt, I think, be granted, we do generally ſuppoſe, a man's <hi>preſent</hi> duty cannot exceed his preſent ſtrength, even let his ſtrength have been impared by what means it will. We never hear even a good man, pretend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent or blame himſelf, that he has not ſeen the light of the ſun all day, and reſolve not to be guilty of the ſame ſin to-morrow, when he has been ſtone blind for twenty years. I ſhall not therefore, undertake the defence of this, as any ſolution of the difficulty, to the apprehenſion of reaſon and common ſenſe. Nor can I think that any one was ever inwardly convinced of the ſin of unbelief in this way. However well meant it might probably be, by the firſt inventers of it, it ſeems rather calculated to
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011467_0006_0F832F3989BEF308"/>
               <hi>eaſe</hi> the conſciencies of men, by caſting all real blame, back upon the firſt ſin only.</p>
            <p>OTHERS, (and thoſe who would not be thought, and are not ſuſpected, to leanin any meaſure towards arminianiſm) have ſuppoſed it neceſſary to ſoften matters a little, as to the ſovereignty of grace, and the helpleſneſs of ſinners, if we would avoid the above inconſiſtency, or reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the divine juſtice. They would have it maintained, indeed, that ſinners are unable to do much, if any thing towards their ſelvation, merely of themſelves. Nor do they ſuppoſe that any one is ever brought to true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and faith in Chriſt, without the ſpecial grace of God. But then they apprehend, it may, and muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that ſinners are able, by the help of <hi>common</hi> grace, to do thoſe things which are connected with, and may be conſidered as a ſort of preliminary conditions of ſalvation: conditions upon which regeneration, &amp; an ability to come up to the actual terms of the goſpel, is promiſed, or howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, will undoubtedly be beſtowed. That is, they ſuppoſe, if ſinners will ſeek and pray, uſe the means of grace, and do the beſt that perſons under their circumſtances, and having ſuch hearts as they have, <hi>may</hi> do; God will not be wanting on his part, or leave them to periſh. That if they exert all the ſtrength, and make a good improvement of all the aſſiſtance they have, they ſhall have more, and more given them; till in the end they are enabled to obtain mercy, and to lay hold on eternal life. That if there are no abſolute promiſes, to ſuch earneſt and ſincere, though feeble, efforts of the unregenerate, yet certainly there are many very precious encouragements; which may indeed, ſecurely enough be relied on. So that, on the whloe, no ſinner is under any real impoſſibility of obtaining ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For every one, let his impotence be as great as it will, can certainly do what he can. And if upon his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, God will not fail to help him, as to what he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do; then every one <hi>may</hi> be ſaved, any weakneſs or depravity he labours under, notwithſtanſting. Nor do
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011467_0007_0F832F3A081B8408"/>
they ſee how we can vindicate the divine juſtice, or fairly caſt the blame of the ſinners perdition on himſelf, without ſuppoſing ſuch a univerſal ſufficiency of grace, as this.</p>
            <p>Now if this can be made out to be really the caſe, that all are actually and in every view, <hi>enabled</hi> to do thoſe things which are connected with eternal life; there will be no difficulty, I apprehend, with any one, to ſee that the ways of the Lord are equal. For according to this, there ſeems to be no reſpect of perſons with God, even in the diſtribution of his freeſt favours, any more than in his judicial proceedings. The difference between him that is ſaved, and him that periſheth, not originating from any in equality in the beſtowment of divine grace; but ſolely from the better improvement one ſinner makes of the ſame grace, than another does. Here then the way is clear on the ſide of natural notions, reaſon, and common ſenſe.</p>
            <p>BUT, I am afraid, it will be as hard to reconcile this way of ſolving matters, with the ſcriptures, and with the truth of fact, as it is, the former one, with reaſon. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, the ſcriptures ſeems to ſpeak a language quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from this. In them we are taught,
<q>That it is God that maketh one man to differ from an other, for the better, and not he himſelf. That it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſhewith mercy.</q>
and "that he hath mercy, on whom he will bave mercy; and whom he will he harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth." And in our text, our Saviour accounts for the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring and oppoſition, of the unbeleiving jews, by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this obſervation to his diſciples upon it; "no man can come to me, except the father which hath ſent me draw him." By which he evidently ment to intimate, that the conduct of his oppoſers, conſidering what human nature was, was not to be wondered at. That they acted no otherways than all other men would, if left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as they were. That thoſe who now followed and obeyed him, would never have come to him or become
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011467_0008_0F832F3A9B64BDB8"/>
his diſciples, had it not been for a gracious divine influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon their minds, which was not granted to thoſe murmurers and oppoſers; had they not been effectually drawn, by him in whoſe hand are the hearts of men, and who turneth them as the rivers of water are turned. We are plainly taught in this text, taken in the connection in which it ſtands, as we are alſo in a multitude of other places, that men do not firſt diſtinguiſh themſelves, by hearkening to the calls of the goſpel; but that it is God that makes one to differ from another, in this reſpect, by his ſovereign and diſtinguiſhing grace. The point of doctrine, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that I ſhall inſiſt upon from the words is this,</p>
            <p>That none are <hi>able</hi> to comply with the goſpel, but thoſe who are the ſubjects of the ſpecial and <hi>effectual</hi> grace of God; or thoſe who are made willing, and actually <hi>do</hi> comply with it.</p>
            <p>WHAT I have in view, in the following diſcourſe, is not only to confirm this doctrine; but to endeavour to ſet it in ſuch a light, as to obviate the formentioned difficulty, of ſalvation's being offered on impoſſible conditions, and men's being condemned for not doing, that which they are incapable of. And after what has been ſaid, I think there is no way of attempting to clear up this myſtery, left, but by ſhewing that there are two eſſentially differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſenſes, in which men are ſaid to be incapable of doing things: or, by having recourſe to the diſtinction of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and moral inability. Accordingly, the method I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, is,

                  <item>I. AS clearly as I can, to ſtate and illuſtrate this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction.</item>
                  <item>II. TO ſhow, that men certainly labour under one, or the other, of theſe kinds of inability to comply with the goſpel, until they are made the ſubjects of effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual divine grace.</item>
                  <item>III. MORE particularly to conſider and evince, the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> impotence of ſinners, And</item>
                  <item>IV. ENDEAVOUR to make it appear, that there is, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011467_0009_0F832F3B79D9E408"/>
                     <hi>no other</hi> incapacity in ſinners, in this matter, but only of the moral kind.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. THEN, it is to be obſerved, for the clearing up of this ſubject, that there are two very different kinds of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability: ſo different, that the one however great does not leſſen moral obligation in the leaſt; whereas the other, as far as it goes, takes away obligation, and all deſert of blame and puniſhment intirely.</p>
            <p>THESE two kinds of inability, as I hinted, have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly been diſtinguiſhed, by calling one a natural, the other a moral inability. Which diſtinction may be brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtated thus. Moral inability conſiſts only in the want of a heart, or diſpoſition, or will, to do a thing. Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inability on the other hand, conſiſts in, or ariſes from, want of underſtanding, bodily ſtrength, opportunity; or, <hi>whatever may prevent,</hi> our doing a thing, when we are willing, and ſtrongly enough diſpoſed and inclin'd to do it. Or, in fewer words, thus: whatever a man could not do, <hi>if he would,</hi> he is under a natural inability of doing; but when all the reaſon one <hi>can't</hi> do a thing, is becauſe he has not <hi>a mind</hi> to, the inability is only of a moral nature.</p>
            <p>THIS diſtinction takes place, equally with regard to evil actions, and good ones. Thus, for inſtance, the divine being <hi>cannot</hi> do evil; not becauſe he wants opportunity, or underſtanding, or ſtrength, to do, with infinite eaſe, whatever he pleaſes; but only becauſe he is not, and it's impoſſible he ſhould be, inclined to do iniquity. He is ſo infinitely &amp; immutably holy, wiſe, juſt, and good; that it is not poſſible he ſhould ever <hi>pleaſe</hi> to act otherways, than in the moſt holy, righteous, and beſt manner. Hence, though we read that, "with God <hi>all things</hi> are poſſible," and that he can do <hi>every</hi> thing; yet alſewhere we are told,
<q>he cannot <hi>deny himſelf</hi>; and that it is impoſſible, for God to <hi>lie.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>ON the other hand, ſatan is incapable of doing right, or of behaving virtuouſly, in the leaſt inſtance or degree. But not becauſe he wants natural abilities; for undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011467_0010_0F832F3C1D77EE18"/>
in that reſpect, he is far ſuperior to many that are truly virtuous. His being incapable of any thing but infernal wickedneſs, is altogether owing to his being of ſuch an infernal diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>AND it is not uncommon, to ſpeak of incapacity in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, both as to doing good and doing evil, in this two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold ſignification. Some perſons we ſay are incapable of doing <hi>a mean thing.</hi> Not that we think it is above their <hi>natural</hi> capacity; but it is beneath them; they abhor, or they would ſcorn to do it. Others are incapable of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts of villany, not through any want of good will enough that way. They only want a convenient oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, or ſufficient ingenuity.—And juſt ſo it is in regard to doing good. Some have it not in the power of their hands; others have no heart to it. One is of a truly gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſpirit, and nothing but his own poverty, keeps him from being what Job was, a father to the poor, the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and him that has none to help him. Another is rich, and might be a great benefactor and bleſſing to all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round him; but he has no heart to deviſe liberal things. He <hi>can't</hi> be free and open handed; it isn't in him to be ſo. He is <hi>deaf</hi> to the cries of the poor, <hi>blind</hi> to their wants, &amp; <hi>dead</hi> to all the generous feelings of humanity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion.</p>
            <p>SOME are ſo feeble and infirm, that they can do ſcarce any bodily labour; though they are extremely free and willing to lay themſelves out to the utmoſt that their ſtrength will bear, and often go beyond it. Others are ſtrong and healthy enough, and might get a good living, and be uſeful members of ſociety; but ſuch is their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible lazineſs, that their hands refuſe to labour, and they can hardly get them out of their boſoms. Some are effectually kept from ſhining, or being very uſeful, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny public ſphere in church or ſtate, through the weakneſs of their heads: others, as effectually, by the badneſs of their hearts. Some are incapable of being taught by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of mere natural dulneſs: others only becauſe they are
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011467_0011_0F832F3CF75B3BF0"/>
of an unreachable ſpirit, and full of ſelf-conceit. Some are blind for want of eyes; but it is an old proverb, that none are more blind, than thoſe who <hi>won't</hi> ſee.</p>
            <p>THESE examples, are ſufficient to illuſtrate the diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I am inſiſting on, and to make it evident, that by <hi>incapable,</hi> we often mean ſomething very different from want of natural capacity. We may alſo perceive from theſe inſtances, that there is a real neceſſity for uſing ſuch words as, <hi>unable, incapable can't,</hi> &amp;c. in this diverſity of ſignification, in which we ſee they are uſed, in common ſpeech, as well as in the ſcriptures. For whenever any thing, whether in ourſelves or without us, is really ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely inconſiſtent with our doing a thing, we have no way fully and ſtrongly enough to expreſs that inconſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, but by ſaying we are <hi>unable,</hi> we <hi>cannot,</hi> it is <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible</hi>; or uſing ſome word of like import. And now it is certain that want of a heart, or inclination to do a thing, may be, and is, as inconſiſtent with our doing it, as any thing elſe could be. Covetuouſneſs is as inconſiſtent with liberality as poverty is, and may as effectually hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a man from doing deeds of charity. Indolence is as inconſiſtent with induſtry, as bodily weakneſs and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is. The want of an upright heart and a public ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is as inconſiſtent with the character of a good ruler, as the want of wiſdom and underſtanding. And the want of all principles of virtue, muſt be as inconſiſtent with acting virtuouſly, as even the want of thoſe intellectual fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, which are neceſſary to moral agency. And ſo on the other hand, as to doing evil things. There is no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of doing them, that is, knowingly, deſignedly, and as moral agents, without an evil diſpoſition. Our free and moral actions, are, and muſt be, as invariably guided and dictated by our own minds, as they are limited and bounded, by our natural power. That is, every one muſt act his own nature, and choice; otherways he don't act himſelf; <hi>he</hi> is not the agent. And if, when we would
<pb facs="unknown:011467_0012_0F832F3E1B0BD400"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
expreſs this ſort of neceſſity, we ſhould not uſe the ſame phraſes as are made uſe of in caſes of natural neceſſity-but for fear of a miſunderſtanding, ſhould carefully avoid ſaying a man <hi>cannot,</hi> when ever we mean only that he had not ſuch a heart as is neceſſary, and only ſay that he <hi>will not,</hi> in all ſuch caſes; our language would often ſound odd, being out of common cuſtom, which governs the propriety of words; and not only ſo, but it would not be ſufficiently expreſſive. Should we be afraid to ſay, it is <hi>impoſſible</hi> for a man to love God, or come to Chriſt, while his heart is altogether, wicked, and full of enmity againſt God and Chriſt; people would be ready to think we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined this might ſometimes happen, and that there was no real impoſſibility in it of any kind. Whereas there is as real, and as abſolute an impoſſibility in this caſe as in any ſuppoſable one whatever. To be more guarded therefore, than the ſcripture is, in this matter, would be to be unguarded. The apoſtle demands,
<q>
                  <hi>can</hi> the fig-tree, my brethren, bear olive-berries? either a vine figs?</q>
and the prophet,
<q>
                  <hi>can</hi> the Ethiopian change his ſkin? or the Leopard his ſpots? then may ye also do good, who are accuſtomed to do evil.</q>
And our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſays,
<q>a good tree <hi>cannot</hi> bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. A good man out of the good treaſure of the heart, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth good things. And an evil man out of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil treaſure, bringeth forth evil things.</q>
There is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and never failing a connection in this caſe, as any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural connection whatever. Which ought by no means to be diſſembled, but openly maintained. But then it is certainly of a quite different, and even a directly oppoſite nature, to all intents and purpoſes of moral agency. And it is of the laſt importance, in my apprehenſion, that this alſo ſhould be maintained, and manifeſted to every man's conſcience.</p>
            <p>BECAUSE a man <hi>muſt</hi> act according to his own heart or as he pleaſes; does this deſtroy his freedom! it is the very
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011467_0013_0F832F3E65469658"/>
thing in which all free agency conſiſts.—The pulſe <hi>can</hi> beat; and the limbs can move, in ſome bodily diſorders, or when one that is ſtronger than we takes hold of them; whether we will or no. But God does not conſider <hi>us</hi> as accountable, for ſuch actions as theſe. And we ſhould, not without reaſon, think it very hard, ſhould he blame or puniſh us for them. For an honeſt and good man's pulſe may beat, as irregularly as the worſt villain's in the world. Or his hands, in a convulſion, may ſtrike thoſe around him, in ſpite of all he can do to hold them ſtill. Or one may be carried by force, along with a gang of thieves, and be taken for one of them, though no man hates ſuch compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and actions as theirs, more heartily than he does. Such involuntary actions, every one ſees a man is not, &amp; ought not to be, accountable for. And the reaſon is, no bad inclination of ours, or want of a good one, is <hi>neceſſary</hi> in order to them. They are <hi>ſo free,</hi> as to be independant of <hi>us,</hi> and out of our power. If all our actions were like theſe; noways neceſſarily connected with our diſpoſition, and choice, and temper of mind; we could not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable creatures, or the ſubjects of moral government. If a good tree, could bring forth evil fruit, and a corrupt tree good fruit: if a good man, out of the good treaſure of his heart, could bring forth evil things, and an evil man out of the evil treaſure, good things; the tree could never be known-by its fruit. It could never be known by a man's actions, any thing what his heart was. So that, if they were dealt with according to their works, the moſt upright and well diſpoſed, would be as liable to be puniſhed; and the moſt ill-natured and ill-diſpoſed, as likely to be rewarded, as the contrary. Whence all moral government muſt be at an end.</p>
            <p>CERTAINLY, if we are juſtly accountable, rewardable or puniſhable, for any actions; if any actions are, or can be, properly <hi>our own,</hi> it muſt be ſuch as are dictated by ourſelves, and which <hi>can't</hi> take place without <hi>our</hi> own conſent. An inability, therefore, to act otherways than
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011467_0014_0F832F3F1E861640"/>
agreeably to our minds, is only an inability to act other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways than as free agents. And that neceſſity which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes from the temper and choice af the agent himſelf, and that which is againſt his choice and his very nature, are ſo far from coming to the ſame thing at laſt, that they are directly contrary one to the other, as to all the purpoſes of morality: freedom, accountableneſs, and deſert of praiſe, or blame, reward or puniſhment.</p>
            <p>AND this is agreable to the ſenſe of all mankind, in all common caſes. A man's heart being fully ſet in him to do evil, does not render his evil actions the leſs cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, in the judgment of common ſenſe, but the more ſo: Nor does the ſtrength of a virtuous diſpoſition, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a good action the <hi>leſs,</hi> but the <hi>more</hi> amiable, and worthy of praiſe. Does any one look upon the Divine Being, as leſs excellent and glorious, for being ſo infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unchangeably holy in his nature, that he
<q>cannot be tempted with evil,</q>
or act otherwiſe, than in the moſt holy and perfect manner? Does any one look upon the devil, as leſs ſinful and to blame, becauſe he is of ſuch a deviliſh diſpoſition, ſo full of cauſeleſs ſpite and malice, againſt God and man, as to be incapable of any thing, but the moſt horrid wickedneſs?—And as to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: Who is there that does not make a difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him that is incapable of a baſe action, only by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the virtuouſneſs of his temper, having all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural talents, requiſite for the moſt conſummate villany; and him that is incapable of being the worſt of villains, for no other reaſon, than only becauſe he don't know how? Does any one think, that only the want of a will to work, excuſes a man from it juſt as much as bodily infirmity does? Or, do we any of us, ever imagine, that the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous miſer, who with all his uſeleſs hoards, has no heart to give a penny to the poor, is for that reaſon, equally excuſable from deeds of charity, as he who has nothing to give?</p>
            <p>WE certainly, always make a diſtinction, betwixt want
<pb facs="unknown:011467_0015_0F832F3FF2138CB0"/>
of natural abilities to do good, and the want of a heart; looking upon the one as a <hi>good</hi> excuſe, the other as <hi>no</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe <hi>at all,</hi> but rather as that in which all wickedneſs radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally conſiſts. A natural fool, no one blames, for acting like a fool: But
<q>to him that knoweth to do good, and doth it not; to him it is ſin,</q>
in the ſenſe of all mankind, as well as in God's account.
<q>If there be firſt a <hi>willing mind,</hi>
               </q>
we always ſuppoſe it ought to be
<q>accepted, according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.</q>
But the want of a willing mind, or not being a mind to do well, is univerſally conſidered as a crime, and not as an excuſe. Nothing is more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to us, than to diſtinguiſh in this manner. Nor can any man of common ſenſe, help judging thus.</p>
            <p>NOW, this diſtinction is as applicable to the caſe before us, as it is to any other caſe. Some may be unable to comply with the goſpel, through the want of thoſe powers of mind, or thoſe bodily organs, or thoſe means of grace, without which it is impoſſible to underſtand the character of Chriſt, or the way of ſalvation, let their hearts be ever ſo good. In either of which caſes, the inability is of the natural kind. Others, may have all the outward means, and all the natural facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which are neceſſary in order to a right underſtanding of the goſpel; and yet, through the evil temper of their minds, they may be wholly averſe to it, and wholly blind to the glory of it. They may be diſpoſed, to make light of all its propoſals and invitations, and to treat every thing relating to religion and another world, with the utmoſt neglect and indifference. Or if their fears of "the wrath to come," are by any means awakened, and they are made with much ſolicitude, to enquire
<q>what they ſhall do to be ſaved;</q>
ſtill, they may be utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inclined to ſubmit to the righteouſneſs, or the grace of God, as revealed in the Goſpel. They may be ſtill, ſuch
<q>children of the devil, and enemies of all righteouſneſs, as to be irreconcilably averſe to all the right ways of the Lord.</q>
They may have
<q>ſuch an evil heart of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:011467_0016_0F832F40A4563348"/>
to depart from the living God,</q>
as is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inconſiſtent with conſenting to the covenant of grace, or "believing to the ſaving of the ſoul." Now, when this is the caſe, the inability the ſinner is under, is only of a moral nature. We may paſs on now to the</p>
            <p n="2">II. HEAD, viz. To ſhow that all who are not the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this ſpecial and effectual grace of God, muſt certainly be unable, in one or the other of theſe ſenſes, to come to Chriſt, or comply with the goſpel.</p>
            <p>THOSE, many of them at leaſt, who diſlike the diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion now explained, and ſome who ſeem in a ſort to admit it, ſuppoſe all men have, and muſt have, every kind of ability to do their duty, and to obtain ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But, I apprehend, it will be very eaſy to make appear, that this certainly is not the caſe. A variety of ſcripture arguments, and a multitude of texts, might be adduced here, were they needed. But that <hi>all</hi> have not, <hi>both</hi> the forementioned kinds of ability to comply with the goſpel, either of themſelves, or by the help of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon grace, is as evident as any thing needs to be, meerly from the fact, that many do not do it, but actually live and die in impenitence and unbelief. By common grace is meant, that grace which is given to ſinners in general, thoſe that are not ſaved, as well as thoſe that are. They who believe all, are in every ſenſe, able to work out their own ſalvation, through the goſpel, would not be thought to fruſtrate the grace of God. They do not ſuppoſe ſinners are able to do this <hi>of themſelves,</hi> but that ſome divine aſſiſtance, ſome working of God in them, both to will and to do, is really neceſſary in the caſe. But then they ſuppoſe, all this needed grace, whatever it be, is given to ſinners without exception; and hereby they account for God's commanding all men every where, to repent and believe the goſpel. "I grant, indeed," ſays an ingenious arminian writer, <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Stebbing, on the opperations of the ſpirit.</note>
               <q>that by reaſon of original ſin, we are utterly diſabled for the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011467_0017_0F832F415A2373B8"/>
of the condition, without new grace from God. But I ſay then, that he gives ſuch grace to all of us, by which the performance of the condition is truly poſſible, and upon this ground he doth and may moſt righteouſly require it.</q>
Here by the way, it is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of particular remark, what notions many are obliged to entertain of divine grace, in order not to reflect upon the divine juſtice. To require <hi>perfect holineſs</hi> of creatures ſo enfeebled and depraved as we are, they ſuppoſe would be evidently one of the moſt <hi>unreaſonable</hi> things in the world. Therefore God has been <hi>graciouſly</hi> pleaſed to ſend his Son to obey and die in our room, that we might not be "under the law but under grace." But then the covenant of <hi>grace,</hi> is not mild and gracious enough to be quite ſtrictly juſt; becauſe by reaſon of original ſin, we are utterly diſabled for the performance of the condition upon which ſalvation is ſuſpended ſtill. To remedy the unreaſonableneſs of this, new <hi>grace</hi> from God is required. Accordingly "he giveth <hi>more</hi> grace."
<q>He gives ſuch grace to all of us, whereby the performance of the condition, is truly poſſible; and upon this ground he doth and may moſt righteouſly require it!</q>
Thus, not only the obedience and death of Chriſt, but likewiſe all the grace of the Holy Ghoſt which is neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is found no more than barely ſufficient to ſcreen the ways of God to men, from the juſt imputation of unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs, and unrighteouſneſs. It is certainly difficult to conceive, how any man who really views things in this light, however much he may talk of free grace, can ever feel himſelf any more obliged and indebted to God, than if he had only dealt with us in a righteous manner from firſt to laſt, never requiring more of us than we were able to do, and ſo no occaſſion or room had been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for any grace in the affair. And yet this view of the matter, is really as friendly to the grace of God, as any conceivable one which proceeds upon the principle, that
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011467_0018_0F832F421849D988"/>
nothing more can be juſtly required of us, than we have a moral as well as natural power to do.</p>
            <p>BUT what I had more eſpecially in view here, was to enquire how it comes to paſs that any in fact do not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the goſpel, if that grace is given to every one which is ſufficient, in all reſpects, to enable him to do it. If we want the faculties of body or mind, or the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity and means, which are neceſſary in order to obtain the knowledge of the truth, thoſe difficulties muſt be removed: And if we want a heart to take pains to know the truth, or to love and embrace it when diſcovered, that difficulty alſo muſt be removed, or elſe we are not, in every ſenſe, <hi>enabled.</hi> It is not, in all reſpects, truly poſſible that a ſinner ſhould come to Chriſt, till every thing that is inconſiſtent with his coming is removed out of the way. It is truly impoſſible that any one ſhould cordially embrace the goſpel, ſo long as he has not ſuch an heart in him; though it would be impoſſible in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry different reſpect, if he had not external light, or natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral powers ſufficient. And now, if God gave that grace to all of us, whereby we were enabled in <hi>both</hi> theſe ſenſes, to comply with the goſpel, the infallible conſequence muſt be, that we ſhould all of us actually do it. To ſay that a man has both natural and moral ability to do a thing, is the ſame as to ſay that nothing in nature is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in order to his doing of it but only his own good will, <hi>nor that neither.</hi> Or, that he both could do it if he would, and is ſufficiently willing to. And whenever this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be the caſe, I believe it is not very likely, the thing will, after all, not be done. If in the inſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, it is really thus; if ſinners not only could come to Chriſt if they would, but they have likewiſe all that willingneſs of mind, which is neceſſary in order to their actually coming, what in the univerſe can ever be aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the reaſon why in fact they do not? This muſt certainly be an event, abſolutely without any cauſe.</p>
            <p>THE truth is, when people puzzle themſelves upon
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011467_0019_0F832F42DBB32408"/>
this ſubject, and inſiſt we are not accountable, and can't be blamed, any further than we have a moral as well as natural power to do otherways than we do, what their minds run upon, is only <hi>natural</hi> power after all. They may ſay they know what we mean by moral power, viz. that diſpoſition to do a thing which is neceſſary in order to our doing it; and they mean the ſame. But however, when they get into the diſpute, they get bewildered, and loſe ſight of the diſtinction. <hi>They</hi> don't ſuppoſe an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent ſinner, going on ſtill in his treſpaſſes, has a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, actual</hi> diſpoſition, and a ſufficiently ſtrong one, to hearken to, and obey the goſpel. But ſomething like this ſeems to be in the bottom of their minds, viz. that he muſt be <hi>able</hi> to be diſpoſed; or he muſt have ſuch a diſpoſiton as <hi>would</hi> be ſufficient, if he was diſpoſed to make a good uſe of it. Now this is only to uſe the word <hi>diſpoſition</hi> improperly, &amp; to conceive of it as a mere natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral power; a price in our hands, which may be uſed well or ill, and which will turn to our benefit or condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, accordingly as we are diſpoſed to improve it. The diſpoſition they think of, is not in the leaſt degree vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, nor any ways neceſſarily connected with virtuous conduct. But it may lie ſtill, or go wrong, and will do ſo, unleſs a man is diſpos'd and exerts himſelf, to make it act and keep it right. The ſinner is not helped out of his difficulties in the leaſt, by having ſuch a diſpoſition as this. Yea, ſhould we go further, and ſay, the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent ſinner might have a heart to embrace the goſpel, <hi>if</hi> he would take proper pains in order to it; and he might do this, <hi>if</hi> he was ſo diſpoſed; and he might be ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed <hi>if</hi> he would try; and he could try <hi>if</hi> he had a mind to. Yet, IF after all, he <hi>has not</hi> amind to try, to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, to take any proper pains, to get a heart, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the goſpel, or to do any thing that is good; he is ſtill in as bad a ſituation as any body ſuppoſes him to be in. There is no more hope of his coming to good, ſo long as this is the caſe with him, no more poſſibility of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:011467_0020_0F832F439663CBD8"/>
it; nor do we ſay any thing more in his favour, than if we had only ſaid as the ſcripture does of the fool,
<q>that there is a price in his hand to get wiſdom, but he has <hi>no heart</hi> to it.</q>
Puſhing the ſinner's moral depravity and impotence back in this manner, may get it out of the ſight of thoſe who can't ſee above two or three ſteps: But this is all the good it can do. There is ſtill a defect in him <hi>ſome where</hi>; and ſuch a one as will prove his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ruin, unleſs removed by ſuch grace as he has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet experienced.</p>
            <p>IT muſt forever hold true and certain, that if ſinners do not come to Chriſt, it is either becauſe they could not if they <hi>would</hi>; or elſe becauſe, on the whole, they are not willing to. And if, in the room of coming to Chriſt, we ſhould ſubſtitute ſome lower and preliminary conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of grace and ſalvation, it would be juſt the ſame caſe. Suppoſe it were uſing means, praying and ſeeking in the moſt engaged manner the unregenerate ſometimes do; all do not come up to this; and the reaſon certainly is, they are under a natural, or elſe a moral inability of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. Either they could not ſeek in this manner, if they would, or elſe they are not inclined to, but their diſpoſition is to employ their time and thoughts about other things. So that bringing down the conditions of the goſpel lower, in conſideration of the depravity of men; or ſuppoſing common grace, whereby all are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to come up higher than they could of themſelves, removes no difficulties, at leaſt not thoſe deſign'd to be removed, unleſs the way of life is ſuppoſed to be level to the inclinations of all men; or that all are in fact made willing, and actually are ſaved.</p>
            <p>ON the whole, I think the <hi>principle,</hi> that God can in juſtice require of his creatures, only what he gives them a moral as well as natural power to do, muſt be given up. Otherways we are reduced to a neceſſity of ſuppoſing, all the blame, if any are loſt, muſt lie entirely on God, and not on them. And as to thoſe who are ſaved, they can
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:011467_0021_0F832F44542E84E8"/>
have nothing to ſay in his praiſe, but only that he has been barely juſt to them. That having given his Son to obey and die, to deliver them from his law, which was an infinitely unreaſonable one, for fallen creatures to be under; and having given his ſpirit to enable them to come up to the otherways impoſſible terms of the goſpel, he has on the whole, dealt not unrighteouſly by them. If therefore we think, there is any way to vindicate the righteouſneſs of God in the damnation of any; or that any thing can fairly be ſaid to the praiſe of the glory of his grace, in the ſalvation of them that are ſaved, we muſt ſuppoſe he is not obliged in juſtice to give all of us both the kinds of ability that have been ſpoken of. And if we believe that any in fact do not obtain ſalvation, we muſt conclude they <hi>are not</hi> in both theſe ſenſes, enabled to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it. Which was all I undertook to prove under this ſecond head. The</p>
            <p>III. THING propoſed was, to conſider the <hi>moral</hi> ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability of ſinners in this matter.</p>
            <p>THERE is not ſo much need of labouring to confirm this, that unregenerate ſinners have not ſuch an heart in them, as is neceſſary in order to a compliance with the goſpel; becauſe proving the preceeding and ſubſequent propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, will infer the truth of this. If there is certainly an incapacity of the natural <hi>or</hi> moral kind, as has now been ſhewn; and if there is certainly no <hi>natural</hi> incapacity, as I am to make appear under the next head; then certainly there muſt be a <hi>moral</hi> one. Beſides, I have time to treat this head but very conciſely, conſidering the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of it.</p>
            <p>IT may be proper to be obſerved here, that the diſincli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of ſinners, as to ſome things which are pre-requiſite to a compliance with the goſpel, is different in different perſons. Though even this difference, I ſuppoſe, is ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to divine grace, or to more's being done for one than for another.</p>
            <p>IN the <hi>openly vicious</hi> and <hi>immoral</hi> ſinner, there is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011467_0022_0F832F45463B9C90"/>
inclination to perſiſt in his diſſolute and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral practices. And there is reaſon to conclude, that <hi>none</hi> of this character would ever reform, and that <hi>all</hi> would <hi>be</hi> of this character, if left to their own heart's luſts, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any divine reſtraints.</p>
            <p>IN <hi>ſecure</hi> and <hi>unawakened</hi> ſinners, there is no diſpoſition to attend to the concerns of their ſouls, and ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſtate they are in, or to make any ſollicitous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry about the way of ſalvation. They
<q>make light of theſe things, and go their way, one to his farm, and another to his marchandiſe.</q>
And ſuch is their attachment to the vanities of time, and their averſion to attend to things of another world, that there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think, any one of this character, would ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſerious, thoughtful, and engaged about his eternal well-being, if left intirely to himſelf.</p>
            <p>IN the <hi>awakened</hi> ſinner, though earneſt in his enquiries, there is ſtill an utter want of an honeſt openeſs of mind, to admit a conviction of the truth.
<q>He that doth evil hateth the light, neither cometh he to the light, leſt his deeds ſhould be reproved.</q>
He whoſe
<q>inward parts are very wickedneſs,</q>
will always hate to ſee, and, if he can poſſibly help it, never will believe what he really is. Hence awakened ſinners very often, never do, and if left to themſelves none of them ever would, "know the plague of their own hearts." While they think they are doing all in their power to increaſe their convictions, they are all the while inwardly ſtriving with all their might, againſt conviction, and trying to find ſome plauſible ground to think well of themſelves, and to eſtabliſh a righteouſneſs of their own. Nor will they ever be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble how "deceitful and deſperately wicked" their hearts are, and how hopeleſs their caſe is, in themſelves, till a conviction of it is forced upon them by the moſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing and irreſiſtable evidence.</p>
            <p>AND even in the <hi>convinced</hi> ſinner, whoſe mouth is moſt effectually ſtopped, who is forced to ſee that ſin is alive
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011467_0023_0F832F45DDBE45E8"/>
and has full dominion over him, and that he is indeed dead; in him who has the fulleſt conviction of every ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary truth, that any unrenew'd ſinner ever had; there is ſtill, if nothing further is done for him, no diſpoſition heartily to approve of the law, or comply with the goſpel; no diſpoſition to repent truly of any of his tranſgreſſions, or receive and be dependent on Chriſt alone for pardon and ſalvation; no genuine deſire to be ſaved from <hi>ſin,</hi> or to be ſaved from wrath in that way, in which God's juſtice can be vindicated, or his grace exalted. But after all his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, there remains ſtill in his heart, a moſt fix'd, inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate, and unconquerable oppoſition to all theſe things. Nor will he ever be cordially reconciled to God, by the mere force of truth in his conſcience, any more than the wicked will be at the day of judgment, or the damned in hell.</p>
            <p>THAT no light, or conviction of the underſtanding, which the natural man is capable of receiving, can be ſufficient to draw, or drive, him into a true compliance with the goſpel, is very evident from what is ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the neceſſity of regeneration. When Nicodemus came to Chriſt, wanting information about the way of life, our Saviour ſoon let him know that mere inſtruction, even by a teacher come from God, was not all that was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Yea, that a man could <hi>receive</hi> no inſtruction, about the kingdom of heaven, to any ſaving purpoſe, unleſs ſomething elſe was done for him firſt. See John iii. 3.
<q>Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto him, verily, verily I ſay unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the kingdom of God.</q>
And again, to explain the matter further, ver 5.
<q>Except a man be born of — the ſpirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</q>
The neceſſity of ſuch a change as is meant by being born again, or born of the ſpirit, turns upon the truth of man's being by nature, under a total moral depravity. Accordingly, our Saviour immediately adds,
<q>That which is born of the fleſh is fleſh; and that which is
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:011467_0024_0F832F46949C5248"/>
born of the ſpirit, is ſpirit.</q>
That is, a man has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing truly ſpiritual or, holy, in him by the firſt birth; but every thing of this kind, comes by the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt. Agreably to this, the apoſtle Paul ſays, Rom. vii. 18. "I know that in me, (that is in my fleſh; in my nature as far as it is unrenewed, unſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and as it was by the firſt birth) there dwelleth no good thing." And in Rom. viii. 7. he ſays,
<q>The carnal mind,</q>
the mind we have as born of the fleſh,
<q>is enmity againſt God; for it is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</q>
He adds,
<q>So then, they that are <hi>in the fleſh</hi>; cannot pleaſe God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS is the reaſon we <hi>muſt be born again.</hi> If there was any thing ſpiritual in us, as born of the fleſh, there would be no neceſſity of this ſecond birth. If we were not by nature <hi>dead</hi> in treſpaſſes and ſins, there would be no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for our being <hi>quickened,</hi> by divine power and grace. If ſinners were inclined at all to that which is good, they would not need to be <hi>created</hi> unto good works. If man had not <hi>wholly</hi> loſt the divine likeneſs, there would be no need of being <hi>created</hi> again
<q>after God, in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and true holineſs.</q>
If the
<q>heart of the ſons of men</q>
was not altogether depraved, to the very bottom of it, there would be no neceſſity of the old "heart's being taken away, and a <hi>new</hi> one given." If men's alienation of affection from God, did not ariſe from <hi>unlikeneſs</hi> to him, but only from ignorance and miſappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion about him, no <hi>change</hi> of nature would be at all neceſſary. Mere light in the head, mere conviction of the underſtanding, would then produce a cordial reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation. Yea, if a man has any degree of righteouſneſs and true holineſs, nothing but convictions can be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in order to his complying with the covenant of grace, and entering into the kingdom of God. He would no ſooner be convinced of the holineſs and righteouſneſs of God, but he would feel his heart drawn forth in love to him. He would no ſooner be convinced that the law
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:011467_0025_0F832F476DDCF398"/>
was holy, juſt and good, but he would be pleaſed with it, and loathe himſelf for all his tranſgreſſions of it. He would no ſooner be convinced of the unparrallel'd zeal which Chriſt hath ſhewn in the cauſe of righteouſneſs, and how he has magnified the law and made it honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but he would be charmed with him, and ſee him to be
<q>the chiefeſt among ten thouſand, and altogether lovely.</q>
He would no ſooner be convinced, of the holy tendency of all his doctrines and all his laws, but he would cordially embrace, and chearfully obey them. He would no ſooner underſtand, that his deſign was to ſave his people from their <hi>ſins,</hi> but he would receive him, with all joy and thankfulneſs, as <hi>his</hi> Saviour and Lord.</p>
            <p>BUT, if the hearts of men are totally depraved, deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of righteouſneſs and true holineſs entirely, the caſe will be quite otherways. A holy God, a holy law, a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Saviour, a holy goſpel, will not ſurely, then appear love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their eyes, but the contrary. Nor will a clearer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and conviction of what they really are, excite complacence and ſatisfaction in them, but the greater a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and dread. They cannot, in that caſe, be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially united to Chriſt, until <hi>his</hi> character or <hi>their's,</hi> is eſſentially changed. They can not be <hi>drawn</hi> to him, unleſs by force, and againſt their wills, till either <hi>he</hi> ceaſes to be what he is, or <hi>they</hi> are made new creatures. For
<q>an unjuſt man is an abomination to the juſt; and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked.</q>
And,
<q>what fellowſhip hath righteouſneſs with unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs? And what communion hath light with dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? And what concord hath Chriſt with Belial?</q>
            </p>
            <p>CAN a man whoſe heart is wholly corrupt, and unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, chuſe the holy Jeſus for his Lord and Saviour, and cordially embrace the pure and holy doctrines and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of his goſpel? Can one who is really and at heart, wholly in love with the ſervice of Satan, inliſt, with any ſincerity, into the ſervice of Chriſt, all whoſe work and buſineſs is,
<q>to deſtroy the works of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil?</q>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:011467_0026_0F832F4830CF8778"/>
Can one who is all the while
<q>an enemy in his mind to God,</q>
yea, whoſe
<q>mind is enmity itſelf againſt God,</q>
be delighted with the character and ways of his well-beloved Son, who is
<q>the brightneſs of the Father's glory, and the very image of his perſon?</q>
Can one who
<q>is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be,</q>
be ſubject to the Mediator, or ſuited with his conduct in being obedient even unto death, to condemn ſin and do honor to the divine law? Can one who is an enemy to all righteouſneſs, be pleaſed with Chriſt in this view of his character, pleaſed with him, "for his righteouſneſs ſake," and for the zeal he has ſhewn to "magnify the law and make it honorable?"</p>
            <p>THIS is the reaſon the Father is well pleaſed in him as Mediator. And "all that come unto God by him," muſt be pleaſed with him in this view alſo. There can be no true reconciliation between God and man, unleſs both parties acquieſce, and are ſuited with what the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator has done; and that conſidered in the ſame point of light. God is well pleaſed, indeed, with the love Chriſt has ſhown for loſt men. For the Father was always as benevolently diſpos'd towards this fallen world, as the Son was. But yet had he not as Mediator, ſhown a proper regard to truth and righteouſneſs; had he not "condemned the ſin of men," and
<q>given to God the glory that was due unto his name,</q>
the holy Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the world could not have acquiſced in his media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<q>The Lord was well pleaſed for his righteouſneſs ſake.</q>
And if we are not pleaſed with him in <hi>this</hi> view, but merely for the ſake of his <hi>kindneſs</hi> and <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will</hi> to men, we do not come into his plan of reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and of peace. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>If that view of the amiableneſs of Chriſt, and that well pleaſedneſs with his mediation, which is implied in a compliance with the goſpel, had nothing more in it than only ſeeing it to be a beautiful thing in him to feel ſo much interreſted in <hi>our</hi> welfare, and willing to do and ſuffer ſo much to ſave <hi>us</hi> from miſery and ruin; then indeed, no change of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the moſt depraved creature would be neceſſary in order to it. We may be as wholly ſelfiſh and regardleſs of God's glory as any ſinner over was, and yet be greatly charmed with the meditation of Chriſt, view'd only in the favourable aſpect it has upon our intereſt. And, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, thouſands have been fatally deceiv'd in this manner. Taking this for a diſcovery of "the gory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt," and the effects of it for converſion and ſanctification. For ſuch a view of Chriſt and of God through him, will, under certain circumſtances, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a ſort of repentance, love and obedience, in one who was, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to be, intirely void of real holineſs. Let a ſinner only have an impreſſive ſenſe of the dreadfulneſs of damnation, and of his danger of it, and in the midſt of this have the love of Chriſt, and what he has done &amp; ſuffered for ſinners, come ſuddenly into his mind, in a manner that makes him believe, or at leaſt ſtrongly hope, he is one of the happy number for whom Chriſt laid down his life; and is it poſſible but that be ſhould be filled with comfort and joy, and have his affections greatly drawn forth towards ſuch a kind and almighty Saviour? And when lie comes now to view God in Chriſt as his reconciled God and father he will naturally feel quite otherways affected towards him too. When he believes God has loved him with an everlaſting love, and elected him from eternity to be a veſſel of mercy and an heir of glory; his enmity againſt him will hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on naturally ſubſide; he will neceſſarily be aſhamed and grieved that he has had ſuch unworthy thoughts of him, and has behaved ſo unſuitably towards him. And ſuch an apprehenſion of his new ſtate, and of God's great goodneſs, may produce a laſting alteration in his life. He may be very zealous in religion; and poſſibly very regular in his morals likewiſe Here then, is faith, repentance, love, and new obedience, without the leaſt occaſion for any conformity to God in true holineſs from firſt to laſt. Such things as theſe are the natural growth of the human heart under ſuch rain and ſunſhine. There is no need of any alteration in the ſoil, or of any foreign ſeed ſown in it.</p>
                  <p>THIS may be more clearly conceived, by the help of a ſimilitude. Let us then, ſuppoſe a king that is ſtrictly juſt in his adminiſtration; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding, on very ſevere penalties, all unrighteouſneſs among his ſubjects, and very thorough in ſeeing that juſtice is duly executed on all offenders. A number of his ſubjects, who are viciouſly inclind, are uneaſy under ſuch reſtraints, and grow diſaffecteed to their ſovereign, and at length form a conſpiracy to dethrone him. But before they are quite ripe for execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, their plot is happily diſcovered. They are taken and brought to judgment; found guilty, and condemn'd to die. Their hatred againſt their prince is hereby greatly increaſed. One of them, however, is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly dejected in ſpirit, at the thoughts of his approaching execution. For ſome time he remains in priſon with the reſt, in fearful expectation that every day may be his laſt. But in the midſt of his greateſt anxiety, a meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at laſt arrives with a gracious pardon. He is delivered from priſon and from death. Yea, his offended ſovereign has ſet his heart ſo peculiarly upon him, that inſtead of having him executed with his fellow criminals, he is determined to make him a particular favourite at court, and raiſe him to honor and wealth, far exceeding his former condition before he became a rebel and a traitor. How great is the ſurpriſe! how inſupportably the joy, upon hearing all this! the wretch's enmity and hatred is quite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome. Eſpecially if he now underſtands that the king had always a particular kindneſs for <hi>him,</hi> and never deſign'd any penal laws ſhould be executed upon him, let him do what he would. He is fill'd with the moſt admiring ſentiments of his injured gracious ſovereign, and loves him above all men in the world. But hardly dares to look up to him, he is ſo aſhamed of his former temper towards him, and the black deſign he had meditated againſt his crown and life. All this does not ſuppoſe any alteration in the rebels real character. All this may be, and undoubtedly will be, though his vicious diſpoſition, which firſt gave riſe to his diſaffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his prince, ſtill remains in its full ſtrength. There is no need of his becoming a new man, a friend to righteouſneſs and an enemy to ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, in order to his becoming in this manner, a warm friend to his royal <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> and benefactor, conſidered merely as ſuch. He may be ſo all his days; may be one of the foremoſt in his commendation at leaſt in extolling the great things he has done for him; and he may behave excellently well when under the kings eye, or when he expects, he will hear of it, with a view to pleaſe him, and yet be at heart as unrighteous a creature as ever he was, even to his dying day.</p>
                  <p>Now ſuch a kind of reconciliation to <hi>God,</hi> will naturally take place in a ſinner, if he is only effectually terrified with the thoughts of "dwelling with devouting fire, and inhabiting everlaſting burnings;" and then gets a hope of God's love. There is no need of being born again, or ever hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing of the moral likeneſs of God, in order to it. Yea, there is no need of conviction, in order to ſuch a converſion as this. I mean a conviction of the equitableneſs and moral fitneſs of the divine adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Light, concerning the holineſs and juſtice, wiſdom or general good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, is not what produces ſuch a change as this; nor is it any ways neceſſary in order to it. Accordingly perſons of this kind of piety, have no great concern to know what God is in himſelf, but only what he is to them. They have no notion of entering much into the nature and ends of his law, or of the goſpel, and ſeeing into the divine character and glory as thereby exhibited. Theſe are matters of empty ſpeculation with them; things which vital piety has nothing to do with. They know as much about God's general character; as much about the things the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt prayed that his eyes might be opened to behold; as much about "the things the angels deſire to look into," as ever they expect or want to.</p>
                  <p>THESE may perhaps not improperly be denominated antinomians; though they are divided into a variety of ſects and contending parties up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on particular queſtions, about the faith which is not founded in holineſs, but which is the foundation of every thing.</p>
                  <p>SOME ſtrenuouſly inſiſt, that no faith can adminiſter hope and comfort enough to make men truly good, ſhort of "a full perſuaſion and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of our <hi>own</hi> ſalvation." Or, a being well ſatisfied "of our recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God, and of our future enjoyment of everlaſting heavenly happineſs." To get this perſuaſion is the grand ſecret, or "myſtery of ſanctification." To <hi>give</hi> this perſuaſion without any evidence of it's truth, and even while it is ſuppoſed to be in fact not true, is the great work of the Holy Ghoſt, begetting "an inclination, and propenſity of heart, to the practice of holineſs."—Others, not ſo fond of myſtery, or not ſo well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding "the way of manufacturing truth without evidence," and of making a falſehood true, by the pains taken to believe it; chuſe rather to ſuppoſe, "the ſimple truth," or general report of the goſpel, beat ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually into a man's <hi>head,</hi> when "he is thoroughly pinched with the impoſſibility of hope, on every other ſide, will give ſuch a refreſhment to his mind," as will do the whole work. That
<q>many in all ages, only on hearing this, have become quite aſhamed of their former rebellion, have been led to love their ſovereign, and encouraged to do thoſe things which are well pleaſing in his ſight; and accordingly have known what it was to ſtand in his preſence, and have their joy made full in behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the light of his countenance.</q>
The faith that does all this, they would have a bare perſuaſion, or conviction in the underſtanding, of what is called the truth; leaving the heart to take care of itſelf. This, we are told, ſome call <hi>the faith of devils.</hi> But that
<q>however keen the intended reproach be, it can have weight with none but ſuch as are ſwayed by ſound inſtead of ſenſe. For, according to the ſcripture, the ſame truth which ſaves Chriſt's people torments the devil's. So we find them ſaying <hi>what have we to do with thee, Jeſus, thou ſon of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?</hi> they believe, they hate, and yet they tremble at that truth which Chriſt's people believe, love and find ſalvation in.</q>
The difference then, in the affections excited by a belief of the goſpel, in the minds of true believers and devils, ariſes intirely from the different circumſtances they are under, and not from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difference in their tempers. The devils hate to be tormented, and Chriſt's people love to be treated kindly and made happy. So the ſame belief of the ſame truth, which excites the hatred and horror of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, fills the latter with joy and love. This difference is not hard to diſcern; and is naturally enough accounted for. But how any one, who is not ſwayed by ſound inſtead of ſenſe, ſhould think of making more of this than only a circumſtantial difference, is not ſo eaſy to be conceived. A bare change of place and external treatment, would <hi>make</hi> devils of ſuch converts; and ſuch converts of devils, in a moment. They being after all eſſentially, exactly alike.</p>
                  <p>THIS way of affecting all the alteration wanted in wicked men, merely by notious in the head, however firmly credited, and whether true or falſe, whether called an appropriating faith, or a ſimple belief, or by whatever other name, muſt forever leave a change of nature quite out of the queſtion. Indeed it evidently proceeeds upon the ſuppoſition, that there is really no difference, between ſaints and ſinners, angels and devils, only they are treated differently, or ſome don't <hi>underſtand</hi> things ſo well as others.</p>

               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:011467_0027_0F832F48D85CB1C0"/>To conclude this head, and the preſent diſcourſe. If the moral depravity of unregenerate ſinners, was fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, it muſt undoubtedly appear that this alone is
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:011467_0028_0F832F499DF3DCA8"/>
ſufficient to account for all that is ſaid in the ſcripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their inability, and to make the grace of the Holy Ghoſt as neceſſary, as that makes it. If they have
<q>an evil
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:011467_0029_0F832F4A5CDDF808"/>
heart of unbelief,</q>
wholly inclined
<q>to depart from the living God,</q>
ſuch a heart will effectually and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<q>turn them aſide, ſo that <hi>they</hi> cannot deliver their
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:011467_0030_0F832F4B280F66D0"/>
ſoul.</q>
Nor would better natural abilities than they have, be of the leaſt ſervice to them. If ever they come to good, it muſt be by ſtrength that is under a better <hi>direction</hi> than their's is. Greatneſs of capacity has not the leaſt tendency to produce <hi>goodneſs,</hi> in one who is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſtitute of it. Sinners of the moſt exalted genius and ſtrength of mind, are certainly no more able to make themſelves new creatures than the very weakeſt are. And the reaſon of this is as obvious, as the fact is certain; viz. becauſe whatever ſtrength any one has, he always lays it out according to his own heart, and not contrary to it. Conſequently all the ſtrength of men and angels, yea even Omnipotence itſelf, if the ſinner had the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, would never make him good. Could he have divine power at his ſervice, according to his utmoſt wiſh, it would not be to change his heart, but to enable him to act it out without controul. If therefore, ſinners on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knew what hearts they have, this alone would bring them to diſpair of help from themſelves, let their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:011467_0031_0F832F4BD454D580"/>
powers be never ſo good, and make them ſee that if ever they are ſaved it will be no thanks to them. <note n="¶" place="bottom">Should we even ſuppoſe a ſelf determining power in the will, thoſe who are dead in ſin would not be able to help themſelves by it. For who is there to put ſuch a power into action the right way? <hi>they</hi> will not do it. And a ſelf determined determination, contrary to a man's heart, were ſuch a thing poſſible, would be no more thanks to him, than the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his heart changed by divine power. It can never be by <hi>their own power</hi> or holineſs, that they are firſt determined to that which is good, when, by the ſuppoſition, they <hi>have no</hi> holineſs, and all their power is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in oppoſition to it.</note>
            </p>
            <p>SINNERS inwardly imagine, if they were only dealt fairly with they ſhould do well enough. If they periſh, they think it will be owing to the fatal influence of ſome dark decree, or to God's requiring more of them than they <hi>can</hi> poſſibly do, let them exert themſelves never ſo faithfully. But he that imagines thus, knows not
<q>the plague of his own heart.</q>

               <q>
                  <bibl>JOHN VI. 44.</bibl>
                  <p>No man can come to me, except the Father which hath ſent me draw him.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE general obſervation raiſed from theſe words, was to this effect,</p>
            <p>THAT no man is able to comply with the goſpel of Chriſt, without the effectual grace of God.</p>
            <p>A principal thing I had in view, was to clear this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the common objection in men's minds againſt it, as if it repreſented the Moſt High, as being inſincere and unrighteous in his dealings with ſinners. Offering them ſalvation on terms he knows they cannot come up to; and then condemning and puniſhing them, for their non-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with ſuch impoſſible conditions. Accordingly, I undertook, in the firſt place, to explain and illuſtrate a diſtinction of two kinds of inability; and to ſhew that men are, not unfrequently, in common ſpeech, and ſcripture,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:011467_0033_0F832F4D684449E0"/>
ſaid to be incapable of actions which are their averſion, or which they have not an inclination to, as well as of things which they could not do if they were ſo diſpoſed. As likewiſe, that there is a real occaſion for uſing this and the like expreſſions, in ſuch a manner. There being, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, an abſolute impoſſibility of a man's acting other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways than agreeably to his own heart, as well as there is of his doing things which exceed his natural ſtrength.</p>
            <p>Secondly; I endeavoured to ſhew, that ſinners while they actually neglect the great ſalvation, are certainly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, in one or the other of theſe ſenſes, not to neglect it. That ſo long as they <hi>do not</hi> come to Chriſt, it muſt be true that they want, either ſuch natural ability, or elſe ſuch a heart, as is neceſſary in order to their coming to him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly; I conſidered the moral depravity of ſinners, ſhewing that they have ſuch an evil heart to depart from the living God, that until their natures are changed, it is impoſſible they ſhould come to Chriſt, or chuſe him &amp; his ſalvation. We are come now, to the</p>
            <p n="4">IV. AND laſt head propoſed; viz. To prove that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners labour under no other impoſſibility of complying with the goſpel, but only what ariſes from their diſincli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to it; or from the badneſs of their hearts.</p>
            <p>I DO not mean, however, nor will any underſtand me, to aſſert this, with reſpect to every <hi>individual</hi> of the human race. For as the apoſtle obſerves, "how ſhall men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him of whom they have not heard? and how ſhall they hear without a preacher?"</p>
            <p>THERE are, undoubtedly, a great many in the world, who, in their preſent circumſtances, could not get the knowledge of the goſpel way of life, if their hearts were good. There are ſome that have not the means of grace; there are others that have not the uſe of reaſon; and there are others who have not, and never had, the ſenſe of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It is not aſſerted concerning any of theſe, that they are not under a natural incapacity to come to Chriſt.
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:011467_0034_0F832F4E1D74CD50"/>
But what I undertake to evince, is only, that perſons who have ordinary intellectual powers, and bodily ſenſes, and are arrived to years of diſcretion, and live under the light of the goſpel, labour under no natural inability to obtain ſalvation: But that if they cannot comply with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed way of life, it muſt be owing intirely to their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inclination to it, or to the badneſs of their hearts.</p>
            <p>THERE are multitudes that evidently do not view the matter in this light. It is needful therefore, that this point ſhould be laboured a little particularly. The</p>
            <p n="1">1. ARG. I ſhall make uſe of for the confirmation of it is, that it is not God's uſual way, to require natural im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities of any of his creatures; and to condemn them for not doing, what they could not, if they would.</p>
            <p>GOD commands none of us to fly above the clouds, or to overturn the mountains by the roots; or to do any <hi>ſuch kind</hi> of impoſſibilities. Yea, we are particularly told in his word, that
<q>if there be firſt a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.</q>
If a man has but little eſtate, it is not expected or required that he ſhould give away a great deal to pious or charitable uſes. If a poor widow caſts in two mites, when it is all ſhe has, it is as well accepted as if it were <hi>two millions.</hi> If a man has never ſo little ſtrength, of body or of mind, a willing exertion and good improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that little, is all that is required of him. This is exceeding evident from thoſe ſummaries of the whole law, which we have both in the old teſtament, and in the new. Moſes ſays, Dieut. 10.12.
<q>And now Iſrael, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to ſerve the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul?</q>
And our Saviour, in anſwer to the queſtion of the ſcribe, which is the great commandment in the law?" ſays, Mat. 22 37—40, and Mark 12, 30.
<q>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:011467_0035_0F832F4EDF002C28"/>
Thy mind, and with all thy ſtrength. This is the firſt and great commandment. And the ſecond is like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thyſelf. On theſe two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</q>
            </p>
            <p>IT is evident from theſe paſſages, that the whole law, in the higheſt perfection of it, is level to ſome kind of capacity which men ſtill have, in the preſent fallen ſtate. We are not to ſuppoſe, indeed, it is their moral capacity; or that all the Lord our God requires of us, is only to love and fear and ſerve him, as much as we are diſpoſed to. This would be no <hi>law</hi> at all. It would be a diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation from all law; a liberty for every one to walk in the way of his own heart, and treat the Deity juſt as his incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation leads him. We are not to ſuppoſe a perfect law, can come down any lower, than to require a perfect heart, and a perfectly good improvement of all the talents and ſtrength we have. And it is evident, neither Moſes, nor our Saviour, underſtood the divine law as requiring more than this. To love and ſerve God, with all the heart, ſoul, mind and ſtrength, cannot mean more than to the utmoſt extent of our natural abilities, be they greater or leſs. Some men are not capable of ſo high a degree of love to God as others, though they are equally upright and well-diſpoſed; becauſe their mental powers are not ſo great; or their advantages to get the knowledge of God have not been ſo good. In like manner ſome cannot <hi>do</hi> ſo much for God, for want of opportunity, &amp;c. Now all proper allowences are made in the divine law, for things of this nature. The more any one has of intellectual or bodily ſtrength, or outward advantages; the more is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him; and the leſs any one has of theſe, the leſs is required. As to loving our neighbour as ourſelves; this is undoubtedly equally in the power of the weak and of the ſtrong, of him that is capable of higher and lower degrees of affection, provided he is equally upright diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted and impartial.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:011467_0036_0F832F4F945AEC18"/>ON the whole, I think it is exceeding plain and evident, that God in his holy and righteous law, requires no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities of any of us, but what become ſo by reaſon of our preſent evil temper of mind, and unwillingneſs to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert the natural ſtrength we have in the manner we ought. And now, if we have natural powers ſufficient for under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and doing our whole duty; and nothing hinders any of us from coming up to all that ſinleſs perfection, which is required in God's perfect law, but only our own wicked hearts; I conclude few will think any thing elſe hinders ſinners of ordinary capacity, who enjoy the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means of grace, from repenting and complying with the goſpel. A</p>
            <p n="2">II. ARG. that ſinners who enjoy the external light of the goſpel, are not under a natural impoſſibility of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with and obeying it, may be drawn from what the ſcriptures plainly teach, and what is generally believed, concerning the great difference that will be made betwixt ſuch ſinners, and thoſe who never heard of a Saviour, as to their final condemnation and puniſhment.</p>
            <p>OUR Saviour let thoſe cities where he had chiefly preached and wrought his miracles, know, that their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal doom would be much the heavier for it; and that it would be more tolerable for even Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgement, than for them. But this, and what is commonly ſaid, about the great guilt of goſpel ſinners above others, ſurely ſuppoſes that there is ſome difference between them and the heathen, as to a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of their underſtanding the way of life, and attaining ſalvation. It ſuppoſes the former have a real price in their hands, which the latter have not. But if the goſpel ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is under a natural inability to repent and believe in Chriſt, an inability ariſing from any thing elſe beſides his own heart, this could not ſurely be the caſe. Why ſhould one who is, &amp; always has been, ſo weak or diſordered in his intellect, as to be incapable of underſtanding the goſpel, be thought a greater ſinner for living in a chriſtian land?
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:011467_0037_0F832F505387ADF8"/>
We do not think this is the caſe as to idiots, or quite deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious perſons. We do not think they will have more to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for than the heathen will. But if we believe a natural impoſſibility is required of men in this caſe, becauſe their natural capacity was impaired or loſt by the fall: then for the ſame reaſon we might expect, that the heathen who never heard of the goſpel, and natural fools who can underſtand nothing about it, would be puniſhed for not embracing it, as much as any. For they would not have been under thoſe diſadvantages had it not been for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy.</p>
            <p>ARG. III. IT is expreſly attributed in ſcripture, to the evil hearts of men, as the ſole cauſe of impenitence and unbelief under the goſpel.</p>
            <p>AND it ought to be particularly obſerved, that this is done with profeſs'd deſign to ſet aſide the plea of ignorance, which ſinners are ſo exceeding apt to harp upon; and to let them ſee that they are without excuſe.
<q>This is the condemnation,</q>
our Saviour ſays,
<q>that light is come into the world; and men have loved darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds are evil.</q>
In another place he ſays,
<q>if ye were blind, ye had not had ſin; but now ye ſay we ſee, therefore your ſin remaineth.</q>
And again;
<q>if I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had ſin: but now have they both ſeen, and hated both me and my father. Now they have no cloke for their ſin.</q>
That is, if they had not had thoſe powers of mind, or thoſe means of conviction that were neceſſary, it is true, they would not have been to blame, it would have been no ſin in them, not to have believed in and received me as their Meſſiah. But now when their underſtandings are good enough; and when means, powerful and ſufficient external means have been uſed with them; their unbelief and rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of me, can be owing to nothing but the deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate wickedneſs of their hearts. It is <hi>knowledge</hi> and not <hi>ignorance</hi> of my character, that is the ſpring of their hatred. Or if any of them are ignorant, it is their own fault.
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:011467_0038_0F832F5113AEA2A0"/>
There is light enough, only they hate it, and will not come to it.</p>
            <p>ARG. IV. That it is not owing to weakneſs of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, or any natural defect, that ſinners in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral under the goſpel are not ſaved, is evident from the inferior abilities of many of thoſe who actually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſalvation,</p>
            <p>IT is not men of the ſtrongeſt and brighteſt genius, and they only, that underſtand and embrace the goſpel; but they are perſons of very ordinary powers of mind, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten if not oftener than any.
<q>Ye ſee your calling bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</q>
ſays the Apoſtle to the Corinthians,
<q>how that not many <hi>wiſe</hi> men after the fleſh,—are called. But God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world, and the weak things to confound the mighty,</q>
&amp;c. And our Saviour ſays,
<q>I thank thee, O father, Lord of heaven and earth, becauſe thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to babes. Even ſo, father, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight.</q>
Though God beſtows the ſpecial influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his grace, juſt where and when he pleaſes, or as ſeemeth good in his ſight, yet he has doubtleſs always a ſufficient reaſon for fixing upon the particular objects of his ſovereign mercy, exactly as he does. We are not to conceive of it, as a blind partiality, but a wiſe ſovereignty, that is exerciſed in this matter. The reaſon why not many of the noble and honorable are called, but rather the baſe and ſuch as are diſpiſed, is, we are told, that no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence. And the reaſon why it ſeemeth good in the ſight of God, to hide theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and to reveal them unto babes, may be, and undoubtedly one reaſon of it is, that hereby it may be made evident, it is not owing to the ſuperior ſtrength of men's natural powers that they diſcover the ſtrait and narrow way which leadeth unto life; nor to their weakneſs, in reſpect of natural abilities, that they do not. If babes are able to ſee the ſuitableneſs and
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:011467_0039_0F832F51E4631810"/>
glory of the goſpel way of ſalvation, unqueſtionably, wiſe men might, were it not for ſomething beſides weakneſs of underſtanding, or any deficiency in the intellect merely. It is evident from hence, that natural weakneſs can be no inſuperable bar in the way of man's obtaining ſalvation, unleſs they are weaker than babes.</p>
            <p>ARG. V. AT leaſt this will be undeniably evident, if we conſider what is done for a perſon when <hi>theſe things are revealed unto him</hi>; or when he is made to ſee
<q>the things of the ſpirit of God, as they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</q>
            </p>
            <p>GOD does not reveal any new truths, not contained in his written word; nor does he give any new faculties to perſons, or enlarge their natural powers of body or of mind, when he enables them to believe and obey the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. But what he does for them, is to alter the temper and diſpoſition of their hearts. If we found all that became real chriſtians, however weak before, were immediately afterwards, perſons of genius and abilities ſuperior to all other men, we ſhould, indeed, have reaſon to ſuſpect that the unregenerate wanted better underſtandings, rather than better hearts, in order to their being able truly to know Jeſus Chriſt, and the way of life. But this is not the caſe. It is the heart that is created a-new, when one becomes a good man, and not the head. We find the natural powers of men are the ſame after regeneration as before; and often far inferior to many of their neighbours, who have experienced no ſuch change. It is true, the wiſdom of good men runs in another channel; they are wiſe to do good, and apt to get divine knowledge; but that is only becauſe they have a taſte for theſe things, and are diſpoſed to take pains about them.
<q>The children of this world are, in their generation, <hi>wiſer</hi> than the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of light.</q>
They proſecute their own ſchemes, &amp; make proficiency in what they turn their hands to, and ſet their hearts upon, beyond what good men do in the things of virtue and religion. What makes good men ſee the
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:011467_0040_0F832F529918C248"/>
glory of God, which others can perceive nothing of, is not their having more ſpeculative knowledge about the divine character, than others have, or are capable of; but their being conformed to God in temper &amp; in heart; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to him "in righteouſneſs and true holineſs." This, indeed, makes divine things, and all things of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral nature, appear in quite a new light; &amp; hence they are ſaid to be <hi>renewed in knowledge.</hi> He that is altogether unholy, let his head be never ſo clear, and his ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive knowledge never ſo great, cannot have all that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of holineſs, which the weakeſt ſaint has, who feels the opperation and power of it in his own heart. There is no knowledge like that we get by experience. A man that has never felt a particular kind of pain, we ſay, can have no idea of it; ſo of parental affection, one who has never experienced it, knows not what it is. The ſame may be ſaid of all kinds of ſenſations and affections; the experiencing them, gives a knowledge of them that can no otherways be obtained. And this holds true with reſpect to holy exerciſes and affections as much as any other. Hence, thoſe who are made
<q>partakers of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature,</q>
or who have
<q>put on the new man which after God is created in righteouſneſs and true holineſs,</q>
are capable of a kind of knowledge of God, which is peculiar to themſelves. Accordingly the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle John ſays,
<q>Every one that loveth, is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love.</q>
1 John iv. 7, 8. He who is acquainted with the feelings of univerſal benevolence, in his own breaſt, has a different idea of him who
<q>is good unto all, and whoſe tender mercies are over all his works,</q>
than he whoſe heart is contracted, and who is truly good to none, has, or is capable of. Particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; he who is conformed in heart to God, ſees a beauty in his character and government, which no one of an intirely oppoſite temper can poſſibly do. The reaſon is, whatever any one regards, and is zealous about, he is
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:011467_0041_0F832F565EE489F0"/>
neceſſarily pleaſed to ſee others regard, and be engaged in promoting. Thus if a man values his own particular intereſt or reputation, as every one does, he is thence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably pleaſed to ſee others tender of it, and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to promote it. And if a man is benevolently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for the public intereſt, he will in like manner be peculiarly delighted to ſee others public ſpirited and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly aiming to ſecure and advance the general good. The intirely ſelfiſh ſoul, feels as if his own private hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs was the moſt valuable, yea the <hi>only</hi> valuable thing in all the univerſe. Hence if he can only believe, God has ſet his kindeſt love on <hi>him,</hi> from eternity; and ſent his only Son from his boſom to die for <hi>his</hi> ſake, (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſary or unneceſſary, wiſe or unwife, right or wrong, it matters not;) this gives him the moſt exalted, the moſt glorious conception, of the parent and lord of all worlds, that his narrow ſoul can poſſibly contain.—But, to him that is born of God, and aſſimulated in temper, to his father which is in heaven, things will appear in a quite different light. To him who is made to be in any meaſure of a true, a God-like public ſpirit, an impartial, infinite diſpoſition to maintain univerſal order, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote univerſal good, is the grand, the infinite beauty.</p>
            <p>To have the ſpirit of Chriſt, or the ſame mind that was in him, is, in like manner, the only thing that can ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a perſon to have that ſenſe which all ſaints have, of the greatneſs and glory of his redeeming love. Hence it was the apoſtle Paul's prayer for the Epheſians,
<q>that they being <hi>rooted</hi> and <hi>grounded</hi> in love, might be able to comprehend with <hi>all ſaints,</hi> what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Chriſt, which paſſeth knowledge.</q>
Eph. iii, 17, 18, 19.</p>
            <p>AND to have a heavenly, that is, a holy temper and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is neceſſary in order to have a true underſtanding of any thing heavenly; any thing of
<q>the inheritance of the ſaints in light,</q>
or of what
<q>God hath prepared
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:011467_0042_0F832F5711D05938"/>
for them that love him.</q>
This the Apoſtle very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly and largely takes notice of, in 1 Cor. ii, 11—15. "For what man," ſays he,
<q>knoweth the things of a man, ſave the ſpirit of man which is in him?</q>
The <hi>ſpirit of man</hi>; the narrowneſs, pride, and various corrupt affections by which mankind are actuated, would be very incomprehenſible to us, did we not feel, and had we never felt, any thing of the ſame in our own breaſts. We ſhould be perfectly amazed to ſee how men act, not being able to conceive what inward feelings or principles ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite them to behave in ſuch a manner.—The <hi>things of a man</hi>; the enjoyments which fallen creatures ſo fondly dote on, and ſo eagerly purſue after, to one who never had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing of their ſpirit, it would be inconceivable how there could be any thing gratifying, or agreeable in them, to any mortal.—
<q>So the things of God knoweth no man, but the ſpirit of God.</q>
The enjoyments of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and of heaven, can no more be perceived to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing in them, by one who is intirely deſtitute of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and heavenly temper.—
<q>Now we have received, not the ſpirit of the world, but the ſpirit which is of God; that we might know <hi>the things that are freely given to us of God.</hi>
               </q>
That is, the holy delights &amp; enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments provided for ſaints in a future world.
<q>Which things alſo we ſpeak, not in the words which man's wiſdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghoſt teacheth; comparing ſpiritual things with ſpiritual.</q>
—In deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe future glories and felicities, we do not make uſe of ſuch language as a carnal taſte would ſuggeſt, or as would be thought the true ſublime, by the wiſe of this world: but we ſpeak of them in a manner to which we are led by the ſpirit of holineſs. To give us the moſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated ideas of the joys to be expected in heaven, we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them, not with the idolized poſſeſſions and delights of time and ſenſe, but with thoſe ſpiritual enjoyments, thoſe holy exerciſes and gratifications, which true ſaints experience, in ſome low degree, in this lower world.—
<q>
                  <pb n="44" facs="unknown:011467_0043_0F832F5A5029F080"/>But the natural man receiveth not the things of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God: for they are fooliſhneſs unto him; neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</q>
—The unrenewed ſinner, having nothing ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in him, to compare ſpiritual things with, being a ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſpiritual joys, or the feelings and pleaſures of a truly virtuous mind, they will neceſſarily ſeem empty, out of the way things to him; nor can he perceive their true excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and worth, becauſe their being perceived thus, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends intirely upon the ſpirit and temper a man is of.</p>
            <p>IT appears from theſe paſſages, that it is neither the hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing new truths ſuggeſted, that are not contained in the ſcriptures; nor the having the underſtanding convinced of the truths contained in them; nor the having new fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of mind given, or the old ones enlarged, or mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or any how made better, that enables a man to ſee God, or Chriſt, or heavenly things, as ſaints ſee them. But that a foundation is, and can be laid for this, only by a man's becoming a ſaint, or having a new ſpirit given him; <hi>the ſpirit which is of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN a word; whatever is ſaid by ſome about rectifying the natural faculties, it is very generally agreed, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation is not a <hi>phyſical</hi> change, but a <hi>moral</hi> one. That it conſiſts, not in making men <hi>great,</hi> but in making them <hi>good.</hi> That the new creation, is nothing elſe but the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral image of God, conſiſting in righteouſneſs and true holineſs. But if theſe things are ſo, then certainly all the inability that is removed, and conſequently all that wants to be removed, by the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt, is intirely of a moral nature. An inability which altogether conſiſts, in the want of an honeſt and good heart.</p>
            <p>ARG. VI. This way of conceiving of the impotence of fallen men, does not fruſtrate, but tends moſt of all to advance and magnify, the grace of God.</p>
            <p>UNDOUBTEDLY that view of the inability of man, which is moſt eaſily and fairly reconcilable with the juſtice of God, ought to be embraced, provided it does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:011467_0044_0F832F5AE3431D68"/>
from the freeneſs and riches of divine grace, in the ſinners ſalvation. Now I preſume there are few, but what are ſenſible of ſome difficulty, in reconciling God's requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing natural impoſſibilities of us, with any notions we have of juſtice. As if he ſhould require a man to fly, or lift a million weight, or make a world. And ſhould ſuſpend his ſalvation on the condition of his doing ſuch things as theſe, which are evidently beyond the capacity of any man, let his diſpoſition be as it will. And ſhould ſay he had no cloak for his ſin, in not doing things of this nature. And that for his not complying with ſuch a merciful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of ſalvation, it ſhould be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for him. I ſay, I believe there are few, but muſt be ſenſible of ſome difficulty in ſeeing into the reaſonableneſs, and juſtice of this. But then, perhaps they may think, there is no way to leave room for ſuch a diſplay of divine grace, as we are taught there is, in the ſalvation of men, without ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing ſomething like this to be in fact the caſe. They may think there can be no neceſſity of the grace of the Holy Ghoſt, on ſuppoſition ſinners can comply with the Goſpel, whenever they are diſpoſed to. But any appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of this kind, muſt ariſe from a very favourable opinion of the goodneſs of the ſinners diſpoſition. As if he was ſo willing to uſe his talents, and improve the price put into his hands aright, that God has no way ſufficiently to diſplay his grace towards him, but by requiring things of him, which the holieſt creature in the univerſe, under his circumſtances, could not perform. If men are ill-diſpoſed, they ſo far ſtand in need of grace to enable them to do, that which without any ſuch divine help they would find no difficulty in, if they were well diſpoſed. And is it not eaſy to ſee, that it will require as much power, and more grace, to change a ſinners heart, than to alter a man's head, or enlarge any of his natural faculties?</p>
            <p>THE ſot, who has lived in a courſe of intemperance from twenty to three ſcore, is ſtill under no inability to reform,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:011467_0045_0F832F5BBB2DF6A0"/>
but only what ariſes from his own appetite and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He might ſtill refuſe the glaſs, and become a ſober man, without any body's advice or help, if his own will was not wanting. But yet no one would think it a leſs unpromiſing undertaking, to go about to reclaim ſuch a perſon, than to cure one of a bodily infirmity in which the patient's will had no hand, and which he could not get rid of himſelf, let him be never ſo heartily, and ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, and ſtrongly deſirous of it. Suppoſe ſuch a one, that had had all motives, fetched from this world and the world to come, repeatedly urged upon him, in the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt and moſt forcible manner by all his friends; but without the leaſt effect. Should one at laſt, find means to perſuade him into a thorough and laſting reformation; would he not be thought to do as great a thing, as he that ſhould cure one of a natural infirmity that had long baffled the ſkill of all the phyſicians?</p>
            <p>MORAL ſickneſs may be as hard to cure, and require as powerful means, and as able a phyſician, as natural ſickneſs. And if a man is dead in the moral ſenſe; that is, has loſt all principles of true virtue intirely, he is as abſolutely beyond the reach of all means, as to their bringing of him to life again, as one that is dead in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſenſe. Moral means, can only work upon ſuch moral principles, as they find to work upon. They cannot produce a <hi>new nature, new principles</hi> of action, any more than natural means can make new life for themſelves to work upon, in a dead carcaſe. Cultivation and manur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may make a bad tree grow, and bear fruit, after it's kind. But can never make a thorn bear figs, or a bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-buſh, grapes. Let what means will be uſed, ſo long as the tree is evil, the fruit will be ſo likewiſe. If man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind have loſt the moral image of God intirely, it is eaſy to ſee, that nothing ſhort of a new creation, can reſtore it to them. If they are <hi>dead</hi> in treſpaſſes and ſins, the quickening them, muſt be an inſtance of the working of God's mighty power, in a ſupernatural manner, like
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:011467_0046_0F832F5C6F70D620"/>
that of raiſing Chriſt from the dead. And without a work of this kind, whatever means are uſed with them, they will never have the leaſt ſpiritual life, or real holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Ob. Regeneraion is frequently repreſented in ſcripture, as being effected by means. Men are ſaid to be born again by the word of God. 1 Pet. i. 23. To be begotten by the word of truth. James i. 18. And Paul ſays to the Corinthians, "In Chriſt Jeſus I have begotten you through the goſpel." But how is this to be reconciled with making the quickening of ſinners, properly a ſupernatural work?</p>
                  <p>Anſ. Almoſt all the ſupernatural works, recorded in the ſcriptures, are repreſented as wrought by means, as much as regeneration is. The red-ſea was divided by Moſes's rod; and the river Jordan by Elijah's mantle. It was by ſmiting the flinty rock, in the wilderneſs, that the waters were made to flow out of it like a river. Moſes brought forth this water, as much as Paul regenerated the Corinthians. It was by throwing a ſtick into the river, that the young prophet's ax was made to ſwim; and by waſhing ſeven times in Jordan, that Naaman was heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his leproſy. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> was by propheſying over a valley of dry bones, as repreſented in the viſion of Ezekiel, and calling to the four winds to breath upon them, that they were converted into a living army. It was with clay made of dirt and ſpittle, that our Saviour opened the eyes of one that was born blind. And by calling with a loud voice, that Lazarus was made to hear, and come out of his grave, after he had been dead four days.</p>
                  <p>Now to ſuppoſe that regeneration is effected by means, as much as theſe things were, is not inconſiſtent with its being properly a ſupernatural work. But that it is effected by the <hi>power</hi> of means, is what the ſcriptures are far from leading us to conceive. It would be thought very remarkable, if any one ſhould undertake to explain the connection, betwixt the means uſed and the effects wrought, in thoſe inſtances now mentioned, in as natural and intelligable a manner as ſome have attempted to do, betwixt light in the underſtanding, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of grace in the heart of a totally depraved ſinner. But yet, I apprehend, any of thoſe things, may be as rationally accounted for, from the known laws of nature, as regeneration can; and that the plain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſcripture, as much obliges us to think, the former were ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the power, or natural tendency, or proper cauſality of means, as that the latter is.</p>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>AND now, does not the admiting ſuch a total moral depravity, ſuppoſe room and neceſſity enough, for the grace of the Holy Ghoſt in the ſalvation of men, without ſuppoſing any deficiency in their natural faculties?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:011467_0047_0F832F5D18184A08"/>BUT let us compare the two hypotheſes, that of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inability, and the contrary one which I have now been endeavouring to prove, and we may eaſily ſee which gives the higheſt conception of the grace of God. Thoſe who conceive ſinners labour under a natural incapacity to come to Chriſt, place the defect in the underſtanding. They ſuppoſe that ignorance and miſ-apprehenſion, is the primary cauſe of all our enmity and oppoſition to God. And conſequently, that as ſoon as the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing comes to be rectified and rightly informed, we of courſe become reconciled in heart to the ways of God; and pleaſed with the character and mediation of Chriſt. This ſeems to ſuppoſe we always had been conformed to God's real character, in the temper of our minds; and that all we had been quarrelling with, and enemies to, was only a falſe idea of God; or ſuch a character as no one <hi>ought</hi> to love. As if a very righteous man, ſhould be prejudiced againſt &amp; greatly engaged in oppoſing another, that was really as righteous and good a man as himſelf. But he had been miſ-informed about him, and conceiv'd him to be quite a different man, from what he really was. Now as ſoon as his underſtanding comes to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enlightened, or his miſtakes are removed, and he gets a thorough acquaintance, the good man loves the good man, of courſe, without any change of character in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But, ſhall we view the enmity of the carnal mind againſt God in this light, in order to have the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted idea of the divine grace, in the ſalvation of ſuch a carnal perſon? Shall we ſuppoſe that the reaſon, and the only reaſon, why he is not, neither indeed can be, ſubject to the law of God, is becauſe he does not, neither indeed can underſtand it? Or becauſe, through the weakneſs of his natural powers, he underſtands it ſo, as it would be wicked to obey it, and no truly virtuous and upright mind, could be ſubject to it, or ſuited with it, in <hi>his ſenſe</hi> of it?—In that caſe, all that is neceſſary to be done by the divine ſpirit, is, to inform us rightly concerning the
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:011467_0048_0F832F5DEA6F6358"/>
holy nature and ways of God; and let us know that all our hatred of him, is owing to a <hi>mere miſunderſtanding</hi>; and that he is really juſt ſuch a being, as we all natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love; even altogether ſuch an one as ourſelves. Can there be a neceſſity of any thing ſupernatural, in bringing a ſinner "out of darkneſs into God's marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous light," if this is all that is implied in it?—Yes, it will be ſaid, a ſupernatural work upon the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> is ſtill neceſſary. Though light alone, will produce all the change of heart that is wanted; yet not <hi>objective</hi> light merely, but what may perhaps be called <hi>ſubjective</hi> light. That is, the underſtanding itſelf, muſt be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, or enlarged, or brightened, or ſome how made better; otherways the external light, however clear, will ſhine in darkneſs, and cannot be comprehended.</p>
            <p>Now if this is the ſupernatural work of the ſpirit, which perſons are the ſubjects of when they are born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, it is of the ſame nature, as if a natural fool, ſhould, by a miracle, have reaſon given him. <note n="*" place="bottom">It is apprehended, this repreſentation of the matter, will be tho't no fair, if not quite ridiculous. Men don't mean to be made <hi>natural</hi> fools of, neither. The weakneſs, and blindneſs, and want of abilities ſo much complain'd of, is nothing of this kind. They would be thought to have as much wit, as much reaſon, and good ſenſe, as the beſt, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their darkneſs of underſtanding. Nay, they may exceed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a Locke, or a Sir Iſaac Newton in clearneſs and ſtrength of mind, and yet have ſuch weak intellects, as to be incapable of underſtanding truly, the plaineſt principles of the oracles of God. Thus the reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the head, and the heart, are equally taken care of; while the poor <hi>defect,</hi> which muſt bear the blame of all the ſin in the world, is crouded into a corner of the ſoul, which no ſoul has, and therefore, which <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> cares how much is ſaid againſt.</note> But is this the way to advance the grace of God moſt, in our ſalvation? Is it the moſt wonderful inſtance of rich grace, to give an intelligent mind, to one whoſe heart was ſo good, that he only wanted to have reaſon enough to be able to underſtand the goſpel, and he would em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it moſt cordially as ſoon as ever it was propoſed to him? does the grace appear ſo great in this, as in chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:011467_0049_0F832F5EE5234360"/>
the heart of one who was an enemy to the <hi>true</hi> God? One that might have had light enough, only he hated the light and would not come to it? Or one that had had the light of conviction forced upon him, and had both ſeen and hated, both the Father and the Son, both the law and the goſpel?</p>
            <p>LET any one only think how he would addreſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to God, with a view to magnify the riches of his grace in ſaving him. Would he think that leſſening his former natural abilities as much as poſſible, was the way to do this moſt effectually? Would he acknowledge that man by the fall had loſt his rational powers, and was become no wiſer than the beaſts of the field, and of no more underſtanding than the fouls of heaven; and therefore, that he had been utterly incapable of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what a kind of being God was, or what his law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, or getting any juſt notions concerning Chriſt and the way of ſalvation? That no one whoſe mental powers were ſo weak, or ſo much diſordered, as his had always been, could ever poſſibly get a true underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any of thoſe things? And if God had not been graciouſly pleaſed to give him a better <hi>head,</hi> he muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably have been loſt forever? Is this, I ſay, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment one would make, with a view to glorify ſovereign grace, in bringing him out of darkneſs into marvelous light?—Or would he not rather acknowledge the goodneſs of God, in giving him rational powers in his firſt formation, and ſo rendering him capable of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a higher and happier part than the mere ſenſitive creation; capable of ſerving and enjoying God as a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional creature? Would he not acknowledge that, tho' God might moſt juſtly have deprived him of all the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar dignities and advantages of the rational nature, for his own and not merely for Adam's abuſe of them, yet he had not done it? That he had not been denied the uſe of reaſon, or the opportunity and means of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God as many had been? But that under all theſe
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:011467_0050_0F832F5F73602538"/>
advantages to know God, he had not glorified him as God, nor been thankful. That he had ſhut his eyes againſt the cleareſt light, turned a deaf ear to the moſt gracious calls, and hated the beſt of Beings; hated him, not for what he is not, but for what he is; for his righteouſneſs, for his holineſs; for thoſe very things for which angels and ſaints, ſo much admire and love him. And that the more he knew of God and Chriſt, the more he hated them; and ſhould forever have done ſo, had not divine grace moſt aſtoniſhingly interpoſed in favour of ſo vile a wretch, and changed his nature, given him quite another ſpirit.</p>
            <p>IT is ſtrange if any <hi>ſhould</hi> ſeriouſly think, that diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abroad their natural weakneſſes and infirmities, and alledging theſe as the only cauſes why they have not known or done, better than they have, is the way to humble themſelves moſt before God, and to do the moſt honor to his grace in their ſalvation.</p>
            <p>THOSE who hold to natural inability, and ſuppoſe all that ſinners want, is to have their underſtandings rectifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thereby virtually and really, tho' I ſuppoſe not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly, deny moral depravity altogether. But ſhould we ſuppoſe ſinners are depraved, and even totally depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, in the temper of their minds; but that they are ſo impaired in their natural powers too, as to be incapable of underſtanding and complying with the goſpel, if their hearts were good: This natural inability <hi>in addition</hi> to the moral, would not lay a foundation for a larger and fuller diſplay of divine grace in their ſalvation, but the contrary. Suppoſe mankind, when they loſt the moral image of God, had loſt their reaſon too, and become fools in the natural ſenſe; and that when their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings were reſtored, they were renewed in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of their minds alſo; then, you ſee, they would never have had opportunity to <hi>diſcover</hi> their moral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity, as when they have had underſtandings good enough, and have known God, but in works have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:011467_0051_0F832F6026EDDDB8"/>
him, being abominable, and diſobedient, and to every good work reprobate. It would not appear to themſelves, or to any but the Searcher of Hearts, what an evil diſpoſition they had been of, and what a moral change had been wrought in them. And conſequently, the divine grace towards them, if it was in reality as great, would not be <hi>manifeſted</hi> ſo much. But, indeed, the grace of God in the ſalvation of men, on that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, would not in reality <hi>be</hi> ſo great. The better underſtandings any have, and abuſe, the greater is their guilt; and conſequently the greater the grace that ſaves them.</p>
            <p>ALL that now remains is the <hi>Improvement.</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. FROM what has been ſaid I think it follows, that there is no foundation for conceiving of ſinners as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to blame and inexcuſable, in part of their neglect of the great ſalvation, and not in the whole of it; or that they may reaſonably be exhorted, to do part of what is implied in coming to Chriſt, but not the whole. Some ſeem to ſuppoſe that unregenerate ſinners are not to blame for not doing things which imply real holineſs, and can't be done without, as repenting truly of their ſins, believing in Chriſt, loving God, &amp;c. But that for not doing other things, which may be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any holineſs at heart, as reforming externally, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. they are altogether inexcuſable. But is not this evidently a diſtinction without any juſt foundation? Either the natural abilities of men muſt be the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their duty, and all they come ſhort of this is ſin; or elſe their duty is to be meaſured by their moral ability, and they are to blame only ſo far as they fall ſhort of doing, what they have a heart to do. Now if we are under obligation to do well, to the utmoſt of our <hi>natural</hi> power, and no abatement of duty ought to be made, on account of an evil heart, or the want of a good one; then ſinners are to blame and altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable, in not forſaking ſin heartily, as well as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally;
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:011467_0052_0F832F60D842C8F0"/>
in not believing in Chriſt, loving God and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cordially obedient to his will. For none of theſe things are impoſſible to ſuch as are well diſpoſed. But if <hi>moral</hi> power is the meaſure of duty, if want of a diſpoſition to do otherways than a man does, renders him excuſable and not to blame; then <hi>all</hi> are excuſable, <hi>none</hi> are to blame. The thoughtleſs and ſecure, the prayerleſs and profane, the moſt profligate and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, are as excuſable, as little to blame as any others. For the inclinations of the worſt of men, it may, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great ſtretch of charity, be ſuppoſed, are as bad as their actions are. They are none of them any more wicked than they are diſpoſed to be. Nor have any of them a moral power to be any better. The diſſolute and immoral might reform, it is true, if they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to. The careleſs ſinner might become ſerious and thoughtful about his ſalvation, might read and hear, meditate and pray, if he was ſo diſpoſed. But it is as true, that ſinners might come to the ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the way of life, might repent and believe the goſpel, were they ſo diſpoſed. Nothing but a heart is wanting in one eaſe any more than in the other: And that is wanting in both caſes.
<q>The vile perſon <hi>will ſpeak</hi> villany, and his heart <hi>will</hi> work iniquity, to practice hypocriſy, to utter error, &amp;c.</q>
We are told that "the heart of the ſons of men is full of evil." And what they will do, if left to themſelves, we are alſo told. See Rom. i. 27—31.
<q>God gave them over to a reprobate mind;</q>
that is, left them to act their own minds without reſtraint. And what was the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence?
<q>They were filled with all unrighteouſneſs, fornication, wickedneſs, covetouſneſs, maliciouſneſs, full of envy, murder, &amp;c.</q>
The ſcandalous ſinner will not become externally reformed, without reſtraining grace; nor will the ſecure ſinner ſeek and pray, and uſe the means of grace, unleſs he is awakened; any more than a man will come to Chriſt, without the
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:011467_0053_0F832F61927BB468"/>
drawing of the father. The drunkard has not a moral power, that is, a ſufficient inclination, to forſake his cups, while he does not forſake them; nor the lewd perſon to forſake his lewd practices; nor the murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to hold back his hand from ſhedding of blood, any more than the natural man has to embrace the goſpel.</p>
            <p>THERE is therefore no propriety in exhorting the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate, to do only ſuch things as are conſiſtent with an intirely depraved and wicked heart, as if nothing further could be expected of them at preſent, any more than there would be in exhorting the moſt abandon'd of mankind, to do only what is conſiſtent with their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and courſe of life, becauſe nothing better can be expected of them, till they are better diſpoſed, or are under greater reſtraints.</p>
            <p>ACCORDINGLY, there is no ſuch compounding with the natural man, for what he can do, without a heart to do any thing that is good, to be met with any where in the ſacred ſcriptures. God's <hi>preſent</hi> demand upon every one of us is, "give me thy heart." He does not ſay, give me thy external obedience only, make a decent ſhew of ſeeking and ſerving me, and it ſhall ſuffice for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; for as for thy heart, I know,
<q>there is no hope, it hath loved ſtrangers, and after them it <hi>will</hi> go.</q>
The law requires truth <hi>in the inward parts</hi>; yea it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands a perfect heart.
<q>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy ſtrength; and thy neighbor as thy ſelf.</q>
Not, thou ſhalt ſeek and pray for this temper, towards God and man, but thou ſhalt <hi>have</hi> it.—The New-Teſtament preachers of ſalvation through Chriſt, ſay,
<q>repent and believe the goſpel. Repent and be converted that your ſins may be blotted out.</q>
The ſum of their preaching, "both to the Jews, and alſo to the Greeks," was,
<q>repentance toward God, and
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:011467_0054_0F832F6258F10668"/>
faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</q>
Not teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, "as the manner of ſome is," that if ſinners will do what they can, (meaning what their wicked hearts will let them do, what the carnal mind which is enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, may conſent to,) they will not be left to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; but God will undoubtedly have pity on them, and afford them further help.</p>
            <p>CERTAINLY, if the divine law is juſt, no man can juſtly excuſe himſelf, or be excuſed, ſhort of a perfect heart, and a perfect life. And if the goſpel is true, there is no ſafety for any ſinner, no ground of dependence that God will have mercy on him, or ever ſhew him any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, ſhort of Chriſt, &amp; an actual intereſt in him by faith.
<q>He that believeth not, is condemned already, becauſe he hath not believed in the name of the only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son of God. He that believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee life; but the wrath of God abideth on him. He that believeth not ſhall be damned.</q>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis extremely obvious, that the ſcriptures every where treat the impenitent and the unbeliever, with as little ceremony as any ſinners whatſoever. And it is exceeding evident, I think, from what has now been ſaid, that reaſon affords no plea in their favour, but what will equally excuſe any ſinner in the world, in being as he is, &amp; in doing as he does. If the want of a good heart, is a good plea, every ſinner, and every imperfect ſaint, may avail himſelf of it to his compleat juſtification. Thoſe who are ſanctified but in part, cannot be blamed for being but imperfectly holy. Thoſe who have no true holineſs at all, cannot be required to have any, or be blam'd if they act as well as they can without it. And, by the ſame rule, not ſo much as an external re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, can be required of thoſe who have no mind to reform. Nothing can be ſaid to the purpoſe of excuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinners on account of the badneſs of their hearts, unleſs we would undertake to maintain this general principle, that the duty of every one, muſt be only juſt
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:011467_0055_0F832F63210E6700"/>
according to every one's diſpoſition. But if this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is true, every one muſt eaſily ſee, there can never be any ſuch thing as neglect of duty, or deſert of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, or need of grace, in the univerſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. FROM what has been ſaid it may appear, that there is no force in that common plea in the mouths of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, namely, That they did not bring their depravity upon themſelves, but were born with it. If their hearts are altogether ſinful, they did'nt 'make them ſo, nor is it any of their fault; they have only ſuch hearts as were given them, without their choice or conſent.—Now in arguing thus, they evidently view a wicked heart, in no other light than as a mere weakneſs, which a man would not chooſe, but it is what he cannot help. They conſider it as a thing not at all faulty in its <hi>own nature</hi>; ſo that if they are to blame about it, it muſt be for ſomething previous to it, and quite of another nature. Concerning innocent natural infirmities, we juſtly judge in the above manner. Thus if a man is ſick, we don't blame him for it; we know bodily ſickneſs is no moral evil. But if we are told the man brought his ſickneſs upon himſelf, by intemperance, or ſome bad conduct, then we fault and condemn him; that was a moral evil, though this is not·—Now thoſe who make the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove plea, reaſon juſt in this manner about <hi>ſin itſelf.</hi> As if it was not ſin, merely to <hi>be a ſinner</hi>; or to commit ſin when one has an inclination to. But that the <hi>bringing a ſinful diſpoſition upon ourſelves,</hi> had we done this, would indeed have been a very wicked thing.</p>
            <p>HENCE it ſeems to many, as if the poor ſinful chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, were only as it were under a fit of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which Adam brought on himſelf and them, by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an evil deed which he might eaſily enough have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, in as much as he was perfectly holy; but that we his miſerable offspring, being by nature ſinners, are under a neceſſity of ſinning, and therefore cannot be to blame for it. It ſeems as if <hi>Adam</hi> was in reality the
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:011467_0056_0F832F63EBC640C8"/>
only ſinner, and his <hi>firſt</hi> ſin, the only ſin of the human kind; becauſe that ſin was committed while man had, not an imaginary, but a real, a moral as well as natural power, to abſtain from all ſin. That is; the firſt ſin did not ariſe from, or conſiſt in, any defect in the will; and herein conſiſts the ſinfulneſs of it. If Adam did'nt ſin before he had any inclination to, and while he was ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough inclin'd to the contrary, it is eaſy to ſee, he had juſt the ſame excuſe for his firſt ſin, as we have for any of ours. Let his firſt ſin be placed where it will, whether in actually eating the forbidden fruit; or in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening to any temptations to do it; or in being off his watch; or in whatever any one pleaſes, ſtill we muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it committed while his heart was perfectly good, elſe he did'nt ſin without this boaſted excuſe of other ſinners, want of a moral power to do otherways. Thus by forgetting that ſin is in itſelf ſinful, we are led to look for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe that is ſo, not in ſinners, but in perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent beings! We are led to ſuppoſe, creatures are capable of being to blame, no longer, or further, than they are holy! We conceive Adam to blame, becauſe of the uprightneſs of his heart; and ourſelves blameleſs, becauſe our hearts are ſo wicked! For in this way, we certainly bring nothing but perfect holineſs into the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as an aggravation of Adam's ſin, beyond thoſe of his poſterity.</p>
            <p>THE very firſt idea we can have of ſin, is a depraved and wicked heart. And if this is not a blameable thing <hi>in itſelf,</hi> there is no danger of finding any thing that is. Could we clearly confound all diſtinction betwixt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and moral evil, and ſo betwixt natural and moral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability, as things <hi>eſſentially</hi> different, from our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, we ſhould be ſecure enough. And in matters of religion, men generally do confound theſe things ſo far as to feel very eaſy, and very much as if there <hi>was no ſin.</hi> But let a neighbour be very unkind and injurious to
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:011467_0057_0F832F64CCDBDAD8"/>
them, and they begin to ſee a difference. This does not look to them, juſt as if he was only lame, and unable to go out of their way. Nor do they lay the blame upon Adam, but upon the malicious and unrighteous wretch himſelf. Nor does their being told, it is his <hi>very nature</hi> to be ſo, make them think much the better of him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. IF the diſtinction now inſiſted on was well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and clearly kept in view, it would appear, in like manner, that a ſinner's not being able to change his own heart, is really nothing in his favour. Here, ſome may be ready to think, is the grand difficulty after all. What they wanted to know, was, not whether ſinners <hi>would</hi> be able to comply with the goſpel, or to obey the law, if their hearts were good; but whether it is in their power to have ſuch an heart in them. For what does it ſignify what a man could do, if he had that which he has not, and can by no means obtain?—Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners don't ſee how it is their own fault, that they have ſuch bad hearts, and do nothing from gracious princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, provided it is not in their own power to alter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this reſpect.</p>
            <p>NOW if a wicked heart was not a <hi>moral evil,</hi> but a thing of the ſame nature as a weak head, a bad memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or an infirm conſtitution, this would be the caſe. A man is not to blame for having theſe, provided he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help it. But if a wicked heart is a thing of a crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal nature, a thing quite different from any ſuch natural weakneſſes, then there is no force in the above reaſoning. If to have a heart to hate and oppoſe, God and our neighbour, inſtead of loving them as we are required, is a moral evil; as certainly it is, and the ſum of <hi>all</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral evil; then to ſay a man can't alter in this reſpect, is only to ſay he can't help being a moſt vile and inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable wretch. To be unalterably in love with ſin, does not ſurely render one the leſs <hi>ſinful,</hi> but the more ſo. Surely the wickeder a man's heart is, the more faulty and to blame he is.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="unknown:011467_0058_0F832F655BC6EA88"/>BUT the fallacy, whereby ſinners elude their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences in this matter, lies in a ſecret ſuppoſition that they could not change their hearts, nor would they be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, though they ſhould never ſo <hi>ſincerely,</hi> and <hi>heartily,</hi> and <hi>uprightly try</hi> to do it; which would indeed be a very hard caſe. If a ſinner honeſtly, and from a truly virtuous diſpoſition, tried, to the utmoſt of his natural power, to alter his entirely wicked diſpoſition, but it would'nt alter; he was as bad as ever after all; it would ſeem indeed, that he was in a very pitiable ſituation, but not very faulty. Yea, it would be difficult to ſee wherein he was <hi>at all</hi> to blame. And that ſomething like this, is the real view which multitudes have of the matter, is very evident.</p>
            <p>LET us put the caſe (as people would have it) that ſinners were, in all reſpects, able to change their own hearts. Only it muſt take ſome time, a <hi>month</hi> ſuppoſe; and they muſt apply themſelves very diligently, very faithfully to the work, all that while, in order to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh it. There is a ſinner, however, that neglects his opportunity, and ſpends the whole month in ſin, without ever uſing any means, or making the leaſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to get a good heart. Is he not to blame now for this? Moſt certainly he is. But why ſo? Why ſo!— Does not every one ſee that ſuch careleſneſs in a caſe like this, ſuch indifference about becoming good, when it was entirely in one's power, muſt be inexcuſable to the laſt degree? To continue thus in ſin, when there was no manner of neceſſity of it; ſurely this can never be juſtified.—But another ſinner was much better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd. He ſeiz'd the favourable opportunity, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied himſelf with the greateſt imaginable diligence; and at the month's end, actually became a good man. Now was <hi>he</hi> to blame, during this time that he was thus faithfully labouring, and doing all in his power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come good? By no means. But why not? He had a bad heart. Yes, but he did as well as ever he could, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:011467_0059_0F832F66201EABE8"/>
that. No man could have done better, under his circumſtances. And he was actually of a wicked <hi>diſpoſition,</hi> no longer, than till he could poſſibly be otherways.</p>
            <p>THUS people would be apt to judge in ſuch caſes. And this ſhews what notions men have of inability with reference to the ſinner's changing his heart; and what the reaſon is they ſay the diſtinction of natural and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inability ſignifies nothing. For by whatever <hi>name</hi> it is called, they will conceive of it as being of the ſame <hi>nature.</hi> If they own it lies in the wicked diſpoſition of the ſinner altogether, yet they don't conceive it lies in the diſpoſition he <hi>acts from,</hi> but in a great, ugly diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he is <hi>acting againſt,</hi> but is unable to overcome. They ſuppoſe the inability he labours under is ſuch, that he may be well diſpos'd, and do well; yea, that he may be diſpos'd to do the whole duty of one under his circumſtances, and actually do it, and yet not be able to help being of an entirely depraved and wicked diſpoſition. Nor could they find the leaſt ſhadow of an excuſe for him, did they not view his caſe in this abſurd light;—did they not conſider him as faithfully exerting himſelf, with an honeſt and good intention, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>become good,</hi> but all in vain. Or at leaſt, did they not ſuppoſe him willing enough to exert himſelf in this manner, only he knows it will ſignify nothing. In this way it is that a perverſe and ſtubborn will, a wicked and unwilling mind, comes to be thought as innocent a thing, and as good an excuſe, as any in the world. It is view'd as a mere weakneſs; a thing not inconſiſtent with <hi>trying</hi> to be holy, but inconſiſtent with <hi>being</hi> ſo, let one try never ſo heartily. Which is the proper noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of natural inability. And to maintain this notion, they have a double meaning to every word, by which "the abominable thing" which men are to blame for, can poſſibly be expreſſed. <hi>Sins</hi> they diſtinguiſh into vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, and involuntary, neceſſary and unneceſſary,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:011467_0060_0F832F66E2BC3258"/>
faulty and faultleſs ones. They alſo make two ſorts of <hi>wicked hearts.</hi> One that is really wicked, and for which men are to blame; another that is totally wicked, but not really ſo at all, and which is no man's own fault. Could they only be made ſenſible that their ſins, and their wicked hearts, were of the bad <hi>kind,</hi> their mouths would be ſtopped. But to faſten a conviction of this upon them, is one of the moſt difficult things in the world. They will affix ſuch ideas to every word that can be made uſe of to expreſs an evil diſpoſition of mind, as to make an innocent thing of it;—a kind of dead weight, which, either they make themſelves as eaſy as they can under, knowing they muſt bear it; or elſe are ſtriving with all their might to ſhake off, but can't. The ſeeking ſinner, at leaſt, is ſuppoſed to have as ſincere an inclination to become truly good, and to have a heart to do his duty, as a ſick man has to be well. His <hi>wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> his <hi>deſires,</hi> and <hi>endeavours</hi> are all very good. All he wants is to be directed how, or to have ſtrength enough to be able, to get a good heart. Thus
<q>deceitful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things,</q>
is the heart of a ſinner! Thus art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in hiding itſelf, and keeping out of ſight, and laying all blame ſomewhere elſe! The <hi>heart,</hi> the <hi>diſpoſition,</hi> the <hi>inclination,</hi> the <hi>will,</hi> are readily allow'd to be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wrong and ſinful, while yet what is properly meant by all thoſe words, is ſtill ſuppoſed to be good enough; and hence the ſinner can't ſee how he is to blame. Yea the very thing for which alone any one <hi>can</hi> be to blame, is look'd upon as his ſufficient excuſe and juſtification. Thus "a deceived heart hath turned him aſide, that he cannot deliver his ſoul, nor ſay, Is there not a lie in my right hand?"</p>
            <p n="4">4. WE may hence learn, what alone is ſufficient to convince a man that his utter impotence does not leſſen his obligation in any meaſure, or afford him the leaſt cloak for his ſins. It is only his being made ſenſible what his impotence really is, and wherein it conſiſts.
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:011467_0061_0F832F679BEF0040"/>
The apoſtle Paul ſays, Rom. vii. 8, 9.
<q>Without the law ſin was dead. For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, ſin reviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and I died.</q>
The former of theſe ſituations of the apoſtle, is that of every ſinner who can't ſee how it is poſſible he ſhould be wholly helpleſs, and yet altogether inexcuſable, at the ſame time, and in the ſame reſpect. He has no juſt conviction of
<q>the plague of his own heart,</q>
He is alive, and ſin is dead. He ſees neither his impotence, nor his ſin, in a true light. If he ſaw <hi>one,</hi> he would neceſſarily ſee <hi>both.</hi> Let an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate ſinner only ſee his <hi>real</hi> heart, and he will ſee that he is helpleſs enough. And let him only ſee <hi>this ſort</hi> of helpleſsneſs, and he will never have a thought of it's being of the nature of an excuſe. A man never finds himſelf utterly helpleſs in this view, utterly unable to become good, by reaſon of his actual badneſs, until he finds all the bottom ſprings and principles of action within him, are intirely wrong. That he does not ſo much as <hi>intend</hi> to do his duty, as duty, and never did. That he does not <hi>mean well,</hi> in any thing he does. This makes him ſee that his plowing is ſin, and that all his moſt painful religious duties, muſt be an abomination to him who looketh on the heart, and knows what they all ſpring from. He ſees he has no regard for God's glory, cares nothing what becomes of it, if <hi>he</hi> could but be ſafe and happy himſelf. He ſees <hi>he is dead,</hi> and all his works are <hi>dead works</hi>; and that he muſt be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated a-new, or he ſhall never do any thing as he ought. But does this view of his deadneſs, make him looſe ſight of his ſinfulneſs and guilt? does he now feel himſelf excuſed and free from blame, becauſe his heart is ſo totally depraved, ſo oppoſite to God and all that is good? No. Sin revives, juſt as faſt as he dies. His deadneſs is ſeen to be nothing but the very life and ſoul of ſin. His <hi>having</hi> ſuch a heart, his <hi>being</hi> of ſuch a temper, that he can do nothing, can delight in nothing
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:011467_0062_0F832F6866EDD200"/>
but ſin, he ſees is the very thing that God's law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns him to everlaſting burnings for, and that moſt juſtly. If ſuch a diſpoſition as he finds himſelf now to be of, would extenuate a creatures guilt, there is not a devil in hell that could ever be damn'd.—When a ſinner once ſees what he really is, his helpleſneſs and his ſin, are ſeen quite conſiſtent; and one juſt as great as the other. For indeed, they are <hi>one and the ſame thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. FROM what has been ſaid it may eaſily be ſeen, that there is no want of <hi>directions</hi> proper to be given to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but that all the difficulty is, they are not in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to regard and follow them. People are always ready to aſk, but after all, what ſhall ſinners do? can you give them any directions how to get out of this helpleſs condition? is there <hi>any thing for them do,</hi> or is there not?—Now this; however common it is, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly very impertinent. If it is a ſettled point, that the caſe with ſinners is, they have no heart to do any thing that is good, people muſt ſtrongly forget them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to aſk, is there any thing for them do? as if all the difficulty lay in anſwering this queſtion, or in point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out <hi>duty</hi> to them! ſurely there is enough to be done, if they would but do it. It is eaſy to direct them to the courſe they <hi>ought</hi> to take; and it would be eaſy to put them in a way in which they might have great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to hope for ſalvation, if they thought it a matter worth taking pains about, and were of a teachable ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and willing to follow good advice. It is much eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſay what they <hi>ſhould</hi> do, than it is to make them willing to do it. They <hi>ſhould</hi> become ſerious, &amp; thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful about eternal things. They <hi>ſhould</hi>
               <q>amend their ways and their doings,</q>
which are not good. They <hi>ſhould</hi> "ſearch the ſcriptures," and take every method, improve every opportunity in their power, to acquaint themſelves with God—and Jeſus Chriſt—the law—the goſpel—and with their own character and ſtate. They ſhould
<q>cry after knowledge, and lift up their voice for underſtandidg:</q>
They ſhould
<q>ſeek it as <hi>ſilver,</hi> and

                  <hi>ſearch</hi> for it as for hid treaſure.</q>
They ſhould lie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to conviction, and be willing to know the truth, and to embrace it when diſcover'd. They ſhould not cover their ſins, but be ſenſible of, humbly confeſs, and heartily forſake them. They <hi>ſhould,</hi> "return unto the Lord" their Maker and rightful Sovereign, ſubmiting to his authority, owning his juſtice, and accepting his grace through the Mediator. Or, in other words, they SHOULD repent, and believe the goſpel.</p>
            <p>BUT if they will not follow theſe, nor any good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections that can be given them, who can help it? If they will ſet at nought all the counſel of wiſdom, what good can the beſt counſel do them? If they will not hearken to the calls of the goſpel, will not come unto Chriſt that they might have life; will do nothing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be done by perſons in their circumſtances, there is, abſolutely no help for them: unleſs God himſelf inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and

            <p n="6">6. According to what has been ſaid, there can be no reaſonable objection againſt God's giving no encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſalvation, on lower terms than an actual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the goſpel. Many are ready to ſay, if there are no promiſes (or encouragements amounting to the ſame thing) on any terms ſhort of ſaving faith, God is not in earneſt in his propoſals to ſinners, and does not treat them well, but rather trifles with and mocks them in their miſery; for he knows that no unregenerate ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner can come up to ſuch terms, any more than he can make a world. But according to what has been ſaid, if ſinners were but in <hi>earneſt themſelves</hi> about their ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; if they were diſpot'd to <hi>treat God well,</hi> and not to <hi>mock</hi> and <hi>trifle with him,</hi> there would be no difficulty in the caſe. There <hi>were natural impoſſibilities</hi> in the way of our obtaining ſalvation. But <hi>Chriſt</hi> has removed every thing of <hi>this kind</hi> out of the way. He has paid the dreadful debt of ſuffering which we could never pay;
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:011467_0064_0F832F69D714B4E8"/>
and has wrought out an all-perfect righteouſneſs for out juſtification, which mere creatures, having once tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs'd, could never do. And now he ſays,
<q>Aſk, and it ſhall be given you: Seek, and ye ſhall find: Knock, and it ſhall be opened unto you. For every one that aſketh, receiveth; and he that ſeeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it ſhall be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</q>
Paſt ſins are no bar in the way; for there is "a fountain ſet open," not only
<q>for Judah and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</q>
but for all the world
<q>to waſh in, from ſin and from uncleanneſs.</q>
The greateſt unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is no objection; for the invitation is,
<q>Ho, every one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come buy and eat, yea, come, buy wine and milk, without money, and without price. <hi>Whoſoever will,</hi> let him come, and take the water of life freely.</q>
Sinners, you have really as fair an opportunity for life, according to the goſpel, as probationers can poſſibly have; as full a price in your hands, as your hearts can poſſibly deſire. There is nothing on earth; there is nothing in all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of heaven; there is nothing in all the malice and power of hell, that can hinder your ſalvation, if you don't hinder it yourſelves. Nor need you be diſcouraged by reaſon of any bad diſpoſition brought upon you by Adam, which you are heartily ſorry for, and would be glad to git rid of, but can't. For the <hi>Second Adam</hi> is able to help you in this, as well as other reſpects; and will do it in a moment, if you in the leaſt degree really deſire it. The very thing he came for was to ſave from ſin, the power, as well as the guilt of it; and to ſave whoever wants to be thus ſaved. This was the very reaſon his name was called <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Nor need you imagine, that you muſt lay out all your own ſtrength firſt, and do all that can reaſonably be required of one under your circumſtances; and then may have juſt an <hi>encouragement</hi> of being ſaved of <hi>grace</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="unknown:011467_0065_0F832F6A9E31C068"/>
after a life of ſuch perfection. This is the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful idea of the God of all grace, that you can poſſibly entertain. No. If you do ſo well that it would be hard for God to refuſe you ſalvation, he will ſave you moſt righteouſly, and never deſire you ſhould <hi>pretend</hi> to think there is any grace in it. But he will receive you <hi>graciouſly,</hi> and love you <hi>freely,</hi> if you deſire it, though you have not done ſo very well. He means to exerciſe as much grace, as he would have the honor of, and not to be eternally praiſed for what is not his real due. He is willing to ſave you in as gracious a manner as ever you thought of, or can wiſh for. Only weigh the matter, and ſay whether you chooſe to be ſaved. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the nature of goſpel-ſalvation; attend to the character and laws of Chriſt. And then ſay, whether you will have <hi>him</hi> and be <hi>his</hi>; whether you are willing, and would really chuſe to exchange the ſervitude of ſatan, for that liberty wherewith Chriſt makes his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers free; or whether you muſt plainly ſay, you love your old maſter and your luſts, and chuſe rather, to have your ear bored, and be a ſervant forever. But, however,
<q>be ſure of this, that the kingdom of God is come high unto you;</q>
and if you freely refuſe to have any part or lot in it, be aſſured, that when the wicked are turned into hell, with all the nations that forget God, it will be more tolerable for <hi>Sodom</hi> than for you. But I muſt not enlarge further, by way of particular inference.</p>
            <p>ON the whole; I am not able to conceive how any one who enters into the matter, can queſtion the propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of making the diſtinction inſiſted on in theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes; or with what appearance of reaſon, any can pretend it is a uſeleſs diſtinction. As to the importance of it; it may eaſily be obſerved, in how many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, upon the moſt leading points, and in the moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial reſpects, by the help of this diſtinction, common ſenſe will croſs the common notions of ſinners, exactly

where the bible croſſes them.—It ſets reaſon, and ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, divine juſtice, and divine grace, in a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent view; whereas without it, I apprehend they muſt forever appear irreconcilable.—It leads good men to ſee that human infirmities and imperfections, are not ſuch comfortable extenuations of guilt, as they are ſometimes ready to make of them. That all their <hi>moral</hi> infirmity, all their want of <hi>perfect holineſs,</hi> is intirely their own fault; and what they ought to be deeply humbled for, and go mourning under all their days —It ſhows ſinners, that their perdition is really al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together of themſelves: That all ground of diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement in their caſe, is their own badneſs. And not their unworthineſs, neither, but merely their <hi>unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to be made clean. That this indeed makes their caſe deſperate, from every other quarter but the unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted grace of God.

And as to changing the hearts of ſuch, God has reſerved it as the ſovereign prerogative of the throne of his grace, to

—It adminiſters not ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, indeed, to ſinners in their impenitence and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, as they would be glad to have. But in this awful condition, they have generally comfort enough, and too much in all reaſon. To kill their ſelf-righteous hopes, and let them ſee their guilt and danger, their utter helpleſneſs, and yet entire inexcuſableneſs, is the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thing that can be done for them. <note n="*" place="bottom">This, however, is the grand objection; the grand reaſon why it is ſaid, it does no good, it comes to the ſame thing when all is done and ſaid. The ſinner is as helpleſs, and as abſolutely dependent on ſovereign grace, if his inability lies in his diſpoſition, as if any thing elſe was the matter with him. For a wicked heart will as infallibly ſhut a man out of heaven, if he is left to it, as any thing in the world could. —Hence very ingenius writers, even tho' they make the diſtinction now inſiſted on and by their firſt expreſſions one would think ſaw the difference, will yet ſuppoſe after all, that the terms of ſalvation muſt be level to the <hi>hearts</hi> of men; or that <hi>ſomething</hi> muſt be done, whereby ſinners <hi>may</hi> be ſaved, notwithſtanding their <hi>moral</hi> impotence. That things muſt not be left ſo, that even
<q>his own iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelf, and be ſhall be <hi>holden</hi> in the cords of his ſins.</q>
—To ſay that if ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is offered to all who heartily deſire and chuſe it, and ſo truly aſk for it, it is offered on the loweſt terms is therefore treated with contempt; and it is replied, then we may well ſay, wo to the ſinner whoſe confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his own ſincerity fails him. If a man has not this hearty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and can't create it in himſelf he is in a deplorable condition. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the ſcriptures are ranſack'd for encouragements, if not promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, to ſomething lower than aſking for ſalvation, or being willing to have it.

               <pb n="68" facs="unknown:011467_0067_0F832F6C21661068"/>1. WE have ſeen the <hi>bible</hi> is as expreſs and full in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the difference ſuppoſed, as it is in any thing. We have ſeen that all the heart, ſoul, mind and ſtrength; that is, a perfectly willing and faithful exertion of all our faculties, however enfeebled they are, is all that God requires of us in his perfect law. Nor is there a ſingle inſtance of a natural impoſſibility's being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of any man, in all the ſacred records. Nor is it once intimated, that natural impoſſibilities <hi>might</hi> juſtly be required of us, becauſe our natural powers were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired by the fall. But, on the other hand, we have ſeen that the moſt abſolute <hi>moral</hi> impoſſibilities are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of all men, without the leaſt ſcruple, as if there was no kind of difficulty in them. That a perfect heart and a perfect life, are as much required of men now, as if they were not fallen creatures; and required of the greateſt ſinner, as much as of the beſt ſaint. No pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar proviſe's are made, in favour of even the moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd.' Nor is it once intimated, any where in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the reaſon why men may be required to do that which is lawful and right, tho' it is contrary to their
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:011467_0068_0F832F6CDA0E1EC8"/>
inclination, is becauſe Adam did that which was unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and wrong, contrary to <hi>his</hi> inclination. Or that all the reaſon why a wicked heart, is not intirely innocent, and a good excuſe, is becauſe man brought it upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by his own folly and wickedneſs, before he had any thing of it.—We have ſeen, that the way our Saviour took to convince men, their rejection of him and his goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel was their ſin, was by ſhewing them, it could proceed from nothing but the badneſs of their hearts; and not by leading them to believe it was primarily owing to a mere weakneſs or diſorder in their <hi>underſtandings,</hi> occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by the original fall. He readily admitted that if men were blind, or if they had not ſufficient means of information and conviction, their unbelief would be no ſin. But when he could prove to them that it could be owing to nothing but their hating the light, becauſe their deeds were evil, this he ſuppos'd fairly implied their condemnation, and left them no cloak for their ſin. Nor does it appear that any unbelievers in thoſe times, had refin'd ſo far as to reply in their own vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that they could not help hating the light, becauſe their hearts were evil. This ſeems to be a cloak for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, of a more modern invention.</p>
            <p n="2">2. WE have ſeen that <hi>common ſenſe,</hi> moſt readily and fully giv<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> into ſuch a difference as this, in all common caſes; in every ſuppoſable caſe in which the vindication of our own character is not concerned. Yea in caſes where men are moſt intereſted, and moſt ſtraitned for a plea in their own juſtification, they rarely think of plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a bad intention, and a very wicked heart. If a man, when queſtion'd for a ſuppoſed faulty action, can ſhew that it was an overſight, and not owing to any ill deſign; or if he can make appear, that he had not opportunity or capacity, to do better than he did; theſe, are always allow'd to be things to his purpoſe. But it is rare that any one undertakes to excuſe himſelf, as to any injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conduct, or omiſſion of duty, with reſpect to his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low men, by ſhewing that he is, and always was, of an
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:011467_0069_0F832F6D94967A30"/>
exceeding wicked and unrighteous diſpoſition, and that has <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> was quite as bad as his <hi>conduct.</hi> No one, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he was out of his wits, would ever think of making ſuch a plea as this before a human court. It is only in matters of religion, and before the divine tribunal, on their laſt, deciſive trial, that criminals themſelves think of making this plea, or that it would avail any thing, unleſs to their greater condemnation.</p>
            <p>AND we have ſeen, that the reaſon why ſinners are ready to look upon a wicked heart as a good excuſe in matters of religion, is becauſe they <hi>mean</hi> no ſuch thing by it, nor do they think they <hi>have</hi> any ſuch thing as, a heart at all wicked. When they talk of moral depravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, deadneſs in ſin, want of a diſpoſition to that which is good, &amp;c. They really mean by ſuch expreſſions—they know not what. Something that is conſiſtent with their <hi>ſincerely</hi> wiſhing, deſiring, and <hi>endeavouring</hi> to the utmoſt of their natural power, to do their whole duty. And this is all the reaſon they think a bad heart is an excuſe with reſpect to theſe things, any more than in other caſes. This is the reaſon why, in their view, "ſin is dead," and looks like ſuch a kind of thing as muſt neceſſarily be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways dead; it not being poſſible in the nature of things that it ſhould be alive, longer than only juſt to bring itſelf into exiſtence!</p>
            <p>IT may therefore, notwithſtanding this ſeeming ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, well be conſidered as a quite univerſal dictate of common ſenſe; that the want of a heart, and the want of natural capacity, in regard to excuſing men, are intirely different things.</p>
            <p n="3">3. WE have ſeen, that <hi>reaſon</hi> diſcovers a juſt founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for this deciſion of the moral ſenſe, and of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as clearly as it diſcovers any thing of a moral na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. We have ſeen that an ability to act otherways than agreeably to our own hearts, would only be an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to act unfreely and of conſtraint. That actions which <hi>may</hi> be done contrary to, or without our wills, are actions for which <hi>we</hi> cannot in reaſon be accountable.
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:011467_0070_0F832F6E530EE030"/>
That only taking away moral neceſſity, the neceſſity of men's acting or not acting, according to their own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and choice, unavoidably ſubjects then to a fatal neceſſity, a neceſſity of acting otherways than they would chuſe, or whether they will or no. Reaſon plainly teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, that things done under that neceſſity which ariſes from our own hearts, and that which is againſt them, are juſt as different, as things in which <hi>we</hi> are the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, and things in which we are not:—Juſt as differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent as Peter's girding himſelf when he was young, and going whither he would, and his being girded after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and carried whether he would not:—Juſt as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent as a man's wilfully murdering himſelf, and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing murdered by another, in ſpite of all he could do in his own defence.—We have ſeen, that if want of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs excuſes a perſon in being unholy, and if a diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſin excuſes a perſon in ſinning, then every unholy creature, every ſinner in the univerſe, is perfectly excuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>THUS if <hi>ſcripture, reaſon,</hi> and <hi>common-ſenſe,</hi> all concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the fulleſt manner, can confirm any thing, an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential difference betwixt natural and moral inability, the inability which ariſes from our own hearts, and that ariſing from any other quarter, is moſt fully confirmed. Nor can any one ſay that theſe two kinds of <hi>can't,</hi> come to the ſame thing, as to excuſing men, without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting the <hi>higheſt degree,</hi> of <hi>every kind</hi> of evidence we can have, of any moral truth.—"He that hath an ear, let him hear."</p>
