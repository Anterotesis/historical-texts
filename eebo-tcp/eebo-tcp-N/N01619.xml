         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Prayer is the breathing forth of holy Deſires, or, lifting up the Soul unto God, or asking the Things we need from God, in and by Chriſt, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to His Holy Will, not without Confeſſions, and Thanksgiving. This Work muſt have Time, Seriouſneſs, Compoſure: And this take undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly, <hi>That Prayers can never fly high, where the Perſon is not accepted; can have no ſtrength without Faith:</hi> About this Duty, I muſt let you know, There are Three Miſcarriages uſually.</p>

You need to take a time when He is moſt like to hear, even when He is inditing for you, and puts <hi>Words into your mouth,</hi> Hoſ. 14.</p>

Oh, how many ſay their Prayers backwards, call Him Father, who is not their Father, would not have His Name Hallowed, nor His Kingdom Come? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>But ſince I promiſed the Addition of my <hi>Experience</hi> to your Self, I have held that very true, noted by <hi>David:</hi> yea, by ſome Heathens, That <hi>our Life is Seventy Years:</hi> half of which time ſpends it ſelf in Eating, Drinking, and Sleeping: the Remainder is <hi>Thirty Five:</hi> and of that you may allow the firſt <hi>Fifteen,</hi> even for Child-hood till when ordinarily little is minded that is ſolid: then <hi>Twenty</hi> only are left of the Number, and of them even half ſpent in by-buſineſs: and then tell me how little do we live? How needful is it then that you be upon your Watch continually, when ſo many Silver Brooks run by many Doors un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded.</p>
            <p>It is hard to Watch, moſt are very Drowſie: The Diſciples themſelves could not Watch One Hour.</p>

               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:001923_0015_0FBA1CD3E076C698"/>My Advice is, That mainly <hi>you Watch your ſelf in what you are, And where you are:</hi> Theſe Two go far in your Watch; to ſee your ſelf in a good Eſtate; And to be where you ſhould be in your Duty and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, argues a curious Eye, and a careful Head: But to be very accurate in your Watch, and to keep off from troubleſome Annears, keep a Book by you (I mean it literally) in which, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Night before you ſleep, you ſet down on the one ſide, the Lords gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Providence and Dealings with you; and your Dealings with Him on the other ſide: This Watch well kept, ſits for Prayer, Faſtings, Sabbath, Sacraments, and Death; upon which Judgment follows.</p>
            <p>I pray Watch ſo, That <hi>Thoughts, Affections, Head, Heart, Hand, Foot,</hi> and all have a ſhare in, and benefit by the Work.</p>
            <p>The Fleſh and the World, in all the Pleaſures and Profits of them, ſend up fumes to the Head, occaſioning ſleep: Therefore the Lord is forced to keep us waking by Affliction, as the Thorn to the Singing Bird. <hi>David</hi> ſought God
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001923_0016_0FBA1CD56F6A5228"/>
early: The Three Women early look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after Chriſt. <hi>Remember thy Creator</hi> betimes. And this <hi>Watching,</hi> is the <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect Walking,</hi> Epheſ. 5.16. Look round about you continually, as if you <hi>Walked with God</hi> as <hi>Enoch, before God</hi> as <hi>Abraham:</hi> or, <hi>after God,</hi> as <hi>David:</hi> he walked in Gods Ways. If you do not <hi>Watch,</hi> you will be <hi>Tempted,</hi> I ſay, <hi>Tempted.</hi> The Lord Watch over thee, that thou mayeſt Watch (my deareſt Child.)</p>
            <p n="6">6. For thy growth in Grace, I am the more zealous, becauſe (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.8.) the Apoſtle propounded it as a Cure againſt all the <hi>Errors of the wicked.</hi> For this alſo there are divers helps, as M. <hi>Symmons</hi> his Cure to <hi>Distreſſed Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> (a Choice Piece) and many others. But this you muſt know, that all la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour tends not to growth; no more than Ants grow in bulk, though very much in labour; Every great Hearer is not a great Grower: Nay, a tree may grow in parts, though not in all. Grow ſoundly in the Root <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Freeneſs</hi> of his Grace, and then you will not grow as Weeds do, but
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001923_0017_0FBA1CD796785990"/>
as good Grain. To which purpoſe I adviſe you, to obſerve what you gain againſt Corruption, and ſo much you may hope, you may thrive in Grace; as the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and the Houſe of <hi>Saul.</hi> Do not therefore keep the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Counſel; but let ſome able Friend <hi>Watch</hi> you, to whom communicate your Decays or Growth. When a Ship is obſerved by a Land-mark, her way is eaſily obſerved. Therefore mind much this one thing, in all make much of a Rule, and keep to it; as few under the warm Goſpel but know whether they be Hypocrites or otherwiſe. Even ſo you ſhall feel your Growth. An old ſtock will not ſerve turn (which hath been the deluſion of many) when every day needs new Incomes of the Spirit, and ſo advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Heaven.</p>
            <p>Long to grow, ſtrive to grow; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail decayes: grow in both the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles Duties.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle tells us of growth from Vertue; yea, at laſt to Patience by Affliction, if we hear the Rod, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſts method is, He hath all Grace. He giveth out what He pleaſeth; He
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001923_0018_0FBA1CDE56D72330"/>
maintains what He gives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He perfects what He maintains; He Crowns what He perfects: And thus Chriſt loves you, more than ever you could hate Him, without whoſe watering by His Blood you can never grow. The beſt Evidence of Growth, is to grow more Humble, more Holy, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that well: and ſee how it is from Meal to Meal, from one Sabbath to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, one Sermon to another: are you fed or ſurfeited? A very very little Grace (if true) is ſaving: a little Growth (if right) is comforting: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and Live, Believe and Grow; all decayes come through want of Faith: to fetch Blood from the Life Vein, the Lord Chriſt. The South and North blow upon thee for Growth (my Child.)</p>
            <p n="7">7. In all things as you will have uſe: ſo you need to ſtudy Conſcience well, for it Eats, Drinks, Walks, Sleeps, Buys, Sells, accompanies you to every Duty, Service, Work, Doing, or Suffering; for which you have <hi>Ames</hi> his <hi>Caſes,</hi> and ſome others.</p>

               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:001923_0019_0FBA1CDFC0D7ED58"/>It is a judging your ſelf according to the judgment of God.</p>
            <p>I Write none of theſe Heads to you, as intending any common place, which this and others would make; but only to leave with you a few practical thoughts upon each.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour made the <hi>Jews</hi> to buy a Knife to cut their own Throats, when he told them the Parable of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and Son, ſent and killed: and ſo the Spirit by the <hi>Jews,</hi> Iſai. 5. when he made them impannel a Jury among themſelves, and by Conſcience their Judge: So <hi>Nathan</hi> by <hi>David,</hi> it is a Witneſs with a Witneſs, and Judge Paramount: therefore I wiſh you to obſerve it narrowly, if you ſuffer it to be defiled with the leaſt Sin, whilſt it hath Life you may hear of it; and therefore <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> in all, kept all clear there; the leaſt filth muſt be waſht out by the Blood of Chriſt: <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> paid dear for it; <hi>Cains</hi> Building, and <hi>Sauls</hi> Harping, will do but little to cure it; it may be quiet and good, unquiet and good, and ſo on the other hand; but this I have noted, that falſe Lights or dim ones, have helpt much
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001923_0020_0FBA1CE20551ADD8"/>
to the violation of it: preſent things and the out-ſides of things, have alſo broke in upon it: and in Sinning, whether the wound be in the Head or Conſcience firſt, is a queſtion, but not hardly reſolved.</p>
            <p>Your wiſdom will be to live upon a directing Word: and then Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will make a ſoft Bed for you in your greateſt ſorrow: <hi>A wounded Conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience who can bear?</hi> Go to our firſt Parent, and he will tell you ſo, who might have gathered fruit to eat, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than leaves to cover himſelf.</p>
            <p>Do not grieve Conſcience twice, it muſt be your beſt Friend, yea, when Friends, and World, and all leave you to ſolitarineſs.</p>
            <p>If it whimper a little, do not make it roar out: and yet do not ſtiffle it, but attend it, and carry it up to <hi>Mount Cavalry</hi> for peace.</p>
            <p>Remember, a good Conſcience and Sin cannot live together: Let but this Bird ſing ſweetly within, and let Heaven and Earth come together, thou ſhalt be ſafe, (my poor Child.)</p>

Next I am to remember you, that you have much work to do in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time: which calls you up to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as the Day the Lark, and the Lark the Husbandman; <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12. the whole Chapter: I hope you have it.</p>
            <p>About Redemption of time, you have many Treatiſes. The greateſt of your work in your ſhort time, is to get Chriſt, and live upon Him, and to Him; And this is the life of Faith, which you can never live, unleſs Faith have to live upon it ſelf, which will digeſt nothing but Word, and Promiſes: Therefore now you are Young, lay in a good Stock for Faith to live on; but you muſt do it ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably; you are Young I ſay, and may have a little time before you, which certainly hath Eternity hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it; called a Race, a Day, or Hour: the Old World had their Day, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a Day, the Goſpel is called the Day of Grace: Therefore lay in ſeaſonably; and not only ſo, but abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, for your Market may be at the higheſt; Fooliſh Virgins had Oyl in their Lamps, none in their Veſſels: <hi>Store is no Sore;</hi> for you know not
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001923_0022_0FBA2D3137EF84E0"/>
what Promiſes you may need, for Want, for Reproach, for Sickneſs and Death.</p>
            <p>The Kingdom of Heaven muſt ſuffer Violence: Violent Faith, Love, Prayer, muſt ſtorm it.</p>
            <p>The time will come when wiſhes will not help; your own Works and Righteouſneſs will fail.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Lay up your ſtock for Faith conveniently, that you may reach a Word when you need it moſt. Ah that you would be wiſe! Ask your heart at Night, what you have done that Day in this Point, becauſe every Night may be your laſt.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſecure your Principles, walk up to the Compaſs of every Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, clear your Evidences, keep cloſe Communion with God, Look out to growing Evils, and fit for them; And theſe are the work of your Generation. I ſay, it is your work, you may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier make bars to the Sea, and order the Influences of Heaven, then call back yeſterday.</p>
            <p>Therefore Work and Pray, Repent, Believe, get Aſſurances of Heaven to Day, I ſay, to Day, and be happy for ever, <hi>(Dear Child.)</hi>

            <p>Conſtitution, Age, Experience, Parts, Afflictions, Fulneſs, Honour, Glory, will all ſay, We have it not; Crowns have it not; and Beggars want it: I was about to ſay, it is only in Heaven.

            <p>Firſt, All your under-moon Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or Comforts, are too ſhort, and too narrow Beds for Content to lye in.</p>

            <p>Content muſt have ſomething to anſwer all the defects of the Creature; and it only dwells where all Queſtions are fully anſwered, ſpringing from thence.</p>
            <p>A Naked Soul meeting with a Naked Chriſt, can only be quieted in Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals, and the ſame Chriſt improved alſo for Temporals: Sin is pardoned, Iniquities and Corruptions done away; the Favour of God gained<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Spirit bearing Witneſs to Adoption, anſwers all; for to this you muſt roul at length.

of a Friend, which moſt want; and laſtly, muſt have Faithfulneſs, the great ingredient: if ſuch an one you can find, you ſhall enjoy their Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences freely, you ſhall conſtantly be carried to God in their Prayers, you ſhall have ſympathy and help in your troubles: The Spirit of Chriſt is a healing ſaving Spirit, and ſuch is theirs: To ſuch open your heart clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who will never upbraid you for Confeſſions; and know when Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations ſhake, you will need a Maſter-builder or Workman, ſuch is a good Friend and wiſe. To get ſuch an one, muſt be your care; and to keep, muſt be your diligence: Walk not unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the mercy if you gain it. Kinſman will not make it, no nor a Brother, though born for Adverſity. Your hopes may be thoſe, if the Lord promiſe; <hi>When your wayes pleaſe Him, your Enemies ſhall be at peace with you.</hi> He can raiſe a Friend, and Himſelf be your beſt Friend: To whom I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you, dear Child.</p>

and works, ſomething I muſt adviſe you about it from Experience, though many Books are written about it: as Mr. <hi>Goodwyns Sinfulneſs of Sin, &amp;c.</hi> Yet two things take from me: Be marvellous careful it break not in: Secondly, as diligent to drive it out ſpeedily. And for the former, <hi>Gonge</hi> and <hi>Gurnal</hi> I commend, about the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the whole Armour, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. Sin is a breach of the Law, <hi>and the ſtrength of Sin is the Law</hi> from that breach, the Soul being as well left to Sin the Keeper, as to Satan the Jaylor, by the Fall, and nothing but the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of Chriſt, put in to Divine Juſtice, can remit the Authority of it; yea, though the power and filth in part be taken away by Sanctification, yet it will break in again, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and will at leaſt get ſome out-room, as Pride in Cloaths, Cozenage in Dealings, Luſt in the Eye, Paſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and bad work it makes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is; Oh keep it at ſtaves length: <hi>Peter, David, Heman</hi> and others ever crack under it: As you cannot build your Reformation upon unrepented Sin; ſo you ſhould not make daily work
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:001923_0045_0FBA2D6F4545CAE0"/>
for Repentance, by admitting Sin, which muſt be reformed. Therefore to prevent this miſchief, you muſt exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe hatred againſt it, as againſt an Enemy that cut the throat, or would, of your beſt Friends, and yours alſo, and purſue it with a deadly feud; hate it in all the ſtock and linage of it, my Child.</p>
            <p>A little Sin is Sin, down with it, keep your guard, and hate it in all the forrage that may maintain ſuch an Enemy: I mean, in the occaſions leading to it: in which I might be large. On with all your Armour ſpeedily: and when you find it hath beſpotted you, do as a good houſwife with her Linnen, get a Waſhing-day, I mean a Faſting-day, out with it by hand, laver, bucking; if it be a ſtain that gets through and through, it will out the next Spring for bleaking, I mean, a Sin premeditated as <hi>Davids:</hi> a few common tears will not help there, but extraordinary, and the Blood of Chriſt above all. Ask the Damned what they ail? Sin, Sin, they cry. Ask the diſtreſſed Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:001923_0046_0FBA2D706A4A9960"/>
Sin too. Ask the Afflicted? Sin. <hi>For the Bulruſh will not grow without mire.</hi> That which croſſes the Law of God, make thy greateſt croſs; that which divides you from the beſt Good, call your worſt Evil. It made Chriſt to bleed, to groan, to die. The Lord ſprinkle thy Conſcience with the Blood of the Everlaſting Covenant, that you may not Sin to Death, My dear Child.</p>
            <p n="19">19. And next (becauſe bordering upon what went before) I would add a caſe, which ſo often, even choice Chriſtians are incumbred with, and that is, Their queſtioning all their works after many years Experience and Profeſſion; and their Objections, many againſt themſelves; as from Sins before Converſion, in Converſion, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it; repeated Sins, againſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Mercy, Light, Means; yea, even cutting Purſes under the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; againſt all Examples, and what not? Nay, it cannot ſtand with Gods honour to ſave, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.8. anſwers all.</p>

               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:001923_0047_0FBA2D71D46E1A40"/>This therefore I would have you know, that though it be not ſafe to dig at Foundations often, leſt we ſhake the Building; ſo our great care is to have ſound Foundations to build upon, which in the general is Chriſt, and other none can lay. Make quick work, and ſee you be in Chriſt, and offer your Evidences to a diſcerning Friend, or more; and know, that God hath limited his tenders of Grace to a day of this Life, of the Goſpel, and of Conſcience awakened; therefore look out whilſt it is <hi>To day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Put by Spiritual ſloth, Cares of this World, boſom Corruptions, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may hinder; God is not bound to your limitings: Were it not from His Mercy, and to leave every Soul inexcuſable, why ſhould the Lord give any time of Grace?

            </p>
            <p>Your delays rob your Soul long of Comfort, and you keep your ſelf the longer out of Chriſt's Service. The nature of Sin is poiſon, do not ſtay till

I add hereunto your Caſe, under croſs Providences: yea, ſuch as where Promiſes ſeem to ſpeak one thing, and Providence another; Under which the beſt Saints have had great and ſtrange ſinkings of ſpirit; For which you have <hi>Sibbs, Burrows,</hi> and others to help.</p>
            <p>My poor thoughts alſo are theſe for Caſe and Cure; When <hi>Job</hi> faints, <hi>Job</hi> 4.5. When <hi>David</hi> chides his ſoul, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. When <hi>Heman</hi> is even diſtracted, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.15. <hi>Jacob</hi> will not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.35. and ſo divers. This great Diſſertion ſprings from ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the overweening ſome Comforts we enjoy, our overvaluing them breeds much trouble in the loſs of them: So <hi>David</hi> with his <hi>Abſolom;</hi> or from the ſurpriſal being ſudden and unexpected; a priſon at firſt uncouth, in time eaſie and ſweet; where a mortified heart grows ſuited to it: (to this I could ſpeak much) or elſe it may ſpring from ſome ſecret weight God may put into this Change of Providence, which we are not aware of; and ſo the ſcale grows heavy with ſome Lead hanging at the bottom unſeen: a ſmall thing
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:001923_0050_0FBA2D7C4EABC0A8"/>
troubles more than a greater: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer we apply to our own ſtrength in it, but for the other to Gods. Or laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it may ſpring from the Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſelf; As when the Croſs is heavy, or multiplied, or of long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, or toucheth ſome noble part; as wounds that touch the Liver, Heart, Brain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay, I muſt tell you, when we make our Caſe worſe than God doth, as by our refuſing the Lords Comforts, which <hi>Jacob</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. or where we let looſe the Reins of Paſſion, as <hi>David, On my ſon, my ſon! &amp;c.</hi> Or when we drown all our preſent Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in that one croſs Providence, which is too near the ſpirit of <hi>Haman,</hi> who croſs by <hi>Moraecat,</hi> ſlights all his Favours at Court, and dies upon the other.</p>
            <p>Your Cure in all this will be, To be willing to want, what God is not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to give, and to know He is wife, to give what He will, how He will, and when He will: for the godly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Heart for Temporals cries, <hi>Lord, what thou wilt:</hi> and in Spirituals, <hi>When thou wilt:</hi> and in both, <hi>How thou wilt:</hi>

is good from the Hand of ſuch a Father.</p>
            <p>Your Intereſt in Chriſt, ſupplies all, and ſweetens all: but with the Doves Innocency, uſe the Serpents Wiſdom; live in daily waiting and expectation of Changes, even in your beſt and holieſt condition here: Deaths-heads, and Hour-glaſſes will be but ordinary ſignificant Ceremonies: it is within you that cruciats, or comforts: He that made the World, can change it when He will: Your Comfort will will be, that in the greateſt Storm, your Heavenly Father is at the Helm; though Sin and Satan buſsle: that Hand keep you, My dear Child.</p>
            <p n="21">21. And if you ask me (after all) what you ſhall do with your fears to which your Sex and Condition prompt you? You ſhall have what I know, though the Lord Jeſus anſwers all to His little Flock when He ſays, <hi>Fear not;</hi> yea, more particularly, <hi>Fear not them that can only kill the Body,</hi> and deſtroy that. You muſt know that your queſtion will mainly lie about baſe and unwarrantable fears, which have theſe roots: Either (when our of this fear)
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:001923_0052_0FBA2D812A0268E8"/>
you are loth to part with that the Lord would have you let go, or would part with that the Lord would have you keep; as when you wrangle about ſome Corruption, eſpecially which is dear unto you, and hath ſome great diſadvantage attending your throwing it away. Theſe kinds of fear are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with theſe miſchiefs. As you will be unwilling to know your duty, ſo you will be unwilling to practiſe it when you know it; yea, not only ſo, but (through fear) be as unable, as unwilling: like that trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling King at the hand-writing he ſaw. The inconveniences are very many, and the Sins not few that follow it. The cure in general, even for <hi>Peter,</hi> who (by it) denied his Maſter, is this, <hi>That whoever fears to ſin, never ſins by fear:</hi> and more particularly, <hi>The ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of ſome good you deſire, or the coming on of ſome evil, draws out this fear:</hi> Therefore make much of this Rule; Be ever poſſeſt of ſome good, that may anſwer the taking away of what you may loſe, which is the preſence and favour of God in Chriſt: In the night the waking Child in the Cradle is
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:001923_0053_0FBA2D84B38869D0"/>
quiet at the Nurſes coming to it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is more of comfort in the Nurſe, than fear in the dark.</p>
            <p>And then be perſwaded to ſet a right value upon all earthly, periſhing, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things; do not call a Pebble a Pearl. But above all, keep your fear in his proper channel: Oh <hi>fear God, fear God.</hi> It is not only the <hi>beginning of wiſdom,</hi> but the <hi>perfection of your joys,</hi> which kept <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and others of the Saints from Sin.</p>
            <p>My earneſt deſire for you is, That the Lord would give you an even and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual ſpirit, and the root of it, Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: <hi>That</hi> (as the Righteous) <hi>you may be bold as a Lyon,</hi> and yet <hi>rejoyce with trembling.</hi> In this good fear I leave you, My dear Child.</p>
            <p n="22">22. And if the Evil you fear, and a day of Affliction come upon you; then my counſel is, (bear with the feebleneſs of it in all) take that Rule, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.14. <hi>In that evil day,</hi> or day of your <hi>diſtreſſes,</hi> you muſt <hi>Conſider:</hi> which is (as the Word bears) by ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and diligent though fulneſs to

take things aſunder, eſpecially ſorrows and ſins: For the little Needle will draw a long tail of Thread after it: little Sins may be followed with great Sorrows, to ſet you at your work.</p>
            <p>Firſt, You muſt ſee the evil of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity in the nature of it, ſuch a plague, and ſuch a viſitation: and in the cauſes of it: As in the principal, none of that evil <hi>in the city,</hi> but from the Lord.</p>

I know, ſince the importunity of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror hath brought forth ſo many Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and occaſioned ſo much ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal to Religion the World thorow.</p>
            <p>And becauſe many have touched hereupon (as you ſee in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,) and many more <hi>Polemicks</hi> and <hi>Diſputes</hi> are Printed than profitable, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Party ſtriving their own advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; this I have ſaid, this I muſt ſay, That whoſo departs from thoſe Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals profeſt, and died upon by the Saints and Martyrs ſince the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and departure from <hi>Popery,</hi> need to have his Opinion written in Stars: for <hi>If an Angel bring another Goſpel, he or it may not be received, that ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict what we have received already from the Lord Jeſus.</hi> It is a continuing word. Oh that it might abide in us, and with us.</p>
            <p>Two things in ſuch a danger I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend unto you:</p>
            <p>Firſt, Obſerve, or ask your ſelf or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers what frame of ſpirit or heart you are in, when you receive this novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and if I miſtake not, When the heart is Proud, Lazie, or Frothy, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects communion with God, duty, and
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:001923_0057_0FBA2D8DA0CBCC38"/>
exactneſs, then a cover-cup for ſuch corruption is ſought after; then Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers underſtand nothing; then men can live without God, Ordinances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You muſt know that this work is gradual: The Ship ſails through the Channel, where ſhe may have Land on both ſides, before ſhe come to the Main, and loſeth ſight of all Land.</p>
            <p>But this you will certainly find, That if theſe People would ſpeak out, they have changed their Opinions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout God, before they change about His Ways. I could be very large in this, accounting it my very great Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that temptation never led me from that Honeſt, Old, Godly, <hi>Puritan</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the everlaſting truths of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Enquire whether they have been carried more to God and Holineſs ſince their change. For that which comes from God, will carry us to God: but if only to <hi>Pride, Cenſuring, Libertiſm, &amp;c.</hi> you know what to make of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beware of Leaven of the Phariſees,</hi> (Chriſt ſays) for <hi>Leaven</hi> will ſowre the <hi>Dough:</hi> will ſwell it, will harden
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:001923_0058_0FBA2D9480BB8BB8"/>
it, and theſe you meet with in mens ſpirits leavened with <hi>Error.</hi> Where men once leave the Rule, there will be no end of their running, till they come to <hi>Atheiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore ſtand in awe of God, and fear Him always; Hold to the Word as to Life; Queſtion not Truths: Look to your Company: Value the meaneſt Ordinance: You will need all. Be very low and humble before the Lord, and <hi>Grow in Grace,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.18. (My dear Child.)</p>
            <p n="24">24. And becauſe the firſt Child that appears in view of this <hi>Jeſabel,</hi> the Mother of Miſchief <hi>(Error)</hi> ſo called by <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 2.20. is about the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath:</hi> either wholly ſlighting it, or counting it <hi>Jewiſh:</hi> or our day not the right day, not the Seventh: yea that every day is a Sabbath, with the like: I mean beſides all ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely look upon it as a day of Sport, Pleaſure, and Vanity: I think it my duty to Charge you, (as ever you mean or hope to enjoy that everlaſting Reſt hereafter) that you would value the Sabbath. Read <hi>Dod</hi> and others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="unknown:001923_0059_0FBA2D95CC127C10"/>I do not remember that I have ever met with a truly Godly gracious Soul, that lived above or beyond this.</p>
            <p>The Firſt <hi>Commandment</hi> ſets up the true God, The Second His Worſhip according to His own Will, The Third His Reverence and Honour, and the Fourth <hi>Time,</hi> the Seventh part of <hi>Time</hi> for Him, is holy <hi>Time,</hi> Works of Neceſſity and Charity not croſſing that Holineſs.</p>
            <p>I ſay the Seventh part of <hi>Time,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is Night in one place, when Day in another; which <hi>Time</hi> begins at the Evening, as <hi>Time</hi> is diſtinguiſhed into days, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1: And though the Queſtions about the <hi>Sabbath</hi> and <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> breed much diſpute in the World, yet we muſt Study to know Gods Will in both.</p>
            <p>I muſt ſay more to you: Where the Sabbath is at an under-value in any Country, ſay it be <hi>France, Holland, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, &amp;c.</hi> there you ſhall find Religion low, and at beſt waſting it ſelf into Diſputes. But know that <hi>England</hi> (which is moſt famous for Religion) got it from the Sabbaths, upon which Day the Lord is pleaſed (as Princes by
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:001923_0060_0FBA2D975EAD9B70"/>
their <hi>Almoners</hi>) to give out His Gifts and Graces to the ſons of Men.</p>
            <p>I was a witneſs that <hi>Middleburgh</hi> in <hi>Zealand</hi> grew famous for Religion, by <hi>Teeling</hi> their Preacher fetching the keeping of the Sabbath from <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly the Fourth <hi>Commandment</hi> is the Key to all the reſt; for how ſhall the reſt be practiſed if not taught? and how taught, if not time allowed? and what time more likely to carry a Bleſſing, than Gods Appointment?</p>
            <p>It were as good to take down Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and all Ordinances, as to take down the Sabbath.</p>
            <p>The wonders of God have born wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (as <hi>Burton</hi> and others write) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Breakers of it.</p>
            <p>Wherefore look well about you, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 58.13. Love the Lord in His Sabbaths, as you would have reſt hereafter. Look to this Reſt here, and remember the Sabbath; that is, Prepare for it all the Week long, eſpecially the Evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> had two Preparations to the Sabbath, at Three, and Six.</p>
            <p>Do you keep on, and gather home all Affections to wait upon the Work,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:001923_0061_0FBA2D9B9C129988"/>
and let the day be dear to you. <hi>The God of Sabbath be yours,</hi> (dear Child.)</p>
            <p n="25">25. The Premiſes conſidered, I ſhould a little open what I mean by <hi>Free Grace,</hi> to which I ſend you ſo often for ſuccour in Caſes; and truly it hath been much ſpoken of, and as much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed, as if men from thence might take leave for any evil; and on the other hand alſo, filth caſt upon men that have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to hold it forth; for which Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi> ſuffered alſo, and ſome of that mind, who meant faithfully to the Church of Chriſt, and have written much for the abaſement of the Creature, and lifting up Grace.</p>
            <p>I wiſh we may judge right judgment of all men, and things.</p>
            <p>But a little Practically to caſt in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to profit you:</p>
            <p>The Grace ſo ſpoken of, ſhould main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be minded as the Root and Fruits of the New Covenant, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. and that in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.19, 20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which you will find lie upon two Parties, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the poor <hi>Believer;</hi> and Chriſt to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in a double Act of his:</p>
            <p>Firſt, In his loving, or rather mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:001923_0062_0FBA2D9C8F2FEC98"/>
his love, in time to the ſoul, And,</p>
            <p>Secondly, In paſſing over that Right he hath in himſelf to the believing ſoul.</p>
            <p>Anſwerable whereunto, the ſoul firſt from Chriſts love is warm'd to love again; and from his bounty in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Act, turns over all the ſoul hath to the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> whether Name, Eſtate, Wit, Parts, yea all its Intereſts.</p>
            <p>Now Chriſt thus loving the ſoul, and giving himſelf upon no Meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or procuring Cauſe on the ſouls ſide, is called <hi>Free Grace</hi> indeed; when the Father ſhall freely give his Son, and the Son freely his Heart-blood, and the Spirit freely all its operations, and make a free Covenant of grace and mercy to pardon all ſin, to receive a ſinner into his boſom, <hi>without money or price;</hi> nay not to offer any thing of his own, either Duty, or Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1. this call <hi>Free Grace:</hi> though when Chriſt comes to manifeſt this, he (by the Law) gets Parly with the ſinner he means to ſave, by ſome uncouth wayes, and often very croſs to fleſh and blood, which makes the work hard to judge of at firſt: yet be
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:001923_0063_0FBA2D9EB2CD37F0"/>
aſſured that the whole work will be Free, in the whole Frame of it.</p>
            <p>But becauſe this point is of ſuch ſingular concernment, and that I have formerly delighted to ſpeak to others touching the ſame, and would have the comfort of it my ſelf, I ſhall let you know what I know about the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the working hereof, that you miſtake not.</p>
            <p n="26">26. And in the letting you in this Light, to give you the ſum of true practical Divinity: and therefore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve with diligence, That when a diſcovery is made of this Love to the Sinnes, the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> makes a double approach to the Soul; the firſt is by the Law, where he takes three ſteps: And firſt, by the Law he ſtops the Sinner in his courſe, and makes him to ſee Sin in the very nature of it, not in the Hell only, and conſequence; but in that it ſeparates the Soul from the greateſt good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7. And, Secondly, makes the ſoul bear the burthen, and weight of it, which makes <hi>David</hi> himſelf cry out often, and ſo others: It pincheth hard where ſin hath got time and ſtrength,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:001923_0064_0FBA2DA0CB0A2048"/>
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, it lets the ſoul to know, that he is not able to ſatisfie Divine juſtice, and ſo the Law may be called a <hi>School-maſter</hi> to Chriſt though the Text leads to the <hi>Ceremonial;</hi> the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> being the Goſpel of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Theſe three ſteps of Love Chriſt takes in the Law by his firſt approach.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In his Goſpel-approach he takes theſe ſteps:</p>
            <p>Firſt, He holds forth himſelf to the ſinner, a Mediator of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and a free pardon of ſin, this keeps the ſoul from deſpair.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He lets you know that he is as able, and as willing as ever to do it, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.19. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This keeps the ſoul in heart and hope.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, By that which they call the Reflex Act, he brings home a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Promiſe of Grace to the ſoul, as <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.17. and the Spirit of Chriſt thus argues:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He that is athirſt muſt freely come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But (ſayes the Spirit) <hi>Thou art thirſty,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore come freely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I uſe to ſay:</p>
            <p>A pitiful, naſty, ragged, fatherleſs,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:001923_0065_0FBA2DA6D09A7148"/>
friendleſs Child, is lying dying in a ditch: A noble bountiful hand means to ſave him, and adopt him; firſt ſends a ſervant to awaken him, and bring him to his Court-gate; then bids another let him in, a third to waſh him, and put him on clean clothes; another to read him the Order of his Houſe; another to ſet him at Table with his Children; another to ſhew him his preſent, and future eſtate.</p>
            <p>Thus the Spirit of <hi>Humiliation</hi> firſt wakens a miſerable loſt ſinner, and that by the Law, and can only bring him to the Gate: Then <hi>Vocation</hi> opens the Door: Then <hi>Juſtification</hi> puts on Chriſts Righteouſneſs: <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> teacheth him how to walk, taking away the Power of ſin: <hi>Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> makes him a Brother, and gives him his Privileges: And <hi>Glory</hi> begun here in part, by ſanctifying, ſhews him his eſtate. And all this hath its riſe from Free Grace, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 16. For God found us in our blood.</p>
            <p>The Lord open your eyes, and make this a time of Love to you, dear Child.</p>
            <p n="27">
               <pb n="62" facs="unknown:001923_0066_0FBA2DA7D1FBB2E0"/>27. But whilſt I ſpeak to you of Free-grace, I muſt let you know that in the next Place I muſt commend unto you, accurate walking, as the fruit thereof: and for your better underſtanding, I commend unto you divers of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Books: ſo my own thoughts are, that it conſiſts in all manner of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Circumſpection, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.15. to look within you, without you, about you, beneath you, to all and every duty: and the rather, becauſe Gods eye is ever, and every where upon you: Oh that you could ſo walk, ſo think: and not only ſo, but you have bad Men obſerving, who, by your negligence, may either infeſt your Liberties, or infect you with their Evils, or at beſt be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der drawn-on to the ways of God by your careleſs example: Add hereunto, that you have the eyes of good Men upon you; and if they be Young Chriſtians, you may make the Ways of God like Giants and Brazen Walls unto them, carry much difficulty and diſcouragement with them; or, if ancient Chriſtians, you may ſend them with grief to their Graves by your Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages;
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:001923_0067_0FBA2DA94BA819B0"/>
and not only ſo, but the very way of Religion is like a Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Bridge, you need ſtep adviſedly that you may keep upon it, or, if fall, you may recover with much trouble: there is a great cauſe you ſhould be wiſe, for Free grace will never teach ſin, nor folly; which that you may have help in, conſider what is ſaid from the above-ſaid Arguments, and weigh them well; and not only ſo, but ſtudy the Lives of all the Saints in Scripture, and do but ſee what trophees of their failings ſin hath hung up, and Satan: <hi>Davids</hi> ſins of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and Murther, <hi>Peters</hi> Denial of his Maſter, <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> Pride and Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in ſhewing his Treaſury, <hi>Jonahs</hi> Impatience and Folly, with the like: And ſee <hi>Pauls</hi> and <hi>Samuels</hi> Integrity, <hi>Phineas</hi> his Zeal, <hi>Nathaniels</hi> Truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> On the other hand, Oh walk in this Gallery among theſe Pictures; and for your ſecurity, reſt not without aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gods Love, which will make you wary; Who would endanger it; much leſs forfeit it; The empty Purſe fears not the Thief, but the full, looks to every Danger, every Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:001923_0068_0FBA2DAF6521FB40"/>
And really nothing is a greater ſafe-guard, than the freeneſs of this Love communicated to the Soul; ſtay you no where on this ſide of it, it will keep you ſteady in a trembling world. Thus may you walk, and from this bleſſed Principle, dear Child.</p>
            <p n="28">28. And that all this may be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, and is properly the life of Faith; remember, That the hardeſt thing in the world is, <hi>To believe in Jeſus Chriſt to theſe and all other good ends:</hi> Faith is a ſhort word and eaſily ſpoken; but Oh how hard is it in the Nature of it! when if ever the Lord works it in us, he finds nothing, not a ſpark of it, till he comes; nay he finds us oppoſite to the work of it; nay, he finds us unwilling to be made wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to cloſe with the offer of Chriſt, though made ſo freely; Hypocriſie and all evil hath its fountain here, we believe not: all the other graces ſink when this fails; all muſt have its cure: we bind the lame arm: we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint it, we warm it, and yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing helps, becauſe it is out of joynt. Oh we believe not! Anger rageth,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:001923_0069_0FBA2DB0D2FB5C18"/>
Luſt provokes, Covetouſneſs cozens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all is, <hi>We believe not:</hi> Nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach this, Art cannot compaſs it: to look near 1700 years back upon the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> (who was the Son of God) lived not forty years, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but three years and half, reproached home to his grave: and to believe in him for a Saviour: I ſay, this muſt be the work of another world, and the outſtretched Arm of God. See <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.18, 19, 20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To believe that another will pay all my debts, and become poor to make me rich, to die to make me live: Oh Miracle of Mercy!</p>
            <p>My Child, to believe things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, to hope things delayed, and to love God when he ſeems angry, are <hi>Luthers</hi> wonders, and mine, and thine. It is unbelief is that <hi>death in the pot,</hi> that lifts up ſenſe, that brings an ill report of God, that over haſtens our mercies, and ſets God a time for our deliverances. <hi>Faith is the gift of God,</hi> and the greateſt, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes difficulties, ſets Mercy to work againſt Juſtice, fetcheth the work done either by, without, or againſt Means,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:001923_0070_0FBA2DB26B5527A8"/>
throws Mountains into the Sea. A little little grain like Muſtard-ſeed will do wonders; enliven a dead heart, ſave even a damned ſoul; for ſuch we are: This will not be had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Word and Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. and the glory of it. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. for this, hear, beg, pray, weep, faſt, ſeek, labour, ſtrive, uſe violence, read, ask, wiſh, ſigh; and if you do believe, <hi>the Lord help your Unbelief,</hi> dear Child.</p>
            <p n="29">29. In the next, (which looks like the laſt) indeed, I muſt give you my thoughts about Death: which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly muſt be your portion (though Young) and I muſt tell you, it is a great word to ſay, <hi>I dare Die:</hi> many Books and Funeral Sermons you may read about it. I ſay, Life is ſweet, and Death ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible: many in ſeveral diſtempers may call for it, neither minding what it is, nor whether it leads: <hi>Job</hi> deſcribes it in his Agony: and Heathens could ſay, The firſt good was, <hi>not to be born,</hi> and the next, <hi>to die quickly: Paul</hi> (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove any) deſires it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ticles,</hi> and the laſt in the Bible are,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:001923_0071_0FBA2DB52753F670"/>
for the Lord Jeſus to <hi>come quickly:</hi> yea, to <hi>come to Judgment:</hi> as if it were the breathings of the Spirits of the Juſt in the laſt times: of which Spirit if you be, theſe will be your Reaſons, as theirs.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That you may ſee Him of whom you have heard ſo much, who hath done and ſuffered ſo much for you. Secondly, That you may have full draughts of what you now taſte only: Thirdly, That your Beloved may come to you, or you to Him: for whoſe ſake, and love, you may undergo here many frowns, brow-beatings, if not worſe: thus the abſent Spouſe waits for her Beloved. Fourthly, When the Sanctuary is troden upon, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 64.1. Fifthly, That the double Vail of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and Affliction may be taken off from you: Thus to wiſh for Death is to wiſh for Life.</p>
            <p>Theſe things I pray ſtudy: and to help you further, remember <hi>Balaam</hi> would fain die the Death of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, which you can never do, unleſs you live the Life of the Godly: to which I have written ſo much before: Only let me add, That you muſt live
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:001923_0072_0FBA2DB7AC68BE70"/>
in daily Expectation of this great Change; for though there be but one way into the World, there are many out. I know nothing to ſweeten it but the Death of Chriſt, who ſuckt out the poyſon of it, and ſaves to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt. <hi>Romans</hi> and Fools can die brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, write their own Elegies. I am ſure a well-led Life is the beſt Monument. If one at your door ſhould cry every Morning, <hi>You muſt Die,</hi> it would not reach far: but Chriſt died for you, My Child.</p>
            <p n="30">30. They ſay, and truly, <hi>Where Death leaves you, there Judgment finds you:</hi> Nothing flies ſo ſwiftly than as the Soul out of the body: and you know Eternity hangs upon a Moment: and ſuch is our Life: and eſpecially ſuch is the laſt groan and pang; and thither it leads. It is a vaſt Ocean, hath neither bound nor bottom: where you are to come before an Impartial Judge, with a naked and open breaſt: it is unavoidable, and the miſcarriage there intollerable. Many Books are written by many about theſe laſt things, and <hi>Apothegmes</hi> not a few:
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:001923_0073_0FBA2DBE1B1307C0"/>
the World and the Fleſh will not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for you: the former can lend you but a few Ceremonies and Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: the other dare go no further than the Judges door: but a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſprinkled by the Bood of Chriſt, will enter with boldneſs, and plead, and hear the voice of, <hi>Come ye bleſſed.</hi> Your wiſdom will be, to carry your Pardon in your boſome: there Wit, and Learning, Parts, and Wealth will get no hearing: there the Eloquent Orator is dumb: no Coin is currant, but the Blood of a loving Saviour; No man can appear there by any other Proxy: there Greatneſs muſt give way to Goodneſs; there Hypocriſie is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masked, Truth naked; there your fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Saints ſhall ſit Judges, though deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed amongſt men; there the Son of Man ſhall appear, becauſe deſpiſed as the Son of Man; there Preaching, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, Caſting out Devils will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, but a Name written in the Book of the Lamb. Oh that you would conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der betimes what a nothing a thouſand Years are to Eternity, yea, where you ſhall be an hundred Years hence: if the Grave make no diſtance betwixt

the Scepter and the Mattock; what will Eternity do when that ſhall make no difference? Wherefore I pray meaſure all your works by Eternity, eat, drink, ſleep, work by Eternity; the cry of a damned Soul is, I never minded Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: how many are every day carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faggots to burn them to Eternity?

            <p n="31">31. And becauſe I have brought you ſo far as the Great Day, give me leave to awaken you with the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Place, Heaven, and to let you know it in the particulars, which are the preſence of all good, and the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all evil; the former commends it ſelf unto you in theſe:</p>
            <p>Firſt, in the univerſality of it: whereas all things here below are but partial; ſo in the ſuitableneſs of it, they are there ſpiritual, and ſuitable to the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for their Continuance: the good things are not like Cherries

drawn by the lips, or Comforts taſted, and gone; but they ſtay and are good for ever.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Evil knows no Place, there Sin cannot dwell with that Holineſs, Sorrow cannot mingle it ſelf with that Joy: no more fading Riches, dying Friends, changing Honours, periſhing Beauty; no more aking heads, nor languiſhing diſeaſes; no more hearing the chain of the Priſoner, nor anger of the Oppreſſor; no cry of <hi>what do you lack?</hi> every Bottle is full, and every Bed eaſie, being of never-blaſting Roſes and Sweets: where every Room is paved with Love: where Wiſdom, Power, Mercy, and Grace have combined, to make all glorious and pleaſant. Then never be troubled about a dunghil-world: when the Apoſtle to the <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians,</hi> ſayes all in a few words, <hi>We ſhall be with the Lord for ever;</hi> and that includes all, anſwers all hard Queſtions, all hard Labours under the Sun. Remember the Swaggerer that met the poor Man ever mourning over his Sins, (quoth he) What, ſtill mourning? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But what if there be no Heaven? Ah Sir, quoth the other,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:001923_0076_0FBA2DC90BE1D6F0"/>
what if there be a Hell? The Doctrine of Hell was never enough Preach'd (ſome thinks) and there, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, is the preſence of all evil, and the abſence of all good; you may ſtudy it by the former, where the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented never die, and the Tormentor is never weary; where thought and fear, deſpair, puniſhment, extremity meet altogether in Eternity.

            <p>Coming from thence, at <hi>London</hi> God ſtruck me with the ſenſe of my ſinful eſtate, by a Sermon I heard under <hi>Pauls,</hi> which was about Forty Years ſince; which Text was, <hi>The burden of Dun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

where I was five or ſix Years, not without the Preſence of God in my Work; but many of my Acquaintance going for <hi>New-England,</hi> had engaged me to come to them when they ſent, which accordingly I did: And truly, my reaſon for my ſelf and others to go, was meerly not to offend Authority in that difference of Judgment; and had not the Book for Encouragement of Sports on the Sabbath come forth, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny had ſtaid.

coming hither, found the Nation em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broiled in thoſe Civil Diſcontents, Jars and Wars, and here was forced to ſtay, though I had nothing to ſupport me but the Parliaments Promiſes; And not being able in a ſhort time to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs my Errand, ſtudied with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant purpoſe of Returning, and went with the firſt to <hi>Ireland,</hi> moſt of your <hi>London,</hi> Godly Miniſters being engaged in Perſon, Purſe, and Preaching in this Trouble: I thought <hi>Ireland</hi> the cleareſt Work, and had the Pay of a Preacher then and after-ward, as I could get it.

or Cabal at any time, I hated it, and had no ſtowage for Counſel, thinking all Government ſhould lie open to all; nor had Penny from any General, but lived in debt, as now I am; nor had means for my Expences, what I had, others ſhared in.

            <p>But becauſe what is before written, may ſeem my white ſide only, I ſhall deal in all plainneſs with you, That though for Religion I am and have been really ſound and Orthodox to my beſt apprehenſion, according to the bleſſed Word of God, and the generality of the Proteſtant Confeſſions; yea, though I travelled through Proteſtant Churches for Order, to eſpy the beſt, &amp; have joyned with the Churches of Chriſt, and took in with that I call a <hi>Tender Presbytery,</hi> for ſuch was ours in <hi>New-England,</hi> and yet ſo, as I never Unchurcht any Pariſh where a godly Miniſter was, and godly People joyned together, though not all ſo; and do know God may have a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under all Forms, and would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw to the furtheſt Judges, rather than give offence to what I cannot cloſe with: yet ſo unworthy have my thoughts been of my ſelf to be a meet Preacher of the

Goſpel, that more than twice I had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it over, had not Friends prevailed; yea, my profeſſion of the Goſpel hath been with much folly, weakneſs, and vanity: I crave pardon of any that have taken offence, though in a Chriſtian way I have not had the reproofs of Three ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Preaching or Converſation. I am heartily ſorry I was Popular, and known better to others than my ſelf; It hath much lain to my heart above any thing almoſt, That I left that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple I was engaged to in <hi>New-England,</hi> it cuts deeply, I look upon it as a Root-evil: and though I was never Parſon nor Vicar, never took Eccleſiaſtical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, never Preached upon any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement for Money in my life, though not without offers, and great ones; yet I had a Flock, I ſay, I had a Flock, to whom I was Ordained, who were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of my Life and Labours; but I could never think my ſelf fit to be their Paſtor, ſo unaccompliſht for ſuch a work, for which, <hi>Who is ſufficient</hi> (cryes the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle?)

<pb n="83" facs="unknown:001923_0087_0FBA2DE3093FFB20"/>
ſtay. For Errors in Judgment I have pitied, never cloſed with any that I know; when I was a Tryer of others, I went to hear and gain Experience rather than to judge; When I was called about mending Laws, I rather was there to Pray, than mend Laws; When to judge in Wills, I only went ſometimes to learn, and help the Poor, than to judge: but in all theſe I confeſs I might well have been ſpared.</p>
            <p>Nor do I take pleaſure in remembring any my leaſt activity in State-matters, though this I can ſay, I no where mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed who Ruled fewer or more, ſo the good ends of Government be given out, in which Men may live in <hi>Godlineſs and Honeſty.</hi> I have often ſaid, That is a good Government, <hi>where Men may be as good as they can, not ſo bad as they would;</hi> where good Men and Things are upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt; and have thought if good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates cannot bring all to their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Diſſenters may have liberty, being kept out of Office, and want ſome other Publick Characters. That which a Friend of mine, and my ſelf writ by Letters about Magiſtrates, was very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and the Records of the Tower were
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:001923_0088_0FBA2DE964894D50"/>
only named, as giving way to all other Records, to cut off diſſentions, or marks of Tyranny, which no good Prince will exerciſe; I am ſorry if any offended, it was Zeal for Quietneſs. I honour Laws, and good Lawyers heartily, and know their uſe; only eaſe, expedition, and cheapneſs, what good Man doth not call for? Sedition is the heating Mens minds againſt the preſent Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in that I never was, yet ſorry, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ſhould have any hard thoughts of me, or know ſo inconſiderable a creature as my ſelf: I never could be fit for a Court, many ways not fit, and am therefore grieved, that I was either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, or content to live, where I could do ſo little good; for I would die without a ſecret in my boſome, unleſs Caſes of Conſcience in the way of Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, which are ſecret indeed; and for reading them to the World I had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a Portion, if it had been conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to me.</p>
            <p>Upon all this you may ask what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign I drove, being looked upon that way? Truly theſe three.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That Goodneſs that which is really ſo, and ſuch Religion, might be highly advanced.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="unknown:001923_0089_0FBA2DEA8AF121D8"/>Secondly, That good Learning might have all Countenance.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That there may not be a Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar in <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for all theſe I have projected or laboured, and I have no other. And theſe I pray his preſent Majeſty may look to, and that God would bleſs him every way.</p>
            <p>If in the proſecution of theſe I have uſed any of my wonted rudeneſs, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided zeal, I am heartily as ſorry. So begging pardon from God and Man, Conſtitution or Cuſtom, I conclude in theſe particulars, though the aim be good.</p>
            <p>I conclude the former thus; I think, That as bad men care not who rule, or what is uppermoſt, ſo they may have their Luſts; ſo good Men, if they may enjoy God and His Truth, with good Conſcience. For my whole courſe you know and feel where my wound hath been theſe Twenty Years, which hath occaſioned not only my Head and Heart breaking, but travelling from mine own Neſt into buſineſs.</p>

which I have, took no ſmall place in my trouble. You may know that I was not in the City when that Act was made, nor urged my Lord <hi>Grey</hi> to buy; nor ever adviſed the ſaid Lord (as I had time) but to good and juſt things and company, againſt that Spirit of <hi>Levelling</hi> then ſtirring: and do heartily wiſh, that taken offence might die; for it was not intended by me, who could and can be as well contented without Land, as with it; never being ambitious to be great or rich ſince I knew better things.</p>

And now I muſt return to your ſelf again, and to give you my thoughts about your own Condition, I do firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you to the Lord, and then to the care of a Faithful Friend, whom I ſhall name unto you, if a Friend may be found in this Juncture, that dare own your Name (though there be more of your Name) and if ſuch a Friend ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe it, that you ſerve in ſome Godly Family, to which you ſeem to incline, and muſt (it ſeems;) but truly if not a good Family, what will your Condition be? Dwell where God dwells, and be in ſuch Company, as you muſt be with

But if you would go home to <hi>New-England</hi> (which you have much reaſon to do) go with good Company, and truſt God there: The Church are a tender Company; a little will carry us through the World, yea very little: O Godlineſs with Content! Your Faithfulneſs to me and your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will find Acceptance in Heaven, I truſt. My dear Child, tell me, How couldſt thou be without Gods Rod? Remember he hath a Staff alſo. For your Mother (conſidering her Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per) I have and ſhall ſay more unto you. To his Grace, who is able to do above all we can ask or think, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you both.</p>
            <p>And if I go ſhortly where Time ſhall

be no more, where Cock nor Clock diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh Hours; ſink not, but lay thy head in his Boſome who can keep thee: for He ſits upon the Waves. Farewel.</p>
