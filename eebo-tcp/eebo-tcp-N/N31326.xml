            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>AS</hi> it is not the Deſign of the following Sheets to caſt the popular Odium on either of the Parties, but merely to expoſe the Attempt to obtain Redreſs in behalf of the Defendant, and in his Abſence, againſt a legal Determination of the Suit, by a Method entirely new, unconſtitutional and illegal; a particular Detail of the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on both Sides is carefully avoided.</p>
            <p>The ſtrange and unnatural Conſtruction which has been lately given to his Majeſty's Royal Order, with a View to countenance the Appeal ſought for in behalf of the Defendant, and the dangerous Tendency of ſuch a Conſtruction, are the Objects which the Editor has in View. This Conſtruction muſt indeed be alarming to every Britiſh Subject; who, among the many invaluable Privileges, by which he is diſtinguiſhed from the Subjects of other Princes, will naturally eſteem a Trial by his Peers as one of the greateſt — In ſhort it is a Conſtruction which ſubverts the antient and fundamental Law of the Land, renders all Property in the Colonies precarious and of little Value, and the Method of obtaining Juſtice extremely dilatory, and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively ruinous to the Litigants.</p>
            <p>But to ſhew the pernicious Conſequences of this Conſtruction, Arguments need not here be urged — His Honour the Chief Juſtice has, in the legal Diſcharge of his important Truſt, aſſigned ſuch Reaſons, as muſt be ſufficient to expoſe the falſe and pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Doctrine, <hi>that the Crown by its Inſtruction deſigned to change the Laws of the Land, or to execute Juſtice by other Means than are known in the Mother Country.</hi>

               <hi>Thomas Forſey, againſt Waddel Cunningham.</hi> Report of an Action of Aſſault, Battery and Wounding, tried in the Supreme Court of New-York, October <hi>1764.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THIS Suit was brought for a violent Aſſault, Battery, and Wounding, committed by the Defendant on the Plaintiff, on the 28th Day of July 1763. The Chief Juſtice, on a Petition and Affidavit of the Violence of the Battery, gave his Order for holding the Defendant to Bail, in £.5000.</p>
            <p>Upon the Return of the Writ in October Term 1763, the Plaintiff declared, in the uſual Form; and after an Imparlance to January Term following, the Defendant pleaded the general Iſſue, Not Guilty.</p>
            <p>In April Term 1764, the Defendant moved the Court for a ſtruck Jury, which Motion was granted, and a Jury was accordingly ſtruck during the Term.</p>
            <p>In October Term following, the Cauſe came on regularly, to be tried by the Jury that had been ſtruck at the Defendant's Requeſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:041438_0006_101A88C7C6D680E8"/>The Trial laſted near twelve Hours, in the Courſe of which, the Proof of the Battery was ſo full and clear, that the Defendant relied only on ſome Evidence in Mitigation of Damages, in the Production of which, the fulleſt and faireſt Scope was given to him.</p>
            <p>There were three Gentlemen, of Council for the Plaintiff, and four for the Defendant; the Witneſſes on both Sides were very fully and circumſtantially examined, and the Evid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nce as fully and circumſtantially ſummed up by the Council, for both Parties: The Jury went from the Bar late in the Evening, and returned to it the next Morning with their privy Verdict; by which they found the Defendant Guilty of the Treſpaſs, Aſſault, Battery and Wounding charged in the Plaintiff's Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and aſſeſſed the Plaintiff's Damages, at one thouſand five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds, and his Coſts at ſix Pence.</p>
            <p>On Saturday, the laſt Day of the Term, the Defendant's Council moved the Court, to ſet aſide the Verdict, for the Largeneſs of the Damages; but the Court conceiving that the Damages were not exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, rejected the Motion, and ordered Judgment to be entered for the Plaintiff. The Defendant being abſent beyond Sea, Robert R. Waddel who acts for him under a Letter of Attorney, then came up to the Bench; and preſented to the Judges, a Petition to admit an Entry of an Appeal to the Governor and Council, and a Bond with Security, as grounded upon the Inſtruction. The Court ſuffered no Entry to be made, and returned the Papers; declaring no ſuch Appeal would lie, and that the Inſtruction was not deſigned to favour any other, than a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval by Writ of Error—The Inſtruction is in theſe Words.</p>

after, another Inſtrument, under the ſame Seal, was ſerved on the Chief Juſtice, in the Words following,</p>
            <q>
               <hi>GEORGE the Third,</hi> by the Grace of GOD, of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> France and Ireland, King, Defender of the Faith, &amp;c, To our Chief Juſtice and other the Judges of our Supreme Court of Judicature, for our Province of <hi>New-York,</hi> in <hi>North-America,</hi> and to all other the Officers of our ſame Court, whom it ſhall or may concern, <hi>GREETING</hi>: WHEREAS by our Writ to you, and every of you directed, we lately commanded you, that all further Proceedings ſhould be ſtay'd on the Verdict, obtained againſt <hi>Waddel Cunningham,</hi> at the Suit of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Forſey,</hi> on a certain Plea of Treſpaſs and Aſſault, tried by the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of our Sovereign LORD, the now King, at our laſt Supreme Court, holden for our Province aforeſaid, until the Merits and Matter thereof ſhould be heard before our Governor and Council of our ſaid Province, for the Time being, (agreeable to our Royal Inſtructions, in the ſaid Writ mentioned) on the Appeal of the ſaid <hi>Waddel Cunningham;</hi> in Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence whereof, and for the fully enabling our ſaid Governor and Council, to determine the Matter of the ſaid Verdict; We further command and ſtrictly enjoin you, and every of you, that laying aſide all other Matters and Things whatſoever, you cauſe all and every the Proceedings againſt the ſaid <hi>Waddel Cunningham,</hi> whether by Bill, Plaint, or otherwiſe, whereon the ſaid Verdict was obtained, to be brought before our ſaid Governor and Council, at <hi>Fort-George,</hi> in our City of <hi>New-York,</hi> and Province aforeſaid, at the Return of the ſaid Writ, being the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Day of this Inſtant <hi>November,</hi> as you will anſwer the Neglect at your Peril; and that you have then there this Writ, returnable on the ſame Day, and at the ſame Place. <hi>WITNESS</hi> the Honourable <hi>CADWAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LADER COLDEN</hi> Eſquire, our Lieutenant Governor, and Commander in Chief of our Province of <hi>New-York</hi> aforeſaid, the ſecond Day of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> in the Year of our Lord, one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſixty four, and in the fifth Year of our Reign.</q>
            <p>The Chief Juſtice, on the Day mentioned for their Return, delivered the two Inſtruments to the Lieutenant Governor and Council, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned his Reaſons for not returning them in Form, and requeſted Time
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:041438_0010_101A88D06ADAB018"/>
to reduce thoſe Reaſons to writing, which he afterwards delivered in, to the Governor and Council.</p>
            <p>But that they may have their proper Weight, it ſeems expedient to prefix to them the Oath which the Judges take at the Time of their Appointment, which is in theſe Words.</p>

                              <head>REASONS offered by <hi>Daniel Horſmanden,</hi> 
                                 <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Chief Juſtice of the Province of <hi>New-York,</hi> to his Honour the Lieutenant Governor and the Honourable His Majeſty's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil for the ſaid Province, againſt returning an Inſtrument under Seal, whereby all Proceedings on the Verdict lately obtained by the ſaid <hi>Thomas Forſey,</hi> againſt the ſaid <hi>Waddel Cunningham</hi> in the Supreme Court, are commanded to be ſtayed, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inſtrument under Seal, whereby the Juſtices of the ſaid Supreme Court are commanded to cauſe the Proceedings where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſaid Verdict was founded, to be bro't before tne Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Governor and the Council.</head>
                              <p>I beg Leave to perfix a State of the Proceedings between the Parties, not only, the more clearly to avail myſelf of thoſe Reaſons, but alſo, in Compliance with my Oath of Office, by which I am bound to certify the King's Majeſty, of the Proceedings, on which thoſe Inſtruments (which I conſider as Letters in Delay of Juſtice) are ſaid to be grounded.</p>
                              <p>On Wedneſday laſt, I brought into this Court thoſe Letters, and as both the Prohibition, and Command, appeared to me unwarrantable, I thought it my Duty to obey neither, but to lay the Inſtruments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, and to aſſign my Reaſons, for the Part I acted, on this new, and extraordinary Occaſion. —The Liberty you gave me to reduce the Subſtance of what I then offered to Writing, as it affords me an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, to expreſs myſelf with greater Perſpicuity, is an Indulgence, for which I return your Honour and the Council my hearty Thanks.</p>
                              <p>The Suit which occaſioned thoſe Letters to the Judges (for they are directed to us all) was an Action of Treſpaſs brought in the Supreme Court; in which the Plantiff Forſey declared for an Aſſault, Battery, and wounding, to his Damage £.5000; upon which the Cauſe was at iſſue on the Plea of not Guilty; and the Jurors in the laſt Term of October, found for the Plantiff, and aſſeſſed his Damages at £. 1500.</p>
                              <p>The Pannel conſiſted of a ſpecial Jury of Freeholders, at the Defendant's Requeſt —No Challenges were made to either of them— The Trial took up twelve Hours — No Evidence that was offered, by either Party was refuſed to be admitted by the Court — All the Judges were upon the Bench —The Plantiff had three, and the Defendant four Gentlemen attending as their Council —The Proofs were largely
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:041438_0013_101A88D915D18E58"/>
ſummed up on both Sides; and the Bar, and Country, muſt unanimouſly declare, that the Trial was regular, and ſolemn; and conducted with the utmoſt Fairneſs and Deliberation.</p>
                              <p>On the 27ſt of the Month, tho' the laſt Day of the Term, on which no ſpecial Motions are made, the Council for the Defendant were indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with a Motion for a new Trial. But no Reaſon being aſſigned, but a Complaint that the Damages were exceſſive (which did not appear to the Court to be well founded) and the Treſpaſs being very atrocious, and the Proofs clear, the Court over-ruled the Motion.</p>
                              <p>It affords ſtrong Ground of Preſumption that the Proceſs and Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are regular, ſince no Writ of Error has been yet offered to us — The Verdict of the Jury muſt therefore be the ſole Cauſe of Complaint; and Relief againſt that, is now expected from your Honours.</p>
                              <p>This ſeems to be founded upon an erroneous Interpretation of the thirty ſecond Inſtruction, given by his Majeſty to the Governor of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince: A Conſtruction which I could not countenance, by an Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Letters ſent to me; for the following Reaſons,</p>
                              <p n="1">I. Becauſe it ſuppoſes the Royal Order to aim at altering the antient and wholeſome Laws of the Land.</p>
                              <p>By the common Law of England the Trial of Facts is entruſted to the Jury; and the Power to declare the Law upon them, is committed to the King's Judges—Theſe are diſtinct Provinces; and the Limits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them guarded by invariable Uſage and the moſt inconteſtible Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities—The Errors of the Judges may be corrected by ſuperior Judicatories; as for Inſtance, thoſe of the King's Bench in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer Chamber, and by the Houſe of Peers—But in all thoſe Removes, the Verdict of the Jurors ſuffers no Re-examination, but is final and deciſive:—This is the Law at Home.</p>
                              <p>The Supreme Court here proceeds in the Main, according to the Practice of the Courts at Weſtminſter; and the Common Law of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, with the Statutes affirming, or altering it, before a Legiſlature was eſtabliſhed here, and thoſe paſſed ſince ſuch Eſtabliſhment, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly extended to us, with our legiſlative Acts (which are not to be repugnant to the Laws of England) conſtitute the Laws of this Colony: And tho' there are many Inſtances of Judgments, reverſed and affirmed,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:041438_0014_101A88DBB063E0E0"/>
in a Courſe of Error, before the Governor and Council, I do affirm, with the higheſt Confidence, that not one Verdict was ever re-examined by any ſuperior Judicatory in the Province.</p>
                              <p>An Attempt then to re-examine the Verdict of a Jury, is repugnant to the Laws, both of England and this Colony — This is well known to the Crown;—and to ſuppoſe that his Majeſty deſigned to change the Law, and that too in one of its moſt important Articles, is certainly abſurd, and being dangerous both to the Prerogatives of the Crown and the Liberty and Safety of the Subject; it is in my humble Opinion highly criminal to aſſert, that the King's Order has any ſuch Aim. Nor,</p>
                              <p n="2">II. Is there any Shadow of Reaſon, from the Words of the Inſtruction, to countenance ſuch a bold Interpretation.</p>
                              <p>'Tis true, the Governor is to permit and allow Appeals from the Courts of common Law; and who can deny, but that in Common Speech, the bringing of a Writ of Error, as it carries the Cauſe from a lower to a ſuperior Tribunal, is an Appeal?—And ſurely that muſt be the beſt Explication, which ſatisfies the Term, without altering the Law; eſpecially if we conſider that the Royal Inſtructions, given before the Year 1753, adopted that very Term, as applicable to Caſes of Error, the Words of the former Inſtructions running thus: You are
<q>to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Appeals, in Caſe of Errors, from any of the Courts of Common Law</q>
and that ſuch is the meaning of the Appeals mentioned in the preſent Inſtruction as it is underſtood by his Majeſty in Council, will appear from the caſe of <hi>Gordon</hi> —and <hi>Lowther,</hi> 2d Lord <hi>Raymond</hi> 1447. Add to this that the preſent Inſtruction, does itſelf refute the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation upon which this Meaſure is founded; for you'll be pleaſed to obſerve,
<q>
                                    <p n="1">1ſt. That the Truth is, that all the Appeals we have had (I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept none) have been in Error, and proſecuted by Writs of Error, and it being his Majeſty's Pleaſure that the Governor upon Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals ſhall
<q>iſſue a Writ in the Manner which has been uſually accuſtomed.</q>
No other Appeal, than by ſuch Writ, is directed.</p>
                                    <p n="2">2dly. The Judges of the Supreme Court, though Members of the Council, are forbid to Vote on the Deciſion above:
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:041438_0015_101A88DE4449AFD0"/>
for which I can aſſign no other Reaſon, than becauſe they are ſuppoſed to have prejudiced the Cauſe, eſpecially as Leave is nevertheleſs given them, to render the Reaſons of their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the Judges do in <hi>England,</hi> upon Error brought before the Peers. And as they are only Judges of the Law and not Triers of the Facts; theſe Clauſes evidently imply, that the Appeal given, is only in Error, and not upon the Verdict of the Jury.</p>
                                 </q>
                              </p>
                              <p>Beſides this, numberleſs Objections againſt a contrary Conſtruction may be drawn <hi>ab Inconvenienti,</hi>—Permit me to mention a few;</p>
                              <p n="1">I. Who is ignorant that in the Courts of Common Law, the Evidence of the Witneſſes to the Jury, is all <hi>viva voce?</hi>— It reſults therefore, that they can tranſmit nothing but a Tranſcript of the Record, which contains no Part of the Proofs—The Court above, remains then uninformed of the Facts upon which The Verdict was given, and cannot adjudge upon them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Re-examination of the Witneſſes, againſt that Attempt ſeveral Objections inſtantly occur.—I will hint at but two;
<q>
                                    <p n="1">1ſt. The Cauſe muſt be made <hi>Res integra:</hi> For the Want of written Memorials of the firſt Evidence, renders it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to confine the Proofs above, to what they were in the firſt Production to the Jury. — And ſo the Trouble and Charge of the Trial to the Parties, Court and Country, were all to no Purpoſe,—And,</p>
                                    <p n="2">2dly. It tends to open a Flood-Gate to Perjury:—For both Parties being now appriſed of the Proofs which were ſecret 'till the firſt Trial, every Effort will be made to blacken the Character of the moſt material Witneſſes, and to ſupply all former Deficiencies.</p>
                                    <p>And from theſe Sources ſuch Streams will flow, as would extort the Groans of all, who delight in the due Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Juſtice.</p>
                                 </q>
                              </p>
                              <p n="2">IIdly. The Appeal contended for, impeaches the Wiſdom of our Law in that diſtinguiſhing Article of Trials by Jury; ſince all Verdicts in Cauſes above the Value of £. 300 Sterling would be worſe than in Vain.</p>
                              <p n="3">
                                 <pb n="12" facs="unknown:041438_0016_101A88E30A5ED4B8"/>IIIdly. It will encourage a Spirit of Litigiouſneſs; and introduce Idleneſs, to the Ruin of many Families, and the great Impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of the Country.</p>
                              <p n="4">IVthly. The Expence attending ſuch Appeals will be intolerable— As the Proofs before the Governor and Council muſt neceſſarily be reduced to Writing, to Form what <hi>Civilians</hi> call the <hi>Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tella,</hi> for the next Remove of the Cauſe to his Majeſty in privy Council; It will follow, that according to their Uſage, there muſt alſo be Interrogatories, croſs Interrogatories, Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and croſs Examinations, and the Production of Exhibits— And he that is acquainted with the Proceſs of the civil Law Courts, will readily agree, that the Evidence introduced on a common Law Trial, of Twelve or Twenty-four Hours, eſpecially, when Titles to real Eſtates are in Queſtion, and Deeds offered, will, if reduced to Writing, ſwell the <hi>Apoſtels,</hi> to a Size ſo enormous, that the Trouble and Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>

                                 </gap>, will often ſurpaſs the Value of the Thing in demand. And it may be of Uſe to obſerve here, (as a farther Proof, that it was not the Object of the Inſtruction, to allow Appeals upon the whole Merits;) that you have not Officers to tranſact the Buſineſs, that would thereby be introduced; the Court of the Governor and Council, having neither a Regiſter, nor Examiner, to this Day, appointed by the Crown.</p>
                              <p n="5">V. It would be impoſſible for thoſe Courts of Appeal to diſcharge the Duty to which they would in ſuch Caſe be obliged. — The Governor and Council muſt ſit <hi>de Die in Diem</hi> all the Year round, for the Buſineſs of their Colony — And how then can his Majeſty in privy Council, beſides attending to the arduous Affairs of his Kingdoms, examine all the tedious Complaints brought up from all the Provinces for his Royal Deciſion?</p>
                              <p n="6">VI. To what an amazing Inſecurity and Danger muſt the Subject according to this Project, be reduced and expoſed?</p>
                              <q>Let me ſpecify a few Inſtances;</q>
                              <p n="1">1ſt. As the Expence, ſo the Delays, will be infinite—How great then the Encouragement for Contention? What wrongful Poſſeſſor and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched Tenant, will give up his unjuſt Defence? What Treſpaſſer will pay the Damages of an injured Plantiff, when as in this Caſe, the

Death of either Party is the perpetual Extinction, not only of the Suit depending, but the very Cauſe of Action? What Loſer will not appeal upon the bear Preſumption that the firſt Witneſſes againſt him may be dead, or abſent, on the new Trial?</p>

                              <p>Theſe are ſome of the Reaſons which induce me to be of Opinion, that the King's Inſtructions do not countenance the Exerciſe of any Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Authority to reverſe the Verdict of a Jury: — And as they give me the fulleſt Satisfaction,—I ſhall forbear aſſigning any other, tho' there are many — The firſt is ſufficient for us, who ſit as Judges — The Law warrants no ſuch Letters, as thoſe which the Defendant ſued out, and delivered to me — We have taken the Oath, preſcribed by the Statute of the 18 of Ed. 3. and have ſworn

                     <p>Upon which, it being obſerved by the Court, that the ſaid Oath was very extenſive and ſolemn, the ſaid Juſtice ſaid <hi>it is ſo,</hi> and that leſt thro' Surpriſe or Forgetfulneſs he might deviate from it, he found it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary frequently to read it, eſpecially before the holding the Supreme Court, and on the Circuits; and obſerved, that as his Oath of Office, as well as his Commiſſion, reſpected only the common Law and its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and could not admit him, by any poſſible Conſtruction, to decide or determine by any other Law; and as the common Law knew not of any ſuch Appeal from a Verdict to any other Court than that wherein it was taken, he held himſelf obliged by his Oath, to refuſe any Entry of the Appeal from the Verdict as offered, and that if he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed that Appeal, he ſhould have acted not only without Authority, but contrary to his Oath; for theſe Reaſons, he could not allow the Appeal as offered, and which he hoped would appear to be a full An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this Queſtion; adding therewith, if he had ſat in a Court of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty, or any Court from whence Appeals are allowed to a ſuperior Juriſdiction, he ſhould doubtleſs upon Motion, have allowed them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law and Practice of ſuch Courts.</p>

                     <p>However, if the Court inſiſted upon his giving an Opinion on the Legality of that Writ, he was ready to give it: To which the Court agreed, that the Reaſon offered was ſufficient, why any Opinion at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent on that Writ, ſhould not be deſired.</p>

                  <div type="document">
                     <p>Mr. Juſtice <hi>Livingſton</hi> then delivered his Reaſons in Writing, which were ordered to be entered, and are as follow:</p>
                     <q rend="inline normQuotes">
                        <p>BEING deſired by your Honours, to give you the Reaſons of my Conduct, in refuſing to return two Inſtruments under Seal, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the Chief Juſtice, and the other Judges of the Supreme Court;
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:041438_0026_101A88FCD3B0EC90"/>
by one of which, all Proceedings on a Verdict obtained by <hi>Thomas Forſey,</hi> againſt <hi>Waddel Cunningham,</hi> are commanded to be ſtayed; and by the other, for the more fully enabling the Governor and Council to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the Matter of the ſaid Verdict; we are further commanded, as we will anſwer the ſame at our Peril, to Cauſe all the Proceedings againſt the ſaid <hi>Waddel Cunningham,</hi> to be brought before the Governor and Council.</p>
                        <p>I beg Leave to obſerve, that my Conduct might eaſily be juſtified, by ſhewing that I had no Notice of thoſe Letters, till the Chief Juſtice had refuſed to return them, after which no legal Return could be made, for a Writ muſt ever be returned by thoſe to whom it is directed. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I believe your Honours, in the Requeſt you made us, did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſo much to call upon us for a Juſtification of our Conduct, as to receive the Opinion of the Judges in an Affair of the greateſt Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and to be informed whether in our Explanation of the Inſtruction on which thoſe Inſtruments ſeem to be founded, we agree with the Chief Juſtice; I ſhall with the greateſt Willingneſs endeavour to anſwer your Expectations.—Had the Chief Juſtice in the leaſt doubted in what Manner he ought to have acted on the Receipt of theſe Inſtruments, he would have waited till the Return of the other Judges out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try permitted a Conſultation; but he thought, and it is by what I can learn the Opinion of every one of us, that the Caſe admitted no Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.</p>
                        <p>For it is evident, that the Courſe of the Law, by which the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives of the Crown, and the Rights of the Subject, are defined and ſecured, muſt at all Times be free and uninterrupted; and this is ſo parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly provided for, that by the Oath we have taken, we are to deny no Man Right by the King's Letters, nor none other Man's, but to proceed notwithſtanding ſuch Letters. This was not intended however, to prevent the ſtaying of Execution after Judgment, by Writs of Error; for the Correction of Errors is not a Delay, but a Furtherance of Juſtice.</p>
                        <p>The firſt Inſtrument appears to me, a very great Abuſe of the King's Name and Authority. It commands us in Terms very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpectful, and not ſuch as are uſual in Writs directed to us, wholly to forbear Proceeding or taking any further Step againſt the ſaid <hi>Waddel Cunningham,</hi> on the Verdict obtained againſt him. The Illegality of which will appear from theſe three Obſervations.</p>

It commands us not to do that, which the Law, our Duty, and common Juſtice to the Parties, oblige us to do; for had a Writ of Error been brought, we ſhould have ſtill been obliged to proceed to Judgment, and the ſigning of the Roll: And tho' it is allowable to bring Writs of Error before Judgment, this being the common Practice to prevent Execution, yet the Writ has no Effect till after Judgment; before that, the Party having received no Injury.</p>

Previous to which, I ſhall make a few Obſervations on the Inſtruction on which it is founded.</p>
                        <p>The Intention of this Inſtruction appears to me no more than a Direction to your Honours, when you ſhould ſuffer a Writ of Error to be brought, and when you are to diſmiſs the Cauſe. I have frequently read this Inſtruction on this Occaſion, and it amazes me to find that any
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:041438_0028_101A890301FBBC78"/>
Perſon ſhould think it liable to a different Explanation. What gives Riſe to the Conſtruction on which theſe Inſtruments are founded, is the frequent Uſe of the Word <hi>Appeal</hi>; but how ſlender a Foundation this is, muſt appear from the Inſtructions before the Year 1753, quoted by his Honour the Chief Juſtice, which direct that you ſhall allow Appeals in Caſes of Error from the Courts of Law; where the Word <hi>Appeal</hi> means nothing elſe but Writs of Error; and accordingly on all ſuch Appeals, Writs of Error have been brought. — After this comes the Inſtruction in Queſtion, and ſays, you ſhall allow Appeals from the Courts of common Law, only in ſome certain Caſes, <hi>to wit,</hi> When the Value of the Thing appealed for exceeds the Sum of <hi>Three Hundred Pounds Sterling.</hi> What can this mean, but ſuch an Appeal as was meant by the former Inſtruction? and in this Senſe it ſeems to have been underſtood by your Honours; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe you would not have ſuffered it to be made a Queſtion, whether you ought to take Cognizance of a Cauſe brought before you by Writ of Error, when the only Objection was, that the Thing appealed for, did not amount to <hi>Three Hundred Pounds Sterling</hi>: An Inſtance of this Kind I was Witneſs to laſt <hi>Wedneſday</hi>; for if the Inſtruction muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to relate to Appeals in the civil Law Form, Writs of Error would have ſtood upon the ſame Footing they did before this Inſtruction was given. In this Explanation and Acceptation of the Word, your Honours are juſtified by the Uſe of it in common Parlance, and tho' this be not frequent among Lawyers, yet it is ſome times ſo uſed. Dr. <hi>Cowel</hi> in his <hi>Interpretor,</hi> on the Word <hi>Appeal,</hi> ſays it is uſed in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, as in the civil Law, to ſignify the Removal of a Cauſe from an Inferior Judge to a Superior; and his Honour the Chief Juſtice has ſhewn you that it was ſo underſtood by the King in Council. — The Truth is, both in the civil and in the common Law, the Word is uſed in theſe two Senſes, to ſignify an Accuſation, and an Appeal from a Judgment, but as in the common Law, (which is more particular in it's Diſtinctions than any other) there are four Methods of Appeal from a Judgment, <hi>to wit,</hi> By Writ of Error, Writ of falſe Judgment, Writ of Attaint, and <hi>Audita querela,</hi> and as theſe have but little Similiarity with each other, ſo that the Law which regards the one, rarely affects the other, Lawyers have ſeldom Occaſion to uſe the Word, which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Genus, but ſpeak generally of one or other of the Species; and the Word <hi>Appeal</hi> is appropriated to ſignify a particular Accuſation. But as it is very probable that this Inſtruction was not drawn by a Lawyer, and we know it was given for the Direction Gentlemen not much
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:041438_0029_101A8904EC8337C8"/>
verſed in Law Terms; it is very probable that it is here uſed, in the common Acceptation of the Word, to ſignify any Removal of a Cauſe, from one Court to another; and this with more Propriety, as it may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to include two of the Species above mentioned, a Writ of Error, and a Writ of falſe Judgment; the latter of which is a Remedy againſt an erroneous Judgment, in a Court not of Record.</p>
                        <p>This being the plain Meaning, and certainly the moſt legal Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of this Inſtruction, a Writ of Error ſhould have been ſent, and then your Honours would have had the Record before you: By the Inſtruction you are to ſend the uſual Writ, and we as Judges dare not obey any other than ſuch as are warranted by Law. All Others we muſt look upon as Letters contrived to delay or obſtruct the Courſe of Juſtice.</p>
                        <p>But it may be aſked, what Remedy ſhall the Party have, who is aggrieved by an unjuſt Verdict, or an Error in Fact.—To which the Anſwer is, he may have a Writ of Error, to try the Fact in the ſame Court; or he may have his Writ of Attaint, or according to the uſual Practice, move the Court for a new Trial; or he may have his <hi>Audita querela</hi>: All which are competent Remedies according to the Nature of the Caſe, without carrying the Matter before another Judicatory: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, the Judges are not concerned in any Errors in Fact, but ſuch as may be made Part of the Record by a Bill of Exceptions, if the Party pleaſes, and conſequently they ſtill remain indifferent, and therefore an Appeal from their Judgment is unneceſſary.</p>
                        <p>But what makes it evident, that the King did not intend by the above Inſtruction to alter the Law, and the Methods of Proceeding in the Supreme Court is this, The Inſtruction is not directed to the Judges of that Court, and therefore was not intended to regulate their Conduct: They muſt ſtill determine and act according to Law, and nothing can be more abſurd than to ſuppoſe, that they muſt have Recourſe to a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor's Inſtructions, to ſpell out their Duty from ſuch Scraps of them as he ſhall think proper to communicate. Further, it is evident, that Writs of Error were only meant by this Inſtruction.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p n="1">I. Becauſe it directs the Governor to iſſue a Writ in the Manner which has been uſually accuſtomed, and this is the uſual Writ, and no other has been uſed.</p>

This will bring up all that the Juſtices of the Supreme Court can ſend, and therefore any other Writ muſt be uſeleſs. Nothing elſe is in our Power at preſent, but the Record, and <hi>that</hi> we are ready to ſend as ſoon as it is properly demanded. In civil Law Courts, the Evidence is reduced to Writing, and therefore, upon an Appeal, may be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. But ſend to us as many Letters as you pleaſe, and let them contain Terms ſtill more menacing than thoſe ſent us upon this Occaſion, if the Law did not fully juſtify us in our Refuſal to return them, our Excuſe would be <hi>Nil dat, quod non habet.</hi> The Evidence went to the Jury, moſt of it was delivered <hi>viva voce,</hi> and it is impoſſible for us to retain it in our Memories: Should we make Records of all that was ſaid by each Witneſs, in every Trial, the Labour would be endleſs, and the whole Year would not ſuffice for the Trial of the Cauſes which yearly ariſe, tho' the Court ſhould ſit every Day, and the Country be obliged to a perpetual Attendance.</p>
                     <q rend="inline normQuotes">
                        <p>But as the Chief Juſtice has ſufficiently ſhewn the Inconveniencies which muſt attend this new Practice; I ſhall not enlarge on them, tho' many others might be mentioned that would reſult from altering the Law, in ſo eſſential a Point as Trials by Juries.</p>
                        <p>I have as much as poſſible in giving your Honours theſe Reaſons for my Conduct, avoided ſaying any Thing the Chief Juſtice has already obſerved; becauſe I would not treſpaſs on your Patience, by an unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Repetition. But he has been ſo copious, and has treated the Matter ſo well, that I have not been able to avoid ſliding into ſome of them.</p>
                        <p>Upon the Whole, it appears to me a very unſafe Interpretation of this Inſtruction, to ſay, that his Majeſty deſigned by it to eſtabliſh ſuch a Court, as has been altogether unknown to <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> ſince the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Revolution. That he intended (except in Cauſes thought too trifling to admit of an Appeal) to deprive his Subjects in this Colony of their indiſputable Right to Trials by Juries, one of the moſt antient Privileges of <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> confirmed to them by the great Charter, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to, and the grand <hi>Palladium</hi> of their Liberties.</p>
                        <p>Such a Suppoſition would be extremely injurious to his Majeſty, and the Memory of his Royal Grandfather, in whoſe Time this Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was firſt given, eſpecially as the Monarchs of the illuſtrious Houſe of Hanover, could never be juſtly charged with taking a ſingle Step towards infringing the Liberties of their People.</p>

                        <p>I Have received from Mr. <hi>Banyar,</hi> the Copy of the Minute of Council, made at the Council held at <hi>Fort-George,</hi> in the City of <hi>New York,</hi> on Wedneſday the 12th Inſtant; by which I am deſired to give my Reaſons, why the Appeal moved for in the Cauſe of <hi>Waddel Cunningham,</hi> againſt <hi>Thomas Forſey,</hi> in the Court below, was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; or whether according to the Laws and Conſtitution of <hi>England,</hi> an Appeal from the Verdict of the Jury, on the whole Merits of this Cauſe, could lie? In anſwer to the firſt Part, I have only to acquaint your Honour, and the Gentlemen of the Council, that I happened not to be in Court, the laſt Day of the Term, when the Appeal was moved for: As to the Second, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether according to the Laws and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of <hi>England,</hi> an Appeal from the Verdict of the Jury, on the whole Merits of this Cauſe, could lie?—In Anſwer to this Queſtion, I muſt declare to your Honour, and the Gentlemen of the Council, that
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:041438_0032_101A890D349618E0"/>
in all my reading, on the Laws and Conſtitution of <hi>England,</hi> I cannot recollect that I have ever met with any Thing in Favour of ſuch an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal. On the Contrary, the known Rule is, <hi>ad Quaeſtionem Juris reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent Judices, ad Quaeſtionem Facti reſpondent Juratores.</hi> The Book intitled <hi>The Law of Errors,</hi> P. 4, ſays, it is a known Rule in our Books,
<q>a Judgment being once given in <hi>Curia Domini Regis,</hi> ought not to be reverſed, nor avoided but by Error, or Attaint, for all Matters of Fact at common Law, are decided by a Jury of Twelve Men, againſt whom if they err in their Judgment, the Party grieved may bring Attaint.</q>
The Writ of Attaint lay originally at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, and is affirmed with ſome Alterations by the Statute of the 23d of HENRY the Eighth, C. the 3d; and in <hi>Wood</hi>'s Inſtitute of the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> P. 637, is thus deſcribed;
<q>A Writ of Attaint lies againſt a Jury, and is to examine whether a Jury of twelve Men gave a falſe Verdict, or contrary to Evidence, in a Court of Record upon Iſſue joined: That upon Conviction of the Jury, the Judgment following upon it may be reverſed.</q>
This appears to me to be the only Method formerly uſed to ſet aſide or avoid the Verdict of a Jury; but as <hi>Wood</hi> ſays, in the ſame Place, is now almoſt out of Uſe; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof, Motions are uſually made for new Trials when a Verdict is given contrary to Evidence; which ſeems to be the preſent Practice in the Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and is the Practice of the Supreme Court here: In removing a Cauſe from one Court to another for Matter of Error, the common Method I take to be by Writ of Error, tho' ſometimes by <hi>Certiorari,</hi> and the Proceedings on ſuch Writs, are in Relation to the Errors of the Judges, in Matters of Law; and are not to have Reſpect to the Verdict of the Jury, as appears to me from the Statute of the 27th of ELIZABETH, C. 8th, how erroneous Judgments in the King's Bench, upon certain perſonal Actions may be redreſſed; where Verdicts are expreſsly excepted· — I therefore give it as my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that according to the Laws and Conſtitution of <hi>England,</hi> the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal mentioned in the Queſtion could not lie.</p>

                  <p>HIS Honour the Lieutenant Governor required the Opinion of the Council on the following Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Whether by the 32d Inſtruction, the King has directed his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to permit and allow Appeals in all civil Cauſes, from the Courts

                  <p>His Honour the Lieutenant Governor declared his Diſſent from the ſaid Opinion, and ſignified he would give his Reaſons for ſuch his Diſſent to his Majeſty's Miniſters.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon a Motion was made, that the Reaſons offered by the Council in this Cauſe, on Wedneſday laſt, ſhould be entered, which were ordered to be entered accordingly, and are in the Words following:</p>

                              <p>HIS Majeſty's Council for the Province of <hi>New-York,</hi> as conſtituting with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor or Commander in Chief for the Time being, the Court eſtabliſhed by his Majeſty's royal Predeceſſors, and referred to in his preſent Majeſty's 32d Inſtruction; conceiving it to be a Queſtion of the utmoſt Importance, whether by Virtue of that, or any precedent royal Inſtruction, they are authorized in Conjunction with his Honour the Lieutenant Governor, to hold Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of this Cauſe, on an Appeal upon the Merits, from the Verdict of a Jury?</p>
                              <p>On this momentous Topic, the Lieutenant Governor, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, have taken the utmoſt Pains to form a Judgment, by which Juſtice may be diſtributed to the Subject, conſiſtent with the known and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Laws of the Land, and the true Senſe and Meaning of the royal Inſtructions.</p>
                              <p>In this Veiw, as it is a Caſe of the firſt Impreſſion, the Court unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly called upon the Judges of the Supreme Court, and ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the beſt Reputation in their Profeſſion, who have all concurred in Opinion, that we are not authorized either by Law or by any of the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:041438_0035_101A8915E9901B30"/>
royal Inſtructions, in ſeveral Inſtances ſo evidently grounded on the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> to hold juriſdiction of this Cauſe, as it is now brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us. The Court has beſides thoſe Aids, given every Advantage to a Point of ſo great Moment, which the moſt mature Conſideration could afford: And that it may appear upon what Reaſons his Majeſty's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil have the Unhappineſs to differ in Opinion from his Honour the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Governor, they beg Leave to conſider the Reaſons urged by him in Favour of the Appeal, as it is now brought before us; and to ſubjoin ſuch Anſwers to thoſe Reaſons, as it is conceived the Law will warrant.</p>
                              <p>His Majeſty's Council humbly hope, that they cannot better Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend themſelves to his royal Approbation, than by making the Law of the Land the Rule of their Conduct, in the Execution of every Part of the important Truſt committed to them; and flatter themſelves, that their Diſſention in Sentiment from his Honour, as it is founded on the cleareſt Law, will be a full Demonſtration of their Fidelity to the beſt of Princes.</p>
                              <p>In this material Diviſion in the Sentiments of this Court; his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Council are of Opinion, that his Honour's Reaſons will, if lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally incorporated into this their Anſwer, appear in a View, the moſt advantageous of which they are capable: And as we with the utmoſt Willingneſs ſubmit the Reaſons of our Judgment to the Conſideration of thoſe, who by Law are inveſted with a Power to correct our Errors, and controul our Determinations, we flatter ourſelves that his Honour would not decline the ſame Tribunal; and as we preſume the Law muſt at laſt determine upon this Difference, ſo alſo we conceive that ſuch Determination can beſt be made upon a fair State of the Contraſt.</p>
                              <p>In the Purſuit of this Method, his Honour's Reaſons will be reduced into as many different Paragraphs, as their Subject Matter naturally dictates; to each of which his Majeſty's Council will offer ſuch An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, as their Duty to their Prince, and the Laws of the Land clearly and undeniably ſuggeſt. The firſt Paragraph is as follows:</p>
                              <q>An Error I conceive runs thro' all the Arguments I have heard on this Subject, in not diſtinguiſhing between the Laws and the Execution of them: The executory judicial Powers are certainly in the Crown: The King is the Fountain of Juſtice: The Power of erecting Courts of Juſtice is conſequently in the Crown. The King may give them
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:041438_0036_101A891954C01688"/>
ſuch Modes of Proceeding, ſuch Extent of Authority and Juriſdiction, as he thinks moſt proper for obtaining Juſtice, in the Countries where ſuch Courts are erected, ſuited to the Circumſtance of the Country; and it may be done without the leaſt Alteration of the Law, by which ſuch Courts muſt Judge. This is evident in our Colonies; every Colony has different Courts and Modes of Proceeding from thoſe in other Colonies; and all of them different from the Courts in <hi>England</hi>; yet the ſame common Law has its full Force in all of them.</q>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>In Anſwer to this we obſerve:</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>That we think the Diſtinction which his Honour ſuppoſes between the Laws and the Execution of them, in the Senſe urged in his Rerſons, is groundleſs. For tho' we agree with him, that the Law muſt eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and unalterably be the ſame, unleſs changed by legiſlative Act, (which the Diſtinction taken by him neceſſarily ſuppoſes) and that judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Powers are in Suppoſition of Law in the Crown, that the King is the Fountain of Juſtice, and the Power of erecting Courts is in the Crown: Yet we beg Leave to deny his Inference, that the King may give them ſuch Modes of Proceeding, ſuch Extent of Authority and Juriſdiction as he thinks proper, as well as that ſuch Modes may be introduced as have hitherto been unknown, without the leaſt Alteration of the Law, by which ſuch Court muſt Judge.</p>
                              <p>For, 1ſt, we conceive that tho' the Crown has Authority to erect and conſtitute Courts,<note place="margin">

                                 </note> yet every Court muſt have ſuch a Juriſdiction, and muſt be ſo modelled in its eſſential Parts, as to have a known and common Law Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
                              <p n="2">2dly. Wherever ſuch new modelled Courts are eſſentially different from thoſe known in the Law, the Law muſt neceſſarily and of Courſe be altered; as the Maxim wiſely ſpeaks, <hi>Mutata Forma prope intere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitur Subſtantia rei</hi>; for Inſtance, were the Lieutenant Governor's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition juſt, that his Majeſty's 32d Inſtruction did intend that this Court as a Court of Appeals, ſhould have Cognizance of Matters of Fact, already ſettled and determined by a Jury, it would alter the Law in the grand and eſſential Point of Trials by Juries,<note place="margin">Law Er. <hi>4.</hi>—Cro.

                              <p n="3">3dly. Tho' different Methods of Proceeding in the different Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, are rather aſſumed by them than warranted by Law, and yet the principal Difference between them is perhaps in Matters of Form, (in which all the various Courts of Law in <hi>England</hi> do alſo differ); but the eſſential Parts of every common Law Court, <hi>to wit,</hi> a Jury to determine the Facts, and Judges to ſpeak the Law, are to be found, in all the Courts of Law of every Colony.</p>

                                 <p>His Honour in the next Paragraph obſerves, that <q>In all the Colonies Appeals to the King lie — this is eſſential to the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the Crown, without which the Dependence of the Colonies cannot be preſerved. The preſerving the Dependence of all the Dominions of the Crown, the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> evidently had in View, in the Act of the 6th of GEORGE the 1ſt. <hi>for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſecuring the Dependency of Ireland</hi>; but as this Matter is of great Importance, I ſhall conſider it more diſtinctly.</q>
                                 </p>
                              </q>
                              <p>His Majeſty's Council obſerve on this Paragraph, that the Word Appeal is uſed without ſettling its Definition: If by it is intended an Appeal upon Matters of Fact, they cannot help obſerving it is a <hi>Petitio Principii.</hi> That in all the Colonies an Appeal in the confined Senſe of the Word (and in the only proper Senſe in which it is known in the Law of <hi>England, to wit,</hi> from the Judgment of the Judges in Matters of Law, will lie to the King as preſent in Suppoſion of Law) in all his Courts, cannot be doubted. And in this Senſe an Appeal is clearly both eſſential to the Prerogative of the Crown, and abſolutely neceſſary for maintaining the Dependence of the Colonies, as the inferior upon <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> as the Superior Dominion; and theſe indeed are the only Reaſons why an Appeal in any Senſe of the Word will lie. For thus the greateſt Lawyers reaſon on the Subject.</p>
                              <p>As ſuch Dominions are not Parcel of, but Dominions dependent on <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> no remedial Writs between Subject and Subject will lie, from the ſuperior to the inferior Dominion; as they do from the Courts of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to any of the Counties of <hi>England,</hi> except Writs of Error. But if the Errors of Judges in the dependent Dominion might not be corrected by ſome Judicatory in the Kingdom on which it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, theſe Conſequences would follow, <hi>to wit.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="1">
                                 <pb n="34" facs="unknown:041438_0038_101A891D7AF69AC0"/>1ſt. That the Law appointed or permitted to ſuch inferior Dominion, might be inſenſibly changed within itſelf, without the Aſſent of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion ſuperior.</p>
                              <p n="2">2dly. That Judgments might be then given to the Diſadvantage or leſſening of the Superiority; which cannot be reaſonable: and to make the Superiority to be only of the King, but not of the Crown of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> as King <hi>James</hi> once would have it in a Caſe concerning <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Therefore it neceſſarily follows, that Writs of Error into all Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons belonging to <hi>Great Britain,</hi> upon the ultimate Judgments there given into the King's Courts of <hi>England,</hi> to reverſe or affirm Judgments, are neceſſary to ſupport a Dependence,<note place="margin">
                                    <hi>Vaughan's Repo.</hi> 401.402.</note> and are the only Writs that lie concerning Property between Subject and Subject.</p>
                              <p>But that Appeals upon Matters of Fact, are not neceſſary to ſupport the Dependence in Queſtion, is obvious at firſt View, for whether a Queſtion of Fact be determined between Subject and Subject, either in the Affirmative or Negative, cannot poſſibly affect ſuch Dependence.</p>
                              <p>As to the Statute for ſecuring the Dependence of <hi>Ireland,</hi> we cannot conceive how his Honour ſhould think of applying it to the preſent Caſe; for,</p>
                              <p n="1">1ſt. It contains not a ſingle Word in Relation to the Colonies, and therefore we cannot ſee the Propriety of the Aſſertion, that in the paſſing of that Act, the Parliament of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> had in View the preſerving the Dependence of <hi>all</hi> the Dominions of the Crown.</p>
                              <p n="2">2dly. That Act as far as it provides for ſecuring the Dependence of <hi>Ireland,</hi> directs nothing more than that the Houſe of Lords in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhall not have any Juriſdiction to judge, affirm or reverſe, any Judgment, Sentence, or Decree, made or given there, or in other Words, that they were not a Court of Appeals, either in Law or Equity. The Statute therefore cannot be underſtood to have intended a Change or Alteration in the Law, by giving the Subject in <hi>Ireland</hi> a Right of appealing from the Verdict of a Jury. In the next Paragraph his Honour obſerves, that,</p>
                              <p>
                                 <q>By the Word Appeal in Law is meant the removing the Cauſe from an inferior to a ſuperior Judicatory: By Writ of Error the Cauſe is
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:041438_0039_101A891F1D396E18"/>
not removed, but ſome diſputed Points in Law are determined, and which may have no Relation to the Merits of the Cauſe. — Appeals to the King in Perſon were by the common Law, both before and after the Conqueſt, and are confirmed by <hi>Magna Charta, nulli vendemus, nulli negabimus, nec deferemus Juſtitiam,</hi> relates eſpecially to Appeals, in which the King was Judge; for to ſell, deny, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay Juſtice, can have no reference to any Perſon, other than a Judge: The Complaint was, that large Sums of Money were demanded for Writs of Appeal, and at other Times they were denied or delayed. To remedy theſe Complaints, this Clauſe was made Part of the great Charter; thereby the Subject's Right to Appeals is confirmed, not taken away.</q>
                              </p>
                              <p>We agree with the Lieutenant Governor, that by an Appeal in Law, is meant the Removal of a Cauſe from an inferior to a ſuperior Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</p>
                              <p>But in Oppoſition to his Opinion, we beg Leave to ſhew in a few Words, that by Writ of Error the Cauſe and its Merits are removed, for the Record itſelf which contains the whole Pleadings between the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the Iſſue, the Verdict, and the Judgment is removed; and the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors eſſential in the Law in either Part of the Record are corrected, and the Judgment in the Whole is either reverſed or affirmed.—Thus then the Merits in Law ariſing from the Matters of Fact, contained in the Record, muſt neceſſarily receive their Determination in a Court of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors; nor can it juſtly be ſuppoſed, that conſtitutional Courts have been erected with Power to lay their Hands on the Proceedings in a Cauſe only to furniſh an Opportunity for handling ſome diſputed Points in Law, which have no Relation to the Merits of the Cauſe: Every Error therefore, which is corrigible by Law, muſt, in Suppoſition of Law, be eſſential to the Merits of the Cauſe; otherwiſe Writs of Error, inſtead of being conſtitutional Remedies, would neceſſarily and eſſentially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travene thoſe Words of the great Charter <hi>nulli negabimus, nulli differe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Juſtitiam vel Rectum.</hi> Thus then we conceive, that the Diſtinction ſet up by his Honour between Appeals and Writs of Error, is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; and that a Writ of Error is an Appeal upon the Merits in Law;<note place="margin">Salk. <hi>511.</hi> Comb. <hi>276.</hi>—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That this Chapter cannot concern the King's Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Adminiſtration of Juſtice on Appeals upon Matter of Fact, but the Adminiſtration of Juſtice by his known and ordinary Courts; in all which, the King, tho' not in Fact, yet in Suppoſition of Law is preſent, which is the Reaſon that the King himſelf, in the Words of the Charter, declares, he will not do what he intends his Court ſhall not;<note place="margin">2 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 46.</note>
                                 <q>And thus ſpeaks the great Oracle of the Law; no Man ſhall be condemned at the King's Suit, either before the King in his Bench, where the Pleas are <hi>Coram Rege,</hi> (and ſo are the Words, <hi>nec ſuper eum ibimus</hi> to be underſtood) nor before any other Commiſſioner or Judge whatſoever; and ſo are the Words, <hi>nec ſuper eum mittemus</hi> to be underſtood, but by the Judgment of his Peers, that is his Equals, and according to the Law of the Land;</q>
and from this Paraphraſe the Author ſays, the Senſe of the other Clauſe; <hi>we will deny, ſell, or refuſe Juſtice to no Man,</hi> is diſtinctly underſtood: And upon the ſame Clauſe he further obſerves thus;<note place="margin">

                                 <q>This is ſpoken in the Perſon of the King, who in Judgment of Law in all his Courts is preſent, and repeating theſe Words, <hi>Nulli vendemus,</hi> &amp;c.</q>

<q>The King's Bench, Chief Juſtices holding Pleas of the King, and ſoon after the Office of Chief Juſtice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to redreſs, and puniſh by Writ, the wrongful Judgments, Wrongs and Errors of other Juſtices, and to Cauſe to come before the King, the Parties and the Record, &amp;c. that is before the King, becauſe he always ſat in Perſon in his Bench; tho' the Judges rendered the Judgments:</q>

                              <p>But it may not be amiſs to take Notice here, of what the Lieutenant Governor ſays on the Subject of the Court of Huſtings, or the Mayor's Court of <hi>London.</hi>—
<q>In the Mayor and Sheriff's Court, commonly
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:041438_0044_101A892DC1640C70"/>
called the Huſtings, where all the Property of the Citizens is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, a Writ of Error does not lie, but an Appeal: In Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which, the King appoints Commiſſioners, who are <hi>to do full and ſpeedy Juſtice.</hi> They do not only reverſe, or affirm the Judgment of the Huſtings, but they give ſuch Judgment as the Huſtings ought to have given. The Juriſdiction of the Huſtings is by common Law; and Writs of Error do not lie in any Court whoſe Juriſdiction is by common Law, but an Appeal does.</q>
                              </p>
                              <p>Upon which we obſerve, that the Lieutenant Governor is again miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in ſuppoſing that an Appeal lies from the Huſtings to Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners in Matters of Fact, and that thoſe Commiſſioners do full and ſpeedy Juſtice upon the whole Merits, both in Fact and Law.

And in the ſame Chapter, the Author ſpeaks repeatedly of ſuing Writs of Error, and Commiſſions to remove the Judgments of the Mayor and Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> and of correcting the Errors of their Judgments. And from the ſeveral Forms of Writs and Commiſſions of Error to the Huſtings, contained in that Chapter, it appears clearly that they are eſſentially and ſubſtantially the ſame as Writs of Error in other Caſes, and to other Courts. And we ſuppoſe that the Lieutenant Governor's Miſtake on this Subject, proceeded from the Uſe of the Word Commiſſion, inſtead of Writ, tho' in Fact and Truth, every Writ of Error is more properly a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion than a Writ.<note place="margin">Law of Errors <hi>2</hi> and <hi>3.</hi>

This is ſtill evident in the Sheriff's Court, Coroner's Court, and in the Houſe of Peers: Appeals muſt extend to the whole Merits, where there was no Diſtinction between the Verdict of the Jury, and the Judgment of the Court, as it is evident by common Law there is not.</q>

Nor do we conceive, that the Inſtances adduced from this Sheriff's Court, Coroner's Court, and Houſe of Peers, are at all pertinent: In the two firſt, Facts are ſettled in the ſame Manner as they are in the Courts of <hi>Weſtminſter, to wit,</hi> by a Jury; and in the Houſe of Peers, nothing but Matters of Law, except where the Appeal is from the Equity Side of the Chancery, or Exchequer, in which the Proceedings by the Law of the Land are to be in the <hi>Pretorian</hi> Method, and the Evidence reduced to Writing, are ever determined there; it being below their Dignity to try Matters of Fact.<note place="margin">

The Reaſon given is, <hi>that tho' theſe Iſlands are Parcel of the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the Crown of England, they are not Parcel of the Realm of England.</hi> The like Obſervation is made with Reſpect to the <hi>Iſle of Man.</hi>

                              <p>Upon this Paragraph his Majeſty's Council Remark, that, they have already ſhewn, that Writs of Error were by the common Law; and as a further Proof, refer to the Regiſter of Writs, which was undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly compiled before the Conqueſt: This Book, by which moſt of the Writs ſtill in Uſe are framed, contains a great Variety of Writs of Error: The Power of trying Errors has not therefore been aſſumed, but belongs to the King's Courts, from Time Immemorial; nor can the Maxim <hi>boni Judicis eſt ampliare Juriſdictionem,</hi> mean any Thing more than that Judges are in the Diſtribution of Juſtice, to exerciſe every poſſible Power, which the Law will warrant. And as the Correction of Errors is by the common Law, it extends to all Times and to every common Law Court; the Diſtinction therefore, that Writs of Error do not lie in the Colonies, which is grounded on the other baſeleſs Diſtinction, that nothing but the antient common Law of <hi>England</hi> extends to the Colonies, muſt alſo appear to be without Foundation; and the ſuppoſed Neceſſity of an Act of Parliament, to give Writs of Error in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Caſes, which is in evident Alluſion to the 31ſt of El. Chap. I, whereby the Exchequer is authorized to hear and correct the Errors of
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:041438_0047_101A89360CAB06D8"/>
the King's Bench, is entirely groundleſs; for nothing is clearer than that before that Statute, Writs of Error did lie from the King's Bench, to the Houſe of Lords: The Statute therefore was not to give a Writ of Error where it did not lie before; but to carry a Caſe of Errors thro' the Exchequer to the Houſe of Lords, inſtead of removing it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to that auguſt and final Tribunal, as was the Practice by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law.</p>
                              <p>Nor does the Argument in Support of the Poſition, that Writs of Error did not lie at the common Law, receive any Weight from the Inſtance aſſigned, concerning Appeals from <hi>Jerſey</hi> and <hi>Guernſey</hi>; for my Lord <hi>Hale,</hi> from whoſe Hiſtory of the common Law, his Honour has probably collected this Inſtance, unfolds the Reaſons upon which an Appeal lies from theſe Iſlands, to the King in privy Council, which are theſe; thoſe Iſlands were Part of the Dutchy of <hi>Normandy</hi>; by the Laws of which Dutchy, an Appeal did lie to the Duke in his Council; and as after the Annexation of that Dutchy to the Crown, the Laws of <hi>Normandy</hi> continued unaltered, and the King of <hi>England,</hi> was Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> the Appeal muſt of Courſe be to him in Privy Council.</p>
                              <p>Beſides, this Inſtance does not ſhew that a Writ of Error, did not lie to thoſe Iſlands, but the Contrary is rather to be ſuppoſed; becauſe they had Trials by Juries, and therefore it is to be preſumed, that an Appeal from their Courts, lies in the ſame Caſes as in the Courts of <hi>England, to wit,</hi> on Errors in Law only; in ſhort, my Lord <hi>Hale,</hi> clearly intends to ſhew the Reaſon, why an Appeal lies from thoſe Iſlands to the King in Council, and not the Nature of that Appeal, which muſt be preſumed, if the ſame Word, in the ſame Author, is to be underſtood in the ſame Senſe, to mean in Caſe of Error only: Beſides, as a Proof of this Matter it is certain, that a Writ of Error did lie to the King's Courts at <hi>Calais,</hi> which was not Parcel of the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of <hi>England,</hi> but a diſtinct Dominion, dependent on the Crown of <hi>Great-Britain</hi>: Vin. Tit. Error, P. 484, No, 22, 4, Inſt. 282: As to the <hi>Iſle of Man,</hi> it was antiently an independent Kingdom, governed by its own Laws, which have never been changed to this Day; and in that Iſland, a Writ of Error is not known in their Law.</p>
                              <p>But as a Proof, that whatever the Laws of a dependent State may be, they are not to be changed by Authority of the Crown; it appears in
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:041438_0048_101A89387286A1A0"/>
the Books, that the Crown can only appoint Judges by Commiſſion, to redreſs Injuſtice and Wrong, according to the Law and Juſtice of the Iſle. 4. Inſt. 285.</p>

                                 </gap> Power of Appeal in Matters of Fact, from the higheſt to the loweſt: It is not therefore to be wondered at, that in thoſe Colonies, as well as in others, (in which we conceive the Law of <hi>England</hi> is not ſo well underſtood, nor has been ſo ſtrictly adhered to as in this Colony) they have run into the erroneous Practice of appealing on Matters of Fact, to the King in Privy Council. And we cannot but be of Opinion, that his Majeſty's Lieutenant Governor and Council, of this Colony, in the Execution of their important Truſt, ought in Obedience to his Majeſty's Inſtructions, and the Statute of the 7. &amp; 8. of W. 3. to be guided by the known and eſtabliſhed Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and not by the uncertain, and perhaps groundleſs Proceedings in other Colonies.</p>
                              <p>We cannot therefore agree with the Lieutenant Governor, when he ſays, in the next Paragraph.</p>
                              <q>It is evident from what has been ſaid, that no Writ of Error, can by the common Law lie in the Colonies, becauſe they are not Parcel of the Realm of <hi>England.</hi> No Act of Parliament has extended Writs of Error to the Colonies. The King has not given Authority to the Governor and Council of this Province, to hear and determine on Writs of Error — but has given them Authority to hear and determine on Appeals; their Authority is therefore clearly confined to Appeals, by which the whole Cauſe is brought before them, in order that if need be, it may be tranſmitted by farther Appeal, to the King in his Privy Council. — By what Authority, is the Governor and Council of <hi>New-York,</hi> appointed Judges in Error? I can ſee none — If neither Error nor Appeal lies, the Supreme Court becomes uncontroulable.</q>
                              <p>In Oppoſition to which, his Majeſty's Council are of Opinion, that Writs of Error did lie by the common Law, and that no other Writs, than Writs of Error, would lie by the common Law, from the inferior Dominion; becauſe the Latter is not Parcel of, but depends on the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; and that they lie <hi>ex Neceſſitate,</hi> becauſe the Law may not be changed, nor the Prince govern the inferior Dominion, which he holds <hi>Jure Coronae,</hi> otherwiſe than by the Laws of the ſuperior Dominion: That the Power of this Court, does not alone depend on his preſent moſt graciour

Majeſty's Royal Inſtructions, but was conferred in its original Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the Inſtructions of his royal Progenitors, and Predeceſſors, by which we are expreſsly and only authorized to take Cognizance, of Caſes of Error. That the Court being thus conſtituted, no Writ was neceſſary to be expreſsly directed, by royal Inſtructions, for <hi>Quando aliquid mandatur, mandatur et omne, per quod pervenitur ad illud.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>That his preſent Majeſty's Inſtruction, has a neceſſary Relation to former Inſtructions, becauſe it concerns a Court, which had a Being before the iſſuing of the preſent Inſtruction; and becauſe it has a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Reference to the antient Practice of this Court, <hi>in directing the uſual Writ to be iſſued</hi>; that this Court has no Authority to hear, and determine on Appeals not known in the Law; and by Writ of Error, the Judges of the Supreme Court will be effectually controuled; becauſe by the Law of the Land, they can only err in Matters of Law, upon which either a Demurrer, ſpecial Verdict, or Bill of Exception, will in all Caſes furniſh this Court in the Exerciſe of its proper Juriſdiction, with every Opportunity of correcting their Miſtakes in Law.</p>
                              <p>But as his Honour has thought proper, to conſider more particularly what was offered by thoſe Judges in Conſtruction of his Majeſty's 32d Inſtruction, it will be proper to ſet forth the Paragraphs on that Head, and give them a particular Anſwer, they run in theſe Words:</p>
                              <q>
                                 <p>What has been ſaid I think ſufficient—But to remove all Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties I can on this Head, I ſhall next conſider the Conſtruction, which the Judges of the Supreme Court have put on the King's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; for their Purpoſe they have gone back to preceding Inſtructions; tho' I think that no Argument from thence can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive. It is ſaid that the Words, <hi>in Caſe of Errors,</hi> being added in the former Inſtructions, after the Word <hi>Appeal,</hi> the Senſe of this laſt Word muſt be reſtrained to ſhew, that the Deſign of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is to confine the Governor and Council to the Rules obſerved on Writs of Error. But in Law, the Word Appeal has a certain and determined Signification: The Word Error is often taken gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to ſignify any Miſtake, and it cannot be confined to the Senſe in which Error, is uſed in a Writ of Error, ſince no Writ of Error lies in the Colonies.</p>
                                 <p>The next Argument, is from the following Words, in the Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>to iſſue a Writ in the Manner, which has been uſually accuſtomed:</hi>
                                    <pb n="47" facs="unknown:041438_0051_101A89405CE7F2B8"/>
The Meaning muſt certainly be in the Manner uſually accuſtomed in Appeals, not in the Manner uſually accuſtomed in this Place, as is pretended; for when the firſt Inſtruction was given, there could be no accuſtomed Manner in this Place, and it cannot at any Time be intended, if the accuſtomed Manner was erroneous as it certainly is, if it be by Writ of Error. Beſides, the Uſage in this Place is ſo weak, and of ſo ſhort Continuance, that it can be of no Force.</p>
                                 <p>But that the Word Appeal, in the Inſtruction, is taken in its pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>per Senſe, is evident from the other Words in the Inſtruction, which cannot he applied to a Writ of Error, viz. <hi>Appellant</hi> and <hi>Appellee,</hi> Terms never uſed on a Writ of Error, and the Word <hi>Condemnation,</hi> which indicates a new Judgment on the Merits.</p>
                              </q>
                              <p>His Majeſty's Council have already remarked, that this Court was not erected by his preſent Majeſty, but was many Years ago, erected and confirmed as a Court of Errors in expreſs Terms, by his Majeſty's royal Predeceſſors and Progenitors: In this View it was a proper com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law Court, at the Time when his preſent Majeſty iſſued his royal Inſtruction.</p>
                              <p>And therefore, tho' we agree that the Word Appeal, has in Law a certain and determined Senſe, yet as that Word in its legal Senſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily confined to Matters of Law, and as his Majeſty's Council dare not give into ſo bold an Opinion, that his Majeſty by his Inſtruction, <hi>intended to change the Law, and introduce Appeals upon Matters of Fact, unknown to the Laws of England</hi>; they think it their Duty to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Word <hi>Appeal</hi> in the preſent, as the Word <hi>Appeal,</hi> in Caſes of Errors ought to be underſtood in the former Inſtruction: And tho' his Honour does not underſtand the Word Errors, in the former Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as having any Relation to Writs of Error, but in the vulgar Senſe as ſignifying any Miſtake, whether in Law or Fact; yet we cannot but be of Opinion, that the Word ought to be taken in its legal Senſe; becauſe any other Appeal is not known in the common Law, than an Appeal for Errors in Law, and we think it our Duty to make the Law, and not vulgar Practice, the Rule for conſtruing as well the former, as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent royal Inſtruction; and that the more particularly, becauſe the very Purport and Deſign of both, appear to be the Correction of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Courts of Law, for which Reaſon the Judges of thoſe
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:041438_0052_101A8941EFF54090"/>
Courts are expreſsly prohibited from voting in the Court of Appeals, tho' they may attend to aſſign the Reaſons of their Judgments; and this not only proves (as the Judges have juſtly obſerved) that the Appeal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in his Majeſty's 32d Inſtruction, muſt be on Matters in which they are incompetent, by having rendered their Judgment already, <hi>to wit,</hi> on Matters of Law, but alſo that the Appeals directed being from Courts of Law, and from the Judgments of thoſe Courts, in the rendering of which Judgments there cannot in the Nature of Things be any thing cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible, but Errors in Law; the Words <hi>Appeal</hi> in <hi>Caſes</hi> of <hi>Errors,</hi> in the old Inſtruction, and the Word <hi>Appeal</hi> in the preſent Inſtruction, muſt be underſtood in the ſame Senſe. Nor can we think it juſt to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to prove that the Word <hi>Errors</hi> in the old Inſtruction is not to be taken in its legal Senſe, by aſſerting, that Writs of Error do not he in the Colonies, becauſe, whether they will lie or not, is to be determined by that Inſtruction. For if thereby a Court of Errors is eſtabliſhed, as it clearly is, the Writ of Error is of Courſe given by neceſſary Implication, agreeable the Maxim already mentioned; <hi>Quando aliquid mandatur, mandatur, &amp; omne per quod pervenitur ad illud,</hi> and another Maxim to the ſame Effect, <hi>quicunque aliquid alicui concedit, concedere videtur, et id ſine quo Res ipſa eſſe non poteſt,</hi> and it is evident, that Writs of Error are eſſential to Courts of Error, becauſe they can exerciſe no Juriſdiction in Erro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                                    <desc>••</desc>
                                 </gap>, but by a Writ of Error, to bring the Cauſe before them.</p>
                              <p>What his Honour has been pleaſed to remark, on the Clauſe in his preſent Majeſty's Inſtruction, whereby the Governor or Commander in Chief is directed to iſſue, <hi>a Writ in the Manner which has been uſually accuſtomed,</hi> might be fully anſwered, by ſimply obſerving, that tho' we ſhould agree with the Lieutenant Governor, that thoſe Words muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in the Manner uſually accuſtomed in Appeals: Yet as the common Law knows of no other Appeals than for Errors in Matters of Law, the Writ uſually accuſtomed by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> muſt be the Writ intended, which in Appeals from Courts of Record is a Writ of Error.</p>
                              <p>But beſides this, it may not be amiſs to obſerve, that his Honour's reaſoning on this Head, is grounded on a palpable Miſtake in Fact; for the old Inſtruction does not contain ſuch a Clauſe as he ſuppoſes.</p>
                              <p>The Chain of reaſoning therefore on this Point is juſtly this; by the old Inſtruction a Court of Errors is expreſsly erected, and conſequently the ſame Inſtruction gives a Writ of Error by neceſſary Implication; the
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:041438_0053_101A8945170E1980"/>
Court of Appeals ſpoken of in the preſent Inſtruction, muſt neceſſarily be the Court of Errors mentioned in the old Inſtruction, becauſe it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects the accuſtomed Writ, and therefore the accuſtomed Writ mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the preſent Inſtruction, muſt neceſſarily intend the Writ of Error implicitly given by the other, and uſed in Conſequence thereof, in a Courſe of Practice for many Years: So that there can be no Reaſon to ſuppoſe that the Writ which has been uſually iſſued was erroneous, or that the iſſuing of that Writ at preſent, muſt defend ſolely on what he ſuppoſes to be the ſhort, tho' continued Uſage in this Colony.</p>
                              <p>And that Appeals for Error will lie in the Colonies, and that the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of bringing them has been long ſince uſed in the Colonies, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of by the King in privy Council, will appear from the Caſe of one <hi>Jeoffry Jones,</hi> which was an Ejectment for Lands, brought in the Reign of King <hi>William</hi> III. in <hi>New-Jerſey,</hi> and in which Cauſe a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict was found and Judgment given, and the Judgment was on an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to his Majeſty in privy Council, afterwards reverſed for Error.</p>
                              <p>Hence therefore the Argument drawn from the Words <hi>Appellant</hi> and <hi>Appellee</hi> in the royal Inſtruction, muſt be of little Weight; for beſides that the old Inſtruction, which expreſsly, and only relates to Caſes of Error, contains the ſame Words, it is evident, that if, in Law, the carrying up of a Cauſe by Writ of Error, is an Appeal, the Party Plaintiff muſt be the <hi>Appellant,</hi> and the Defendant the <hi>Appellee</hi>: Nor will the Word <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,</hi> in the Inſtruction, furniſh the leaſt. Argument in Favour of the Lieutenant Governor's Conſtruction; becauſe, by that Word, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputably intended the Judgment in the Court below, as will appear from the whole Clauſe, which directs, that the Appeal ſhall be allowed, if the Party Appellant gives Security; (1ſt) to proſecute his Appeal to Effect: 2dly, to anſwer the Condemnation, and pay the Damages and Coſts, it the firſt Sentence be affirmed. His Honour next proceeds to conſider ſome, and not the moſt concluſive Arguments urged by the Judges, <hi>ab inconvenienti,</hi> upon which he Remarks thus;</p>
                              <q>
                                 <p>The next Arguments againſt Appeals are from Inconveniency; tho' they be not material, yet as they may have more Weight than they ought to have, they deſerve a diſtinct Anſwer.</p>
                                 <p>The firſt is from the great Expence Appeals muſt occaſion; to this may be anſwered, that in the Colonies, where Appeals are in Uſe, and
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:041438_0054_101A8946FB2E5C30"/>
where preparatory to an Appeal, the Evidence of Witneſſes is at the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of either Party taken down in Writing, in the common Law Courts, the Expence is not near ſo great, as in common Suits in this Province; this Expence then muſt be owing to ſome other Cauſe.</p>
                                 <p>It is again objected, that if Appeals be allowed, the Governor and Council, and afterwards the Privy Council in <hi>England,</hi> muſt ſit every Day in the Year, to hear and determine them.—The Supreme Court in this Province ſits at moſt only ſix Weeks, in the whole Year; ſuppoſe an Appeal in every Cauſe, (an abſurd Suppoſition) the Trial on Appeal cannot take up ſo much Time as in the Supreme Court, for the Formalities to bring the Cauſe to Iſſue, are unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in judging on the Merits.</p>
                              </q>
                              <p>With Reſpect to his Honour's Remarks upon the Argument drawn from the Expence that would attend Appeals, in the <hi>Pretorian</hi> Way, it may be anſwered; that tho' the Proſecution of common Suits, in the neighbouring Colonies, is leſs expenſive than in this Colony, yet we are far from believing, that the Charge of proſecuting an Appeal in thoſe Colonies would be leſs expenſive, than the Trial of an ordinary Cauſe in this. And though the Law is generally cheaper in ordinary Caſes, in thoſe Colonies, than in this, yet we conceive that the little Expence which there attends a common Suit, is one of the greateſt Evils under which they labour; as by that Means great Encouragement is given to a litigious Spirit, and has been ſo far improved to the Diſadvantage of the Colony of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> that Three Thouſand Six Hundred Writs have been returned at the Seſſions of one of their County Courts; which we believe may be truly ſaid, to exceed the Number of Writs that are iſſued <hi>communibus Annis</hi> by all the Courts of this Colony, from the higheſt to the loweſt. But at the ſame Time we are of Opinion, that tho' the great Cheapneſs of Law is a real Diſadvantage to any Country; yet we think that the Encouragement of Appeals in the <hi>Pretorian</hi> Way, would be an Expence too exceſſive to be born by the Subject; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would furniſh juſt Ground for the Argument <hi>ab inconvenienti.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The Argument urged by the Judges, from the Inconvenience that would attend a continual Seſſion of the Governor and Council, and of the King in privy Council, for hearing and determining Appeals, we think has been greatly miſunderſtood; for with Reſpect to the Governor and

                              <p>But his Honour has in his Reaſons omitted the Conſideration of thoſe of the Arguments <hi>ab inconvenienti</hi> which have the greateſt Weight. We cannot however avoid concluding with the Judges, that the Appeal contended for, would render the Expence of Trials by Jury uſeleſs, and therefore intolerable, and by making the Cauſe on Appeal, <hi>Res integra,</hi> would open a Flood-Gate to Perjury, encourage a Spirit of Litigiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and introduce Idleneſs, to the Ruin of many Families, and the great Impoveriſhment of the Country, and would be attended with the utmoſt Danger to the Subject, in the Tranſmiſſion of original Deeds; the Inſpection of which is often Times abſolutely neceſſary (as where a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure is the Gift of the Controverſy) in Order to do Juſtice to the Cauſe: Beſides this, the Benefit of a View not only appointed by the common Law, but by Statute, in Land Trials, would be loſt to the Subject, on every ſuch Appeal. And therefore, as long as there is any truth in the Maxim, <hi>quod eſt inconveniens &amp; contra Rationem, non eſt permiſſum in Lege,</hi> an Appeal on Matters of Fact, being attended with theſe Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies cannot lie.—</p>
                              <p>His Honour proceeds next, to conſider what he allows to be the principal Objection againſt an Appeal on Matters of Fact, on which he ſpeaks thus.</p>
                              <p>"I come now to the principal Objection, and which has the greateſt Weight, that by Judgment on Appeals, the great Privilege of Trial by Jury is taken away, <hi>the great Privilege which Engliſhmen enjoy above all other Nations</hi>: On this Head ſeveral Things deſerve Conſideration."</p>
                              <p n="1">1ſt.
<q>The Character of the Perſons who Judge on Appeals; the Gentlemen of the Council in this Province, and the privy Council in <hi>England,</hi> where on hearing of Appeals, the Lord high Chancellor,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:041438_0056_101A894BB4053320"/>
the Chief Juſtices of both Benches, and the Lords of greateſt Skill and Knowledge in the Law, uſually attend: With ſuch Judges, the Verdict of the Jury-will always have its juſt Weight: Few Men in any difficult Caſe would not rather truſt to ſuch Judges than to the uſual Juries in this Country. It is evident from the 33d Inſtruction, that the King really intended the Benefit of his People, not any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to himſelf, by ordering Appeals; for the 33d Inſtruction, gives an Appeal in Caſes of exceſſive Fines in a leſs Sum, than in Caſes of Property: And the King muſt have deſigned that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Cauſe ſhould come before him by the Appeal, otherwiſe he cannot Judge whether the Fine be exceſſive or not.</q>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <q>I believe that there is not a Man in this Province converſant in the Courts of common Law, who will not allow, that many iniquitous or falſe Verdicts have been given in it, and thereby great Injuſtice done. By the Laws of <hi>England</hi> every Wrong has its Remedy; what is the Remedy in this Caſe? They tell us the Judge will give a new Trial: But this Remedy depends upon the Will and Pleaſure of the Judge; if he will not, the Subject has no Remedy. The Law of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> abhors all arbitrary Power, and therefore the King has given his Subjects in the Colonies a Right to Appeal from every iniquitous Verdict, without depending on the good Will or Pleaſure of any Judge. If no Appeals are allowed from the Supreme Court of <hi>New-York,</hi> the Court muſt become uncontroulable; however agreeable this may be to Judges fond of Power, it muſt be terrible to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under their Juriſdiction.</q>
                              </p>
                              <p>His Majeſty's Council are ſeriouſly of Opinion, that the Privilege of Trials by Juries, which <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> enjoy above all other Nations, is <hi>in Truth a great and excellent Privilege</hi>: It is a Privilege which ſtands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by the Experience of many Ages, and by the tendereſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of our Anceſtors, for whoſe Judgment we have the higheſt Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: It is in ſhort the Birth-right of every <hi>Britiſh</hi> Subject, and ought to be maintained with the moſt unrelenting Firmneſs: But what is ſtill more, it ſtands fixed, irrevocably fixed, by the known and eſtabliſhed Laws of the Land, which the moſt cogent Reaſons can never enable a Governor and Council to alter. Little therefore will it avail in Favour of an Appeal, that the Characters of thoſe who would in ſuch Caſe be the Judges, are conſpicuouſly eminent and unexceptionable, or that ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitous Verdicts are ſometimes given by Juries, or that Men in a difficult
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:041438_0057_101A895043682588"/>
Caſe would rather ſubmit their Property to the Judgment of the Former than the Latter; for beſides, that none can be ſo competent Judges of the Matters of Fact as thoſe of the Neighbourhood, who are acquainted with the Parties, and the Witneſſes, and often Times with the Matter in Controverſy itſelf; and beſides alſo the great Security to the Subject, which conſiſts in ſubmitting the Trial of Facts to one Set of Men, and the Determination of the Law upon thoſe Facts to another, (which are Reaſons that at firſt View give a Preference to Trials by Juries) the Impoſſibility of a Change, even in Favour of a Method, if any ſuch could be deviſed, that would deſerve a Preference, muſt be a ſufficient Anſwer to any Thing that can be offered on this Head. The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and Council are <hi>Jus dicere &amp; non Jus dare,</hi> and their judicial Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity ſeems to have been deſigned in the original Conſtitution of this Colony, and in Imitation of the Houſe of Lords, as the dernier Reſort in the Colony, ſubject however to the Correction of a ſuperior Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory in <hi>England,</hi> as eſſentially neceſſary for the Preſervation of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence; nor can the Crown (we ſay it with the moſt profound Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion) change the Law of the Land, becauſe the King can do no Wrong. Any Thing ſhort of Legiſlative Authority, would be inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to ſo important a Purpoſe, and tho' his Majeſty may have thought proper to grant Appeals in Caſes of Fines, and that perhaps in the Senſe contended for by the Lieutenant Governor; yet, this is not in Derogation of the Rights of the Subject, but the Effect of his Majeſty's Royal Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency. By the Policy of Law, all Fines belong to the Crown, and as the King may remit them when he pleaſes, either in Part or in the Whole, he may without affording them any Cauſe of Complaint, and in Eaſe of the Subjects, direct ſuch a Method of enquiring into the Merits of the Cauſe, as he thinks proper, to enable him to judge on the <hi>Quantum</hi> of the Fine impoſed.</p>
                              <p>With Reſpect to unjuſt or iniquitous Verdicts, the common and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Law of <hi>England,</hi> as well as the Practice of the King's Courts, have provided ample Security againſt them; for beſides the Remedy by new Trials which his Honour ſuppoſes to be inadequate to the Evil, becauſe it depends upon the Will and Pleaſure of the Judge; the heavy Sentence which the Law inflicts by Attaint upon Juries who give iniquitous Verdicts, muſt be an effectual Redreſs; the Verdicts impeached by At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taint, being Matters of Fact, are corrected by another Jury of Twenty-four Men, and the Manner of the Correction proves the ſtrict Attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Law to the Rule, <hi>ad Quaeſtionem Facti, reſpondent Juratores,</hi>
                                 <pb n="54" facs="unknown:041438_0058_101A8951CBDBA500"/>
the Reverſal of the Judgment given in the firſt Inſtance, which is always the Conſequence of an Attaint proſecuted with Effect, furniſhes the moſt ample Security to the Subject, and ſatisfies the Demands of the Laws of <hi>England, which abhor all arbitrary Power.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The evil Conſequences of diſhoneſt Verdicts being therefore ſo effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually guarded againſt by Law, we cannot be of Opinion that his Majeſty ever intended by a Deviation from the eſtabliſhed Law of the Land, to give his Subjects in the Colonies a Right to Appeal from iniquitous Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts, in a Method unknown in the Law, and never applied in Eaſe of the Subjects in the Mother Country, who are doubtleſs entitled to an equal Share of the Royal Favour with his Majeſty's American Subjects; and that in every Inſtance of Practice, wherein Errors in Fact are to be corrected, the Office is by Law impoſed on a Jury of the Country, is manifeſted in every Caſe of Error, <hi>Quod coram vobis reſidet</hi>; for when a Man aſſigns Errors in Fact, he ought to put himſelf upon the Country, for the Jurors ſhall only be Triers of that, and not the Judges, Yelv. 58. Law of Er. 10.</p>
                              <p>And on <hi>audita Querela,</hi> which is alſo grounded on Matter of Fact, a Jury is ever to determine; as if a Releaſe of a Debt given after Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is alledged by the Party in Bar of Execution, a Jury muſt try the Fact, whether the Releaſe was executed or not.</p>
                              <p>In ſhort, the common Law knows of no other Appeals on Matters of Fact from common Law Courts, than by Attaint, Error, <hi>Quod coram vobis reſidet,</hi> and Writ of <hi>audita Querela,</hi> on all which, Juries determine; while on the other Hand, a Cauſe of Errors in Law is never brought before the Judges, but by <hi>Writ of Error, falſe Judgment, or Certiorari,</hi> and from Courts of Record, ſuch as our Supreme Court is, by Writ of Error only, 2. <hi>Bacon, Abr. Title Errors</hi> 189.</p>
                              <p>His Majeſty's Council are far from maintaining that no Appeals ſhould be allowed from the Supreme Court of <hi>New-York,</hi> nor can we believe that the Judges of that Court did ever affect ſo dangerous an Exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; on the Contrary, we are of Opinion with thoſe Judges, that <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals by Writs of Error,</hi> will undoubtedly lie from their Judgments, <hi>and will effectually prevent that Court from becoming uncontroulable.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The Method of Trials by Juries we think of ſo much Conſequence, that we cannot diſmiſs the Subject, without animadverting on the Cloſe of
<pb facs="unknown:041438_0059_101A8954349257F0"/>
his Honour's Reaſons, which were they well grounded, would naturally bring this excellent Method of Trial into Diſcredit. His Words are theſe;</p>
                              <q>
                                 <p>Many of the Counties of <hi>England,</hi> tho' they be not of ſo great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Territory, are more conſiderable in Numbers of People, Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Perſons, and Value of Property, than this Province is; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the Inconveniencies may happen in this Province, which did in the Counties of <hi>England,</hi> while all the Property in thoſe Counties were determined by Judges of the ſame County. I ſhall recite them in the Words of Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Hale, viz.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>All the Buſineſs of any Moment was carried by Factions, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: For the Freeholders being generally the Judges, and converſing one among another, and being as it were the Chief Judges, not only of the Fact, but of the Law; every Man that had a Suit there, ſped according as he could make Parties, and Men of great Power and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the County, did eaſily overbear others in their own Cauſes, or in ſuch wherein they were intereſted, either by Relation of Kindred, Tenure, Service, Dependence, or Application; the Remedy againſt theſe Evils which then prevailed, was by Appeal to the King.</p>
                              </q>
                              <p>

                              <p>That the Evils thus complained of by Lord <hi>Hale,</hi> happened in a very remote Period, when Ignorance and Barbarity overſpread the Nation in general; in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> II. which commenced above 600 Years ago, Learning was wholly ingroſſed by the Lawyers and the Clergy; the Freeholders of the Counties who were the Suitors to the inferior Courts, were both Triers of the Facts, and ſole Judges of the Law; and in Courts where Ignorance preſided, and the Judges were of inferior Rank, and owed this Service by the Tenure of their Eſtates under the me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>ne Lord, it was not to be wondered at, <hi>That Buſineſs was carried by Parties and Factions, nor that every Man ſped in his Suit according as he could make Parties, or had Intereſt in the County</hi>; but that the Ignorance of the Judges, and not the ill Conſequence reſulting from Trials by Juries, is the Evil complained of by Lord <hi>Hale,</hi>

                                 </note> appears clearly from the Account he gives in the ſame Page, of the Method taken by the King to Redreſs the Evil; <hi>therefore</hi> ſays the Author,
<q>The King took another and more effectual Courſe, for in the 23d Year of his Reign, by Advice of his Parliament, held
<pb facs="unknown:041438_0060_101A89576B77CEC0"/>
at <hi>Northampton,</hi> he inſtituted Juſtices <hi>itinerant,</hi> dividing the Kingdom into ſix Circuits, and to every Circuit, allotting three Judges, <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or experienced in the Laws of the Realm.</hi>
                                 </q>
Nor can it be thought probable, that ſo eminent and able a Judge as Lord <hi>Hale,</hi> could be ſo inconſiſtent with himſelf, as to diſparage a Method of Trial, which he has taken Pains to diſplay in every poſſible advantageous Point of Light; and for this Purpoſe, has devoted a whole Chapter in his excellent Book, called,<note place="margin">See Chap. <hi>12.</hi>

                              <p>To ſum up the Whole, his Majeſty's Council are clearly of Opinion, 1ſt. That omitting the Defects contained in the Inſtruments under Seal, by which an Appeal is ſought in the preſent Caſe, an Appeal from the Verdict of a Jury, taking the Word in any Senſe, is not known in the Law of <hi>England,</hi> it having been the eſtabliſhed and continual Practice, from Time immemorial, to try and determine all Facts by Juries.</p>
                              <p n="2">2dly. That the Statute of the 7 and 8 W.

That his Majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's Inſtruction, in which the Governor or Commander in Chief is directed to take Care, that no Man's Life, Members, Freehold, or Goods be taken away, or harmed, otherwiſe than by eſtabliſhed and known Laws, not repugnant to, but as much as may be, agreeable to the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> (which is ſimilar to every Inſtruction hitherto known to us, that has been iſſued on that Subject ſince the paſſing of that Statute) is ſupported by the aforeſaid Statute, and is calculated to enforce an Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to it.</p>
                              <p n="4">4thly. That in Conſequence of the aforeſaid Statute and Inſtructions, not only the Laws of the Colony, but the Practice of it's Courts, have always been in the ſtricteſt poſſible Conformity to the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and the Practice of the King's Courts there.</p>

That the Terms of his Majeſty's 32d Inſtruction, have a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Reference to ſuch Appeals as were known to the Law of <hi>England,</hi> and had been long uſed in this Colony; and that no other Appeals than in Caſes of Error in Law (which are the only Caſes of Appeal provided for in former Inſtructions) have, until the preſent Inſtance, ever been brought here.</p>

                              <p n="8">8thly. That tho' ſtrictly ſpeaking, there are ſeveral Species of Appeals, known in the Law, which are therefore generally called by their peculiar Names, yet the Inſtances are numerous in the Books, to prove that the carrying up of a Cauſe by Writ of Error, is in Law called an Appeal.</p>
                              <p n="9">9thly. That wherever an Appeal is on Matters of Fact, as in <hi>Attaint, audita Querela</hi> and Error, <hi>Quod coram vobis reſidet,</hi> the Errors are correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, not by the Judges, but by the Inqueſt of a Jury.</p>

That Appeals on Matters of Fact, would not only be inconſiſtent with Law, the Royal Inſtructions, and the ſtanding Practice of this Colony, but would be burthenſome and ruinous to the Subject, by rendering the firſt Trial uſeleſs, procraſtinating Juſtice, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hancing the Coſts of Suit, and opening a wide Door for Perjury on the ſecond Trial.</p>

Lawyer; but as I was but juſt returned from the Country, and had but little Time amidſt the Multiplicity of Buſineſs which a long and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected Abſence crowded upon me, to prepare for this extraordinary Occaſion, it was the beſt I could then produce, tho' I was ſure what I aſſerted was well founded. I could indeed have produced ſeveral other Dictionaries, but as they all made Uſe of the very Words of <hi>Cowel,</hi> and referred to no Authorities, I laid no great Streſs on them. I have now an Opportunity of confirming what I then ſaid, by one of the beſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities in the Law, my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Hale</hi>: And for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I beg Leave to read two Paſſages in his Hiſtory of the common Law, Page 150, and Page 48. [Here they were read.] Theſe Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities I ſuppoſe will be a full Confirmation of what I have advanced; and will ſhow that this Appellant is very much miſtaken in his Explanation of this Inſtruction.</p>
                                 <p>For let it be admitted, as I think it certainly muſt after what I have ſhewn, that there are Appeals at common Law as well as in the civil Law, is it not evident to a Demonſtration, that when it ſays you ſhall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Appeals from the Courts of common Law, that it muſt mean ſuch Appeals as are known to the common Law? And if Writs of Error are called Appeals in the common Law, to prove which an unexceptionable Authority has juſt been produced, and the Inſtruction ſays, that for the Purpoſe of Appeals, you are to iſſue a Writ in the Manner which has been uſually accuſtomed; does it not appear clear as the Sun, that Writs of Error, or ſuch Writs as are known to the common Law, are hereby directed to be iſſued? The contrary Explanation muſt appear to your Honours very unnatural, <hi>to wit,</hi> tho' there are Appeals by the common Law, as well as in the civil Law, yet, when it ſays you are to admit Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals from <hi>common Law Courts,</hi> it means you are to admit them in the <hi>civil Law Form.</hi> It means you are to direct the common Law Courts to change the whole Form of their Proceedings in order to comply with the Inſtruction, and to form a motley Court which ſhall partake of the Inconveniencies of both the others, and enjoy the Advantages of neither. It means when it directs you to ſend the uſual Writ, that you ſhall ſend ſuch a Writ, as both for Matter and Form never was ſent to any common Law Court before.

Lawyer gives, why Cauſes ſhould not come before the Parliament, in the firſt Inſtance is, becauſe by that Means the Subject would loſe his Trial <hi>per Pares,</hi> and conſequently his Attaint, in Caſe of a Miſtake in Point of Iſſue or Damages, to both which he is intitled by Law. Here we ſee Chief Juſtice <hi>Hale</hi> poſitively ſays, that the Subject is intitled to a Trial by his Equals, that is, by a Jury, and alſo to his Attaint in Caſe of a Miſtake in Point of Iſſue or Damages. If this be a good Reaſon in the Caſe here mentioned, it is alſo a good Reaſon againſt trying the Merits of Verdicts in the Court pretended to be erected by this Inſtruction; for tho' this does not deprive the Subject of a Trial by a Jury, yet it does much worſe, it puts him to all the Inconveniencies of that Trial, renders it prodigiouſly more expenſive than ever; and then makes it entirely uſeleſs. And it takes away the Remedy by Attaint, which is alſo here ſaid to be the Subject's Right; for to what Purpoſe would it be to bring an Attaint againſt a Jury for giving a Verdict, which whatever it may coſt, is not worth one Farthing to either Party, ſince the Matter muſt be finally determined by another Set of Judges; who for all Matters of Moment will become the ſtanding Jury in all Caſes without being liable to any ſuch Penalty. And thus we ſhould be deprived of Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges which his Honour agrees with every Body elſe we ought to enjoy, becauſe they are ſuch as we are intitled to by the common Law, in the moſt confined Senſe of the Word.</p>
                                 <p>'Tis true it may be ſaid, that the Right to bring an Attaint is not to be conſidered, becauſe in a very long Series of Years, no ſuch Action has been brought. But it cannot be denied, that the Privilege of a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Laws of <hi>England</hi> is very great, in this, that he cannot be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted of any Part of his Property but by the Judgment of his Peers, and they not only under the ſacred Obligation of an Oath, but alſo under the Danger of an Attaint if they give a falſe Verdict. And this is a Privilege no Man in his Wits will ever willingly part with, who knows its Value.</p>
                                 <p>For whatever Contempt may be put on Juries, in the Law they are of the higheſt Eſtimation, and no one ought to pretend to be wiſer than the Law. The greateſt Men have ever valued it as the beſt Way of trying Facts. And the Lord Chancellor himſelf, when a Fact is in Iſſue before him, delivers it to the King's Bench to be tried by a Jury. But the Advantages of this Trial by Juries, are ſo well deſcribed by Chief Juſtice <hi>Hale,</hi> in his 12th Chap. of the Hiſtory of the common Law, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready read in this Court, that I dare not preſume to do Injury to the Subject, by Encomiums unworthy of its Excellency.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <pb n="61" facs="unknown:041438_0065_101A5EDBAAC42A78"/>This Chief Juſtice, on whom no Man who has not made the Law his Study, ought to be aſhamed to pin his Faith, prized Trials by Juries ſo highly, that in order to ſhew the Excellency of the common above the civil and other Laws, he pitches upon this and Deſcents, as two of its principal Perfections.</p>
                                 <p>Therefore, your Honours will put too great a Value on this Privilege, to regard, in determining this moſt important Point, what is done in other Colonies; becauſe, they have no Power to alter our Laws. If Cauſes are brought up by Way of Appeal from Verdicts in ſome of them; if two or three contradictory Verdicts are taken in the ſame Cauſe in others; your Honours will clearly ſee the Abſurdity of ſuch a Practice; and while you leave them to plead either Ignorance or Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity for not conforming to the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> expreſsly enjoined by his Majeſty's Inſtructions to his Governors, you will zealouſly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, according to his moſt gracious Majeſty's Intentions, and Favour to us, every Practice conſonant to thoſe whoſeſome Laws.</p>
                                 <p>Neither is this Appeal in any Manner favoured by <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and therefore nothing ſurpriſed me more than to find that quoted in Favour of an Appeal. The Clauſe <hi>nulli vendemus, nulli negabimus, aut deferemus Juſtitiam,</hi> does no more prove that the King is to try every Cauſe himſelf, than every Writ or Pleading does, which ſuppoſes him preſent in all his Courts of Juſtice. This appears from my Lord <hi>Coke</hi>'s Comment on thoſe Words. And to ſhew how little <hi>Magna Charta</hi> favours ſuch an Appeal as this, I will read the whole Clauſe from which theſe Words are taken, and a Part of my Lord <hi>Coke</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon it. The Clauſe runs thus, <hi>Nullus liber Homo capiatur, vel impriſonetur, aut diſſeiſiatur de libero Tenemento ſuo, vel Libertatibus, vel liberis Conſuetudinibus ſuis; aut utlagetur, aut exuletur, aut aliquo Mode deſtruatur; nec ſuper eum ibimus, nec ſuper eum mittemus, niſi per legale Judicium Parium ſuorum, vel per Legem Terrae; nulli vendemus, nulli ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabimus, aut deferemus, Juſtitiam, vel rectum.</hi> On which my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> ſays, "againſt this antient and fundamental Law, and in the Face thereof, I find an Act of Parliament made, that as well Juſtices of Aſſize as Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices of Peace, without any finding or Preſentment by the Verdict of twelve Men, upon a bare Information for the King before them made, ſhould have full Power and Authority by their Diſcretions, to hear and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine all Offences and Contempts committed or done by any Perſon or Perſons, agiainſt the Form, Ordinance and Effect of any Statute made and

not repealed, &amp;c. by Colour of which Act ſhaking this fundamental Law, it is not credible what horrible Oppreſſions and Exactions to the Undoing of infinite Numbers of People were committed by Sir <hi>Richard Empſon,</hi> Knight, and <hi>Edmund Dudley,</hi> being Juſtices of Peace throughout <hi>England</hi>; and upon this unjuſt and injurious Act, (as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in like Caſes it falleth out) a new Office was created, and they made Maſters of the King's Forfeitures. But at the Parliament holden in the Firſt Year of H. VIII. this Act 11, H.

                                    </gap>d Informations, had been purſued againſt divers of the King's Subjects, to their great Damage and wrongful Vexation: And the ill Succeſs hereof, and the fearful End of theſe two Oppreſſors, ſhould deter others from committing the like, and admoniſh Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that inſtead of this ordinary and precious Trial <hi>per Legem Terrae,</hi> they bring not in abſolute and partial Trials by Diſcretion." In ſhort, whoever will ſupport a Practice of this Nature, ought by no Means to refer to Books of the Law; for the Laws of <hi>England</hi> abhor it, and bear Teſtimony againſt it in every Page. Neither can it be ſupported by advancing new Principles, ſuch as theſe. 1ſt. The common Law ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to the Plantations, but the Statute Law does not. 2dly. The Laws of <hi>England</hi> extend to the Plantations, but the Execution being in the King, he can erect what Courts for the Diſtribution of Juſtice he pleaſes. Principles new as theſe are, unheard, unthought of, before this important Trial between <hi>Thomas Forſey</hi> and <hi>Waddel Cunningham,</hi> one would think needed ſome Proof, ſome Authority at leaſt to eſtabliſh them; for certainly they are not ſelf-evident Propoſitions. But nothing of the Sort have I heard. On the Contrary, it is ſuppoſed by all Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that Colonies carry out with them the Laws of their Mother Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. And if they do, they muſt take thoſe with them, which are in Force at the Time they emigrate, becauſe they are familiar and known. They can never upon their Emigration be obliged to have Recourſe to thoſe Rudiments of Law, which were firſt formed by their Mother Country. They can hardly be ſuppoſed to be ſo well acquainted with Antiquity as to know what they are. Neither can any good Reaſon be given, why they ſhould not reap the Advantages of all the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made by ſucceeding Ages. Beſides, no Man can draw the Line between thoſe Laws which ſtand upon the Authority of Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that of the common Law: For many Things are by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law which firſt commenced by Acts of Parliament; many ſeem
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:041438_0067_101A896C434BD770"/>
to ſtand on the Authority of Acts of Parliament, which were before by common Law. So that this Principle, if adopted, would produce more Confuſion than a ſudden Repeal of all Laws: By theſe Means the Trials by Battle, and Fire Ordeal, would be again introduced. In ſhort it is not poſſible to ſuppoſe that our moſt gracious Sovereign, when by his Inſtructions he directed that the Laws ſhould be adminiſtered in a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod as nearly as poſſible according to the Laws in <hi>England,</hi> intended we ſhould conform to all the Adſurdities of an ignorant Age. No, his gracious Intentions doubtleſs were, that we ſhould enjoy the Benefit of thoſe Laws, which by the Improvement of many Ages were wrought up to the higheſt Perfection, and by this he conferred on us the greateſt Bleſſing which his princely Wiſdom could beſtow, and took the beſt Method of ſecuring the Dependence of the Colonies. So prepoſterous is it to ſuppoſe that it would be ſecured by depriving the People of this Colony of the Laws of <hi>England.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>As for the other Principle, that the King can erect what Courts he pleaſes for the Diſtribution of Juſtice, it is not only contrary to Law, but it is big with the moſt dangerous Conſequences. The King it is true is the Fountain of Juſtice, and the Execution of the Law is in him, by the Conſtitution of <hi>England</hi>; but the Mode of diſpenſing it is fixed by Law, and unalterable, but by Act of Parliament. He may erect as many new Courts as he pleaſes, but they muſt determine accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Courſe of the common Law, and proceed on Facts found by Juries. But that he can erect Courts which ſhall have a Power to try Cauſes in what Manner they pleaſe, muſt appear extremely ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ear, and to any one who has the leaſt Idea of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſtitution. This is expreſsly provided againſt by <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> as appears by the Authority juſt now read. On this Principle a Court ſimilar to the Inquiſition might be erected, and Torture intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. By theſe Means the grand Difference between an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and a Subject of <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> or <hi>Turkey,</hi> would be annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for that conſiſts more in the Mode of adminiſtering Juſtice to them, than in the Laws themſelves. Happy for us we live under a Monarch patriotic and beneficent, who glories in being the Sovereign of Free-Men, not of Slaves; and will reject with Abhorrence every Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive which may be exerted to the Ruin of his Subjects. Of this we had an ample Proof, when one of the firſt Acts of his Reign was to ſecure the Independence of the Judges, by parting with what was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Prerogative of his Crown; and I dare venture to propheſy
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:041438_0068_101A896EAAA20448"/>
that whoever ſeeks to recommend himſelf to his moſt gracious Majeſty's Favour, by undertaking to prove that his Subjects are no better ſecured in their Liberties and Eſtates than thoſe of the moſt abſolute Monarchs, will appear to have taken the worſt Way of making his Court. —</p>
                                 <p>Before I conclude, as in the Proſecution of this Scheme, not only Juries but the Practiſers of the Law, and the Judges have been treated with Diſreſpect; Juſtice obliges me to ſay, that I have a pretty general Acquaintance with the Practiſers, eſpecially with thoſe that are moſt eminent, and that from what I have obſerved of their Conduct, I can declare, that I know none who do not behave themſelves with a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, Integrity, and Diſintereſtedneſs, which does Honour to their Profeſſion. And of this they have on this Occaſion exhibited a Proof. They ſuppoſe the Appeal now brought illegal and injurious to the Country, and for that Reaſon, not one of them could be prevailed on to give his Aſſiſtance to, but all rejected the Project with Diſdain. This will long be remembered to their Honour.</p>
                                 <p>As for the Judges they or ſome of them are reproached, as forgetting their Duty in endeavouring to raiſe the Paſſions: On which I ſhall obſerve in the Words of a great Lawyer; that a Judge is not to be defamed or vilified with Reſpect to his Parts, Fitneſs for his Place, &amp;c. for if this were allowed, it would be impoſſible to keep in the People that Veneration for their Perſons, and Submiſſion to their Judgments, without which it is impoſſible to execute the Laws with Vigour and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. What Grounds there are for accuſing them of raiſing the Paſſions I know not. When ſuch Principles are advanced as tend to overturn a Conſtitution, of which every <hi>Engliſhman</hi> is fond, his Reſentment will naturally be raiſed; and when the Miſchiefs ariſing from ſuch Principles are either ſhewn or hinted at, his Anger will be ſtill more inflamed. But who ought to be accuſed of raiſing the Paſſions when this is the Caſe, I muſt ſubmit to the ſerious Conſideration of your Honours. Certainly our Duty obliges us to preſent to your Honours a full View of the Inconveniencies which muſt attend this Alteration of the Law.</p>
                                 <p>It does a peculiar Honour to Juries, Lawyers, and Judges, that thoſe who impeach their Conduct, declare againſt the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> that excellent Syſtem which can hardly be conſidered without Admiration, or ſpoke of without Rapture, and which our moſt Gracious King is ſo far from endeavouring to deprive us of, that he has particularly directed his
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:041438_0069_101A8970682C7838"/>
Governors to conform to them as much as poſſible, by an Inſtruction, which lately and accidentally came to our Knowledge, whereby his Go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vernor or Commander in Chief, is directed to take Care that no Man's Life, Member, Freehold, or Goods, be taken away or harmed in this Province otherwiſe than by the eſtabliſhed and known Laws, not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to, but as nearly as poſſible, conformable to the Laws of <hi>England.</hi> This ſhows the Propriety of the Obſervation, that the Judges ought not to be directed in their Duty by ſuch Scraps of Inſtructions as may from Time to Time be communicated to them: For had we been directed in our Conduct by the Thirty-ſecond Inſtruction, and miſunderſtood it, to ſignify in Appeal againſt a Verdict, we ſhould have introduced a Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, not only contrary to this Inſtruction by which the Laws of <hi>England</hi> are enforced, but to make Uſe of the Words of the Oracle of the Law, contrary to and in the face of <hi>Magna Charta.</hi> This Inſtruction alone I ſhould imagine would be a ſufficient Inducement to your Honours, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Practice of the Law here, in every Thing which is conſonant to the Laws at Home.</p>

                                 <p>This Act I hope will be ſufficient to anſwer the Objections of the moſt ſcrupulous; for it appears not only to be made in order to prevent ſuch Appeals as are now contended for, but alſo in Affirmance of the common Law.
