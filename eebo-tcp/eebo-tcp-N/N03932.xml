            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Their Land is tolerably good and lies very near the River. They already provide Food, and, ere long, will be capable of providing Raiment for themſelves. I ſhall ſend them up Cotton, Spinning-Wheels and a Loom, to begin a Manufactory; and next Year, I hope, their own Land will produce enough Flax, Cotton, &amp;c. to carry it on.

                  <hi>Sunday, July</hi> 13. Preached this Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with much Power, and collected in the Evening for my poor <hi>Orphans.</hi> Great Numbers ſtood without the Doors, and it raining very hard in the Time of divine Service, many of them were driven away. However GOD cauſed the other People's Hearts to deviſe liberal Things, Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of <hi>Fifty Pounds Sterl.</hi> were collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the Occaſion.

               <p>In the Morning I went to Church, and heard the Commiſſary preach: But had ſome infernal Spirit been ſent to draw my Picture, I think it ſcarcely poſſible he could paint me in more horrid Colours. I think, if ever, then was the Time that all Manner of Evil was ſpoken againſt me falſly for CHRIST's Sake. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary

ſeem'd to ranſack Church Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for Inſtances of Enthuſiaſm and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Grace. He drew a Parallel between me and all the <hi>Oliverians, Ranters, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, French-Prophets,</hi> till he came down to a Family of the <hi>Dutarts,</hi> who lived not many Years ago in <hi>South-Carolina,</hi> and were guilty of the moſt notorious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſts and Murders. To the Honour of GOD's <hi>Free Grace</hi> be it ſpoken, whilſt he was repreſenting me thus, I felt the bleſſed Spirit ſtrength'ning and refreſhing my Soul. GOD at the ſame Time gave me to ſee what I was by Nature; how I had deſerved his eternal Wrath; and therefore I did not feel the leaſt Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the Preacher. No, I pitied, I prayed for him, and wiſhed from my Soul, that the LORD would convert him, as he did once the Perſecutor <hi>Saul,</hi> and let him know that it is JESUS whom he perſecutes. In the Evening many came, as I was informed, to hear what I would ſay; but as the Commiſſary hinted, that his Sermons ſhould be printed, and as they were full of invidious Falſhoods, I held my Tongue and made little or no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. <hi>Father forgive him, for he knows not what he does!</hi>

Being given to Hoſpitality, ſhe provided Food ſufficient for a great Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. People came from Town and all the other neighbouring Places. Her Barn was put into proper Order, and I read Prayers and preached in it, with much of GOD's bleſſed Spirit in my Soul. A lovely Melting was viſible in ſeveral Parts of the Auditory. After Sermon, GOD enabled me to ſpeak many Goſpel Truths a midſt a polite Set of People; and at the Requeſt of Madam <hi>Woodard</hi> I ſtayed all Night.

                  <hi>Tueſday, July</hi> 15. I appeared, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Citation, at the appointed Hour and Place. There were very many Spectators; and the Rev.

                  <pb n="20" facs="unknown:004846_0019_100E00B064C58748"/>
unheard. At this one of the Clergy ſneer'd; but the Commi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

After a ſhort Debate the Commiſſary ſent his Apparitor to his Houſe for his Commiſſion, in order to give me Satisfaction. In about a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an Hour he return'd, with ſeveral Bundles of Papers, out of which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary firſt produced his Commiſſion to act as Commiſſary from the Biſhop of <hi>London.</hi> I read and approved of it: But at the ſame Time deſired to be ſatisfied of the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi>'s Authority in this Province, not finding the Royal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority underwritten, as mention'd in his publick Citation: Upon this a Latin Commiſſion without a Seal, was order'd to be read by the Clerk of the Court. I objected, That it was in Latin contrary to our late Act, ordering every Thing to be in Engliſh; and not well underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Clerk as he read it, I deſired the Peruſal of it myſelf, which was granted. I read it with an audible Voice; and after reading it, I objected, That tho' there might be a general Power given to the Biſhop, to exerciſe eccleſiaſtical Juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this Province; yet the Extent of that Power was to be determined by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Acts of Aſſembly. I farther urged,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004846_0020_100E00B2A2A78948"/>
That a Court of this Nature was intirely unpreſidented in <hi>America</hi>: that I belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Georgia,</hi> a different Province, and was here only as an Itinerate. I alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, That my Lord of <hi>London,</hi> tho' I preached in the Fields for ſome Months, never attempted to exerciſe ſuch Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity againſt me. The Commiſſary repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Tho' I belonged to <hi>Georgia,</hi> yet I had committed Irregularities <hi>here,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore came under his Cognizance; and that what he had to lay to my Charge might be Crimes of a different Nature.</p>
               <p>Not ſatisfied with my Objections, he order'd the Clerk to minute down, That I contumaciouſly contemned the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Court. But I deſired that Expreſſion might be ſoftned, declaring from my Heart, That what I did, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from a real Scruple concerning their Authority, urging the Example of King <hi>Charles,</hi> who, before he made An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to his Accuſers, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſiſted on knowing the Authority his Judges had to call him to an Account. I further objected, That the Commiſſaries in <hi>Maryland</hi> and <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania</hi> were mere Cyphers, That the <hi>Truſtees,</hi> to my Knowledge, queſtion'd the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi>'s having any Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in theſe Parts; and that the Governor of <hi>Maryland,</hi> acting as Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004846_0021_100E00B4CD1359E0"/>
had ſummoned his Clergy lately to meet him as ſuch, which accordingly they did. I therefore upon the whole, humbly deſired, as a Favour from the Court, that I might have till to Morrow Nine a Clock, the Time to which the Court was adjourned, to inform myſelf of the Extent of their eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction in this Province, aſſuring them, that upon find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Authority valid, I would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately anſwer to any Interrogatories, and would be ready to receive any Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence they could with Juſtice paſs upon me. Tho' at my firſt aſking he ſaid, He had indulged me too far already; yet, after ſome Conſideration, Mr. Commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ordered the Clerk to raze out the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Minute, and to record, That upon my ſcrupling the Authority of the Court I was indulged my Requeſt.</p>
               <p>Our LORD was pleaſed to fulfil his Promiſe made to thoſe that ſhould be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led before Rulers and Governors for his Name-Sake. My Soul was full of Peace. I pitied, but did not feel the leaſt Emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Reſentment againſt my Judges. The People behaved pretty quiet; but ſome broke out into a Laughter, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing irregular, when I ſaid, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries in <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> and <hi>Maryland</hi> were but Cyphers. This I diſapproved
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004846_0022_100E00B65E2B82C0"/>
of, and checked immediately. After the Court was adjourned and the Commiſſary roſe from his Seat, I made my Obeiſance and returned to my Lodgings, thinking myſelf more highly honour'd, by my LORD, this Morning than in any other Part of my Life. <hi>LORD ſtrengthen me in all my other impending Trials, for thy great Name's Sake.</hi> Amen <hi>and</hi> Amen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wedneſday, July</hi> 16.

At firſt the Commiſſary refuſed to read it, inſiſting to know firſt whether I acknowledged the Authority of the Court? Unwarily I anſwer'd, Yes. But upon the Motion of my Advocate, Mr. <hi>Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> I recalled my W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rds and ſaid, I admitted and ſubmitted to an Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Court legally conſtituted. One of the Clergy on the Bench would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on my firſt Anſwer. But I told him, It was mean-ſpirited and beneath a Court, conſiſting of thoſe that called themſelves Miniſters of JESUS CHRIST, to catch at an Expreſſion which I imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately corrected. Upon this, the Bench agreed to alter the Minute agreeable to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004846_0023_100E00B88BDDEB08"/>
my laſt Declaration. The Commiſſary then took my Paper, read it to himſelf, and ſaid, he would not accept of it. I then ſtood up according to Law and ſaid, I would go and proteſt againſt all further Proceedings, as null and void, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately left the Court. Upon Mr. <hi>Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> his Advice I returned and declared, That I appealed <hi>apud acta</hi> to the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and then withdrew a ſecond Time.</p>
               <p>We had not gone far from the Place of Judicature, but I was called back by the Apparitor and Regiſter. We returned, and at the Commiſſary's Deſire gave in my Exceptions to be read and filed.</p>
               <p>By this Time Mr. Commiſſary had gotten one Mr. <hi>Graham,</hi> an Attorney, to appear in Behalf of the Court, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on having the Merits of my Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions tried in Court. But, as according to Law, I had referred them to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of Six Arbitrators, three no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by me, and three by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary, Mr. <hi>Rutledge,</hi> in my Behalf, proteſted againſt all further Proceedings, and againſt my appearing at the next Court, till my Reference to Arbitrators was complied with, it being quite impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable to imagine, that Mr. Commiſſary, who muſt be Judge (if my Exceptions

ſhould be tried by that Court) ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low himſelf prejudiced.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Recuſatio Judicis</hi> I exhibited by the Advice of my Friends, not to quibble with or evade the Force or Rigour of any Law whatſoever, that I might juſtly fall under. For when the Articles of Impeachment were read, I found myſelf accuſed only of omitting to read the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer in the <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> Meeting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at ſuch Times as I preached there. <hi>Oh that my Adverſaries may never have any Thing worſe to lay to my Charge!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Spectators were rather more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous than Yeſterday; they behaved quietly, and were much rejoiced to ſee my Oppoſers reduced to ſuch a Dilemma. Well ſaid the Pſalmiſt, <hi>the Wrath of Man ſhall turn to thy Praiſe. — Great GOD, the Remainder of it do thou reſtrain; and for thy own Name Sake deliver me from the Hands of unreaſonable Men, who, out of a miſguided Zeal and without Cauſe, are mine Enemies!</hi>

I replied, Did not <hi>Paul</hi> do ſo when he began to preach? In ſhort, all his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was ſo inconſiſtent, and contrary to the Goſpel of our LORD, that I was obliged to tell him, That I believed him to be an unconverted Man, an Enemy to GOD, and of a like Spirit with the

But alas! GOD ſoon ſhewed me, that the Time of my Departure was not yet at Hand: In a ſhort Time I perceived my Body grew ſtronger, and I was enabled to walk about.

                  <hi>Thurſday, Auguſt</hi> 7. Continued very weak ever ſince my Return from <hi>Charles-Town</hi>: But was much refreſhed this Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Sight of ſome dear Friends, (amongſt whom was one Mr. <hi>Tilly,</hi> a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Baptiſt Miniſter) who came in our Sloop to ſee the <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Sunday, Auguſt</hi> 3. Felt more than common of the Divine Preſence in my Soul ſince the Arrival of <hi>Charleſtown</hi> Friends; Who brought the <hi>Orphans</hi> many Preſents, and bleſſed GOD for the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of his Goodneſs and Providence plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcernable amongſt us. But laſt Night, through Weakneſs of Body, and a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Concern which lay upon my Soul on Account of ſome domeſtick Trials, juſt as I began Family Prayer, I was ſtruck, as I thought, almoſt for Death. I put up a few broken Accents, and breath'd out, <hi>LORD</hi> JESUS <hi>receive my Spirit.</hi> This Morning my Maſter ſhewed me
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:004846_0037_100E00D7641B6C68"/>
why I was thus humbled: Soon after I roſe, I found that Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> and his Wife of <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jonathan Bryan,</hi> Brother to Mr. <hi>Hugh Bryan,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Bull,</hi> were come to pay us a Viſit. Tho' exceeding weak, and I had almoſt laid aſide Thoughts of officiating this Day; yet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mr. <hi>Jones</hi>'s Intimating that Friends came expecting to hear me, I promiſed, if I could, to preach, and beg'd him to read Prayers: He did; but I found my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo ill that I would fain have perſuaded Mr. <hi>Tilly</hi> to preach for me: He peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily refuſed, urging that GOD would ſtrengthen me if I begun. Upon this I ſtood up, and ſoon found Power communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to me from above. I felt a ſweet Melting in my Soul: And 'ere I had pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed long Mr. <hi>Bull</hi> dropped down as tho' ſhot with a Gun. He ſoon got up, and ſat attentively to hear the Sermon. The Power ſoon ſpread abroad; the greateſt Part of the Congregation was under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern: Tears trickled down apace. GOD manifeſted himſelf alſo much amongſt us during the Time of the Sacrament. And I went home aſhamed that I was ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to preach. I ſtood juſtly reproved when Mr. <hi>Tilly</hi> after we came home, ſaid, <hi>Did I not tell you, GOD would ſtrengthen you? Deareſt-LORD for thy Mercies ſake
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:004846_0038_100E00D8EB357A48"/>
never let me diſtruſt thee again! Oh me of little Faith!</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Monday, Auguſt</hi> 4. Was ſent for about Noon to ſee Mr. <hi>Jonathan Bryan.</hi> At my Coming I found him under great Concern and ſtrong Convictions of Sin. Oh, how did he reflect on his paſt miſpent Life! How did he bleſs GOD<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for bringing him to <hi>Savannah!</hi> How did he deſire that he might be found in CHRIST 'ere he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home! His Wife ſat Weeping by, and Mr. <hi>Bull</hi> lay on a Bed, Groaning in Bitterneſs of Soul, under a Senſe of Guilt, and Crying out for an Intereſt in CHRIST. I aſked him what cauſed him to fall down Yeſterday: He anſwered, the Power of GOD's Word. After about half an Hour's Converſation on the Nature of the New-Birth, and the Neceſſity of a ſaving Cloſure with the LORD CHRIST, I kneeled down and prayed with them, and then took my Leave, hoping the LORD would pluck them as Fire-Brands out of the Fire. <hi>Even ſo,</hi> LORD JESUS. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men <hi>and</hi> Amen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sunday, Auguſt</hi> 9. Went on <hi>Tueſday</hi> with Mr. <hi>Bryan, Jones, &amp;c.</hi> to <hi>Betheſda,</hi> and had the Pleaſure of ſeeing the Work of GOD much carried on in moſt of our Viſiters Hearts. It was but ſeldom I could officiate, but when I did the LORD
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:004846_0039_100E00DBC9F03468"/>
generally cauſed the Word to come with very great Power. This Morning I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded early, as uſual, and read Part of the Prayers at Ten a Clock; but got Mr. <hi>Tilly</hi> to preach; who tho' a <hi>Baptiſt</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, joined with us in receiving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the <hi>Church of England</hi> Way.
<q>And the King was pleas'd to ſit at his Table. He brought us into his Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting-Houſe, and cauſed it to be a Feaſt of fat Things to our Souls.</q>
Many, I believe, fed on JESUS in their Hearts with Thankſgiving. After the Ordinance was over, the LORD enlarged my Heart, and I prayed as the Spirit gave me Utterance. I went home, much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed in Soul, but ſo weak in Body, that I declined going to publick Worſhip in the Afternoon. In the mean while, GOD gave me a freſh ſupply of Strength. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Evening, when my Friends were ſitting down together, finding the Power of the LORD come upon me, I began to ſpeak to them of the Things of GOD. A great Alteration was ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable in moſt of the Company. Their Concern gradually increaſed, till many burſt into Floods of Tears; and one fell on the Ground. 'Ere I had done, ſome of my Pariſhioners came up, and the reſt of my Family: They alſo felt the Divine
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:004846_0040_100E00DD52E1BD80"/>
Power. When I had done ſpeaking to them from GOD, I ſpoke for them in Prayer to GOD: My Soul was carried as it were out of the Body, and I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to wreſtle mightily with our LORD in their Behalf. He did not let us go without a Bleſſing. The Room was filled with the Cries of thoſe around me; and many, I believe, at that Time ſought JESUS Sorrowing. The Concern conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued after the Duty was over. Several were in great Agonies of Soul; and a <hi>Cherikee</hi> Indian-Trader, who providential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was preſent, deſired to ſpeak with me, ſaying, <hi>He never ſaw the like before.</hi> Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> alſo, of <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> who went away on <hi>Friday,</hi> but was forced back, and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated for me this Afternoon at <hi>Savannah,</hi> told a Friend, that <hi>Surely GOD was with us?</hi> Bleſſed be His rich, ſovereign and diſtinguiſhing Grace. <hi>LORD make me lowly in my own Eyes, and cauſe me ſtill to go on from Conquering to conquer! Not unto me: Not unto me; but unto thee, my King and my GOD, be all the Glory!</hi>

Trials this Week than ever I was viſited with before. Was forced, ſeveral Times, to come out, thro' Concern of Soul and Weakneſs of Body, in the Midſt of Publick Worſhip; and had not GOD uncommonly ſupported me, I muſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently have given up the Ghoſt. But as Troubles abounded, Conſolations abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo. Theſe Words, <hi>But</hi> David <hi>ſtrengthned himſelf in the LORD his GOD,</hi> were preſſed with a wonderful ſupporting Power upon my Soul. The <hi>Eleventh</hi> of <hi>Hebrews</hi> alſo was bleſſed to me; I found the Benefit of being afflicted, GOD en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled me to ſanctify him in my Heart; and my greateſt Grief was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I ſhould be ſo naughty as to oblige my Heavenly Father to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Adminiſter'd the bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and gave a cloſe Exhortation afterwards.

<pb n="43" facs="unknown:004846_0042_100E00E107F6B628"/>
and was ſo filled with the Love of CHRIST, in this Evening's Expoſition and my private Farewel-Diſcourſe to my Family, that I could almoſt ſay, I was within the Veil. My Hearers, both in private and publick, were vaſtly affected; and a ſtrange Woman was ſo touched, that ſhe came to me, confeſſing her Sins and crying out, <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> When I came to converſe with her, I found GOD had ſtruck her the laſt Time I preached at <hi>Port-Royal;</hi> and I hope he will now call her effectually by his Grace. Pleaſed, and I hope in ſome Meaſure thankful to the LORD of all LORDS, for ſetting ſuch Seals to my Miniſtry juſt at Departure. About Ten at Night I went on Board our Sloop with my other dear Viſitors, in order to go to <hi>Charles-Town,</hi> where, by the Advice of Friends, the Captain is to take in Freight for <hi>Boſton,</hi> for the Benefit of the <hi>Orphan-Houſe.

I retired a ſoon as poſſible to my old Lodgings, and ſpent the Evening moſt ſweetly at the Houſe of Mr. <hi>Fowler,</hi> where I hope many true Diſciples of the bleſſed JESUS were met together. The LORD, who once came to the Eleven by Night and ſaid, <hi>Peace be unto you,</hi> I am perſuaded by his Spirit ſpoke to many of them.

                  <hi>Monday, September</hi> 1. Being but weak in Body (except on Sundays) I have preached only once every Day; but I think with greater Power than ever, and with greater Succeſs. I ſcarce know the Time wherein I did not ſee a conſiderable Melting in ſome Part or other of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and often it ſpread over the whole. Several Times I was ſo weak be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I began to preach, that I thought it almoſt impoſſible I ſhould go through half a Diſcourſe; but the LORD quickened, enlightened and ſupported me above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Out of Weakneſs I became ſtrong, and the LORD manifeſted himſelf in the Sanctuary. The Audiences were more
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:004846_0044_100E00E591AE0BF8"/>
numerous than ever, and it was ſuppoſed not leſs than Four Thouſand were in and about the Meeting-Houſe when I preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Farewel-Sermon. The Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſary, having run his utmoſt Length, thought it beſt to ſay no more himſelf; but he employed one Mr. <hi>Rowe</hi> to preach for him, who told the People, that becauſe of their Wickedneſs, GOD had ſent them ſtrong Deluſion, that they might believe a Lie. Finding when I was here laſt, that JESUS CHRIST was not preached in the Church, my Conſcience would not ſuffer me to attend on thoſe that preach there any more: I therefore went to the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi> and <hi>Independant</hi> Meeting-Houſe, where JESUS CHRIST, I hope, was preached in Sincerity. I likewiſe adminiſtred the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament thrice in a private Houſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Yeſterday was ſeven-night, Yeſterday, and this Morning. Never did I ſee any Thing more ſolemn.

I willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complied, knowing it was a Thing quite indifferent. Many others hearing how GOD was amongſt us Yeſterday, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired I would adminiſter to them to Day. I did, and our Lord was with us again. Having more Leiſure from my private Studies, by Reaſon my Weakneſs would not permit me to read much, I had better Opportunities of converſing with, and confirming thoſe that were under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions. Moſt of them I found grown in Grace, and their Hearts ſoftned by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming Love. Mr. <hi>Jonathan Bryan</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bull</hi> came to <hi>Charleſtown,</hi> I hope, much eſtabliſhed Mr. <hi>Hugh Bryan</hi> they left ſick at Home, drinking deeply of the Cup: of GOD's Conſolations. His Wife came with them to <hi>Charleſtown</hi>: A gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Woman.

Every Night, where I was invited to Supper, it became cuſtomary to have the Houſe filled with Company, whom the LORD enabled me to pray with and exhort, with great Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; but once I was ſo weak, that I was obliged to be led Home. Many came to me in private under the deepeſt Convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Several were eſteemed mad by their Relations: One young Lady in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, for ſome little Time, was turned out of Doors, but afterwards was recalled again. And one Tradeſman, who was looked upon as a very-good Man, was convinced of his <hi>Self-Righteouſneſs</hi> in an extraordinary. Manner, and burnt near <hi>Forty Pounds</hi> Worth of Books, written by ſuch as <hi>Chub, Foſter,</hi> &amp;c. The Care which People expreſſed of my Heath and Preſervation, was uncommon.

after the Beginning of Evening Service. We came purpoſely thither firſt with our Sloop. I think it the moſt pleaſant En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance I ever yet ſaw. Almoſt. all the Morning the Wind was contrary; but I found a very ſtrong Inclination to pray<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we might arrive time enough to be preſent at publick Worſhip. Once I cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the People, but ſomething prevented their coming: At laſt, finding my Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion increaſe upon me, I deſired their Attendance immediately. They came. With a ſtrong Aſſurance that we ſhould be heard, we prayed, that the LORD would turn the Wind that we might give him Thanks in the great Congregation; and alſo, that he would ſend ſuch to us as he would have us to converſe with, and who might ſhew us a Lodging. Tho' the Wind was a-head when we began; yet, when we had done praying and come up out of the Cabbin, it was quite fair. With a gentle Gale we ſailed moſt pleaſantly into the Harbour, got into pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip before they had finiſhed the Pſalms, and ſat, as I thought, undiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd After Service was over, a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man aſked me, whether my Name was not <hi>Whitefield</hi>?

We then agreed to make Uſe of it, at Ten in the Morning and Three in the Afternoon. After this, I went and waited on the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, who ſeemed to be a very plain Man and had a very plain Houſe, which much pleaſed me. By Profeſſion I think, he is a <hi>Seventh-Day Baptiſt</hi>; he is a Man of good Report as to his Conduct and Dealing with the World. After a ſhort Viſit I returned to take my Leave of Mr. <hi>Honeyman,</hi> and to fetch my Friends, who were at his Houſe, waiting for me. We then went to the Houſe of Mr. <hi>Bourſe,</hi> who firſt ſpake to me when coming out of Church. The Houſe was ſoon filled with Company. I expounded and prayed with them for about an Hour, and then retired to a Lodging the LORD in his good Providence had provided for me. The bleſſed JESUS was pleaſed ſweetly to manifeſt himſelf to my Soul. A Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of his diſtinguiſhing, repeated

Mercies quite melted me down, and I called upon all that was within me to prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe his holy Name. <hi>O LORD, in the Night Seaſon, let me ariſe and give Thanks unto thee; and let my Talking be of thy loving Kindneſs and tender Mercies all the Day long!</hi>

                  <hi>Monday, Sept.</hi> 15. Breakfaſted this Morning with old Mr. <hi>Clap,</hi> and was much edified by his Converſation. I could not but think, whilſt at his Table, that I was ſitting with one of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs. He is full of Days, a Batchelor, and has been a Miniſter of a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> upwards of Forty Years. People of all Denominations, I find, reſpect him. He abounds in good Works, gives all away, and is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully tender of little Children: Many of them, of different Perſuaſions, come to be inſtructed by him. Whenever he dies, I am perſuaded, with good old <hi>Simeon,</hi> he will be enabled to ſay, <hi>LORD, now letteſt thou thy Servant depart in Peace.</hi> At Ten in the Morning and Three in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, according to Appointment, I read Prayers and preached in the Church: 'Tis very commodious, and, I believe, will contain 3000 People.

                  <hi>Tueſday, Sept,</hi> 16. Perceived my ſelf a little low in the Morning; but was enabled to read Prayers and preach with much Flame, Clearneſs and Power, to ſtill grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Auditors than Yeſterday. It being Aſſembly - Time, the Gentlemen ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed in order to attend the Service: And ſeveral Invitations were given me to come to other adjacent Places. The People were exceedingly attentive, Tears trickled down their Cheeks; and ſo far prevailed with me by their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, that, by the Divine Permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I promis'd to call on them in my Return from <hi>Boſton.</hi> When I came home to my Lodgings, the Woman of the Houſe ſaluted me with, <hi>Bleſſed art thou of the LORD.</hi> I looked round to ſee the Reaſon of ſuch a Salutation, and on the Couch there lay a young Woman.

Afterwards one or two more came under deep Convictions, crying out, in the Bitterneſs of their Souls, after the <hi>LORD</hi> JESUS. I prayed with each of them, and exhorted them not to reſt till they found Reſt in JESUS CHRIST. In the Evening I went, as I thought, privately, to a Friend's Houſe; but the People were ſo eager after the Word, that in a ſhort time, I believe, more than a thouſand were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Door, beſides thoſe that were within, and filled every Room in the

Bleſſed be GOD it was a very ſolemn Meeting. Being Night I could not ſee how the Hearers were affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but the LORD aſſiſted me in Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Glory be to his great Name!</hi> Before I retired to Bed, I went and took my Leave of Mr. <hi>Honyman</hi>; and had ſome cloſe Talk with him about the <hi>New-Birth.</hi> The LORD give him an experimental Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it! He was very civil, and would have had me ſtaid with him longer; but being to go on a Journey on the Morrow, after we had converſed about half an Hour, I took my Leave. At my Return to my Lodgings good old Mr. <hi>Clapp</hi> went with me in a Room, and gave me ſomething for my <hi>Orphans,</hi> and ſpoke many affectionate Things to me: Altho' very old, yet he followed me from one end of the Town to the other; ſo that People ſaid, I had made Mr. <hi>Clapp</hi> young again. <hi>Oh what a Crown of Glory is the hoary Head when found in the Way of Righteouſneſs!</hi> He was exceeding deſirous of my Coming to <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> again; which I promiſed to do by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Permiſſion: For <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> ſeems to be a Place where much good may be

I think there are no leſs than four different Congregations of of <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> two of the <hi>Independents,</hi> and one of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Perſuaſion. Dean <hi>Berkly's</hi> Name is had in much Reſpect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. The eſtabliſh'd Church is in good Order as to Externals: But many of the Head-Members, I ſoon found, were exceeding great Bigots; they ſeem'd very fearful leaſt I ſhould preach in Mr. <hi>Clapp's</hi> Meeting-Houſe, and glorified much in my bringing the good old Man to Church. Nor is there leſs Bigotry, as far as I could find, amongſt thoſe of other Communions: All, I fear, place the Kingdom of GOD too much in Meats and Drinks; and have an ill Name abroad for Running of Goods. One day, when I ſaid in my Sermon,
<q>What will become of you who cheat the King of his Taxes?</q>
the whole Congregation ſeemed ſurpriz'd, and looked on one another as though they ſhould ſay, We are guilty. LORD <hi>JESUS give them to know thee and the Power of thy Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and teach them to render unto</hi> Caeſar

Found the People were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed of my Coming, and were ſollicitous for my Preaching: But being reſolved, under GOD, if poſſible, to reach <hi>Boſton</hi> that Night, we travel'd on, for near fifty Miles, and came to <hi>Boſton</hi> about eight in the Evening. When we were within four Miles of the Town, the Governor's Son, and ſeveral other Gentlemen, and one or two-Miniſters, waited at a Gentleman's Houſe to give me the Meeting. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived me with great Gladneſs, and told me many more would have come, had not a large Funeral been in the Town, or if there had been more certain Notice of my Arriving. This rejoiced me: For I think I can ſtand any Thing better than this: It favours too much of human Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur: But I muſt be tried every Way. The LORD be my Helper. After ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping a little while, we went altogether in Company to <hi>Boſton,</hi> to the Houſe of one Mr. <hi>Staniford,</hi> Brother-in-Law to Dr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> who long ſince had ſent me an Invitation.

I replied, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it was valid. They then urged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me a Paſſage in my firſt Journal, where I ſaid that a <hi>Baptiſt</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Deal</hi> did not give me a ſatisfactory Anſwer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Miſſion: I anſwered, perhaps my Sentiments were altered. And is Mr. <hi>Weſley</hi> altered in his Sentiments too, ſaid one; for he was very ſtrenuous for the Church, and againſt all other Forms of Government, when he was at <hi>Boſton.</hi> I anſwered, he was then a great Bigot; but GOD had ſince enlarged his Heart, and, I believed, he was like minded with me, as to this Particular. I then urged, that a catholick Spirit was beſt; and that a <hi>Baptiſt</hi> Miniſter had communicated with me lately at <hi>Savannah.</hi> And, I ſuppoſe, ſays another Clergyman, you would do him as good a Turn and communicate with him. I anſwered, Yes. I then urged, that it was beſt to preach up the New-Birth, and the Power of Godlineſs; and not to inſiſt ſo much on the Form, for People would never be brought to one Mind as to that; nor did JESUS CHRIST ever intend it. Yes, but ſays Dr. <hi>Cutler,</hi>

He did. How do prove it? Why ſays he, our LORD prayed that all might be one, even as thou, Father and I are one. I replied, that was ſpoken of the inward Union of the Souls of Believers with JESUS CHRIST, and not of the outward Church. That cannot be, ſays Dr. <hi>Cutler</hi>; for how then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He then (taking it for granted, that the <hi>Church of England</hi> was the only true apoſtolical Church) drew a Parallel between the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and our Church, urging how GOD required all Things to be made according to the Pattern given on the Mount. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, before the Parallel could be juſt, it muſt be proved that every Thing enjoined in our Church was as much a Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution as any Rite or Ceremony under the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Diſpenſation. I added farther, that I ſaw regenerate Souls among the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> among the <hi>Preſbyterians,</hi> among the <hi>Independents,</hi> and among the Church-Folks: All Children of GOD, and yet all born again in a different Way of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and who then can tell which is the moſt Evangelical?

ſaid CHRIST was to make up the Defects of our Righteouſneſs. I aſked him if Converſion was not Inſtantaneous?

Then ſays I, according to your own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples Regeneration is Inſtantaneous; and ſince you will judge of the New-Birth by the Fruits, pray watch that Child, and ſee if it brings forth the Fruits of the Spirit. I alſo ſaid, that if every Child was really born again in Baptiſm, then every baptized Infant would be ſaved: And ſo they are, ſays Dr. <hi>Cutler.</hi> How do you prove that? Why, ſays he, the Rubrick ſays, that all Infants dying after Baptiſm, before they commit actual Sin are undoubtedly ſaved. I aſked what Text of Scripture there was to prove it. Here, ſays he, (holding a Prayer Book in his Hand) the Church ſays ſo. We then juſt hinted at Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination.

and again at my Lodging, as uſual, to a greater Company than before. Some afterwards came up into my Room. I felt much of the divine Preſence in my own Soul, and tho' hoarſe, was enabled to ſpeak with much Power, and could have ſpoke, I believe, till Midnight. To ſee the People ſo willing to hear makes me forget myſelf. <hi>Oh that it may be my Sleep, my Meat and Drink, to do the Will of my heavenly Father!

               <p>In the Afternoon I went to preach at Mr. <hi>Chickly</hi>'s Meeting-Houſe; but GOD was pleaſed to humble us by a very awful Providence: For, when the Meeting-Houſe was filled with People, tho' there was no real Danger, on a ſudden the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were all in an Uproar, and ſo unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countably

ſurprized, that ſome threw themſelves out of the Window, others threw themſelves out of the Gallery; and others trampled upon one another, ſo that ſome were actually killed, and others dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly wounded. I happen'd to come in the Midſt of the Uproar, and ſaw two or three lying on the Ground in a pitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Condition. GOD was pleaſed to give me Preſence of Mind, ſo that I gave No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, I would immediately preach on the Common. The Weather was wet, but about 8000 followed into the Field, to whom I preached from theſe. Words,
<q>— Go out into the Highways and Hedges, and compel them to come in.</q>
I endeavoured, as GOD enabled me, to improve what had befallen us; and tho' <hi>Satan</hi> in this has bruiſed our Heel, yet I doubt not, but even this will be a Means of bruiſing his accurſed Head. <hi>LORD, thy Judgments are like the great Deep!

               <p>In the Evening perceived myſelf weak in Body, ſo that I could not ſay much at the Houſe where I ſupped; but GOD by his bleſſed Spirit greatly refreſhed and comforted my Soul. <hi>Bleſſed be GOD,</hi> I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the Afternoon I preach'd again in the College Yard, without particular Application to the Students. I believe there were 7000 Hearers. The holy Spirit melted many Hearts.

Many Hearts melted within them, and I think I never was ſo drawn out to pray for and invite little Children to JESUS CHRIST as I was that Morning. A little before I had heard of a Child who was taken ſick juſt after it had heard me preach, and ſaid, He would go to Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi>'s GOD, and died in a ſhort Time.

The Governor was highly pleaſed to ſee the Power of GOD: He took his Leave in the moſt affectionate Manner, and ſaid, He would come and take me in his Coach to <hi>Charleſtown</hi> Ferry, the Morrow Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

already for CHRIST's Sake. <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be GOD</hi> for what he has done at <hi>Boſton!</hi> I hope a glorious Work is now begun, and that the LORD will ſtir up ſome faithful Labourers to carry it on. <hi>Boſton</hi> is a large populous Place; very wealthy; has the Form kept up very well; but has loſt much of the Power of Religion. I have not heard of any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Stir in it for theſe many Years. Miniſters and People are obliged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that the Love of many is waxed cold. Both, for the Generality, ſeem'd too much conform'd to the World. There's much of the Pride of Life to be ſeen in their Aſſemblies. Jewels, Patches and gay Apparel are commonly worn by the female Sex. Little Boys and Girls I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved commonly dreſſed up in the Pride of Life; and the little Infants that were brought to Baptiſm, were wrapped in ſuch fine Things, and ſo much Pains ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to dreſs them, that one would think, they were brought thither to be <hi>initiated into</hi> rather than <hi>renounce</hi> the Pomps and Vanities of this wiched World. There are Nine Meeting-Houſes of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational Perſuaſion; one <hi>Baptiſt</hi>; one <hi>French,</hi> and one belonging to the <hi>Scotch Iriſh.</hi> There are two monthly and one weekly Lecture, and that too but poorly

attended. Several Miniſters complain'd to me of it. I mentioned it in my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and I truſt GOD will ſtir up the People, more frequently to tread the Courts of the LORD's Houſe. One Thing <hi>Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> is remarkable for, The external Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the <hi>Sabbath.</hi> Men in Civil Offices have a Regard for Religion. The Governor encourages them; and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Magiſtrates ſeem to be more united than in any other Place where I have been. Both were exceedingly civil to me during my Stay. I never ſaw ſo little Scoffing, never had ſo little Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But one might eaſily foreſee, much Oppoſition will hereafter ariſe, when I come to be more particular in my Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to particular Perſons: For I fear many, many reſt in a Head-Knowledge, are cloſe Phariſees, having only a Name to live. It muſt needs be ſo, when the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Godlineſs is dwindled away, and the Form only of Religion is become faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able amongſt a People. However, no doubt there are a few Names left in <hi>Sardis,</hi> that have not defiled their Garments. Many Letters came to me, as far as I could judge, from truly p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Friday, Octob.</hi> 17. Set out as ſoon as it was Light, and reached <hi>Hadley,</hi> a Place where a great Work of GOD was begun ſome Years ago; but lately the People of GOD have complain'd of Deadneſs, and loſing their firſt Love. However, as ſoon as I mentioned what GOD had done for their Souls formerly, it was like putting Fire to Tinder; the Remembrance of it quicken'd them and cauſed many of them to weep ſorely. When I had taken a little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment, we croſſed the Ferry to <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton,</hi> where no leſs than 300 Souls, as was ſuppoſed were ſavingly brought home to the dear LORD JESUS, about 5 of 6 Years ago. Their Paſtor's Name is <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi> Succeſſor and Grandſon to the great <hi>Stoddard,</hi> whoſe Memory will be always precious to my Soul; whoſe Books, enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, <hi>A Guide to</hi> CHRIST, <hi>and Safety of appearing in</hi> CHRIST's <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> I would earneſtly recommend to all. Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> is a ſolid excellent Chriſtian; but at preſent weak in Body: I think I may ſay, I have not ſeen his Fellow in all <hi>New-England.</hi> When I came into his Pulpit I found my Heart drawn out to talk of ſcarce any think beſides the Conſolations and Priviledges of Saints, and the plentiful

Effuſſion of the Holy Ghoſt in the Hearts of Believers: And when I came to remind them of their former Experiences, and how zealous and lively they were at that Time, both Minſters and People wept much, and the Holy Ghoſt enabled me to ſpeak with a great deal of Power. In the Evening I gave a Word of Exhortation to ſeveral that came to Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s Houſe. My Body was ſomewhat weak, my Appetite almoſt gone; but my LORD gave me Meat to eat which the World knows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of. <hi>LORD, evermore give me this Bread!</hi> Amen <hi>and</hi> Amen.</p>

GOD's Power was with me both Times, eſpecially at the laſt. My Soul was much carried out in Prayer, and the LORD ſo ſtrengthen'd me in the inner Man, that I could have preach'd another Sermon after I had done. A little after I left <hi>Spring-fields,</hi> my Horſe coming over a Bridge threw me over his Head, directly upon my Noſe: The Fall ſtunned me for a while. My Mouth was full of Duſt.

I inſiſted much in my Diſcourſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Doctrine of the New-Birth, and alſo the Neceſſity of a Miniſter's being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, before he could preach CHRIST aright.

upon the People in all Parts of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. Many Miniſters were preſent. I did not ſpare them. Moſt of them thanked me for my plain Dealing; but one was offended, and ſo would more of his Stamp if I was to continue longer in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>: For unconverted Miniſters are the Bane of the Chriſtian Church: And tho' I honour the Memory of that great and good Man Mr. <hi>Stoddard,</hi> yet I think he is much to be blamed for endeavouring to prove that unconverted Men might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Miniſtry. How he has handled the Controverſy I know not. I think, no ſolid Arguments can be brought to defend ſuch a Cauſe: But the beſt of Men are permitted to err, that we may know they were but Men. A Sermon lately publiſhed by Mr. <hi>Gilbert Tennent,</hi> entitled, <hi>The Danger of an unconverted Miniſtry,</hi> I think unanſwerable. As I was Riding to <hi>Windſor,</hi> after Dinner, an old Man came up to me, ſaying, He knew that what I had preached in the Morning was true; I have felt it, ſays he: I was under the Spirit of Bondage 20 Years, and have received the Spirit of Adoption 23 Years.

I preach'd in the Afternoon, and with ſuch Freedom, that a young Miniſter, who had heard me ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Times, told me, I had kept the good Wine until now. As ſoon as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon was over, I rode about a Mile, croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a broad Ferry, walked about a Mile and a half, and preached to a thronged Congregation, belonging to old Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi> Father to Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> of <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton,</hi> and, I believe, a true Diſciple of the <hi>LORD</hi> JESUS CHRIST. My Body being ſomething weak, I did not ſpeak with that Strength as laſt Night, neither was I ſo much aſſiſted: But it is the LORD. He knows beſt when to diſpenſe, and when to ſuſpend his Aids. After Exerciſe I ſupped at the Houſe of old Mr. <hi>Edwards:</hi> His Wife, I believe, was as aged as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and, if ſhe was converted, and I know nothing to the contrary, I fancied I was ſitting in the Houſe of a <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth.</hi> Indeed I felt great Satisfaction in my own Soul; and parted from him and his Son (who came with me ſo far) with ſome inward Regret.

About Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven o'Clock preached again in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, at <hi>Wallingford,</hi> Fourteen Miles from <hi>Middletown,</hi> and then rode on to <hi>New-Haven,</hi> Fourteen Miles further, were I was affectionately received by Mr. <hi>Pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pont,</hi> Brother to Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton.</hi> As I came along I found won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful

Freedom in my Soul, for declining to go ſo long a Circuit as was propoſed. I converſed profitably with Mr. <hi>Lamb,</hi> a godly, zealous Miniſter of <hi>Guilford</hi>; and when I came to <hi>New-Haven,</hi> I felt GOD ſtrengthen'd my inner Man. I wreſtled in Prayer in Company with my dear Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Travellers, and am perſuaded the LORD did not let us go without a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. <hi>Oh that we may all ſit down in the Kingdom of Heaven!</hi>

to have ſome Experience of divine Things, came to converſe with me; and in the Evening I expounded at my Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Room full of People.

I felt his Letter, and now alſo felt the Man. My Soul was much united to him. I could not but think, GOD would do great Things by his Hands. He has had a remarkable Work in his Pariſh ſome time ago, and talked like one that was no Novice in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Things. With him I dined at Mr. <hi>Clap</hi>'s, Rector of <hi>New-Haven</hi> College, about one third as big as that at <hi>Cambridge.</hi> It has one Rector, three Tutors and about 100 Students. But I hear of no remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Concern amongſt them on Account of Religion. I preached twice, and, I believe, much to the Conſolation of GOD's People; many of which, as I have heard, live in <hi>New-Haven</hi> and the Countries round about. There were ſweet Melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings

diſcernable both Times. I ſpoke very cloſely to the Students, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the dreadful Inconveniency of an unconverted Miniſtry. Dear Mr. <hi>Mills</hi> and another Miniſter came to my Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings after Sermon: They rejoiced in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and Mr. <hi>Mills,</hi> when he took his Leave, told me of one Miniſter in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, who had been wrought upon before, but now was gone Home as full as he could hold. <hi>O that GOD may quicken Miniſters!

Preached both Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Evening to much larger Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations than before, and in the Afternoon obſerved an eſpecial Preſence of GOD in the Aſſembly. Many, I believe, were comforted and quicken'd by the Holy. Ghoſt. The People of GOD ſent me Word that they were much revived; and one came and told me, theſe Words were lately preſſed upon her Heart, <hi>The Winter is gone, the Spring is at Hand, the Voice of the Turtle is heard in the Land.</hi> Indeed I believe this will be an acceptable Year of the LORD. Before Evening Service, the following Note was put into my Hands, by one who came to me a Day or two ago, ſome Miles off, under great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs,

The Preſence of GOD was much in the Aſſembly, which was large. Many Miniſters were preſent, and they could not help glorifying GOD much on my Behalf. Dear Mr. <hi>Mills,</hi> who came again to meet me this Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was much affected; and as I was riding out of Town, a godly Gentleman met me, and with Tears in his Eyes, at length out of the Abundance of his Heart, ſaid, <hi>I never ſaw GOD's Preſence in the Sanctuary on this wiſe before. I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced the Words you ſpoke; but never heard them ſo well cleared up, nor felt them ſo powerfully ſet home upon my Soul. It has been a bleſſed Time to my Soul</hi>; or Words to that Effect. In the Afternoon I preached at <hi>Stra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Both Places, eſpecially the latter, I found, were ill reported of, for their leaning too much towards <hi>Arminian</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. <hi>O LORD, convince them of the Rottenneſs of ſuch a Foundation, and bring them to know the Truth as it is in</hi> JESUS.</p>

In the Afternoon. at <hi>Norwalk,</hi> Twelve Miles from <hi>Fairfield,</hi> I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd much both in Prayer and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

When the Spirit of Prayer began to be loſt, then Forms of Prayer were invented. And, I believe, the ſame Obſervation will hold good as to Preaching. As for the Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I believe, it may be ſaid, their Light is now become Darkneſs, Darkneſs that may be felt, and is complain'd of by the moſt godly Miniſters. I pray GOD theſe Fountains may be purified, and ſend forth pure Streams to water the City of our GOD.
