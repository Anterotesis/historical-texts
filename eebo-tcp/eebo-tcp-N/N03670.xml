            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Our <hi>dear People,</hi> Your <hi>Miniſters</hi> have with Pleaſure ſeen you in the Weeks paſt, Old and Young, Parents and Children, Maſters and Servants, high and low, rich

            <p>The <hi>Fame</hi> of a ſingular fervent and <hi>holy Youth,</hi> an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Servant and Miniſter of JESUS CHRIST, (who makes his <hi>Angels Spirits,</hi> and his <hi>Miniſters a Flame of Fire)</hi> had prepar'd you for his <hi>Viſit;</hi> and with raiſed Expectations we received him, even as an <hi>Angel of</hi> GOD for JESUS ſake; as the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> was received by the Churches in <hi>Galatia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GOD gave him a wonderful <hi>Manner of Entrance</hi> among us, juſt as in other Places before us, among the <hi>Brethren</hi> of our Denomination; and we were ſometimes <hi>melted</hi> together in Tears, Miniſters and People, Parents and Children, under the commanding <hi>Addreſſes of Love</hi> to his <hi>Saviour</hi> and our <hi>Souls.</hi> We led you with a viſible Pleaſure in our Faces to the ſolemn and great <hi>Aſſemblies,</hi> and look'd on You there with great Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, in your uncommon Regards to the Beloved <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of</hi> CHRIST, for the <hi>Truth's ſake that dwelleth</hi> in Him, and the <hi>Love of the Spirit</hi> filling him, and reigning in his Miniſtrations to us.</p>
            <p>And now our beloved <hi>Brethren and Siſters,</hi> You and your <hi>Children,</hi> we are going to <hi>prove,</hi> confirm and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, by the Will of GOD, the ſeeming good Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions begun or revived in You, toward CHRIST and his <hi>Word,</hi> in a juſt and reaſonable pious Care and <hi>Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude</hi> for your Salvation.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> once and again in his <hi>Admonitions</hi> to You, and alſo in his <hi>fervent,</hi> righteous and <hi>effectual Prayers</hi> for you (by the Will of GOD) led you into <hi>this Trial</hi> and Proof of your ſelves;—"Whether when he was gone from us, you wou'd <hi>better attend</hi> on the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of your <hi>own Paſtors,</hi> both on <hi>Sabbaths</hi> and <hi>Lectures?</hi> For he had <hi>heard</hi> (and it was but too <hi>true</hi>) that there had been a very great <hi>Defect</hi> in this Point among you
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004490_0005_100D585EE3A751C0"/>before he came.—Some of your <hi>Miniſters</hi> therefore now make a new <hi>Tender</hi> of themſelves to you, in the Fear and Love of GOD, in this <hi>new Lecture,</hi> for the Service of your Souls, if you will encourage them by ſomething of a <hi>like Attendance</hi> on it, as we have lately ſeen you give to the Word preach'd. — We preach the ſame CHRIST, the ſame <hi>Doctrines of Grace,</hi> and <hi>according to Godlineſs,</hi> with the ſame Goſpel <hi>Motives</hi> and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Applications to Conſcience, and Supplications to GOD for You.— We would look on the <hi>Fields,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them <hi>white</hi> for the <hi>Harveſt,</hi> and deſire to <hi>enter</hi> into it; if by the Help of GOD we may <hi>cheriſh</hi> the Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions made on any of your Souls, and carry them on, clinching the <hi>Nails</hi> driven by the <hi>Maſter of Aſſemblies</hi> that has been ſent among us.—For though we are <hi>Elder Miniſters,</hi> and have been many Years before Him in the Service of Souls, and <hi>He</hi> like <hi>David</hi> going againſt <hi>Goliah,</hi> in the Sight of the <hi>Armies of Iſrael,</hi> has been ſeen to be but a <hi>Youth</hi> and <hi>Stripling;</hi> yet are we not unwilling or aſhamed to come and ſerve <hi>after Him,</hi> in the <hi>Battles</hi> of our LORD, and in the <hi>Victories</hi> of his Grace. — You have ſeen, as it were, a young <hi>Elias,</hi> or the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> riſen again, a <hi>burning and ſhining Light,</hi> and you were <hi>willing for the Seaſon to rejoice in his Light and Heat:</hi> May <hi>we</hi> now <hi>preach</hi> and <hi>you hear</hi> for the <hi>future</hi> with more Life and Spirit, Diligence and Conſtancy; and by the Will of GOD with new <hi>Succeſs.</hi>— But we mean not, <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> at <hi>this Lecture</hi> only, but on <hi>every</hi> Sabbath and <hi>every</hi> Lecture in the Town; and more particularly on the public <hi>Thurſday Lecture;</hi> which has been ſhamefully neglected by the <hi>Town.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To come then to my <hi>Text,</hi> which I acknowledge the late <hi>Concourſe</hi> to the <hi>Word</hi> among us, has led me to chuſe. I wou'd now look round on the <hi>preſent Aſſembly,</hi> and look back on our <hi>paſt</hi> Aſſemblies, and ſay to You,—</p>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Prophet</hi> was here meditating the <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in the abundant <hi>Acceſs of the Gentiles</hi> to it.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004490_0006_100D58611B4DBF00"/>
               <hi>Ariſe, ſhine,</hi> (ſays he Ver. 1.) <hi>for thy Light is come, and the Glory of the</hi> LORD <hi>is riſen upon thee.</hi> It was a <hi>light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome</hi> Thought to the holy Prophet, the <hi>inlarged</hi> State of the Church, after its long <hi>Confinement</hi> within the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Bounds of <hi>Judea;</hi> and after its Diminution and <hi>Obſcuration</hi> by the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity. He foretels, <hi>V.</hi> 2, this Time of <hi>Darkneſs</hi> covering the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>groſs Darkneſs the People;</hi> out of which the Church ſhou'd <hi>emerge,</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles come to her Light, and Kings to the Brightneſs of her riſing.</hi> Ver. 3.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, <hi>Ver.</hi> 4, ſhe is call'd upon to <hi>lift up her Eyes,</hi> and <hi>ſee round about,</hi> the People gathering and <hi>flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> to her. And though at <hi>firſt</hi> there might be ſome <hi>Fear</hi> and Diſtruſt, as <hi>Peter</hi> felt, when he was about to go unto the <hi>Uncircumciſed;</hi> yet that wou'd be <hi>ſoon over,</hi> and her narrow <hi>doubting</hi> Heart <hi>enlarg'd</hi> with Joy; (<hi>V.</hi> 5.) becauſe of the <hi>Abundance of the Sea,</hi> and the <hi>Forces of the Gentiles,</hi> coming to her.— This Acceſſion of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> to CHRIST is further repreſented, <hi>Ver.</hi> 6, 7, by the <hi>Multitudes of Camels, laden with Incenſe</hi> and <hi>Offerings of Gold;</hi> and the <hi>Flocks of Kedar</hi> preſenting themſelves for <hi>Sacrifices</hi> to the <hi>Altar</hi> of GOD. The Riches of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> together with their Hearts, devoted to GOD in and through CHRIST, for the ſetting up and ſupporting his <hi>Inſtituted Worſhip,</hi> is the Thing here repreſented.</p>
            <p>And thus (ſays the HOLY ONE, in the Words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately preceeding my Text) <hi>will I glorify the Houſe of my Glory.</hi>—GOD'S <hi>Church</hi> is the Houſe of his <hi>Glory,</hi> where he is <hi>glorified</hi> by his People, and where he <hi>glorifies</hi> himſelf in his <hi>Grace</hi> to them. The <hi>Promiſe</hi> is here, to make it <hi>more glorious</hi> than ever. The <hi>Chriſtian Church State</hi> makes it ſo: The <hi>Miniſtration</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> was <hi>glorious,</hi> but the <hi>Goſpel exceeds in Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the <hi>Viſion of this</hi> it is, that the <hi>Prophet</hi> as in a Surprize and Extaſy <hi>exclaims,</hi> in the Words of my Text, "<hi>Who are theſe that fly as a Cloud, and as the Doves is their Windows.</hi> He mightily admires this <hi>flocking of Converts to</hi> CHRIST.
<q>The <hi>Manner</hi> wherein he
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004490_0007_100D5863E23E8290"/>expreſſes his <hi>Admiration</hi> is more <hi>elegant</hi> and moving, than if he had only ſaid,— I ſee an <hi>infinite Number</hi> coming into the Church. He ſpeaks <hi>magnificently</hi> of the thing, ſays <hi>Calvin,</hi> and as wanting Words to utter his Wonder and Joy.</q>— When the <hi>Church</hi> return'd from <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſhe left many a <hi>Proſelyte</hi> to the true GOD <hi>behind</hi> her, and ſome <hi>follow'd</hi> her; but <hi>thoſe</hi> were a ſmall <hi>Firſt-fruit,</hi> and as the <hi>Sheaf</hi> in token of the <hi>Harveſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Prophecy</hi> began eminently to be fulfilled in the wonderful Converſions to CHRIST, by the preaching of his <hi>Apoſtles. "The Iſles ſhall wait for me;"</hi> are the Words following my <hi>Text;</hi> the many <hi>Iſles</hi> in the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean</hi> were ſoon viſited, and the remote <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> very ſoon, conſidering its Diſtance, and Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the <hi>Continent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Prophecy is <hi>daily</hi> fulfilling, and at <hi>Times</hi> in a more remarkable Meaſure; but more eſpecially it will be ſo in the <hi>latter</hi> and more happy Days of the Church, when the <hi>Calling of the Jews</hi> and the <hi>Fulneſs of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> ſhall come on.— The LORD haſten the promis'd Day.</p>
            <p>It is the <hi>Power of Godlineſs,</hi> and the <hi>ſaving Converſion</hi> of Souls that is here ſpoken of. The bare outward Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, the <hi>Name and Form</hi> alone, without the Power of Religion, were not <hi>worthy</hi> of this Affection and Joy; <hi>Who are theſe that fly,</hi> &amp;c. We have not ſo <hi>learned</hi> CHRIST, as to ſpeak thus of any thing ſhort of the <hi>ſaving Efficacy</hi> of the preached Goſpel on the Hearts and Lives of Men, "<hi>turning them from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto</hi> GOD. In this <hi>Senſe</hi> let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template and admire the <hi>Event</hi> in my Text, "<hi>Who are theſe that fly as a Cloud,</hi> &amp;c!</p>
            <p>In which Words is repreſented, 1. The <hi>Number and Multitude</hi> of Converts to CHRIST. 2. Their Speed, <hi>Swiftneſs,</hi> Eagerneſs, Earneſtneſs. 3. The <hi>Pleaſure</hi> GOD has in this <hi>Event,</hi> and <hi>Souls</hi> ſhou'd have in it; both Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and People.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:004490_0008_100D586627BB5748"/>
And ſo the <hi>Doctrine</hi> is, That it is a pleaſant and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Thing, to ſee Souls <hi>flocking</hi> and <hi>haſtning to</hi> CHRIST.</p>
            <p>But I will dwell a little more on the <hi>Phraſeology</hi> of the Text, "There ſhou'd be a flying as the <hi>Cloud</hi> before the <hi>Wind:</hi> and as the <hi>Doves</hi> on the <hi>Wing,</hi> to their <hi>Windows.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And 1. Let it be as a <hi>Cloud before the Wind,</hi> a Thing common in theſe <hi>lower Heavens</hi> about us, the <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> wherein we breathe and move: for the Clouds come <hi>down</hi> ſometimes to our very Houſes, and terribly in their <hi>Lightnings</hi> and <hi>peſtilential</hi> Vapours.—But when the Cloud is <hi>light</hi> and flies <hi>high,</hi> we ſee it croſs the Heavens <hi>ſwiftly,</hi> on the Wings of the Wind. — The <hi>Cloud</hi> ſpreads <hi>wide</hi> at Times, overſpreads the Face of the Sky, or a great Part of it, and then may well ſtand for a <hi>Multitude:</hi> A <hi>Cloud,</hi> i. e. a <hi>Croud</hi> of People; as when we read of "<hi>ſo great a Cloud of Witneſſes,</hi> Heb. xii. 2. a <hi>few</hi> of which had been enumerated. So ſpake the Prophet <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel,</hi> Chap. 38. of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> the Enemies of GOD and his <hi>Iſrael; "Thou ſhalt be as a Cloud to cover the Land, thou and all thy Bands and many People with thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, the <hi>Cloud</hi> flies in the <hi>open Heavens,</hi> in the open Sight; and ſo ſhou'd <hi>we</hi> be <hi>open,</hi> in the View of all, confeſſing CHRIST and coming into his Church; with a conſpicuous Zeal, that may appear to Friends and Foes. We may not be <hi>aſham'd</hi> of the Name of CHRIST, nor <hi>cover</hi> our Profeſſion, nor <hi>fear</hi> to expreſs a <hi>Zeal</hi> for his Cauſe, Intereſt and Glory. Let the <hi>timerous Maſter in Iſrael</hi> come <hi>alone to</hi> JESUS <hi>by Night;</hi> but let his <hi>Diſciples</hi> chuſe rather to go in <hi>a Body</hi> and by <hi>Day.</hi> We read of the <hi>riſen Witneſſes of</hi> CHRIST, that they heard a <hi>Voice</hi> from <hi>Heaven,</hi> to them ſaying, "<hi>Come up hither!</hi> and they <hi>aſcended in a Cloud,</hi> and as a Cloud, and their <hi>Enemies beheld them.</hi> In Alluſion to which, all that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the glorious Name of CHRIST ſhou'd make <hi>one Cloud of Witneſſes,</hi> and <hi>aſcend</hi> up after Him, Earth and Hell looking on: Phil. iii. 3. <hi>We are the Circumciſion, that
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004490_0009_100D586807DDA048"/>worſhip</hi> GOD <hi>in the Spirit, and rejoice in</hi> CHRIST JESUS, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Again, the <hi>Cloud flies irreſiſtibly;</hi> no Art or Power of Man can <hi>ſtop</hi> it; ſo our Profeſſion of the Name of CHRIST muſt be <hi>above any Obſtruction,</hi> Let or Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from Earth or Hell. There ſhou'd be a Faith and Love and Zeal, that ſhall carry us <hi>above</hi> Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Difficulties and <hi>Oppoſitions!</hi> an open and <hi>effectual Door</hi> ſhou'd be <hi>open'd,</hi> which <hi>none</hi> ſhou'd be able to <hi>ſhut;</hi> a <hi>Love which many Waters ſhall not quench, nor the Floods drown.</hi> Once more.</p>
            <p>As the Clouds fly <hi>high,</hi> ſo our Hearts and Affections ſhou'd be <hi>rais'd</hi> and <hi>elevated</hi> above the <hi>World</hi> and all <hi>Earthly</hi> Things that <hi>wou'd draw them down.</hi> We muſt be <hi>looking to</hi> JESUS <hi>at the right Hand of</hi> GOD, <hi>and ſet our Affections on Things above;</hi> as <hi>riſen with Him</hi> and aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after him in heavenly Frames and Aſpirations, to be <hi>with him where he is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or, 2. Let the Flight of Souls to CHRIST be <hi>as the Doves to their Windows;</hi> which is the other, and more pleaſant <hi>living,</hi> lively Part in the Compariſon; or what is there among the <hi>winged Fowl</hi> of Heaven, more <hi>beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, clean</hi> and <hi>innocent,</hi> more <hi>meek, loving</hi> and <hi>lovely</hi> than the <hi>Doves!</hi> As the <hi>Deſcent</hi> of the HOLY GHOST on the LAMB OF GOD at his <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is likened to that of the <hi>Dove;</hi> ſo how pleas'd ſhou'd our <hi>Souls</hi> be, to have their <hi>Aſcent to</hi> CHRIST illuſtrated by this Similitude!</p>
            <p>The <hi>Doves haſten</hi> on their Wings, and fly <hi>ſwiftly;</hi> more eſpecially as they return to their <hi>Windows;</hi> with Pleaſure and Joy they <hi>dart</hi> and light there. So let us be <hi>glad</hi> to go to the <hi>Houſe</hi> of the LORD, and there let our <hi>Feet reſt.</hi> Why are we <hi>loth</hi> at any Time to go? why make we no more <hi>haſte</hi> and ſpeed to JESUS CHRIST, to find <hi>Reſt</hi> for our Souls, <hi>Food,</hi> Dwelling, and a Place of <hi>Safety;</hi> a Covering from the <hi>Wind and Tempeſt,</hi> and from the <hi>Powers of the Air</hi> that would devour us; the <hi>Hawk and Vultur?</hi>

How eagerly do the <hi>Doves</hi> fly home at any <hi>Noiſe,</hi> or upon the leaſt fright? ſo will the convinced and awakned terrified <hi>Sinner,</hi> in the great Senſe of his <hi>Danger</hi> by Diſtance from his <hi>Saviour, flee</hi> to Him as his only Shelter, and Place of <hi>Refuge;</hi> he <hi>flies</hi> to Him to <hi>hide</hi> him, even to the <hi>Shadow of his Wings;</hi> for thus has the LORD ſhewn himſelf as with <hi>Wings</hi> unto his <hi>Doves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Awakned Sinners have this <hi>Sight</hi> of CHRIST, as a <hi>prepared,</hi> ready and open Place of <hi>Salvation</hi> for them; and on the <hi>Wings</hi> of earneſt Deſire, Faith and Love, Fear and Prayer, they ſpeed them to their Windows, his <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Ordinances,</hi> or to their <hi>Cloſets,</hi> his <hi>Chambers</hi> and theirs, where he is always preſent to help and ſuccour.</p>

"<hi>Two are better than one,</hi> ſays <hi>Solomon</hi> in the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of GOD; Eccle. iv. 9. <hi>For if they fall one will lift up the other; but Wo to him that is alone; for he hath not another to lift him up.</hi> It's good to travel <hi>ſtrong</hi> towards Heaven.

            <p>More particularly, How pleaſant muſt it be to your pious <hi>Miniſters,</hi> to be inſtrumental and ſucceſsful in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many Souls to CHRIST, and to ſerve in building up his Kingdom on Earth? and how grievous muſt the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint</hi> be from their Hearts and Lips, which yet came from CHRIST's the great Prophet?

            <p>This ſaving Efficacy of the Goſpel is one of the great Joys of Angels, who behold the Face of their and our HEAVENLY FATHER: doubtleſs becauſe they ſee the Pleaſures in the Face of GOD on this Account.

            <p>Finally, The Pleaſure of feeing Souls <hi>flying to</hi> CHRIST riſes to its Height, in the Proſpect it affords of their Meeting together at his right-Hand. This, ſays the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> is <hi>our Hope and Joy and Crown of Rejoicing! even Ye at the Coming of</hi> CHRIST <hi>with all his Saints? for ye are our Glory and Joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Think, Fellow-Chriſtians, how glad you will be to ſee one another then and there! to ſee all Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Sorrow and Danger paſt for ever! to ſee the LORD himſelf glorified and magnified in You together at the great and laſt Day! to ſee your ſelves infinitely bleſſed in Him! let the Thought and Hope hereof rejoice us now in our Fellowſhip together in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>But then 2. A Word on the <hi>Wonder</hi> and <hi>Admiration</hi> that the Thing calls for; "<hi>Souls flying as a Cloud to</hi> CHRIST <hi>and as the Doves to their Windows.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:004490_0017_100D58792CC8F740"/>
               <hi>Who are theſe?</hi> a <hi>ſtrange</hi> and ſurpriſing <hi>Viſion!</hi> a vaſt <hi>Gentile</hi> Church! the MESSIAH King of the many extended Nations! and Abundance of Converſions among People hitherto Strangers to the <hi>true</hi> GOD, and <hi>Aliens from the Covenant of Promiſe! without</hi> GOD <hi>and Hope in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Converſion of any <hi>one</hi> Soul is a Thing to be admired. The <hi>Rarity</hi> of the Thing makes it admirable. What a Pity 'tis to give this as a Reaſon! a true Converſion to GOD is a <hi>ſingular</hi> Thing in a World ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Wickedneſs: Abundance of Converſions then muſt be wonderful.</p>
            <p>Again, The <hi>Difficulty</hi> of the Thing, and the <hi>Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi> made againſt it, both from within and from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, increaſes the Wonder. The natural <hi>Enmity</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us to GOD and Godlineſs; <hi>indwelling Sin,</hi> and an <hi>evil Heart of Unbelief departing from the living</hi> GOD, this makes the <hi>Wonder</hi> in the Converſion of any. But then there are the Powers of Hell, Satan and his Hoſts, in League with Fleſh and Blood, and a World that is <hi>Enmity to</hi> GOD.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Evil One</hi> came and found <hi>nothing in</hi> CHRIST! he comes and finds every evil and filthy Luſt in us: "<hi>but be of good Cheer,</hi> has the HOLY ONE OF GOD ſaid, <hi>I have overcome!</hi>— Saints admire his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and their own Salvation. — "<hi>We wreſtle</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>againſt Fleſh and Blood, Principalities and Powers, the Rulers of the Darkneſs of this World, and ſpiritual Wickedneſſes in high Places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ah Grace and Power to be admired, and celebrated for ever? when JESUS the <hi>Conqueror</hi> ſets the Feet of his victorious <hi>Iſraelites</hi> on the Necks of theſe <hi>Powers of Canaan!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Excellency of the Power is CHRIST's ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Soul it ſelf; in making a <hi>free and willing People,</hi> which is the <hi>Beauty of Holineſs!</hi> For if the SON <hi>make us free we ſhall be free indeed.</hi> We read therefore of a
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004490_0018_100D587B09960678"/>
               <hi>Tranſlation into the glorious Liberty of the Sons of</hi> GOD! What an admirable Word is that! what a ſpiritual Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire is this, the <hi>Kingdom of</hi> GOD <hi>within us!</hi> from a Renovation of the Mind and Heart, a new Creature form'd, not only without any Diſpoſition in Nature thereto, but againſt all poſſible Indiſpoſition Reluctance and Averſation! This is "the Greatneſs of his Power us-ward, who believe! which what Soul can know or comprehend; and therefore ever enough admire the Thing in all its Grandeur! The Change which Grace makes in a Soul, overcoming it to a delightful Conſent to the whole good Pleaſure of GOD. The Surpriſe of this Effect of Grace, was equal to the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> and the <hi>Churches</hi> round about! that by a <hi>Light and Word</hi> on the Way, <hi>He</hi> ſhould be changed at once, from a raging Enemy, into a dutiful Diſciple! "LORD, <hi>What wilt thou have me to do!</hi> that the furious Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor was at once become a zealous Preacher! <hi>and they glorified</hi> GOD <hi>in me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Admirably <hi>free</hi> and ſovereign is this Grace, when, where, how, and by what Means, and to what De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree it will work! ſingling out ſometimes the moſt unworthy, vile, and chief of Sinners! Admirable the <hi>Eaſe</hi> wherewith the Change is effected, by a <hi>Word,</hi> a <hi>Thought,</hi> an <hi>effectual Conviction!</hi> admirably <hi>ſudden and ſilent</hi> when GOD will, as the Heart of <hi>Lydia</hi> was open'd in attending to <hi>Paul.</hi> Or admirable the Force and Roar of the <hi>Earthquake</hi> which ſhook the <hi>Jailor</hi> to pieces! Admirable all the <hi>Variety</hi> of Ways wherein GOD pleaſes to work on one and another!</p>
            <p>Admirable is the whole Work of Grace for the <hi>Excellency</hi> thereof. It is all holy, juſt, and good; glorious in Holineſs, the Work is perfect! So admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Thing was, to ſee a <hi>poor Demoniac</hi> at JESUS <hi>Feet in a right Mind!</hi> but how does the Wonder riſe to ſee abundance of like fooliſh diſtracted Sinners ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, and made wiſe unto Salvation.</p>
            <p>But let us follow the <hi>whole Election of Grace</hi> to the Throne of the MOST HIGH for ever and ever!
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004490_0019_100D587E9E74FF40"/>and what a wondrous Sight will they be! <q>The thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times ten thouſands, and thouſands of thouſands; the Multitudes which no Man can Number, of all Nations and Kindreds and People and Tongues, clothed with white Robes, and Palms in their Hands!</q> The <hi>Inquiry</hi> then will be the ſame as in my <hi>Text</hi> concerning them! <hi>Revel.</hi> vii. 13. <q>Who are theſe? and whence came they? — Theſe that have waſhed their Robes and made them white in the Blood of the LAMB!</q> — which tho' it be primarily the more particular Character of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> of JESUS, yet is really and in Truth the Honour and Glory of every ſincere Convert to Him, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever in Him.</p>
            <p>Having thus finiſh'd on the pleaſing <hi>Admiration</hi> of Souls flying to CHRIST in Clouds and Flocks; let <hi>Us</hi> now <hi>ſhow</hi> in fact that <hi>we</hi> do truly <hi>admire</hi> it, and have <hi>Pleaſure</hi> in it. — Will <hi>we</hi> then be a Part of this lovely, happy, wiſe, holy, <hi>admirable</hi> Number! Are <hi>we</hi> taken up into this <hi>Cloud!</hi> Are <hi>we</hi> on the <hi>Wing</hi> among the <hi>Doves</hi> of CHRIST? Would we not deſire to be of this bleſſed Number and Character.</p>
            <p>Your <hi>Miniſters</hi> would lead you in the Way, and go before you! Come, our <hi>dear People,</hi> and fly with us! Deſcend, O SACRED DOVE! O bleſſed SPIRIT OF GRACE! and raiſe and lift us up, and carry us away, <hi>on high</hi> together.</p>
            <p>There is <hi>none</hi> of us, no not <hi>one,</hi> Miniſters nor People, that can of our ſelves, in our own Strength, <hi>riſe</hi> or <hi>aſcend,</hi> no nor ſo much as <hi>ſtand or go; impotent</hi> as we are and <hi>diſeaſed at the Pool!</hi> there we muſt lie, till the Angel of the LORD come down and ſtir the Waters! Nor can we then put our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in! but JESUS is on the Way, and we ly now in <hi>his</hi> Way, and can look and cry to Him; and at his Word ſhall leap up and run and not be "weary, walk and fly and not faint.</p>

<q>What wilt thou that I ſhould do unto thee? Anſwer, LORD ſave me I periſh! LORD that I may receive my Sight? LORD, that I may be made clean and whole of my Plague!</q>
            </p>
            <p>We have admir'd to ſee how many of you have been of late affected! we ſhall admire more, wonder and be aſham'd and griev'd, if we ſee your Affections <hi>cool</hi> and go off! if <hi>Sabbaths and Ordinances are neglected</hi> as heretofore, or <hi>formally</hi> attended. If you have <q>begun in the Spirit, take heed that it end not in the Fleſh. Confer not with Fleſh and Blood, as bleſſed <hi>Paul</hi> tells

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And now to You, <hi>my Brethren that are in</hi> CHRIST JESUS, who have <hi>choſen the</hi> LORD <hi>to ſerve him,</hi> and have <hi>taken his Yoke</hi> upon you, <hi>eaſy and light</hi> to your Souls; <q>let the Joy of the LORD be your Strength; go on your Way rejoicing! He meeteth him that rejoiceth, and worketh Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, them that remember him in his Ways. Lift up the Hands that hang down, ſtrengthen the feeble Knees. Thank GOD, who has wrought all your Works in you and for you, and ſo far carried you on, kept and recovered you; thank GOD and take Courage. Say, I will never forget thy Precepts, for by them thou haſt quickened me, I will run the Way of thy Commandments as thou enlargeſt my Heart. — The Grace of our LORD JESUS CHRIST be with your Spirits! the Peace of GOD which paſſes all Underſtanding, keep your Hearts and Minds thro' CHRIST JESUS, Unto Him be Glory in the Churches for ever and ever.
