            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>The following REPRESENTATION, on Behalf of the People called QUAKERS,</p>
            <p>SHEWETH,</p>
            <p>THAT the outrages and violences committed on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and on divers of the perſons, of the inhabitants of Philadelphia, of our religious ſociety, by companies of licentious
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:017167_0002_0FA073608B3C5F90"/>people parading the ſtreets, deſtroying the windows and doors of our houſes, breaking into and plundering ſome of them, on the evening of the 24th of laſt month, encreaſes the occaſion of our preſent addreſs to you, who are in the exerciſe of the powers of Civil Government, which is in itſelf honorable, and originally inſtituted for the ſupport of public peace and good order, and the preſervation of the juſt rights of the people.</p>
            <p>Although we believe that moſt of you are not unacquainted with our religious principles in general, and the reaſons of our diſſent from other profeſſed Chriſtians, in divers matters relating to faith and practice, yet as ſuch riotous proceedings are ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Chriſtian name, and diſhonorable to government, and many of us have ſuffered great loſs and damage, we apprehend it our duty to bring into your view the grounds of our not comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the vain modes of rejoicing, in which many indulge themſelves, as alſo for the information of others, who through miſapprehenſion or prejudice too freely attribute our conduct to obſtinacy and a party-ſpirit, and are thus prompted wrongfully to judge and condemn us.</p>
            <p>It therefore appears to us requiſite to put you and them in mind, that at the beginning of the Reformation, a few centuries paſt, the day of the Lord gradually broke forth in divers nations of Europe, raiſing up pious men to declare againſt the groſs ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions and impoſitions, contrary to the nature and ſpirit of chriſtianity, which for many ages had prevailed, and enabling them to ſtand faithful, many of them even unto death, according to the diſcoveries of duty made known to them, in that revival of Goſpel dawn on their minds. And in proceſs of time it pleaſed Almighty God further to cauſe his glorious day of light to advance, and the ſun of righteouſneſs to ſhine in great bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whereby not only the groſs, but alſo the more ſpecious, as

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> branches of corruption, were manifeſted to our worthy anceſtors, which divine principle of light and truth we alſo <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>In <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> manifeſtation of goſpel light they clearly ſaw, and many of us are now alſo firmly convinced, among other important truths, that the luſts of ambition, avarice, envy, and emulation, from whence wars, ſtrife and contention about earthly things, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, are the fruits of the depravity and corruption of the human heart, which muſt be expelled and eradicated in the ſpiritual work of Chriſtian redemption; and they not only ſaw that they muſt ceaſe from outward hoſtilities, but that their converſation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct muſt be conſiſtent with the doctrine and precepts of the goſpel. That as they could not join with others in ſhedding the blood of their fellow-men, for whom Chriſt died, "and who came to ſave men's lives, and not to deſtroy them;" neither could they unite in rejoicing for the advantages gained by ſuch bloodſhed. As they could not fight with the fighters, neither could they triumph with the conquerors; and therefore they were not to be prevailed upon to make a ſhew of conformity in ſuch rejoicings, by placing lights in any part of the fronts of their houſes, or other compliances of the like nature and tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; well knowing the levity and folly attending ſuch things to be inconſiſtent with religious gravity and ſobriety, and with that godly fear and reverence, which ought at all times to dwell on the minds of thoſe who profeſs to be followers of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>It was likewiſe ſhewed to them, in the ſame divine light, as well as by the doctrine of the holy ſcriptures, that the ſons of God were led by the ſpirit of God, and that all voluntary humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and will-worſhip muſt be laid aſide by them, and therefore they could not ſubject themſelves in the worſhip of Almighty
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:017167_0004_0FA073620AC9B418"/>God to the will and commands of men; and as they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from inſincerity, they could not diſſemble by ſeeming to conform, when in heart and ſpirit they did not; and therefore continued to open their ſhops, and follow their lawful occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, on days appointed by human authority for the obſervation of public <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, feaſts, and thankſgivings, as uſual on other days. This was their conſtant conſcientious practice, that they might ſtand clear in the diſcharge of their duty towards God, and with intent that others, through their example, might be induced to reflect upon the vanity and impropriety of thoſe obſervances and tumults, and their incoherence with the inward life, ſpirit and virtue, of true religion, and Chriſtian ſobriety.</p>
            <p>And notwithſtanding they were charged with being actuated by a ſpirit of ſingularity, obſtinacy, and a deſire to be contrary to others, yet they demonſtrated that in whatſoever they could comply, agreeable to good conſcience, they were ready to do it. Thus they concurred with the propriety and decency of other profeſſed Chriſtians, in appropriating the firſt day of the week for the performance of public worſhip, believing it alſo to be their duty to ſuſpend their attention to their outward concerns on other days, and to meet often together, according to the practice of the primitive Chriſtians, for the like pious purpoſe.</p>
            <p>It is not from imitation, or for the ſupport of ancient cuſtom, but from a conviction of judgment, that we are led into the ſame practice with our anceſtors; being firmly perſuaded that the holy ſpirit will, in like manner, lead and guide ſuch who are faithful to its dictates, in their conduct and converſation among men, and eſpecially in matters of faith and worſhip; and therefore we can neither really worſhip, nor put on any part of the appearance thereof, meerly in conformity to the injunctions of human autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; believing it our duty rather to ſhew our neighbours by our
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:017167_0005_0FA07362CB119A58"/>practice, that in this goſpel day the holy ſpirit hath led us out of the formality of public faſts, which though, in practice under the Jewiſh diſpenſation, it does not appear that they are enjoined on Chriſtians, either by precept or example, from the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Chriſt himſelf in his ſpiritual appearance being the teacher of his people, and when he leads them to faſt, he directs that it be in private, <note place="margin">Mat. vi. 16, 17 and 18.</note> and that they appear not unto men to faſt. This we believe to be our duty as a people to bear conſtant and open teſtimony unto, and alſo to maintain it fully, and not in part only, leſt by falling ſhort therein, we ſhould deny Chriſt our Lord before men, whom we ought to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge before all, and who hath ſaid, "whoſoever ſhall deny me before men, him will I alſo deny before my Father which is in heaven."</p>
            <p>Our forefathers, under full conviction of the rectitude of their principles, and uprightneſs of their intentions, of which they had given indubitable proofs, through a long ſeries of ſevere perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in their native land, borne with much firmneſs and Chriſtian patience, became at length intruſted with, and intitled to, many valuable extenſive rights and privileges; which induced them, at their own expence, to encounter the dangers of the ſeas, and many other hazards and difficulties, to ſettle and improve this country, at that time a wilderneſs; having firſt, in concert with their much beloved friend, the wife William Penn, formed ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of government as gave the moſt promiſing proſpect of ſecuring to themſelves, and their poſterity, the free and full en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of liberty of conſcience, which they preferred to all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral conſiderations, and were conſtantly careful to preſerve not only to themſelves, but to all perſons of every other religious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, who dwelt among them, and for a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of years the adminiſtration of the laws was chiefly committed
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:017167_0006_0FA073638C608C70"/>to men of the ſame liberal principles; that by the divine bleſſing on their pious concern for the preſent and future proſperity and happineſs of the people, piety and virtue were promoted and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, vice and irreligion were diſcountenanced, peace, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and concord prevailed, and the enjoyment of religious and civil liberty was inviolably preſerved. Thus Pennſylvania be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came celebrated for the mildneſs and liberal temper of its go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and great numbers of ſober perſons of tender conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of different religious profeſſions, found a quiet retreat from the oppreſſion and perſecution to which they had been ſubjected in various parts of Europe.</p>
            <p>It muſt therefore appear ſtrange and extraordinary, in the view of candid enquirers, that ſo evident a change and contraſt have taken place, and that we, many of whom are the deſcendants of the firſt ſettlers, profeſſing the ſame religious principles, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected in intereſt, affection and duty, to the real good and welfare of our country, who have never forfeited our birthright, ſhould now be vilified, perſecuted, impriſoned, and excluded from our juſt liberties and privileges, not only by laws which have been calculated to oppreſs us, and the execution of them in ſome places committed to men of avaricious, profligate principles, who have made a prey of the innocent and induſtrious, to the great loſs and damage of ſome, and the almoſt ruin of others; but ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous publications, and other invidious means uſed by our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries to calumniate and reproach us with opprobrious names, in order to inflame the minds of the ignorant, and impoſe on the credulous, to our prejudice; when, upon an impartial candid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, we truſt it will appear, that in the courſe of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions which have unhappily prevailed, no juſt cauſe of offence will be found againſt us in the general, but that we have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to maintain our peaceable religious principles, to preſerve
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:017167_0007_0FA07364510DF780"/>a good conſcience towards God, and to manifeſt our good will to all men.</p>
            <p>We are not incited by party views, or vindictive motives, in this repreſentation, but to awaken your cool and diſpaſſionate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to our multiplied ſufferings and the abuſes we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; knowing that magiſtracy is intended for a terror to evil doers, and an encouragement to the virtuous; but where the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary care and exertions are not uſed, for the prevention and ſuppreſſion of prophanity, tumults and outrage, and a virtuous part of the community are oppreſſed and inſulted, the true end of government is neglected, and anarchy, confuſion, contempt of authority, and inſecurity to perſons and property, will ſucceed; and although public faſts may be proclaimed, and days under the name of humiliation recommended and appointed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſin and tranſgreſſion verbally made, yet, unleſs there be a true and ſincere faſting from ambition, ſtrife, ill-will, animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, infidelity, fraud, luxury, revelling, drunkenneſs, oppreſſion, and all manner of evil, it cannot be a faſt or acceptable day to the Lord; nor can we have a well grounded hope, that the ſcourge with which the inhabitants have been viſited will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and days of peace and tranquility reſtored.</p>
            <p>The diſpenſation of war, bloodſhed and calamity, which hath been permitted to prevail on this continent, is very ſolemn and awful, demanding the moſt ſerious and heart-felt attention of all ranks and denominations among the people, individually to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and examine how far we are each of us really and ſincerely engaged to bring forth fruits of true repentance, and amendment of life, agreeable to the ſpirit and doctrine of the goſpel. And although we have been expoſed to great abuſe and unchriſtian treatment, we wiſh to be enabled, through the aſſiſtance of divine grace, to cheriſh in ourſelves, and inculcate in others with whom
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:017167_0008_0FA0736532764A08"/>we have an influence, that diſpoſition of forgiveneſs of injuries enjoined by the precepts and example of Chriſt, our holy Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver; and to manifeſt our deſires and endeavours to promote the real good of our country, and that we are</p>
