            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>The following REPRESENTATION, on Behalf of the People called QUAKERS,</p>
            <p>SHEWETH,</p>
            <p>THAT the outrages and violences committed on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and on divers of the perÅ¿ons, of the inhabitants of Philadelphia, of our religious Å¿ociety, by companies of licentious
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:017167_0002_0FA073608B3C5F90"/>people parading the Å¿treets, deÅ¿troying the windows and doors of our houÅ¿es, breaking into and plundering Å¿ome of them, on the evening of the 24th of laÅ¿t month, encreaÅ¿es the occaÅ¿ion of our preÅ¿ent addreÅ¿s to you, who are in the exerciÅ¿e of the powers of Civil Government, which is in itÅ¿elf honorable, and originally inÅ¿tituted for the Å¿upport of public peace and good order, and the preÅ¿ervation of the juÅ¿t rights of the people.</p>
            <p>Although we believe that moÅ¿t of you are not unacquainted with our religious principles in general, and the reaÅ¿ons of our diÅ¿Å¿ent from other profeÅ¿Å¿ed ChriÅ¿tians, in divers matters relating to faith and practice, yet as Å¿uch riotous proceedings are Å¿hame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the ChriÅ¿tian name, and diÅ¿honorable to government, and many of us have Å¿uffered great loÅ¿s and damage, we apprehend it our duty to bring into your view the grounds of our not comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the vain modes of rejoicing, in which many indulge themÅ¿elves, as alÅ¿o for the information of others, who through miÅ¿apprehenÅ¿ion or prejudice too freely attribute our conduct to obÅ¿tinacy and a party-Å¿pirit, and are thus prompted wrongfully to judge and condemn us.</p>
            <p>It therefore appears to us requiÅ¿ite to put you and them in mind, that at the beginning of the Reformation, a few centuries paÅ¿t, the day of the Lord gradually broke forth in divers nations of Europe, raiÅ¿ing up pious men to declare againÅ¿t the groÅ¿s Å¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perÅ¿titions and impoÅ¿itions, contrary to the nature and Å¿pirit of chriÅ¿tianity, which for many ages had prevailed, and enabling them to Å¿tand faithful, many of them even unto death, according to the diÅ¿coveries of duty made known to them, in that revival of GoÅ¿pel dawn on their minds. And in proceÅ¿s of time it pleaÅ¿ed Almighty God further to cauÅ¿e his glorious day of light to advance, and the Å¿un of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s to Å¿hine in great bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s, whereby not only the groÅ¿s, but alÅ¿o the more Å¿pecious, as

                  <desc>ãâ¦ã</desc>
               </gap> branches of corruption, were manifeÅ¿ted to our worthy anceÅ¿tors, which divine principle of light and truth we alÅ¿o <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>ãâã</desc>
               </gap> manifeÅ¿tation of goÅ¿pel light they clearly Å¿aw, and many of us are now alÅ¿o firmly convinced, among other important truths, that the luÅ¿ts of ambition, avarice, envy, and emulation, from whence wars, Å¿trife and contention about earthly things, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, are the fruits of the depravity and corruption of the human heart, which muÅ¿t be expelled and eradicated in the Å¿piritual work of ChriÅ¿tian redemption; and they not only Å¿aw that they muÅ¿t ceaÅ¿e from outward hoÅ¿tilities, but that their converÅ¿ation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct muÅ¿t be conÅ¿iÅ¿tent with the doctrine and precepts of the goÅ¿pel. That as they could not join with others in Å¿hedding the blood of their fellow-men, for whom ChriÅ¿t died, "and who came to Å¿ave men's lives, and not to deÅ¿troy them;" neither could they unite in rejoicing for the advantages gained by Å¿uch bloodÅ¿hed. As they could not fight with the fighters, neither could they triumph with the conquerors; and therefore they were not to be prevailed upon to make a Å¿hew of conformity in Å¿uch rejoicings, by placing lights in any part of the fronts of their houÅ¿es, or other compliances of the like nature and tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; well knowing the levity and folly attending Å¿uch things to be inconÅ¿iÅ¿tent with religious gravity and Å¿obriety, and with that godly fear and reverence, which ought at all times to dwell on the minds of thoÅ¿e who profeÅ¿s to be followers of the Lord JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t.</p>
            <p>It was likewiÅ¿e Å¿hewed to them, in the Å¿ame divine light, as well as by the doctrine of the holy Å¿criptures, that the Å¿ons of God were led by the Å¿pirit of God, and that all voluntary humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and will-worÅ¿hip muÅ¿t be laid aÅ¿ide by them, and therefore they could not Å¿ubject themÅ¿elves in the worÅ¿hip of Almighty
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:017167_0004_0FA073620AC9B418"/>God to the will and commands of men; and as they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from inÅ¿incerity, they could not diÅ¿Å¿emble by Å¿eeming to conform, when in heart and Å¿pirit they did not; and therefore continued to open their Å¿hops, and follow their lawful occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, on days appointed by human authority for the obÅ¿ervation of public <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ãâã</desc>
               </gap>, feaÅ¿ts, and thankÅ¿givings, as uÅ¿ual on other days. This was their conÅ¿tant conÅ¿cientious practice, that they might Å¿tand clear in the diÅ¿charge of their duty towards God, and with intent that others, through their example, might be induced to reflect upon the vanity and impropriety of thoÅ¿e obÅ¿ervances and tumults, and their incoherence with the inward life, Å¿pirit and virtue, of true religion, and ChriÅ¿tian Å¿obriety.</p>
            <p>And notwithÅ¿tanding they were charged with being actuated by a Å¿pirit of Å¿ingularity, obÅ¿tinacy, and a deÅ¿ire to be contrary to others, yet they demonÅ¿trated that in whatÅ¿oever they could comply, agreeable to good conÅ¿cience, they were ready to do it. Thus they concurred with the propriety and decency of other profeÅ¿Å¿ed ChriÅ¿tians, in appropriating the firÅ¿t day of the week for the performance of public worÅ¿hip, believing it alÅ¿o to be their duty to Å¿uÅ¿pend their attention to their outward concerns on other days, and to meet often together, according to the practice of the primitive ChriÅ¿tians, for the like pious purpoÅ¿e.</p>
            <p>It is not from imitation, or for the Å¿upport of ancient cuÅ¿tom, but from a conviction of judgment, that we are led into the Å¿ame practice with our anceÅ¿tors; being firmly perÅ¿uaded that the holy Å¿pirit will, in like manner, lead and guide Å¿uch who are faithful to its dictates, in their conduct and converÅ¿ation among men, and eÅ¿pecially in matters of faith and worÅ¿hip; and therefore we can neither really worÅ¿hip, nor put on any part of the appearance thereof, meerly in conformity to the injunctions of human autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; believing it our duty rather to Å¿hew our neighbours by our
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:017167_0005_0FA07362CB119A58"/>practice, that in this goÅ¿pel day the holy Å¿pirit hath led us out of the formality of public faÅ¿ts, which though, in practice under the JewiÅ¿h diÅ¿penÅ¿ation, it does not appear that they are enjoined on ChriÅ¿tians, either by precept or example, from the New TeÅ¿ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf in his Å¿piritual appearance being the teacher of his people, and when he leads them to faÅ¿t, he directs that it be in private, <note place="margin">Mat. vi. 16, 17 and 18.</note> and that they appear not unto men to faÅ¿t. This we believe to be our duty as a people to bear conÅ¿tant and open teÅ¿timony unto, and alÅ¿o to maintain it fully, and not in part only, leÅ¿t by falling Å¿hort therein, we Å¿hould deny ChriÅ¿t our Lord before men, whom we ought to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge before all, and who hath Å¿aid, "whoÅ¿oever Å¿hall deny me before men, him will I alÅ¿o deny before my Father which is in heaven."</p>
            <p>Our forefathers, under full conviction of the rectitude of their principles, and uprightneÅ¿s of their intentions, of which they had given indubitable proofs, through a long Å¿eries of Å¿evere perÅ¿ecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in their native land, borne with much firmneÅ¿s and ChriÅ¿tian patience, became at length intruÅ¿ted with, and intitled to, many valuable extenÅ¿ive rights and privileges; which induced them, at their own expence, to encounter the dangers of the Å¿eas, and many other hazards and difficulties, to Å¿ettle and improve this country, at that time a wilderneÅ¿s; having firÅ¿t, in concert with their much beloved friend, the wife William Penn, formed Å¿uch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿titution of government as gave the moÅ¿t promiÅ¿ing proÅ¿pect of Å¿ecuring to themÅ¿elves, and their poÅ¿terity, the free and full en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of liberty of conÅ¿cience, which they preferred to all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral conÅ¿iderations, and were conÅ¿tantly careful to preÅ¿erve not only to themÅ¿elves, but to all perÅ¿ons of every other religious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, who dwelt among them, and for a conÅ¿iderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of years the adminiÅ¿tration of the laws was chiefly committed
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:017167_0006_0FA073638C608C70"/>to men of the Å¿ame liberal principles; that by the divine bleÅ¿Å¿ing on their pious concern for the preÅ¿ent and future proÅ¿perity and happineÅ¿s of the people, piety and virtue were promoted and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, vice and irreligion were diÅ¿countenanced, peace, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and concord prevailed, and the enjoyment of religious and civil liberty was inviolably preÅ¿erved. Thus PennÅ¿ylvania be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came celebrated for the mildneÅ¿s and liberal temper of its go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and great numbers of Å¿ober perÅ¿ons of tender conÅ¿cien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of different religious profeÅ¿Å¿ions, found a quiet retreat from the oppreÅ¿Å¿ion and perÅ¿ecution to which they had been Å¿ubjected in various parts of Europe.</p>
            <p>It muÅ¿t therefore appear Å¿trange and extraordinary, in the view of candid enquirers, that Å¿o evident a change and contraÅ¿t have taken place, and that we, many of whom are the deÅ¿cendants of the firÅ¿t Å¿ettlers, profeÅ¿Å¿ing the Å¿ame religious principles, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected in intereÅ¿t, affection and duty, to the real good and welfare of our country, who have never forfeited our birthright, Å¿hould now be vilified, perÅ¿ecuted, impriÅ¿oned, and excluded from our juÅ¿t liberties and privileges, not only by laws which have been calculated to oppreÅ¿s us, and the execution of them in Å¿ome places committed to men of avaricious, profligate principles, who have made a prey of the innocent and induÅ¿trious, to the great loÅ¿s and damage of Å¿ome, and the almoÅ¿t ruin of others; but Å¿cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous publications, and other invidious means uÅ¿ed by our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿aries to calumniate and reproach us with opprobrious names, in order to inflame the minds of the ignorant, and impoÅ¿e on the credulous, to our prejudice; when, upon an impartial candid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, we truÅ¿t it will appear, that in the courÅ¿e of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions which have unhappily prevailed, no juÅ¿t cauÅ¿e of offence will be found againÅ¿t us in the general, but that we have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to maintain our peaceable religious principles, to preÅ¿erve

            <p>We are not incited by party views, or vindictive motives, in this repreÅ¿entation, but to awaken your cool and diÅ¿paÅ¿Å¿ionate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to our multiplied Å¿ufferings and the abuÅ¿es we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; knowing that magiÅ¿tracy is intended for a terror to evil doers, and an encouragement to the virtuous; but where the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ary care and exertions are not uÅ¿ed, for the prevention and Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿ion of prophanity, tumults and outrage, and a virtuous part of the community are oppreÅ¿Å¿ed and inÅ¿ulted, the true end of government is neglected, and anarchy, confuÅ¿ion, contempt of authority, and inÅ¿ecurity to perÅ¿ons and property, will Å¿ucceed; and although public faÅ¿ts may be proclaimed, and days under the name of humiliation recommended and appointed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿in and tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ion verbally made, yet, unleÅ¿s there be a true and Å¿incere faÅ¿ting from ambition, Å¿trife, ill-will, animoÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, infidelity, fraud, luxury, revelling, drunkenneÅ¿s, oppreÅ¿Å¿ion, and all manner of evil, it cannot be a faÅ¿t or acceptable day to the Lord; nor can we have a well grounded hope, that the Å¿courge with which the inhabitants have been viÅ¿ited will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and days of peace and tranquility reÅ¿tored.</p>
            <p>The diÅ¿penÅ¿ation of war, bloodÅ¿hed and calamity, which hath been permitted to prevail on this continent, is very Å¿olemn and awful, demanding the moÅ¿t Å¿erious and heart-felt attention of all ranks and denominations among the people, individually to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ider and examine how far we are each of us really and Å¿incerely engaged to bring forth fruits of true repentance, and amendment of life, agreeable to the Å¿pirit and doctrine of the goÅ¿pel.
