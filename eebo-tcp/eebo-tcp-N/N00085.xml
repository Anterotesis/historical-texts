            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THe time when this Prophesie was given forth by <hi>Zechariah</hi> at the commandment of God, you may see in the first Verse of this Chapter; it was <hi>in the eighth Moneth, in the second year of Darius.</hi> In the time of the reign of <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> the work of building the Temple was hindred, untill the second year of <hi>Darius</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> Ezra 4.24. But <hi>Darius,</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his reign, finding in the Records <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Decree for the building of the Temple at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> strictly commanded that Work should proceed, and that none should hinder the <hi>Jews</hi> therein; and that their Enemies should assist them, and give them all necessary expences out of the Kings Tribute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the River, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> under a dreadful penalty, as may be seen
<pb facs="unknown:000137_0003_0FA2616C75A26860"/>
in the sixth Chapter of <hi>Ezra.</hi> The event was, that <hi>the Elders of the Jews builded, and prospered</hi> therein <hi>through the prophesy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of</hi> the Prophets <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Zechariah,</hi> Ezra 6.14. and the Work was finished in the sixth year of <hi>Darius,</hi> Ver. 15.</p>
            <p>The unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> in Christs time said, <hi>Fourty and six years was this Temple in building, and wilt thou rear it in three dayes?</hi> Joh. 2.20. For <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> surnamed <hi>Long-hand,</hi> reigned fourty, or one and fourty years; in the beginning of his reign the Work ceased, by his Decree against it, till the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond year of <hi>Darius,</hi> who succeeded him, and it was finished in the sixth year of his reign. Christ spake of the Temple of his Body, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.21. and therefore their discourse of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall Temple at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> was impertinent. Yet from the History of those times, two things may be noted:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That God sometimes suffers the Enemies of true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to prevail, for the hinderance of the building of Gods House for a long time.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That in such Times God discovereth in his own people a sinful remisness to neglect the publick service of God, and to be too intent upon their own private concernments, and to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie themselves with such a pretence as this, We cannot help it, the Adversaries are many and potent, and the King of <hi>Persia</hi> is against the Work; therefore we will leave the publick work till better times, and will minde our own houses and domesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call affairs. But God was displeased with them, and shewed it by smiting them in their private advantages by the Fruits of the Earth, for their disregard of his publick Worship, as the Lord told them by <hi>Haggai,</hi> Hagg. 1.4 — 12. and in two moneths after he sent <hi>Zechariah</hi> to encourage them to go on strenuously in the work of the Lord, that had been so long neglected by their fault.</p>
            <p>In the second Verse of this Chapter he told them that God had been <hi>sore disppleased with their fathers</hi>; and in the 4, 5, and 6th Verses, he tells them for what God was displeased with their fathers; and from thence infers the Exhortation in my Text, as the illative particle (<hi>Therefore</hi>) shews.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:000137_0004_0FA2616DA8754108"/>In the words we may note,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Command</hi> of God to this Prophet, <hi>Say unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Message</hi> which he must deliver to them, consisting for the Matter of it, of three parts: 1. A Precept, <hi>Turn unto me.</hi> 2. A Promise, <hi>And I will turn unto you.</hi> 3. A Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, or Confirmation of both, yet applied to each seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, <hi>Saith the Lord of Hosts.</hi> For Exposition of the words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Turn unto me</hi>] Renounce all Idols and mens Devices in my Worship; acknowledge me alone to be your God, and my Word to be your onely Rule, with unfeigned Repentance for your former departures from me, and disobedience to my Word; be my people, and observe my Commandments: for, to cry to God for Corn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not a turning to God, but to the Creature, <hi>Hos.</hi> 7.14. but it is to seek God for himself, when nothing will satisfie us besides God himself to be our God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 144.15. and when we mourn, not so much for the loss, or want of these things, as for Gods displeasure for our sins that have incensed his wrath, and so seek Gods face, &amp; reconciliation with him in Christ, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4.6, 7. God doth not require this of them, as if it were in their power to do it, but to convince them that it is their duty, whereunto he would excite them by the Ministry of his Prophet, and would quicken and inable them by the efficacy of his Spirit accompanying the same.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And I will turn unto you</hi>] Gods turning to us is not like our turning to God: for, our turning to God supposeth a change in us, but Gods turning to us is <hi>without shadow of turning,</hi> Jam. 1.17. both in his Nature, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.6. and in his Will, <hi>Isa.</hi> 46.10. but it is to be understood in respect of his Effects; that is to say, I will be reconciled to you, and shew it by sutable effects, as <hi>Micah</hi> 7.19. <hi>He will turn again, he will have compassion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saith the Lord of Hosts</hi>] This Attribute shews his Absolute dominion over all Creatures in Heaven and Earth, whom he can dispose of by his command, to execute his vengeance upon those that disobey him: in this sense it is added to the Precept. And to be Instruments of dispensing the effects of his favour to
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000137_0005_0FA2616DF9276C88"/>
those that turn unto him, and obey him; in this sense it is added to the Promise: In both it is suited with their condition, who had experience of the former, and upon their returning to him should finde him ready to use his Hosts for their good.</p>
            <p>First, from the <hi>Message</hi> which God commands the Prophet to deliver to them, as the Means whereby God would bring the Jews to turn unto himself, that it might be well with them, the Ministry of his Prophets, <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Zechariah,</hi> note:
<q>
                  <hi>Doct. I.</hi> Gods usuall way which he will bless for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting or turning of elect sinners to himself, is by sending his Ministers with a Message from himself to them, in their Preaching Gods Word unto them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From these words, <hi>Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord of Hosts.</hi> I grant, God is able, by his Absolute Power, to convert whom he will, and by what means he will; and that God hath in extraordinary times and cases converted some to himself without these means: thus he wrought saith in <hi>Rahab,</hi> Heb. 11.31. yet ordinarily he will do it only by these means, where they may be had. This may be cleared from Scripture in a twofold Conversion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. From the state of sin to the state of grace, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. 2. From evil in their practice, so <hi>David</hi>: this holds in all the degrees of Conversion to God. 1. Hereby he is wont to convince men effectually of sin, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.9. and to a saving sense of it, and remorse for it. See this in <hi>David,</hi> to whom he sent <hi>Nathan,</hi> 2 Sam. 12. and afterwards <hi>Gad,</hi> in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.10. <hi>his heart smote him</hi>; how came that to pass? see <hi>Ver.</hi> 11, 12, 13. And, though it is said of <hi>Manasseh,</hi> 2 Chron. 33.12, 13. that <hi>when he was in affliction he besought the Lord his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his father, and prayed unto him, and he was intreated of him</hi>; yet the affliction of it self did not turn him to God, but the principal means of his repentance, and turning to God, were <hi>the words of the Se<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> that spake to him in the name of the Lord God of Israel,</hi> as it appeareth in <hi>Ver.</hi> 18. So <hi>Peters</hi> Ministry, in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. Hence the Word of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000137_0006_0FA2616EA550A0A8"/>
God is likened to <hi>fire,</hi> and to a <hi>hammer,</hi> Jer. 23.29. in its efficacy. 2. Hereby God is wont to bring men to Christ, and to work faith in their hearts, unto their reconciliation with God by him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14, 15. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18, 19. The Ministry is committed to men, but the Efficacy is from Gods Spirit, <hi>Isa.</hi> 57.19. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44, 45. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because the Lord will thus honour his own Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. He could have converted the Eunuch immediately by his Spirit, yet he sent <hi>Philip</hi> to him, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.29. Yea, when himself hath begun the work, yet he hath sent Ministers to them, that the work might be effected by them; as <hi>Ananias</hi> to <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 9.11. <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> Acts 10. and he ascribes to them as his Instruments, that which is his own work, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Because the Lord will thus honour the freeness and power of his grace, in working more effectually by weaker means. The whole Scripture is breathed of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore infallible, and stamped with Gods own Authority in every sentence of it, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. and the Preaching of man is weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in it self, and more liable to be slighted by proud men, <hi>Jer.</hi> 43.2. yet God puts forth his efficacy more in the Word preached, then in the Word read, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. for <hi>his strength is made perfect in weakness,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.9. and therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle notes this as Gods end in this dispensation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. Because thus the Lord will make known the efficacy of his Spirit in and with the Word preached, that the glory of turning elect sinners to himself, may be ascribed wholly to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: hence the Ministry of the Word is called <hi>the ministration of the Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.8. because the Spirit accompanieth that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance; therefore they that disobeyed the word spoken by the former Prophets, are said to harden themselves against <hi>the words which the Lord of Hosts sent in his Spirit</hi> by them; <hi>therefore there came a great wrath from the Lord of Hosts,</hi> Zech. 7.12. So <hi>Steven</hi>'s hearers are said to <hi>resist the holy Ghost,</hi> Act. 7.51. Hence the Apostle ascribes the conversion of men by the Ministry of the Gospel, onely to God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 3.5, 6, 7. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5. and the Heathen man converted confessed it,

               <hi>Vse</hi> 1. <hi>for Instruction:</hi> 1. That it is no easie thing for sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to turn unto God. 1. You see great and long-continued afflictions, of themselves, cannot convert men: so the Text. The building of the Temple had been hindred above fourty years, which they should have been affected with, as an effect of Gods displeasure for some sins yet remaining among them, and they should have been provoked thereby to turn unto God: but on the contrary, they turned their thoughts to minde the building of their own houses. Then the Lord was further dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased, and afflicted them with scarcity of food, by Drought and Dearth; yet they were dedolent and stupid, till the Lord sent the Prophet <hi>Haggai,</hi> to call them to consider their wayes, and to shew them for what cause this Judgement was upon them, and to stir them up to remove the Cause, that the Effect might cease. 2. The multitude and variety of afflictions one following another successively, cannot of themselves turn sinners to God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.22. This we may see in <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who though under the stroke of punishment he sometimes confessed his sin, and promised amendment, yet after ten plagues, remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as hard-hearted as at first: And in <hi>Ahaz,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.22. and in the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> Amos 4.6 —12. 3. Nor can outward Mercies of themselves work this, <hi>Isa.</hi> 26.10. 4. Nor can awakings of Conscience by the shameful and dreadful Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of sin, of themselves work this. This made <hi>Adam</hi> fly to hide himself, when he heard Gods voice walking in the garden, <hi>Genes.</hi> 3.15. Nor can the outward Ministry of the Gospel, though accompanied with Miracles, of themselves work this: this we see in Christs hearers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.20, <hi>to</hi> 25. unless the Spirit by his divine Efficacy turn men to God, it cannot be done. See <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. See from whence this comes: 1. From the many Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000137_0008_0FA261701E538CC0"/>
and Helps that sin hath to keep its possession and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion in mens hearts, as, 1. The rooted Enmity against God in the Nature of man, <hi>Coloss.</hi> 1.21. and Custome addes strength thereto, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.23. and hereunto the <hi>course of the world, and the working of Satan,</hi> Eph. 2.2, 3. and to these Gods desertion, <hi>Psal.</hi> 81.11, 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but above all, the love of sin in the members, which works against the law of the minde, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptivates even those that have a principle of grace in them. <hi>Paul</hi> complained of this, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. <hi>I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my minde,</hi> &amp;c. A <hi>Law</hi> there signifies, a strong compelling inclination, which forceth to its obedience, as it were by authority, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14. 2. It is called <hi>the law of the members,</hi> because it inclines not by reason, but by naturall force, as the members of the body are moved and acted by the will. 3. It is said to <hi>war against the law of the minde,</hi> to shew that there is a strong faction of lusts against grace: the members are many, so are these lusts, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain to evil, and restrain from good.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Learn therefore to proportion your endeavours to the difficulty of the work. It is an evident proof that they are yet unconverted, who think its an easie thing to turn unto God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.12. What then is to be done? 1. In sense of your own inability, cry mightily unto God day and night, and leave not praying for it till the thing be attained, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18. <hi>Lam.</hi> 5.24. <hi>Ephraim</hi> and the ten Tribes finding that Afflictions could not do it, pray to God to turn them: And the two Tribes found that their Captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> of it self, could not do it, therefore they cry unto God that he would do it. 2. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain unto God of the Impediments of it in your selves, and pray him to remove them, <hi>Isa.</hi> 63.17. 3. Look unto Christ for efficacy to be put forth upon you, in and by the Ministry of the Gospel. Though the Disciples could not cast out the Devil out of the Childe, yet Christ could and did: therefore the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of him took a right course, when he brought his son that was possessed with a Devil unto Christ, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.17, <hi>to</hi> 30. When lusts are too strong for a man, Christ comes as a Prince
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000137_0009_0FA26170DD5B6568"/>
and overcomes them, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31. Do not rest in your own resolutions, but go to God in Christ for strength, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.16, 20. where the mighty power that works in us, is the power of Christs Death and Resurrection: Believe in him, and thou shalt overcome. 4. Improve all the wayes which God useth for this end, that the purpose of God in them may be effected; to wit, (1.) Attend his Word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in Precepts, Promises, Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and the impressions of them in thy heart at any time. (2.) His Providences, in some great cross upon the commission of a sin; some dangerous sickness, though not unto death; some inward terrours of Conscience upon sin committed; some evil report, or some judgement executed in our sight upon another, for like sin to yours, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 2. For <hi>Reproof</hi> of two sorts of people: 1. Of such as for worldly Accommodation, live in places where they have not the Word powerfully preached to them. Remember <hi>Lot.</hi> 2. Of such as live under such means, but are unprofitable and disobedient hearers. Two things I have to say unto such.</p>
            <p n="1">1. No course that God ordinarily takes with men will cause you to turn unto God, if this doth not, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.31. therefore do not look at this (That you are not the better toward God after you have lived long under the Ministry of the Word) as a small evil; for it is great in Gods account, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.8. If you be not the better, you are the worser by it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Marvel not if God frustrate your Expectations in the fruits of the Earth, when you frustrate his in the fruits of the Word, <hi>Isa.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Luke</hi> 13.6, 7. for God hath threatned this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment against those that disobey his Word, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.14, 21, 23, 27. and a worse famine then that of Bread, even of the Word, in <hi>Amos</hi> 8.11, 12.</p>
            <p>Secondly, From the <hi>Message</hi> it self: Hence sundry Doctrines may be observed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From Gods suspending of his promise of turning to sinners, till their turning to him;
<q>That it is in vain for any to expect Gods turning to them, that do not turn to him.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:000137_0010_0FA26171EA0F5198"/>2. From the Connection of the Promise with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept;
<q>That Gods readiness to turn to those that turn to him, should mightily prevail with sinners to turn to him.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. From Gods promising to turn to them that turn to him;
<q>That Gods being reconciled to sinners, will infallibly follow their turning to him.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. From Gods Attribute, <hi>The Lord of Hosts,</hi> added to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm both the Precept and Promise;
<q>That if sinners break through all impediments to turn to God, as the Lord of Hosts, God will break through all difficulties to do them good, as the Lord of Hosts.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From Gods suspending his promise of turning to men, till they turn unto him, and implicitely threatning to arm all his Creatures against them for their hurt, if they do not turn to him; This Point of Doctrine may be gathered:
<q>
                  <hi>Doct. II.</hi> That it is in vain for any sinfull persons to expect Gods turning to them in mercy and favour, who do not turn unto him with true repentance and reformation; but while they continue in their sins, they must expect that God will come forth against them, as the Lord of Hosts, commanding and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his Creatures against them for their hurt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There are two parts of this Doctrine:
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>That it is in vain for any that continue in their sins, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any mercy or favour from God.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>That such ought to expect, that Gods wrath incensed against them by their sins and impenitency, may be executed against them by all and any of his Creatures, as he is the Lord of Hosts.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>In the handling of this Doctrine, I must first shew what this <hi>Turning to the Lord</hi> implies and imports. Secondly, prove
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000137_0011_0FA261725ED5B8F8"/>
the Doctrine, in both the parts of it severally.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Turning to the Lord,</hi> implies, 1. That by sin continued in, men turn from the Lord, and against the Lord: as when men turn from one another in enmity, they turn their backs one to another, and their faces to opposite objects; so it is in this case, continuers in sin turn from God and his Word, to Sin, and the World, and Satan, which are opposite to God in his holy and righteous Laws; and God turns his face and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from them, and his wrath and indignation against them. Hence it is that the Lord saith of those that disobey the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of his word, that <hi>they have turned the back to him, and not the face,</hi> Jerem. 3<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 33. and accordingly he threatneth them, that he will shew them his back, and not his face, in the day of their calamity. Thus you see what this turning to the Lord implies.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This <hi>turning to the Lord</hi> imports two things; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for, and from all their evil wayes; and Reformation of them: A hearty turning to God, through faith in Christ, and unfeigned love to God in Christ, with an universal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to his holy and righteous Rules and wayes; as they resolved in <hi>Isa.</hi> 26.13. It is true, that we cannot turn unto God of our selves, till he turn us unto himself, as you may see in <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.2, 3, 4. yet, when God calleth the vessels of mercy to turn unto him, and addeth his Promise for their encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereunto, his Spirit in and by the promise, works con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting grace in them: which works in them 1. Hearty prayer unto God to convert them, as <hi>Isai.</hi> 63.17. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31.18. <hi>Lam.</hi> 5.31. 2. Actual Conversion to God, in answer to Gods calling them thereunto, <hi>Psal.</hi> 27.8. as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.22. This turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God is right,</p>
            <p n="1">1. When it ariseth from right motives. The right motives of <hi>turning to God,</hi> are not Temporal, onely for removing of some temporal Affliction, whether felt or feared; or for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining some temporal good, which we want and desire: for such a turning is not to the Lord, but to our selves, as you may see in <hi>Hos.</hi> 7.16. with <hi>Zech.</hi> 7.5. But the right motives of <hi>turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000137_0012_0FA26174094E7A10"/>
to God</hi> are Eternal, <hi>viz.</hi> A serious and fixed apprehension of Eternal life and death, in relation to God, and his everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing favour and wrath, in the incomprehensible greatness and vastness of them: when these are not transient and vanishing, but fixed in the heart by the Spirit, and when they are looked at, not as farre off, but as present; <hi>Then</hi> they work an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall and present conversion to God. Therefore Christ taught his Disciples to use this motive in preaching the Gospel, for the conversion of sinners to God, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. and Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self used the same motive, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18, 36. and the reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause then a man seeth better and stronger reasons for his turning to God, then the world can give for his continuing in sin, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.18. from love to God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 97.10. <hi>Ye that love the Lord, hate evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. When it's done in a right manner, with the whole heart, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.12. that is, when a full resolution of turning to God, follows a full illumination and conviction; otherwise, when men have some motives to turn, but not enough, they are not fully convinced, and so they turn but by halves, and feignedly, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.10. Hence a right <hi>turning to God,</hi> is described as the Effect opening mens eyes, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. wherein is included the opening of their hearts, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 16.14. <hi>Lydia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. When it produceth sutable effects: 1. That sin, which had dominion in them, is dispossessed, and grace is made Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the house; so as though sin gets in and dwells in them, yet it is by intrusion and usurpation, as a Thief or Enemy, which are expelled as soon as they are discovered, and sufficient strength is gained. 2. That sin is hated; as the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Israel</hi> to do against <hi>Amalek,</hi> 1 Sam. 15.3. this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By their thrusting out the motions and lusts of sin out of their hearts with indignation, <hi>Isa.</hi> 30.22. and shutting the doors of the Soul, the Eyes and Ears, against temptations to it. They say in effect, as <hi>Ephraim</hi> did, in <hi>Hos.</hi> 14.8. <hi>What have I to do any more with Idols?</hi> Thus <hi>Amnon</hi> dealt with <hi>Tamar,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.15, 17.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:000137_0013_0FA261749A2471A0"/>2. By their seeking the utter destruction and full mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of sin: for, hatred is implacable against the whole kinde, as we see in a Wolf against all Sheep; nothing will satisfie but the death of its object, as the Lord commanded <hi>Israel</hi> to do against <hi>Amalek,</hi> 1 Sam. 15.3.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By a continuall fight against sin, till it be fully subdued. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. <hi>The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.11. <hi>Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which warre against the soul.</hi> Hence they will account them their best friends that help them against sin, their worst enemy.</p>
            <p>Two Reasons of the first part of the Doctrine; <hi>That it is in vain for sinfull persons to expect that God should turn to them in mercy and favour, who do not turn to him with true repentance and reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because continuers in sin do frustrate Gods end and expectation, both in all that he doth for men, and in all that he requireth to be done by them.</p>
            <p>For the first; The Church is <hi>Gods Husbandry,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.9. Ministers are the dressers of his Vineyard, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.7. the Ordinances are his manuring of it: and is not good fruit the end of Husbandry? Therefore where this follows not, what can be expected? but, as <hi>Isa.</hi> 5.5, 6, 7. God should <hi>take away the hedge thereof, break down the wall thereof, and lay it waste:</hi> and, as <hi>Luke</hi> 13.6, 7. in the Parable of the Figtree, when the dresser of the Vineyard came <hi>three years seeking fruit, and found none, Cut it down, why cumbers it the ground?</hi> Christ comes in Ordinances, and Providences; To what end? <hi>To purifie the sons of Levi, and to purge them</hi>: but when the Means attain not this End, see what follows, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.30. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate silver shall men call them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So for the second, what God requireth to be done by his people; He requireth Reading, Hearing, Meditating, Praying, Conference, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but God regardeth not these performances, except the doers of them turn unto him; if they prevail not
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000137_0014_0FA261772F07E6D8"/>
to turn men to the Lord, they are but <hi>bodily exercises, that profit little,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.8. In <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.29. <hi>Paul</hi> distinguisheth <hi>outward Circumcision,</hi> and a <hi>Jew outwardly,</hi> from that which is <hi>inward,</hi> and concludeth, that the latter <hi>hath praise of God,</hi> not the former, <hi>whose praise is onely of men,</hi> who see onely that which is outward; but God searcheth the heart, if that he turn not unto him, the rest he regardeth not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Because God rejecteth all other grounds, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon men expect that God should turn unto them his face and favour in the time of their Affliction, if this their <hi>turning unto God</hi> be wanting; <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Sinfull Childrens relation to godly Parents: <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Think not to say within your selves, We have Abraham to our father:</hi> John 8.39, <hi>to</hi> 45. <hi>Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abrahams children, you would do the works of Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Grown persons, (1) Professing Religion, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.34, <hi>to</hi> 38. (2) Covenanting with the Lord and his People, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.16, 17. Hos. 8.1, 2, 3. <hi>He shall come as an Eagle against the House of the Lord, because they have transgressed my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Church-priviledges, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.4. <hi>Trust not in lying words, saying, The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord are these.</hi> What is become of the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and of those <hi>seven Golden Candlesticks,</hi> and of the Church at <hi>Rome?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Performance of Religious Duties: <hi>Isa.</hi> 1.11—15. <hi>To what purpose is the multitude of your Sacrifices unto me, saith the Lord?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Extraordinary Humiliations: <hi>Isa.</hi> 58.3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Is not this the fast that I have chosen, to loose the bands of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, One Reason of the second part of the Doctrine; <hi>That while they continue in sin, they must expect that God will come out against them as the Lord of Hosts,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>

of God. Wherefore I may say to them, as <hi>Paul</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.22. <hi>He whom you provoke to wrath is the Lord of Hosts:</hi> All Creatures in Heaven, Earth and Sea, are his Souldiers to fight against them. Angels are called <hi>the heavenly Host,</hi> Luke 2.13. there are <hi>an innumerable company of Angels,</hi> Heb. 12.22. and they all <hi>excell in strength:</hi> one of them destroyed all the first-born of <hi>Egypt</hi> together; &amp; one destroyed an hundred eighty five thousand <hi>Assyrians</hi> in one night; <hi>the Stars in their courses fought</hi> from heaven by their influences <hi>against Sisera,</hi> Judg. 5.20. the Lord slew many of the <hi>Amorites</hi> with great Hail-stones cast down from heaven upon them. <hi>Josh.</hi> 10.11. See what Armies the Lord imployed against <hi>Egypt</hi> in the ten Plagues, <hi>Exod.</hi> Chap. 7, 8, 9, 10. and against the <hi>Israelites,</hi> Joel 1.3, 4. which are called <hi>Gods great Army,</hi> Joel 2.25. See also <hi>Amos</hi> 4.9. The time would fail me, if I should proceed unto particular Instances. When God would destroy the old World with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he <hi>opened all the Fountains of the great Deep, and the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of Heaven,</hi> to make a Deluge, so that <hi>the waters arose fifteen cubits upwards above the highest Mountains, and all flesh died that moved upon the earth,</hi> Genes. 7.20, 21. When he would destroy <hi>Sodom</hi> in a moment, he <hi>Rained Hell out of Heaven,</hi> as <hi>Salvian</hi> said; or as <hi>Moses</hi> saith, he <hi>rained upon Sodom and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw those Cities, and all their Inhabitants,</hi> Gen. 19.24, 25.</p>

               <hi>Vse</hi> 1. For the furtherance of our humiliation before the Lord, and that we may justifie the Lords righteousness in the Calamities which we have already felt, or may further fear, for our sins are great. <hi>Isa.</hi> 24.5. <hi>The earth also is defiled under the Inhabitants thereof, because they have transgressed the Laws, changed the Ordinance, and broken the everlasting Covenant.</hi> The Lord may say of us, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.23, 24, 25. <hi>But this people hath a revolting and rebellious heart, they are revolted and gone, &amp;c.</hi> and our Impenitency, as <hi>Amos</hi> 4.7. to the end.

            <p>Lastly, Turn from your evil wayes to God, and the Rules of his Word. This I might apply to sundry particulars; but at present I shall speak onely to one Abuse of this season of the Year, which is called <hi>CHRISTMAS:</hi> which is to be witnessed against, whether it be done upon a <hi>Religious,</hi> or <hi>Civil,</hi> or <hi>Mixed-Account.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. If upon a <hi>Religious Account</hi>; None can sanctifie Time to make a day holy to the Lord, but the sanctifying Spirit, in and by some Word of God in Scripture. The Feasts of <hi>Purim</hi> were Civil Festivals, called <hi>Good dayes of feasting, and sending gifts one to another,</hi> not <hi>Holy times,</hi> separated from common uses to holy. Now we no where finde warrant in Scripture for setting apart the day of <hi>Christs Nativity</hi> from common use, to religious holy use: Indeed the day of his Resurrection, the <hi>first day of the week,</hi> that is by Christ sanctified to be the Christians <hi>Christian Sabbath:</hi> for that was the beginning of Christs Exaltation, but the day of his Birth, was the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his Humiliation and Abasement; so that there is not a p<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="2">2. If upon a <hi>Civil Account</hi>; How comes Christs Name to

be used in it, that it is called <hi>CHRISTMAS-DAY?</hi> whether <hi>Mass</hi> be taken in the <hi>Saxon</hi> sense, as signifying a <hi>Feast</hi>; or in the Popish sense, special Masses being appointed and used in Popery on that day, I will not now dispute: but if in the first sense, how is this Time abused by all profane, and loose spirited persons, unto Gluttony, Drunkenness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and mis-spending of precious time, in Gaming at Cards and Dice, and other wickednesses? as if Christ was born, and given to us, to set mens lusts at liberty, and their persons to serve sin, and Satan; or as if Christians would imitate the Pagans, in their <hi>Bacchanalia,</hi> and <hi>Saturnalia,</hi> rather then Christ in his temperance, and doing good.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If upon a <hi>Mixed Account</hi>; This is not the time of Christs Nativity: for Christ was not born in Winter, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>September,</hi> as I shall evince;</p>
            <p n="1">1. From <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi>'s Taxing all the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire at the time when Christ was born, whereupon <hi>all went to be taxed, every one to his own City</hi>; which caused <hi>Joseph,</hi> with <hi>Mary</hi> his espoused Wife, to go unto <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> at that time when, and place where Christ was born, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Now the Winter had been an unfit season for such affairs and travels.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the time when the Angel reported the Birth of Christ to the Shepherds; it was when <hi>they were keeping watch over their flocks by night,</hi> Luke 2.8, 9, <hi>to</hi> 15. Now Shepherds watch their sheep by night, not in the open fields, in the Winter, but in the beginning of Autumn: in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they house them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From the description of Christs Incarnation, in <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. <hi>The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us:</hi> The word <gap reason="foreign">

abundance, but in Christ Jesus. In allusion hereunto, the conversion of the Nations to Christ, is expressed by their <hi>keeping the Feast of Tabernacles,</hi> in <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.16. Lay down therefore all former vain pretences, and yield to this Truth, <hi>That the keeping of</hi> Christmas <hi>in this season, is unseasonable, and in the manner as it is usually done, is unscripturall, irrationall, and unlawfull.</hi>

                  <hi>Doct.

            </p>
            <p>Two particulars must be cleared and proved,

            </p>
            <p n="1">I. That <hi>God will certainly turn to such in mercy</hi>; that is, he will alter the Effects of his Providences toward them, that whereas formerly they had been afflicting, now they shall be comforting, healing, restoring. Herein two things are meant;</p>
            <p>First, That he will pardon their sins, and so remove the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments of their good: <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.24, 25. <hi>Your iniquities have turned away things, and your sins have withholden good things from you.</hi> See <hi>Isa.</hi> 1.16, 18. He had exhorted them to <hi>cease to do evil, learn to do well,</hi> ver. 16, 17. And if they should ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.

Though your sins were of the deepest dye, as Crimson and Scarlet are, yet you shall be as perfectly cleansed from them all, as if you should see Scarlet become as white as Snow, or Crimson as white as Wooll, none of the former tincture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining. And because this is a thing difficult for sinners to believe, he addes, <hi>Come, let us reason together:</hi> as if he should say, It will require strong reasoning to cause you to believe this. Therefore the Lord useth strong Reasons to confirm it.</p>

               <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because he is the <hi>Lord of Hosts,</hi> by his right of Creation and Government. As they were all made by him, so they are all at his dispose, and under his command, for the good of his people: <hi>The Angels do his commandments, heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the voice of his word,</hi> Psal. 103.20. So of the Host of Heaven he saith, <hi>I have made the earth, my hands have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded,</hi> Isa. 45.12. and the Meteors, Snow, Frost, he ordereth by his Word of command, <hi>Psal.</hi> 147.15, <hi>to</hi> 19. So the blessing of the Fruits of the Earth, is by his command, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Because there is a Covenant between God in Christ, and all those who thus turn unto him: As when Kings and States of divers Nations, that were before in Warre, do make a League by Covenant, all their Subjects have a free Trade and intercourse for their mutuall good: so it is in this case; before man sinned against God, all Creatures of this great Lord of Hosts served for his good: but when he sinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, the Lord of Hosts and all his Creatures were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst man, had not Jesus Christ, the Mediator of the New Covenant, interposed himself to reconcile humbled believing sinners unto God. Hence, when any are brought into this Covenant, all his Creatures are at league with him, as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> told <hi>Job</hi> Chap. 5.23, 24. This League secures them from hurt, and assures of good from the beasts of the field: see <hi>Hos.</hi> 2.

It is an admirable <hi>Prosopopoeia,</hi> where the affections of men are ascribed to the Creatures; <hi>Jezreel</hi> looks to the fruits of the Earth, and complains of want of Wheat, and Wine, and Oil; they look to the Earth, and speak to it to receive into its bowels the Corn, as desirous to rot in it, that it might feed man; the Trees, to receive moisture from it, that they may cherish man: the Earth looks to the Heavens, with desire of Rain, and Influences from thence, that it may be fruitful; the Heavens look to God, desiring his word of Command and Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing: and all this by virtue of the Covenant.</p>

Look not only on the outward means, or instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or secondary Causes: that which is outward &amp; obvious to our sense, is but the Vial through which Gods wrath is pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.7. <hi>David</hi> knew that the natural cause of that Famine of three years in <hi>Israel,</hi> was Drought; but he rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not there, but went to enquire of the Lord, what sin was the cause of it, and received his answer, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.1. This the Lord taught <hi>Joshua</hi> to do, <hi>Josh.</hi> 7.10, 11. The people of <hi>Israel</hi> learned it by long continued Afflictions, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.39, 40.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Learn hence to look at sin as the most mischievous thing in the world, that you may hate and shun it more perfectly. When men look upon sin abstractively, onely as a thing done, they think it not so dangerous an evil as it is: therefore look at it in the effects of it, and you will see how mischievous it is. If you should know a man who is alwayes doing mischief, where ever he comes, he poisons one, stabs another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and leaves every where some prints of his villany, how dreadfull and hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full would he be unto you? Such a thing is Sin: it caused <hi>Ahabs</hi> death, and the dogs licked up his blood; and <hi>Jezabels</hi> also, burnt up <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi>; caused the Earth to open, and swallow up
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:000137_0025_0FA261C89AC9C1F0"/>
               <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi>; struck <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> dead at <hi>Peters</hi> feet. In a word, it blasts the Corn, destroys the fruits of the Trees; brings diseases on mens bodies; brings in Foreign Enemies upon people; fills the Earth with miseries, and Hell with everlasting torments.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Learn hence, that if you would have punishments removed in mercy, you must remove sin first. In diseases, till the Cause be removed, there is no Cure wrought; but if the Cause be done away, the symptomes presently vanish. They take a wrong course, that set their heads, hands, feet, and friends on work to free themselves from some Calamity, when the sin remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done away. For, 1. If the Calamity should be removed, sin not being pardoned, nor repented of, it is not removed in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but in wrath: as when a Physician takes away his Medicines, and leaves the disease uncured, it is a sign that either the Patients case is desperate, or that the Physician is willing that he should perish: and if Affliction doth a man no good, it doth him much hurt; for that which doth neither good nor hurt, is in vain: but God doth nothing in vain. But if sin be taken away, either the punishment will be taken away, or the sting of it. <hi>Obj. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid found it otherwise,</hi> 2 Sam. 12. <hi>A.</hi> Two cases, at least, must be excepted: 1. Of Scandal, when the Name of God is blasphemed, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. 2. When a lust is not sufficiently cleansed, the lust be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mortified, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.8, 10.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Speedily get sin done away; for the sentence is gone out, as soon as sin is committed, though the execution be deferred for a time, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 8.11, 12. and the Decree is in travail before it brings forth, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.2. and it may be sin is not finished, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.15. as <hi>Judas,</hi> though he was a Thief, was let alone till he had betrayed his Master. See <hi>Zech.</hi> 5.2, 3, 8, 9. Sin may lye like a sleeping debt, which is not demanded for many years, but if the debtor hath not an Acquittance, the Creditor may call for it when he will, and cast him into prison.</p>

               <hi>Vse</hi> 3. <hi>for Exhortation:</hi> To be like-minded to God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.1. You call God <hi>Father</hi>; be merciful, as your heavenly Father is merciful, especially in forgiving: and Christ teaches us in prayer

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> thereunto to forgive others that have offended us. See how Christ argues for this, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.14, 15. and he teaches us to urge it as an argument in our prayer, for the setled comfort of our forgiveness, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.4. Obj. <hi>But wherein must we follow God in this? Ans.</hi> 1. In his forgiving at the mediation of Christ, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.32. When a repenting sinner comes to Christ, and Christ mediates for him, God for Christs sake forgives; so should we one that hath offended us, and is sorry for it, and useth the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of friends, for his reconciliation to the offended party. 2. In his preventing mercy, which shews his readiness to forgive, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.20. <hi>When he was a great way off, yet coming, his father had compassion on him, ran unto him, &amp;c.</hi> was more quick to pardon, then the son to seek it: see the effect of it in the son. So should we, not stay till an offender hath come up to the height of our expectation, but encourage beginnings of repentance. 3. In not standing too strictly upon a full satisfaction, answerable to our imagination of the greatness of our wrong, which many times is above the offence, and above what we are able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the offender of. See that Parable in <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.22. <hi>to the end.</hi> 4. In his ending controversies with sinners in such a way, between himself and them, as may keep them from publick shame; whence Gods forgiving, is called his <hi>covering sin,</hi> Psal. 32.1. so should we: Therefore this is noted as the effect of love, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.8. See the description of <hi>Joseph,</hi> the reputed husband of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> Mat. 1.19. his Justice made him think of putting her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but his Love and goodness, to do it <hi>privily:</hi> the contrary is condemned in Christians, that will not arbitrate matters, but go to Law, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 4. <hi>for Comfort,</hi> to repenting sinners under Affliction: Think not that you shall never be freed from them, but be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, that if thy heart be humbled, and thy sin mortified, God is as willing as able to remove it. No man is in a hard condition, but he that hath an hard heart. See 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Humble your selves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time.</hi>
