            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THOSE who think themſelves injured or aggrieved by the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a monthly meeting, may appeal to the quarterly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; provided notice be given of ſuch intended appeal, in three months after ſuch judgment is given, which notification the monthly meeting ſhould enter on their minutes, and appoint four or more friends to attend the quarterly meeting, with a copy of their records in the caſe, ſigned by the clerk, and on the monthly meeting's behalf give reaſons for what is done, as the caſe may require, ſubmitting the ſame to the quarterly meeting. 1719.</p>
            <p>Any perſon diſſatisfied with the judgment of a quarterly meeting, may appeal from ſuch judgment to the yearly meeting, on giving the ſaid quarterly meeting, or the next enſuing, notice of ſuch intention, which ſhould be entered on the minutes, and four or more friends ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to attend the yearly meeting with the records of both the month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and quarterly meetings, in the caſe ſigned as aforeſaid, to ſpeak to the matter there, where it is to be finally determined.</p>
            <p>All perſons who may think themſelves aggrieved, not purſuing the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections given with reſpect to the time of giving notice of their appeals, ſhall be excluded from any right of appealing afterwards.</p>
            <p>In all caſes where a meeting is under the neceſſity of diſowning any member, ſuch member ought to have notice thereof, either by the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing's acquainting the party therewith, if preſent, or, if abſent, by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a friend or two for that purpoſe; likewiſe when the judgment, or teſtimony is made, a copy ſhould be delivered, or by two friends ſent to the party, with notice of the privilege of appeal if diſſatisfied: Except where the monthly meeting ſhall judge it too difficult to give ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in both, or either of the caſes aforeſaid, through the abſence or the parties.</p>

            <p>WHEN any difference ariſes between friends about their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, claims, or properties, the parties are to proceed according to the advice of the apoſtle, 1 Corinthians, vi. and the antient chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian practices, and not at any time brother go to law with brother, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept on apparent and urgent neceſſity, as is hereafter limited and expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and permiſſion from the monthly meeting obtained; but if any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing with us ſhall arreſt, ſue, or implead at law any other perſon, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame profeſſion, before he has proceeded in the method hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mentioned, or is ſo permitted by the monthly meeting; ſuch ought to be dealt with as other diſorderly perſons, and give ſatisfaction to the meeting, by condemning ſuch conduct, and in caſe of refuſal after deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate and tender dealing, they are to be diſowned by the meeting to which they belong.</p>
            <div type="section">
               <head>The manner of proceeding in caſes of difference.</head>
               <p>The party who finds he has reaſon of complaint, is firſt himſelf in a calm and friendly manner to ſpeak, or, if at a diſtance, write to the party by whom he is injured, or in danger of ſuffering his juſt right, and endeavour by gentle means, in a brotherly manner to obtain his right; but if it is ſtill refuſed, or neglected, then let him take one or two with him, either the overſeers, or ſome other judicious friends, or if they live at a diſtance, and belong to different meetings, write to, or empower one to act in like manner on his behalf, and in the ſame friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way make his claim or demand, and friends ſo accompanying the complainant, are to give their utmoſt aſſiſtance to have the matter juſtly and expeditiouſly ended, either by the parties themſelves, or by their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate aſſiſtance; and if the matter appears plain, or is an unconteſted debt, or bond againſt which no reaſonable objection is made, thoſe friends are to adviſe the party complained of, to make ſatisfaction without car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the matter further, either to arbitration or the meeting; but if
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:027023_0004_0FD2F7F509A1B6A8"/>
there is either an unſettled difference in accounts, or reaſon of debate, then if they cannot perſuade the determination thereof by the parties themſelves, or procure it by advice and aſſiſtance, they are to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade the parties to chooſe ſome ſuitable friends as arbitrators, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage themſelves to ſtand to, and abide by the determination of ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrees, as is uſual in like caſes.</p>
               <p>If either of the parties refuſe ſuch advice, or endeavours to end the difference, the one ſo refuſing ſhould be complained of to the monthly meeting, and notice of ſuch intention of complaint, that they may attend at the time appointed.</p>
               <p>When the caſe is brought into the meeting, the firſt enquiry ſhould be, whether the above-mentioned goſpel order has been duly obſerved? If not, the complaint ought to be returned, and no notice taken of it on the minutes; but if it has been regularly obſerved, then the meeting, to avoid as much as poſſible, contention and indecent noiſe, is to direct the hearing and determination thereof out of the meeting, and in order thereto, the parties may nominate each, one, or mere friends, as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the matter may require, and the meeting add, one, or more, as they ſee occaſion in the nature of the complaint, or for further ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary enquiry; and the committee ſo nominated, are to avoid all unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary delays, in their determination, and make report if poſſible to the enſuing monthly meeting.</p>
               <p>If either party refuſe to attend the arbitration, and ſubmit their cauſe, and ſtand to, and abide the award, judgment, and determination of the friends ſo nominated and appointed, ſuch perſon muſt be dealt with as one diſorderly, who regards not peace either in himſelf, or in the church, and that ſlights the love, order, and unity of the brethren; and if, after due admonition, the party perſiſt therein, let him be diſowned and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied againſt by the meeting; after which the other friend may apply to the law for remedy.</p>
               <p>But if any find themſelves aggrieved by ſuch award, judgment, or determination, and apply to the monthly meeting for a re-hearing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſaid judgment be confirmed by the meeting, let it be allowed; except in caſes where bonds are entered into by the parties to abide ſuch judgment, in which caſes it ought to be final. And if the party is ſtill diſſatisfied with the judgment of the monthly meeting, and ſhall notify
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:027023_0005_0FD2F7FA2CA4B9E8"/>
their intention of making application to have the cauſe heard by the quarterly meeting, let it be permitted, under the ſame limitations and directions as in caſes of offence againſt the church. Yet it is adviſed, that all coolly and weightily conſider the matter, before they give the meeting ſo much trouble, and not do it through a perverſe, or conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious temper; but only when they have good reaſon to believe they have juſt cauſe ſo to do, occaſioned by want of due information to the arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators, or manifeſt miſtake, or error in their judgment.</p>
               <p>And whereas there may be ſome caſes wherein the foregoing method of proceeding cannot be complied with, ſuch as the parties abſcond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with deſign to defraud their creditors, or being overloaded with debts, and other creditors generally coming on him, the claimant muſt ſuſtain manifeſt damage by the time it will take in going through the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or where there may be danger of future damage, as in caſe of executors or adminiſtrators, or ſuch as act in truſt; it may therefore be neceſſary, and it is adviſed, that the monthly meetings reſpectively, where ſuch caſes happen, and on due enquiry appear truly ſo, permit, or hold excuſed thoſe who are really neceſſiated, in the two firſt-mentioned ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to proceed otherwiſe: And in the caſe of executors or adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, where it ſhall appear to the meeting, that the matter is of import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and that it otherwiſe may be unſafe, and manifeſtly of dangerous conſequence; ſuch may be permitted to have the matter tried at law, or rather firſt in our friendly way, and then by conſent confirmed by a judgment, as the meeting may ſee occaſion upon the matter to adviſe and direct; with this caution, that the parties on both ſides concerned, ſtill appear and behave towards each other in brotherly love; and in the management of the cauſe, or aſſerting what they apprehend to be their right, that it be done with decency and moderation, without any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking, or unbecoming language: For as a bitter indecent behaviour will cauſe our profeſſion to be evilly ſpoken of, ſo on the contrary a chriſtian prudence, and meek deportment, will bear a becoming teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny even in courts, and ſhew that nothing but the nature of the caſe, and our common ſtation with our neighbours under the law of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, brings any of us there.</p>
               <p>And as it is our duty to ſeek peace with all men, and to avoid giving provocation, or juſt offence to any, it is adviſed, that friends avoid go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:027023_0006_0FD2F8036EC17B80"/>
to law with others not of our profeſſion, without due conſideration, and good grounds; having firſt in a friendly way ſhewed his opponent the juſtice of his cauſe, and offered, where he ſafely may, if the other makes any reaſonable objection, to ſubmit the matter to a neighbourly reference. That friends, alſo, give no juſt occaſion to ſuch to go to law with them, but carefully comply with their promiſes and contracts, and where they have any reaſon for objection to the demand, that they ſhew a willingneſs, and readineſs to agree it peaceably between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or ſubmit to a reference.</p>

               <p n="4">4. The arbitrators are to hear both parties fully, in the preſence of each other, whilſt either has any freſh matter to offer, until a certain time limited, by mutual agreement. Let no evidence be withheld or rejected.</p>

            <p>We earneſtly beſeech our friends, eſpecially the youth, to avoid all ſuch converſation as may tend to draw out their minds into the fooliſh and wicked paſtimes with which this age abounds, (particularly balls, gaming-places, horſe-races, and play-houſes) thoſe nurſeries of debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery and wickedneſs, the burthen and grief of the ſober part of other ſocieties, as well as of our own; practices wholly unbecoming a people under the chriſtian profeſſion, contrary to the tenor of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the goſpel, and the examples of pious men in all ages. For, as "evil communications corrupt good manners," ſo it is the duty of men profeſſing religion, who live in this world, in order to obtain a better, not only to "ſhake their hands from holding of bribes, and ſtop their ears from hearing of blood;" but alſo," to ſhut their eyes from ſeeing evil."

And where any profeſſing truth, are guilty of ſuch diſorderly or indecent practices, as ſhall give or occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion public ſcandal, if they are brought to a ſenſe thereof, either by the overſeers or other friends dealing with them as before adviſed and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or by compunction, or true ſight in themſelves, ſuch ought as ſoon as poſſible, to appear at the monthly meeting to which they belong, and there acknowledge and condemn the offence in writing under their hand, to the ſatisfaction of the meeting, and that the ſcandal may be removed, let ſuch acknowledgment or condemnation be publiſhed by the ſaid meeting, in ſuch manner as may probably become as public as the offence has been: And where any ſuch offender refuſes to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and condemn the fault, then the monthly meeting ought ſpeedily to teſtify upon record, againſt the party, and the fact, and publiſh the teſtimony ſo far as ſhall appear requiſite for the clearing of truth.</p>
            <p>And although there is no reaſon to diſown ſuch offenders as condemn their own ſcandalous actions to the ſatisfaction of the meeting, yet ſuch ought not to be immediately accounted as members in full unity; but it is fit that ſome time ſhould paſs for the trial of their ſincerity, until friends may become ſenſible of their real contrition. But if the offence committed, be only againſt the church, and not a public ſcandal, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, and condemnation by the party under hand, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed en the monthly meeting book only, is ſufficient, without further pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication; and on the offender's refuſal, the meeting ought alſo, after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate dealing and due admonition, to teſtify againſt the party accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the nature of the offence, and enter it on their own minutes, whereby ſuch perſons ſtand diſowned, till they ſhall repent, and give ſatisfaction.</p>

            <p>ADVISED that friends keep to their wonted example, and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt the ſuperſtitious obſervation of days. L. P. E. 1691.</p>
            <p>That all friends keep to the ſimplicity of truth, and our ancient teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, in calling the months and days by ſcripture names, and not by heathen. 1697.</p>
            <p>We think it may be uſeful and expedient to revive in your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, ſome of the motives which induced our ancient friends to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the vulgar appellations of the months and days, and to obſerve in their converſations, and writings, ſuch names as were agreeable to ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the practice of good men therein recorded.</p>
            <p>The children of Iſrael, the people whom God choſe out of all the families of the earth, to place his name among, and to make himſelf known unto, were ſtrictly commanded, not only to abſtain from the idolatrous practices of the nations in the midſt of whom they dwelt, but were enjoined to be " circumſpect in all things that the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded," and even to " make no mention of the names of other gods, neither to let it be heard out of their mouth." Exod. xxiii. 13. This injunction was not relative to any legal or typical rites, external cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, or inſtitutions of the law peculiar to the Jewiſh nation; but was a perpetual command, and ſtanding ordinance, reſpecting the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the one Almighty Being, the ſame yeſterday, to-day, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; and as ſuch ought to be regarded by us, and by all the generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe who with the heart believe, as well as with the tongue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, " that the Lord he is God, and that there is none elſe beſides him."

Deut iv. 35. Who hath declared, " I am the Lord, that is my name, and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praiſe to graven images." Iſaiah xlii. 8. Convinced of this great and everlaſting truth, both by the teſtimony of the holy ſcripture, and the manifeſtation of that divine principle, which leads thoſe who are faithful to its teachings, from all that would diſhonour the name of God, either in word or deed; our ancient friends were conſcientiouſly concerned to refrain from the uſe of thoſe names of months, and days, which had been aſcribed by way of honour to the idols of the heathen, and in conformity to their falſe worſhips: This concern reſted upon them from a firm perſuaſion, that the glorious goſpel day, and time was come, wherein the Lord was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his covenant with Iſrael, viz. " I will take away the names of <note n="*" place="bottom">This word Baalim, being the plural number of Baal, ſignifying Lord, has relation to the names of divers idols of the heathen, worſhipped in ſeveral places.</note>Baalim out of his mouth, and they ſhall no more be remembered by their names." Hoſea ii. 17.</p>
            <p>And that you may the more clearly diſcern the importance of that chriſtian teſtimony, borne by our predeceſſors in this caſe, we recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend what follows to your ſerious conſideration, viz.</p>
            <p>A brief account of the origin of the names of ſome months of the year, and of all the days of the week, now cuſtomarily and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. January, was ſo called from Janus, an ancient king of Italy, whom heatheniſh ſuperſtition had deified, to whom a temple was built and this month dedicated.</item>
               <item>II. February, was ſo called from Februa, a word denoting purgation by ſacrifices; it being uſual in this month for the prieſts of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then god, Pan, to offer ſacrifices, and perform certain rites, conducing, as was ſuppoſed, to the cleanſing, or purgation of the people.</item>
               <item>III. March, was ſo denominated from Mars, feigned to be the god of war, whom Romulus, founder of the Roman empire, pretended to be his father.</item>
               <item>IV. April, is generally ſuppoſed to derive its name from the Greek appellation of Venus, an imaginary goddeſs worſhipped by the Romans.</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:027023_0012_0FD2F7D8ACAD06E8"/>V. May, is ſaid to have been ſo called, from Maia, the mother of Mercury, another of their pretended ethnic deities, to whom in this month they paid their devotions.</item>
               <item>VI. June, is ſaid to take its name from Juno, one of the ſuppoſed goddeſſes of the heathen.</item>
               <item>VII. July, ſo called from Julius Caeſar, one of the Roman empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, who gave his own name to this month, which before was called Quintilis, or the fifth.</item>
               <item>VIII. Auguſt, ſo named in honour of Auguſtus Caeſar, another of the Roman emperors; this month was before called Sextilis, or the ſixth.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The other four months, namely, September, October, November, December, ſtill retain their numerical Latin names, which according to the late regulation of the Calendar, will for the future be improperly applied, however from the continued uſe of them hitherto, as well as from the practice of the Jews, before the Babyloniſh captivity it ſeems highly probable, that the method of diſtinguiſhing the months by their numerical order only, was the moſt ancient, as it is the moſt plain, ſimple, and rational.</p>
            <p>As the idolatrous Romans thus gave names to ſeveral of the months, in honour of their pretended deities, ſo the like idolatry prevailing among our Saxon anceſtors, induced them to call the days of the week, by the name of the idol, which on that day they peculiarly worſhipped. Hence</p>
            <list>
               <item>The Firſt day of the week, was by them called Sunday, from their cuſtomary adoration of the Sun upon that day.</item>
               <item>The Second day of the week, they called Monday, from their uſual cuſtom of worſhipping the Moon on that day.</item>
               <item>The Third day of the week, they named Tueſday, in honour of one of their idols called Tuiſco.</item>
               <item>The Fourth day of the week, was called Wedneſday, from the appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Woden, another of their idols.</item>
               <item>The Fifth day of the week, was called Thurſday, from the name of an idol called Thor, to whom they paid their devotions upon that day.</item>
               <item>The Sixth day of the week, was termed Friday, from the name of Friga, an imaginary goddeſs by them worſhipped.</item>
               <item>The Seventh day, they ſtiled Saturday, as is ſuppoſed from Saturn, or Seater, by them then worſhipped.</item>

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:027023_0013_0FD2F7B105CC8EE0"/>In the ages of Popiſh ſuperſtition, not only the uſe of ſuch heatheniſh names and cuſtoms were indulged, but alſo other unſound and unſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural practices in religion were invented and introduced. For when the profeſſion of the chriſtian religion became national, multitudes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then prieſts, whoſe intereſt lay in the performance of rites, ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and ſacrifices, embraced prevailing chriſtianity with ſelfiſh views, and laboured early with too much ſucceſs to find employment for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by impoſing on the people a new ſet of ceremonies and ſacrifices, bearing ſome reſemblance to thoſe, which in their former ſtate of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm they had been accuſtomed to. From this corrupt ſource ſprang the popiſh ſacrifice of the maſs, the celebration of which, at particular times, and on particular occaſions, gave riſe to the vulgar names of Michaelmas, Martinmas, Chriſtmas, and the like.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore that theſe appellations and names of days, months, and times, are of an idolatrous or ſuperſtitious original, contrary to the divine command, the practice of good and holy men in former ages, and repugnant to the chriſtian teſtimony borne by our faithful friends and predeceſſors in the truth, for the ſake of which they pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently endured many revilings; let neither the reproach of ſingularity, nor the ſpecious reaſonings of ſuch as would evade the croſs of Chriſt, turn you aſide from the ſimplicity of the goſpel, nor diſcourage you from keeping to the language of truth, in denominating the months and days, according to the plain and ſcriptural way of expreſſion, thereby following the example of our worthy elders, and coming up in a noble and honourable teſtimony againſt theſe, and all other remains of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and ſuperſtition.</p>
            <p>Where there is diſagreement in the conduct of friends, reſpecting the obſervance of days appointed by the government for faſts, and the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the windows of their houſes, upon what are called rejoicing nights, which not only affords occaſion of triumph to the enemies of truth, but likewiſe increaſes the weight of the ſufferings of ſuch friends as are conſcientiouſly concerned to maintain inviolably our ancient and chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an teſtimony in theſe reſpects; it is deſired and adviſed, that where a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of this kind appears, ſome ſolid and weighty friends be appointed by the reſpective monthly meetings, to treat with the unfaithful herein, in a ſpirit of love and tenderneſs, in order that ſuch may be awakened to a ſerious conſideration of their duty, and encouraged to a faithful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge thereof. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>ADVISED that friends exert good endeavours and care in all meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of buſineſs, for the preſervation of good order and wholeſome diſcipline; that their hands ſlack not therein; that they, every where, may apply to the Lord, who gives wiſdom, and will not fail thoſe who ſeek it in humility and fear, ſo that overſeers and heads of families may be enabled reſpectively to diſcharge their duties and truſt, in a chriſtian meek ſpirit, for it is <hi>that</hi> gives weight and ſucceſs to our labours; let us all therefore guard againſt the warmth of our own ſpirits, and let love, the mark of our diſcipleſhip, govern in all our behaviour one towards another.</p>
            <p>The love and friendſhip of this world, and ſpirit of it, covetouſneſs, pride, ſelf-intereſt and inordinate purſuit after lawful things, not only obſtruct the growth of truth in ſome hearts; but alſo hinder many from coming forward as they otherwiſe might do, to carry on the good work of diſcipline, and perform other offices of love and ſervice in the church of Chriſt: Let us therefore earneſtly ſeek to the ſearcher of all hearts, for his divine aid to diveſt ourſelves of theſe, and all other hindering things, that many more labourers may be fitted and made willing to come forward in this part of the Lord's harveſt; that where any are found weak or faulty, they may without partiality be admoniſhed in the ſpirit of love and divine charity, ſo that it may be ſeen by all, that the reſtoring ſpirit of meekneſs and chriſtian love abound before church cenſure comes, and that a goſpel ſpirit is the ſpring and motive of all our performances, as well in diſcipline as worſhip. But if any decline or let fall any branch of our teſtimony, they are to be ſpeedily dealt with, according to the good order and diſcipline eſtabliſhed among us. See meetings for diſcipline.</p>
            <p>In order to unite us the more nearly one to another, as members of the ſame body, and to ſtrengthen our hands to promote the general cauſe of truth; it is recommended to friends, to ſtand open to the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:027023_0015_0FD2F8138EF7E0F0"/>
leadings of the love of God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord: And when they feel drawings in their minds to ſit with any of their neighbouring monthly or quarterly meetings, that they attend thereto; and that ſuch monthly or quarterly meetings as are ſo viſited, receive ſuch as they know to be well approved at home, in the love of God, and not to look upon them as intruders: ſo ſhall mutual help be given and received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, and we truly be a people led by one and the ſame ſpirit. 1759.</p>
            <p>Let a neceſſary enquiry be raiſed in the minds of all members of the church, who have had any part of the Lord's work upon them, how they have acquitted themſelves therein, and diſcharged themſelves in the ſight of God; foraſmuch as a day comes on apace, in which an account of our ſtewardſhip will be required at our hands. The diſcipline of the ſociety would again be revived, and ſtrengthened, if this awful ſenſe of rendering an account of our truſt, and the importance of being clear from the blood of all men, were enough impreſſed upon all minds. And, dear friends, as it is the Lord's work, let it be done as in his ſight. Let all our anſwers to the queries be plain and explicit. Let a due ſenſe of the ſtate of the church prevail on your minds, rather than an unwillingneſs to appear deficient among your brethren. May a ſuitable engagement of mind prevail on all the active members of the church, to acquit themſelves with faithfulneſs, that they may at laſt receive the crown of righteouſneſs, which will never fade away.</p>

And for the aſſiſtance of thoſe immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately concerned, let the monthly meeting, where the marriage is allowed, appoint two men friends, and two women friends, to attend and take care, as much as they can, that all behave as is above adviſed; and if any thing to the contrary is obſerved, let them, as ſoon as they can with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency, and decency, take ſuch as make ſuch breach on good order, moderation or modeſty, aſide, and in love and tenderneſs admoniſh and caution them to better behaviour, and to be more watchful over their words and actions: And the ſaid friends are to make report to the next monthly meeting, reſpecting the decency and order obſerved at the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; and the monthly meeting is alſo to take the needful care that the certificate be properly recorded in a book to be kept for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>It is adviſed that friends avoid all unneceſſary preparations and invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at marriages.</p>
            <p>Inaſmuch as any marriage of near kindred, in the times of the law, was in condeſcenſion, and upon ſuch extraordinary occaſions as holding up their tribes, and that the nearer their marriages were the more unholy they were accounted; we, in our day, ought not to approach our near kindred in any ſuch reſpect, particularly firſt couſins, being redeemed out of thoſe kindreds, tribes, and earthly lots; (for the upholding of which marriages within the kindred were once diſpenſed with) and brought to that ſpiritual diſpenſation, which gives dominion over the affections, and leads to thoſe marriages which are more natural and of better report.</p>
            <p>And though ſome through weakneſs, have been drawn into ſuch mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, (which being done muſt not be broken) yet let not their practices be a precedent, or example to any others amongſt us for the time to come.</p>
            <p>Monthly meetings ought to be careful in paſſing or allowing of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages of near kindred; and, where any uneaſineſs in this reſpect appears, take the advice of the yearly meeting thereon, rather than proceed in doubtful caſes.</p>

            <head>MEETINGS for DISCIPLINE.</head>
            <p>AGREED, that no quarterly meeting be ſet up, or laid down without the conſent of the yearly meeting; no monthly, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, or other meeting of buſineſs, or worſhip, without application to, and conſent of the quarterly meeting.</p>
            <p>Theſe meetings are ſubordinate, and accountable to each other in the following order, viz. The preparative to the monthly, the monthly to the quarterly, and the quarterly to the yearly meeting: So that if the yearly meeting is at any time diſſatisfied with the proceedings of any of the ſaid meetings, or the quarterly with that of the monthly, or the monthly with the preparative, within their limits, ſuch meetings ought reſpectively, with readineſs to render a ſatisfactory account.</p>
            <p>Let each preparative meeting chooſe two men friends, and two wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men friends, to attend the monthly meeting, and preſent on behalf, and by order of ſaid preparative meeting, what ſhall be given in charge; each monthly meeting a ſufficient number, to attend the quarterly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which they belong, and preſent on behalf of the reſpective monthly meeting, what ſhall be given them in charge, which ought to be in writing and for the like ſervice let each quarterly meeting ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point at leaſt four friends of each ſex, as repreſentatives to the yearly meeting.</p>
            <p>Let minutes, or due entries be made in every monthly, and quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meeting, of all ſuch matters as come before them, and are determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or that may be removed from the monthly to the quarterly, or from that to the yearly meeting.</p>
            <p>Let all marriages, marriage-certificates, births and burials, be record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in each monthly meeting; alſo an account of friends ſufferings, for their teſtimony againſt hireling miniſters, and war, which ought to be transferred to the quarterly, and from thence to the yearly meeting.</p>
            <p>If any monthly or quarterly meeting have occaſion for, and requeſt any of the records of another monthly or quarterly meeting, it is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that the meeting ſo requeſting may be furniſhed with ſuch copies.</p>

               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:027023_0024_0FD2F8155AB835C0"/>That full endeavours be uſed in every monthly meeting, to end, with the utmoſt diſpatch, all buſineſs that ariſes or is brought for their determination, and if any matter be referred from one meeting to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, let the reaſon be minuted why it is referred; but if they find any thing too weighty or inconvenient for them to determine, they may move it to the quarterly meeting, and after due care and endeavours to end any matter, or difference, the quarterly meeting may move it to the yearly meeting.</p>
            <p>The method of dealing with diſorderly perſons, or ſuch as give of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, either to the church, or particular members, is very excellently preſcribed by the ſaviour of mankind. Matthew, xviii. 15, 16, 17.
<q>If thy brother ſhall treſpaſs againſt thee, go and tell him his fault be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thee and him alone, if he ſhall hear thee, thou haſt gained thy brother; but if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witneſſes every word, may be eſtabliſhed, and if he ſhall neglect to hear them, tell it to the church; but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be to thee as an heathen man, and a publican.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The eminent apoſtle in his epiſtle to the Philippians, has theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions: Chap. iv. 8.
<q>Finally, brethren, whatſoever things are true, whatſoever things are honeſt, whatſoever things are juſt, whatſoever things are pure, whatſoever things are lovely, whatſoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, if there be any praiſe, think, on theſe things.</q>
Now whatſoever appears in any contrary to theſe, may in general, be ſaid to come under the notice of friends, overſeers, and meeting. And although it is a duty incumbent on meetings, and every faithful member, where any diſcords, or unbecoming practices come to their knowledge, to adviſe, admoniſh, or treat with ſuch as are guilty, yet that it may not be neglected, it ought to be, more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly and directly the buſineſs and ſervice of the overſeers.</p>
            <p>And it is adviſed, that in ſpeaking to, or dealing with any, it may be done in a chriſtian ſpirit of love and tenderneſs, by laying the evil before them, labouring in meekneſs to bring ſuch to a ſenſe of it in themſelves, that they may, if poſſible, be reſtored. And although ſuch as tranſgreſs or looſe their hold of truth are apt, while in that condition, to oppoſe or be teſty; yet we ought patiently and meekly to inſtruct
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:027023_0025_0FD2F7B85029B200"/>
and adviſe them, ſo that we may not only have a teſtimony of peace in ourſelves, but may ſo affect the ſpirits of thoſe to whom we ſpeak, as that they may be ſenſible we have performed a truly chriſtian duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them in brotherly love; after which tender dealing, if any reject the admonition or counſel, the overſeers or ſuch as deal with them, are to acquaint the preparative meeting thereof, that further care may be taken, according to the eſtabliſhed rule among friends.</p>
            <p>Beſides, all other notorious crimes or groſs wickedneſs, if any happen, the following practices ought zealouſly to be taken care of and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, viz. Exceſſive drinking, ſwearing, curſing, lying, unlawful or unſeemly keeping company with women, or any other ſcandalous practices.</p>
            <p>And it is the buſineſs of the overſeers, or other weighty friends, to ſpeak to, or deal with ſuch as are at difference or ſtrife, either about their intereſt in worldly affairs, or other reſentments, adviſing an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among themſelves and ſpeedy reconciliation, to avoid if poſſible, bringing any troubleſome buſineſs to meetings which may be otherwiſe ended; but if they cannot prevail, they are then to take the methods preſcribed for proceeding in ſuch caſe.—See conduct and converſation.</p>
            <p>Such as frequently neglect, or do not in due time, attend meetings, thoſe on week-days as well as firſt-days, but ſtay away on light trivial, or ordinary occaſions; a conſtant, or frequent neglect being a mark of declenſion, and when it becomes remarkable, ſuch ſhould be more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly dealt with and admoniſhed; alſo, if any, old or young, when come to meeting fall aſleep, go out and in frequently, or otherwiſe dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb the meeting, let them be rebuked and cautioned, firſt privately, and all parents, maſters and miſtreſſes ought to have a care over their children and ſervants in that reſpect, and caution them accordingly.</p>
            <p>Such as keep company in order for marriage with thoſe not of our profeſſion, or with any ſervant or apprentice without the conſent of the maſter or miſtreſs. Such as marry out of the unity of friends, or any method but the decent and orderly way uſed amongſt friends. Such as go themſelves, or ſuffer their children to go to marriages conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted contrary to the rules of our diſcipline, either of thoſe that have profeſſed with us, or thoſe of other ſocieties, without giving a ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory reaſon for their going, as the levity and wanton behaviour too frequently at ſuch times, may be a means of corrupting the minds of

youth, and ſtrengthening them in that diſorder which is not conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with our holy profeſſion. Such as do not keep themſelves and their children to moderation and plainneſs, in jeſture, ſpeech and apparel, in furniture of houſes, and ſuch things as have been cautioned againſt, either by the yearly meeting in London, or the yearly meeting here. Such as trade by ſea or land, or buy or contract beyond their abilities, and ſuch as keep not their words or engagements in their dealing, theſe being a reproach to truth, and a manifeſt injury, are to be ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adviſed, and if they do not amend they are further to be proceeded againſt. Such as run races on horſe-back, or on foot, lay wages, or uſe any gaming, or needleſs and vain ſports and paſtimes. Such as do not maintain our ancient chriſtian teſtimonies againſt taking oaths, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary ſervices, bearing arms, clandeſtine or illicit trade, purchaſing prize goods, and being concerned in lotteries of any kind. Such as are guilty of tattling, tale-bearing, reproaching, back-biting, evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeaking of their brethren or neighbours, or buſily meddling with the affairs of others, where they are not concerned; the tendency of which being to raiſe ſtrife and diſcord, or cauſe diſeſteem among brethren and neighbours. Such as write, print, or publiſh, any books or writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, tending to raiſe contention, or occaſion breach of unity, that have not firſt had the approbation of ſome friends appointed by the yearly meeting for that purpoſe. If any ſhall take upon them pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly to oppoſe any miniſtring friend (in unity, or not diſowned) in exhortation, or preaching; keep on the hat, or ſhew any other remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſlike in time of prayer, let them be ſpeedily dealt with as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly perſons, who endanger the peace, and oppoſe the charity and brotherhood of the church, unleſs they condemn the ſame in ſuch manner as the meeting may think requiſite; but if they have any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable objection againſt what was delivered, they are firſt to ſpeak to the friend privately, and proceed orderly.</p>

            <p>MINISTERS are to be approved by the monthly meeting of which they are members, and by them recommended before they are permitted to ſit in the meetings of miniſters and elders, or to travel abroad as miniſters.</p>
            <p>The ſpirit of God being the foundation of all true knowledge and experience, both in miniſters and hearer, we earneſtly exhort that all would diligently wait upon and mind it: Miniſters, in their public ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices eſpecially, ought always to attend cloſely to their ſeveral and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar gifts, and miniſter the word faithfully as it is manifeſted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to them; obſerving a decent and modeſt behaviour, in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their miniſtrv, and not entangling; themſelves with the affairs of this life, that they may the better anſwer the holy warfare in which they are engaged, and let the hearers be watchful over their own ſpirits, and not forwardly judge, or cenſure the teſtimonies which may be delivered amongſt them; for if they be not very careful and diligent in attending upon the Lord in meetings, they are liable to miſtake in the judgment they may paſs on the miniſtry.</p>
            <p>Now this being a matter of great moment, for the preſervation of love and concord, in the churches; and knowing the danger and ill conſequences, which attend a haſty and cenſorious judging of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, we think it neceſſary to caution friends not to let their own ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſway them, but let the ſpirit of God rule and reign in their hearts; for this will preſerve all in ſweetneſs, and tenderneſs one towards another: The due obſervance of which, will be a great help to miniſters in the diſcharge of their duty, and the ſervice to which they are called.</p>
            <p>We further adviſe all monthly meetings, to take great care in giving certificates to thoſe who travel, to prevent the uneaſineſs which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times falls on the church, from a weak and unſkilful miniſtry; and let the elders, when they ſee occaſion, adviſe miniſters to be very prudent in their conduct, not as buſy-bodies, nor meddling with family, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:027023_0028_0FD2F81F58762560"/>
affairs, in which they are not concerned, or required to be aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; that they be very tender of one another's reputation, and that of friends among whom they travel; neither giving ear to, nor ſpreading reports tending to raiſe in the minds of others a diſeſteem of any; and as ſoon as their ſervice in the miniſtry is over, that they return to their habitations, and there take a reaſonable and prudent care of their own buſineſs, houſehold, and family.</p>
            <p>That there be held in each monthly meeting, a ſelect meeting of miniſters and elders, once in three months; when being met together, after ſome time ſpent in ſolid retirement, they may proceed to read and conſider the queries annexed, and form general anſwers, to the firſt, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third quarterly meetings of miniſters and elders; but to the quarterly meeting preceding the yearly meeting, they ſhould all be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and diſtinctly anſwered, and as near in the words of the query as may be; that a ſuitable number be appointed as repreſentatives to the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly meeting, and by the quarterly meeting, to the yearly meeting of miniſters and elders.</p>
