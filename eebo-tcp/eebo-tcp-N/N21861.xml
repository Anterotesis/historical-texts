            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE <hi>MILLENNIUM.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THOUGH there has been no age of the Church in which the Millenium was not admitt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by individual divines of the firſt eminence, it is yet evident, from the writings of Euſebius, Irenaeus, Origen, and others among the ancients, as well as from the hiſtories of Dupin, Moſheim, and all the moderns, that it was never adopted by the whole church, or made an article of the eſtabliſhed creed in any nation.</p>
            <p>About the middle of the fourth century the Millinarians held the following tenets:</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. That the city of Jeruſalem ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built, and that the land of Judea ſhould be the habitation of thoſe who are to reign on earth one thouſand years.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. That the firſt reſurrection was not to be confined to the martyrs, but that after the fall of Antichriſt all the juſt were to riſe, and all that were on the earth were to continue for that ſpace of time.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. That Chriſt ſhall then come down from Heaven, and be ſeen on earth, and reign there with his ſervants.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:028789_0003_0FDD458706FCCD98"/>4th. That the ſaints, during this period, ſhall enjoy all the delights of a terreſtial paradiſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe opinions were founded upon ſeveral paſſages of Scripture, which the Millenarians, among the fathers, underſtood in no other than a literal ſenſe; but which the moderns, who hold that opinion, conſider as partly literal and partly metaphorical. Of theſe paſſages, that upon which the greateſt ſtreſs has been laid is the following: "And I ſaw an angel come down from Heaven, having the key of the bottomleſs pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old ſervant, which is the devil and Satan, and bound him a <hi>thouſand years,</hi> and caſt him into the bottomleſs pit, and ſhut him up, and ſet a ſeal upon him, that he ſhould deceive the nations no more till the <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years</hi> ſhall be fulfilled, and after that he muſt be looſed a little ſeaſon. And I ſaw thrones, and they ſat upon them, and judgment was giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en unto them, and I ſaw the ſouls of them that were beheaded for the witneſs of Jeſus, and for the word of God, and which had not worſhipp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the beaſt, neither his image, neither had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands, and they lived and reigned with Chriſt a <hi>thouſand years.</hi> But the reſt of the dead lived not again till the <hi>thouſand years were finiſhed.</hi> This is the firſt reſurrection. Rom. xx. 1—6.</p>
            <p>This paſſage all the ancient Millenarians took
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:028789_0004_0FDD458AD5C02550"/>
in a ſenſe groſsly literal, and taught, that during the Millennium, the ſaints on earth were to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy every bodily delight. The moderns, on the other hand, conſider the power and pleaſure of this kingdom as wholly ſpiritual, and they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them as not to commence till after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration of the preſent earth. But that this laſt ſuppoſition is a miſtake the very next verſe but one evinces; for it is there ſaid, that "when the thouſand years are expired Satan ſhall be looſed out of his priſon, and ſhall go out to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the nations which are in the four quarters of <hi>the earth;</hi>" and there is no reaſon to believe that he will have ſuch power or ſuch liberty in "the new heavens and the <hi>new earth,</hi> wherein dwelleth righteouſneſs."</p>

            <head>A CALCULATION ON THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE <hi>MILLENNIUM.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>MR Brothers has taken much pains to adjuſt and aſcertain the Bible chronology. He gives it in detail at the opening of his firſt book and alludes to it in ſeveral parts of the ſecond, as holding out to men an evident proof that the time for the completion of ancient prophecies, and the recorded period for the execution of God's Judgments is really arrived. But the connection between the age of the world, viz. 5913 years, in A. D. 1794, and this predetermined reſolution of the Almighty, is by no means apparent at firſt fight, or to a curſory obſerver. Something more is certainly neceſſary to develope the myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and the following is an attempt to eluci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date it by computation.</p>
            <p>Alluſions to the <hi>Millennium</hi> are to be found in all parts of Scripture; and the doctrine ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally received is, that the Moſaic account of the creation of the world is a prophetical type of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028789_0006_0FDD458E14F8A700"/>
its duration: taking (according to St. Peter, 2d Eph. chap. iii. ver. 8.) one thouſand years <hi>for one day.</hi> So that we are to underſtand the world to have been deſtined to laſt 6000 <hi>years</hi> under the yoke of labour and tribulation, (metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſignified by the labours of God in the <hi>ſix days of</hi> creation) and one <hi>thouſand</hi> years under that diſpenſation which is typified by God's reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Sabbath-day, and which is called Chriſt's Kingdom, or the Kingdom of Heaven, or the dominion of the Saints, &amp;c. &amp;c. when it is expreſsly ſaid, that the Saints ſhould enter into the <hi>reſt of God,</hi> and <hi>e converſo</hi> of the wicked, it is ſaid, "unto whom I ſware in my wrath that <hi>they ſhould not enter into my reſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, if we ſuppoſe the 5913 years, above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned by Mr. Brothers, to be common years of ſolar time, we find 87 years ſtill wanting to arrive at the cloſe of the ſix ſymbolical days of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and conſequently we are too remote from the period of the Millennium to have any thing either to hope or fear perſonally from its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. But if we advert to that mode of calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation univerſally adopted, both by Daniel and St. John in their prophecies; where not only a day is taken for a year, but a month invariably made to contain 30 ſuch days, and 42 months to comprehend 1260 ſuch days, and theſe 1260 days to form exactly three years and a half, and therefore every ſuch year to conſiſt of 360 ſuch
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028789_0007_0FDD458F4E74F550"/>
days. We may very well adopt this method of computation in our endeavours to explain any prophetical chronology, and may very fairly call thoſe <hi>Divine years,</hi> by which, as Mr. Brothers expreſſes it, <hi>"God fulfils his recorded judgments."</hi> Now admitting the common ſolar year to conſiſt of 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 54¾ ſeconds, and multiplying 5913 years into quarters of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds, we ſhall find, on dividing this quotient by 360, a produce amounting to 5999 ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine years and a fraction; which fraction, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted from the ſum total of one year, leaves a deficiency, at the end of the year of our Lord 1794, equal to 322 days 6 hours 40 minutes 23¼ ſeconds, being ſo much wanting, at the opening of the preſent year, to the full completion of 6000 <hi>divine</hi> or <hi>prophetical</hi> years: and ſhewing that the Millenium will commence, on the 19th of November next, at or about ſun-riſe, in the latitude of Jeruſalem.</p>
            <p>If this calculation be true, it follows that the time during which "the Saints ſhall live and reign with Chriſt," which according to St. John, in Rev. chap. xx. ver. 4, is <hi>one thouſand years,</hi> muſt be in fact 360,000 years. So that the Millennium will bear the ſame analogical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the previous duration of the world as that very previous duration itſelf holds to the ſix original days of the creation.</p>

            </head>
            <p>I HAVE endeavoured to peruſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice, every thing that has been written <hi>in anſwer to,</hi> or rather <hi>againſt</hi> my book: and if I had in any of the publications met with a ſingle paragraph worthy of an anſwer, it ſhould have been anſwered. The ſelf-ſufficient and abuſive Dr. Horne of Oxford, has not one word of truth, or argument, or common ſenſe, in his whole pamphlet; nor would it have miſbecome a Doctor of Divinity who, by his own pen, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes he can neither underſtand Greek, nor read the Goſpel in Engliſh—to have endeavoured at leaſt to give his jargon ſomething, if poſſible, <hi>of the Gentleman.</hi> That he does not underſtand Greek, is clear from his doubting whether the Holy Ghoſt appeared in <hi>ſhape of a dove,</hi> when St. Luke expreſsly ſays, <gap reason="foreign">

And as for the phraſe of <hi>ſelling my ſoul,</hi> which ſeems to have given ſuch alarm, and furniſhed ſo much matter for falſe wit, I <hi>now think</hi> that every man who enters into Parliament <hi>with any perſonal view whatever,</hi> and not wholly and excluſively for the ſervice of his country, muſt be deemed <hi>bona fide</hi> to have ſold his ſoul—let him be of what party he will; and alſo that every man who joins <hi>any party</hi> to vote on all occaſions for the purpoſe of promoting or ſupporting that party at all events, is perpetually guilty of the ſame act of <hi>ſelling his ſoul.</hi> I deny having ever ſold my ſoul in any other manner than this:—and if any one think or ſay other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, on him be the <hi>onus probandi.</hi>

            <head>CURSORY REMARKS ON THE PAMPHLET INTITULED, <hi>"THE AGE OF CREDULITY."</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE anonymous Author of a pamphlet, intitled, <hi>"The Age of Credulity,"</hi> was ſo oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as to ſend the book yeſterday to me; with an opinion, I preſume, that I ſhould find its ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments incontrovertible, and the poſitions I have aſſumed in my own publication totally untenable. I ſhould be ſorry to interrupt the gentleman's tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph by any unſeaſonable ſeverity, and I am ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly averſe to all argument for argument's ſake.</p>
            <p>I ſhall, therefore, only beg him to take in good part the few hints which I here haſtily throw out for his conſideration.</p>
            <p>If he had turned to Cruden's Concordance, article "Wing," he would have found (4th ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification "it is put for the ſails of a ſhip," Iſaiah xviii. 1. <hi>"Woe to the land ſhadowing with wings;"</hi> meaning Egypt, which abounded with ſhips, "whoſe <hi>ſails</hi> were like <hi>wings</hi> that ſhadow the ſea."</p>
            <p>So much for his pithy objection in the 15th page. The grand <hi>cheval de battaille</hi> of all my doughty opponents has been Daniel's viſion, as explained by certain former clear-ſighted expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028789_0012_0FDD459E204FE190"/>
to mean four ſucceſſive monarchies; viz. Babylonian, Mede-Perſian, Grecian, and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.—I have been ſo bartered and annoyed with this ridiculous phantom, that I ſhall here demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it altogether, at once, for the peace of the public, as well as my own.</p>
            <p>Daniel ſaw this viſion after Nebuchadnezzer <hi>was dead,</hi> as is evident from the firſt verſe of the ſeventh chapter. After this, what does my ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymous author think of the ſuppoſition mentioned in his 14th page? The four beaſts meant mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs, and not <hi>monarchies.</hi> See the 12th verſe. "As concerning the reſt of the beaſts, they had their dominion taken away, yet their lives were prolonged for a ſeaſon and time." The <hi>life of a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion</hi> I can conceive to be a poetical phraſe, and admit its propriety; but to take away the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion from a dominion, and yet prolong the life of that dominion, is too much even for me, with all my credulity, to comprehend.</p>
            <p>Daniel ſaw this viſion in the firſt year of the reign of Belſhazzar, the very laſt king of Babylon, who loſt his life at the ſame moment with his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and therefore his life certainly was not prolonged for a <hi>ſeaſon</hi> nor a <hi>time.</hi> And in the 17th verſe of this ſame ſeventh chapter, the angel tells Daniel, "Theſe great beaſts, which are four, are four kings, which ſhall ariſe out of the earth,"—<hi>ſhall</hi> ariſe—in the future tenſe; not, one of whom is already riſen,—and <hi>kings,</hi> not
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028789_0013_0FDD459F1C22A300"/>
               <hi>kingdoms.</hi> From this verſe nothing can be more undubitable, than that the king or kingdom of Babylon is totally out of the queſtion; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other three monarchies, in the common interpretation, all neceſſarily fall to the ground as veſting on this baſe. I hope I ſhall never here them mentioned again. My author hampers himſelf again in his 21ſt page, on the ſimilitude and diſſimilitude between the fourth beaſt of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel and the eagle of Eſdras. If he will cavil at nothing, or every thing, let him. But if he chooſe to read and think ingenuouſly for himſelf, he might find, that Daniel omits in his fourth beaſt, as in the other three, to make any mention of the riſe or ſplendour, or even exiſtence of <hi>monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies:</hi> His beaſts are mere perſonages, and his fourth the Emperor of Germany; ſubſtitute for, and ſtanding avowedly and oſtentatiouſly in the place of the ancient emperors of Rome. Eſdras delineates the monarchy or kingdom itſelf, of which he expreſsly ſays, in the 12th chapter and 12th verſe of the ſecond book, that the Lord told him this kingdom <hi>"was not expounded unto his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Daniel,"</hi> and therefore it was now explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him. Eſdras ſaw the whole hiſtory in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail, and even what would come to paſs after the death of the preſent Emperor of Germany, the preſent Pope, and preſent King of Pruſſia, the three heads of his eagle: whereas Daniel only beheld the preſent Emperor and electors of the
<pb facs="unknown:028789_0014_0FDD45A0936170E8"/>
Germanic body, without a glimpſe of the Anti-chriſt or of the pope.</p>
            <p>By the <hi>ſale of ſouls,</hi> pages 24 and 25, (for I am not writing a regular anſwer to a pamphlet) which is too inſignificant to deſerve one; but haſtily running over a few of its capital errors, is meant <hi>a conſcious ſale of an article known to be in one's own poſſeſſion.</hi> Thoſe who purchaſe pardons and indulgences of popes, are not in this predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament.</p>
            <p>Of Mr. Brothers's <hi>preſumption, ignorance and artifice,</hi> of which he is accuſed in the 27th, and ſubſequent pages, I ſhall take no notice: my au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor may compare his own pamphlet with the few remarks I have here thrown together, <hi>and ſet in judgment on himſelf,</hi> on the ſame articles.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall boldly and authoritatively, retort the charges of <hi>falſehood,</hi> in every one of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars by him enumerated, pages 33 and 34.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, "the defeat of the Emperor's ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the Netherlands." It is <hi>ſcandalous</hi> to term a prediction <hi>falſe,</hi> becauſe it is <hi>not yet fulfilled. I ſay alſo,</hi> the Emperor's army <hi>will be</hi> defeated in the Netherlands: and if there were no other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſing cauſe for this defeat, an attempt to raiſe the ſiege of Luxembourg, now ſeriouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted, would ſuffice for the purpoſe: and I add, therefore, that he <hi>will</hi> acknowledge the French republic, and <hi>will</hi> make peace with it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Dutch <hi>have acknowledged the</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:028789_0015_0FDD45A3F2982218"/>
French Republic, and <hi>are</hi> making a haſty peace with it. Mr. Brothers never ſaid it would hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen without a conqueſt, or that they would treat on equal terms. For the completion of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, it is enough that they ſhould have acted as <hi>they are acting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Brothers <hi>never ſaid,</hi> our army would be diſbanded and ſent home, <hi>by the twenty-fifth of March:</hi> our author, therefore, ſhould not have incurred the riſk of the retort diſcourteous, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til our army was out of the poſſibility of being ſo treated at all. Nor did he ever aſſert that <hi>the Duke of York</hi> would be detained: he expreſsly ſays, "the <hi>general</hi>" of the Engliſh forces. That is now Count Walmoden: to-morrow it may be ſomebody elſe; but to do away all chance of verification, the ar-ſhould be proved to have no general at all.</p>
            <p>In theſe three little articles, wherein our ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymous author has attempted to fix an imputation of falſehood on Mr. Brothers, he has convicted himſelf of <hi>"preſumption,—ignorance—artifice— and falſehood;</hi> and here I leave him.</p>

            <head>TO PHILIP STEPHENS, <abbr>ESQ</abbr> Admiralty-Office.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>TO avoid the imputation of appearing troubleſome, I waited a conſiderable time after the half-pay was advertiſed, that a very juſt applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, tho' I believe unprecedented, ſhould not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe the Admiralty. Government is in my debt to a much greater amount than twelve months; and altho' I have not enjoyed any emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lument, perquiſite, or profit, from any buſineſs or employment whatever, the only reaſon advanced for detaining my property, is the want of being qualified every ſix months, by ſwearing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of a certificate as the reſult of my own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and inclination, when an order of council commands me, and abſolutely prohibits the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment until I do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:028789_0017_0FDD45A6888DD990"/>A voluntary act is an avowed freedom of choice, and under that denomination cannot, to ſwear juſtly, admit the influence of a compulſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry order; but I am not allowed any choice, ſwear I muſt, and ſwear the oath I take is not enforced by order, compulſion, or neceſſity, but a volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry act of my own, received with equal freedom as the air I breathe as an indemnification for impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing an improper oath, I am obliged by the ſame rule to leave my ſignature duly atteſted by a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate as a record, certainly not of ſuperior wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. To ſwear, then, agreeably to the preſcribed form laid down by the privy council, is obvious to the plaineſt capacity a ſurreptitious oath, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing its deformity under that mild appellation: for I hope no man is ſo far loſt to all ſenſe of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, as to prefer taking an idle oath of this kind, or any other deſcription, when permitted an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the very word voluntarily, to decline it.</p>
            <p>Inſtructed from my infancy to guard againſt falſehood, as the moſt poiſonous evil that can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly invade the human mind, and to court truth as the moſt beautiful of all moral virtues, I view an oath as the moſt awful and ſolemn appeal which a man can poſſibly make: the preſent judges ſay it ſhould be adminiſtered with caution, and never repeated except when preſſing neceſſity requires! for this reaſon, an oath before them is a public bond of true evidence; tear away the ſolemnity by habitual practice, the ſacred barrier falls to the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028789_0018_0FDD45A9CE217268"/>
ground, and every man enters wild and lawleſs on the common of perjury.</p>
            <p>It was the language of Mr. Pitt, in the Houſe of Commons, (I aſk pardon for the introduction of his name) when a clauſe was offered for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain bill late in the laſt ſeſſion, recommending an annual oath, or thereabouts, as neceſſary for the better payment of that part of the revenue it went to deſcribe, his anſwer was, ſuch a multiplication of oaths tended to deſtroy every public principle, promote fraud and perjury, more than any imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate benefit to the Exchequer could poſſibly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate to ſociety. I lament, ſentiments equally diſcerning and honourable do not adorn the heart of every man.</p>
            <p>Having ſerved under three commanders, not leſs amiable in private life than eminently conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous on the liſt of profeſſional merit, their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental precepts, their example of rectitude and manners, remain ſtill as an admoniſhing leſſon of advice never to be departed from. To drink from a foul ſtream, in preference to a clear foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, for no other reaſon than a multitude being conſtantly led by official perſuaſion to do ſo, without once deigning to examine the contaminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reſource it flowed from, or, as a gentleman in the commiſſion of the peace obſerved to me with evident marks of diſpleaſure, what buſineſs have you to object againſt it, when others do it? would be treating every faculty with ingratitude, and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:028789_0019_0FDD45AB09569830"/>
manifeſt an open indifference for the good of knowledge.</p>
            <p>I can paſs by the oath; it is frequently done; the terms are low, ſafe, and practical eaſy; for it is inconſiſtent with common ſenſe to take a voluntary oath as an act of neceſſity; it is a bad doctrine that goes to obliterate the terror of iniquity by habitual repetition, and actually libels the propriety of juſtice; but to be forced in any manner, and ſwear to the contrary! or if the fraud was diſcovered, I believe it would torture the invention of the moſt learned diſquiſitor to frame a proſecution for counterfeiting a forced, unjuſt, nominal, voluntary oath. To me, the evaſion would be diſhonourable, and amount to a crime of equal magnitude as embracing the evil I complain of.</p>
            <p>Profane ſwearing, or any other deſcription of idle oaths, as a paſſport to receive thoſe wages the law, reaſon, and equity, does not allow the detention of, under any pretence, in the moſt uncivilized countries, is forcing a man privately by the moſt cruel of all tortures, to the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of iniquity, without being able to advance even a plauſible reaſon in its defence; for I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, it is not for the prevention of fraud to the revenue, or to prevent that kind of emolument in future, which it goes back to diſcover, neither is it to prohibit an officer from wandering abroad, when liable to be called for at home, but for a
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:028789_0020_0FDD45AE82504CE8"/>
purpoſe which may be gueſſed at—delicacy will not allow me to mention.</p>
            <p>At any rate, as men of more liberal and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent characters now fill the departments of State, than at the period which gave birth to this curious order, the intention it was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced for is now done away, conſequently a continuance of it is entirely unneceſſary: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the remote period of its formation, thoſe who adviſed it, were in ſome degree ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that a public oath could not be impoſed on any part of the community beyond the walls of the council chamber, unleſs ſpecifically intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and authoriſed by act of Parliament, or ſo great a people would never attempt to conceal the imbecility of a meaſure, and fritter away their own power, by retiring behind the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous form of 'this deponent voluntarily makes oath,' when an abſolute order was in force to carry it into execution, or ſtop the payment of wages until it was obeyed.</p>
            <p>If I am to be precluded from all uſe of my property, becauſe I do not implicitly ſwear to error and contradiction, under the vain idea of compulſion being an ample ſhield againſt the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of ſwearing improperly, and that the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity would revert on thoſe who impoſed it, ſuch language is beneath any man that had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to perceive, though not fortitude to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; clothed with the benign hand of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:028789_0021_0FDD45AF79116FA0"/>
with health and ſtrength, neceſſity ſhall never compel me to look for it by any way diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable to myſelf, or repugnant to the niceſt laws of equity.</p>
            <p>If it is true virtue animates the hero, and emulation is meritorious in the youth, if vice is ugly, and falſehood a deformity; as a ſenator, and a man of ſenſe, the good of the Navy, the benefit of your country, call on you to attempt the extirpation of a cuſtom diſhonourable to God, and reproachable to man.</p>

            <p>THE Propheſies and revealed knowledge communicated to the world by Richard Brothers, having generally attracted public notice, I think it my duty to ſtate ſome of them as they have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready fulfilled, and let the world judge of them according to their own knowledge and belief.

Theſe things having been already fulfilled, ought to be a caution to every body how they deny Revelation and Prophecy, and it behoves every perſon to examine into the revealed prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies very carefully, and judge impartially.

            <p>Richard Brothers ſtands in the Court Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as a naval officer, Jan. 3, 1783. Surely then his character and behaviour during his continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the navy are very eaſily to be enquired by thoſe that doubt his ſanity. Becauſe he quotes Scripture and believes in GOD, is too ridiculous, one would think, for any perſon to ſet him down either as an impoſtor or a madman. If he has not wrote thoſe letters to government, as he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, then he is a falſe prophet, and the <hi>onus probandi</hi> lays with the miniſters, &amp;c. If thoſe letters are eſtabliſhed, I think his prophecies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true, abſolutely prove him a true prophet. I have taken every ſtep to detect him in impoſition or madneſs, but cannot in either.</p>
