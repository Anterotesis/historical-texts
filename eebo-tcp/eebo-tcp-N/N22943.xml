            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>WHATEVER may be the reſult of your approaching deliberations, the intereſts of this country cannot fail to have been promoted by many of the diſcuſſions to which <hi>this great occaſion</hi> will have given riſe. The numerous addreſſes to the people at large, to the ſtate legiſlatures, and to yourſelves, will often bring truth and reaſon into the public view, or expoſe to detection the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per meaſures, which paſſion or unworthineſs have induced any of the parties to adopt.</p>
               <p>It is plain, that thoſe, who have neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, at a very late hour, have far the hardeſt taſk, though truth were admitted to be on their ſide, Nothing, which can be prepared, for example, to manifeſt all the errors of "Phocion,"<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Phocion,</hi> after publiſhing about eighteen eſſays <hi>under</hi> that ſignature, in the Gazette of the United States, has republiſhed his papers, <hi>without</hi> the ſignature of Phocion, in a pamphlet, entituled <hi>"The Pretenſions of Thomas Jefferſon to the Preſidency, examined; and the Charges againſt John Adams refuted,"</hi> &amp;c. Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober, 1796. The diviſion, by numbered eſſays, under the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature of Phocion, as firſt publiſhed, is abandoned in the pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet. The <hi>ſecret</hi> reaſons for this change are unknown. No rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is given by the author, nor is there any trace of his firſt form of publication.

It cannot have been meant to cauſe the electors to believe that there were two extenſive publications againſt Mr. Jefferſon. It is however neceſſary, that the electors be apprized that <hi>the number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eſſayiſt, Phocion,</hi> is, <hi>alias,</hi> the anonymous <hi>Pamphleteer.</hi>

                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:030293_0004_0FE5AA7E04659088"/>
The opinions of Mr. Adams in favour of an <hi>he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary</hi> preſident and of an <hi>hereditary</hi> ſenate, and his deſire to ſee them introduced among us, are <hi>the great objections</hi> to him, which prevail concluſively with all the friends of the federal conſtitution, who are oppoſed to his election. Hence we ſee, <hi>that though Mr. Pinckney is underſtood to be ſet up by the ſame perſons,</hi> no objections whatever have been made to him. This gentleman gives riſe to <hi>no alarms</hi> even among the friends of other candidates, becauſe he is univerſally admitted to be <hi>attached to repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or elective government.</hi> Nay, even the papers characterized as anti-federal and jacobin, have not ſounded any alarm concerning <hi>the republican</hi> Pinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
               <p>The friends and enemies of the federal conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have been accuſtomed to believe, that GENE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAL WASHINGTON is a <hi>lover of repreſentative go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> It has been a cauſe of <hi>devout thankfulneſs to Providence,</hi> in the minds of ſerious and anxious men, that <hi>this friend to republics</hi> was in the chair, when the combined powers aſſociated to reſtore mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy in France, in 1791; and particularly in 1793, when the king of Great-Britain iſſued, <hi>within the ſame week</hi> (Oct. 31, and Nov. 6, 1793) a public
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:030293_0005_0FE5AA7FDC1E45D0"/>proclamation <hi>to ſuppreſs republican government in France,</hi> and <hi>ſecret</hi> orders hoſtile to <hi>the reſources and naval organs of our unoffending republic.</hi> Here we might offer complete exculpatory remarks, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſpoſitions, which a concurrence of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances like theſe, might naturally excite in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of ſecretary Jefferſon; indeed we might fully eſtabliſh his <hi>merit</hi> on the occaſion; but it is only neceſſary to our preſent argument to obſerve, that <hi>the friends of our republican conſtitution</hi> felt great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, at a moment ſo awfully eventful, in <hi>the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> that our chief magiſtrate was an indiſputable enemy to every modification of <hi>hereditary</hi> domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If the friends of repreſentative government cheriſhed with thankfulneſs this comfortable truth, what will they now think and feel, if they behold the high preſidential authority in the hands of one, who has no faith, no confidence in repreſentative or elective government, who believes, <hi>with the jealous enemies of our conſtitution abroad,</hi> that a monarchical conſtitution is not only better than our federal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, but that a mixed monarchy is "the <hi>beſt</hi> of <hi>all poſſible</hi> governments." Aſk yourſelves, reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, but highly reſponſible truſtees of a deſerving nation's peace, before it ſhall be too late, can the people of America be hoped to confide in ſuch <hi>a conſtituted authority?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The letters of "Phocion" have been principally confined to the rejection of Mr. Jefferſon. He ſays enough, it is true, to cover himſelf from the charge of neglecting Mr. Adams. Yet he certainly has not taken up and explained any of the paſſages, in favor of hereditary government, which a wiſe and zealous advocate would (if he could) have openly ſeized and refuted. This is a caſe in which the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry horns of the adverſary, if we may uſe the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſhould have been taken hold of with intrepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity. "Phocion," inſtead of reſerving almoſt entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>In treating of the Lacedemonian government, <hi>which was hereditary</hi> in <hi>the kings and ſenators,</hi> in the two hundred and fifty-fifth page of the firſt volume, of the London edition, Mr. Adams writes the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words—</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Lacedemonian republic may then, with great propriety, be called monarchical, and had the three eſſential parts of the beſt poſſible govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; it was a mixture of monarchy, ariſtocracy, and democracy.</q> This paſſage is <hi>unequivocal</hi> and goes to <hi>the whole length</hi> of the <hi>principles</hi> in queſtion. Mr. Adams does not merely ſay, that this mixed monarchy is <hi>not bad</hi>—not merely, that <hi>it is good</hi>— not merely that <hi>it is better than the exiſting conſtitution of Maſſachuſetts or of New-York</hi>—not merely that it is better than <hi>ſuch a conſtitution, as this federal conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, under which a beneficent Creator has placed us, a ſecond choſen people,</hi>—but Mr. Adams, without <hi>any,</hi> the <hi>leaſt,</hi> qualification or reſerve whatſoever, expreſsly ſays, that this Lacedemonian mixture of <hi>monarchy—ariſtocracy</hi>—and democracy, had "the <hi>three eſſential</hi> parts of <hi>the beſt poſſible government.</hi>"<note n="*" place="bottom">Not <hi>our</hi> diviſion of powers, but the three <hi>variant,</hi> different, <hi>oppoſite</hi> eſſences, or eſſential parts, viz. <hi>monarchy,</hi> &amp;c.</note> To frame a declaration of <hi>monarchical</hi> and <hi>ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical faith</hi> more <hi>unequivocal</hi> and <hi>explicit,</hi> all the words of our language, nay, <hi>all the ideas of the human mind,</hi> would be <hi>vainly</hi> applied.</p>

               <p>THE philoſophical talents of Mr. Jefferſon are denied by Phocion, and yet they are repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him as diſqualifications for the office of Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Nothing can more clearly evince the perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Phocion's judgment, which his overween<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prejudices have produced, than that a man of his manifeſt ſenſe and knowledge ſhould have given expreſſion to ſuch an opinion.</p>
               <p>Permit me, gentlemen, to offer a few queſtions to your conſideration.</p>

Was he not <hi>conſtantly</hi> attentive to his duties, as a commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner for patenting diſcoveries, improvements, and learning? Did his philoſophical talents diſqualify him for thoſe duties? Did the board of truſtees of the ſinking fund <hi>ever</hi> ſit without his preſence, when he was at the ſeat of government? Were the duties of the ſcientific <hi>Governor Bowdoin</hi> leſs punctually and firmly performed, in the inſurrectional ſeaſon of 1786, becauſe he, like Jefferſon, was a philoſopher? Did the ſervices of Franklin, as the agent of <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts</hi> in England, or in France, as the <hi>American commiſſioner,</hi> ſuſtain <hi>any</hi> diminution of their effect from philoſophical abſtractions?

<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030293_0008_0FE5AA82F3B76528"/>importuned the philoſopher Franklin to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the executive government, had they not been long taught by his <hi>exemplary</hi> punctuality, how <hi>a love of ſcience</hi> and political duties may be united? Were <hi>Bolingbroke, Addiſon, Cicero,</hi> or <hi>Maecenas,</hi> leſs able politicians, becauſe they cultivated learning or che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed learned men? Did Mr. Jefferſon leſs ably per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the duties of an American miniſter in France, becauſe he has reſcued our unknown country from the miſrepreſentations of Buffon? Would a preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the United States relax with leſs propriety from his public labors, in a philoſophical <hi>library,</hi> than in a theatre, or a ball room? Apologizing for the trouble, which has been given in obviating this prepoſterous objection to Mr. Jefferſon, we may conclude with reminding the electors, that Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick the ſecond, the ſaviour of the <hi>proteſtant</hi> cauſe, the illuſtrious atchiever of military and civil prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, having for the laſt time reviewed the army, which guarded his capital, ſpent the remainder of the day in converſing with the foreign miniſters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident at his court, upon the <hi>philoſophical</hi> experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Spalanzani. The obſervations of Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, ſays the elegant Gillies, marked his <hi>philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal turn of mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was in vain, that Phocion attempted to excite againſt Mr. Jefferſon the diſpleaſure of the friends of the blacks in the city of Philadelphia, becauſe he guardedly "advances a ſuſpicion,"<note n="*" place="bottom">"I advance it, therefore, as <hi>a ſuſpicion only,</hi>" are the words of Mr. Jefferſon. Page 239, London edition.</note> that the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes are inferior, either naturally or factitiouſly, in ſeveral particulars to the white race. It was known in Pennſylvania, that Mr. Jefferſon had propoſed for conſideration an un-adopted article in the declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of independence, cenſuring the kings of Great Britain for annulling the American laws to prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030293_0009_0FE5AA88AC926680"/>the ſlave trade. It was known too, that he had introduced a bill into the legiſlature of Virginia, at their firſt ſeſſion after the declaration of independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and that he had finally carried <hi>the moſt ancient</hi> law of theſe ſtates <hi>aboliſhing that trade,</hi> though not to emancipate the ſlaves here. It is plain to every man who has preſerved a calm judgment on the ſubject, that Mr. Jefferſon's ſentiments in favour of the <hi>unborn poſterity</hi> of the blacks [for that is <hi>all</hi> he mentions] though never acted upon, from proper reaſons, are evidences of his regard for them and for the general liberty of mankind, <hi>ſo much the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> as he may think the blacks inferior to the whites. If he conceives this ill-fated deſcription of men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to ourſelves in the <hi>preſent</hi> powers of their minds, it is ſurely humane, it is ſurely magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous to have thought of propoſing for their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, the elevating condition of political liberty, at a future day.</p>
               <p>Phocion next endeavours to alarm the ſouthern ſtates upon the ſubject of their ſlaves. Mr. Jeffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's ſentiments, ſo far as they were againſt the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities of the blacks, had been juſt <hi>played upon,</hi> in order to deprive him of votes in Philadelphia and its vicinity. And, ſtrange as it may appear in the <hi>ſame</hi> writer, Mr. Jefferſon's dormant ſentiments of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to <hi>the poſterity</hi> of the blacks, were employed to injure him with the ſouthern planters. It was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by Phocion, that the ſtate of Virginia began, in the earlieſt ſtages of the revolution, the abolition of the ſlave buſineſs, and that South Carolina, North Carolina, Maryland, and Delaware, have <hi>all</hi> ſince followed her. Pennſylvania, and all north of her have alſo <hi>followed.</hi> How then could Phocion expect to render Mr. Jefferſon obnoxious by a dormant propoſition, draughted by a committee near twenty years ago, which has ſince been countenanced by all the ſtate legiſlatures, but that of Georgia. To
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030293_0010_0FE5AA5F699E01C8"/>ſpeak in the mildeſt terms, ſuch unguarded <hi>conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> of the <hi>ſame</hi> argument, prove the writer to be under the influence of paſſions ſo bewildering, that the electors cannot ſafely confide in any of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jefferſon</hi> and <hi>Buffon</hi> are divided about the blacks. The latter rather believes them equal to the whites. —Jefferſon <hi>doubts,</hi> but he qualifies all his obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions like a circumſpect philoſopher, and a philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropiſt. His words are (page 239, London edition) <q>I advance it therefore as <hi>a ſuſpicion only,</hi> that the blacks, whether originally a diſtinct race, or <hi>made diſtinct by time and circumſtances,</hi> are inferior to the whites in the endowments both of body and mind. The opinion that they are inferior in the faculties of reaſon and imagination, <hi>muſt be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded with great diffidence.</hi> To juſtify a <hi>general</hi> concluſion, requires <hi>many</hi> obſervations, even where the ſubject may be ſubmitted to the anatomical knife, to optical glaſſes, to analyſis by fire, or by ſolvents. <hi>How much more then</hi> where it is a facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not a ſubſtance, we are examining; where it eludes the reſearch of all the ſenſes; where the conditions of its exiſtence are various, and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly combined; where the effects of thoſe which are preſent or abſent bid defiance to calculation; let me add too, <hi>as a circumſtance of great tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> where our concluſion would degrade <hi>a whole race of men</hi> from the rank <hi>in the ſcale of beings</hi> which <hi>their Creator</hi> may, perhaps, have given them?</q> I challenge Phocion to adduce a ſuperior example of philoſophy, philanthropy, and religion.</p>
               <p>When we conſider <hi>the ameliorated ſtate of man</hi> in the cloſe of this eighteenth century—when we bear in mind the improvements in agriculture, in manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, in commercial operations, in navigation, in coinage and finance, in the ordering and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of the public force, in the fine and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030293_0011_0FE5AA6BE94D70C8"/>arts, in didactic inſtitutions, in ſcience, and in the ſublime theories of <hi>ſocial</hi> and <hi>religious</hi> duties, which diſtinguiſh the preſent generation, we neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily conceive <hi>exalted</hi> ideas of the <hi>progreſſion</hi> and <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities</hi> of the human ſpecies. But when we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how generally the inventions and acquiſitions enumerated, are diffuſed among the <hi>white</hi> nations, and how ſmall a portion of them have been invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or acquired by the <hi>colored</hi> nations, from <hi>the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſtarting time</hi> of univerſal barbariſm to this day of <hi>tranſcendent</hi> illumination, we may, without crime, entertain <hi>"the ſuſpicion"</hi> of Mr. Jefferſon, that the blacks are <hi>at preſent</hi> in a ſtate of actual inferiority, whether natural or factitious.</p>
               <p>Phocion has roundly aſſerted (page 5, lines 7, 8, and 9) that Mr. Jefferſon <q>had once formed the extravagant project of <hi>emancipating all the ſlaves</hi> in Virginia.</q> Such are Phocion's words. That idea, however, is not to be found in Mr. Jefferſon's book, to which Phocion refers as his authority! The whole body of the ſlaves in Virginia, young as well middle-aged and old, were left, by the draught of the propoſition, <hi>as the laws had placed them,</hi> in the hands <hi>of the owners,</hi> and <hi>the unimpaired property</hi> of thoſe owners. It was only the <hi>future</hi> offspring, <hi>the poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of the exiſting ſlaves, which this unreported draught of a propoſition of the legiſlative committee, <hi>in the ſmalleſt degree,</hi> contemplated or included. Not one ſingle perſon, who would be a ſlave, at the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture date of the intended act was to be emancipated. Such children alone <hi>as ſhould be born after</hi> the paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a propoſed law, were to take their <hi>chance</hi> of the propoſition, if it ſhould be offered to the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature. But the propoſition was never offered, for ſerious reaſons. The committee kept it from the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature. It was only hiſtorically related in Mr. Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferſon's <hi>"Notes on Virginia."</hi> The electors will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030293_0012_0FE5AA8A884F55A8"/>with <hi>a judiciary prudence and ſolemnity,</hi> the confidence they are to repoſe in the future teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the ſelf-deceived <hi>Phocion.</hi> For our part, we impute not to him malignity or voluntary miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation. We only affirm him to be <hi>completely blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> by aggravated prejudices.</p>
               <p>In certain paſſages of Phocion's 5th, 6th, and 7th pages, and particularly in the laſt paragraph of his ſixth page, he charges Mr. Jefferſon with the deſign of having the ſlaves <hi>"tranſported"</hi>— "ſhipt off to ſome <hi>other</hi> country"—"ſhipt off, <hi>like a herd of black cattle,</hi> God knows where"—and even with the deſign of having them <q>
                     <hi>ſuddenly ſeized, bound, packed on board veſſels,</hi> and <hi>againſt their conſent, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported</hi> to ſome <hi>leſs friendly</hi> regions, where they would be <hi>all murdered</hi> or <hi>reduced to a more wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtate of ſlavery.</hi>
                  </q> Let a faithful extract from Mr. Jefferſon's book give you thoſe unreported ideas of the committee, of which the tranſported Phocion has twice printed the above ſhocking miſrepreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It ſhould be premiſed, that the legiſlature had appointed Mr. Jefferſon on a committee to reviſe the laws of Virginia, with a ſettled view, among other things, to ſuch amendments as <hi>"republicaniſm"</hi> and conſiſtency required. They were conſcious that a new and ſolemn declaration of <hi>the equal birth-rights of men,</hi> was contained in the act of independence —<hi>the juſtificatory manifeſto of the United States.</hi> This too they conſidered as the cauſe, <hi>at the awful iſſue of arms,</hi> between America and Great-Britain. They viewed it, no doubt, as <hi>the end</hi> for which the ſword had been unſheathed, and as <hi>the cardinal maxim</hi> of that <hi>republicaniſm,</hi> to which they were appointed to conform the Virginia laws. Under theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances they ſketched, <hi>not what the diſtempered ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of Phocion has pictured to himſelf,</hi> but a clauſe for the propoſed bill, which, if adopted, would go, as Mr. Jefferſon ſtates it, <q>to emancipate all ſlaves
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030293_0013_0FE5AA8C161B06F0"/>born <hi>after paſſing the act.</hi> The bill reported by the reviſors (ſays Mr. Jefferſon's Notes) does not itſelf contain this propoſition; but an amendment containing it was prepared, <hi>to be offered</hi> to the legiſlature whenever the bill ſhould be taken up, and further directing, that they ſhould continue with their parents to a certain age, then be brought up, at the public expenſe, <hi>to tillage, arts, or ſciences,</hi> according to their geniuſes, till the females ſhould be 18, and the males ſhould be 21 years of age, when they ſhould be <hi>colonized</hi> to ſuch place as the circumſtances of the time ſhould render moſt proper, ſending them out <hi>with arms, implements of houſehold and of the handicraft arts, ſeeds, pairs of the uſeful domeſtic animals,</hi> &amp;c. to declare them a free and independent people, and extend to them our alliance and <hi>protection,</hi> till they ſhall have acquired ſtrength, and to ſend veſſels at the ſame time to other parts of the world for an equal number of white inhabitants; to induce whom to migrate hither, proper en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements were to be propoſed.</q> In this ſtatement by Mr. Jefferſon, we find no expreſſion or idea like <hi>"tranſportation,"</hi> an odious term bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed by Phocion (it is hoped without deſign) from the penal regulations of another country. Nor do we find any appearance of a deſign to <hi>"ſhip off"</hi> the <hi>poſtnati</hi> children of the colored people to <hi>leſs friendly</hi> regions. But, reſpectable electors, <hi>what</hi> ſhall be thought concerning the motives of Phoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in charging Mr. Jefferſon with the deſign of <q>
                     <hi>ſuddenly ſeizing—binding—packing on board veſſels</hi> —and <hi>againſt their wills, exporting the freed blacks</hi> to ſome leſs <hi>friendly</hi> regions, where they would be <hi>all reduced to a worſe ſlavery</hi> or <hi>murdered?</hi>
                  </q> It is not our duty for ever to defend the well-informed Phocion from the emotions of diſeſteem, which his miſrepreſentations muſt excite in the ſerious minds
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030293_0014_0FE5AA8DEA518AB8"/>of perſons, ſo ſelect, as are the preſidential electors. After they ſhall have in vain ſearched the book of Mr. Jefferſon for <q>
                     <hi>tranſportation,</hi> exportation to leſs friendly regions, ſeizing, binding and pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on board veſſels,</q> and after they ſhall have looked in vain for <hi>a renewed and more bitter ſlavery or a general murder,</hi> in the probable iſſues of the contemplated plan of the committee, they would conſider all apologies as charity miſapplied, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration affected.</p>
               <p>We have already noticed the obligations, reſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from ſlavery in America and Virginia, under which the legiſlature of Virginia, Mr. Jefferſon and his colleagues, all ſeemed to ſtand. That ſtate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably contained at the time 200,000 ſlaves. Theſe could be as well accommodated upon two millions of acres of land, as the white people of many farming counties of Pennſylvania, New Jerſey, New York, and New England now are. The ſtate of Virginia, even after the ceſſion of the north-weſtern territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, contained near ſeventy-eight millions of acres, beſides their remote lands, <hi>then unceded,</hi> beyond the Ohio. To ſome of that remote, but fertile diſtrict, far beyond that weſtern river, in the ſame latitude, <hi>with a more equable climate,</hi> the <hi>poſterity</hi> of the ſlaves might have been <hi>"colonized,"</hi> for that is the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Mr. Jefferſon. It is manifeſt that no <hi>tranſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi> place, requiring them to be "packed in veſſels" and "ſhipt off," could have been neceſſary or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, becauſe Virginia had immenſe tracts of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and fertile lands on which they could have been <hi>"protected."</hi> She had no tranſmarine territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; nor could a ſtate, without a navy, protect them in a tranſmarine ſituation. A ſimilar plan, on a ſmall ſcale, was formerly meditated in Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, and it has many features of that plan, which THE PRESIDENT is now endeavouring to introduce among the Indian tribes. With a humane policy,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030293_0015_0FE5AA062A8EC680"/>he inceſſantly aims to promote among the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can ſavages the purſuit of agriculture and the civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izing arts of peace. While WASHINGTON and JEFFERSON, caſt by the acts of their <hi>progenitors</hi> and by the legiſlators of their <hi>infant</hi> days, into the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of ſlave-holders, are ameliorating the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the colored races of men, let Phocion, unable to conceive the ſublime philoſophy by which they are both actuated, take full poſſeſſion of the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about chair, and dwell upon "<hi>the impaling</hi> of a" fluttering <hi>"butterfly."</hi>

               <p>AN unreſerved declaration of Mr. Adams in favor of monarchy and nobility, was ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to you in the cloſe of my firſt paper. That de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration is predicated upon the Lacedemonian go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment —an <hi>ancient</hi> example. Permit me now to ſubmit to you one equally unequivocal, of <hi>recent</hi> date. In his fifty-fourth letter, page 371, vol. I. Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don edition, Mr. Adams writes the following words:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The improvements to be made in the Engliſh conſtitution, lie <hi>entirely</hi> in the houſe of commons. If county-members were aboliſhed, and repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives proportionally and frequently choſen in
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030293_0016_0FE5AA926A492E18"/>ſmall diſtricts, and if no candidate could be choſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, but an eſtabliſhed, long-ſettled inhabitant of that diſtrict, it would be impoſſible to corrupt the people of England, and <hi>the houſe of commons</hi> might be an immortal guardian of the national liberty. <hi>Inſtead of projects to aboliſh kings and lords,</hi> if the houſe of commons had been attended to, wild wars would not have been engaged in, nor countleſs millions thrown away, <hi>nor would there have remained an imperfection, perhaps, in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh conſtitution!</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are among Mr. Adams's <hi>general concluding</hi> obſervations, at the end of a volume which, though ſince called <hi>"the firſt,"</hi> appears to have been then completed, as a diſtinct and entire work. He is not treating of England, but writing what he calls his <hi>"Concluſion"</hi> of the work. After having review<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the governments of ancient and modern times, (and England among them two hundred pages back) <hi>he again calls up</hi> and <hi>holds faſt to</hi> that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar form, which he thinks perfect in the two heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary branches, and beſt upon the whole. It is not a tranſitory ſally in the career of compoſition. No. —It is <hi>a part of a concluding ſumming up, and defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive judgment</hi> upon <hi>all</hi> he had read, <hi>all</hi> he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>all he had thought.</hi> He decidedly conveys the idea, by the faireſt and moſt direct inference, that it is no fault in the Engliſh conſtitution to have <hi>an hereditary king</hi>—no fault to have <hi>an hereditary nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> —that all which it is poſſible to do to improve the Engliſh conſtitution, "lies <hi>entirely</hi> in the houſe of commons." He diſcountenances all deſires and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to aboliſh the kingly and noble powers, and clearly conveys it as his decided opinion, that if the houſe of commons could only be made a houſe of repreſentatives, the king and the lords would be, not even <hi>"imperfections."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="unknown:030293_0017_0FE5AA947B8401F8"/>
But as theſe unequivocal opinions, predicated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the caſes of an <hi>ancient</hi> and an <hi>exiſting</hi> hereditary monarchy and nobility, are capable of additions of a ſimilar nature, let us aſk of you, as juſt and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient judges, a little more attention to this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant witneſs in the pending cauſe.</p>
               <p>After ſpeaking of the courſe of events, which preceded the eſtabliſhment of the univerſal military deſpotiſm, which prevailed on the continent of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope in 1786, in the twenty-third page of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the firſt volume of the London edition, Mr. Adams warns all thoſe nations <hi>not to adopt repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative government in more than one branch,</hi> even tho' they ſhould proceed <hi>by ſlow and gentle degrees,</hi> and <hi>after diffuſing education</hi> and <hi>informing the public mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He obſerves to the Europeans, that <q>kings, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and people, claimed the government in turn: and after all the turbulence, wars, and revolutions which compoſed the hiſtory of Europe for ſo many ages, we find <hi>ſimple</hi> monarchies <hi>(i. e. by kings alone)</hi> eſtabliſhed every where. Whether the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem will now become ſtationary, and laſt for ever, by means of a few further improvements in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical governments, we know not; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtill further revolutions are to come. The <hi>moſt probable</hi> or rather <hi>the only probable change</hi> is, the introduction of <hi>democratical branches</hi> into thoſe governments. If <hi>the people</hi> ſhould <hi>ever</hi> aim at <hi>more," continues Mr. Adams "they will defeat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;</hi> and indeed if they aim at this, by any other than gentle means, and by gradual advances, by improvements in general education, and inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the public mind.</q> Here Mr. Adams declares to the world, that if the people of Germany, France, Holland, Flanders, &amp;c. ſhould <hi>ever</hi> make a trial of <hi>ſuch a preſident and ſenate as ours,</hi> or <hi>any ſubſtitute whatever, for their emperors, kings, ſtadtholders, and nobles,</hi> they will adopt a kind of government which
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030293_0018_0FE5AA960C7B6770"/>cannot laſt—they will loſe their labor—<hi>"they will defeat themſelves"</hi>—They muſt combine, as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, <hi>hereditary</hi> power with the repreſentative prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. On this occaſion it is important to remark (and the remark appears indeed very important) that this worthy citizen frequently falls into, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcates, the dangerous miſtake, that an accurate and effectual ſeparation of the diſtinct powers of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, involves the indiſpenſable neceſſity of three <hi>"orders"</hi> among the members of the ſociety. The Americans generally aſſerted and practiſed theſe three diviſions of governmental powers, <hi>long before</hi> the commencement of Mr. Adams's work; and to this day there are no <hi>"orders"</hi> among the American people. Mr. Adams muſt believe, as a conſiſtent po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litician, that in adopting <hi>an elective preſident and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> we alſo are "to defeat ourſelves," and in his opinion, yet to return to kings and nobles; or he muſt conſider us as, <hi>in nature,</hi> different from the reſt of men.—After thus <hi>emphatically</hi> giving the world his opinions in favor of the <hi>excellency</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> of an ancient and a modern government, which are both hereditary in two branches, and after holding out to all the nations of Europe—the whole civiliſed world, that no ſtate of individual education, or public illumination, could enable them to adopt and continue an elective chief magiſtrate or an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective ſenate, Mr. Adams proceeds, as far as any American could venture, in raiſing diſconfidence, and in ſuggeſting arguments, even againſt our own conſtitutions, of which his title-page promiſed <hi>"a defence."</hi> He quotes, as the text of his counter-arguments, this aſſertion of <hi>Marchamont Nedham,</hi> an European republican writer. <hi>Nedham,</hi> calmly according with the true ſpirit and nature of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the United States, had written above a century ago, <q>that it is but reaſon, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould ſee, that <hi>none</hi> be intereſted in the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030293_0019_0FE5AA97E32BD090"/>authority, but perſons of their own elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſuch as muſt in a ſhort time, return again into the ſame condition with themſelves.</q> Now, Mr. Adams, in what he calls <hi>defending</hi> the conſtitution of Maſſachuſetts, and our other ſtate conſtitutions, and with the preſent federal conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before him (for this addition to his firſt and ſecond books was publiſhed in 1788, and contains a copy of the exiſting conſtitution of the United States) I ſay, Mr. Adams, with theſe things before him, thus counter argues the truly federal and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox paſſage of <hi>Nedham,</hi> which has been juſt quoted. "The Americans," ſays Mr. Adams, "have agreed with this writer in the ſentiment:" and he then quotes the above words of <hi>Nedham,</hi> as I have juſt tranſcribed them from his defence. But Mr. Adams then proceeds to ſay, <hi>"This hazardous experiment"</hi> (of intereſting none in the ſupreme power, but of their own election) <q>they, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans, have tried; and if elections are ſoberly made, it <hi>may</hi> anſwer very well; but if parties, factions, drunkenneſs, bribes, armies, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium come in, <hi>as they always have done, ſooner or later,</hi> to embroil and decide every thing, the people muſt again have recourſe to conventions, and find a remedy. Neither philoſophy nor po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy has yet diſcovered any other cure, than by prolonging the duration of the firſt magiſtrate and ſenators. The evil may be <hi>leſſened</hi> and <hi>poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned,</hi> by elections for longer periods of years, till they become <hi>for life;</hi> and if this is not found an adequate remedy, there will remain no other but to make them <hi>hereditary.</hi> The delicacy or the dread of unpopularity, that ſhould induce any man to conceal this important <hi>truth</hi> from the full view and contemplation of the people, would be a weakneſs, if not a vice.</q> This paſſage, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030293_0020_0FE5AA9D509B7700"/>with the iſſue of our experiment which Mr. Adams inculcates <hi>by the force of all paſt examples,</hi> throws a perfect light upon his meaning, when he ſays that the people of the European governments "will defeat themſelves" if they aim at <hi>more</hi> than <hi>one branch</hi> in the three diviſions of power. For the evils of a chief magiſtrate and ſenate, that are <hi>elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> that is, which are not hereditary, Mr. Adams ſays, neither philoſophy nor policy has yet diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered any other cure, than by prolonging the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the firſt magiſtrate and ſenators. It may prove that <hi>his cure</hi> is the <hi>greater</hi> evil. <hi>He omits all notice</hi> of the excellent federal plan of ſelecting elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors from the maſs of the nation by <hi>the legiſlatures,</hi> or by <hi>the people. He has conceded nothing</hi> to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting all hot and ambitious young men, of how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever powerful connections, till <hi>thirty,</hi> from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; and till <hi>thirty-five</hi> from the preſidency.<note n="*" place="bottom">A ſenate of members who have been nine years in <hi>private</hi> and <hi>public</hi> buſineſs, and who have paſſed the "hey-day of the "blood," are a ſafer and more natural ariſtocracy than the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh houſe of lords. The ſenate of the United States is ſuperior to the Britiſh ſenate, conſidering <hi>numbers,</hi> and <hi>the means of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic education</hi> in this country. Perhaps it might be ſaid, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>numbers</hi> only.</note> "The evils," ſays he, <q>may be leſſened or poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned by elections for longer terms, or <hi>for life,</hi> and if this is not found an adequate remedy, there will remain <hi>no other,</hi> but to make them <hi>he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary.</hi>
                  </q> But ſurely there does remain the above excellent mode in our federal conſtitution. It is very important to repeat that Mr. Adams pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed this volume in the year 1788, after he was poſſeſſed of the excellent federal conſtitution, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which we now live. It appears plainly that he did not treat our admirable mode of chaſing elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the chief magiſtrate, or that of electing fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral ſenators by the ſtate legiſlatures, as in any wiſe
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030293_0021_0FE598D8959884C8"/>materially better than an election directly by the people, or as meaſures, which would do more than to "diminiſh" or <q>poſtpone the evils of a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary preſident and ſenate.</q> Conceding nothing to theſe invaluable ideas in the federal conſtitution, he paſſes over them to the object of his expectation and of his approbation, <hi>hereditary</hi> chief magiſtrates and ſenators. Seriouſly and perfectly conſcious, that he was leading his countrymen on to <hi>the goal of hereditary power,</hi> Mr. Adams concludes with obſerving, <q>that the delicacy or dread of unpopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, that ſhould induce any man to conceal this important <hi>truth</hi> from the full view and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the people, would be a weakneſs, if not a vice.</q> What Mr. Adams wiſhes to be the iſſue of <hi>our</hi> "hazardous experiment" of <hi>elective</hi> government, cannot be doubted, when we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his unqualified and concluſive ſentences in ſpeaking of the Lacedemonian <hi>hereditary</hi> govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of the Britiſh <hi>hereditary</hi> government, and of all the new governments, which may be produced by reform in Europe. As no man will impute to Mr. Adams a want of candor, it cannot be doubted, that he would declare himſelf not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to continue our preſent repreſentative go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. In the ſame vein of ſapping our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in elective government and of inculcating the expectation and <hi>the inevitable coming</hi> of hereditary government, Mr. Adams has ſpoken in the two hundred and eighty-ſecond page of the third Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don volume. The ſame <hi>Nedham</hi> had obſerved, that <q>
                     <hi>the life of liberty</hi> and <hi>the only remedy againſt ſelf-intereſt,</hi> lies in <hi>the ſucceſſion</hi> of powers and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</q> Although this remark of <hi>Nedham</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly accords with the proviſions of the federal conſtitution, which is printed in the volume, and with all our <hi>defended</hi> American conſtitutions, and though neither <hi>Nedham</hi> nor our federal conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030293_0022_0FE5AAA0D1F050D0"/>mentioned any <hi>ſuch ſhort</hi> terms for our public officers or ſenators, yet Mr. Adams opens his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication with ſuggeſtions concerning mere "<hi>annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> elections," and then proceeds, from this <hi>leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved</hi> term of executive and ſenatorial election, to doubts and arguments of example, and to various alarms and ſuggeſtions <hi>againſt elective</hi> and <hi>in favor of hereditary</hi> governors and ſenators. Let his own words be taken.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>If the life of liberty, and the only remedy againſt ſelf-intereſt, lies in the ſucceſſion of powers and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi>
                  </q> ſays Mr. Adams, thus repeating <hi>Nedham</hi>'s words, <q>the United States of America have taken the moſt effectual meaſures to ſecure that life and that remedy, in eſtabliſhing annual elections of their governors, ſenators, and repreſentatives. This," he continues, "will probably be allowed to be <hi>as perfect</hi> an eſtabliſhment of a ſucceſſion of powers and perſons, <hi>as human laws can make;</hi> but in what manner <hi>annual</hi> elections of gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors and ſenators will operate, remains to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained. It ſhould always be remembered, that this is not the firſt experiment that was ever made in the world, of <hi>elections to great offices of ſtate:</hi> how they have hitherto operated, in <hi>every</hi> great nation, and what has been their <hi>end,</hi> is <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well known.</hi>" "<hi>Mankind,"</hi> ſays Mr. Adams, have <hi>univerſally diſcovered</hi> that <hi>chance</hi> was prefer-able to a corrupt choice, and <hi>have truſted Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence rather than themſelves.</hi> Firſt magiſtrates and ſenators <hi>had better be made hereditary at once,</hi> than that the people ſhould be <hi>univerſally debauched and bribed, go to loggerheads, and fly to arms regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly every year.</hi> Thank heaven! Americans un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand calling conventions; and if the time ſhould come, <hi>as it is VERY poſſible it may,</hi> when <hi>hereditary deſcent</hi> ſhall become a leſs evil than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual fraud and violence, ſuch a convention may
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:030293_0023_0FE5AAA25EC73238"/>ſtill prevent the firſt magiſtrate from becoming abſolute, <hi>as well as hereditary.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It is very true, reſpectable electors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that this is not the firſt experiment ever made in the world, of elections to great offices of ſtate, but it is likewiſe true, that ours are the firſt, that ever were made in <hi>genuine</hi> republican governments of <hi>equal birth-rights</hi> and of <hi>equal repreſentation.</hi> It is alſo true, that the <hi>ſecretion,</hi> if we may ſo ſpeak, <hi>of electors of the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive,</hi> from the maſs of the nation, by the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>legiſlative or popular choice,</hi> and the meeting of <hi>all</hi> the preſidential electors <hi>on the ſame day</hi> in ſixteen <hi>ſeveral</hi> places and boards, which cannot, by reaſon of this <hi>ſeparation,</hi> be controled by <hi>a mob</hi> or <hi>an army,</hi> or inflame one another, have <hi>never</hi> before been tried.

               <p>Similar obſervations may be made in regard to our peculiar mode of electing ſenators.

Let me not be ſuſpected of diſreſpect in obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that Mr. Adams could do no good, by holding up in 1788, when the Maſſachuſetts inſurrection was juſt quelled, any eligibility in <hi>"chance"</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, as he unwarily, though correctly, calls <hi>hereditary</hi> magiſtrates. The argument, in regard to <hi>"mankind truſting Providence rather than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,"</hi> appears to be a kind of religious ſophiſm—a ſuggeſtion, which might rather have been expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from a perſon of a ſuperſtitious imbecility, than from one of a firm and illuminated piety. It is a very bad argument, however, becauſe it proves too much. For, if we are bound by religious duty to truſt Providence rather than ourſelves (reviving the divine rights of civil rulers) in regard to preſidents and ſenators, we muſt beware <hi>of taking our public concerns out of the hands of Providence,</hi> by electing <hi>repreſentatives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is very far indeed from true, that mankind have <hi>univerſally</hi> become ſubject to theſe <hi>"chance"</hi> rulers in conſequence of <hi>their own diſcoveries and preferences</hi> of the ſuperior eligibility of the preſent royal and ariſtocratical families, as Mr. Adams, in ſubſtance, alleges. Is it not rather true, that thoſe imputed vices of popular government, "<hi>violence, corruption,</hi> and <hi>fraud,</hi>" not annual, but <hi>diurnal,</hi> have been more frequently the means by which moſt of the preſent <hi>hereditary</hi> families of Europe have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired all, or much, of their power. When the Pruſſian, Auſtrian, and Ruſſian bayonets gave an <hi>hereditary</hi> ſovereign to the unhappy Poles, a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum of "<hi>corruption, fraud,</hi> and <hi>violence</hi>" was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, which far exceeded the aggregate irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities of all our popular elections, during the whole of our exiſtence as independent ſtates. Nay, <hi>to give an important and ſolemn truth its due weight,</hi> there muſt be a greater degree of <q>corruption, fraud, and violence</q> to maintain, even under

<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030293_0026_0FE5AA6DC7A104A8"/>miniſter, who ſhould have preſented to the king a draught of a proclamation, or other official act, terming that government <hi>"a republic,"</hi> or, <hi>"a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,"</hi> would certainly be expoſed to very ſerious conſequences.

Some writers, who have uſed the word <hi>"republic,"</hi> ſince the reſtoration of the ſecond Charles, have been treated with the moſt acrimonious criticiſm; and the houſe of commons, even on the oppoſition ſide, has been the public theatre of ſarcaſms and denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations againſt <hi>"republics."</hi> The members of the minority itſelf, have repelled the charge of <hi>"repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licaniſm,"</hi> as a damning imputation.

               <p>Mr. Adams perfectly well knows the ſenſe in which the <hi>practical</hi> and <hi>theoretical</hi> politicians of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> and, at leaſt, the <hi>practical</hi> politicians of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, underſtand and uſe the words republican and republic.

In England a publiſhed book, approving of, and perſuading to, a republican form of government, would be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered not only as highly offenſive, but ſeriouſly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable.</p>
               <p>When <hi>our learned and enlightened convention</hi> fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our federal conſtitution, they certainly conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an hereditary limited monarchy, as <hi>no republic.</hi> They meant repreſentative and elective government, and not hereditary government. In this intention truly, and in no other, the people adopted the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. An oppoſite aſſertion would have been <hi>fatal</hi> to the inſtrument itſelf.</p>

It is ſincerely and faithfully in the <hi>repreſentative</hi> and <hi>elective</hi> ſenſe, that the federal conſtitution pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, that it <hi>will</hi> guarantee to every ſtate in the American union, a <hi>republican form of government.</hi> As no ſuch act of guarantee has been <hi>yet</hi> conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or accompliſhed, it is of conſequence to obſerve, that in the 15th page of the American edition, and in the 22d of the London edition, in the preface to volume I. Mr. Adams expreſsly affirms that <q>a limited monarchy, eſpecially when limited by two independent branches, an ariſtocratical and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratical power in the conſtitution, may, <hi>with ſtrict propriety,</hi> be called by that name," viz. a republic.</q> Hence it will clearly follow, that if an attempt ſhould be made, <hi>in future,</hi> to convert the ſeveral ſtates into <hi>hereditary</hi> governments, with kings and nobles, Mr. Adams would deem ſuch a meaſure <hi>"ſtrictly, properly, and in truth"</hi> within the meaning of <hi>the terms</hi> of the conſtitution. In the 34th letter, he exemplifies this general aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, too plainly to be miſunderſtood, by an exiſting favorite example, for he affirms that <q>the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of England is, <hi>in truth, a republic,</hi> and has ever been ſo conſidered by foreigners, and by the moſt learned and enlightened Engliſhmen, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the word <hi>commonwealth</hi> has become unpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular and odious, ſince the unſucceſsful and <hi>inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious</hi> attempts to aboliſh monarchy and ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy between the years 1640 and 1660.</q> (See page 208, London edition.)</p>
               <p>Conſidering how ingenious, bold, and tenacious the poſſeſſors of power often are, we cannot but ſee in thoſe two kindred and connected aſſertions of Mr. Adams, <hi>an ample foundation</hi> for a ſerious, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and fatal verbal ſophiſm, by which the high and ſtrong barrier againſt hereditary power, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in that part of the conſtitution, may be got over, without the trouble of breaking it down.</p>

This thirty-fourth letter merits very particular at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. Mr. Adams begins by ſaying, he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to ſtate the ideas of Sir Thomas Smith, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the mutability of governments. Sir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas had publiſhed, in the remote reign of queen Elizabeth, a book, entitled, " The Commonwealth of England." But after a few lines, which have not the leaſt relation to the promiſed ſtatement of the mutability of governments, Mr. Adams diſmiſſes Smith's work, with theſe words; <q>But as there is nothing remarkable, either in favor of our ſyſtem, or againſt it, I ſhould not have quoted the book in this place, but for the ſake of its title.</q> And Mr. Adams then goes on to ſay, <q>the conſtitution of England is in truth a republic!</q> Here we ſee Mr. Adams <hi>purpoſely</hi> introduces an author's mere title page, though he mentions that his book has nothing in it of any conſequence to his "defence" (<hi>on purpoſe,</hi> it muſt be again ſaid) to have an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of giving a good name, the name of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public,</hi> to his favorite government. Surely Mr. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams cannot expect the world to believe, that the Britiſh conſtitution is either like ours, becauſe it was called <hi>"a commonwealth,"</hi> in the <hi>title</hi> page of an antique book, written two hundred and twenty years before; or, that it is in any degree the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>in ſubſtance,</hi> becauſe that name was then given to it; or, that we ought to conſider <hi>as leſs,</hi> the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe difference between our repreſentative govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and that real and indiſputable compound of ariſtocracy in two-thirds, and of monarchy in one-third, <hi>unmixed with even a virtual repreſentation of the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſtatement of the Britiſh government is forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon us by every volume, by the whole ſcope and ſpirit of Mr. Adams's work. It was wiſhed to avoid the remarks here made, and thoſe in the cloſe of our laſt paper, but it is impoſſible to do juſtice
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:030293_0029_0FE5AAAC85F25E90"/>to this deeply intereſting diſcuſſion, without treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing explicitly of that government, which is erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly held up as <hi>the great exemplar</hi> for America and mankind, as <q>the moſt ſtupendous fabric of human invention</q>—as the political <hi>magnum bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> matured by time upon the tree of knowledge.</p>

A houſe of commons, as it is conſtitution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally denominated, which is <hi>completely independent of the people in a clear and efficient majority,</hi> and is truly <hi>an ariſtocracy of gentry, and of the clients of the lords,</hi> holding its powers on the foundation of landed eſtates, which deſcend as <hi>hereditarily</hi> to a ſingle perſon, as the eſtates of the lords, or as the crown itſelf. There are ſome occaſional exceptions, when great and wealthy <hi>purchaſers,</hi> ſtill clearly of the ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocratical quality, <hi>buy with coin</hi> the <hi>fee-ſimple</hi> of a decayed borough, together with <hi>the appurtenant ſeat</hi> in the houſe of commons, or purchaſe, at the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion market-fairs, the votes which are for ſale. To ſuch a number do this kind of members amount, that the largeſt houſe of commons, which had ever aſſembled before the American war, was returned from places, the majorities of whoſe whole number of electors were no more than five thouſand ſeven hundred and twenty-three, in a kingdom with about eleven millions and an half of inhabitants. If the whole of the voters in thoſe places (both the majority and minority) were eleven thouſand five hundred perſons, they would only be about the two-hundredth part of the adult males! For a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:030293_0030_0FE5AAAE5B1F1998"/>of eleven and an half millions of perſons, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains about two millions three hundred thouſand <hi>males</hi> of lawful age.</p>
               <p>After this review, which is believed to be neither materially incorrect nor uncandid, we may ſafely affirm, that the houſe of commons is <hi>a true and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute ariſtocracy,</hi> principally of <hi>hereditary</hi> wealth, and partly of <hi>pecuniary</hi> riches. Beſides, the ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratic influence of many rich and powerful families, <hi>commands</hi> the ſeats for ſome entire counties, and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides</hi> others.</p>
               <p>It reſults, unanſwerably, as we humbly conceive, that the Britiſh houſe of commons are <hi>not the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the people;</hi> that its powers are wielded by perſons who have <hi>no elective relation to</hi> 199-200th <hi>parts of the freemen of Britain,</hi> but an intereſt as <hi>ariſtocratical</hi> and as <hi>oppoſite,</hi> as that of the lords.</p>
               <p>Is then <q>the conſtitution of England <hi>truly</hi> a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public?</q> Is it preferable to ours? Is that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, which is <hi>hereditary</hi> in two branches, and a fluctuating ariſtocracy in the third, like ours, which is <hi>repreſentative and elective throughout?</hi> If it has preſerved liberty better than the deſpotiſms of the European continent, are we prepared <hi>to abandon for it our federal conſtitution?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is to us the moſt aſtoniſhing of all facts, that becauſe the Britiſh and Americans have made <hi>three diviſions of power,</hi> we ſhould be conſidered as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing governments of <hi>three orders,</hi> like the king, the noble, and unnobled ariſtocracies, which have wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the <hi>unrepreſented</hi> people, <hi>the whole govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Britain.</hi> As well might we repreſent a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtal, reſting upon THREE iron columns, as ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to one ſupported by THREE non-electric pillars. The whole congeniality depends on the <hi>magical</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the monoſyllable THREE. In reaſon, they are <hi>oppoſites.</hi>

               <p>THE ſequel of the thirty-fourth letter of Mr. Adams, remains to be conſidered. We have ſeen that in commenting upon certain <hi>republican</hi> ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of <hi>Marchamont Nedham,</hi> Mr. Adams did by <hi>no means</hi> ſeize the occaſion to panegyrize <hi>repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> or <hi>elective</hi> government. He ſays it <hi>may</hi> anſwer very well, but that it is <hi>a hazardous experiment,</hi> that ſuch experiments have been made before, and are known always to have ended in one way, that is, in monarchy, for that mankind have <hi>"univerſally"</hi> preferred <hi>"chance,"</hi> or hereditary rulers, to ſuch as they have procured by their paſt elective experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Thus, in truth, does Mr. Adams throw clouds over our proſpects under elective govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when diſcourſing upon the opinions of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican</hi> theoriſts. Thus does he abandon <hi>the defence</hi> of the <hi>cardinal</hi> principle of our conſtitutions, and thus, under the cover of a defence of <hi>three diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of power,</hi> does he run into the paths that lead
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:030293_0032_0FE5AA5DDAEE6CA8"/>to the <hi>oppoſite</hi> principle of <hi>hereditary dominion.</hi> This is no tortured miſrepreſentation of the paſſages re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to. We ſhould deſpiſe ourſelves for ſuch treatment of reſpectable men, or of important ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
               <p>But how differently does Mr. Adams conduct his diſcourſes, when he is obſerving upon writers who are not, in the American ſenſe, <hi>republican</hi> authors. He ſtates the ideas of Polybius and Plato, who both contemplated hereditary power, as parts of their ſyſtems. He gives the preciſe conceptions of Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius, in the following deciſive words:— <q>It is cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomary to eſtabliſh three ſorts of governments: <hi>kingly</hi> government, <hi>ariſtocracy,</hi> and <hi>democracy:</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which one may very properly aſk them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they lay theſe down as the only forms of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or, <hi>as the beſt;</hi> for in both caſes they ſeem to be in an error, ſince it is manifeſt, that <hi>the beſt form of government is that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of all three.</hi> This is founded, not only <hi>in reaſon,</hi> but in experience, Lycurgus having ſet the example of this form of government, in the inſtitution of the Lacedemonian common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</q> The electors will remember that this Lacedemonian commonwealth was the very ſame <hi>mixed monarchy</hi> noticed in the cloſe of our firſt paper.</p>
               <p>After having thus briefly and preciſely ſtated the political creed of Polybius, and after giving that of the diffuſive Plato in a more diffuſive manner, Mr. Adams ſays, in his thirty-fourth letter, <q>let us proceed then to make a few obſervations upon the diſcourſes of Plato and Polybius.</q> "Plato," ſays Mr. Adams (page 209, Philadelphia and Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don editions) <q>has ſufficiently aſſerted the honor of the laws, and the neceſſity of proper guardians of them; but has no where delineated the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>orders</hi> of guardians, and the neceſſity of a
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:030293_0033_0FE5AA1087A273D8"/>balance between them: he has, nevertheleſs, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us premiſes, from whence <hi>the abſolute neceſſity of ſuch orders</hi> and equipoiſes may be inferred; he has ſhewn how naturally every ſimple ſpecies of government degenerates.<note n="*" place="bottom">This nobody in America now doubts, and there was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in Pennſylvania, in 1778, a ſociety to overturn its firſt conſtitution, on account of <hi>the unity</hi> of the legiſlature.</note> The ariſtocracy, or ambitious republic, becomes immediately an oligarchy—what ſhall be done to prevent it? Place two guardians of the law to watch the ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocracy; one, in the ſhape of a <hi>king</hi> [not a chief magiſtrate like our preſident] on one ſide of it; another, in the ſhape of a democratical aſſembly, on the other ſide. The ariſtocracy, become an oligarchy, changes into a democracy—how ſhall it be prevented? By giving <hi>the natural ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> in ſociety, its rational and juſt weight, and by giving it a <hi>regal</hi> power to appeal to, againſt <hi>the madneſs of the people.</hi> Democracy becomes a tyranny—how ſhall this be prevented? By giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it an able independent <hi>ally</hi> in an <hi>ariſtocratical</hi> aſſembly, with whom it may unite againſt the unjuſt and illegal deſigns of any one man.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here we ſee that Mr. Adams, having got a <hi>royal</hi> theme to diſcourſe upon, does not run into doubts and prophecies about <hi>hereditary</hi> governments, as he had before done in regard to our <hi>elective</hi> govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Theſe royal governments <hi>muſt</hi> then appear to him <hi>free from all cauſe of doubt.</hi> He does not throw out the ſmalleſt caution or alarm againſt them. But indeed he takes pains to ſhew, that the <hi>regal</hi> and <hi>ariſtocratical</hi> powers are proper and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary checks upon what he calls the madneſs of the people.</p>
               <p>Let us aſk ourſelves, however, where and when ſuch a government has been exhibited. Where
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:030293_0034_0FE5AA12177C0238"/>and when were <hi>a king</hi> and <hi>nobles,</hi> each having a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative on the laws, combined with a <hi>real</hi> repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the people? No where, we affirm, but <hi>in books.</hi> How then can it be thus <hi>decidedly</hi> aſſerted, from unexecuted theories, that the three would work ſo well together, as our excellent government <hi>has</hi> done? For a new government, organized <hi>in a ſtorm,</hi> in a country <hi>half wilderneſs,</hi> placed over <hi>a various people,</hi> in a time of <hi>unexampled and extreme</hi> difficulties, amidſt a <hi>belligerent</hi> and <hi>infuriated</hi> world, having to ſtruggle with <hi>the arrearages of many years,</hi> embarraſſed by <hi>diſputes with two</hi> neighbouring pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and by <hi>Indian wars,</hi> to carry us through, with ſafety and <hi>proſperity,</hi> is <hi>more</hi> than any <hi>mixed monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy ever</hi> accompliſhed.</p>
               <p>Let it be here well remembered, that ours is <hi>the firſt genuine repreſentative government</hi> the world had ſeen in 1789. Human affairs do not appear to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of more ſucceſs and advantages under any form of government, even in the calmeſt times. This ought to operate as the moſt encouraging induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>to perſevere on our preſent ground.</hi> We ought not to <hi>diſcourage</hi> or <hi>alarm</hi> the people, by commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>the moſt dangerous</hi> and <hi>tempting</hi> ſituation to any who <hi>doubt</hi> or <hi>diſbelieve</hi> the practicability of our ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, and who may incline to realize <hi>the favorite theory of their matureſt years,</hi> in <hi>themſelves</hi> and <hi>their deſcendants.</hi>

               <p>WE have taken the liberty to ſubmit to you a ſeries of proofs from Mr. Adams's own writings, of his diſpoſition to <hi>hereditary</hi> power. Since the eſtabliſhment of the federal government, a courſe of eſſays have appeared in our gazettes, under the title of "Diſcourſes upon <hi>Davila,</hi>" the European writer upon the <hi>ancient</hi> revolutions of France. Theſe papers have been generally and publicly aſcribed to Mr. Adams, who reſided, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time of their publication, at the ſeat of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, where they were addreſſed to the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican nation.</p>
               <p>In the fourth number of he "Diſcourſes upon Davila," the writer treats of Mr. Adams's favorite topic, <hi>"Diſtinctions in civil Society."</hi> He firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes ſome queſtions, as from an opponent to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and diſtinctions, in the following words: [Diſcourſe IV.]</p>
               <p>"Is there any thing in birth" <hi>(ſays ſome ſuppoſed republican)</hi> 
                  <q>however illuſtrious or ſplendid, which ſhould make a difference between one man and another? If, from a common anceſtor, the whole human race is deſcended, they are all of the ſame family. How then can they diſtinguiſh families into the more or the leſs ancient? What advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage is there in an illuſtration of an hundred or
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:030293_0036_0FE5AAB79D1D6268"/>thouſand years? Of what avail are all the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, pedigrees, traditions, &amp;c.? But this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage muſt be derived from his father and mother chiefly, if not wholly. Of what importance is it then, in this view, whether the family is twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty generations upon record, or only two?</q> To theſe queſtions from the opponent to hereditary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions and orders, the writer gives, <hi>as from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> this reply:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The mighty ſecret lies in this.—An illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deſcent attracts the notice of mankind. A ſingle drop of <hi>royal</hi> blood, however <hi>illegitimately</hi> ſcattered, will make <hi>any man</hi> or woman <hi>proud</hi> or <hi>vain.</hi> Why? Becauſe, although it excites <hi>the indignation</hi> of <hi>many,</hi> and the envy of more, <hi>it ſtill attracts the attention of the world.</hi>
                  </q> Thus does the writer of the Diſcourſes upon Davila view even the unlawful "ſcatterings" of royal loins.—How in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congenial are theſe ſentiments, with the ſpirit of our <hi>defended</hi> conſtitutions? Again—The author of theſe Diſcourſes next repreſents the manner, in which various nations, have ſeverally eſtabliſhed royalty, nobility, orders, and diſtinctions, and then ſays— <q>
                     <hi>Other nations have united all thoſe inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> [or modes of <hi>royalizing</hi> and <hi>ennobling:</hi>] con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected <hi>lands, offices,</hi> and <hi>families</hi>—made them <hi>all deſcend together,</hi> and <hi>honor, public attention, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,</hi> and <hi>congratulation along with them.</hi> This has been the policy of <hi>Europe:</hi>
                  </q> and, ſays our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, <hi>fully explaining himſelf,</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>it is to this inſtitution which ſhe [Europe] owes her ſuperiority, in war and peace, in legiſlation and commerce, in agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, navigation, arts, ſciences, and manufactures, to Aſia and Africa.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Reſpectable electors, we entreat you to read once more this bold and explicit aſſertion of the writer of the Diſcourſes. To what does it amount? No leſs, than that the <hi>hereditary union and deſcent</hi> of
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:030293_0037_0FE598DA2832FC30"/>landed eſtates, legiſlative and executive power and rank in the families of emperors, kings, and nobles, unbalanced as we have ſhewn by even a <hi>virtual</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the people, have producced all <hi>the civilization exiſting among mankind—all the ſublime ameliorations of the human character</hi>—Neither the powerful and continual influences of tonic climates, nor the divine power of the Chriſtian religion itſelf, according to our author, have had any effect in giving energy or dignity to man. It amounts alſo to an explicit declaration, that the conſtitution and government of our country muſt have the moſt <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriorating</hi> influence upon the devoted Americans, unleſs we haſten to make our preſident and ſenate <hi>hereditary,</hi> to give large portions of landed eſtate and power and rank to them, and to ſuch elder children as they may <hi>"chance"</hi> to have, <q>truſting Providence rather than ourſelves,</q> after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the happy Germans, Ruſſians, and Poles, over whoſe favored countries enlightening monarchs reign.—But, to be ſerious, permit us to offer for your conſideration and compariſon, the ſituation of America, as it ſtood on the adoption of <hi>repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> government, twenty years ago, and at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent day; and ſuffer us then to aſk your calm de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, whether the American people are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior at this time to thoſe of 1776, in the various arts of peace—in military knowledge and practice— in legiſlation, both <hi>conſtitutional</hi> and ordinary—in commerce and navigation—in agricultural ſkill and induſtry—in manufactures and the uſeful arts, and in the whole circle of the ſciences?</p>
               <p>The twelfth number of the Diſcourſes upon <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vila,</hi> contains but a dozen lines of proſe. The reſt is made up of poetical extracts from one whom the writer compliments, as "<hi>the</hi> Great Maſter of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture," and as "a great teacher of morality and politics."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="unknown:030293_0038_0FE5AA13A5627710"/>
The following paſſage, extracted from our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's poetical ſelections, at once proves his own conſiſtency, and ſhews that he admires the writer of the poetry for <hi>the politics</hi> he teaches:
<q>
                     <l>— "Oh when <hi>degree</hi> is ſhak'd,</l>
                     <l>"Which is the <hi>ladder</hi> to <hi>all high deſigns,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>"The enterprize is <hi>ſick!</hi> how could communities,</l>
                     <l>"Degrees in ſchools, and brotherhoods in cities,</l>
                     <l>"The <hi>primogeniture</hi> and <hi>due of birth,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>"Prerogative of age, <hi>crowns, ſceptres,</hi> laurels,</l>
                     <l>"But by <hi>degree,</hi> ſtand in <hi>authentic place?</hi>"</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Poetry</hi> does not afford an example of more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>declamation</hi> in favor of <hi>monarchy.</hi> But the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors are aware that <hi>poetry</hi> is the region of <hi>fiction</hi> and <hi>fancy</hi>—not of <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>reaſon.</hi> We truſt it will require more <hi>ſober proſe,</hi> than can be written in the eighteenth century, to perſuade the people of the United States to abandon the principles of our ſtate and federal conſtitutions.</p>
               <p>By ſome accident the thirteenth number of the Diſcourſes is alſo marked as the twelfth. In that paper our author explicitly propoſes, that <q>it ſhall be left to the contemplation of <hi>our</hi> ſtate phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, to diſcover the cauſes and the remedy of that <hi>fever,</hi> whereof <hi>our</hi> power is <hi>ſick.</hi> One queſtion only <hi>[ſays he]</hi> ſhall be <hi>reſpectfully inſinuated:</hi> whether <hi>equal laws,</hi> the reſult only of a balanced government, can <hi>ever</hi> be <hi>obtained</hi> and <hi>preſerved</hi> without <hi>ſome ſigns or other of diſtinction, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</hi>
                  </q> The author requires no commentator on the paſſage juſt quoted. He ſays immediately after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, <q>We are told that our friends, the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Aſſembly of France, have aboliſhed all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions. <hi>But be not deceived,</hi> my dear country-men <hi>impoſſibilities cannot be performed! &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> Have the French officers who ſerved in America, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

Our author in the fourteenth Diſcourſe reiterates <hi>to France,</hi> who had begun her revolution, what Mr. Adams had ſaid to Europe in general, when he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed them only to aim at one branch, deriving its power from the people, and to preſerve their kings and nobles. "The national aſſembly of France," ſays he, <q>is <hi>too enlightened</hi> a body, to overlook the enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, What effect on the moral character of the nation would be produced, by deſtroying, <hi>if that were poſſible,</hi> all attention to <hi>families,</hi> and ſetting all the paſſions on the purſuit of gain. Whether <hi>univerſal venality,</hi> and <hi>an incorrigible corruption in elections,</hi> would not be the <hi>neceſſary</hi> conſequence.</q> [But even the election of the two thirds has not been deemed <hi>venal</hi>] "It may be relied on, however," ſays our author, <q>that <hi>the intentions of that auguſt and magnanimous aſſembly, are miſunderſtod and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſented.</hi> Time will develope their deſigns, will ſhew them to be <hi>more judicious</hi> than to attempt <hi>impoſſibilities ſo obvious,</hi> as that of the abolition of all diſtinctions.</q> Yet our own nation and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment acknowledge none. <hi>George Waſhington</hi> has not made a worſe preſident, becauſe he was plainly called ſo, by our <hi>firſt</hi> legiſlature.</p>
               <p>We ſhall give one more aſſertion of the author of the Diſcourſes, which is round indeed, and fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains the writer's meaning.

               <p>IT has been remarked by ſome, that Mr. Adams's book was written in 1786, or 1787, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he could not mean to object to our <hi>preſent</hi> conſtitution. It is true that the preface of the firſt volume is dated in January 1787, but it is a fact that the third volume was publiſhed <hi>after</hi> he was poſſeſſed of the federal conſtitution, which is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to that volume; and that it contains, as we have ſhewn, ſome of the paſſages, which are moſt oppoſed to that inſtrument in principle. The Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes upon Davila, too, are the moſt forcible cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborations of this oppoſition, and upon the ſtrong
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:030293_0041_0FE5AA1D2043C018"/>preſumption, that they are the work of Mr. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams, they amount to <hi>an active unfriendlineſs</hi> to the <hi>eſſential</hi> and <hi>cardinal</hi> principle of all our conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, both of the ſtates and of the union. They tend, at this time to invite the interpoſition of the foreign monarchies in our affairs, however different were certainly the views, with which they were written.</p>
               <p>It has been alſo obſerved that Mr. Adams's book was written before his two elections, and yet that the people had confided in him as vice-preſident. It is, however, true, that the third volume, being pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in London in 1788, could not be for ſale in the American book-ſtores before the meaſures were taken for the firſt election. But what is much more important, and is abſolutely true, the books were not <hi>read,</hi> much leſs <hi>ſtudied</hi> in America; for books in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to diſplay great hiſtorical events and relating to the principles of government, are not to be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſed, like a ſummer's tale—an amuſing fable for an Auguſt day. By the writer of theſe papers the ſecond and third volumes had never been ſeen, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſo far as their outſides in the library of ſome other perſon. And though the firſt volume had been actually purchaſed, from ſentiments of reſpect to Mr. Adams's character and ſtation, it is a truth, that other vocations and other books had occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it never to be either ſtudied or peruſed. Its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and principles were not known till within a year or two laſt paſt, when <hi>other</hi> circumſtances, <hi>of the nature of the book,</hi> rendered Mr. Adams's work an object of attention to many. Phocion ſays he has ſeen much of America and its inhabitants, and that he has never heard a wiſh for any other form of government than a republic. The ſpecimens he has given of re-ſtatements, even of the <hi>written</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and deſires of others, cannot inſpire the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors with confidence in his accuracy, in regard to
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:030293_0042_0FE5AA740E7DBF50"/>what may have been orally delivered before him. He too, like Mr. Adams, may conſider a limited monarchy as properly a republic, and he may deem a wiſh for a conſtitution like that of Great Britain, to be only a deſire of having another "form" of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public, which Mr. Adams unequivocally aſſerts the conſtitution of England <hi>in truth</hi> to be. It is our unſhaken opinion, that the eſtabliſhment of the bank of the United States was very much to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired— that neither this nor any other civilized na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can avoid the uſe of the exciſe mode of revenue, ſooner or later—that <hi>the funding</hi> of public debts, which cannot be paid off when due, is as much a matter of ſimple <hi>juſtice,</hi> of <hi>prudence,</hi> and of <hi>natural</hi> courſe, as the giving of a common bond and ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it by mortgage, for a private debt—that the check given to Mr. Genet, by the executive, was perfectly juſtifiable and neceſſary, and, in ſhort, that many acts for which this government has been blamed, were ſubjects of <hi>merited</hi> approbation. But with theſe ſentiments, it is a ſolemn truth, that we have felt ſerious anxieties at the <hi>exiſtence</hi> and <hi>growth</hi> of the anti-conſtitutional doctrine of <hi>hereditary</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>which we have actually perceived.</hi> We have been explicit, in regard to this ſubject, on account of the declaration of Phocion, that he has heard no wiſhes for any but republican government—We <hi>know</hi> them to exiſt, and we wiſh it were only in common minds, and in perſons of little influence. It is <hi>the true cauſe</hi> of the preſent reſpectful addreſs to the underſtandings and patriotiſm of the electors.</p>
               <p>It is particulary neceſſary to remark, that there have been <hi>ſeveral</hi> partial and general editions of Mr. Adams's work. The firſt volume was publiſhed in Philadelphia, by Hall and Sellers, and the whole three volumes were printed in London. Other edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have been printed, it is believed in the Eaſtern ſtates. The ſize of the paper, types, and paging, have
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:030293_0043_0FE5AA75DFE9D490"/>differed more or leſs. The preface in the Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia duodecimo copy, occupies ſeventeen pages, but in the London edition it covers twenty-ſix pages.— Sometimes it appears, that the preface is meant to be referred to by writers in the gazettes, when, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they expreſs themſelves ſo, that the reader ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes it is the main body of the work. No volume is numbered on the back, as <hi>the firſt,</hi> becauſe, when the firſt volume was publiſhed in Europe and in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, it is manifeſt that the author delivered it to the world as an entire work, without any intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of publiſhing a ſecond and third volume. The main body of the work, in this firſt volume, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in a little more than 389 pages in the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia copy, and occupies 392 pages in the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don edition. Theſe remarks upon the different <hi>edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and <hi>pagings,</hi> and upon the <hi>preface</hi> and <hi>the main work,</hi> are recommended to particular attention, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they will obviate ſome diſſatisfaction which has been excited by the idea of deſigned miſquotations. Two examples will be given. Time does not admit of ſtating more. A writer from Henrico, in Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, animadverts with feeling, upon ſome opponent of Mr. Adams, for quoting a paſſage, as from the 8th page of his work, and ſays, he has read that page, and can find no ſuch ſentence in it, as was given by the writer he is oppoſing. Now it is found, on examination, that the paſſage referred to is, ſubſtantially, in the <hi>ſeventh</hi> page of Hall and Sellers's Philadelphia edition, and in the <hi>ninth</hi> page of the London edition. It is not in the eighth page of either of thoſe editions, ſo that the quoter muſt have had another copy. But further, it is in <hi>the preface,</hi> and not in <hi>the main body</hi> of the work. The paſſage is material, and is fairly given to the world as Mr. Adams wrote it.—That gentleman had men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>"monarchy"</hi> in the cloſe of the preceding paragraph, and then gave the following words, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the word monarchy, which is now put into a
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:030293_0044_0FE5AA1EB56EB218"/>parentheſis, and not in Italics, for the ſake of ſtrict accuracy.—</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>The objection to theſe governments</hi> (monarchy) <hi>is not becauſe they are ſupported by nobles and a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bordination of ranks: for all governments, even the moſt democratical, are ſupported by a ſubordination of offices, and ranks too.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>So, again, in the 22d page of the London <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,</hi> and in the 15th of the preface of Hall and Sellers's edition, it is ſaid, that <hi>a limited monarchy</hi> may, with ſtrict propriety, be called <hi>a republic.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe obſervations and examples will be ſufficient to explain this <hi>neceſſary</hi> point.</p>

               <p>COLLATERAL circumſtances are often pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful corroboratives of direct evidence. It is therefore of conſequence to ſtate, that an accident has recently brought under view a paſſage in one of the papers, written with every apparent exertion againſt Mr. Jefferſon, in 1792, juſt before the laſt election of a preſident, when it was uncertain whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>General Waſhington</hi> would ſerve again. The writer, though an explicit and induſtrious opponent of Mr. Jefferſon, admits that Mr. Adams entertains what he <hi>ingeniouſly</hi> calls <q>
                     <hi>ſpeculative</hi> doubts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the probable ſucceſs of the republican theory.</q>
                  <hi>Practical</hi> politicians always aim to <hi>real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ize</hi> their mental <hi>ſpeculations.</hi> That paper was the firſt of a ſeries of eſſays, publiſhed under the ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:030293_0045_0FE5AA776DFFB9F0"/>of <hi>Catullus,</hi> in the Gazette of the United States. Who was the writer of Catullus, does not appear, but it is certain that the letters of Phocion (ſince publiſhed in a pamphlet, October, 1796, without that ſignature) contain entire paſſages of the eſſays of Catullus, <hi>without the uſual inverted commas</hi> ["] or <hi>any other marks of quotation.</hi> The preſumption, that Phocion and Catullus are the ſame perſon or perſons, appears to be perfectly fair and irreſiſtible. —There is no eſſential difference (except on a point we ſhall mention) between the entire contents of Catullus, and an <hi>equal quantity</hi> of the eſſays of Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. Matters, ſubſequent to the publications of Catullus, are found, it is true, in Phocion and in the pamphlet made up of what was firſt given in the gazettes, under that ſignature. They contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict each other <hi>only</hi> as to Mr. Adams. Catullus admits that Mr. Adams may doubt the probable ſucceſs of the <hi>republican</hi> theory. Phocion and the pamphlet <hi>declaim</hi> a little about Mr. Adams's repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licaniſm, and then quote a few paſſages, which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tend to render his books ſomething leſs impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, but ſo far as they go, alſo render them abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and palpably <hi>inconſiſtent.</hi> But the eſſays of Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion (and the reviſed pamphlet-copy of part of his eſſays) do not explain away any of the hereditary paſſages of Mr. Adams's books, nor do they anſwer the ſerious matters from thoſe books, and from the Diſcourſes on Davila, which have been reſpectfully ſubmitted to you. Phocion, whoever he may be, is a man of pretty <hi>ready</hi> talents, and he does not want zeal, time, or induſtry, for he has already publiſhed twenty-four long eſſays. Whether he <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi> ſatisfactorily explain Mr. Adams, and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail the evidences of the <hi>monarchical</hi> and <hi>ariſtocrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> principles of that gentleman, or whether he is <hi>unwilling</hi> to do ſo from <hi>a ſimilarity of principles,</hi> or from ſome other views, are queſtions before the electors and the world.</p>

            <p>IT is very plain, that time does not admit of the preſent ſubmiſſion of any further ſtrictures upon the miſtakes or miſrepreſentations of <hi>Phocion,</hi> or of the pamphlet of ſixty-four pages [called in the end, THE FIRST PART] in which moſt of Phocion's eſſays have been reprinted <hi>without</hi> that ſignature or name, and without any appearance of the original diviſion into a numbered ſeries of newſpaper eſſays. If time did admit, we truſt that we ſhould be perfectly able to give unanſwerable evidences of that prejudiced, not to ſay, deceptive manner of treating other parts of Mr. Jefferſon's character and conduct, which we truſt we have proved in regard to the ſubjects of our ſecond number. We could alſo greatly reinforce the numerous evidences, poſitive and preſumptive, by which we have ſupported our aſſertion, that Mr. Adams really cheriſhes expectations, hopes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires for <hi>hereditary</hi> power in the United States, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>the deſign</hi> and to the <hi>proviſions</hi> of our fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſtitution, contrary to <hi>the earneſt wiſhes</hi> and <hi>fixed determination</hi> of the American people, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their <hi>internal peace,</hi> their <hi>true intereſts,</hi> and their <hi>equal birth-rights.</hi>
