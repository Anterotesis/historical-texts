         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>IT</hi> may not be amiss in the first place to mention a little of the Character of the Rev. Mr. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as given us by a person intimately acquainted with him.
"My ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance (saith he) with Mr. Mason I have esteemed one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test mercies I ever Received. His Learning and piety were great, and his humility deep. His affections were so fervent, and his zeal so great, that as they were the comfort so they were the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on of those that feared God, and lived near him. So great was his love to Christ, that he had a value for any one who spoke a Savory word of him. And as he had a great charity for others, so he was most highly esteemed by the different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations of Christi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ns. The frame of his spirit was so heavenly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:034061_0003_0FFA71FF2C776C40"/>
so humble and obliging, his discourse of spiritual things (and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle else could we hear from him) so weighty, with such apt words and delightful air that it charmed all that had any spiritual Relish, and at the same time was not so burdensome to others, as discourses of that nature have been from other writers."</p>
            <p>What a happy time would the Church of God experience, if all its members stood in the same place with this truly pious Christian. Instead of contending about forms and specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we could all unite in the humble charitable, and pious temper with which this good man was so eminently distinguished. The pravalence of such a spirit and temper, is more to be wished for, by every good Christian, than any of those things about which we gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally spend our warmest zeal. If we are Zealous, let us (as he did) turn the heat of our zeal against sin,
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:034061_0004_0FFA720109FCABD0"/>
and for the necessary and undesputed interest of vital holiness, and then it will not be so apt to blind and mislead us. If we cannot all be of the same sentiments let us be all of, and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by one spirit—But this is a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness rather to be desired than expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, till some Divine power, more gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally correct our tempers, and give the human mind a better disposition; or till God shall tune the heart of every Christian to the harmony of his own Divine feelings—O! when shall we cease to strive about the chaff while we neglect the wheat; when shall we cease to build with hay, wood and stubble, which God will destroy by the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his coming?</p>
            <p>But to return. The Author of these remains had an excellent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>talent in the sententious way; he loved to deliver a thought in as few and expressive words as might be, as appears from these his religious maxims and
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:034061_0005_0FFA7203C1B0BD40"/>
sentences, the reader is here presented with; many of them are easy and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, most of them strong and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and all of them devout and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</p>
            <p>If such kind of religious sayings as those of Mr Mason, were but as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to us as our common proverbs; and if parents would but take the pains to insinuate them into, and fix them in the tender minds of their children, I am satisfied it would answer a very valuable purpose in the religious life.</p>
            <p>The serious advice to youth, as it is a plain and affectionate persuasive and directory to the religious conduct, I hope it may be of service, not only to those to whom it is immediately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress'd, but to all who sincerely desire to maintain a conscientious walk with God.</p>
            <p>The directions and signs, &amp;c. may be useful to doubting and discourag'd christians; and to all who make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:034061_0006_0FFA7206F72EC138"/>
of the great duty of self-exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination, and desire to know the true habit and state of their souls.</p>
            <p>Mr. Mason was very happy in his epistolary stile and talents; and if the common maxim may be credited, that a man's true turn and genius may best be known by his letters; these which are here inserted will abundantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the character I have given of this excellent man, in most of which we meet with the same genuine zeal, and unaffected fervour, which animates the rest of these select remains.</p>
            <p>The devout christian loves to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imated and impressed with a strong sense of divine things. And in most of these devotional maxims the reader will find such a life and vigour, that he cannot read them considerately, without find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself not only seriously but warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected; often yielding to the force of them.</p>
            <p>The whole of this collection is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:034061_0007_0FFA720967739430"/>
intended for the benefit of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate families, and for those christians who desire to have their hearts warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a sense of religion (the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of which every true christian often feels, and of the want of which he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten complains) and who are not well able to purchase larger treatises. And if, by the blessing of Almighty God, it may be subservient to the cause of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al religion, and promote a Spirit of true piety, inward as well as outward holiness, I shall have the satisfaction of having been of some service to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; the reflection of which will be ever sweet on my memory.</p>

                  <p>To be low is the safest and comliest posture for sinful creatures.</p>
                  <p>It is the creature's honor to abase himself before the most high God.</p>
                  <p>God had rather see his children hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for sin, than proud of grace.</p>
                  <p>If men did but know themselves more, they would be more humble.</p>

                  <p>To humble ourselves, is the only way to rise.</p>
                  <p>Believers must be humble for sin par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and because it is pardoned.</p>

                  <p>Neither all the devils in hell, nor all the temptations of the world, can hurt that man that keeps himself humble and depending on Christ.</p>
                  <p>It is no humiliation to aggravate sin above Christ's saving power.</p>

                  <p n="2">II. Consider, that by nature you are dead in trespasses and sin; a child of wrath, a stranger, and enemy to God; and while such, the thoughts of God are terrible to you; you can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect nothing from him but wrath and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

heart, and a holy life will follow upon it; but if you strive only against out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acts of sin, while your heart is let alone, your labor will be in vain, your heart will tire you out; or if it doth not, yet remember, that God's eye is in the heart, and he hath provided a hell for hypocrites.

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. Consider, that Christ alone is your way to God. Justification, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and acceptance with God, is by faith in him alone. Sanctification, and a new nature, is by the power of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Consider your life is but short, and altogether uncertain. To defer one day may be to our everlasting undoing. When your life is once gone it will be in vain to think of repenting. You shall then have no more sermons, no more offers of Christ and grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> ix.27. God will be patient no more. And if God should take away your life to morrow, you would perish inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sably for refusing his grace to day. One offer of grace refus'd renders a sinner inexcusable, though God should never offer his mercy more. O, trifle not with your soul! be not careless of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal happiness. You have heaven and hell, life and death before you, and it depends upon your own hearty choice which shall be your portion: And they are chosen by the choice of the way which leads to them. Chuse life, and chuse it speedily. And remember once

again, that you have but one life to chuse in. Trifle not away this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon which depends eternity: Mispend not your short time to your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal loss.</p>
                  <p>Stand not upon a short labor; diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, self-denial, or suffering, for your eternal happiness. God would have you saved; Christ hath died for you to reconcile you to God; he is ascended into heaven to open the door for your soul to enter in at, and he is interced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Father for all grace and mercy for you, if you refuse him not.

ever present cordials. The trouble and pains of religion shall be but short, and your reward shall be glorious and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. Remember that of the Apostle, when religion calls you to self-denial and sufferings, <hi>Our light afflictions that are but for a moment shall work out for us a far more exceding and eternal weight of glory,</hi> 2 Cor. iv.17. <hi>if we suffer with Christ we shall also reign with him,</hi> 2 Tim. ii.12. <hi>and the sufferings of this present life are not worthy to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the glory which shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,</hi> Rom. viii.18. see also, Isa. xliii.2, 3, <hi>when thou passeth through the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire thou shalt not be burnt, neither shall the flame kindle upon thee. For I am the Lord thy God, the holy one of</hi> Israel <hi>thy Saviour.</hi> Never are we more joyful than when we deny our joy for Christ's sake! and if these arguments will not prevail, then consider, that all the pains and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of religion will be found in the end far more tolerable than hell.</p>

good God, and your loving Saviour. The first fruits are to be offered to him. The green ears of your youth are to be carried to his sanctuary. Think it not pity that the vain delights and sinful pleasures of youth should be lost: You shall but exchange them for spiritual delights, which are far more excellent, inward and lasting. The joy of the Holy Ghost, the rejoicing of a good conscience, communion with God, the sense of his love, and the hope of heaven, are far better than the pleasures of sin, and will more than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence your loss of youthful and carnal delights. And consider this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously, that none have usually more comfort in their souls than those, who are willing to lose their sinful comforts for God and their soul's sake.</p>
                  <p>Remember that you must give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to God how you spend your youth, as well as for old age. Consid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as young as you are, how many years are already spent; and what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count you are able to give to God of them. One day spent in sin is too much; and the sins of one hour deserve

a hell. Younger than you, are dead and gone. Let the thoughts of them mind you seriously of your account. Your call to God's bar may be next. Are you ready? Think often what expence of time may be best accounted for to God; and so spend your younger days, as you will wish you had spent them when you come to die and be judged.</p>
                  <p>Suppose God should call you away suddenly, what sentence could you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from him? Are you ready, if the bridegroom should now come? <hi>Matth.</hi> xxv.6. It will be no excuse at judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if you be found in your sins, to say, <hi>Lord, I was but young.</hi> He that is old enough to sin is old enough for hell. You cannot make sure of God's love, and an interest in Christ too soon. You cannot secure your soul too soon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>Consider those young ones in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture who are commended for their ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly piety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Samuel</hi> was ministring to God in his childhood, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> ii.18. <hi>Iosiah</hi> had a tender heart for God in his tender years, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> xxii.19. <hi>Children</hi> sang hosannas to Christ. <hi>Matth.</hi> xxi.15. <hi>Timothy</hi> was a saint betimes, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>
                     <pb n="73" facs="unknown:034061_0080_0FFA72BF14AD51D8"/>
iii.15. And let these young ones be your pattern.</p>
                  <p>The young disciple was the beloved disciple. God takes great delight in an early convert. All your life is due to God, let him therefore have all that still remains, and beg his pardon that any of it hath been denyed.</p>
                  <p>Repentance is easiest in youth. Sin is less rooted, satan not so fortifyed, grace not so much frighted, the Spirit not so much grieved, and the conscience not so much hardened.</p>
                  <p>Be sure therefore to give God your youth. Resolve now to be seriously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions. Now beg for the pardon of your sins, and the spirit of holiness; and though the generality of youth take another course, yet be not swayed by the multitude, and carried down the stream towards hell; let them go, you shall have better company. The saints of God will love you, the angels of God will guard you, and the presence of God himself shall be with you.</p>
                  <p>And if you find yourself still inclined to be as the most are, and to do as the most do, consider that you cannot have
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:034061_0081_0FFA72C191A51AE8"/>
that pleasure in sin which others may. You have had a good education, and good instructions; your conscience hath been more awakened, and will not suffer you to enjoy the pleasures of sin, as others, who are more igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and worse educated, may. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science will mix gall with your honey; when you go to prayer, in the evening, upon your bed, when alone and reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or in the dark, it will read sad lectures to you, and make you review your past delights with bitterness.</p>
                  <p>Labor therefore to approve yourself to God in youth; and though others may condemn you, yet God (from whose mouth only you must live or die) will acquit and justify you.</p>
                  <p>And as a conclusion of this advice, let me persuade you to consider, that forsaking sin, when you are most ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of pleasure or honor by it, and turning to God when your most capable of enjoying the world, will clearly ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence the truth of your conversion. So that a timely conversion to God in youth, as it is most easy, so it is least questionable; for it now appears that
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:034061_0082_0FFA72C405B2D108"/>
God is loved for himself, and Christ is preferred above the flesh, and grace above the sweetest delights in the world</p>

                  <p>THE great command and duty of the gospel, is, to make self no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and God all in point of wisdom, strength, righteousness and glory.</p>
                  <p>And by these things examine all you do: By whose rule have I acted? By whose strength have I acted? In whose name have I acted? And for whose glory have I acted? What faith, what humility, what self-denial, what love of God and Christ, hath there been in all my actions?</p>
                  <p>Endeavour to make every day the Lord's, to spend it well, and to get nearer heaven by it.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. As soon as ever you awake in the morning, lift up your heart to God, and open it to him. As much as possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly you can, avoid all thoughts about

For you will find by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience that, if the world gives your soul the first salute, and be embraced with kindness in your morning affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it will greatly deaden your heart in the morning duties.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As soon as you are up present your desires to God, in the name of Christ, for whatever your soul feels the want of, and give God his due praises for his mercies towards you the night past. Thus <hi>David, Psal.</hi> v.3. <hi>My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O Lord; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee.</hi> And for thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, Psal. xcii.1, 2. <hi>It is a good thing to give thanks unto thee, O Lord— to shew forth thy loving kindness in the morning.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. Let no day go without reading some portion of the scriptures: And it is no great matter, whether you read it before you pray in the morning, or just after; your own inclination and experience will direct you; but be sure it be done.

                  <p>The scripture discovers sin, and the devil's devices and malice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it discovers duty, and the love of God and Christ; and it discovers your strength and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements: There are the promises of assisting and crowning grace. By these, the spirit acts, the devil is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, and the soul is comforted. Through these, the eye of faith can see the love of Christ, the grace of God, and the glory of heaven. In these are the food, the physic, and the arms of the christian's soul. These are the word of reconciliation, grace and truth, and the power of God to salvation: Therefore every day look into these, praying for the spirit's teachings, and mixing faith with what you read.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Let all your ordinary or worldly business of the day be done with integ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of heart, and a respect to God, whose servant you ought to be in all

                  <p>OUTWARD good things are no sign of God's special Love. The sun of prosperity shines upon the bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the wilderness, as well as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the flowers of the garden; and the snow of affliction falls upon the garden as well as upon the wilderness.</p>
                  <p>What though the streams of creature comforts run low with thee, so that thou hast the more from the spring-head? There is more comfort in one drop that distils immediately from God, than from ten thousand rivers that flow from creature delights.</p>
                  <p>God doth sometimes on purpose shew us the creatures emptiness, that we may go to his fulness. He makes us see the creatures to be broken cisterns, that we may know him to be the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: And that we may feed more
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:034061_0088_0FFA72D2F0AC6360"/>
largely upon spiritual dainties, he does deny us carnal ones.</p>
                  <p>What though God deny thee the earthly jewel, if he gives thee the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly crown?—If thou hast no por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here thou shalt have a kingdom hereafter; and God is thy portion here, and so long thou shalt not want any good thing. Creature comforts at the best, are only delightful, not satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; pleasant, not gainful!</p>
                  <p>What if all thy friends forsake thee, so long as God (who is better than all) stands by thee?—Whatever enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment friends afford, that God does much more. Do they love thee? He died for thee. Do they pity thee in thine afflictions? In all <hi>thy afflictions he is afflicted,</hi> Isa. lxiii.9 —What wouldest thou have a friend for? For converse? O! taste and see how good and pleasant a thing it is to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God! Hear (if thou canst, and not be ravished) the sweet voice, <hi>I am thine, and thou art mine.</hi> O! feel the pantings of his heart, and hear the soundings of his bowels!—Wouldst

thou have a friend to pour out thy breast into? —O! who is so fit for that as God? He will bear part of thy burden if thou art laden, or he will add new strength to sustain it.—His love, his converse, his society, is life itself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and such a life as is made up of nothing but sweetness and delight.</p>

                  <p>I REJOICE in God, who hath call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you into the fellowship of his Son, our Lord Jesus Christ; and into that grace, wherein you stand. Let us remember, that we are, by nature,
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:034061_0128_0FFA715A71D5B0C0"/>
children of wrath, even as others. We might have been cast into hell long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go. Were we not provoking sinners? O how did the Lord call upon us, and we regarded him not?—But did the Lord stand and knock, and call till he made us answer, <hi>speak, Lord, for thy servants hear?</hi> Did he give us ears to hear? Would he not let us alone, till he had won our hearts?—O blessed be his name! We might have been blasphemers, persecutors, haters, and despisers of that which is good, at this day. We might have counted the life of religion madness; praying, and professing of religion, fancy and solly. We might have been left to ourselves; all our hope might have been in this life; all our comfort in this world; all our confidence in creatures; and all our heaven upon earth: Hath the Lord caused us to know better things? O let us admire his free grace, now and for ever.!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My friends,</hi> consider how great things the Lord hath done for you. Call to mind your former experience, and live as those whom the Lord hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:034061_0129_0FFA715F4ABBD550"/>
by his blood. Now you must look upon yourselves as the Lord Christ's, and not your own. Consid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>from</hi> what you are called, and <hi>to</hi> what you are called.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Would you live holily, observe these rules.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Live in the eye of God. 2. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the example of Christ. 3. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the fruit and end of things. The fruit of sin is shame and sorrow. Sin is a viper in the end: But the fruit of righteousness is peace; holiness is eternal life, in the end.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Bind the commandments upon your hearts. 5. Shun the appearances, and the least beginnings of sin. 6. Be frequent and fervent in secret prayer.</p>
                  <p>My friends, <hi>would you live comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, take these directions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Live not so much upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of God, as upon the God of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. Be afraid of unbelief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is a great sin. Do not greaten your sins above God's saving power. Believe in the word, firmly and constantly. Trust
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:034061_0130_0FFA7160EDE5F448"/>
perfectly to the grace and mercy of God in Christ. <hi>I will trust in the mercy of God</hi> (saith <hi>David) for ever and ever,</hi> Psal. lii.8. 2. Beware of sin, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of wilful sin: That will bring a cloud, and make a breach between God and your soul. 3. <hi>Do not mind earthly things.</hi> O take heed of unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful affections; of an unlawful carriage of the heart; about lawful things. 4. Examine the ways of your heart daily: Search yourselves. <hi>What sin have I committed? What duty have I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this day?</hi> Every night look back upon the thoughts and affections, and speeches of the day past. Confess your failings over the head of the <hi>Scape-Goat.</hi> This is another necessary means to keep your peace with God, and to walk comfortably before him: And I pray observe it. 5. Examine your heart farther, and consider the gracious actings and workings of God's blessed Spirit within you; what good thoughts, what good desires, aims, resolutions, God hath put into you. Consider what out-goings of your heart, after God, there have been, what incomes, and
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:034061_0131_0FFA71640C4B0C88"/>
influences of his grace. Daily exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine your hearts for these things, and give God the glory of all the gracious workings of his spirit in your soul. 6. If you would walk comfortably with God, mind not what is forged, but what is written. Heed not every fancy the devil may dart into you (for then you lie at the mercy of your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my) but keep close to the written word of God. <hi>Thus it is written,</hi> said our Saviour to satan the tempter.—So much for comfortable walking.</p>
                  <p>Dear friends; <hi>Would you walk peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and charitably, take these rules.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Remember God hath called you to peace. 2. Remember when Christ was reviled, <hi>he reviled not again.</hi> 3. If others neglect their duty to you, yet do you not neglect your duty to God, nor to them. Let not another's sin cause you to sin: To render railing for railing, is to return sin for sin 4. You must shew your love to God, whom you have not seen, by your love to your brother, whom you see daily.
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:034061_0132_0FFA7165B8FC5930"/>
Shew your piety by your charity. 5. Consider that an unbridled tongue is a sign of an unsanctified heart. They that have not a dram of grace to tame their tongues, shall one day want a drop of water to cool the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r tongues. 6. Do good to others, if they do not thank you for it. The less reward you have on earth, the greater shall your reward be in heaven: As the less wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the servant takes up within his year, the more comes in at the year's end.</p>
                  <p>Dear friends; <hi>Would you be constant in good ways and purposes, take these di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Remember you have engaged yourselves to God, and therefore you must keep yourselves from idols. You have given up your names to God, and you must give up your hearts to God. You have made a covenant with God by sacraments. If satan or the world are suiters for your hearts, tell them, <hi>you are already disposed of; you are pre-engaged to God; you have chosen your
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:034061_0133_0FFA7169033AE780"/>
God, and you must not think of changing him.</hi> 2. Consider whither would you go from Christ? Where do you think to find such another God as your God; such another friend as Jesus Christ? 3 Remember, if it be good to draw near to God, it is better to draw nearer to him: Still the nearer the better. One may see an end of earthly perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but there is no end of the perfect<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ion of Jesus Christ. 4. Be downright for God; and you shall find soul-hearting comfort in God, that shall keep you close to God. 5. Walk humbly with God; that is the way to walk closely with God. If a christian is humble, he is a christian indeed: God will not suffer such a one to be tempted above his strength. 6. Let not opinions swim in your heads; that will make you fall: But let the great things of religion sink into your hearts, and that will make you stand. Be content, yea, willing to suffer for Christ; who did so contentedly and willingly suffer for you. And if you suffer with him, you shall be glorified together.</p>
                  <p>Now, <hi>my dear friends,</hi> the Lord be
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:034061_0134_0FFA716B72995E80"/>

                  <p>THOUGH providence hath sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated us, yet it refresheth me to think upon you, and that I am interest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in your prayers as you are in mine. Well, if we are met in Christ, we shall meet upon the bench in the great day of assize, and before a throne of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in our Father's kingdom. In the mean while, our God is with us both whilst we are with him. In his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence is <hi>fulness of joy.</hi> It is not so much the change of place, as the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God,</hi> which makes heaven. <hi>There</hi> is heaven where God shines and
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:034061_0142_0FFA717BC25D87A0"/>
manifests himself. When a soul can say, <hi>I would not go to heaven, if it were not to meet God there; and if I should be cast into the flames of hell, I could not find in my heart to blaspheme God;</hi> the exercise of such a meditation will great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly help her against temptations.</p>
                  <p>Many a good soul doth not know how much she loves God; but when she feels that affection stirring within her.—O then, she is in a new, serene, comfortable frame! Satan flies. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect love casts out fear. Love God, and praise God,</hi> and all is at peace. Nay, admit the soul hath not got full assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of her pardon; yet if she sets down this resolution—<hi>Let God be glorified whatever become of me. Let the angels praise him; let the saint praise him; let the</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi> Gentiles <hi>be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in to praise him; and if it may please his divine majesty, let my poor unworthy soul please him, and be a praise to his grace for ever and ever</hi>: if it can say this, it must be happy with it. That must needs be a happy soul that breathes forth th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> praises of God, ascribes all glory to God, and can sing,

                  <p>The Lord put and keep your heart in a praising frame. O how well doth this angelical and evangelical disposition befit and become those, who of sinners are made saints; of enemies, children; of slaves, heirs; of burning brands, shining stars! When we consider seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously what we have been, and what we <hi>might</hi> have been, nay, what we <hi>must</hi> have been, if infinite mercy had not prevented; (as the Lord, was seen in the mount, when <hi>Isaac</hi> day bound up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the alter, mercy came in between the knife and the sacrifice) instead of scourged, how nobly pardoned &amp; promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted! raised from devils to angels com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from the lowest depth to the greatest height; this (I say) if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider it, is matter of admiration, not of expression. If we had as many tongues as we have veins or drops of blood, they could never utter a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandth part of the due praises of <hi>divine grace. Let us now magnify the Lord and exalt his name together.</hi> O the
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:034061_0144_0FFA71816AA82A80"/>
height, and breadth, and depth, and length, of the Father's love! O the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and unsearchable riches of free grace! O! the tremendous mystery, &amp; invaluable mercy of the incarnation the Son of God! O the stupendous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation and condescention of eternal glory and omnipotency! O the unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allel'd love of a dying Saviour! O the sweet heavenly communion of the blessed comforter!—Lord, what do these things mean?—Lord, what are we? or what is our father's house, that thou hast brought us hitherto? That thou shouldst make thy self glorious in our glory, who had made ourselves vile in dishonoring thy name?—O, let us give him our whole souls, who hath redeemed them by his blood! For it is fit he should have the utmost of so dear a purchase. Farewell, my dearest friend in the Lord, in whom I am, <hi>Your, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>I Received yours, and should be glad to hear where, and in what condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you now are. Want of jealousy and zeal for the great name of God, deserves to be complained of. I am glad it is your burden; nevertheless I would not have you be discouraged. It is a sound conclusion of divines, <hi>That a christian may be more sensibly affected with outwar things, which touch the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, than with spiritual things; and yet have a more inward, deep, and hearty

concern for spirituals.</hi> He may have a more radicated love to God, than to any earthly things; he may have a more judicious hatred of sin than of any plague; he may have a more solid, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found grief for the dishonor of God, than for an injury done to his earthly relations; albeit he may be under more vehement passions, and may shed more tears for wrongs done to his friends, or for plagues inflicted upon his body, than he doth from spiritual evils. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, I am glad Almighty God hath so far enlightened your mind, to see so much of the evil of sin as to be displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with yourself for being no more displeased at it. It is some argument of softness, when the stone grates upon the flesh, and makes it bleed. To be sensible of hardness argues that hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness doth not prevail.—God go on with his work in your heart, and make all graces abound in you. Wait con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually upon your God. <hi>Seek the Lord, seek his strength, seek his face evêrmore.

                  <p>I THANK you for your letter. God hath blessed me with a son; and we are all in good health, God be praised. My brother <hi>Wyat</hi> was sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly taken away, and my sister is left a poor sorrowful widow. See the course and fashion of the world; first the birth of a son, then the death of a brother. God never changes, never dies. Happy are they that have God for their God?

<pb n="159" facs="unknown:034061_0166_0FFA71B802F074E8"/>
yet talking of God, and of the things of God, from the heart, is part of the christian practice, especially among those that are endued with a sense of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. <hi>Our words must be savoury, seasoned with salt; tending to edification; and such as may minister grace to the hearers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I commend to you secret duties. <hi>A christian is what he is between God and his own soul.</hi> Go to God for God; go not from God without God: Seek his face in Christ. Endeavour for a sense of his favor, and the supply of his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. You have the blessed and most worthy name of Christ to speed your requests; therefore let nothing lie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your heart to trouble you. It is not only a suffering but a sin, to let any thing lie upon our heart to trouble us, when we have a God that bids us <hi>cast all our care upon him.</hi> God will deal familiarly with you; he will be all things to you, if you depend upon him. If your spirit flags or faints, search the cause of this untowardness and averseness, and conclude it is not well with you till you have recovered
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:034061_0167_0FFA71BA71461AF0"/>
a cheerful, obedient frame of heart, that you can say from your soul, <hi>Lord, whom have I in heaven but thee? Whom have I in earth but thee?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Two things resolve upon by the grace of God, <hi>viz. To judge yourself; and to judge no body else.</hi> God requires these two things, <hi>to be severe towards yourself; and charitable towards others.</hi> This will bring you comfort. Attend to the vitals and essentials of religion; they will nourish the life and power of Godliness in your heart.</p>
                  <p>Three things make a christian, <hi>viz. Repentance towards God; faith in our Lord Iesus Christ; and sincere and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal obedience.</hi> Mind these three things, and the God of peace shall be with you.— Assure yourself, there is such a thing as religion in the world, though some deride it, and others fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pretend to it. There is such a thing as communion with God.—Seek comfort in God through Christ, there it is to be found; rest not till you have found it and then your soul will say. <hi>This is that I would have; this satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies and refreshes.</hi> If a man hath his
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:034061_0168_0FFA71BCF2FAA4D8"/>
chest full of treasure, what cares he though he be called a poor man; he hugs himself, and saith, <hi>Populus me si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilat, at mihi plaudo.</hi> So if a man be judged a hypocrite it matters not, so long as he hath the evidence of his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in his bosom; a testimony with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that he hath pleased God.—In a great house there are grooms and scullions, yet we say, it is not their house, it is such a nobleman's house, he owns it; so there is not a christian in the world but hath vile slaves lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within him, but Christ is the <hi>Lord of the house.</hi> Corruption rebels, but grace reigns, There are two houses, two parties, Christ's side and the dev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>il's; and a conflict between them. If it were not so; if it were not for this inward conflict, earth would be heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en; for outware opposition would be nothing, if it were not for this inward Corruption. Well but <hi>Quod non placet, id non nocet. If sin be our grief and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred it shall not be our ruin.</hi> Christ's side shall prevail.</p>

                  <p>IT is the duty of every true christian to give God the glory of his grace. We can never bless God enough for his patience, that hath kept us so long out of hell; nor for his mercy, that so earnestly invites us to heaven.

God for any token of his love; any portion of his spirit. Thou canst not say, thy sins are forgiven thee; but canst thou not say, they are confessed; they are confessed over the head of the <hi>Scape-goat</hi>? Dost thou heartily confess thy sins unto God, with all their aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations? O! it is a great mercy.— Thou canst not say, thou hast an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in Christ; but hath not Christ an interest in thee? Hath he not won thine heart and affections? O! it is a great mercy.— Thou sayst possibly, I am not worthy to be called a child of God. But doth not God receive and treat thee as a father? The prodigal (<hi>Luke</hi> xv.) acknowledged he was not worthy to be called the son; but yet his Father received him.— Again, it may be thou complainest of sin; but is it with thee as it was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly? Shouldest thou not bless God for some amendments? If a sick man be any thing bettered in health (though he still be very bad, yet) he will tell his friends, he is somewhat better than he was, and he blesses God for it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, tho' sin dwells in thee, yet, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,

it is the grief of thy soul: Thou art its captive not its convert. As sin is against thy soul, so is not thy soul a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst sin? If it be thy grief it shall not be thy ruin.</p>
                  <p>Again 'it may be thine heart is troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in an hour of temptation but hast thou not sometimes enjoyed sweet peace with God? Were not thine earthly delights vain? Canst thou not say now, <hi>O quam sauve est istis sauvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatibus carere? One quarter of an hour's communion with God is worth all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in the world?</hi> Canst thou not call to mind some of God's former lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-kindnesses? Hast thou not some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times tasted and seen how good the Lord is?—What a mercy is that! —Again, thou art not assured of heaven, and thou wantest an assurance thereof. But thou hast such hopes of heaven as thou wouldest not exchange for all the kingdoms of the world; and shouldest thou not bless God for that? Which is more to thee than all the world?—Again, thou sinest thro' mistake or passion. But canst thou find in thine heart to sin against God?

But is there not some life in thee? Deadness stands in opposition to liveliness as well as life. If thou art dead, that is, not lively, yet bless God that thou art not quite dead in trespasses and sins.—Again, it may be that thou complainest of a hard heart. But thy heart is not so hard but it feels its hardness. Did <hi>Pharaoh</hi> complain of the plague of a hard heart? He felt it not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he was all stone. But if thy heart feels its hardness, 'tis a sign there is something of flesh.

But art thou not willing to wait upon him, and to wait for him? Dost thou wait under his table for crumbs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Dost thou wait at his gate for mercy?

out of frame, or of an uneven tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; sometimes praying, sometimes sinning, &amp;c. But though thou art not always the same, yet God is, and Jesus Christ is; and therefore it is that we are not consumed.—Again, it may be thou thinkest thou shalt never be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to suffer for Christ, thy weak na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture shrinks and trembles at the thot's of it; thou art afraid thou shalt rath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er deny thy Saviour, than thy name, thy liberty, or thy life. It is true, if thou shouldest be left to thyself, it would be so; but God is faithful, and he will not suffer thee to be tempted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove what thou art able to bear. He will not send thee into a wood to fell an oak with a penknife. When he calls thee to the work thou never didst, he will give thee the strength thou nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hadst—Again, it may be, thou fearest thou shalt fall away, and never hold out to the end, but doth not this fear of thine rather secure thee than betray thee?

The Lord carry on his work effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in your heart. If thou hast grace, thou hast a great charge about thee: Satan and his instruments will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to rob thee of it, but they shall not prevail. <hi>Our life is hid with Christ in God; and when Christ who is our life shall appear, we shall appear with him in glory.</hi> Only let us watch and pray that we do not enter into tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.

Pray constantly and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently. Wait upon God continually. Abhor the appearance of evil, my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and dear friend.—The Lord keep you through his name, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his loving-kindness towards you.

Blessed be God who hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served you, and followed you with the motions of his good spirit. The Lord carry on his work in our hearts, that we may at last meet in his kingdom. Be encouraged still to depend on God. Converse with him by faith, medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and prayer. If any despise the

God's work is wages, and <hi>in keeping his commandments there is great reward.</hi> Go on (my dear and faithful friend) go on in the strength of God. Follow after righteousness, holiness, faith, love, patience, meekness. Labor farther after measures of grace, &amp; more intimate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and communion with God. <hi>The way of the Lord is strength to the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</hi> The farther a man walks in the good ways of God, the better he will find them. Let us live by faith, till we shall live by sight. Let us breathe by prayer, till we breathe out our souls into Christ's bosom. —Say, we are weak, (as it is most true;) our God will strengthen us. A christian cannot keep himself but he is kept by the power of God, through faith unto salvation.—Therefore we must commit our souls to God's keeping, and derive supplies of strength from Jesus Christ. O that we might daily receive of his fulness, even grace for grace! When satan tempts, or the world tempts, fly to Christ, and he

                  <p>I commend you to Christ in my prayers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I commend Christ to you in my letters, Christ is all in all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because I live (saith he) ye shall live also.
