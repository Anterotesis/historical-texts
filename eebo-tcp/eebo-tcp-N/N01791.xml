            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>CONSIDERING the curious Workmanſhip of God, in the Regularity, comely Proportion and mutual Uſefulneſs of all things, in their Original Frame &amp; Contexture; and how all kinds of Creatures did ſerve in their ſeveral Places, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their ſeveral Capacities, to ſhew forth the Glory of Him who gave them their Being, Beauty and Activity; 'tis a wonderful and abaſing Conſideration, to every Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002123_0004_0FBC1F55DCF8C750"/>
&amp; Serious Soul, that there is now no more Stability and Decency, eſpecially in humane Proceedings. But that Darkneſs, Diſorder, Sin and Death, have thus Invaded, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run the World. Indeed the World has ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Miſerable Overthrow and Ship wreck; but it is a ſtrange as ſad, that nothing will reduce the Children of Men, to that Love &amp; Obedience to their Maker which was Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally founded in their Natures.</p>
            <p>When the Lord appeared in his Greatneſs on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> it look't as if men would be afraid to be <hi>bad Iſraelites</hi>; and in His Graciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on Mount-<hi>Sion,</hi> as if men would be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to be <hi>ſtrict Chriſtians</hi>: but thus it is, Scarcely any thing leſs than <hi>Heaven,</hi> will make the Saint Serious; or any thing leſs than <hi>Hell,</hi> will make the Sinner Silent. There is and will be Sin in the beſt of Saints; and Sinners in the beſt Regulated Societies &amp; Churches.</p>
            <p>Indeed the Apoſtolick was a truly Golden Age; yet in the Churches of Chriſt there was Droſs as well as pure Gold; there were Infirm Saints, &amp; bold Sinners Hypocrites &amp; Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, as well as Sound and Sincere Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle mentioned in the beginning of this Book, ſpent great part of his Miniſtry among the ſeven Churches of the <hi>leſſer Asia</hi>;
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002123_0005_0FBC1F576AA2BFC8"/>
and moſt of them were grown Corrupt &amp; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, when he wrote to them from the Iſle, where he was Confined, for the Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>This Book in General Contains many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Viſions; and in them a ſolemn repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the preſent and ſucceeding State of the Church of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>This Epiſtle is particularly directed to the Seven Principal Churches of this <hi>Leſſer Aſia,</hi> and the three Firſt Chapters altho' they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly mention theſe Churches and no others, yet (the number Seven in Scripture Signifying a compleat thing) they Indifferently reſpect the Univerſal, under ſuch like circumſtances.</p>
            <p>In the firſt part of this Chapter, the Apoſtle directs himſelf to the Church in <hi>Sardis,</hi> in the Perſon of the Angel or Overſeer of it. Where we have.</p>
            <p n="1">I. A Deſcription of its State. That altho' it had a <hi>Name to Live,</hi> yet <hi>was really Dead,</hi> or at lesſt <hi>ready to Die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. A Remedy preſcribed againſt the Diſeaſe, under which it Laboured. <hi>Be Watchful, &amp;c. Remember therefore, how thou haſt received, and heard, and hold faſt and repent:</hi> To return to their firſt ſtate, &amp; have recourſe to the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive inſtitution, &amp; form of Doctrine delivered to them by the Apoſtles &amp; Apoſtolical men.
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002123_0006_0FBC1F5A73277198"/>
Doubtleſs <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Rule borrowed from hence, is very ſafe &amp; may be depended upon, viz. <hi>Quicquid primum Illud verum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. A Threatning denounced in caſe of neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect <hi>If therefore thou ſhalt not watch, I will come upon thee as a Thief. v.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A Commendation given to ſome who had kept themſelves from thoſe Corruptions, which prevail'd among the reſt: together with due Incouragement given to all to return to God. <hi>v.</hi> 4. &amp; 5.</p>
            <p>What I would take notice of in the Words read; is a diſcovery of the Unſound (or a General Deſcription of the) Condition of the once Gloriou Church of Chriſt in <hi>Sardis.</hi> And it is put in mind,</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>What it was in Name.</hi> Or what it ſeem'd to be. <hi>Thou haſt a Name that thou liveſt.</hi> It not only retained its Name of Chriſtian Church, and made a Publick Profeſſion of the only true Religion in the World, but was Favoured with agreeable Advantages; and ſo might be yet very conſiderable, in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſuch as took notice of the outſide, or ſhew, but not of the Power of Religion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>When it was in Reality: And art Dead.</hi> Not Abſolutely, but Comparatively; for there were a few names in <hi>Sardis</hi> that had not Defiled their Garments. Altho the general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002123_0007_0FBC1F5CA3DD32B8"/>
were gone off from God, yet there were ſome few that cleaved to him. As for reſt altho'they might retain ſomewhat of the form of Godlineſs, yet had in a great Meaſure loſt that good Spirit, which had before Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced them, and kept them alive. So that they were now Dead. Or as ſaid in the next Verſe, <hi>ready to Die.</hi> What ever the World thought' of them, or they of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; altho their Profeſſion might be high, and their Advantages conſiderable, yet they were evidently and certainly Languiſhing.</p>
            <p>Hence the Truth which offers it ſelf to us; &amp; may be Inſiſted on at this time is this, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That a People may, &amp; ſometimes have a Name to Live; and yet are really in a Dying Condition.</p>
            <p>A Man may eſteem himſelf, &amp; be look't up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by others as having a healthy &amp; firm Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; when ſome fatal Diſeaſe has Seiſed him in a Vital Part. A Man may nave the Advantage of a fair Eſtate, and yet be really Poor. And not only a Perſon, but a People may ſeem to be ſomething, when they are nothing. The Church of the <hi>Laodiceans</hi> ſaid it was <hi>Rich &amp; increaſed in Goods,</hi> and had <hi>need of nothing.</hi> And yet was <hi>Wretched, &amp; Miſerable, &amp; Poor, &amp; Blind, &amp; Naked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:002123_0008_0FBC1F5E356C54A0"/>And if we look back to <hi>Iſrael</hi> of Old we ſhall find, that there was no Nation upon Earth ſo Favoured; that had ſuch a Name and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges: <hi>God did lead his people like a Flock, by the hand of Moſes &amp; Aaron.</hi> Pſal. 77. ult. <hi>Moſes</hi> was as a King in the Army; and <hi>Aaron</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtered in things that were Typical &amp; Sacred: <hi>Moſes</hi> brought their cauſes before GOD; and <hi>Aaron</hi> Offered their Sacrifices to God, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> had Laws, Statutes, Judgments and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances accordingly: Yet were they a <hi>Proud, Stiff-necked, Murmuring, Unbelieving, Ugrateful &amp; Idolatrous People</hi>; And did Backſlide from God, with a perpetual Backſliding.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Iſrael</hi> indeed did ſometimes revive a little; when God raiſed up ſome Eminent Reformers of poured out his Wrath upon them in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible manner. Yet their returnings to God were Ordinarily Hypocritical, or Partial, or of no long continuance: For indeed the Body of them were rotten at the Heart, and their Wound Incurable.</p>
            <p>In Speaking to the Truth before us, I ſhall Conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">I. When a People may be ſaid to have a Name to Live.</p>
            <p n="2">II. When they may be ſaid to be in Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Condition. And,</p>
            <p n="3">III. What makes ſuch a People thus De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline and Languiſh.</p>
            <p n="1">

And at this time we ſhall rather inſiſt on the Privileges &amp; Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which a People Enjoy, than upon the meer Profeſſion &amp; ſhew which they make.</p>
            <p>So then People may be ſaid to have a Name to Live, on the account,</p>
            <p n="1">(I.) Of their <hi>Civil.</hi> (2.) Of their <hi>Sacred Intereſts</hi> and Advantages.</p>

Or in a Word whatſoever is neceſſary to Furniſh men throughly to every good Thought and Affection, Word and Action. Alſo when a People have God himſelf nigh them, ready to hear their Crys, to Correct their Errors, to Supply their Wants, and to give His Holy Spirit to them that ask Him. Moreover when a People have Gods Miniſters, who Labour to Convince their Conſciences, to ſtir their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections &amp; Inclinations; eſpecially in things that relate to Faith, Repentance and New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Obedience;

            <p>Now altho' a People ſo Favoured, may be Languiſhing and Dying with reſpect to their Spirit and Practice, in things truly amiable; yet theſe things put them under great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of moving, toward the Unity of the Faith, &amp; of the Knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect Man, unto the meaſure of the Stature of the fulneſs of Chriſt, as the Apoſtle expreſſeth it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.I3.</p>
            <p>We may ſay concerning ſuch a People, as <hi>Moſes</hi> concerning Iſrael, — <hi>That the natios which ſhall hear all theſe ſtatutes, and ſay, Surely this great nation is a wiſe &amp; underſtanding people.

            <p n="1">I. When they are going from, their firſt Eſtate: are paſt their Flouriſhing Years. All things have their turns of Goodlineſs &amp; Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Vegetables, and all kinds of Living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have their Springing &amp; Increaſing Seaſon: For God <hi>hath made every thing Beautiful in His time.</hi> Eccl. 3.II. Yet as there is a <hi>Time to be Born,</hi> ſo likewiſe is there a <hi>Time to Die.</hi> And as there is a time with Common-Wealths, Churches, Towns, particular Families, &amp; Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, when all things look like a riſing Sun, &amp; Spring Morning; ſo it ſometimes happens that there is a Change in the Countenance &amp; Complexion of all theſe things. As there is a time to riſe, ſo ordinarily a time to fall. The Wiſe man gives us a very apt Figurative De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, of the Decline of Humane Strength &amp; Glory; the Decrepit State of the Children of Men, after a conſiderable ſpace of Health, Strength, Beauty and Activity. <hi>In the day when the keepers of the houſe ſhall tremble, and the ſtrong men ſhall bow themſelves, and the grinders ceaſe becauſe they are few, and thoſe that look out of the windows be darkned, And the doors ſhall be ſhut in the ſtreets, when the ſound of the grinding is low, and he ſhall riſe up at the voice of the Bird, And all the daughters of muſick ſhall be brought low;
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002123_0015_0FBC1FC11FB55328"/>
Alſo when they ſhall be afraid of that which is high, and fears ſhall be in the way, and the almond-tree ſhall flouriſh &amp; the graſhopper ſhall be a burden, and deſire ſhall fail,</hi> Eccl. I2. 3, 4, 5. Thus the Eyes are dim, the Ears dull, the Countenance wan and pale; and many other Symptoms of a Declining condition.</p>
            <p>When a People have had their Flouriſhing time, and are paſt the Flower of their Age; If Juſtice, Righteouſneſs, Holineſs, Meekneſs, Brotherly-kindneſs, &amp; Charity, meet with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner of Entertainment than hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; it would be as Wonderful as Comfortable, if ſuch a People ſhould again return to the days of their Youth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When the means uſed for a Peoples Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery prove Ineffectual.

Thus when a People are come to that paſs, that neither Sickneſs, or Health, War or Peace, Scarcity or Plenty, Mercies or Judgments, Corroſives or Leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; the unweared endeavours of the Magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

or ſo much as to any conſiderable degree of Reformation; but a People will run over Law and Goſpel, and do that which is right in their own Eyes, in Deſpite of the Powers above and below; they are like the Ground that Yearly brings forth nothing <hi>but Briers &amp; Thorns</hi>; (Notwithſtanding its drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the rains that come oft upon it) and is therefore Rejected nigh unto Curſing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6 8 Or like the Vineyard, which after all that was beſtowed upon it, brought forth nothing but <hi>Wild Grapes</hi>; and was therefore Condemned to be laid waſte, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.6.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When a People have no Heart, and ſo will take no pains to help themſelves. Not only refuſe, and ſcorn the Help of others, but will do nothing for their own Relief. Either are ſo Stupid that they have loſt all manner of ſenſe of their Condition, or elſe are ſo Liſtleſs, that they will rather run the Chance and Hazard, of every thing that is Dear &amp; Valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, than be at any conſiderable Pains and Charges, for their own Deliverance. Now when a People are ſo Beſotted, and Stupify'd, that they are grown into an Indifferency whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they Live or Die, they'l tamely Yield to the courſe of their Diſeaſe; if it Mitigate of it ſelf well; if it rage it's all alike. Sometimes a People are ſo Infatuated by Satan, and Buried
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002123_0017_0FBC1FC4846D0E80"/>
in their own Vanitys, that they have not a thought about diverting the courſe of their Sins, or Gods Judgments: They Imitate the Old World, that could Eat &amp; Drink, Marry Wives, &amp; give in Marriage, till Noe entered into the Ark, and ſo the Flood came and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed them all. And likewiſe <hi>Sodom,</hi> that could Eat and Drink, Buy and Sell, Plant and Build, until the Day that Lot left them; and it Rained Fire and Brimſtone from Heaven, and Deſtroyed them all, <hi>Luk.</hi> I7.27, 28, 29. Now ſuch a People (and more eſpecially, a Profeſſing, and Priviledged People;) as have no Heart nor Spirit, to Reflect on their Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs; to look into their Spiritual Condition; but can ſay to themſelves, Take your Eaſe, Eat, Drink and be Merry; when the very Heavens are ready to reveal their Iniquity, and the Earth to riſe up againſt them; verily ſuch a People are Dying with a Witneſs: They are at leaſt in the way to Commit all Iniquity with Greedineſs; and to treat God, &amp; all that is Good with High-handed Contempt.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>We ſhall conſider, What makes ſuch a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Decline and Languiſh.</hi> And here I intend only to give a few hints at ſome Plain and Obvious Things, that Hurt and Weaken a People. And</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:002123_0018_0FBC1FC59C24A6A0"/>I. <hi>The Unexemplarineſs of Men that make a Principal Figure, in the Places where they Live</hi>: And this, on the Account either of their Age, Abilitys, Profeſſion or Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment either in Town, Church or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Wealth. If ſuch as theſe don't carry it well, are Falſe to their Word; to their Truſt; are Contentious, Covetous, Uncharitable, Proud, Intemperate, Unjuſt, Cruel, Wanton, and the like: I may ſay that ſuch as theſe (eſpecially) by ſuch manners, do give a deep Wound to Religion, &amp; Vertue, in the Places where they Live. And the ill Savour of theſe things will Diffuſe it ſelf as far as their Improvement and Names Extend. As Dead Flies in the Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Apothecary, cauſes it to ſend forth a ſtinking Savour: So doth a little Folly him that is in Reputation for Wiſdom, &amp; Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, <hi>Eccl.</hi> I0.I. And as on the one hand ſuch are had in abomination by the truly Pious, and ſuch as are hurt by their Unexemplary Conduct; ſo on the other hand, many will make uſe of ſuch mens Lives, as an Argument to Juſtify, or a Cloak to Cover, their Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Contempt of Vertue, &amp; Goodneſs. There is in many a great Ambition to Imitate thoſe that are above them, in Vice as well as Vertue.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>And</hi> (which was touched in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going particular) <hi>the Diſproportion there is
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002123_0019_0FBC1FC8F8EEE7C8"/>
between the Pretences and Practice of many High Profeſſors, hurts a People.</hi> Some make a Loud Noiſe about Religion; cry out concerning the Sins of a Land; are very ſevere in cenſuring others; give Sacred Things a high Character; are Zealous for God and Chriſt in Words and Geſtures; and yet are themſelves very Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, &amp; Defective in ſome conſiderable Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of a Chriſtian Life. It may be they <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Make their <hi>Boaſt of the Law,</hi> and yet through <hi>breaking the Law Diſhonour God,</hi> as the Apoſtle Expresseth it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.23. Such are Diſſerviceable to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; for if they be Men of an Eſtabliſhed Reputation, many will do like them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting to Fare in the Day of Judgment as well as ſuch: As for others as men loath them becauſe they eſteem them Hypocrites, ſo many will be ready to Abhor the very Religion of which ſuch make ſo notable a Profeſſion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Declining Religious Communication; eſpecially by the Wiſer ſort of Men Weakens a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> God Commanded Iſrael, not only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain His Words in their Hearts: But <hi>to talk of them when they ſat in their Houſes,</hi> when they <hi>Walked by the Way,</hi> when they <hi>lay Down</hi> &amp; when

               <hi>they Aroſe, Deut.</hi> 6.7. Doubtleſs the deſign in this Charge was, that the Knowledge and Love of theſe things, might be Preſerved, and Promoted among them. But this is (it may be) by many of the Abler ſort, accounted a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible way of Improving their Talents; they think it more proper for the Weak and Feeble part of Mankind. But this is no Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to Men of Underſtanding: The Pſalmiſt thought ſo, when he Declared that <hi>he would ſpeak of Gods Teſtimonies before kings and not be aſhamed, Pſal.</hi> II9.46 Were theſe things duely Maintained, &amp; Promoted among both Great and Small, and the Great would Soberly Condeſcend to Men of Low Degree, 'twould it may be give no little Life &amp; Energy to Religion and Goodneſs among a People; for ſo all would be Directed, Comforted, and Encouraged. <hi>Ointment &amp; Perfume, Rejoyce the Heart; ſo doth the ſweetneſs of a mans Friend by hearty Counſel. Iron ſharpneth Iron, ſo a man ſharpneth the countenance of his Friend,</hi> Prov. 27.9, I7.</p>
            <p>But if the more Accompliſhed, mind no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Earthly things, the Simple are in great danger of erring in their Spiritual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes, and Degenerating with them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Neglecting the Riſing Generation has no little tendency towards the Ruine of a People.</hi> If
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002123_0021_0FBC1FCBA7070EF0"/>
their Government and Education in Families, and their Spiritual Nouriſhment in Churches, be for the moſt part neglected; what may be expected, but <hi>an Increaſe of Sinful Men?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I might add, that of Mens Living ſo Remote, from Places of Publick Worſhip and Education. For altho' it ſeems Una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable as to many; yet it has a fatal ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency: For not a few are ready to make uſe of ſuch an Inconveniency, if not as an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Juſtify, yet as an Excuſe for the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance &amp; Irreligiouſneſs of themſelves and theirs. And indeed Ignorance, Rudeneſs, &amp; Prophaneneſs reigns among many ſuch. In not a few ſuch Unhappy Families, is found a ſad Neglect of the Soul; and a readineſs to Embrace any Vanity or Iniquity, to which their Hearts Incline them and Satan Tempts them. It would Grieve ones Soul to ſee a Numerous and Plentiful Increaſe, of reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creatures Scattered up and down the Wilderneſs, as Sheep, having no Shepherd.</p>
            <p>The IMPROVEMENT of this Truth may be in Three Words;</p>
            <p n="1">

            </p>
            <p>And</p>

Yet according to the nature and manner, of moſt things under the Sun, that which is Languiſhing, &amp; ready to Vaniſh away ſeldom Revives. Particular perſons indeed have been under manifeſt Decays, yet have been Reſtored: But when they have been Apparently under the Symptoms of Death, have ſeldom Liv'd long. Applicable to this is that Objection which Iſrael ſeem'd to offer againſt themſelves, <hi>If our Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and our Sins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how ſhould we then Live?</hi> Ezek 33.I0, And here we may ſay concerning a People, that have been, &amp; yet are, under Advantages to recover themſelves, that in caſe Death rides

Now altho' it be thus, a Peoples Sinful, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed Circumſtances, are a Provocation to God to Blaſt their Endeavours, to reduce them to great Straits, to deny his Bleſſing to the means which they Injoy, for their Natural, and Spiritual Comfort. By theſe they are alſo Expoſed to great Shame and Diſgrace, as alſo to be Devoured one of another.</p>

And what Satan ſaid with reſpect to <hi>Job</hi> is doubtleſs true in the general, <hi>Skin for Skin, yea all that a man hath, will he give for his Life,</hi> Job 24. How then doth this upbraid mens Negligence, in thoſe things that greatly concern the Comfort of their Natural Life; as alſo that ſtate of theirs, which is to be Immutable, &amp; Everlaſting?</p>
            <p>It looks as if the Apoſtaſy had ſo Inverted the order of Humane Nature, and Reaſon, that great things ſeem Indifferent; and that which is Sinful, or of no great Moment, as the <hi>Magnum Op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">I. <hi>The Negligent.</hi> Some there be, that are it may be groſly Negligent, in, and of their Families; Neglectful of the Government, and Education of their Children; bring them up indeed, but not in the <hi>Nurture and Admonition of the Lord,</hi> Pray not at all among them, or for them; or if they do, 'tis but rarely, and as faintly. Fury belongs to them that call
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:002123_0027_0FBC1FD49FEA78A0"/>
not on the Name of God, for ſuch do not a little towards, <hi>Devouring Jacob &amp; laying his Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation Deſolate, Jer.</hi> I0. ult. Many of theſe 'tis like would gladly be look't upon as very Devout in their Cloſets, but it ſeems to be no great breach of Charity, to Conclude, that ſuch as are Heathens in their Families, are not very good Chriſtians in their Cloſets. It ſounds like a Contradiction, that Men ſhould have a tender Regard to their own Souls, and none to the Souls of thoſe that are about 'em.</p>
            <p>Some plead they want <hi>an Inſtitution for Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prayer.</hi> Very like, ſuch were never at a loſs about the <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> before they had loſt <hi>the Inclination.</hi> And if they could regain the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, they would ſoon furniſh themſelves with Arguments both Rational, &amp; Scriptural, to juſtify ſuch a Practice. I ſuppoſe this is a point moſt Diſputed, when and where Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty does abound, and the Love of many is grown Cold.</p>
            <p>Again, Thoſe that Neglect the <hi>Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip &amp; Ordinances of God.</hi> Not only the Holy Sacraments are practically Deſpiſed; but the Ordinary Worſhip of God. The Houſe of God is Unfrequented by them. They are far from the Pſalmiſts ſpirit, who accounted <hi>a day in Gods Courts better than a thouſand, Pſal.</hi> 84. I0. But theſe will eaſily be detained. Some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

Works of Neceſſity &amp; Mercy, or Bodily Indiſpoſition (more ſeigned than true) ſome Difficulty in the ſeaſon, and ſuch like: But the bottom of all is the want of an Heart to the Duty.</p>
            <p>'Tis Probable there be thoſe that have little Heart to attend on the ſtated Worſhip of God, who chearfully wait on ſome other Publick Solemnity's and as probable that their deſign is Earthly and Senſual, that 'tis more for their Recreation than their Edification; for the Gratification of their Luſts, rather than the salvation of their Souls. Moſt likely, they aim at what God ſolemnly forbids, viz. <hi>Rioting and Drunkinneſs, Chambering &amp; Wantonneſs</hi>— And inſtead of putting on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, they intend to make <hi>Proviſion for the fleſh, to fulfil the luſts thereof, Rom,</hi> I2, I3, I4.</p>
            <p>Moreover ſuch as Neglect <hi>their Callings,</hi> Work not at all, or but very little: whoſe Hands refuſe to Labour. Theſe ſet ill Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, are Chargeable and Burdenſom; are making U proars, &amp; carriying on Factions in the places where they Live; whilſt the Honeſt La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers, are Sweating &amp; Toiling to Maintain them: for by that time the Labourers have gathered in their Increaſe, theſe wanderers have deviſed ſome Unjuſtifiable methods, to make a conſiderable part of it their own.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:002123_0029_0FBC1FDAD2E2DE90"/>2. <hi>Men of Unſavoury Language.</hi> Yea, yea; and Nay, nay; is as eaſy to Pronounce, as the Prophane Stuff, the Vain Jeſts, &amp; Horrid Oaths, now in Credit with many. The Apostle <hi>James</hi> ſets forth this Miſchievous, Inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Folly, to the Life, telling us that the <hi>Tongue is a fire, a world of Iniquity,</hi> that it <hi>ſets on fire the courſe of nature; and is ſet on fire of Hell.</hi> That <hi>therewith men Bleſs God &amp; Curſe men, which are made after the Similitude of God. Jam.</hi> 3.6, 9. If ſuch did ſeriouſly conſider the Evil which they bring upon themſelves; how hurtful they are to their fellow Creatures; what confuſions, &amp; quarrels they are the Authors of, by ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications; and what an Account Men will have to give at laſt for every Idle Word. 'Twould lay them under ſome Reſtraint.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Exceſſive Drinkers.</hi> Indeed every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God is good; ſtrong Drinks are ſo; and would be a conſiderable Support to the natural Spirits, Revive humane Nature, make Men more fit for Service, were they Improved in due ſeaſon, manner &amp; meaſure. The Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist tells us that <hi>Wine maketh glad the Heart of man,</hi> Pſal. I04. I5. But the Immoderate uſe of theſe things, is exceeding Hurtful: Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes to their coſt have found it ſo. This is a Sin which is but ſeldom Repented of, or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken, till 'tis too late: until Nature is ſo weakened
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:002123_0030_0FBC1FDC55D055D8"/>
weakened and diſordered; that it cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form its ſeveral Offices: And the Body cannot by any means, or Medicines, be Reduced to a good ſtate; but muſt return to its Duſt after much Languiſhing &amp; Miſery. And as for the Souls of ſuch, 'tis moſt likely they are going to that Wrath, which they have Treaſured up, thro' much Impenitency, &amp; hardneſs of Heart.</p>
            <p>By <hi>Intemperate Drinking,</hi> much time is waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, eſtates diminiſhed, and ſo the Drinkers, &amp; their Families Impoveriſhed; their Names are ruined, their Stomachs overcharged, their Brains over heated, &amp; their Conſciences fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This makes the Diligent Sluggiſh; the Frugal Prodigal; the Wiſe Simple; the Modeſt Impudent, and Loathſome, both in Words and Actions: Would to God ſuch would be Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed by <hi>Solomon, &amp; not took upon the Wine, when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, and moveth it ſelf aright</hi>: For he aſſures them, that afterwards <hi>it biteth like a ſerpent, &amp; ſtingeth like an adder.</hi> Prov. 23.2I, 32. Such often experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the Truth, of what he Aſſerts; but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be perſwaded to embrace his Counſel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Taverns</hi> are too often the places of ungodly mens Extravagancy's; the Chambers where miſchief and vanity walk in Triumph: here men of all Ranks and Profeſſions, are made <hi>the Song of Drunkards</hi>; here ſtriſes, debates, whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perings,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002123_0031_0FBC1FDE0E57A180"/>
ſwellings and tumults, are Cheriſhed; here men <hi>caſt fire-brands, arrow, &amp; death, and then ſay that they are in ſport.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I might here ſay, that when &amp; where it ſo happens, that men of looſe Principles, greedy of filthy lucre, left to their Liberty; men whoſe ſubſiſtance depends upon this manner of living are the Maſters of ſuch Houſes; they that will be filthy, may be ſo: for they ſhall have opportunity to gratify their Luſts, and Friends to cover the multitude of their Abominations.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Such as Revile, or Speak Evil of Rulers.</hi> We are bound, not to ſpeak evil of any man; and then certainly not of Rulers. To revile any is a Sin, becauſe it is a Tranſgreſſion of Gods Command: but its greatned &amp; aggravated, when directed againſt Superiors. Such as ſpeak evil of the things that they underſtand not, cannot be innocent, or excuſable, ſince the Apoſtle ſets them forth, by <hi>natural brute beaſts, made to be taken &amp; deſtroyed</hi>; 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.I2. Such a Sin muſt be great, which ſtrikes at the power of thoſe that Govern; and the peace of them that are Governed.</p>
            <p>Complainers &amp; Revilers always make ſome fair colours and pretences for what they ſay againſt Rulers. And it is no new thing, for men to think themſelves right in their own
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:002123_0032_0FBC1FDF2B3806A0"/>
cauſe, altho' the whole proceeding be really a very wrong thing. <hi>Korah</hi> and his Company, boldly told <hi>Moſes &amp; Aaron,</hi> that they took too much upon them: But God ſoon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced them of their error &amp; folly in a terrible manner.</p>
            <p>If Rulers really do amiſs; (as there is none Abſolutely Perfectly &amp; Invariably Good but GOD) it better becomes men to Pray for them, than Prate againſt them.</p>
            <p>Now altho' we are to treat Rulers with great Deference, &amp; intreat them as Fathers; yet good Rulers will Bear to be Humbly and Modeſtly put in mind of their failings &amp; miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes: yea will doubtleſs ſay with <hi>David, let the righteous ſmite me, it ſhall be a kindneſs; and Let him reprove me, it ſhall be an excellent oil, which ſhall not break my head, Pſal.</hi> I4I.5.</p>
            <p>But to Curſe &amp; Revile is the way of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant, head-ſtrong, ſtiff-necked, &amp; haughty Generation. <hi>John came neither eating nor drinking, and they ſay, he hath a Devil: The Son of Man, came eating and drinking, and they ſay, behold a gluttonous man, and a wine bibber, a friend of publicans &amp; ſinners, Mat</hi> II.I8, I9. And ſuch kind of treatment as this, may Civil Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, (as well as JESUS and his Meſſenger) expect, (&amp; the more faithful the more curſes) from ſuch as cannot bear to be Reformed nor
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:002123_0033_0FBC1FE0A0607B90"/>
Governed. Such men would be thought to have a very great affection, for the Publick Weal, I ſuppoſe this to be a very indirect way to promote it. May not ſuch Revilings ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be thought to be the effects of Pride, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, Envy, Emulation, and ſuch like?</p>
            <p>If any ſuch Covet the Honour of being Rulers; they may do Wiſely to conſider, the Burden as well as the Honour of Government: And what an Emperor once ſaid when he Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved people to gaze on his Purple Robe and Golden Crown, <hi>Did you know what Cares are under them, you would not take them from the Ground to have them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Honour be the thing that ſuch aim at, they ſhould therewith remember, that they would take but little Pleaſure in it, if others ſhould at this rate attempt to practiſe upon them: Yea a Vain-glorious Spirit, can ſcarcely bear the leaſt Affront. <hi>Haman</hi> declared, that <hi>the glory of his Riches,</hi> the <hi>multitude of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and the ſingular reſpect the King and Queen had ſhewed him,</hi> (having honoured him above the reſt of the Princes) <hi>Availed him nothing. Eſter</hi> 5.II, I2, I3. And that which filled him with diſcontent &amp; rage was, that <hi>Mordecai refuſed to riſe up or move for him.</hi>

               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:002123_0034_0FBC1FE21FFED778"/>III. By way of EXHORTATION.</p>
            <p>If this Truth be Applicable to us, then this Word may be Directed</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>To all ſuch as have, or ſhall this Day be called to take the Civil</hi> (and therewith not a little of the Religious) <hi>Concerns of this People under their Care and Management.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let all ſuch be humbly Intreated to be of one Heart, in endeavouring to be to this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>as the Rain upon the mowen Grafts: as ſhowers that water the Earth.</hi> Such muſt needs Pity us; for as our Sins are upon us, ſo the Hand of GOD is often touching us.</p>
            <p>I may at this time offer a few Words, more eſpecially to the Honourable GOVERNOUR, and DEPUTY-<hi>Governour,</hi> with the <hi>Worſhipful</hi> ASSISTANTS.</p>
            <p>You will give me leave (<hi>Honourable &amp; Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipful</hi>) Humbly and Submiſſively to Beſeech You <hi>to do what may be done for this languiſhing People that are round about you.</hi> You have for ſome time obſerved us to be <hi>ready to Die</hi>; but as yet we are not <hi>quite Dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What I would here ſay, is only to <hi>ſtir up your pure minds, by way of remembrance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then, That ſomething extraordinary is expected from Civil Rulers. Such are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:002123_0035_0FBC1FE39D00AEC0"/>
unto Appointed by God, &amp; deſigned by Men; to do ſomething more than others. And as they are laid under ſingular Obligations, ſo have they ſome ſpecial Opportunities of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving their Talents, for the good of a great many. Thoſe to whom much is Given and Committed, of them <hi>GOD will require,</hi> and <hi>men will expect the more.</hi> GOD expects you ſhould be, <hi>Good men</hi> Pray that you may be, and only <hi>ungodly men</hi> deſire &amp; endeavour that you may not be, <hi>the Glory and Stability of our Times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There be many that can do little more than Pray for us; and thoſe that are Perſons of conſiderable Abilities, are obliged to reſtrain the Improvement of them, within the bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of their ſeveral Stations: And that which might be very Diſorderly, and ſinful in ſome others to do or attempt, may be a great Duty &amp; vertue in Rulers. <hi>GOD is a God of Order,</hi> not of <hi>Confuſion</hi>: And as in a Natural Body, ſo in a Civil, there be indeed <hi>many Members</hi>; yet all have not the ſame, but their <hi>ſeveral Offices.</hi> So that altho' the deſign of an action be good, yet if in the doing of it men break their Ranks, and ſtep out of their Places, God will not be well Pleaſed with them. Now God hath put into the hands of Civil Rulers, the Reins of Government and the Sword of
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:002123_0036_0FBC1FE52423CCF0"/>
Judgment, that they might be able to reſtrain and ſubdue thoſe hardy Sinners, that will not be reduced by Counſel, Perſwaſion, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
            <p>Again; Altho' it may be very diſcouraging in it ſelf, to be Concerned with a People of a froward ſpirit; yet the more troubleſom we are grown, the more need have we of your Zeal and united Endeavours for our Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>If Rulers at ſuch a time ſhould ſlacken their Hands, good Men in ſome pang of Zeal, might be apt to ſtep out of their Places: And as for the Wicked, they want nothing but an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to thruſt themſelves into other mens Offices; and put all things into Confuſion. <hi>Abſalom</hi> perſwaded the people, that there was no man deputed to hear them: and then adds, <hi>Oh that I were made a judge in the land, that every man that hath any ſuit or cauſe, would come to me, and I would do him juſtice,</hi> 2 Sam. I5.4. And his Project with a <hi>few Kiſſes,</hi> took with the People, and thus he ſtole away their Hearts: But a terrible Convulſion, Diſtraction and Slaughter ſoon followed.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Korah</hi> rebellion, <hi>Moſes</hi> does not ſink under diſcouragement; nor ſay as a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Numb. II.I4. <hi>I am not able to bear all this people alone, becauſe it is too heavy for me.</hi> But

beſtirs himſelf, and puts on the Courage and Zeal that became him; and GOD wrought with him, and for him; for His own Glory, and <hi>Iſraels</hi> Safety &amp; quiet, in the Conviction of the Congregation, and in the Deſtruction of thoſe Sinners againſt their own Souls.</p>
            <p>And further; It is to be Acknowledged, that you have done many worthy deeds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, and for us. And altho' there may be ungrateful and ungovernable Spirits among us; yet 'tis to be hoped that there remains very ſignificant numbers, that will heartily Submit to your Government, and ſtrengthen your Hands, in all your further endeavours for our good.</p>
            <p>Moreover; If you ſhould recover us, you would have a double portion of the Glory and Comfort of ſuch a happy Revolution: You ſhall ſpend the remains of your days in quiet; after you have ſeen what I doubt not you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer above <hi>your chief Joy.</hi> You ſhall be highly Eſteemed; and men every where, ſhall Bleſs God that hath made you the healers of our breaches; yea you ſhall (by way of Eminency) be had in everlaſting Remembrance.</p>
            <p>Alſo; I may ſay, we are a People, many of whoſe Fathers, were ſome of <hi>the beſt of Men.</hi> Men of excellent Spirits. We may in a good ſenſe, be ſaid to be <hi>Children of the ſtock of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>:

Children of the Prophets, and of the Covenant which God made with our Fathers. <hi>Act.</hi> 3.25. Were we the Children of <hi>baſe men,</hi> yet it would grieve you to ſee us pine away in our Iniquities: And much more ſince we are not only Gods Covenant People; but ſuch for whom, <hi>our Fathers have laid up a liberal ſtock of Prayers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And may I here add; That when you ſhall arrive at the pleaſant Land, thoſe of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are gone before, ſhall Embrace you, with exceeding Joy &amp; Thankfulneſs for your Care &amp; Kindneſs, to their Periſhing Progeny.</p>
            <p>Finally; So often as your Inferiours ſtand before you at the Bar; are you put in mind of the great, and Notable Day: when you ſhall be plentifully rewarded, for all the good, you have done, or may do, for us. What you give to this People ſhall be given you again; good meaſure, preſſed down and ſhaken together; yea running over. I truſt you will be able to ſay at laſt with <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Iſa. 38.3. <hi>Remember now, O Lord, I beſeech thee, how I have walked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, in truth, &amp; with a perfect heart, &amp; have done that which is good in thy ſight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>To Goſpel</hi>-MINISTERS.</p>
            <p>Both God and Men expect, that the Zeal, Wiſdom and Faithfulneſs of this venerable
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:002123_0039_0FBC1FED5D865980"/>
Order of men, ſhould be ſomewhat Excelling. Such are called the <hi>Salt of the Earth, &amp; Light of the World.</hi> And as they <hi>repreſent CHRIST,</hi> ſo its expected that they ſhould <hi>imitate him,</hi> and cleave cloſer to him, (eſpecially in a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining time) than is expected from ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. CHRIST was Induſtrious, Zealous, Holy, Harmleſs, and Undefiled; and ſpent His whole time and life, for the deſtroying Satans Kingdom, &amp; advancing the Kingdom of God in the World: All his Miniſters ſhould, and all good Miniſters will labour to be, &amp; do ſo. Much is expected from thoſe that <hi>Profeſs Chriſt</hi>; but more from ſuch as <hi>Perſonate Him.</hi> It was a very ſolemn Queſtion our SAVIOUR put to the Apoſtles, <hi>Will ye alſo go away</hi>? Joh. 6.67. Which ſhews that if all others ſhould Apoſtatize &amp; forſake him, yet he expects that his <hi>Miniſters</hi> ſhould ſtand by him. Its left upon Record for an everlaſting Praiſe to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> that they continued with CHRIST in his <hi>Temptations,</hi> Luk. 22.28.</p>
            <p>Again; The work of ſuch men is a work of the greateſt Weight and Moment: They are properly &amp; nextly Concerned about the <hi>Souls of Men,</hi> and their <hi>Eternal Salvation.</hi> If a man loſe his Life thro' the neglect of him that hath the charge of it, yet 'tis poſſible his Soul may be Saved; or if he loſe his Eſtate in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:002123_0040_0FBC1FEEE411DF18"/>
yet 'tis poſſible he may recover himſelf, and gain another as good or better: But if the Soul be loſt the man is gone forever. All the treaſures in the World cannot make up this Loſs. <hi>It's not thouſands of Rams,</hi> or <hi>ten thouſands of rivers of Oil that can redeem him,</hi> Mic. 6.7. Therefore they that have the charge of Souls, have a concern of Infinite Worth.</p>
            <p>Again; Such by reaſon of the Nature of their work, are advantaged to be ſome of the moſt Spiritual men in the world. Their work is properly Spiritual: they are neceſſarily, principally, and in a manner intirely, taken up about ſuch things, as nextly concern, the Kingdom of Chriſt, and the Eternal State of men, <hi>They ſhall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Iſrael thy law: they ſhall put incenſe before thee, &amp; whole burnt-ſacrifice upon thine altar,</hi> Deut. 33 I0 Such are under ſingular Advantages to know the Will of God; to be Confirmed &amp; Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the great Doctrines of the Goſpel: to know the Greatneſs &amp; Cer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It being thus, its expected that Miniſters be
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:002123_0041_0FBC1FF05FBF26C8"/>
men, frequent &amp; mighty <hi>in Prayer</hi> eſpecially when men are generally going off from God, It is very obſervable, how the Spirit of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication reſted on <hi>Elijah</hi>; for his heart being hot within him, and his Soul grieved on the madneſs &amp; miſery of Iſrael he Pray<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I8 36, 37 Now in ſuch ſolemn &amp; ſervent Addreſſes to GOD, Miniſters may expect the Concurrence of all that are fearers of God, that have a genuine Love to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind that have not bowed the Knee to the Idols of this Generation; that have been look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; longing for the Returns of God's Holy Spirit upon a People, that are almoſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted and Gone.</p>
