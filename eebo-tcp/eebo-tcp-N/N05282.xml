            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>An Act giving further Encouragement for the Importation of Naval Stores; and for other Purposes therein mentioned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>WHEREAS in the Third, and Fourth Years of the Reign of Her late Majesty Queen</hi> Anne, <hi>a good Law was made for Encouraging the Importation of Naval Stores from Her Majesty's Plantations in</hi> America, <hi>by an Act which commenced the First Day of</hi> January,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Preamble.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>One thousand seven hundred, and five, and continued from thence forward for the space of Nine Years; and by an Act made in the Twelfth Year of Her said late Majesty's Reign, the aforesaid Act is continued from the time of the Expiration of the same, for the further Term of Eleven Years, and from thence to the End of the next Session of Parliament; and by the Act last mentioned, Encouragement is given for the Importation of Naval Stores from that Part of</hi> Great Britain <hi>called</hi> Scotland, <hi>to that Part of</hi> Great Britain <hi>called</hi> England, <hi>during the Remainder of the time limited for granting Premiums to the Importers of Naval Stores from</hi> America, <hi>by the said Acts: And whereas in Consequence of the said Encouragement, it is found by Experience that great Quantities of Good, and Merchantable Pitch, and Tar (part of the Naval Stores mentioned in the said Acts) have been imported into this Kingdom from the said Plantations in</hi> America, <hi>which Pitch and Tar have been found useful for the Service of His Majesty's Navy, and it is necessary to give farther Encouragement therein: And whereas it is probable that the Owners of large Tracts of Land in the said Plantations, and in that Part of</hi> Great Britain <hi>called</hi> Scotland, <hi>lying near the Sea, and upon Navigable Rivers, would be induced to sow the same with Hemp, if farther Encouragement were given for that Purpose</hi>:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:006677_0003_1029A6CEB1BB9528"/>May it therefore Please Your Most Excellent Majesty, That it may be Enacted,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And be it Enacted by the King's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the Advice, and Consent of the Lord's Spiritual, and Temporal, and Commons in this Present Parliament Assembled, and by the Authority of the same,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Premium for Ton of Hemp water-rotted, &amp;c continued from Expira<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of the Act 12 Anne, for 16 Years, &amp;c.</note> That the Premium, or Reward of Six Pounds given by the said Acts for every Ton of Hemp water-rotted, bright, and clean, each Ton containing Twenty Gross Hundreds, and Six Pounds, shall be continued from the Expiration of the said Act of the Twelfth Year of Her said late Majesty's Reign, for, and during the Term of Sixteen Years, and from thence to the End of the next Session of Parliament; and shall be paid, and payable in the same manner,<note place="margin">Hemp im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported after 24 of June 1722. Duty-free</note> and under the same Rules, Methods, and Restrictions, as are prescribed in, and by the said former Acts, or either of them, touching the same; and all such Hemp, being lawfully imported into this Kingdom after the Four, and twentieth Day of <hi>June,</hi> One thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand seven hundred, and twenty two, shall be free, and clear of, and from all Duties, Customs, and Impositions whatsoever, payable to His Majesty, His Heirs, or Successors; Any Law, Custom, or other Matter, or Thing to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And Whereas great Quantities of Wood, and Timber, and of the Goods commonly called Lumber, herein after particularly enumerated</hi> (That is to say) <hi>Deals of several Sorts, Timber-Balks of several Sizes, Barrel-Boards, Clap-Boards, Pipe-Boards, or Pipe-Holt, White-Boards for Shoe-makers, Boom, and Cant-Spars, Bow-Staves, Capravens, Clap-Holt, Ebony-Wood, Headings for Pipes, and for Hogsheads, and Barrels, Hoops for Coopers, Oars, Pipe, and Hogshead-Staves, Barrel-Staves, Firkin-Staves, Trunnels, Speckled-Wood, Sweet Wood, Small Spars, Oak, Plank, and Wainscot, or some of them, have usually been imported into this Kingdom from Foreign Countries at excessive Rates, or Prices, especially in Time of War, and Foreigners have thereby found Opportunities to export the coined Monies of this Realm; and it is well known that the said Commodities, being of the Growth, and Product of His Majesty's Plantations in</hi> America, <hi>may be furnished from thence if due Encouragement was given in that Behalf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Be it therefore Enacted by the Authority aforesaid,</hi> That all, and every Person, and Persons who within the Term of One and Twenty Years,<note place="margin">Wood, Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, &amp;c. (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Masts, &amp;c) import<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed, from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, for 21 Years after 24 of June, 1722. Duty-free</note> to be reckoned from the Four, and twentieth Day of <hi>June,</hi> One thousand seven hundred, and twenty two, shall import, or cause to be imported into <hi>Great Britain,</hi> directly from any of His Majesty's <hi>British</hi> Plantations or Colonies in <hi>America,</hi> in any Ship, or Vessel, Ships, or Vessels, which may lawfully trade to, or from His Majesty's said Plantations, or Colonies, and which shall be navigated according to Law, any sort of Wood, Plank, or Timber whatsoever, Wrought, or Unwrought, or any of the Goods called Lumber, before in this Act enumerated, such Wood, Plank, Timber, and Lumber, being of the Growth, and Product of the said Plantations, or Colonies, or some of them (except Masts, Yards, and Bow-sprits, touching which Duties, and Premiums are ascertained by former Acts in that behalf) shall and may import the same free from all Customs, and Impositions whatsoever, granted to His Majesty, His Heirs, or Successors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:006677_0004_1029A6D075CE75B8"/>And to the End, His Majesty's Royal Navy may, from time to time, have the Benefit of so much of such Hemp, as shall be requisite for the Service thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid,</hi> That upon the Importation of any Hemp, for which any Bounty, or Premium is by this, or any former Act given, the Preemption,<note place="margin">Such Hemp not contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for by them within 20 Days, to be otherwise disposed of.</note> or Refusal of such Hemp shall be offered, and tendred to the Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy, or some of their Agents for the time being, upon landing the same; and if within the space of Twenty Days after such Tender, the said Commissioners shall not contract, or bargain for the same, it shall be lawful for the Importer, or Importers, Owner, or Owners of such Hemp, otherwise to dispose thereof, as by Law they may, for his, her, or their best Profit, and Advantage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And Whereas in and by the said Act made in the Third, and Fourth Years of Her said late Majesty Queen</hi> Anne, <hi>Intituled,</hi> An Act for En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging the Importation of Naval Stores from Her Majesties Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in <hi>America, a Reward, or Premium was given for Tar brought into this Kingdom, directly from Her Majesties Plantations in</hi> America, <hi>after the Rate of</hi> Four Pounds <hi>for every Ton of Good, and Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Tar, under such Rules, Regulations, and Provisoes, as are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in mentioned; which Act was continued by one other Act made in the Twelfth Year of the same Reign, Intituled,</hi> An Act for continuing an Act made in the Third, and Fourth Years of the Reign of Her present Majesty, <hi>Intituled,</hi> An Act for Encouraging the Importation of Naval Stores from Her Majesties Plantations in <hi>America</hi>; and for Encouraging the Importation of Naval Stores from that Part of <hi>Great Britain</hi> called <hi>Scotland,</hi> to that Part of <hi>Great Britain</hi> called <hi>England, and is still in Force; and by the said last mentioned Act the like Reward, or Premium of</hi> Four Pounds per <hi>Ton, was extended to and given for Tar brought from that Part of</hi> Great Britain <hi>called</hi> Scotland, <hi>to that Part of</hi> Great Britain <hi>called</hi> England, <hi>under the like Rules, Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Provisoes, as in the Case of Plantation Tar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And Whereas by one other Act passed in the Fifth Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, Intituled,</hi> An Act against Clandestine Running of uncustomed Goods; and for the more Effectual preventing of Frauds relating to the Customs, <hi>the said Reward, or Premium is to be allowed for such Tar only as should be clean, good, merchantable, and well conditioned, and fit for making Cordage; and nevertheless, the Tar imported from the said Plantations has hitherto been found to retain an hot, and thick Quality, whereby it is not so fit for making Cordage, as the East Country Tar.</hi>
