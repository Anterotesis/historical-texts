         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A BILL For the government of the Navy of the United States.</head>
            <p>SEC. I. BE <hi>it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress assembled,</hi> That the following rules and regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be adopted and put in force, for the government of the navy of the United States.</p>
            <p>ARTICLE 1. The commanders of all ships and vessels belonging to the United States, are strictly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to shew in themselves a good example, of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and virtue to their officers and men, and to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vigilant in inspecting the behaviour of all such as are under them, and to discountenance and suppress, all dissolute, immoral, and disorderly practices, and also such as are contrary to the rules of discipline and obedience, and to correct those who are guilty of the same, according to the usage of the sea service.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The commanders of the ships of the United States, having on board chaplains, are to take care, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine service be performed twice a day, and a sermon preached on Sundays, unless bad weather, or other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary accidents prevent.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Any person who shall be guilty of profane swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or of drunkenness, if a seaman or marine, shall be
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:036496_0003_1009E619992A46A8"/>
put in irons until sober, and then slogged if the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain shall think proper—but if an officer, he shall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit two days pay, or incur such punishment as a court martial shall impose, and as the nature and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the offence shall deserve.</p>
            <p n="4">4. No commander, for any one offence, shall inflict any punishment upon a seaman or marine beyond twelve lashes upon his bare back with a cat of nine tails, and no other cat shall be made use of on board any ship of war, or other vessel belonging to the United States—if the fault shall deserve a greater punishment, he is to apply to the Secretary of the Navy, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief of the navy, or the commander of a squadron, in order to the trying of him by a court martial; and in the mean time he may put him under confinement.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The commander is never by his own authority to discharge a commission or warrant officer, nor to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish or strike him, but he may suspend or confine him, and when he comes in the way of the Secretary of the Navy, the commander in chief of the navy, or the commander of a squadron, may apply for holding a court martial.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The officer who commands by accident in the captain or commander's absence (unless he be absent for a time by leave) shall not order any correction but confinement, and upon the captain's return on board, he shall then give an account of his reasons for so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The captain is to cause the articles of war to be hung up in some public place of the ship, and read to the ship's company once a month.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Whenever a captain shall enter or inlist a seaman, he shall take care to enter on his books, the time and terms of his entering, in order to his being justly paid.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The captain shall, before he sails, make return to the Secretary of the Navy, a complete list of all his officers and men, with the time and terms of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, and during his cruise or station, shall keep a
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:036496_0004_1009E61B3326E110"/>
true account of the desertion or death of any of them, and of the entering of others, and after the expiration of the time for which they were entered, and before any of them are paid off, he shall make return of a complete list of the same, including those who shall remain on board his ship.</p>
            <p n="10">10. The men shall, at their request, be furnished with slops that are necessary, by order of the captain, and the amount delivered to each man, shall be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly returned by the purser, so that the same be stopt out of his pay.</p>
            <p n="11">11. All officers not having commissions or warrants, (or appointed commission or warrant officers for the time being) are termed petty, or inferior officers.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Whenever any inferior officer, seaman, or other person, be turned over into the ship of a commander other than the one with whom he entered, he is not to be rated on the ship's books, in a worse quality, or lower degree or station, than he served in the ship he was removed from; and for the guide of the captain, he is to demand from the commander of the ship from which such person or persons were turned over, a list, under his hand, of his or their names, and the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in which he or they served.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Any officer, seaman or others, entitled to wages or prize money, may have the same paid to his assignee, provided the assignment be attested by the captain and the purser; but the captain or commander of every vessel in the service of the United States, is to discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage his crew from selling any part of their wages or prize money, and never to attest the letter of attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney until he is satisfied that the same is not granted in consideration of money given for the purchase of wages, or shares of prize money.</p>
            <p n="14">14. When any officer or other person dies, the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is forthwith to have his name entered on the books of the ship, in order to the wages being forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with paid to his executors or administrators.</p>
            <p n="15">15.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:036496_0005_1009E61CB7FACB98"/>
A convenient place shall be set apart for the sick or hurt men, to which they are to be removed with their hammocks and bedding, when the surgeon shall advise the same to be necessary, and some of the crew shall be appointed to attend them, and keep the place clean;—cradles and buckets, with covers, shall be made for their use, if necessary.</p>
            <p n="16">16. All ships furnished with fishing tackle, being in such places where fish is to be had, the captain is to employ some of the company in fishing.—The fish to be daily distributed to such persons as are sick, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on recovery, provided the surgeon recommend it, and the surplus, by turns, amongst the messes of the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and seaman, gratis, without any deduction of their allowance of provisions on that account.</p>
            <p n="17">17. It is left to the discretion of commanders of squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, to shorten the allowance of provisions accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the exigence of the service, taking care that the men be punctually paid for the same—the like power is given to captains of ships acting singly, where it is deemed necessary, and if there should be a want of pork, the captain is to order three pounds of beef to be issued in lieu of two pounds of pork.</p>
            <p n="18">18. If any ships of the United States shall happen to come into port in want of provisions, the warrant of the commander of the squadron, or a captain where there is no commander of a squadron present, shall be sufficient to procure the supply of the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wanted, from the agent, or navy agent at such port.</p>
            <p n="19">19. The captains are frequently to cause to be ins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the condition of the provision, and if the bread proves damp, to have it aired upon the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deck, and other convenient places, and in case of the pickle being leaked out of the flesh casks, he is to have new pickle made and put therein, after such casks are repaired.</p>
            <p n="20">20. The captain shall cause the purser to secure the cloaths, bedding and other things, of such persons as
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:036496_0006_1009E61E5E4B8228"/>
shall die or be killed, to be delivered to their execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors or administrators.</p>
            <p n="21">21. All papers, charter-parties, bills of lading, passports, and other writings whatsoever, found on board any ship or ships which shall be taken, shall be carefully preserved and the originals sent to the court of justice for maritime affairs, appointed or to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for judging concerning such prize or prizes, and if any person or persons shall willfully or negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently destroy or suffer to be destroyed any such pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or papers, he or they so offending shall forfeit his or their share of such prize or prizes, and suffer such other punishment as they shall be judged by a court martial to deserve; and if any person or persons shall embezzle or steal, or take away any cables, anchors, sails or any of the ships furniture, or any of the powder, arms, ammunition, or provisions of any ship belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the United States, or of any prize taken by a ship or ships, aforesaid, or maltreat or steal the effects of any prisoner, he or they so offending shall suffer such punishment as a court martial shall order.</p>
            <p n="22">22. When in sight of any ship, ships or other vessels of the enemy, or at such other time as may appear ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to prepare for an engagement, the captain shall order all things in his ship in a proper posture for fight, and shall, in his own person, and according to his duty, heart on and encourage the inferior officers and men to fight courageously, and not to behave themselves faintly or cry for quarters on pain of such punishment as the offence shall appear to deserve for his neglect.</p>
            <p n="23">23. Any captain, officer or others who shall not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert himself or who shall basely desert his duty or sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the ship, and run away while the enemy is in sight, or in time of action, or shall entice others to do so, shall suffer death, or such other punishment as a court martial shall inflict.</p>
            <p n="24">24. Any officer, seaman, mariner or others, who shall disobey the orders of his superior, or begin, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:036496_0007_1009E62360714088"/>
cause or join in any mutiny or sedition in the ship to which he belongs, or in any other ship or vessel in the service of the United States, on any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence whatsoever, shall suffer death, or such other punishment as a court martial shall direct—and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, any person in any ship or vessel belonging to the service aforesaid, who shall utter any words of sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and mutiny, or endeavour to make any mutinous assembly on any pretence whatsoever, shall suffer such punishment as a court martial shall inflict.</p>
            <p n="25">25. None shall presume to quarrel with or strike his superior officer on pain of such punishment as a court martial shall order to be inflicted.</p>
            <p n="26">26. If any person, shall apprehend he has just cause of complaint, he shall quietly and decently make the same known to his superior officer, or to the captain, as the case may require, who shall take care that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice be done him.</p>
            <p n="27">27. There shall be no quarrelling or fighting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ship mates on board any ship belonging to the United States, nor shall there be used any reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or provoking speeches, tending to make quarrels and disturbances, on pain of imprisonment, or of such punishment as the captain, or a court martial shall judge proper to inflict.</p>
            <p n="28">28. If any person shall sleep upon his watch, or negligently perform the duty which shall be enjoined him to do, he shall suffer such punishment as the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, or a court martial shall inflict.</p>
            <p n="29">29. All murder shall be punished with death.</p>
            <p n="30">30. All robbery and theft, not exceeding twenty dollars, shall be punished at the discretion of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and above that sum as a court martial shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict.</p>
            <p n="31"> 31. Any master of arms, or other person of whom the like duty may be required, refusing to receive such prisoner or prisoners, as shall be committed to his charge, or having received them shall suffer him or them to escape, or dismiss them without orders from

his captain, the commander in chief of the navy or the commander of a squadron, for so doing, shall suffer in his or their stead as a court martial shall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and direct.</p>
            <p n="32">32. The captains, officers and others shall use their utmost endeavours to detect, apprehend, and bring to punishment all offenders, and shall at all times, readily assist all officers and others appointed for that purpose, in the discharge of such duty, when it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, on pain of being proceeded against and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished by a court martial at discretion.</p>
            <p n="33">33. If any officer whatsoever, mariner, marine sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, or other person, belonging to any ship or vessel of war in the service of the United States, shall give, hold or entertain intelligence to or with any enemy or rebel, without leave from the government, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in chief, or in case of a single ship, from his cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain every such person so offending, and being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of convicted by the sentence of a court martial, shall be punished with death.</p>
