            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>My Lord; there is a wide difference between riſking one's life in the cauſe of humanity, and ſitting down calmly, the ſport of unmerited misfortune. Was it my fault, that I was born of parents inferior, in point of affluence, to my Valence's? Was it I who form'd her father's heart of ſo flinty materials that he would rather ſacrifice his daughter to the embraces of a <hi>rich</hi> man ſhe <hi>deteſted,</hi> than ſee her happy in the arms of a <hi>poor</hi> man ſhe <hi>lov'd?</hi>

'tis a hard taſk for a guilty mind to unburthen itſelf, but I will endeavour to comply with your requeſt. My boy left me in the utmost deſpair, dreading the dangers which the phrenzy of hopeleſs love might drive him into. My remaining child sat with me, wept with me, reaſon'd with me, and lull'd me with hopes into a kind of placid ſtupor. Near two years elaps'd in this manner, when ſhe became penſive—ſigh'd—ſeem'd to wish to avoid even my company—and when her eyes met mine, I could obſerve them bedew'd with tears. Suppoſing grief for her brother's hopeleſs return to be the cauſe, I, in my turn; endeavoured to conſole her, but in vain! Deſpairing at length of being able to conceal it from me much longer, ſhe related the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtory—<hi>ſhe had been ſeduc'd, and abandon'd by a villain!</hi>

                     <p>About eight years ſince, my father ſent me to make the grand tour of Europe. Having a taſte for painting, I would not neglect to view the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureſque mountains and vallies of Switzerland. I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at this ſpot—going one fine morning to view the beauties of nature, heightened by the riſing ſun I met the lovely Julietta in ſearch of ſome ſtray lambs—I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired and accoſted her; her anſwers, full of ſweetneſs and ſimplicity, enchanted my youthful mind, then of a romantic turn. At parting ſhe told me, that ſhe alone
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:037784_0029_100F4D41EF279438"/>
attended an aged parent, who impatiently expected her return. Her filial piety endeared her ſo much to me, that I could ſcarce check myſelf from offering to ſhare that amiable taſk with her—with difficulty, I obtained her promiſe to ſee me again at the ſame ſpot. She kept her word—we grew intereſting to each other—interview ſucceeded interview—till firmly perſuaded of my truth and honour, ſhe <hi>yielded!!</hi>—How could her unſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mind eſcape contagion! I paſs'd the time as in a dream of happineſs; till I was rous'd by the arrival of a courier from my father, with a letter announcing that his dangerous ſtate of health threatened a ſpeedy diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and commanding me to loſe no time in haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home—I had ſcarce courage to tell the tidings to Julietta, who receiv'd them as I expected—<hi>in an agony of grief</hi>—I endeavour'd to ſoothe her by a promiſe of returning ſo ſoon as my father ſhould recover, or I ſhould have cloſed his eyes. Obliged to depart—I gave her that ring as a pledge of my <hi>honour!</hi>—On my arrival in England, I found my father on the recovery, he lingered out ſome years, while I, in vain, ſtrove to deaden reflection by joining the vortex of faſhionable diſſipation. After his death, I became Lord Stanton; the ſettlement of his affairs required my longer ſtay; I finiſhed with all ſpeed—and ſat out, hoping to find my Julietta ſtill alive, and to make her lawful reparation for her injured fame—by <hi>marriage.</hi>

                     <p>The fineneſs of the evening, Sir, A garden is a charming place for meditation; and I was taking a walk to conſider of what you were ſaying to me to-day.</p>

                     <p>To duty, certainly, (<hi>coaxingly</hi>) I did, indeed, heſitate awhile, but when I came to conſider, and put wealth and grandeur into the balance, why—love kick'd the beam.</p>

                     <p>(<hi>aſide</hi>) Deceitful baggage! Well, my dear child, I am glad you have made ſo prudent a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and ſo kind a return to all my regard and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs.

The Sun begins to decline, how ſtrange that his cheering preſence ſhould be diſpleaſing to the eyes of lovers.—I think by this time Latouche muſt be at the place; and if no daemon, envious of true lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's happineſs, comes acroſs us; this might free me, my dear Papa, from every juriſdiction but that of a <hi>husband's!</hi>
