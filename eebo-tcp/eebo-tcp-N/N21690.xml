            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE EPIDEMICAL FEVER, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>WHEN I firſt determined on publiſhing the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent pamphlet, it was my intention to have preſented the Public with a Work not inferior to the one pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by that indefatigable man, and meritorious Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, Mr. Mathew Carey, of Philadelphia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to accompliſh this deſirable object, I applied to ſeveral medical friends to write a Diſſertation upon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, with a ſtatement of ſuch important facts as came within their knowledge, and promiſed to furniſh them with all that I could obtain. In this pleaſing anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, however, I have been much diſappointed, for each and all declined undertaking the buſineſs, for lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal reaſons. I mention this circumſtance as an apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy for my coming forward, I truſt, before an indulgent Public. The great ſatisfaction which many ſtrangers may derive from peruſing an accurate liſt of the deaths, and thereby diſcovering, in a degree, whether or not, their friends and connexions are ſtill living, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced me to procure the ſtatement which is annexed to the Work.</p>
            <p>It is not my intention to hazard any opinion what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, upon the diſeaſe, whether imported or originat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in local cauſes; but ſimply to collect the ſeveral letters and other publications which have appeared on the ſubject, and which I conceive will be found any way intereſting or ſatisfactory to the reader. The proceedings of the Health Committee, the different
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028538_0004_0FD937FDF0338210"/>
letters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are arranged agreeable to the dates on which they appeared.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it may be conſidered a duty incumbent on me to ſay ſomething concerning the ſituation of the city, previous to the introduction or appearance of the diſeaſe: and in theſe remarks, as well as in any others I may have occaſion to offer, I ſhall be as laconic as the nature of the ſubject will permit.</p>
            <p>New York was, doubtleſs, one of the moſt increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and flouriſhing cities in the United States. Some idea may be formed of its rapid population, by remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that in the year 1791 it contained about 4,700 families, and in May 1795 about 9,000. This ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is from the City Directory, which is annually tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. Since the commencement of the preſent war be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween France and the combined deſpots, the neceſſaries of life had progreſſively riſen, till they had arrived at an enormous price, and in many particulars beyond what was ever remembered here before. Such is the effect the war had, and ſtill continues to have on Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, at leaſt this part of it, notwithſtanding our <hi>boaſted neutrality:</hi> What is ſtill more diſtreſſing, the riſe of mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical labour had by no means been equal, or bore a juſt proportion to the former. The one had riſen, in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, an hundred per cent. while the other, generally ſpeaking, had not riſe more than from twenty-five to thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The rent of houſes had alſo nearly doubled, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly thoſe which were ſituated in the moſt public ſtreets.</p>
            <p>Theſe circumſtances rendered it difficult for people in moderate ſtations, to do more than maintain and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their families. The city, however, was faſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing in luxury and pride, thoſe barriers to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and many who conſidered <hi>virtue</hi> and not <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> the ſtrength of a republic, dreaded the future conſequences. Splendor, pomp, and diſſipation, were at a ſhameful height. Money was in great demand: The intereſt frequently given was from two to three per cent a month.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:028538_0005_0FD937FFD30B4E20"/>
In conſequence of the enormous price of rents, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny families, particularly among the Iriſh emigrants, were reduced to the neceſſity of living, or rather exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in damp cellars, and among this claſs of people it will be found that the diſorder was moſt prevalent, and operated moſt powerfully. I believe it may be ſafely aſſerted, that a very large proportion of thoſe, in tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſituations, who had proper medical aid in the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtages of the diſorder, and were regularly attended afterwards, perfectly recovered in the courſe of ten or fifteen days.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed to a few remarks on the general ſymptoms of the diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>"THIS malady, in many inſtances, has been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded by an unuſual flow of ſpirits, though for the moſt part a degree of ſtupor has been obſerved; ſome hours after they are attacked with violent pains in the head, back and loins: The bowels are extremely coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, ſeldom yielding but to powerful purgatives, and the tongue ſoon becomes conſiderably foul. In ſome caſes, the pulſe is ſtrong and tenſe; the countenance fluſhed; the eyes greatly inflamed; the pains more violent, and reſpiration very laborious. In others, and more particularly thoſe of a ſlender habit of body, the pulſe is weak, though frequent; the face rather pale and of a yellowiſh tinge; a conſtant deſire for ſleep; ſoreneſs over the whole ſyſtem, and extreme debility. About the third and fourth days the ſymptoms become more violent; the tongue is dry and covered with a black ſcurf; the appetite greatly impaired; reſpiration more difficult; the pulſe ſcarcely to be diſcerned; ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſtartings, when in a doſe, as though affrighted; a ſenſe of weight around the praecordia; the body more yellow, but particularly the face and breaſt; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities cold; the ſtomach unable to retain its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, and what is thrown up in vomiting, has the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of black coffee grounds; a hemorrhage of the fauces, and frequently a diſcharge of blood with the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028538_0006_0FD9380535C13B00"/>
ſtools, which were now perfectly black; convulſive motions of the ſuperior extremities, and ſhortly death terminated the ſcene. The body now put on every appearance of immediate putrefaction.</p>
            <p>In one perſon whom I had an opportunity of viſiting, attacked in this alarming manner, the lower extremities were almoſt black; the evacuations involuntary; the parts to which bliſters were applied, were ſeemingly mortified; the blood oozed out of every part where it could find vent, and in fact he was a perfect maſs of putrefaction, before the vital functions were ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended<note n="*" place="bottom">MS. Of George Davis.</note>."</p>
            <p>It may not be improper to remark, that a very great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erence of opinion prevailed among the phyſicians, both as to the diſeaſe and the treatment of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Another circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which engaged much of the public attention was the appearance of an advertiſement in the newſpapers, againſt the mode of treating the diſeaſe by the practiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners in general, and challenging them to defend their practice. The author was Mr. Alexander Cuthill, taylor. Which of the parties were right is not my province to determine; but to ſtate facts is my object. In ſome inſtances the doctors poſitively refuſed viſiting a patient who had been ſeen during his indiſpoſition by Mr. Cuthill; and in others diſcontinued their viſits on finding that he alſo came to the houſe where the ſick perſon lay. I leave the public to draw what inference they pleaſe from theſe facts.</p>
            <p>A general opinion has prevailed, among medical cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters in particular, that the preſent epidemic has made its appearance in a greater or leſs degree, among us du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the autumns of the laſt three or four years. That a malignant fever did rage here, during the months of September and Oct. of 1791, is a fact, and on compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſymptoms with thoſe of the preſent diſeaſe, they will be found not diſſimilar. It is worthy of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that the fever in 1791 firſt made its appearance
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028538_0007_0FD93807FB3760C8"/>
within a few yards of the ſpot where it has proved moſt fatal the preſent ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>"About the middle of Auguſt, 1791, a contagious fever appeared in the city of New York, which firſt diſcovered itſelf near Peck ſlip, a part of the city thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inhabited; its houſes generally ſmall, and badly ventulated: many of the inhabitants were in indigent circumſtances, which is a frequent cauſe of the want of cleanlineſs. Here it raged a conſiderable time; it then began to ſpread, as ſome attendants on the ſick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came affected, who lived in other neighbourhoods.—</p>
            <p>By this means it was carried to different families, and moſt generally could be traced from this ſource. It likewiſe proved more particularly fatal near the place where it firſt appeared, than in any other part. Thus, at length it ſpread through the city, until about the middle of October, when the weather growing a little cooler, the diſeaſe greatly abated, and in a ſhort time nearly diſappeared. I have been informed by ſeveral phyſicians of reputation, who reſide and practice in the country, that many of the boatmen who frequented the city from Long Iſland, and the upper part of Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's river, carried the diſeaſe home, where it proved fatal to ſeveral<note n="*" place="bottom">Doctor William Moore, an eminent phyſician of New-York, informed me that a gentleman of Lime, in the ſtate of Connecticut, was on a viſit to this city when he became a patient of his, in whom the diſeaſe was evidently marked, attended with large vibices; he, however recruited conſiderably before he left the city: on his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to Lime he relapſed, and died ſhortly after he reached home. The greater part of his family caught the contagion, and ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came affected with a ſimilar diſeaſe; which proved fatal to his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſome other perſons in the family.</note>.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time in the ſouth weſtern part of the city, an intermittent and remittent fever prevailed, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a few caſes of dyſentery. This cauſed much diſpute among phyſicians as they generally na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the diſeaſe from the caſes which they had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028538_0008_0FD93809A3BBFAD0"/>
of ſeeing moſt prevalent. Some called it a remittent, others billious; ſome typhus, putrid, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant; and others, following Sydenham, <hi>febris, bili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſa remittens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In conſequence of a few caſes terminating ſuddenly fatal, together with the very unjuſt, as well as unge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous judgment of ſome phyſicians, in determining every diſeaſe to be the putrid fever, fear ſpread from mind to mind like a devouring famine, and terror, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently more hideous than the diſeaſe itſelf, wrought on the minds of the credulous and weak. This, in ſome caſes, greatly increaſed the malignity of the fever: in others again, even a ſlight head ache cauſed them to deſpond, and threw them into a ſtate of languor more eaſily conceived than deſcribed; but without the real ſymptoms of the fever. Whether this diagnoſtic was given through ignorance, or as a profeſſional trick, in order to gain applauſe, by making many and ſpeedy cures, is uncertain; however, it was nevertheleſs ſo conſidered. Thus ſome phyſicians obtained a credit in curing the complaint, without poſſeſſing any real merit.</p>
            <p>This diſeaſe, generally, in the firſt place, affected the perſon with a ſenſe of chillineſs, alternating with gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fluſhings and a ſenſe of ſoreneſs of all the muſcles; the face appeared pale, the features ſhrunk, the body weary, as if it had undergone ſome great fatigue, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with yawnings and ſtretchings of the extremities; a diſinclination for any bodily exerciſe; and when any exertion was made, it was attended with ſluggiſhneſs and unweary ſenſations. The pulſe at this time was weak and frequent; the mental faculties were likewiſe impaired, and frequently a ſmall pain in the head, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſighings and anorexy: reſpiration being anxious and rather ſmall at this ſtage of the diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>In ſome caſes the following ſymptoms took place without the patient's knowledge of the former having paſt: they however, in general, preceded, violent pains in the head, back, loins; a pulſe more tenſe, full, and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028538_0009_0FD9380B01644708"/>
ſomething increaſed in fullneſs. (In one caſe the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent compared the pulſation of the temporal arteries, to the ſtriking of a hammer againſt his temples. In ſome a delirium came on immediately after the cold ſtage, ſo that the perſons affected got out of their beds, and wandered about their rooms or houſes. Sometimes nauſea and vomiting appeared early in the diſeaſe, which proved very troubleſome, and greatly debilitated the patient. Reſpiration was now rather laborious than anxious; the ſkin dry and hot, belly moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly coſtive, though ſome had a gentle diarrhoea from the beginning of the diſeaſe; no appetite, but a great deſire for drink, particularly any united with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable acids, as the acid of lemons, &amp;c. the adnatae of the eyes, in ſome, were much inflamed, ſo that the light became ſcarcely tolerable; the countenance, on the firſt and ſecond days, in many, appeared much fluſhed, attended continually with a violent head ache, ſo as frequently to produce delirium, with reſtleſsneſs and watchings, which greatly exhauſted the patient's ſtrength; the tongue was generally dry, and in the beginning of the diſeaſe covered with a whitiſh ſcurf, and the patient complained much of anxiety, or a great ſenſe of weight at the praecordia; the excrementitious diſcharges, whether natural, or produced by art, were very fetid and diſagreeable.</p>
            <p>About the third day the inflammatory ſymptoms greatly changed to thoſe of a putrid kind, or a remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion took place; if the latter did not ſucceed, the tongue became dry, and began to be covered with brown or black <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ordes; not long after the teeth and lips put on the ſame appearance; reſpiration became now anxious, with an increaſed proſtration of ſtrength: the vital functions at this time were much more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed; watching, or a comatoſe ſtate, now took place, if it had not before appeared; and even thoſe who did ſleep, enjoyed it but for a few moments, when they waked as if in a fright: the pulſe became
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028538_0010_0FD9380EF6BC2948"/>
ſmaller, weaker, and more frequent; thirſt was greatly increaſed; nauſea much more intolerable, together with the ſenſe of oppreſſion at the ſtomach: thoſe who had not vomited before, had that direful ſymptom added now to the others; the contents of the ſtomach, which were thrown up in the act of vomiting, were generally of a fetid nature; the voice began to be changed; ſmall petechiae appeared about the neck and breaſt, when the body, and even the room, unleſs well ventulated, had a cardaverous ſmell. The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient kept continually rolling or turning in the bed, and frequently picking the bed-clothes. In ſome, the bowels, at this ſtage of the diſeaſe, were very coſtive, ſo that recourſe was obliged to be had to artificial means, whenever it became neceſſary to evacuate their contents: in others, a profuſe diarrhoea conſiderably increaſed the weakneſs of their debilitated bodies. Moſt generally on the fourth or fifth day of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, with thoſe to whom it proved fatal, all the laſt mentioned ſymptoms were greatly increaſed, together with a cardaverous ſmelling ſweat, which would appear on the body, when the trunk was hot, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities cold: the pulſe became more frequent, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, and ſometimes intermittent: the perſon would lay on his back, with his knees drawn up, and his body appearing as if falling down in the bed; his voice low, and ſcarcely perceptible: he was now ſenſeleſs of perſons ſtanding around, or any of their proceedings: the pulſe in this ſtage of the diſeaſe was ſo weak as ſcarcely to be felt; the extremities put on a livid appearance. From the comatoſe ſtate, which had already taken place, the patient could hardly be rouſed by the ſtrongeſt ſtimuli of ſound and light, though in the beginning of the diſeaſe he was ſcarcely able to bear the moſt gentle; and if he ſhould be rouſed from the ſituation, in a few moments the ſame would again ſucceed. The urine and ſtools were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently involuntarily diſcharged; a hiccup followed,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028538_0011_0FD9381064F0F090"/>
if it had not before taken place; and the perſon, in conſequence of univerſal debility producing inability to diſcharge the natural ſecretion in the bronchial veſſels, appeared as if choaking with phlegm, or ſomething pent up in the trachea: convulſions, or ſubſultus ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinum, now affected the frame; the eyes put on a glaſſy appearance, and death, in a ſhort time, cloſed the ſcene.</p>
            <p>This was the general courſe of the ſymptoms in thoſe to whom the diſeaſe proved fatal; but in ſome, they came on a little ſooner, in others later: in ſome the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiae, and even maculae and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ices, extended over the body before death, though all ſhewed evident ſigns of putreſcency directly after.</p>
            <p>In one perſon, on the afternoon of the ſecond day, an entire intermiſſion of his ſymptoms took place; on the morning of the third, they returned with increaſed violence, when a vomiting came on with apthae appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the mouth and fauces. Upon taking a few drops of any thing in the ſtomach, vomiting would immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately be produced, which terminated in hiccup; this continued a few minutes; it would then ſubſide until any thing was again ſwallowed, when the ſame cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances returned. Petechia appeared on his neck and breaſt the fifth day, and as nothing could be retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on his ſtomach, he was ſupported with glyſters of broth for ſeveral days, to which, as there was no other way of adminiſtering it, the red bark was added. The pulſe in this perſon remained good, until within a few hours of his death, when it began to diminiſh, weaken and become intermittent. From this time it was remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any thing would remain on his ſtomach; the hiccup ceaſed, and death in a few hours cloſed the ſcene. This was on the morning of the ſeventh day.</p>
            <p>In ſome the diſeaſe made its appearance in a more gradual manner, without any inflammatory ſymptoms attending it, and moſt commonly thoſe were protracted beyond the eleventh or fourteenth days, when a remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028538_0012_0FD93816637047E8"/>
or intermiſſion took place, or the perſon ſunk un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the diſeaſe. There were ſome who recovered, as well as thoſe who periſhed, on whom petechial eruptions appeared; and the ſtomach in many of thoſe who ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived was very much diſordered.</p>
            <p>Some had other accidental ſymptoms accompanying the diſeaſe, ſuch as a dry ickling cough, pains in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent parts of the thorax, twith other catarrhal and pneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monic ſymptoms; ſo that ſome phyſicians were induced to declare it a ſimple inflammatory fever and treat it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. In other patients a billious yellowneſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared over the ſurface of the body, the veſſels in the adnatae of the eyes were filled with bile, and attended with the other ſymptoms of Dr. Cullen's ſpecies of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus, the icteroides.</p>
            <p>Many of thoſe who ſurvived the diſeaſe were a long time troubled with rheumatic pains of a chronic nature, or a ſmall eruption over the ſurface of their bodies, which ſeemed to be cauſed by the debilitated ſtate in which the diſeaſe had left them; and the eruption ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to depend particularly on a weakened action of the extreme veſſels<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Addoms's diſſertation on the malignant fever which prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the city of New-York during the months Aug. Sept. and Oct. 1791.</note>."</p>
            <p>I have thought proper to quote the preceding account of the fever which prevailed here in 1791, from Dr. J. S. Addoms' diſſertation; and ſhall now return to the object of this publication.</p>
            <p>In Philadelphia, "It was ſome time before the diſorder attracted public notice<note n="§" place="bottom">Mathew Carey.</note>;" very oppoſite was the caſe in New York, for before the complaint made any progreſs whatever, the Health Committee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the diſcharge of their duty. The firſt death which created alarm was that of Dr. M. Treat, Health officer of the port, on the 29th of July. By ſome it is believed he took the infection by viſiting a veſſel
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028538_0013_0FD938183B0A6910"/>
from the Weſt Indies, having a malignant fever on board; by others (phyſicians) it is poſitively aſſerted that he did not die of an imported diſorder; but by all, I believe, it is allowed that he died of the epidemic which has ſince proved ſo fatal to many.</p>
            <p>The diſorder firſt made its appearance in July, at the upper end of Water ſtreet, near New ſlip, and here it continued for a very conſiderable time, not ſpreading out of that ſtreet, a few inſtances excepted, until the month of September, after which, in ſome degree, it prevailed throughout the city; but ultimately proved moſt mortal in the ſtreet where it commenced. Near New ſlip there had recently been opened a ſmall ſtreet, called George ſtreet; it had been much neglected; was very filthy, and principally inhabited by people in indigent circumſtances; not leſs than ſixty perſons were buried out of it, within the ſmall compaſs of twenty houſes. The diſeaſe alſo proved very fatal about the Fly market, and from thence, in Water ſtreet, to the Coffee houſe. The alarm became pretty general in the beginning of September, and the citizens at that period commenced removing into the country. The recent ſufferings of Philadelphia and Baltimore, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned a greater fear of infectious fevers than would otherwiſe, probably, have exiſted. The haſty burials after death, was alſo a cauſe of great <hi>dread;</hi> the mode was no leſs terrifying: For the ſpeedy removal of the dead, a hearſe was provided, drawn by an horſe, and attended by two men. As ſoon as the breath was out of the body, theſe men were ſent for; they uſually brought a coffin and tarred ſheet with them, in which the corpſe was wrapped, put into the coffin, and drove off to Potter's Field, a place purchaſed for the burial of ſtrangers and the poor, and entered without the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance of ſingle connexion or friend to bemoan their loſs. It is aſſerted, and doubtleſs is a fact, that in many inſtances the hearſe came for the ſick, while yet living, and that coffins have been in the houſe for ſome
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028538_0014_0FD9381982B154C0"/>
hours before the death of the perſons for whom they were deſtined. No excuſe can be plead for ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, but the general conſternation which prevailed.</p>
            <p>The fever itſelf did not, in many inſtances, occaſion more alarm than the hearſe; as a proof of this many caſes might be enumerated of women fainting away at the ſight of it, and being ſometime before they perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recovered; and in others it has occaſioned hyſteria, and a fever ſucceeded. One ſtriking inſtance of the effect of fear, and which came within my own knowledge, was in a young woman who for ſome days dreaded the diſeaſe: at length ſhe was ſeized with it, and a delirium in a day or two enſued; during the whole of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition, which was five or ſix days, ſhe conſtantly complained againſt the hearſe and tarred ſheet, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt her laſt requeſt when dying, was, that the family would not ſuffer her to be buried in this manner.</p>
            <p>About the middle of September, ſome perſons, by what authority I know not, undertook burning tar one night in the ſtreets: This became a topic of converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and among thoſe of weak minds increaſed the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm: in ſhort, a coincidence of circumſtances like theſe doubtleſs operated to the diſadvantage of the city, as the rumour ſpread through the country, much exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and thereby, in many inſtances prevented ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies from coming into town.</p>
            <p>The ſufferings of the poor were great; a Lazaretto was prepared for their reception, and a phyſician and nurſes appointed to attend them: but unfortunately great prejudices prevailed againſt it, and many were of an opinion that the patients did not receive proper at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, particularly from the nurſes: as I have not been able at this early period, to procure ſatisfactory documents on the ſubject, I ſhall ſuſpend any animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions.</p>
            <p>"The Lazaretto, or peſt-houſe at Belle Vue, a few miles from New York, on the Eaſt River, has, though a healthy place, and under good regulations, been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028538_0015_0FD9381D38981538"/>
by the people at large, <hi>as the houſe of death.</hi>—So odious is the very idea of being placed there, that there is high probability the objection of mind atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant upon their getting into new quarters, and the anxiety and fatigue conſequent upon being moved thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, have contributed, in ſeveral inſtances, to leſſen their chance of recovery.</p>
            <p>The governors of the City Hoſpital gave directions, in purſuance of there being a Lazaretto provided for thoſe ſick of the yellow fever, that no caſe, ſuppoſed to be of that, or any other infectious diſeaſe, ſhould be admitted into that charity. It was reported that ſeveral poor perſons, who had been recommended as patients to the Hoſpital, were conſidered by the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians as improper, by reaſon of ſuſpected contagion, to be admitted into the houſe. In conſequence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection there, it has happened that men, like calves and other live ſtock, have been put upon carts at the Hoſpital, and drawn thence in ſucceſſion to the doors of ſeveral of the members of the Health Committee, over the ſtony roughneſs of the pavement, and under the ſcorching rays of a noon-tide fun! a procedure which ſtirred up indignation, as well as alarm, in the citizens who ſaw it.</p>
            <p>The general anxiety, cauſed by a concurrence of fearful circumſtances, operated ſo powerfully upon many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whoſe children were ſtudents of Columbia College that applications for leave of abſence, in order to remove to the country, became very frequent. The ſtudents participated the alarm of their parents and guardians, and became intent on departing. The greater part diſcontinued their attendance on the lectures, by direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their friends, and the reſt withdrew themſelves by degrees, ſo that in a few days nobody appeared on the ringing of the bell, and the profeſſors gave up their labours of tuition. There was never any formal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journment of the College. The prevailing ſentiment
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028538_0016_0FD9381E88E563B8"/>
of the board of profeſſors was, "That no ſuch thing ought to take place, as not warranted by any real cauſe of alarm."</p>
            <p>Much praiſe is due to the Health Committee for their attention to the diſtreſſes of the poor, and it is not to be doubted, but ſome valuable citizens were ſnatched from the jaws of death by their timely aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Mr. Frederick Steymets, a member of this body, fell a victim to the diſeaſe, much lamented by all who knew him. His attention in the diſcharge of his duty was unlimited, and it is expected, will ever be remembered with gratitude by all good citizens. Capt. Buchanan, who voluntarily offered his ſervices to viſit the ſick, and diſtribute ſuch monies as were put into his hands by the Committee, alſo died of the epidemic: It is only neceſſary to remark that this worthy man fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his duty with promptitude, and that he afforded the poor and indigent all the conſolation and relief that was in his power; ſociety has loſt in him a valuable mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. There are many more whoſe ſervices have been of equal importance with thoſe already enumerated; but among theſe I ſhall name one man only; a man who ſacrificed every kind of intereſt to aſſiſt and relieve the diſtreſſed, and whoſe philanthrophy it is hoped will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be forgotten. I refer to Mr. Levi Wayland; to enumerate his virtues would require more time than can be well ſpared; I ſhall therefore only remark that he was a good citizen, and a ſincere friend: He died of the epidemic, in the 31ſt, year of his age, on the 12th, of October.</p>
            <p>Having given a ſketch of the principle occurrences that took place during the months of Auguſt, Sept. and Oct. I ſhall next proceed to arrange the proclamations, letters, &amp;c. of the governor, Health Committee, &amp;c.</p>

to the ſpread of any malignant diſeaſe, but at the ſame time convinced of the neceſſity of a faithful detail of facts, as far as they have come to their knowledge. When the public is addreſſed on this ſubject, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte of Health think proper to declare, that in their opinion, no circumſtance has exiſted in this city which ought to have occaſioned the alarm which is ſaid to have gone forth. It is true that a fever preciſely like one which has twice, in the courſe of four or five years been obſerved, in the autumnal ſeaſons, in this place, has a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain made its appearance. Some ſea-faring men have fallen victims to it. It is ſuſpected to have originated on board a certain veſſel which lay at Fitche's wharf, but of this there can be obtained no decided evidence. Notwithſtanding which, the veſſel has been ordered off in the ſtream. It is ſuſpected alſo, but without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided evidence, that our late worthy health officer fell a victim to ſome unguarded expoſure, to an infected corpſe on board a veſſel. Beſides him, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt diligent enquiry, we have obtained infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of not more than eight deaths happening among our citizens ſince the 20th of laſt month, from fevers, ſuppoſed in any degree malignant. The number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons killed by the imprudent uſe of cold water, has been remarkable, and labourers and others actively employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ought to be frequently cautioned on this head. The Committee have taken the moſt prompt and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual meaſures to guard the health of their fellow citizens; a houſe is prepared at Belle Vue for the reception of ſick perſons, who may be ſuſpected of infection, with very agreeable accomodations, ſubſiſtence, and medical aid.</p>
                        <p>All veſſels coming from Foreign countries, from which there is any reaſon to apprehend the introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of infectious fevers, are now obliged to remain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Governor's Iſland, until viſited by the health offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, and a regular permit for their entry be granted. The citizens ought to conſider it their duty individually to report to the committee, any perſon who may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:028538_0018_0FD9382548ED85C0"/>
to evade this precaution, that the penalty of the law may be enforced. The practitioners of phyſic in the city, have been particularly requeſted to be early and faithful in reporting any dangerous or ſuſpicious caſe. A hearſe is provided, and may be readily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by an application to the chairman of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, or any one of the aldermen, for the early buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of the dead, whenever it ſhall be thought neceſſary, a practice earneſtly recommended during the hotteſt ſeaſon, it being a well eſtabliſhed fact, that the body of a patient who during life could give no infection, may yet, when a corps, be ſuddenly rendered capable of ſo doing in a great degree. The Committee are of opinion, from taking into their conſideration, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of the health of the city, the uncommon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of heat in the weather, and the lengthy period it is yet to elapſe, before the ſeaſon arrives which is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally obſerved to check the progreſs of autumnal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, that great care and circumſpection are neceſſary. Moderation, regularity and cleanlineſs, are eſpecially recommended.</p>
                        <p>The cleanlineſs of the ſtreets, yards, cellars and markets, and the removal of all putreſcent matter, are objects of very great importance, and ought to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly attended to, eſpecially in thoſe parts of the city, which are contiguous to our Eaſtern waters.</p>

<pb n="28" facs="unknown:028538_0026_0FD9383A426D2B88"/>
in the execution of their truſt, it was not only thought the moſt prudent (becauſe the moſt ſilent) but it was viewed and intended to be as reſpectful a mode of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting them as any that could be deviſed. It is, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with ſome aſtoniſhment, as well as ſincere regret, they hear that <hi>many if not moſt,</hi> of the medical charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this city have been ſo far offended at this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure, as actually to reſolve to withhold the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and advice they have ſolicited, and which is ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to their ſucceſsful endeavours to ſerve their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low citizens.</p>
                        <p>If this information is juſt, they preſume it muſt be founded on a miſtaken opinion, that it was the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Committee indelicately to interfere with the attending phyſician in the examination or management of his patient—a conduct which they have ſtudiouſly avoided, and of which they believe no inſtance can be produced, where the attending phyſician himſelf has given them the neceſſary information: but where this information has been withheld, and they have received from other quarters, well atteſted accounts of a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous caſe, as the only means of information in their power, they have been conſtrained to ſend and make the neceſſary enquiry, that they might at leaſt ſave their fellow citizens from the danger which in ſuch caſes would attend a procraſtinated funeral, and the neglect of proper precaution reſpecting the bedding, cloathing and chambers of the ſick, and this explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will, they make no doubt, with any candid man, acquit them of the charge of inattention or diſreſpect. But if the information they have received is founded rather in the peculiar ſenſibility of individuals, than in the impreſſion their conduct has made on the minds of medical gentlemen in general, then it expoſes the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to the unmerited cenſure of having ſuffered too punctillious an attention to etiqutte to have interfered with an important and eſſential duty.</p>
                        <p>At any rate, however, it is now, as it ever has been,

the unanimous wiſh of the Committee, cordially to unite with the medical gentlemen in their endeavours to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert or leſſen the misfortunes with which this city is threatened, and to avail themſelves of their united counſel and information; they therefore have directed me to addreſs to you this letter, and to requeſt you will communicate it to the ſociety, over which you preſide; that no miſunderſtanding or trifling punctilio may leſſen their utility, or in any wiſe defeat their exertions, in the truly important objects of this inſtitution.</p>

alarm of the public, and an infraction of the laws of hoſpitality, and the ſocial compact, without drawing the attention of the citizens to the real ſources of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                        <p>How far this implication may have been applicable to ſome medical characters in this city, is not for them to inveſtigate; but they conceive it a duty they owe to themſelves and to the public, to aſſure you, that no ſuch diſpoſitions are to be found in their body; on the contrary, they have individually, after the receipt of your firſt letter, communicated all the information, as well as all the caſes of a dangerous nature, to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, which they judged neceſſary and proper for them to know, in order for your making the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per arrangements for the preſervation of the public health, and the alleviation of the misfortunes of thoſe of the poor, or others who might ſuffer dangerous ſickneſs.</p>
                        <p>They ſincerely hope that ſuch enquiries as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee may deem expedient to be made, will on all fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture occaſions be conducted with ſuch candor, deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, and unequivocal information, as may not be inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the patient, diſreſpectful to the phyſician, or lead to any unjuſtifiable alarm of the public mind, at the ſame time preſerve the dignity of the Committee.</p>
                        <p>They are happy, on all occaſions, to avoid all thoſe quarrels and diſputes which have ſo long diſgraeed the Faculty of Phyſic of New York, and therefore it is deemed highly inexpedient to enter into any theoreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal account of the preſent ſickneſs. But from all the facts that have occurred under their obſervation, they are not yet convinced that there is any thing eſſentially different in the diſeaſe, now exciting ſuch general alarm, from what has been commonly obſervable at this ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the year.</p>
                        <p>They believe, and are compelled to obſerve, that the meaſures recommended by the ſaid Dean, relative to the arrangements of Belle Vue hoſpital, the viſitation
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:028538_0029_0FD93844C3C1C6D8"/>
of the unfortunate patients, the interment of the dead, and ſeveral other particulars are of ſuch a nature, as are highly intereſting to the reputation of this city; and it now becomes a ſerious queſtion, whether it would not be wiſe and prudent in the Committee to adopt new and more ſalutary meaſures.</p>
                        <p>They cannot but hold in abhorrence every attempt at dictatorial uſurpation; that there is not a member of their body who has not been regularly licenſed as the law directs, and they flatter themſelves that they are duly ſenſible of the ſacred nature of thoſe obligations, which ought to govern their conduct as practitioners; and at the ſame time they feel it an important and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential duty to countenance every man or body of men, labouring for the public good.</p>
                        <p>They alſo find it neceſſary further to remark, that there are no points of "etiquette," as you are pleaſed to term them, which have ever been ſuffered to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere "with an important and eſſential duty."</p>
                        <p>They moſt ſincerely wiſh, "that no miſunderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or trifling punctillio," may leſſen the public utility of either inſtitution, by obſtructing the channel of truth, but at the ſame time they think proper to ſuggeſt the propriety there would be in recommending to the medical department, annexed to your body, a more cautious expreſſion of language on the nature of the ſuppoſed prevailing epidemic; by theſe means the alarm will not be increaſed from the ſource of oſtenſible au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
                        <p>They alſo aſſure the Committee of their readineſs on all occaſions, cordially and unanimouſly to unite with the Committee of Health, in their endeavours to avert or leſſen the misfortunes with which this city may at any time be threatened, by epidemics or other dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous diſeaſes.</p>
                        <p>I am, therefore, directed to addreſs to you this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to requeſt you to communicate it to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, in which you have the honor to preſide, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt

                        <p>Your Excellency's proclamation of the 31ſt of laſt month, prohibiting all intercourſe between this city and Philadelphia, induced me to write the following letters to the Preſident of the Medical Society in this city.</p>

                              <p>By a proclamation of the governor of Pennſylvania, dated the 31ſt day of laſt month, all intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this city and Philadelphia is prohibited for the term of one month, or until that prohibition ſhall be revoked.</p>
                              <p>The reaſon aſſigned for this prohibition is thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the proclamation—Whereas the Board of
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:028538_0032_0FD9385091385B10"/>
Inſpectors of the Health Office of Philadelphia, have reported to me, that it appears from authentic informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them exhibited, that an infectious or contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſeaſe exiſts in the city of New York, in the State of New York, and that there is reaſon to believe that a ſimilar diſeaſe exiſts in the town of Norfolk, in the State of Virginia, ſo that the ſafety and health of the citizens of Pennſylvania require a ſtoppage of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the ſaid infected places, Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
                              <p>This proclamation, by exciting alarms and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions throughout this and the neighbouring ſtates, and in foreign countries, naturally tends to produce embarraſſments to the commerce of this city; and to interrupt that intercourſe with the country which is at all times neceſſary to the convenience and intereſts of both. Hence it becomes important to examine and aſcertain with preciſion, whether any and what degree of credit is due to the information alluded to in the abovementioned report of the inſpectors of the Health Office of Philadelphia. No infectious or contagious diſeaſe can exiſt and prevail in this city, without the knowledge of the gentlemen who practice phyſic in it; and as the greater part of them are members of the Medical Society over which you preſide, I requeſt the favour of you to ſummon a meeting of the ſociety, and to lay before them this letter.</p>
                              <p>They will oblige me by reporting to me an accurate ſtatement of ſuch facts and obſervations as may in their opinion be neceſſary to the forming a right judgment relative to the exiſtence, nature, and extent of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe in queſtion.</p>
                              <p>If ſuch a diſeaſe does really exiſt and prevail here, it ſhould candidly be admitted and made known, that the dangers reſulting from it may be guarded againſt. If, on the contrary, the reports concerning it are ill founded, care ſhould be taken to prevent their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to gain credit.</p>
                              <p>Although the truth of the frequent reports made and
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:028538_0033_0FD9385180CA4D10"/>
publiſhed by the Health Committee has not been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached, yet as the before mentioned proclamation appears to be grounded on information more alarming than what thoſe reports afford, I think it adviſable to enquire whether it is warranted by any facts within the knowledge of the members of your ſociety.</p>

                              <p>THE communication which you were pleaſed (through our Preſident) laſt evening to lay before the Medical Society, we conſider of a nature the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and important, and the information you deſire we offer with great reſpect, and under impreſſions the moſt ſcrupulouſly conſcientious.</p>
                              <p>About ſix weeks ago, in a particular part of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, being very low, and having an eaſtern expoſure, a fever has been obſerved to exiſt, marked by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of thoſe ſymptoms which are acknowledged to characteriſe thoſe of the malignant ſort. This fever, in a ſhort time, attacked a conſiderable number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in proportion to the ſpace which it occupied, and proved fatal to more than is uſual with us, and which (previous to the ſalutary and heavy rains we have late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had, and the conſequent cloudy and cool weather) aſſumed an aſpect which called for, and juſtified every prudent exertion that could be made to inveſtigate its origin, and check its progreſs.</p>
                              <p>Unfortunately, however, the ſenſibility of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic mind, on a ſubject of this nature, giving reality to apprehenſion, converted the neceſſary efforts for ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and prevention into ſources of fear and terror. Hence probably have ariſen moſt of the exaggerated reports which at firſt alarmed our own citizens, and
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:028538_0034_0FD9385207E3CA68"/>
being ſent abroad, have excited the apprehenſions of our neighbours, and given origin to meaſures more timid as they reſpect themſelves, and more injurious to us, than the nature of the caſe in any wiſe juſtified.</p>
                              <p>The collective opinion of this ſociety, as the reſult of attentive obſervation is—With regard to the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious nature of this diſeaſe, moſt of the members are of opinion that it is not contagious, and all agree that it is ſo little ſo, as to afford no apprehenſion of its being communicated from man to man, out of the ſphere of its original and local atmoſphere.</p>
                              <p>As to its origin, ſuſpicions have been entertained by a few phyſicians, that it may have been imported, whilſt at the ſame time there are many among us who conſider it as little more than that ſpecies of fever which has more or leſs prevailed in this city at the ſame ſeaſon, for ſeveral years paſt, rendered, by the extraordinary heat, and ſome local ſources of malignity, more violent and fatal than uſual.</p>
                              <p>If the Board of Inſpectors of the Health Office of Philadelphia have received any information reſpecting the diſeaſe in queſtion, other than that from the Health Committee of this city, which they deemed <hi>authentic,</hi> we are extremely ſorry that they ſhould have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by it, from a perſuaſion that ſuch information was equally unfounded as unauthoriſed.</p>
                              <p>We aſſure your excellency that we have no diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to diſguiſe or conceal facts, nor do we heſitate to declare our opinion, that the alarm which has gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, has been unreaſonably great, and quite diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate to the actual ſtate of the diſeaſe, which, as we have already obſerved, has been confined to a very inconſiderable portion of the city. It affords us great pleaſure to be able to inform your excellency, that this complaint is faſt diminiſhing, and that the general health of our city has been throughout the ſummer, and continues at this moment, unuſually good.</p>

                                    <p>In anſwer to your excellency's letter of the 6th inſt. requiring from us a particular and circumſtantial ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch facts, relative to the diſeaſe which has lately made its appearance in this city, or have come to our knowledge. We beg leave to ſubmit the following.</p>
                                    <p>On the 20th day of July, Dr. Malachi Treat, the late health officer of this port, viſited the brig Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyr from Port-au-Prince, on board of which he found three perſons ill of fever, and the corpſe of one that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that morning. The Doctor calls the fever in his report a billious remitting fever. The brig was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ride quarantine. On the 22d day of July. Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor Treat was taken ill, and died on the 30th of a fever marked by a yellow ſkin, hemorrhages, vomiting of a black matter, reſembling coffee grounds, and all ſuch ſymptoms as characteriſe billious fevers of the malignant kind. On the 25th day of July, four perſons from on board the ſhip William from Liverpool, which arrived here ſeveral weeks before (all the crew having, previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to that day, and during the voyage, been perfectly healthy) were taken ill of fever, attended with ſimilar ſymptoms, and all died within ſeven days.</p>
                                    <p>
                                       <pb n="39" facs="unknown:028538_0037_0FD9385CE5EC57F0"/>
The ſhip lay at a wharf at the foot of Dover ſtreet, in the ſouth eaſterly part of this city, which lies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly low, is much of it made ground, has an eaſtern expoſure, and (from the ſtreets having been raiſed about three years ago, which threw the yards and lots into hollows of conſiderable depth) is almoſt unavoidably liable to great collections of offal and filth of all kinds; is a part of the town very much crouded by poor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and contains a great number of lodging houſes in which ſeamen and ſtrangers of the poorer claſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly reſide: and from all theſe cauſes, is unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably the moſt unhealthy part of this city; and ever has ſuffered moſt from the regular autumnal diſeaſes as well as from any new and uncommon complaint. From all which circumſtances, we entertain no doubt, but that the ſeaman of the ſhip William contracted the diſeaſe of which they died here, and did not introduce it into this city. A little before, and immediately after the attack of the ſeamen of the ſhip William, which firſt called the attention of this Committee, ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſons in Water and Front ſtreets, and in the neighbourhood of Dover ſtreet, were ſeized with fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which eſpecially in thoſe caſes which proved mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, was marked by ſevere vomitings, a yellow ſkin, hemorrhages, and in ſome caſes a vomiting black mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reſembling coffee grounds, and which generallly ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated within ſeven days; and proved fatal to more in proportion to the number ſeized, than is uſual in the ordinary complaints of this ſeaſon, in this city.</p>
                                    <p>From that time the diſeaſe continued to ſpread in that neighbourhood, extending itſelf to a few houſes lower down towards Peck's ſlip, to one or two in Pearl ſtreet and Cherry ſtreet, but principally upwards, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſhip yards; the number of deaths increaſing ſlowly until the 9th of Auguſt, from which, to the 11th incluſive, thirteen died; from that day the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of deaths reported to us have gradually decreaſed, ſo that nine only are reported to have died within the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:028538_0038_0FD938604C56B100"/>
laſt five days; and in all, from the 30th of July to this day, eighty-nine deaths have been reported to this Committee: forty-four perſons in all have been ſent to Belle Vue Hoſpital, of which the greateſt number have been ſeamen and ſtrangers, who have arrived in this city, ſick of various complaints, and of this number, ſeveral in the very laſt ſtages of their diſeaſe; twenty have died; ſixteen have been diſcharged cured, and eight remains in the houſe, moſt of them convaleſcent.</p>
                                    <p>The number of deaths includes all the caſes which to our knowledge have happened between the 26th of July and the 7th of September incluſive, either in this city, at the New York hoſpital, or at the hoſpital at Belle Vue, ariſing from fever in the leaſt approaching to the character of this diſeaſe.</p>
                                    <p>And as this Committee have made every exertion in their power to obtain the neceſſary information, they do not heſitate to ſay, that this ſtatement is ſufficiently correct to afford the baſis of every public meaſure, which may be thought neceſſary for our own ſafety, or for the ſecurity of our neighbours.</p>

                              <p>The ſuſpenſion of all intercourſe between this city and Philadelphia is inconvenient to them, as well as injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to us. The information which induced their Health Office to apply to their governor for this ſuſpenſion, was doubtleſs ſuch as in their opinion juſtified that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. There nevertheleſs is reaſon to believe that more credit was inadvertently given to it, than it deſerved.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="41" facs="unknown:028538_0039_0FD9386442A1A520"/>
Whether a contagious diſeaſe does exiſt and prevail in this city, is a queſtion to which a ſatisfactory an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer can only be formed from correct ſtatements of well authenticated facts, and the opinions of men well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and meriting confidence.</p>
                              <p>On the preſent occaſion, I think it adviſeable to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch ſtatements and opinions, and to tranſmit them to the governor of Pennſylvania.</p>
                              <p>If it ſhould appear from them that the uſual inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between this city and Philadelphia may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored without any danger to the latter, the prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which ſuſpends it, will of courſe be revoked.</p>
                              <p>I have requeſted and received from the Medical So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety in this city their report on this ſubject, and when to this is added the late publication of the Medical gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen who compoſe the ſociety called the College of Phyſicians, the ſentiments of the faculty relative to it will be aſcertained.</p>
                              <p>As the Common Council of the city is compoſed of magiſtrates and other members from the different wards and as a dangerous infectious diſtemper cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to prevail here, without exciting their notice and attention; I requeſt from them a ſtatement of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation as they may poſſeſs, together with their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion relative to this intereſting ſubject.</p>
                              <p>Theſe documents, with the report of the Health Committee, will afford to the governor of Pennſylvania the beſt and moſt authentic evidence that the nature of the caſe will admit of; and ſuch as cannot fail to reduce the many exaggerated reports that are in circulation, to the ſtandard of truth.</p>

                        <p>On the receipt of your excellency's letter of the 9th inſt. I referred the ſtatement, which it contains to the conſideration of the Board of inſpectors and the Board of Phyſicians, appointed by law, to prevent the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of infectious diſeaſes into this commonwealth; and I have now the honor to incloſe copies of my letter and their report for your information.</p>
                        <p>It is a ſource of ſincere regret to every citizen of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia, that the recent intelligence from New York renders the exiſtence of a contagious diſeaſe in that ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty no longer a matter of doubt or apprehenſion. We are confident, therefore, that while we cheriſh every ſentiment of a juſt and liberal ſympathy, the citizens of New York cannot diſapprove our uſing thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions, which are neceſſary to prevent the extenſion of ſo great a calmity. It could certainly be no allevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their ſufferings, that the inhabitants of Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia ſhould be expoſed to the ſame affliction; and your excellency will readily allow, that every embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſment, as well foreign as domeſtic, that may be the effect of a ſuſpenſion of the intercourſe between the two cities, will operate equally againſt both. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of intereſt as well as every motive of duty, juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and humanity, will prompt me to ſeize the earlieſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in which the prohibition contained in my proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be ſafely revoked; and I ſhall eſteem any informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that your excellency may be pleaſed from time to time

                        </opener>
                        <p>In our communication to your excellency of the 4th inſt. we had the honor to inform you, that the inſpectors of the Health Office propoſed a further joint meeting with the Board of conſulting phyſicians, on the Wedneſday following; We accordingly met this day; the reſult of our conſultations we have now to detail to your excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency. And firſt we ſhall notice the following paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in your letter. "That governor Jay may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed of the facts on which your opinions and reports have been founded, you will be pleaſed to furniſh me with a particular ſtatement, to accompany my anſwer to his letter."</p>
                        <p>Previouſly to our adviſing the intercourſe between the two cities to be ſtopped, we have received informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by a number of oral and written teſtimonies, that a dangerous and malignant fever exiſted in the city of New York. It will hardly be expected we ſhould mention the names of thoſe perſons from whom we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived information, either verbal or written; to give up the names of thoſe we converſed with on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject could anſwer no good purpoſe: and in reſpect to
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:028538_0044_0FD93871271BCF70"/>
mentioning the writers of letters, or extracts of letters, from whom we derived a conſiderable ſhare of information, would we conceive be an uſeleſs as well as unpardonable breach of confidence. Suffice it to ſay, the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſuch as on which we conceived we could ſafely depend, and in this body of evidence it may not be amiſs to mention it compriſed the reports of the Health Committee of New York, and letters from their port phyſician.</p>
                        <p>Theſe united teſtimonies tended to eſtabliſh that the late Health Officer of the port, Dr. Treat, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly reſided in a healthy part of the city, on the 20th of July viſited the brig Zephyr, juſt arrived from Port an Prince, on board of whom was the corpſe of a man who had died that day, as alſo three perſons ſick of a fever, all three of whom died in a few days after; that Dr. Treat was taken ill about the 2<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>d, and died on or about the 30th of the ſame month, of a fever; the ſymptoms of which was of the moſt malignant kind, and ſuch as is characteriſtic of what is commonly called the yellow fever; that ſhortly after the part of the crew of the ſhip William from Liverpool were taken with a fever apparently of the ſame nature, and all died (in a ſtatement ſince made by the Health Committee of New York and communicated to your excellency by governor Jay, we have to lament the omiſſion of a moſt material circumſtance; it is whether or not the brig Zephyr had any communication with the William; they only tell us ſhe was ordered to perform quaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine) our private information goes to ſhew that there actually was a communication between thoſe veſſels; if this information is well founded, the contagion may be readily traced from the Zephyr to the William.</p>
                        <p>From about this time a fever of the ſame nature with that of which Doctor Treat and part of the crews of theſe veſſels died, was obſerved to break out in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular diſtrict of that city, confined within a ſmall ſpace and continuing to increaſe inſomuch that in the courſe
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:028538_0045_0FD938750BE63FD8"/>
of the month of Auguſt we are told about eighty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (ſome augment this number greatly) died of the ſame kind of fever within that diſtrict only: if this ſtatement may be depended on, and we think it corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borated by the documents tranſmitted by governor Jay, we have no heſitation in ſaying, that the citizens of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia had cauſe for ſerious alarm, for it is much doubted if a greater number died in Philadelphia du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſame month, of the diſorder which prevailed in, and afterwards proved ſo calamitous to our city, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſummer and autumn of 1793.</p>
                        <p>In both cities the diſorder appears to have broke out about the ſame time of the year, and is remarkable for a ſimilarity of progreſs, except that in the preſent month it has as yet leſs ſpread over the city of New York than it did with us: but may not this be aſcribed to the plentifully rains, a cool and favorable ſtate of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere and other natural cauſes which have prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this ſeaſon in a remarkable degree (the reverſe of which was the caſe in the ſummer of 1793) than to a leſs degree of malignancy in the diſorder: beſides if the conſtitutions and habits of the citizens of New-York are indiſpoſed to imbibe the infection, are we ſure the Philadelphians are not prediſpoſed to take it, and would it become us as guardians of the city's health to try the experiment for the ſake of conviction: rather would it not be more prudent to make uſe of every reaſonable means the moſt likely to avert an impending calamity; the anſwer is obvious.</p>
                        <p>It is of ſmall moment to the point in queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the diſorder was imported, or originated in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from local cauſes; it is ſufficient to prove it contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and that it is ſo under certain ſituations and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances few will deny, who attentively conſider the foregoing ſtatement. Dr. Treat received the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion from viſiting the brig Zephyr, and the crew of the William received it from the ſame veſſel, from whence it was imbibed by the citizens of New York,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:028538_0046_0FD93876CBEF8AC0"/>
more immediately contiguous to its original ſources of contagion, and prediſpoſed to take the infection.</p>
                        <p>From the above ſtatement we think it will be readily admitted that the diſorder now prevalent in the city of New York, is of the ſame nature with that which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in Philadelphia in the year 1793, and that in certain ſituations and circumſtances it is alſo contagious: if theſe facts are admitted, we think they will ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently juſtify the meaſures we recommended.</p>
                        <p>Thus we have given to your excellency the principal facts, on which were founded our opinions and reports, and our reaſons for their juſtification.</p>
                        <p>In reſpect to the Proclamation prohibiting the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe between the two cities, we have to inform you that it was the unanimous opinion of the joint Boards, that there does not now appear any reaſon for revoking the ſaid Proclamation; on the contrary, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the prevailing hot weather, and the recent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices from New York, it was our unanimous opinion, that the Proclamation ſhould not only be continued; but that it ought to be ſtrictly carried into effect.</p>

                        <p>I had the honor (by yeſterdays poſt) of receiving your favor of the 3d inſt. covering a draft on the Bank of New York in my favour for 7000 dollars, to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the uſe of the poor and diſtreſſed of this city, in their preſent afflictions.</p>
                        <p>On the laſt evening I communicated the contents of your letter to the Health Committee, and on this day to the Common Council of the city; they heard it with heart-felt ſatisfaction, and prompted by inclination as well as duty, I do with great pleaſure, at their expreſs requeſt, in behalf of our afflicted fellow citizens, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to you, Sir, and the citizens of the city of Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, whom you have the honour to repreſent, our moſt reſpectful acknowledgements for the benevolent feelings and conſoling ſympathy which you expreſs for

our hapleſs ſituation, and which you and they have ſo fully manifeſted by the very liberal donations you have been pleaſed to tranſmit to us on this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. You may be aſſured, Sir, your benevolences will be faithfully applied, and will excite in your favour the repeated prayers and bleſſings of many a mourning fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, diſconſolate widow and helpleſs orphan.</p>
                        <p>I ſincerely lament that at ſo early a period after a calamitous and diſtreſſing peſtilence had in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure deſolated the city of Philadelphia, and excited to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her, in her afflicted ſtate, the tear of ſympathy and the hand of benevolence of her neighbours, the Almighty Ruler of heaven and earth ſhould have found too juſt cauſe to remind us, that we alſo are beings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on his ſovereign will, and that we have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited him with gratitude for the many very ſignal bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and unparalleled proſperity we have enjoyed ſince the late revolution, and our return to our dwellings; and by this diſtreſſing viſitation, to impreſs on our minds, that under him human beings are dependent on each other, by making us in turn the objects of the commiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and benevolence of our ſympathiſing neighbours.</p>
                        <p>I fervently hope and wiſh that you, ſir, and your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected fellow citizens, may never again witneſs ſuch diſtreſſing ſcenes as you have lately experienced; and that the affliction which has now come to the doors of my fellow citizens, may be ſanctified to the ſurvivors, and teach us, that unleſs ſupported by the Divine Hand the things of this life, which we ſo highly prize, are very vanity, and life itſelf a mere vapour.</p>
                        <p>We were very ſanguine in our expectations, about 4 weeks ago, conſidering the then general ſtate of health in this city, beyond all former ſeaſons, that the epidemic which was then confined to a ſmall diſtrict of the city, and which ſince has cauſed ſo much alarm and diſtreſs, and deprived us of ſome valuable citizens, would have been confined there and finally ſubſided; but the warm weather and fears of many, and want of caution in
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:028538_0050_0FD93880C4156130"/>
others, has cauſed it to ſpread from that quarter ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what northward and principally eaſtward to the ſhip yards, where it has been moſt fatal among the poor emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants, who lived and died in filth and dirt; and altho' the cool air of the cloſe of Sept. had much diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the mortality, and had given us reaſon to hope that the judgment would be ſpeedily removed, it has again, by the uncommonly warm weather, or perhaps unknown cauſes, become very alarming, and has taken off a few individuals, I ſuppoſe, not exceeding 30 or 40 in the whole, ſouth-weſt of the Fly market and Crown ſtreet, and weſt of Broad ſtreet, continued into the Bowery, excluſive of the Hoſpital.</p>
                        <p>The number of deaths has however, again decreaſed from 29 on Sunday evening, to 22 on Monday, and 17 on this evening (the whole number now being 525) and we have reaſon to hope and expect, from the ſmall number of new caſes which have come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Health Committee on the laſt evening, that, with the bleſſing of heaven, the diſeaſe will ſoon ſubſide, and permit our affrighted fugitive fellow citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, who are ſcattered in every quarter around us, to return to their dwellings in ſafety, and again open the intercourſe between us, and our more happy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; the want of which has in a very great degree enhanced our misfortunes.</p>
                        <p>Accept our unfeigned thanks, Sir, for the intereſting and friendly part you have taken in our days of calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and diſtreſs; and believe me to be with ſentiments of great perſonal reſpect and eſteem,</p>

                        <p>But three perſons have died on the laſt four days in this city, and but three at Belle Vue ſince the 27th of October, of fever in any degree reſembling our late epidemic.</p>
                        <p>The alarming ſituation in which this city has lately been, is calculated to excite the moſt ſerious reflections—to inſpire feelings of veneration for that all control<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Power who in the midſt of ſuch judgment numbers mercy!—We truſt that it has been under a ſentiment of grateful dependance on him, that we have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to fulfil the duties you had entruſted: And we truſt that while congratulations are repeated upon returning ſeaſons of health, all hearts may be diſpoſed to improve to moral and virtuous purpoſes both the threatening and felicitating diſpenſations of heaven. Your Committee at this period cheerfully recogniſe thoſe principles of undeviating veracity, which during
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:028538_0052_0FD9388908ACAC30"/>
the increaſing terror of their fellow citizens, directed their daily reports reſpecting the progreſs of diſeaſe. It is with great ſatisfaction that they have found it evinced by their experience, that ſuch exact details as they have made to the public, inſtead of increaſing thoſe terrors, have tended, in a great meaſure, to ſubdue them; and the accompliſhment of this is of immenſe importance to public happineſs and convenience; fear mitigates its objects. During the exiſtence of a cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of this kind, circumſtances will be ever exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, by the timidity and credulity of individuals.</p>
                        <p>It is to be lamented, however, that falſehoods have been propagated from the baſeſt, meaneſt, and the moſt deſpicable motives; by ſome as an apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy for their panic apprehenſious, by others, from the ſenſibilities of ſelf intereſt, and to gratify a ſordid luſt of gain. Lies have been propagated for the ſake of the wonderful, and the excitement of ſurprize, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ungenerouſly forgetful of the extenſive miſchiefs naturally originating from this ſource—deſpair, deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, poverty, famine and death!</p>
                        <p>Perhaps an ill-judged tenderneſs for their reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons has prevented the publication of the names of ſome offenders. Had the falſehood repeated with great confidence in the country had any proper foundation, our city would long ſince have been nearly deſolated.</p>
                        <p>We turn with pleaſure to the recollection of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances more creditable to hmanity; and to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the liberality of thoſe of our fellow citizens who have contributed to alleviate the diſtreſſes of the ſick and ſuffering poor. The generous inteferences of ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy from Philadelphia, and ſome neighboring villages, demand our laſting gratitude: Such inſtances of mutual good will and beneficence remain grateful memorials of the fraternity of a free and virtuous people.</p>
                        <p>From theſe reſources, 8837 dols. have been received; and your Committee feel a reſponſibility in the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and juſt diſtribution. Its proper objects being nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:028538_0053_0FD9388B0746CB00"/>
and often probably not within the ſphere of individual knowledge, each of the members of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee is aſſociated with two reſpectable citizens in ſeeking out the ſick, and relieving thoſe to whom their charity is directed.</p>
                        <p>Circumſtances have not been wanting to ſhew the happy influence of temperance, cleanlineſs, and cold upon the late epidemic. But while we rejoice that benevolent nature has given power to theſe agents to ſet bounds to its ravages, let us recollect that they are aſſiduouſly to be employed. We feel it incumbent on us to remind our fellow citizens of this truth, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly thoſe who are returning from the country. Houſes which have contained the ſick, ſhould be carefully ventulated; and things that have been employed by them, that cannot conveniently be cleanſed by water, ſhould be ſubjected freely to the action of cold.</p>
                        <p>It is not impoſſible that neglect in thoſe particulars may occaſion a few ſolitary inſtances of this diſeaſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til we have experienced intenſe froſt. For though we flatter ourſelves it is extinguiſhed as an epidemic, and our ſtreets free from all infection, we have before us the experience of other places to impreſs the neceſſity of ſuch precautions.</p>
                        <p>Among the arrangements made by the Committee to prevent the ſpread of infectious diſeaſe they conſider early interments and the uſe of the hearſe, as one of the moſt important. Satisfactory proofs of its utility might be detailed. It is to be wiſhed that the good ſenſe of the community might be exerted to conquer any prejudice which may remain in oppoſition to a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of burial ſo much more convenient than the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon mode, and ſo much more ſafe.</p>
                        <p>The preſent ſtate of Belle Vue hoſpital is pleaſing; not only from it we anticipate the ſpeedy extinction of all diſeaſe therein, but from the happy and comfortable ſituation of the ſick, and from the ſatisfaction expreſſed by them with reſpect to their medical aid and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:028538_0054_0FD9388C3620CBD8"/>
But three new patients have been received dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the laſt ten days. There are now thirteen ſick in the hoſpital, twelve of whom are conſidered as out of all danger. Since its firſt eſtabliſhment, eighty nine perſons have been diſcharged, cured; the deaths have been publiſhed with our daily reports.</p>
                        <p>It is with great ſatisfaction that we remark that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome of the people have been ſlightly affected with the epidemic no one has died.</p>
                        <p>Much to the injury of the unfortunate perſons who have been ſent to this place, its circumſtances have been groſsly miſrepreſented. The ſick have in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, in numerous inſtances, ſought this aſylum with hearts aching with anxiety and deſpair.</p>
                        <p>A ſenior conſulting phyſician was early appointed to viſit it occaſionally from this city. From its firſt eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, one, and ſince the 24th of Sept. two, phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians have conſtantly reſided within its walls. A new building has been erected during the ſickneſs, and no expenſe has been ſpared to render the ſick commodious and happy. A Committee from this Board have made frequent viſits and examination of its circumſtances, and from time to time have witneſſed with pleaſure its improving ſtate.</p>
                        <p>A more vigilant, humane, or attentive man was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver appointed purveyor to an hoſpital, than our late worthy member Mr. Frederick Steymets, whoſe death reminds us of the loſs of our other friend and aſſociate, Dr. M. Treat, who there is reaſon to ſuſpect, was alſo a victim to the diſcharge of faithful duty. The public will join with us in deploring the loſs of ſuch worthy and reſpectable members of ſociety.</p>
                        <p>Before we diſmiſs the ſubject of the hoſpital, it is but juſt that we acknowledge our ſenſe of the merit of Dr. Alexander Anderſon, and Dr. M'Farlin, reſident phyſicians at Belle Vue.<note n="*" place="bottom">The former of theſe gentlemen engaged with zeal and virtue, at early period and under diſcouraging circumſtances, in their ardu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous duty.</note> Both for their perſevering

attention, humanity and fidelity to the ſick, they have deſerved well of their country.</p>
                        <p>The Committee being employed in arranging expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditures, and in the ſettlements of accounts, requeſt that all perſons having demands upon them, preſent the ſame to alderman Furman, 106, Broad Way, on or before the 20th inſtant.</p>
