            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOUR's of the 20th of <hi>May,</hi> I have received, in which you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the Extortion and Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which is breaking in upon this People, and admire that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment does not by ſome ſutable Laws prevent it, more eſpecially you complain of the Gentlemen concerned in the Bank, and wonder how any Men can be ſo blind as not to foreſee the fatal Conſequences that would attend that Project.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Place, I muſt inform you, That the Scheme theſe Bankers are come into is not the Scheme which was firſt propoſed: The firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal was to make <hi>One hundred thouſand Pounds,</hi> in Notes to be paid in to the Truſtees of the Bank in ten Years, in Silver at <hi>twenty Shillings</hi> per Ounce; the Silver to remain in the Bank until the ten Years were expired, By this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:040100_0003_10162B5AF8F592D0"/>
we ſhould have been ſure of <hi>One hundred thouſand Pounds</hi> paſſing amongſt us to carry on our Trade, &amp; at the End of the ten Years there would have been <hi>One hundred thouſand Pounds</hi> in Silver to exchange for thoſe Bills, for it would not have been worth any Man's while to have lock'd up theſe Notes in their Cheſts for ten Years, through it might anſwer their End to lock them up for three Years as they now do; I muſt ſay it was ſurprizing to me to ſee the Gentlemen concerned in that Affair ſo eaſily impoſed on and perſwaded to alter the Scheme, and agree to have the Silver drawn out at three Periods, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> three Tenths at the End of three Years, and three Tenths more at the End of other three Years, and the remaining four Tenths at the End of the tenth Year: How doth this agree with their pretended Deſign in erecting this Bank; they pretended that their Deſign was to ſupply the People with a Medium of Exchange, and under that Notion refuſed letting in any to ſubſcribe who would not oblige themſelves to refuſe the <hi>Rhode Iſland</hi> Bills emitted in 1733. Actions ſpeak louder than Words, and are more to be regarded: When they firſt propoſed this Alteration in their Scheme, they were told it would ruin their Deſign, for that the Bills or Notes would be hoarded up, and that it would raiſe the Price of Silver and Gold, inſtead of lowering the Price thereof, as they pretended it would do: I confeſs I was ſick of the Project when I heard that one Gentleman ſigned <hi>ten thouſand Pounds,</hi> which was a tenth Part of the Stock, and that he and others for him inſiſted on his having twenty Votes; to ſuffer this I ſaid
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:040100_0004_10162B6058465EE8"/>
was Diſtraction in the Subſcribers, and contrary to the Policy of all Nations: Power is uſually Handmaid to Riches, therefore when Men of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergrown Eſtates are graſping after Power, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where People have a jealous Eye over'em, leaſt they be ſwallowed up by them before they are aware: I ſuppoſe there never was the like Inſtance in any Bank. In the Bank of <hi>England,</hi> South Sea, or India Stocks, any Man who hath <hi>One thouſand Pounds</hi> original Stock hath two Votes, and he who hath <hi>One hundred thouſand Pounds</hi> hath but four Votes, and theſe Banks are ſettled by Act of Parliament, ſo careful is the Government to prevent the Rich oppreſſing their poor Neighbours, and I ſhall always be of Opinion, that the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> which is compoſed of ſo many wiſe, able Stateſmen, and ſo many ingenious Merchants, and have been in the Practice of theſe Things for Ages paſt, are better Judges in ſuch Matters than we who are but of Yeſterday.</p>
            <p>It was eaſy to ſee what theſe Men were driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at who propoſed drawing the Silver out at three Periods: But much the greateſt Part of the Subſcribers were drawn in by others before they conſidered the Conſequences that would attend the Alteration, and now dearly repent and ſay they were impoſed on, and all they have to ſay for themſelves is, alas, who would have thought that Men who ſwim in abundance, and have as one would think more than Heart can wiſh, ſhould ſhew themſelves ſo unſatiably Avaricious, ſo Unconſcionable and Unjuſt as to pay Men <hi>Rhode Iſland</hi> Bills and oblige them to
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:040100_0005_10162B62B7A0F780"/>
give Bonds to pay in Lieu thereof Merchants Notes, or on Failure of paying ſuch Notes, to pay Silver at <hi>nineteen Shillings</hi> per Ounce, and at the ſame time theſe very Men are ingroſſing the Notes, and give an Advance on them to get 'em all, if poſſible, into their own Hands, that ſo thoſe who have mortgaged their Eſtates to them may never be able to redeem them, and ſo of Conſequence ſuch Eſtates muſt fall into their Hands for what they will be pleaſed to allow for them: I can't but pity thoſe who are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Mercy of ſuch Men.</p>
            <p>But to theſe Things the Uſurer will reply and ſay, That it is at the Borrower's Election whether he will take up their Money on ſuch Terms or no, and perhaps he will pretend it was out of pure Friendſhip and to ſerve the Man that he lent him his Money, &amp;c. But will not every impartial Man who hears him ſay ſo, laugh at all ſuch idle Pretences; a Friend will rather abate of the common Intereſt than make any Advantage of his Friend's Neceſſity: A Man ought not to exact on a Stranger, much leſs on his Friend: But the Right of the Matter is this, The Law of the Land ought to be a Rule to the Uſurer in this Caſe, that Man who can't be content with the common Intereſt, but will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act more than the Law hath ſet Intereſt at, is a Breaker of the Law and oppreſſes his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; but notwithſtanding we have a good and wholeſome Law to prevent Men's taking exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Uſury, many Men make no Scruple to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act <hi>ten</hi> per Cent for Loan of Money in Defiance of the Law; as I ſaid before, the Law ought to
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:040100_0006_10162B652B0BDA08"/>
be kept ſtrictly unto, for if Men ſwerve from the Law, and it is winked at by the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is like breaking down the Hedge or Wall, and letting in the wild Creatures to devour the Vineyard; and as to the frivolous Pretence that it is at the Election of the Borrower to take the Money or leave it, it is Neceſſity that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges Men to take up Money when they give more than the common Intereſt, and that the Lender knows very well, and no Man ought to make another Man's Neceſſity his Opportunity, and take Advantage thereof to ſqueeze and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs him: Let us eat and drink to day, for to morrow we die; rather than go into a Goal Men will comply with any Terms be they never ſo hard and unreaſonable: And it is for this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the Legiſlator makes Laws to reſtrain the Corruptions &amp; vicious Inclinations of Men, without which Laws Men would prey upon one another like Fiſh in the Sea, the greater would devour the leſs: But yet notwithſtanding the good Laws we have to prevent this Evil from ſpreading amongſt us, it is too much practiſed at this Day to the Ruin of many Families, and if ſome ſpeedy Remedy be not found out to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it, a few Uſurers will ſoon eat up the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which many induſtrious People have been many Years ſcraping together, in Hopes that their Children would reap the Benefit of it.</p>
            <p>As to what you ſay about the Government's interpoſing their Authority to prevent the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of ſo many Families as are in Danger of being ruined by this vile Bank, I am inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it was propoſed in the Aſſembly to make our
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:040100_0007_10162B67E24FC488"/>
Province Bills a lawful Tender for them; how that Matter came to be dropt I know not, it is great Pity it was not proſecuted to Effect, for ſuch an Act would have been of great Service, not only to thoſe who have mortgaged their Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates for theſe Bank Notes, or have borrowed Money on Bond, to pay in theſe Notes or in Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but to the greateſt Part of the Bankers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who groan under the Burthen when the Time comes to pay in their Silver, for it hath raiſed the Price of Silver to <hi>Twenty ſeven Shillings and ſix Pence</hi> per Ounce; what dreadful Sufferers then are they like to be, who as ſoon as they received their Money out of this Bank, put it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way immediately to pay their Debts, and never had the Advantage of making any profitable Improvement of it, it hath been a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Bank to ſuch Men, their Caſe calls for Pity.</p>
            <p>The Objections made by ſome in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly againſt making the Province Bills a lawful Tender for theſe Notes are, Firſt, They make a Matter of Conſcience of it, to oblige a Man to take any thing for his Bond, other than what is mentioned in the Condition. And Secondly, They ſay it will be a Means of having the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Bills hoarded up; In Anſwer to theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, I muſt obſerve, That the Government have in their great Wiſdom, with great Juſtice and in Compaſſion to the Poor, as well becomes the Fathers of the People, made the Bills of this Province a lawful Tender for any Debt that ſhould be contracted after the making that Law, ſo that no Perſon may be impriſoned who ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:040100_0008_10162B6BA6C575F8"/>
thoſe Bills for Payment; and ſhall the ſame Government ſee a few Men iſſue out their own Notes as a Bank, and call <hi>nineteen Shillings</hi> of thoſe Notes an Ounce of Silver, and take Bonds for them accordingly? Shall Uſurers as they come to be poſſeſt of theſe Notes, call in their Bonds and Morgages, and oblige their Debtors to give new Bonds and Mortgages, payable in theſe Notes, or Silver at <hi>nineteen Shillings</hi> per Ounce? Shall a few mercenary Men ſo prey up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their neceſſitous Neighbours, as to pay them <hi>Rhode Iſland</hi> Bills, &amp; oblige them to give Bonds or Mortgages to pay in Lieu thereof Bank Notes or an Ounce of Silver for every <hi>nineteen Shillings,</hi> when an Ounce of Silver is worth <hi>twenty-ſeven Shillings and ſix Pence,</hi> and riſing, and will be at <hi>thirty Shillings</hi> per Ounce before the Year comes about, if this Bank continues as it is, I ſay will the Government ſuffer ſuch horrid Injuſtice? No ſurely. No Chriſtian can hear theſe Things and not be deeply affected at the Thoughts of ſuch monſtrous Extortion and Oppreſſion breaking in like a Torrent upon the People, much leſs will a Chriſtian Government ſuffer it: But I have heard ſome of theſe Bankers ſay, It is not in the Power of the Government to do any thing to relieve the People in this Matter: To which I reply and ſay, When a Phyſician finds his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients Caſe extremely hazardous, he will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to go further than in ordinary Caſes, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Diſeaſes call for extraordinary Remedies, even ſo when the State is diſordered and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion and Oppreſſion comes rowling over a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple like the raging Sea, and all Things are run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into Confuſion; whence can we expect
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:040100_0009_10162B6E31DD32A0"/>
Relief but from the Government who are cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Power for that very End, and GOD ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects it from them; that they be Eyes to the blind, and Feet to the lame, and deliver the Poor out of the Hands of their Oppreſſors: The Rich are always able to help themſelves, and it is in their Power, very often, to oppreſs their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, if the Government do not take Care to prevent it, and their Aſſiſtance was never more wanted than at this Day to deliver this poor op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and diſtreſſed People out of the Hands of the Rich and Mighty: I believe every diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted Man in the Province will ſay, That he who receives <hi>Rhode Iſland</hi> Bills, ought to pay in the ſame, and all others ought to pay in Bills of this Province. Shall any Man's Note be better than the Money of the Government eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by the Law of the Land and confirmed by the King? Can there be any Injuſtice in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Law to oblige every Man who hath paid <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> Bills to accept the ſame for any Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialties for which he paid no other than thoſe Bills, and to oblige all others to receive the Bills of this Government in lieu of the Merchants Notes? No, I know it is the Opinion of many good Men and rich Men too amongſt us, That ſuch a Law would do a great deal of Good, and do no Injuſtice to any Man: Moſt certainly it would do this Good, it would bring abroad the Merchants Notes, we ſhou'd ſoon ſee them abroad circulating in Trade and doing the Office for which it was pretended they were made, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> paſs from Man to Man to facilitate our Payments in in our Commerce, and I am perſwaded that nine Tenths of the Bankers were concerned with no
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:040100_0010_10162B6FBB948C58"/>
other Views, but that the whole People ſhould reap that Benefit by the Circulation of the Notes; but when it was propoſed to draw 'em in at three Periods, no Man that wou'd beſtow a Thought on it, could think they ever would Circulate or do the leaſt Good to the Trade, or to People in general, but quite the contrary: It was eaſy to ſee that ſome Men would build great Eſtates by them, and that many Families would be ruined by them. And can this be thought to be for the Good of the Publick? All Men know that the middling Sort of People are the greateſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to the common Wealth, they pay the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Part to ſupport both Church and State. But we, in the Method we are in, ſhall in a little Time have no middling Sort, we ſhall have a few, and but a very few Lords, and all the reſt Beggars: Some there are among us who ſay there is Money enough, and that there is no Want of Money with them to whom the Money belongs; as if Money was deſigned only for a few rich Men to lye in their Cheſts, until a lucky Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity offers it ſelf for them to make their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket with on their poor Neighbours: I confeſs theſe Men's Notions concerning Money, vaſtly differs from mine: I think every Man is Intitled to Money, as much as the richeſt Man amongſt us; I mean to ſo much as he Earns; the Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Labourers ought to receive their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney as ſoon as their Work is done, and not be turned away to Shops, <hi>or perhaps to a Shop for their Pay:</hi> The Labourers at this Day will work for <hi>Six Shillings</hi> per Day in Money rather than for <hi>Seven Shillings</hi> in Goods, and I believe it is their Intereſt ſo to do, I confeſs, I ſhall never

think there is Money enough till poor Men can get Money for their Labour, and have it in their Power to lay it out where they can be beſt uſed, and not be obliged to go to ſuch a particular Shop for their Pay becauſe their Imployer deals with that Shop and no other, which is the Caſe of many in this Town every Day, and it is to be feared, ſome Shopkeepers uſe but little Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with ſuch Cuſtomers, but make 'em pay dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for what they have.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Objection ſome make againſt the Province Bills being made a lawful Tender for the Merchants Notes is, That in lieu of hoarding up theſe Notes, they will then hoard up the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Bills: But I confeſs I can ſee no weight at all in this Argument, for theſe Notes are moſtly in the Hands of the Merchants who made 'em, and now keep 'em on Purpoſe to make a Market of 'em by leting 'em out to receive Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at <hi>Nineteen Shillings</hi> per Ounce in lieu of them, and they never will come abroad until there be ſuch a Law made. But admit it ſhould have that Tendency as they pretend, we ſhou'd be much better than we are now with Reſpect to our Trade; for we ſhould then as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, have the Notes abroad Circulating in Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that would prevent hundreds of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits which are brought into the Courts only through the ſcarcity of Money. This Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration alone methinks ſhould induce the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Court to make the Province Bills a lawful Tender for them. But add to this the mighty Advantage it would be to many poor Men whoſe preſſing Neceſſities have obliged 'em to Mortgage
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:040100_0012_10162B75A4213CB0"/>
their Eſtates for theſe Notes, who if ſomething be not done for their Relief will be obliged to pay forty per Cent for the Money they have ſo borrowed, over and above the common Intereſt eſtabliſhed by Law. But I can't believe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Bills will be hoarded up more than they now are, if there were ſuch a Law; for every Man who keeps any Money by him, keeps our Province Bills as long as he can, it is the laſt Money he will part with. We ſee very few of 'em abroad, we have little elſe but <hi>Rhode Iſland</hi> Bills to go to Market with from Day to Day to buy our Proviſions with. To ſpeak plain, our Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune is, we have a few lucky Men among us who have had the good Fortune to raiſe conſiderable Eſtates from nothing within theſe twenty or thirty Years: theſe Men are for ſinking all paper Mediums, and ſay, If the paper Bills were once gone we ſhou'd have Silver among us; but I confeſs I can't be of their Opinion, I rather think we muſt have a paper Medium or none at all: While the Ballance of our Trade with <hi>Great-Britain</hi> is ſo much in their Favour, all our Silver and Gold which we Import from other Places, will go to <hi>England</hi> to Ballance that Account, we ſhall have none of it ſtay with us until we can find a Way to live more Independent of them: And every Scheme that can be projected to bring in Silver, will moſt certainly be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſame Inconveniencies which have attended the Merchants Notes. I wiſh ſome Method could be found out to revive our dying Trade, for I ſee nothing but Poverty and Miſery before us in the Way we are in; our Neighbours at <hi>Rhode Iſland</hi> Thrive and grow Rich while
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:040100_0013_10162B7926C070D0"/>
we decline every Year; they ſit eaſy, the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of their Money out on Loan pays the whole Charge of the Government, while we are loaded with Taxes, more eſpecially this Town, we ſet at a very great Charge, more then the People will be able to pay, unleſs ſome Way can be found out to enliven our Trade, which I am of opinion muſt be by ſupplying the People with Money, or aſſiſting them in ſupplying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a private Way.</p>
            <p>It ſeems very ſtrange, that Men who have raiſed themſelves and Families from no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by the Help of our Province Bills, ſhould be ſuch bitter Enemies to a Paper Medium; I am ſure it is paſt the Art of Man to make Silver paſs as Money unleſs you can prevent the Silver which comes in being ſhip'd off again: If ſome Way be not found out to ſupply the Trade with ſome Medium or other, to buy and ſell with and pay our Debts with, our Trade will ſink and come to nothing, and Poverty will ſoon over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread the whole Land, both Town and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: We in this and the other Sea Ports will be firſt affected with it, but the whole Land will feel the ſad Effect of it in a little Time: We may ſpeak as contemptibly as we pleaſe of the <hi>Rhode-Iſlanders</hi> emitting Bills, they have found the Sweet of it, for they have eaten up half our Trade with it, and will ſoon eat us out of all if we don't contrive ſome ſort of Money to paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us: It is eaſy for us to have a better Medium than what we now have, for we have nothing but <hi>Rhode Iſland</hi> Bills paſſing among us, whereas if we had a Medium of our own we
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:040100_0014_1016201D02812CA0"/>
might ſoon ſink all their Bills, but to talk of refuſing to take them, before we can have ſome other Medium to anſwer in Lieu of them, ſeems very ſtrange, it is Neceſſity alone which gives them a Currency: Did ever any trading Place pretend to carry on their Trade without ſome ſort of Money; I believe every Nation under the Sun have ſomething paſſing amongſt them, which anſwers inſtead thereof. It is evident that the Heathen in this Land had their Wampum which paſſed amongſt them, and no doubt, was in as much Eſteem with them as Silver is with us, and with it they traded; the Inland Country ſupplied thoſe who dwelt on the Sea Coaſt with Furs, &amp;c. for Cloathing, and they who dwelt on the Sea Coaſt ſupplied the Country with Fiſh, Fowl, &amp;c. according to the different Seaſons of the Year. I have heard ſome Gentlemen cry up this Merchants Bank for the beſt Paper Money that ever was made, but I think I have plainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it to be juſt the Reverſe; had they ſtuck to the firſt Propoſal it would have been of general Service for eight or nine Years, but ſome Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen had not Patience to wait ſo long for the Silver, which proved the Ruin of the Scheme. To Conclude, Happy ſhould we be if we always bore in mind thoſe wiſe Sayings left us upon Record; <hi>Riches profit not in the Day of Wrath; a little that a righteous Man hath is better than the Treaſures of many Wicked.</hi>
