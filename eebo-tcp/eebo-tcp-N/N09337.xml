            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ESSAY, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>NO ſubject can be more important in itſelf, or better ſuited to the preſent occaſion, and the exerciſes of this day, than the Uſe and Advantages of the fine Arts, and eſpecially thoſe of Polite Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature. Theſe ſtudies are perhaps too much under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued by the public, and neglected by the youth in our ſeminaries of ſcience. They are conſidered as meer matters of trifling amuſement, and deſpised in compariſon with the more ſolid branches of Learning.</p>
            <p>The knowlege of Languages, Mathematics, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſics and Philoſophy, undoubtedly deſerves to engage the attention of the greateſt Genius. For ſkill in theſe ſciences, the World (while the world remains) will revere the memory of a Bacon, a Newton, and a Locke. But when they are carried beyond a certain point; when they are of no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the common purpoſes of life; when they are employed upon queſtions which human Reaſon can never with certainty determine, they degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into meer ſpeculations of amuſement, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come no farther valuable, than as they ſerve to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the mind, clear the underſtanding, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain us in the hours of leiſure from the important avocations of buſineſs. The Geometrical labours 
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011901_0003_0F87428917748828"/>
for the Quadrature of the Circle, the Metaphyſical controverſies about the Exiſtence of matter, and the Eſſence of Spirit, though a field for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of genius, in what are they more intereſting to mankind, than the contentions of Antiquaries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the genuineneſs of a medal, or the diſputes of Commentators about the various readings of their antient manuſcripts?</p>
            <p>Let us conſider the advantages which ariſe to the world from the ſtudy of the liberal Arts.</p>
            <p>Mankind in the preſent state, are extremely lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be led away by mean and ſordid vices, to be attached to the low enjoyments of ſenſe, and thus degraded almoſt to a level with the brutal creation. As that unceaſing thirſt for happineſs, which is the univerſal ſpring of action, muſt have ſome object for its gratification; the Divine Being, to raiſe us above these low desires, hath implanted in our minds a taste for more pure and intellectual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures. Theſe pleaſures have their ſource in the fine Arts, and are more eſpecially found in the elegant entertainments of polite Literature. They ennoble the ſoul, purify the paſſions, and give the thoughts a better turn. They add dignity to our ſentiments, delicacy and refinement to our manners. They ſet us above our meaner purſuits, and make us ſcorn thoſe low enjoyments, which perhaps we once eſteemed as the perfection of human felicity. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to all perſons of judgment, whether they can riſe from reading a fine Poem, viewing any maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly work of Genius, or hearing an harmonious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert 
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:011901_0004_0F87428973044998"/>
of Muſic, without feeling an openneſs of heart, and an elevation of mind, without being more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of the dignity of human nature, and deſpiſing whatever tends to debaſe and degrade it?</p>
            <p>Theſe are the delights, which humanize the ſoul, and poliſh away that rugged ferocity of manners, which is natural to the uncultivated nations of the world.</p>
            <p>In every land, in every age, at the time when the unconquered ſpirit of freedom, joined with that laudable ambition, which fires the ſoul to heroic deeds; hath raiſed the nation to the higheſt pitch of glory, the fine Arts have been ſtudiouſly cultivated, and have ſhined forth with peculiar luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre. For Learning and Glory walk hand in hand through the world. A ſavage people, before the dawn of literature, may indeed be terrible in arms: but being ſtained with the blood of cruelty, tarniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that wild barbarity, which degrades cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage into brutality, they never attain to the ſummit of renown; and either ſink unnoticed into oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or leave to poſterity a name more infamous for barbariſm, than famed for heroic atchievements. While every voice celebrates the bravery of an Alexander, a Scipio, a Caeſar, and a Marlbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough; who remembers the ſavage fierceneſs of the lion-hearted Richard; or what mouth is opened in the praiſe of that ſcourge of Aſia, the perſian Nadir?</p>
            <p>The ſame ardour of ambition, the ſame greatneſs
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011901_0005_0F87428A30094978"/>
of thought, which inſpires the Warrior to brave dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the conquering field, when diffuſed among a people will call forth Genius in every ſtation of life, fire the imagination of the Artiſt, and raiſe to ſublimity the aſpiring Muſe.</p>
            <p>Look into the annals of antiquity. View the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians at the aera of learning and politeneſs, when the fine Arts were carried to their higheſt glory, when the whole nation were encouragers of ſcience, and every perſon a judge of literature; when by great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of genius, correctneſs of taſte and refinement of manners, they rendered themſelves famous throughout the world, and patterns of imitation to all poſterity. Then was the time that Greece pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced thoſe Heroes that astonished Europe and Asia with the ſound of their victories; then was the time that Athens, Sparta and Thebes gave laws to the world. And could a Nation fail of riſing to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pitch of fame, when animated with the thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eloquence of Demoſthenes and Pericles, fired to warlike deeds by the martial muſe of Homer, and warmed with thoſe noble ſentiments which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire the productions of Aeſchylus, Euripides and Sophocles?</p>
            <p>The glory of Arts and Arms ſunk in Greece and roſe again with renewed luſtre in Heſperia. Rome diſtinguiſhed herſelf for literature, even from the firſt dawn of her greatneſs. In her early days, while her unpoliſhed manners bore too near a reſemblance to the rough virtues of Sparta, ſhe could boaſt an Ennius, the boldneſs of whoſe thoughts even Virgil
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011901_0006_0F87428AE846A370"/>
himſelf did not diſdain to imitate. Then flouriſhed Accius, Naevius, Pacuvius, thoſe ſamed dramatic poets, with the bold and ſpirited Lucilius, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Roman ſatire. But theſe writers have ſunk into the dark grave of oblivion, and left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind only ſome ſmall traces of their ſame. Then appeared the rough genius of Plautus, the milder elegance of Terence, and the ſoft muſe of Catullus: Then the poliſhed Lucretius, ſo diſtinguiſhed for all the graces of poetic expreſſion, that Virgil evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently borrowed from his writings, his ſtyle, verſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and manner of deſcription. In the mean time Eloquence roſe to the higheſt perfection at Rome. Be Cicero a witneſs, whoſe praiſe is unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, whether as an orator, a patriot, or a phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher.</p>
            <p>But ſee Rome attains to the ſummit of greatneſs. The world ſubmits to her ſway. Satiated with the ſpoils of victory, ſhe ſits unmoleſted on the throne, and diffuſes the mild bleſſings of peace. Then flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh the names deareſt to ſame, the glories of the Auguſtan age: The majeſtic Muſe of Virgil, the ſecond who dared to attempt the dignity of epic ſong; the poliſhed elegance of Horace, graced with the ſounding lyre, and armed with the keen ſword of ſatire; the ſtrong and ſportive imagination of Ovid; the ſoft elegiac ſtrains of Tibullus and Propertius; and the hiſtoric grandeur of Livy. The world is conſcious of their fame. Their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters need not to be illuſtrated by the tedious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence of praiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:011901_0007_0F87428BA5C3C150"/>
The Glory of Rome faded by a gradual decay. The Muſe ſtill ſhone, though with tarniſhed luſtre, in the tragedies of Seneca, the ſatires of Juvenal and Perſius, and the heroic poems of Lucan, Statius, Claudian, and Silius Italicus. Hiſtory produced the nervous, the manly Tacitus; and Philoſophy could ſtill ſhow her Seneca and Pliny. Till at length Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny uſurped the dominion, and Barbariſm over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread the land of Italy.</p>
            <p>For a nearer inſtance of the trophies of the liberal Arts, let us view the ſtate of Ruſſia in the laſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury. In a cold unpoliſhed land, deep-ſunk in the ſhades of ſavage ignorance, a Monarch riſes, who moved with compaſſion for his ſubjects, fired with love of glory, and endowed with a ſoul ſuperior to the age, forms a project of civilizing his country. He ſails to other lands, imports the rudiments of the arts, and affords both by precept and example the utmoſt encouragement to genius. The Nation raiſes herſelf from the duſt, repels her enemies, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends her borders, leads forth her conquering ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and now threatens the total ſubverſion of the Ottoman empire.</p>
            <p>Britain alone can claim the glory of an equality with Greece and Rome. There for two centuries the Arts have flouriſhed with almoſt unabated luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre: And the ſlighteſt reflection will inform us that this period is by far the moſt celebrated in the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh hiſtory. In the glorious reign of Elizabeth, there aroſe a Spenſer, unequalled in all the pleaſing charms of luxuriant deſcription; whoſe fancy tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011901_0008_0F87428C6766F5B8"/>
us to fairy land, and brings us acquainted with a ſhadowy race, the beings of his own creation. Then a Shakeſpear, the matchleſs genius of the drama; endowed with the moſt noble extravagance of imagination, the ſtrongeſt powers of humour, the ſovereign command of the paſſions, and the keeneſt inſpection into all the mazes of the human ſoul. To theſe succeeded the unbridled wit of Cowley, the ſoft graces of Waller, and the various grandeur of all-accompliſhed Dryden. Then with the united charms of every Muſe, appeared the immortal Milton; who with the greateſt force of natural genius, aſſisted by all the aids of art, and by the noble deſcriptions of the insſired writers, hath produced a Poem, almoſt as much ſuperior to Homer's, in ſublimity of conception, as it is in the greatneſs of its ſubject:
<q>
                  <l>A Genius univerſal as his theme,</l>
                  <l>Aſtonishing as Chaos, as the bloom</l>
                  <l>Of blowing Eden fair, as Heav'n ſublime.</l>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>Thomſon</hi>
                  </bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>After a ſhort eclipſe in the luxurious reign of Charles II. the reviving Arts ſhone forth with ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior brightneſs in the proſperous days of William and Anne; while the victorious Marlborough bore Britain's thunder on her foes, and made Europe tremble at the ſound of his arms. Then flouriſhed the poliſhed muſe of Addiſon, who revived in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land the claſſic elegance of the Auguſtan age; whoſe works, adorned with the higheſt ſublimity of ſentiment, and the niceſt delicacy of thought,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011901_0009_0F87428D21A80B08"/>
filled with eaſy humour which points the ridicule at vice, (while they afford inſtruction and entertainment of the nobleſt kind to every reader,) may boaſt as their greateſt honour and diſtinguiſhed excellence, that they are peculiarly calculated to pleaſe and improve the faireſt part of the creation.</p>
            <p>Then aroſe a Swift, the friend of virtue, the ſcourge of folly, and the terror of vice; unequalled for manly ſenſe, livelineſs of fancy, the powers of wit and humour, and the ſevereſt poignancy of ſatire. Happy, had not his mind, ſoured with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoinment in the earlieſt views of his ambition, too often endeavoured by the groſſeſt indelicacy of deſcription to debaſe the dignity of human nature; and indulged a ſpirit of miſanthropy, which clouds his beſt productions, and while we admire the force of his Genius, bids us deteſt the ſentiments of his heart. What age ſhall forget the undying fame of Pope! Whether in pleaſing ſtrains he paints the beauties of nature; mourns with the ſofteſt notes of elegiac verſe; or with moral rapture unfolds all the principles and paſſions of the human ſoul: Whether in ſportive lays he diſplays the foibles of the gentler Sex; impales vice and dulneſs on the point of ſatire; or holding, up the glaſs of tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reflects with unabated light the glories of the Maeonian ſong.</p>
            <p>For the power of deſcribing the beauties of rural ſcenes, and copying the different appearances of nature, what writer can vie with the pleaſing Thom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon! The livelineſs of his paintings, his ſublime
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011901_0010_0F87428E3411ECF0"/>
morality, and his delicacy of thought juſtly raiſe him to the higheſt rank of genius.</p>
            <p>Nor muſt we forget the unaffected eaſe of Gay and Prior, the ſpirited wit of Congreve, the delicate fancy of Parnelle, the dramatic powers of Otway, Southern and Rowe, the cervantic humour of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buthnot, with the pointed ſatire and ſtrong imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Young. Theſe writers will convey the Engliſh glory to the moſt diſtant ages of poſterity.</p>
            <p>Polite Letters at preſent are much on the decline in Britain; not through a ſcarcity of authors, or want of encouragement from the public; but by reaſon of that luxurious effeminacy, which hath cauſed a decay of genius, and introduced a falſe taſte in writing. Their Men of learning are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with pedantry. They are great admirers of antiquity and followers in the path of ſervile imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. They ſacrifice eaſe and elegance to the affectation of claſſic correctneſs, ſetter the fancy with the rules of method, and damp all the ardour of aſpiring invention. While the men of Genius (who are at preſent a diſtinct claſs of writers) in contempt of the critic chains, throw off all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of order and connection, ſport in the wildeſt ſallies of imagination, and adopt the greateſt extravagance of humour, which too often ſinks to buffoonery, or is ſoured with the malevolence of ſatire.</p>
            <p>America hath a fair proſpect in a few centuries of ruling both in arts and arms. It is univerſally

allowed that we very much excel in the force of natural genius. And although but few among us are able to devote their whole lives to ſtudy, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps there is no nation, in which a larger portion of learning is diffuſed through all ranks of people. For as we generally poſſeſs the middle ſtation of life, neither ſunk to vaſſalage, nor raiſed to inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, we avoid the ſordid ignorance of peaſants, and the unthinking diſſipation of the great. The heroic love of Liberty, the manly fortitude, the generoſity of ſentiment, for which we have been ſo juſtly celebrated, ſeem to promiſe the future ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement and eſtabliſhed duration of our glory. Many incidents unfortunate in themſelves, have tended to call forth and ſuſtain theſe virtues. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, in this reſpect, have been our late ſtruggles for liberty! They have awakened the ſpirit of freedom; they have rectified the manners of the times; they have made us acquainted with the rights of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; recalled to our minds the glorious indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of former ages, fired us with the views of fame, and by filling our thoughts with contempt of the imported articles of luxury, have raiſed an oppoſition, not only to the illegal power, but to the effeminate manners of Britain. And I cannot but hope, notwithſtanding ſome dangerous examples of infamous defection, that there is a ſpirit remaining in theſe Colonies, that will invariably oppoſe itſelf to the efforts of uſurpation and perfidy, and forbid that Avarice ſhould ever betray us to Slavery.</p>
            <p>This Land hath already begun to diſtinguiſh it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in literature. It is peculiarly famed for the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011901_0012_0F8742913496B908"/>
ſtudy of Theology; and though too much infeſted with the ſhort-lived productions controverſy, can boaſt of ſome Divines, who however inelegant in ſtyle and expreſſion, have perhaps never been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled in depth of thought and profoundneſs of reaſoning. Out late writers in the cauſe of liberty have gained the applauſe of Europe. Many elegant eſſays have been produced in the ſtyle of wit and humour; nor hath Poetry been entirely uncultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among us. The encouragement, which is given to the Arts and Sciences, affords a proſpect of our future glory.</p>
