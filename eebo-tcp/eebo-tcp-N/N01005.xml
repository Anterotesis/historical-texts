            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Am ſenſible of many diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges I am under for ſuch Service as this; but it being providenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally caſt upon me, I ſhall improve this opportunity to expreſs my
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001202_0003_0FB12F183314F720"/>
concern for thoſe who have called me to this Service, with freedom and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I know that Perſons of <hi>Military Diſpoſition,</hi> are for engaging in the moſt Noble, and honourable atchievements; but I muſt let them know that ſuch may be corrupted by <hi>Flattery,</hi> to ſerve the worſt of intereſts; thoſe who are beſt furniſhed with Arms, and skill to uſe them, if corrupted by <hi>Flattery,</hi> will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage with the <hi>vileſt of men</hi> to promote their wicked deſigns: It is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God that will ſecure from the guile, fraud, deceit, and flattery of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning men; and fortify the mind to the moſt noble <hi>exploits.</hi> It is obvious in our context, that one man by <hi>Flattery</hi> did prevail to overthrow the Religion, and liberty of the only profeſſing Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God that day on the earth; but thoſe that <hi>know their God,</hi> (and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtedfaſt in his Covenant) ſtopped the carreer of the enemy, and by noble exploits prevailed to recover both; an account of which we have in the books of the <hi>Maccabees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the 20. <hi>verſe</hi> of this Chapter, it is foretold that after the Death of <hi>Antiochus</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:001202_0004_0FB12F19B5530FE0"/>
the great, there ſhould <hi>ſtand up in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate a raiſer of Taxes,</hi> viz. his Son <hi>Seleucus Philopater,</hi> who calling <hi>Money his beſt friend,</hi> ſtuck at nothing though never ſo wicked if thereby he might fill his Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers; amongſt other methods he ſent <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liodorus</hi> to rob the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> but his <hi>beſt friend</hi> could not ſecure him from the Vengeance of Heaven, being in a little time (as ſome write) poyſoned by that very <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liodorus,</hi> whom he had uſed as a tool to ſerve his intereſts.</p>
            <p>After his deceaſe his brother <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> did by <hi>flattery</hi> obtain the Kingdom out of the hands of <hi>Demetrius</hi> his brothers Son; and is ſtiled, <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>a vile perſon</hi>; by ſome called <hi>Epimanes,</hi> a mad man.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Antiochus</hi> finding the methods of guile, flattery, and deceit ſo ſucceſsful, endeavoured by the like artifices, to add <hi>Egypt</hi> to his Territories, and in time of peace he entered into their Provinces, and obtained a vaſt treaſure, which he diſtributed among his confidents to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them to himſelf, and then made further attempts by open force, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, <hi>v.</hi> 24, 25.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:001202_0005_0FB12F1ACDA20168"/>At length meeting with diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he returns to <hi>his own Land;</hi> and vents his malice againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> the Covenant People of God; being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in his malicious deſigns by <hi>Jaſon,</hi> and others who were Apoſtates, and betrayers of their brethren, and the true Worſhip of God; theſe (it ſeems by that expreſſion, <hi>v.</hi> 31. <hi>Arms ſhall ſtand on his part</hi>) were ready to aſſiſt him by force of Arms, to joyn with him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute his intentions when he ſhould give them opportunity.</p>
            <p>In the Words of our Text, (1.) We have an account of the method he took to obtain his end with leaſt hazard, and that was his old, approved way of Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; <hi>viz.</hi> colouring over his wicked deſignes by ſpecious pretences; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to them many advantages, if they would joyn with him.</p>
            <p>(2.) We have the character of thoſe on whom he practiced this his method, <hi>viz.</hi> Such as <hi>dealt wickedly againſt the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;</hi> prophane, debauched profeſſors, like thoſe deſcribed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.17.18, 19. Such as <hi>hated Inſtruction, and caſt the words of God behind them; when they ſaw a thief conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001202_0006_0FB12F1D9E76A138"/>
with him, and were partaker with Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers,</hi> who <hi>gave their mouth to evil, and their tongue framed deceit, they ſat and ſpake againſt their brother, they ſlandered their own mothers ſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(3.) The ſucceſs he had herein, ſuch wicked ones (who appeared to be the <hi>Many, v.</hi> 34.) did he <hi>corrupt by flattery:</hi> it ſeems that ſome leading men, (ſuch as <hi>Jaſon</hi> before mentioned) had a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence to gain over many to their party.</p>
            <p>(4.) But then we have in our Text the character of another ſort of perſons among the <hi>Jews,</hi> whom he could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gain by flattery, nor overcome by force; <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as <hi>knew their God;</hi> who being the oppoſites to thoſe that <hi>dealt wickedly againſt the Covenant,</hi> we may thus deſcribe; they were ſuch, who having the knowledge of God as their God in Covenant, choſe him for their portion, truſted in him for their defence, and cleaved to him with full purpoſe of heart, notwithſtanding the diſtreſſes they were expoſed unto, for being ſtedfaſt in his Covenant.</p>
            <p>(5.) Of theſe it is ſaid, they ſhould <hi>be ſtrong, and do exploits; h. e.</hi> ſhould be ſo
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001202_0007_0FB12F1F914BE6F8"/>
far from yielding to the <hi>Flattery</hi> of the Enemy, that being ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might, ſhould withſtand the fury of the Enemy, in the moſt hazardous ſeaſons, and at length prevail to do great Service for God, in purging his <hi>Temple</hi> which had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed; and recovering (in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) the liberties, and priviledges they had been deprived of. An account of theſe exploits we have in the books of the <hi>Maccabees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Doctrine</hi> to be inſiſted on from the Words, is,
<q>The True Knowledge of God will ſecure from Flattery, and influence to moſt noble ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits, while prophane Profeſſors are corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſerve the worſt of intereſts.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is agreed by Expoſitors that this <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> was a Type of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and the latter part of the Chapter doth manifeſt it; now we know from 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.9, 10. That his coming is <hi>after the working of Satan, with all power, ſignes, and lying won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: and with all deceivableneſs of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in them that periſh: becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001202_0008_0FB12F20EA382E88"/>
not the love of the Truth that they might be Saved: And for this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong Deluſions that they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a Lye: that they all might be Damned, who believed not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteoaſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antichriſt</hi> hath obtained his vaſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire by Deceit, Guile, Hypocriſy, and Diſſimulation; &amp; hath in ſeveral Ages, <hi>Corrupted by Flatteries</hi> multitudes of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Profeſſors, who have believed his Lyes; and joyned with him, and his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters in perpretating the greateſt Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barities, and Cruelties under pretences of Religion; thinking they did God ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice when they killed his Children.</p>
            <p>During this Reign of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> thoſe who <hi>knew their God</hi> have either <hi>Overcome, by the blood of the Lamb, &amp; the word of their Teſtimony, not loving their lives to the death,</hi> Rev. 12.11. Or, when many have <hi>fallen by the Sword, and by Flame, by Captivity, &amp; by Spoil many dayes,</hi> they have been <hi>h<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:001202_0009_0FB12F224C35F618"/>And the time is coming (<hi>haſten it, O my God</hi>) when the Command ſhall be given, Rev. 18.6. <hi>Reward her as ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded you, and double to her double accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her works, in the Cup ſhe hath filled, fill to her double; Then,</hi> O Then! ſhall we more fully underſtand the expreſſion in our Text, <hi>They that know their God, ſhall be ſtrong, and do Exploits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Doctrine may be Cleared, and Proved by the following Propoſitions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>PROP.</hi> I. That the malice of wicked men, is in eſpecial manner ſet againſt the <hi>Holy Covenant of God.</hi> It is ſaid of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> ver. 28. his <hi>heart ſhall be againſt the Holy Covenant;</hi> and ver. 30. he <hi>ſhall have Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt the Holy Covenant;</hi> which Expreſſions import <hi>Malice propenſe,</hi> at laſt breaking forth with rage and fury. With this rage of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> we may compare, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.17. where it is ſaid of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian intereſt, (as under the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Dragon) that he was <hi>wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her Seed, which keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, and have the Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Holy Covenant</hi> mentioned in
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001202_0010_0FB12F26206EE6F8"/>
our Text, and Context comprehends,</p>
            <p n="1">1. All the Holy <hi>Ordinances,</hi> and <hi>Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions</hi> of Divine worſhip which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of his <hi>Saints</hi> who had made <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him by Sacrifice,</hi> Pſal. 50.5. This is evident from ver. 31. And <hi>they ſhall pollute the Sanctuary of ſtrength, &amp; ſhall take away the daily Sacrifice</hi>: And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their malice is intimated in the laſt clauſe of the verſe; <hi>And they ſhall place the abomination that maketh deſolate:</hi> That is, they polluted the Temple, and took away the daily Sacrifice; that they might advance their own Idolatrous Worſhip in the room thereof.</p>
            <p>So under the New Teſtament admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, the malice of the Antichriſtian intereſt is againſt thoſe that <hi>keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, and have the Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> on account of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to his holy Inſtitutions according to the Scripture of Truth; that ſo they may advance their own Superſtition and Idolatry.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The perſons of thoſe that are ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in the Holy Covenant, comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding withall, their Liberties, Priviledges, Eſtates, &amp; whatever elſe is dear to them

               <hi>PROP.</hi> II. That wicked men, in order to accompliſh their deſigns againſt the Worſhip, and People of God, uſually make uſe of Guile, Fraud, Deceit, and <hi>Flattery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the proving of this Propoſition, I ſhall offer the following reaſons to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Satan</hi> who hath in all ages had his influence on all the deſigns of wicked men, againſt the Worſhip and People of God, puts them on the uſe of this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, Rev. 12.9. <hi>The great Dragon, the old
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001202_0012_0FB12F2914D35838"/>
Serpent called the Devil and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world.</hi> He is a <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer</hi> from the beginning; he is a <hi>Liar,</hi> and the Father of it, he obtained his firſt Victory over mankind by <hi>Guile</hi>: 2 Cor. 11.3. <hi>He beguiled Eve,</hi> flattering her with hopes of bettering her condition, Gen. 3.4, 5. And <hi>the Serpent ſaid unto the woman, Ye ſhall not ſurely dye; for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your Eyes ſhall be opened, and ye ſhall be as Gods, knowing Good and Evil.</hi> And we know from 2 Theſ. 2.9, 10. That <hi>Antichriſts coming</hi> is after the <hi>working of Satan, with all power, &amp; ſigns, and lying wonders, and with all deceivableneſs of unrighteouſneſs,</hi> Rev. 13.13, 14. He doth <hi>great wonders</hi> &amp;c. <hi>&amp; deceiveth them that dwell on the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As <hi>Flattery</hi> is an old, approved, and ſucceſsful method, ſo it is apt to produce the deſired effects, eſpecially on the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary multitude: We read of ſome <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Who by good words, and fair ſpeeches deceive the hearts of the ſimple,</hi> who as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> obſerved, <hi>Believe every word,</hi> Prov. 14.15.</p>
            <p>The aptneſs of <hi>Flattery</hi> thus to gain on the hearts of men, appears, (1.) In that
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001202_0013_0FB12F2A8CC4B510"/>
there is in <hi>Flattery</hi> a ſhew of <hi>Love,</hi> friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and good will, which is very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging and obliging. Thus <hi>Abſalom,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.2, 3, 4, 5, 6. By his <hi>kiſſing</hi> of the People, &amp; pretending to do them <hi>Juſtice ſtole the hearts of the people</hi> from his Father <hi>David,</hi> to ſerve his own abmitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes. (2.) This method takes perſons from their <hi>Watch,</hi> their <hi>guard,</hi> and lulls them into a ſecurity: Where can we ſleep more ſecure, than in the embraces of thoſe, that promiſe to nouriſh, cheriſh, and protect us? (3.) This method hath leaſt of hazard to thoſe that uſe it; <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> found it a great deal eaſier to <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Kingdom by flatteries,</hi> than by Swords and Spears: when tis known that men deſign miſchief, thoſe that ſee their danger, are awakened to oppoſe force, with force: and though tis often that the weakeſt go by the Walls, yet there is a hazard; but good words, fair ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, titles of honour, and now &amp; then a ſmall gift to encourage hopes, when the deſignes are accompliſhed, theſe are a <hi>cheap Barter,</hi> when houſes, lands, thrones, crowns and ſcepters are in view. Men of ill deſigns, have guilty Conſciences,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001202_0014_0FB12F2D8DA45710"/>
and faint, cowardly hearts, till Flattery hath given the major part; then they threaten and are full of rage, and fury. It was much eaſier for <hi>Joab</hi> to kill <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> and <hi>Amaſa</hi> under pretence of <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> than by an open defiance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>PROP.</hi> III. Looſe carnal profeſſors, are uſually an eaſy prey to <hi>Flatterers,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.13. <hi>It was told David the hearts of the men of Iſrael are after Abſalom;</hi> It ſeems, he had ſtolen the hearts of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers, and Captains, with the multitude from <hi>David.</hi> We find, <hi>Neh.</hi> 6. <hi>That ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Nobles, Prophets, and Propheteſſes</hi> were corrupted by <hi>Tobiah,</hi> and <hi>Sanballet,</hi> to obſtruct that great man in the Service of his <hi>God.</hi> So it appears by our Text, Context, and the books of <hi>Maccabees,</hi> that many of all ranks of men were thus cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by Flatteries.</p>
            <p>That prophane Profeſſors are an eaſy prey to Flatterers, may appear by the following Reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They taking up <hi>Religion on truſt,</hi> without a perſonal, experimental know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ſweetneſs, pleaſure, Soul ſatisfying delight it affords, find the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Religion <hi>Burthenſome</hi>; and ſay,

What a <hi>Wearineſs is it</hi>? Therefore are ready to hearken to propoſals of riches, pleaſures, and honours, as ſuitable to their inclinations, and deſires. It is ſaid of thoſe that <hi>periſh</hi> by the Antichriſtian deluſions, that <hi>they received not the love of the truth,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.10. <hi>But had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in Unrighteouſneſs</hi>; no wonder if ſuch are ready to comply with the <hi>Mother of harlots,</hi> and <hi>Abominations of the earth;</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſeeing her <hi>Merchants</hi> are the <hi>great men of the earth,</hi> and her <hi>Merchandiſe</hi> is of <hi>Gold, Silver, precious Stones,</hi> &amp;c. Rev. 18.12.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Sin</hi> being ſtill predominant in them, (only under ſome reſtraint by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion) they on the proffers made by <hi>Flatterers,</hi> overcome the <hi>impediment,</hi> and run with more violence to all manner of exceſs, &amp; riot, and their laſt State is worſe than the firſt; as thoſe who have been long kept in, from the gratifying their ſenſual appetites; when once the bridle is taken away, they are <hi>as the ſwift Dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medary traverſing her way in the wilderneſs,</hi> and hate to be controuled.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Holy One in a way of <hi>Juſtice</hi> (for the contempt of his Grace,) doth

by indulging of ſenſual luſts; whole Nations have been debauched, and then fit tools to carry on deſigns to overthrow the Proteſtant Religion, and bring in Popery, and Slavery.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons are obvious.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Satan by their compliance hath an advantage over them to preſs them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to further ungodlineſs; Conſcience is awakened, and they are terrifyed; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction from God is a terrour to them, as knowing they have broken their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and ſo are liable to the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Written; they know they have forfeited their Reputation with thoſe they have deſerted; and now are preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on to a <hi>deſperate rage,</hi> to reject all motions to return: and to ſay as <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.25. <hi>There is no hope, we have loved Strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and after them we will go.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe who <hi>Flattered</hi> them have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage alſo againſt them, (which they know how to improve,) to egg them on to do the worſt of their Drudgery; now they let them know more of their minds. We may conceive them thus ſpeaking to them; <q>Did you not promiſe to be

And do you now decline? If you do, we will take from you all that we gave; we expect ſatisfaction for the wrong you have done us, and you muſt now expect nothing but wrath, we will lay you open to all the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs you can conceive. In ſhort, we muſt have none that halt between two; you have given cauſe to miſtruſt you, if you would gain your Credit with us, and have all the good things we tendred, there is no way but one, and that is by doing one piece of ſervice whereby we may know, <hi>you are true Men</hi>; Come, take an <hi>Oath</hi> againſt ſuch a man; whereby we may get ſuch a part of his intereſt; betray ſuch an one into our hands; or take up Arms, &amp; fight againſt your Prince, and Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</q> And, O to what a dreadful paſs are they then brought! Do they not then ſay? <hi>Our hope is periſhed from the Lord;</hi> our Brethren hate us; and if theſe forſake us we ſhall be Vagabonds

            </p>
            <p>This Propoſition muſt be conſidered with a limitation: It is ſaid, ver. 35. <hi>and ſome of them of underſtanding,</hi> (that is, ſome who know their God,) <hi>ſhall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white.</hi> It pleaſeth the Holy One, ſometimes to ſuffer his own Children to <hi>Yeild,</hi> Comply, &amp; Fall by the influence of Guile, Deceit, Diſſimulation and Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. <hi>Peter,</hi> and thoſe Jews who were with him diſſembled, they walked not uprightly; and <hi>Barnabas was led away with the Diſſimulation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We muſt therefore conſider, that <hi>Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers</hi> in the managing their deſigns, have different methods, and meaſures; ſo there are divers degrees of Corruption, or influences of this Flattery.

or expect from them; at leaſt for the preſent; they have other tools to fit to do the drudgery.

               <hi>Anſw.

They hold the <hi>Myſtery of the Faith in a pure Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Knowledge</hi> may be Explained by the following Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is ſuch a <hi>Knowledge of God</hi> as <hi>their God</hi> in <hi>Covenant;</hi> it implyes their ſeeking all happineſs in and from him: They ſay as, Pſal. 73.25. <hi>I have none in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but thee, and there is none upon Earth that I deſire beſides thee.</hi> He hath made with me <hi>an Everlaſting Covenant ordered in all things, and ſure, this is all my Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and all my Deſire,</hi> 2 Sam. 23.5. <hi>This is Life Eternal to know thee the only

And <hi>we know that the Son of God is come, &amp; hath given us an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jeſus Christ. This is the true God, and Eternal Life.</hi> They that thus <hi>Know God</hi> will <hi>keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from Idols.</hi> They will not forſake the Fountain of Living Waters, for broken Ciſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erns that can hold no Water.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

They that thus <hi>know</hi> their God, will <hi>cleave to him with purpoſe of heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It implyes a <hi>knowledge of God</hi> as the Supream <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>Lawgiver,</hi> who hath the right to diſpoſe of them; they

            <p n="4">4 It implyes the knowledge of him as <hi>Supreme Ruler</hi> and <hi>Governour, whoſe Kingdom ruleth over all:</hi> He is the <hi>Moſt high who liveth for ever whoſe dominion is an everlaſting domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and his Kingdom is from generation to genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And all the inhabitants of the earth are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted as nothing: and he doth according to his Will in the army of heaven, and among the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the earth: and none can ſtay his hand, or ſay unto him: What doeſt thou</hi>?

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. Gen.</hi> In the Holy Scriptures God hath declared, and manifeſted the Glory of <hi>His</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Attributes, and he hath therein ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us the nature, ſtate, condition, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of <hi>Man</hi>: the more then we ſee &amp; know of <hi>God</hi> according to the Scriptures, the more cauſe ſhall we find to fix our <hi>Trust,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on him; and the more we ſee, and know of <hi>Man</hi> (in Scripture light,) the more cauſe ſhall we find to withdraw our depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance from him. We ſhall ſee the higheſt reaſon to <hi>trust in the Lord for ever, for in the Lord Jehovah is Everlaſting ſtrength, he will keep them in perfect peace whoſe mind is ſtayed on him,</hi> Iſa. 26.3, 4. But as to <hi>Man,</hi> we ſhall ſay to our Souls, <hi>Truſt not in Princes, nor the ſon of Man in whom there is no help; his breath goeth forth, he returneth to his Earth; in that very day his thoughts periſh,</hi> Pſal. 146.3.4. We ſhall <hi>ceaſe from Man whoſe breath is in his noſtrils, for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is he to be accounted of</hi>?</p>
            <p>More Particularly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Glorious God whoſe name is, I AM, he only doth <hi>neceſſarily Exiſt</hi>: He hath his being of himſelf, from Everlaſting, to Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting he is God; with him <hi>is no variableneſs
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001202_0025_0FB12F41A1F47970"/>
nor ſhadow of turning,</hi> Jam. 1.17. But vain <hi>Man</hi> wherein is he to be accounted of! Every man walketh <hi>in a vain ſhew; verily every man at his beſt eſtate is altogether vanity,</hi> Pſal. 39.5, 6. Oh! therefore it is better to truſt in the Lord, than to put confidence in Man. <hi>It is better to truſt in the Lord, than to put confidence in Princes,</hi> Pſal. 118.8, 9. <hi>Surely men of low degree are vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp; men of high degree are a lye; to be laid in the the balance they are altogether lighter than vanity; wherefore O my Soul, wait thou only upon God, He only is my Rock, and my Salvation, he is my Defence, I ſhall not be moved,</hi> Pſal. 62.7, 9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Lord our God is <hi>Glorious in Holineſs,</hi> of <hi>Purer</hi> Eyes <hi>than to behold Evil, and cannot look on Iniquity,</hi> Hab. 1.13. <hi>Sin</hi> is that abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable thing he hates; <hi>He is a God of truth, and without iniquity, juſt and right is he</hi>: Deut. 32.4.

            <p>Let man be conſidered in his <hi>carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Neighbours</hi>; his character is given, Pſal. 12.1, 2. <hi>The faithful fail from among the Children of men, they ſpeak vanity every one with his Neighbour; with flattering lips, and a double heart do they ſpeak.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Look into <hi>Families,</hi> and we often ſee the Son at variance againſt his Father, the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter againſt her Mother, and the Daughter in Law againſt her Mother in Law; <hi>a mans foes are thoſe of his own Houſhold,</hi> Mat. 10.36.</p>
            <p>Look into <hi>Religious Societies,</hi> and we there often ſee ſome with good words, and <hi>fair Speeches deceiving the hearts of the ſimple; Wolves</hi> in Sheeps clothing, the <hi>Miniſters of Satan,</hi> transformed into the Miniſters of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; do we not often ſee Diſſentions, Diviſions, Schiſms, Swellings, Tumults, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons biting and devouring one another;</p>

            <p>Beſides all this, how full is the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Warnings, and Cautions againſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying, depending on men, Mat. 10.17. <hi>Beware of men.</hi> Jer. 9.4, 5, 6. <hi>Take ye heed every one of his Neighbour; and trust you not in any Brother; for every Brother will utterly ſupplant; and every Neighbour will walk with ſlanders. And they will deceive every one his Neighbour, &amp; will not ſpeak truth; they have taught their tongue to ſpeak lies, and weary themſelves to commit iniquity: thine habitation is in the midst of deceit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now who is there that reads the Character given of men in the Scripture; and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves how this is manifeſt to their view, and in their own experiences, but will look well to his ſteps, and take heed, and beware of men. But he who <hi>Knows</hi> from the Scripture, and his Experience, that God will never leave, nor forſake thoſe that put their truſt in him; with what boldneſs, and confidence, will they rely on his Word, and truſt in him for ever?</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Knowledge of God ſecures from the influences of <hi>Flattery,</hi> by furniſhing with <hi>Anſwers</hi> to the <hi>Arguments</hi> Flatterers common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe to gain over to their ſide.</p>

               <hi>Quest.</hi> III. How doth this <hi>Knowledge of God</hi> ſtrengthen and influence, to <hi>do Exploits</hi>; or moſt noble Atchievements?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. Gen.</hi> The <hi>Knowledge of God</hi> frees men from thoſe baſe, <hi>low, mean deſigns</hi> they were purſuing in their ſtate of blindneſs and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; and elevates the Soul to the moſt <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Deſigns</hi> that humane Nature is capable of, viz. <hi>that whether they live, they live to God, whether they die they die to him, that living or dying they may be the Lords,</hi> Rom. 14.7 8. A Soul thus <hi>Enabled</hi> will ſcorn what is wicked, baſe, and unworthy; and will ſtudy to pleaſe him who hath called him to be a <hi>Souldier</hi>; will ſay, <q>Let us ſubdue our own Spirits, morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy our Members which are upon the Earth, yea Crucify the old Man with his affections,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001202_0031_0FB12F4C02238028"/>
and luſts. Let us overcome the World, and and live as Crucified to it; Let us put on the whole Armour of God, and prepare to wreſtle with Principalities and Powers; that being ſtrong in the Lord, and the power of his might, we may overcome, and receive the Crown of Life.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Particularly;</p>
            <p n="1">1. The knowledge of God influenceth to the moſt Noble Exploits, by regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their <hi>Choice</hi> of the <hi>Cauſe</hi> in which they engage: thoſe who have the true knowledge of God ſay, with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as 2 Cor. 13.8. <hi>We can do nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Truth, but for the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) The <hi>cauſe</hi> they will chooſe, is, the <hi>cauſe</hi> wherein the <hi>Glory,</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> of God is concerned; that they may in <hi>his Name lift up their banners,</hi> Pſal. 20.5. <hi>A Banner to be diſplayed becauſe of the truth.</hi> Pſal. 60.40. Under which they may Pray, Let <hi>God ariſe, his Enemies be ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and they that hate him flee before him,</hi> Pſal. 68.1. Or as the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 74.22. <hi>Ariſe, plead thine own cauſe, remember how the fooliſh man reproacheth thee dayly.</hi> And what Courage doth it give to the mind
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001202_0032_0FB12F4DD98D61C0"/>
when a perſon is ſatisfyed he is engaged in <hi>Gods Cauſe? The wicked flee when no man purſueth: but the righteous are bold as a Lion,</hi> Prov. 28.1.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The <hi>Cauſe</hi> in which thoſe who know their God will Engage in, is ſuch as wherein being <hi>injured by Men,</hi> they may <hi>appeal to God,</hi> as the Holy Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judge of the whole World, who will do right: As Pſal. 17.1, 2. <hi>Hear the right O Lord! Let my ſentence come forth from thy preſence: let thine Eyes behold the things that are equal. If I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands; if I have rewarded evil to him that was at peace with me, let the Enemy perſecute my Soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down my Life upon the Earth, and lay mine Honour in the Duſt,</hi> Pſal. 7.4, 5. <hi>Judge me O Lord, according to my Righteouſneſs, and according to my Integrity that is in me,</hi> ver. 8. They will appeal to Heaven as <hi>Jephtah,</hi> Judg. 11.27. <hi>I have not ſinned againſt thee, but thou doſt me wrong to War againſt me; the Lord the Judge, be Judge this day between the Children of Iſrael, and the Children of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> And this alſo greatly ſtrengthens, and invigorates the <hi>Mind;</hi> Enabling

them to ſay, <hi>Our help is in the Name of the Lord; in the Lord do I put my truſt; and will not be afraid, what man can do unto me,</hi> Pſal. 56.11.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Knowledge of God</hi> ſtrengthens, and influenceth to the moſt <hi>Noble Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits,</hi> in that thoſe who <hi>know their God</hi> will labour to be ſatisfyed in their <hi>being called by him</hi> to ſuch Service; as <hi>David</hi> enquired of the Lord ſaying, <hi>Shall I go up to the Philiſtines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand</hi>? We read ſometimes of the <hi>choſen men of Iſrael</hi>; It is ſaid of the Souldiers of the Lamb, that they that are with him are <hi>called and choſen, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> Rev. 17.14. Every one is not fitted to be a <hi>Sou<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

Will God cover my head in the day of battel? Will he give his Angels charge concerning me to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve my Life, though thouſands fall
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:001202_0034_0FB12F52A5B5FDE0"/>
on my right hand, and ten thouſand on my left, if I run before I am ſent? ſurely no; he will ſay, <hi>What doſt thou here</hi>?</q> at it was ſaid to <hi>Elijah,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.13. Indeed in ſome caſes the matter is plain and obvious; and <hi>every one</hi> is called to be a <hi>Souldier</hi>; but ordinarily <hi>choſen men,</hi> men Trained up for ſuch Service are thoſe that will <hi>do Exploits</hi>: Men that are ſatisfyed their cauſe is good, and their call clear, will be <hi>Lion like men,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.20. Men of undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted courage, <hi>By their God will they run through a Troop, and leap over a wall,</hi> Pſal. 18.29.</p>
            <p n="3">3. True <hi>Knowledge of God</hi> influenceth to <hi>do Exploits,</hi> in that ſuch as <hi>know their God</hi> will <hi>Offer themſelves willingly</hi> to his Service. It was a Law in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Deut. 20.5. <hi>to</hi> 9. <hi>That thoſe who were fearful, or faint hearted ſhould return, and not go to battel:</hi> So alſo thoſe who had ſuch Worldly affairs and buſineſs as might render them indiſpoſed, or liſtleſs; as having lately Married a Wife: this Law ſhews that they are moſt fit for Service, moſt like to <hi>do Exploits,</hi> who are moſt free, &amp; willing. In the Song
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:001202_0035_0FB12F54599898D8"/>
of <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barak,</hi> Judg. 5.2.9. It is taken notice of as that which did faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate the Victory, <hi>The People willingly offered themſelves; and the Governours of Iſrael offerred themſelves willingly among the People</hi>: Thoſe whom love to God, to his cauſe, and intereſt; love to Juſtice; love to their Country conſtraineth; theſe are men to <hi>do Exploits;</hi> men that are <hi>conſtrained</hi> by others againſt their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and wills, are often (when it comes to Service) but the <hi>Shaddow of men,</hi> men that have no heart; as it was ſaid of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Hoſ. 7.11. He <hi>was like a ſilly dove without an heart,</hi> ready to yield the cauſe without ſtricking a ſtroke: But when the <hi>Princes,</hi> or, (as it may be read) the <hi>Voluntary</hi> of the People are <hi>ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered to the People of the God of Abraham,</hi> Pſal. 47.9. When God makes them wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and their Spirit ſtirs them up, then may we expect to hear of Noble <hi>Exploits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The more they have of the <hi>Knowledge of God</hi> the more fixed will their <hi>Truſt</hi> and Dependance be; Pſal. 9.10. <hi>They that know thy Name, will put their truſt in thee; for thou forſakeſt not them

that ſeek thee.</hi> They that know their God will ſay, <hi>Some truſt in Chariots, and ſome in Horſes; but we will remember the Name of the Lord, our God, and in the Name of our God we will ſet up our Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> Pſal. 20.5, 7. And what <hi>Exploits</hi> will they not do who by Faith truſt in the Name of the Lord? <hi>All things are poſſible to him that Believeth;</hi> This, this is that will cauſe to <hi>wax valiant in Fight,</hi> out of <hi>Weakneſs will make Strong;</hi> it will <hi>ſubdue Kingdoms,</hi> and turn <hi>to Flight the Armies of the Aliens,</hi> Heb. 11.33, 34 This, will make <hi>One Chaſe a Thouſand, and Two to put Ten Thouſand to Flight,</hi> Deut. 32.30. O what a Noble Exploit was that of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> and his Armour-bearer? 1 Sam. 14.1. It was <hi>Faith</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced to that Exploit, ver. 6. <hi>Come let us go over to the Garriſon of theſe Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed, it may be the Lord will work for us; for there is no reſtraint to the Lord to ſave by many, or by few. Few</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, for thoſe <hi>Two</hi> were the occaſion of the Overthrow of all the Army of the Philiſtines; and who can tell, how many Thouſands it conſiſted of? Sure the Army was very great; for when

they trembled, the Earth did quake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for it was a very <hi>great Trembling,</hi> ver. 15.

            <p n="5">5. The more <hi>Knowledge of God</hi> as their God in Covenant, the leſs of <hi>anxious ſolicitude about the Event.</hi> They caſt their Care on God, who careth for them; are <hi>careful for nothing</hi>: God hath ſaid concerning the Righteous, <hi>It ſhall be well with him;</hi> and they know it ſhall be well with <hi>them that fear God, which fear before him,</hi> Eccl. 8.12. <hi>All things work together for good to them that love God,</hi> Rom. 8.28. It doth greatly diſpirit, and unfit for Action, when the mind is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully divided, with a concern about the Event; but when a perſon can ſay, <hi>Here I am, let him do what ſeemeth him good,</hi> he goes on with Courage. The Lord is their <hi>Rock, Fortreſs, and high Tower.</hi> To him they commit their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and Intereſts; their <hi>Times</hi> are in

his Hand; and they know, till their hour is come, none ſhall hurt them; they commit the <hi>keeping of their Souls to him in well doing, as into the Hands of a Faithful Creator,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.19. They look on <hi>Death</hi> as a <hi>Conquered Enemy</hi>; and in the midſt of Swords, and Spears, and Guns can ſay, O <hi>Death, where is thy Sting</hi>? O <hi>Grave, where is thy Victory?</hi> Thoſe that can look beyond Death to an Inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away; to a Crown, an Eternal weight of Glory; Theſe, theſe are the men prepared, fit to <hi>do Exploits;</hi> will ſay, <hi>Thro' God we ſhall do Valiantly</hi>; for <hi>he it is that ſhall tread down out Enemies,</hi> Pſal. 60.12.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The <hi>Knowledge of God</hi> influenceth to <hi>do Exploits,</hi> in that it furniſheth with <hi>Anſwers</hi> againſt whatever may ariſe to diſcourage them. Thoſe who would <hi>do Exploits</hi> meet with many <hi>Objections</hi>; Poſſibly they hear the <hi>Enemies</hi> inſulting and ſaying, <hi>Let not thy God in whom thou truſteſt deceive thee, ſaying, Jeruſalem ſhall not be given into the hands of the King of Aſſyria,</hi> Iſa. 37.10.

Therefore ſhall the Lord, the Lord of Hoſts ſend among his Fat ones leanneſs, and under his Glory he ſhall kindle a burning of Fire; and the light of Iſrael ſhall be for a Fire, and his Holy One for a Flame: and it ſhall burn and devour his Thorns, and Briars in one day; and ſhall conſume the Glory of his Forreſt, and of his fruitful Field, both Soul, and Body, and they ſhall be as when a Standard beareth fainteth, Iſa. 10.18.</q> They, they that <hi>Know their God,</hi> and have thus in readineſs to anſwer the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults of the Enemy, are fit to do Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits. And I hope when God hath performed his whole Work, by the Rod of his Anger; this Prophecy will be fulfilled again, on the Blaſphemous, Proud, and Haughty Monarch of <hi>France.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:001202_0041_0FB12F5FCDCEDDC8"/>We come now to Apply the DO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CTRINE. And hence we Infer:</p>
            <p n="1">I. Are Prophane Profeſſors eaſily Corrupted by <hi>Flattery,</hi> then how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle are ſuch to be relyed on? A ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til <hi>Flatterer,</hi> whoſe words are ſmoother than Butter, and ſofter than Oyl, may gain over thouſands to his ſide; eſpecially when he hath opportunity and advantage to propoſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe Riches, Honours and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of the Children of men, what dependance can there be on thoſe who <hi>profeſs to know God, but in works deny</hi> him, being abominable, and to every good work Reprobate. They are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able on every Temptation to deſert the Cauſe of God, and to run over to the Camp of <hi>Antichriſt</hi>: As the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> (1 Joh. 2.19.) ſaith of ſome, <hi>They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:001202_0042_0FB12F618A438C58"/>
with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifeſt that they were not all of us.</hi> Perſons are apt to boaſt of their <hi>Numbers,</hi> but in our compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation we ſhould reckon thoſe that are <hi>True men</hi>; Perſons that are of a double Heart, and double Tongues, Perſons that do wickedly againſt the Covenant (wherein they have lain themſelves under higheſt engagements to God,) will prove <hi>Deſerters,</hi> when there is a proſpect of more advantage by joyning with the Enemy: It is in this caſe as it was in the Camp of <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon,</hi> Judg. 7.3. there were but ten thouſand left, of thirty two thouſand. So in the caſe to which our Text re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, there were but very <hi>Few</hi> that remained Faithful. It is ſaid, Dan. 11.34. <hi>They ſhall be holpen with a little help</hi>: which refers to <hi>Mattathias,</hi> and his Sons, and what they did; the many, the multitude, were Corrupted by Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries; therefore it is no wonder to ſee perſons who are Prophane Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:001202_0043_0FB12F62CC8C3C08"/>
Sabbath-breakers, Contemners of the Ordinances of God, Drunkards, Unclean perſons, the Ambitious, and Covetous complying with thoſe who propoſe the full gratification of their Luſts.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Second USE is by way of <hi>Caution,</hi> and that more Generally, and Particularly.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I. Caution.</hi> Let all take heed, and beware of <hi>Flattery</hi>; and that;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Take heed of <hi>Self-flattery</hi>; we read, Prov. 28.26. <hi>He that truſteth his own Heart is a Fool.</hi> And of ſome who were evidently wicked, (for their tranſgreſſions declared there was no fear of God before their Eyes;) <hi>yet they flattered themſelves in their own Eyes</hi>; they pleaſed themſelves with ungrounded hopes that their ſtate and condition was good; tho they went on in a courſe of Sin; it refers to
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:001202_0044_0FB12F663A37D6D0"/>
prophane Profeſſors, ſuch as heard the Word but did it not. I know the Text refers to being flattered by others; yet this Caution is ſuitable to our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, for he that hath the cleareſt view of the unſearchable depth of deceit, and wickedneſs of his <hi>own Heart;</hi> who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a jealouſy over his own Spirit; will be moſt cautious leſt he be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on by <hi>others</hi>; thoſe who after frequent <hi>Self-Examination,</hi> comparing themſelves with the Scriptures of truth, have good hopes through Grace that their Hearts are upright with God, will be Praying that they may not be <hi>led into Temptation</hi>; that integrity, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs may preſerve them; and <hi>with the upright God will ſhew himſelf upright,</hi> Pſal. 18.25. Let this then be our care, that there be <hi>Truth in the inward parts, that in the hidden part God hath made us to know wiſdom,</hi> Pſal. 51.6.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us take heed we are not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by <hi>Others.</hi> It is the advice of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 20.19. <hi>Meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips</hi>; as alſo, <hi>Chap.</hi> 26.25. <hi>When he ſpeaketh fair, believe
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:001202_0045_0FB12F68D5F0FD38"/>
him not, for there are ſeven abominations in his heart.</hi> This might be improved to Caution againſt thoſe who would thro' ſubtilty <hi>Corrupt our minds from the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Goſpel,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.3. There are multitudes of deceivers this day in the World who would corrupt the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the Goſpel; &amp; who would mingle their own <hi>Inventions</hi> with the pure Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of CHRIST; many Cautions are given in the holy Scriptures againſt this ſort of men; and we had need to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware; a <hi>Little yielding</hi> in ſuch matters makes way for further corruption: But our Caution reſpects ſuch flattery as tends to corrupt, deprave, and at length to gain over to ſerve a <hi>Wicked Intereſt,</hi> either in Church or State: The Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Priviledges of the <hi>Jews</hi> were overthrown by thoſe who deſerted the <hi>Covenant of God,</hi> and clave to <hi>Antiochus</hi> by <hi>Flatteries.</hi> We had need to beware, if we conſider the evil of the preſent day; Iniquity abounds, and the love of many waxeth cold. Is there not cauſe to Pray, as Pſal. 12.1, 2. <hi>Help Lord! for the Godly man ceaſeth, for the faithful fail from among the Children of men:
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:001202_0046_0FB12F6A7A9A74E8"/>
They ſpeak vanity every one with his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with flattering lips, and a double heart do they ſpeak,</hi> or as it expreſſed, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.2. <hi>The good man is periſhed out of the earth,</hi> v. 5, 6, 7. <hi>Truſt ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide,</hi> &amp;c. O what ſad reaſon is there to renew the old com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, <hi>Job</hi> 6.15. <hi>My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the ſtream of brooks they paſs away</hi>: Or that Pſal. 55.12, 13. <hi>It was not an enemy that reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, but it was thou a man, mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance; we took ſweet counſel together, and walked unto the houſe of God in company.</hi> If we look unto particular perſons, how many Tears may we ſee; how many ſighs, groanes, and ſad complaints may we hear? <q>Such and ſuch pretended friendſhip, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed relief, ſupport, and comfort, till they got me into their ſnares, nets, and gins, and then they made a prey of me; and now are grown rich by the ſpoils they got from me.</q> If we look into the World, and conſider the exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant power, and greatneſs of <hi>France;</hi> what Kingdoms, Provinces, and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities have been added to his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:001202_0047_0FB12F6BECD9C408"/>
and enquire, <hi>whence all this Glory?</hi> muſt it not be anſwered, he hath obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and maintained them by <hi>Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi>; how many hath he corrupted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by? Many of the great, and mighty in the Courts of his Neighbours who have been of more Service then his Arms. In particular, could he have rooted out ſo many hundred thouſands of his own Proteſtant Subjects; had he not firſt <hi>Flattered</hi> them with Oaths, Covenants, and Promiſes whereby their Religion, and Liberty (as they thought) were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to them, and ſo were lulled aſleep neglecting the uſe of means for their preſervation? till they have ſeen their Temples polluted, and deſtroyed; many thouſands driven to the remote parts of the earth; many hundreds of thouſands dragooned into a compliance with Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Idolatry; vaſt multitudes deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and their Children trained up in Popery.</p>
            <p>If we conſider, what our <hi>Indian</hi> Neighbours (under the influence of <hi>Popiſh Prieſts</hi> have done to us;) Did they not <hi>Flatter</hi> us with Promiſes, of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Peace; a Peace to continue as
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:001202_0048_0FB12F6DF48557D0"/>
long as <hi>Sun</hi> &amp; <hi>Moon</hi> endure, &amp; then before many Changes of the <hi>Moon</hi> treacherouſly, and barbarouſly fall on our Neighbours, killing many, and carrying others into a miſerable Captivity; and there allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and flattering many over to their Superſtition and Idolatry: and who knows what tools ſome ſuch may be of miſchief, if God do not mercifully prevent? Surely upon the whole, we have reaſon to take heed we be not flattered.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second,</hi> and more Particular Branch of the <hi>Caution</hi> reſpects thoſe who are diſpoſed to <hi>Military Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes,</hi> who by skill in the Art of <hi>War,</hi> propoſe a being fitted for ſervice, that when they are called to it, they may not be at a loſs how to uſe their Weapons, but may employ them to the beſt advantage. To preſs this Caution, I ſhall offer to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; That perſons of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous deſigns look on them as the moſt likely to oppoſe, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their proceedings: Or on the
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:001202_0049_0FB12F7185FC3618"/>
other hand, (if they can gain them) to ſerve their turns. Now (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we obſerved,) <hi>Flattery</hi> is the method they commonly uſe, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving leſs hazard than to provoke them to meet them, with <hi>their Swords</hi> drawn; if by <hi>Flattery</hi> they can keep their Swords in their Scab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards, when they ſhould be in their Hands; or if they can by <hi>Flattery,</hi> (and a Gift to blind their Eyes) perſwade them to uſe their weapons to ſerve their turns; they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered them. How many Leaders, and Commanders in Fleets, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies have thus been Corrupted to a <hi>Neutrality</hi>; or gained to ſerve the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy</hi>? Beſides <hi>Flatterers</hi> are <hi>Politick</hi>; conſider with whom they have to do; they know thoſe who are diſpoſed to learn the <hi>Military Art,</hi> are commonly men of great ſpirits, who aim high; &amp; therefore they propoſe <hi>Honours,</hi> &amp; <hi>Preferments</hi> to them; thus ſuiting the bait to their inclinations, often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:001202_0050_0FB12F740FA24608"/>
upon them; therefore they had need to keep a ſtrict Guard over their own ſpirits.</p>
            <p>The Third USE is, by way of <hi>Exhortation,</hi> and <hi>Advice</hi> in eſpecial to the GENTLEMEN in ARMS.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Much Honoured Gentlemen,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT hath pleaſed the Glorious GOD to favour you with his Holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; You have had the means of Inſtruction; and I hope there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you who having the Saving <hi>Knowledge of God</hi> in Chriſt Jeſus as your God in Covenant; have Devoted your ſelves to his Service; to Serve his Will in your Generation; and that tho' you would do injury to none; Yet if it pleaſeth the Holy One, the Lord of Hoſts to call you to jeopard your Lives in the High Places of the Field; You would be among thoſe who <hi>Offer your ſelves
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:001202_0051_0FB12F75AEFACF48"/>
willingly,</hi> to ſerve the intereſt of God, and your Countrey againſt Unjuſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaders. The Advice then I would give is, that you would increaſe more, and more in the <hi>Knowledge of God</hi>; that being ſtrong in the Lord, and in the Power of his Might, you may be prepared, and ready for Service, that you may be ſtrong, and do <hi>Exploits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Conſideration of the ſtate of things in <hi>Europe,</hi> calls upon us both to be Expert for <hi>War,</hi> and to be Ready for Service: You all know that our Nation, is Engaged in a <hi>Juſt War</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Proud, Haughty, Blaſphemer, Perſecutor, and Diſtuurber of the Common Peace: And tho' we have cauſe to be very Thankful for the <hi>Victories</hi> obtained by the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, and our Nation in particular; Yet who can tell when the Sword will be put into the Scabbard; and what Service we may be called unto?</p>
            <p>And the ſtate of things in <hi>this Land</hi> alſo calls for being alwayes ready;
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:001202_0052_0FB12F77116D8858"/>
You all know the hazard our Outward Plantations are continually in, of being aſſaulted by our Treacherous, and Bloody Enemies: We muſt indeed acknowledge the Favour of God in granting ſuch Conduct to His Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency our GOVERNOUR, that hath prevented unſpeakable Miſchief; and done much Good; Yet how many are ſtill in Danger? Even as much as Flocks of Sheep are of Ravening Wolves; therefore ſhould every one <hi>be ready.</hi> Beſides, you know how much this Town in particular is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Attacques of the Enemy by Sea. The laſt Alarm ſhews, that if an Enemy have the advantage of Wind &amp; Tyde, how ſoon they may be upon us; therefore we ſhould be alwayes ready.</p>
            <p>But inaſmuch, it is the <hi>Knowledge of GOD,</hi> that influence <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to do the moſt Noble <hi>Exploits</hi>; we ſhall Conclude with ſome Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice with reſpect thereto.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="unknown:001202_0053_0FB12F7AA53FB0B8"/>
               <hi>Much Honoured;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Would you be ready to <hi>do Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits</hi>?</p>
            <p>Firſt; <hi>Study CHRIST and him Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified</hi>; and let the Knowledge of him Engage you to mortifie your Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that are upon the Earth, to <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify the Old man, with its affections, &amp; luſts</hi>: The Scripture ſaith, <hi>He that is ſlow to anger, is better than the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and he that ruleth his ſpirit, than he that taketh a city,</hi> Prov. 16.3, 21. Oh! Learn of him, he is Meek, and Lowly; ſuch Graces will preſerve you from miſapplying your skill; from giving unjuſt provocation to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and yet will Engage you to follow him whitherſoever he goeth; and to do what ſervice he requires of you.</p>
            <p>Secondly; <hi>Study CHRIST, and him Exalted.</hi> He is <hi>King of Kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord of Lords</hi>; Angels, Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:001202_0054_0FB12F7CD8068340"/>
and Powers are made ſubject to him; He Reigns till all his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies become his Footſtool; He is given to be a <hi>Leader, and Commander to his People,</hi> Iſa. 55.4. Therefore let <hi>Iſrael rejoyce in him that made them,</hi> and <hi>the Children of Zion be joyful in their King,</hi> Pſal. 149.2. Therefore be looking to JESUS, the Author and Finiſher of our Faith; whoſe Grace is ſufficient for you, who will fit you for the ſervice to which he calleth you; and remember he that is the Faithful and True Witneſs hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged all his with that Gracious Promiſe; <hi>Be thou Faithful unto Death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life,</hi> Rev. 2.10.</p>
            <p>Thirdly; <hi>Study the Scripture Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies.</hi> Tho there are <hi>Depths</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we cannot find out; muſt leave to the Holy One who hath reſerved the times, and ſeaſons in his own Power; Yet as far is he hath Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, we ſhould Read, and Pray
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:001202_0055_0FB12F7DCEDE7908"/>
that we may ſo underſtand the times, as to <hi>know what we ought to do.</hi> It ſeems as if the time to Execute the Judgments written on <hi>Antichriſt</hi> were at hand; the time when the <hi>Kings of the Earth ſhall hate the Whole, and burn her Fleſh as it were with fire</hi>; when the Lamb ſhall Overcome; and they that are with him are <hi>Called, &amp; Choſen, &amp; Faithful</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Rev. 17.14. Who knows what the preſent Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may iſſue in? I would hope that if the Year of Recompences for the Controverſy of <hi>Zion</hi> be not come, it is <hi>near at hand,</hi> when the Command ſhall be given, Reward her as ſhe hath rewarded you.
