            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEREAS there hath late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been publiſhed in <hi>Boſton</hi> a Pamphlet, Entituled, <hi>An Account of the Reaſons why a conſiderable Number of the New North Congregation in</hi> Boſton, <hi>could not conſent to Mr.</hi> Peter Thacher's <hi>Ordination there,</hi> &amp;c.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt thoſe who make it evident to the World, that they are endeavouring to hurt us in our beſt and moſt valuable intereſts.</p>
            <p>In order to our Vindication, we ſhall recite ſome of the moſt material paſſages mentioned in the ſaid Pamphlet, relating to our Conduct, and ſet thoſe proceedings of ours in a true Light.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, We find them aſſerting, That a Number of the Members of our Church did uſe underhand practices to Rob <hi>Weymouth,</hi> and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Miniſter on <hi>Boſton;</hi> which thing has been much talked of, and we thought we had done enough to prevent its being improved againſt us any more; for at a Church Meeting, where moſt of the diſſatisfyed Brethren were preſent, that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was throughly debated, and every one that could be in the leaſt ſuſpected, declared they never were concerned, directly nor indirectly, by writing, or by any other means whatſoever, to invite Mr. <hi>Thacher</hi> to leave <hi>Weymouth</hi> and come to us. After theſe things were fairly and fully debated, it was propoſed by our Reverend Paſtor, that if we were in Charity with each other on that account, we ſhould expreſs it by lifting up our hands, which we concluded every one did; and we challenge any perſon in the world to prove, that ever any of the Members of our Church have been guilty of what they have charged them with in this Affair.</p>
            <p>As to what they alledge of their being fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly dealt with (<hi>page</hi> 5, 6.) and being cut off from the benefit of a Vore we paſſed the <hi>13th</hi> of
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002186_0003_10030CDE0D9422A0"/>
               <hi>May</hi> in favour of the Congregation; we ſay, that this one thing ſet in a due light, we can't but think ſilenceth one great clamour of our Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, <hi>viz.</hi> Oppreſſion; for this Vote was propoſed and come into purely in indulgence to them, and to make them ſenſible we would do our utmoſt we could to quiet them and make them eaſy.</p>
            <p>As to their being cut off from the Liberty gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them in that Vote by an Obligation, which they ſay was tacked to it; We reply, that the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation ſo much complained of is plainly implyed in the Vote, for that is founded on the Liberty given by the Province Law to the Congregations in the Country; and the reaſon why the Vote was not fully compleated at this Meeting was, we could not determine the Bounds of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore deferred it till we had conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſome of the chief of the Congregation; and then it was determined that all the conſtant Hearers and Contributers ſhould be allowed the priviledge of a Vote, that would come under ſuch an Obligation, which was no more than only a promiſe, That they would do their part towards the Support of the Miniſtry, ſo long as God in his Providence continued them in that place, which was ſigned by a conſiderable Number who did actually Vote in the Choice, and it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable and groundleſs Jealouſies that hindered the diſſatisfy'd from coming into it.</p>
            <p>As to a pretended promiſe made by the Rev. Mr. <hi>Webb,</hi> that they ſhould ſee Mr. <hi>Thacher</hi>'s Diſmiſſion, ſigned by the major part of the Church of <hi>Weymouth</hi> before we proceeded further; and that it was promiſed ſome of the Church ſhould go to <hi>Weymouth</hi> and bring it; We reply, that we
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002186_0004_10030CE155AAC4A8"/>remember it was moved by them, but Mr. <hi>Webb</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd to their propoſal, that it was not reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nor practicable according to Cuſtom in ſuch caſes, but that they ſhould ſee a Diſmiſſion in uſual Form, and ſuch a Diſmiſſion we according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly produced and offered, at the time when they were called to concur with the Church in the Choice.</p>
            <p>Again, we find aſſerted, (<hi>page</hi> 12.) That we choſe Mr. <hi>Thacher</hi> to be our Miniſter when he was the Miniſter of <hi>Weymouth,</hi> which we declare to be a poſitive Falſhood; and can prove, that Mr. <hi>Thacher</hi> had his Diſmiſſion from his Paſtoral Relation to the Church of <hi>Weymonth</hi> by a Vote of that Church the 23d of <hi>February,</hi> 1718, 19, and that another Paſtor, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Pain,</hi> was choſen both by Church and Town, and had actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally taken Charge of the Pulpit before Mr <hi>Thacher</hi> left them, and was ordained in his room before we made choice of him to be our Paſtor which was on the <hi>9th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> 1719. And now the Church of <hi>Weymouth</hi> being ſettled underſano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paſtor, they diſmiſt Mr. <hi>Thacher</hi> at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, as a Member, and gave him a Letter of Recommendation, wherein they ſay, <hi>That his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with them had been as becometh the Goſpel, and that they parted with him in perfect Charity;</hi> for which there was a full Vote in the Church, and not one Perſon objected againſt it, as ſome of us were aſſur'd by the preſent Reverend Paſtor of that Church; tho' we find it aſſerted (<hi>page</hi> 36.) they can prove it was a lean Vote, and objections made againſt the Recommendation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:002186_0004_10030CE155AAC4A8"/>
Again, We find them by way of <hi>Query (page</hi> 28.) asking, <hi>Whether Mr.</hi> Thacher <hi>did not ſend a Letter, and charge the Church not to conſent to a Council, or deſire ſome Friend to do it for him, for ſuch a Letter there was, and it had its Influence.</hi> This we declare to be a poſitive Faſhood; for our Church as a Body, nor any ſingle Member of it, as we know of, ever received any ſuch Letter from Mr. <hi>Thacher,</hi> or any other perſon in the World; nor ever had the leaſt hint there was ſuch a Letter, 'till we found it aſſerted in the Pamplet.</p>
            <p>There are many more Notorious Falſhoods in the forenamed Pamphlet, which we think it not needful for us to anſwer, ſince we know not the Author; and thoſe Particulars which we have already anſwer'd are the foundation of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy; and we have no proſpect of its being ended, tho' we ſhould anſwer every Particular.</p>
            <p>And we hope no ſerious Chriſtian will juſtify that Pamphlet, which appears to be written with ſo much Heat and Anger; for it's evident, that the force and ſtrength of its Rage is levelled at our Miniſters; and what can the deſign of this be, but to render their Labours unſucceſsful, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice People againſt them? If this be their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and they ſhould in the leaſt obtain their end, certainly without deep Repentance and Sorrow for ſuch Sins, dreadful muſt be the Account which ſuch perſons will have to give up another Day. Our Miniſters are very dear to us, and ſome of us can very truly, and we hope very feelingly ſay that we have cauſe to bleſs God for them; and we truſt there are great Numbers in the Town that have a great affection for them, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable

               </gap>per and Carriage in the forecited Pamphlet, in which they very particularly bid the Readers to enquire with what a Temper Mr. <hi>Thacher</hi> acted upon his admiſſion into the Church, to whom (if any ſhould enquire) we ſhould be glad of the opportunity to relate; Namely, That it was with great Meekneſs he addreſſed himſelf to the Church at that time; and his Expreſſions were ſo Chriſtian, and in ſo moving a manner, as affected the greater part (we believe all, except thoſe few who oppoſed him) and they being the perſons to whom he chiefly apply'd, it was very ſurpriſing to all the the reſt, that they were no more affected with it.</p>
            <p>They charge the Reverend Mr. <hi>Webb</hi> with parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality in our Meetings in reproving Sharply thoſe who were not of his mind, and not reproving thoſe who were, when they ſpake unbecomingly; we can truly ſay, we Never once obſerved it to be ſo; but always to the contrary, Exhorting us all to a Chriſtian Temper one towards another; and when he ſaw any thing otherwiſe with a great deal of meekneſs and moderation Adminiſtred a reproof to one as well as to another; and in all the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our affairs carryed it with the ſame tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the diſſatisfyed as he did at the Meeting-Houſe when the Reverend Mr. <hi>Thacher</hi> was Inſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; and what his behaviour towards them was at that time and their carriage towards him, we
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002186_0005_10030CE326253E58"/>leave to the many hundreds then preſent to judge. And both our Paſtors have always preſt it upon us to ſtudy the things that make for peace, and to overlook whatever Ill treatment we met with from thoſe who diſſented from us; and we hope we have endeavoured to obſerve thoſe directions, and ſtill are inclined ſo to do; and can truly ſay, it is and always hath been a great grie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
