            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.
      </p>
         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>
                  <hi>PROV. XVII. XXVII.</hi>
               </bibl>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT was a Sharp, and yet a Just, Rebuke which the Rash and Wild Zeal of Our Lords own Disciples, once brought upon Them, in <hi>Luc.</hi> 9. 55. <hi>Yee know not what manner of Spirit yee are of.</hi> As 'tis not easy for a man to pass a Judgement upon his own <hi>Picture,</hi> So for a man to know his own <hi>Spirit,</hi> is a thing no less <hi>Difficult,</hi> than it is <hi>Uncommon</hi> in the world. Men may Dream that they have, no less a thing, than <hi>The Powerful or Glorious Spirit of Elias</hi> in them, when indeed, those <hi>Evil Spirits,</hi> which filled and acted the <hi>Swine</hi> of old, have possession of them. It is the <hi>Spirit</hi> of man, whereof he that <hi>Formed</hi> it, hath said, <hi>It is Deceitful above all things, who can
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:000623_0008_0FA95ED4C07821E8"/>
know it?</hi> And therefore that Counsil of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Try the Spirits,</hi> is of a very wonderful importance to us all; Especially with refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto <hi>Our own.</hi> But if that be a Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which would puzzle the most among us, <hi>What Spirit are you of?</hi> There is another Question, which is not altogether so intricate, so perplexed; Namely, <hi>What Spirit we should be of?</hi> It is a Question, whereto we have an Answer, in the Text now Read unto us. We are told in <hi>Prov.</hi> 12. 26. <hi>The Righteous is more excellent than his Neighbour.</hi> And our Text showes, Wherein? tis in the <hi>Spirit</hi> of him.</p>
            <p>If the very <hi>Title</hi> of the <hi>Proverbs</hi> in our Bibles, did not intimate, that they were <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Sentences,</hi> yet the <hi>Author,</hi> the <hi>Pen-Man,</hi> the <hi>Matter,</hi> and the <hi>Te<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ure,</hi> would all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire to declare their being so. It is then an <hi>Excellent Sentence</hi> which now lies before us; and an <hi>Excellent Spirit</hi> is the thing recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in it. We are told in I <hi>King.</hi> 10 24. <hi>All the earth sought unto</hi> Solomon, <hi>to hear his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which God had put into his Heart.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, something of that <hi>Wisdome</hi> now seeks unto a Little <hi>Part of the earth</hi> within these walls this day, that we would attend unto it.</p>
            <p>Wee have here a description of a <hi>Wise Man,</hi> which the only <hi>Wise GOD put into the Heart,</hi> of One that was himself such a Man. To be too Sollicitous and Inquisitive after the Aspect,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000623_0009_0FA95ED4D41D3350"/>
which these words may bear unto the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, will be to forget the Independency of the Sacred <hi>Proverbs,</hi> which rather ly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like an heap of <hi>Unstrung Pearls,</hi> in the Book of our GOD. Nevertheless, tis plain that <hi>Solomon</hi> is here commending the <hi>Taciturnity,</hi> which Wise Men usually have a kindness for; and we have this, assigned as the <hi>Reason</hi> of the <hi>Silence,</hi> that is affected by such Men as those; Particularly, when they receive great provocations from their Injurious Neighbours, and are punished, even for their <hi>Justice,</hi> or <hi>Strucken</hi> for their <hi>Equity;</hi> How come they to be <hi>Sparing of their words!</hi> Why, they are of an <hi>Excellent Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But referring all those Observations, which may be made upon the <hi>Circumstances</hi> of this Text, unto the place most proper for them, I shall, with Gods Help, Address my Self to Answer this most important CASE. <hi>What is that</hi> EXCELLENT SPIRIT, <hi>which a Good man desires, &amp; studies to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with!</hi>

            <p>Divines of some Note, have still wished for Sermons, whose <hi>Motto's</hi> might be, <hi>Many Truth's, and not many words.</hi> It would be disagreeable to the Composure of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs</hi> from whence my Text is taken, and my <hi>Context</hi> would give me a very particular

Check if I should not Croud what is to be said upon this <hi>Case,</hi> into as <hi>Little Room</hi> as ever I can. To Discourse Closely then,</p>
            <p>By the <hi>Spirit,</hi> is meant the <hi>Soul;</hi> Or, that Spiritual and Rational <hi>Substance,</hi> whereto our <hi>Body</hi> is to be Vitally United, as a <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> and an <hi>Engine</hi> for it. By the <hi>Excellency</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> is meant some <hi>Ornament</hi> upon the Soul, which may be grateful unto the most High God, and graceful in the Eyes of all Reasonable men. We are therefore to Enquire, What are those <hi>Ornaments,</hi> with which a Good man would have his own <hi>Soul</hi> Accomplished?</p>
            <p>Know then,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> An <hi>Excellent Spirit</hi> is an E<hi>xtraordinary Spirit;</hi> and such would a Good man have his own <hi>Spirit</hi> arise to be. We Look upon <hi>Rarity</hi> and <hi>Excellency</hi> to be AEquivalent Why, a <hi>Good</hi> man will always be a <hi>Rare</hi> man, as long as almost the whole <hi>World Lies in Wickedness;</hi> But he will further aspire after those <hi>Rare</hi> Attainments, which even many a <hi>Good</hi> man do's not arrive unto. No, he would in all that is Vertuous and Laudable be, <hi>An Extraordinary man.</hi> There is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable <hi>Singularity</hi> Endeavoured by such a man; and he will not be <hi>Bark'd</hi> out of it, by such Flouts and Scoffs, as they some times assaulted the Great <hi>Luther</hi> with, <hi>Tune

Solns Sapis?</hi> Is there no Wit, no Sense a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Mankind, but what <hi>you</hi> have mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polized? A Good man, will not oblige himself unto the Common measures of <hi>Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> There are <hi>Ordinary Vices,</hi> which, be sure, a Good man will not comply withal; he ha's not a <hi>Spirit</hi> that will permit him, <hi>To follow a multitude in the Doing of evil:</hi> if he dwell in a <hi>Sodom,</hi> hell be a <hi>Lot</hi> for all. When the whole Congregation had been Sinning against God, said the Lord in Num. 14.24. <hi>My Servant Caleb, he had another Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and hath followed me fully.</hi> Tis that <hi>other Spirit,</hi> that is an <hi>Excellent Spirit.</hi> Suppose, a Whole Country, yea, a whole Nation, be distempered with Formality, Debauchery, and Enmity against the <hi>Right wayes of the Lord,</hi> a Good man will be of <hi>Another Spirit;</hi> although like E<hi>lias</hi> he be put upon Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, <hi>I am left alone!</hi> If a whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple decline and back-slide from God, and let the <hi>World</hi> eat up all their <hi>Zeal for the House of the Lord;</hi> Yet a Good man will be of <hi>Another Spirit;</hi> hee'l be another <hi>Noah</hi> for his Uprightness, though there be a <hi>Deluge</hi> of Profaneness, overwhelming of all his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood. He is one bound for Heaven; and thinks he, <hi>To heaven Il'e go, though I should not have one man alive, to bear me Company.</hi> But there are <hi>Ordinary Vertues</hi> too, with
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000623_0012_0FA95ED71C27EE78"/>
which a Good man will not be Satisfy'd; he will ingenuously confess himself to be, <hi>The least of Saints;</hi> but he will diligently La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be one of the <hi>Highest Form;</hi> to be <hi>Ultimus Bonorum,</hi>

               </gap>ill not serve his turn; he ha's a <hi>Spirit</hi> suited by that Advice of the Apostle, <hi>Seek that ye may Excel.</hi> Said our Lord, in Math.5.47. <hi>What do you more than others?</hi> Tis a Spirit for <hi>Doing more than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> that is the <hi>Excellent Spirit.</hi> To Live Soberly, and Honestly, Doing no body any Harm, and to keep up a Round of Duties from Sabbath to Lecture, and from Lecture to Sabbath, here is what <hi>others,</hi> that are none of the worst, use to do; but a Good man is for <hi>Doing more than others.</hi> He is for Doing <hi>Nobler things</hi> than they do; and for doing the same things which they do, upon far <hi>Nobler ends.</hi> As for <hi>Natural</hi> Actions; his Eating, Drinking, Sleeping, and Recreation; tis not meerly because he is <hi>Hungry, Thirsty, Weary,</hi> and his <hi>Appetites</hi> call for it; this is what <hi>others do;</hi> No, but it is, that so he may be Supported and Refreshed in the work of God. As for <hi>Civil Actions;</hi> his Trading, Ploughing, Working, and Visitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it is not barely to accommodate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with <hi>Worldly Advantages;</hi> that is what <hi>others do;</hi> No, but it is to Glorify God in the station wherein God has placed him.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000623_0013_0FA95ED7CBAE0550"/>
And then, in his <hi>Religious Actions,</hi> a Good man, would have more <hi>Piety</hi> and more <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> than other men. <hi>Others</hi> have some <hi>Faith;</hi> but he would have such an one as <hi>Abraham</hi> had; others have some <hi>Love;</hi> but he would have such an one as <hi>David</hi> had. Others have some <hi>Repentance,</hi> but he would have such an one as <hi>Peter</hi> had. <hi>Others</hi> do something for God; but he would be able to say with <hi>Paul, I have Laboured more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly than they all!</hi> Of Good men, tis said, in Isa. 40.31. <hi>They shall mount up with Wings as</hi> E<hi>agles.</hi> Truly, A Good man is for <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Flights</hi> in Religion; he would fain Soar a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the <hi>middle Region;</hi> Yea, he would, if it might be, come to move with and like the very <hi>Angels</hi> themselves, who you know, are called E<hi>xcellent Spirits.</hi> He hopes he shall one Day come to be, <hi>As the Angels;</hi> and therefore he would now be of such an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Spirit,</hi> that the very <hi>Angels</hi> themselves may take Delight in attending on him. As for that Creeping Frame of some, who would gladly know the <hi>Minimum quod Sic,</hi> or, just how much Religion will set a man within the Gates of Heaven, that they may there make a Stop and Stand; I think, tis Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible to a Godly man.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II. Holiness</hi> is <hi>Excellence;</hi> and that is
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000623_0014_0FA95ED9CE4A1C90"/>
it with which a good man would have a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> most gloriously Replenished. We are told in Psal. 16. 3. <hi>The Saints that are in the Earth, are the</hi> E<hi>xcellent.</hi> The Spirit of a SAINT is an E<hi>xcellent Spirit.</hi> I know not whether he be most of a <hi>Bruit</hi> or a <hi>Devil;</hi> 'tis <hi>one</hi> of them; that shall make a <hi>Scoff</hi> at being a <hi>Saint;</hi> tho' that be a wickedness that has been committed, by some that would be called <hi>Christians.</hi> But a Good Man, is very desirous to be, A <hi>Saint on</hi> E<hi>arth,</hi> &amp; one of the, <hi>Holy Brethren,</hi> Indeed the Inclination of many, is too agreeable to the Popish <hi>Canonization:</hi> which acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges no <hi>Saints,</hi> but what are already in the Heaven of the Blessed. We do but humour <hi>that,</hi> when we do say, <hi>Saint Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> and won't as well say, <hi>Saint Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi> But we do more grosly follow it, when we are for no <hi>Saintship,</hi> till we are dead and gone, and we are, <hi>Like Sheep laid in the Grave.</hi> Whereas, A good man is for being, <hi>A Saint on</hi> E<hi>arth;</hi> inasmuch as he believes, 'tis that, <hi>Without which, No man shall see the Lord.</hi> But <hi>Holiness;</hi> What is that? It is in short, <hi>A Consecration to the Service and Glory of the Great God. God</hi> Holiness is His Advancing of Himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and his Agreeing with none but such as concur with him in doing so. And
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000623_0015_0FA95EDC143AA278"/>
thus <hi>our</hi> Holiness, lies in our Advancing the Honour of God, and making all that we <hi>are,</hi> and all that we <hi>have,</hi> and all that we <hi>do,</hi> subservient thereunto. New a good man, would be such a <hi>Saint,</hi> as thus to have, <hi>Holiness unto the Lord,</hi> written upon all that he is concerned in; he does like those worthy <hi>Macedonians,</hi> of whom we read, <hi>They gave themselves unto the Lord;</hi> and then he subscribes himself, as in <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 38. <hi>Lord, I am thy Servant, Devoted unto thy Fear.</hi> A Spirit of <hi>Respect unto God,</hi> has touched him; and being a Needle touched with such a Loadstone, he would always have none but <hi>God-ward Vergencies</hi> of Soul. A good man, would be an E<hi>noch,</hi> that is to say, <hi>A Dedicated man;</hi> and he would, <hi>Walk with God,</hi> by a Continual <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication</hi> of every thing within his Reach, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Great END of, <hi>Showing forth the Praises of God.</hi> We are Commanded, in I Cor.6. 20. <hi>Glorify God in your Bodies, and in your Spirits, which are His.</hi> The <hi>Spirit</hi> of a Good man says, <hi>Amen</hi> to this! We are Commanded, in I Cor.10.31. <hi>Whether ye Eat, or Drink, or whatever ye do, Do all to the Glory of God.</hi> The <hi>Spirit</hi> of a Good man, cryes out, <hi>Lord, Let me do so!</hi> He is a man that would set a part every thing for <hi>God;</hi> and Subordinate every thing about

him, unto the Interests of the Lord. If the <hi>Flesh</hi> and the <hi>World,</hi> and the <hi>Divel,</hi> tempt him, to do any thing that may be for the Dishonour of God, he would make <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephs</hi> Refusal, <hi>How shall I do this wickedness, and sin against God?</hi> But here is not all; he ha's a <hi>Spirit</hi> for more than this. What <hi>Ahab</hi> so sneakingly and absurdly, said unto <hi>Benhadad,</hi> in I King.20. 4 <hi>I am thine, my Lord, and all that I have; That</hi> would a Good man very Holily speak unto the God that made him; <hi>Let my all be the Lords.</hi> When he looks upon the <hi>Powers</hi> of his <hi>Mind,</hi> he says, <hi>O that this Understanding, this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation, this Conscience, and this Memory, might alwayes be at Work for God;</hi> and, <hi>O that this Will, and these Affections, might alwayes be closing with God my Saviour.</hi> When he Looks upon the <hi>Members</hi> of his <hi>Body,</hi> he says, <hi>O that all my Senses might Operate for God alone; and, O that this Tongue might speak for God, and these Hands Acts for God, and these Feet carry me where God is to be serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Yea, As we read, in Psal.30. Tit. about, <hi>The Dedication of the House of David;</hi> even so, a Good man, would have no <hi>Comfort,</hi> by which Gods <hi>Glory</hi> should not be promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. His <hi>House,</hi> His <hi>Cash,</hi> His Lands, His Goods, His Friends, and all His Capacities, he Wishes, <hi>O that my God might have the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000623_0017_0FA95EDD157B5FD8"/>
more Acknowledgments for my having such things as these!</hi> And therefore also, he sometimes does ask himself, like <hi>David</hi> of old: he does more particularly ask himself, <hi>O what is there that I may do for the Dear Name of my God?</hi> This note is the <hi>Spirit of Holiness</hi> in a good man; and whatever O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion the Debauched and Vitiated Souls of unrenewed <hi>Sinners,</hi> may have concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, if all the <hi>Angels</hi> that are now Invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly present here, had it referred unto them, I am sure they would all say, <hi>This is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Spirit!</hi>

               <hi>III.</hi> A good man would be of an <hi>Active</hi> and an <hi>Useful</hi> Spirit, and that is an <hi>Excellent</hi> One. What we render, <hi>Excellent</hi> here, may be rendred <hi>Precious.</hi> A good man would be such a <hi>Jewel</hi> to his Neighbours, as that they should all fare the better for him; he would give them cause to say concerning him, while he lives, <hi>He is a precious man;</hi> and when he Dyes, <hi>There's one gone that will he miss'd!</hi> It was said concerning one that was an Active and an Useful Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the good of His People, in 2 <hi>Sam</hi> 18. 3. <hi>Thou art worth ten thousand of us.</hi> Why, a good man would make himself of <hi>much Use</hi> to as many Thousands of his Neighbours, as he can; and if this will
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000623_0018_0FA95EDDE7189B20"/>
make him of <hi>More Worth</hi> than many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of them, he will be so. It is noted of a <hi>Sheep,</hi> that every thing about it, is of some good use or other. A good man is a <hi>Sheep</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ, the <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pherd of Israel;</hi> and he would have some good <hi>Use</hi> made of whatever God has given him. Indeed, this is the proper Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Character of a <hi>Good Man,</hi> as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 7. oppos'd unto a <hi>Righteous</hi> one; 'tis a Man, who, <hi>Does Good.</hi> A good man will be an Excellent Husband and Steward of the <hi>Talents,</hi> which God has bestow'd upon him; and put 'em all to an <hi>Excellent Use.</hi> He would fain be, as it was noted of the Blessed <hi>Bradford;</hi> E<hi>ither with Tongue, or Pen, or Purse, always doing of Good.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he seldome comes into any Company but he thinks with himself, <hi>What useful thing shall I Say or Do, before we part?</hi> There are several <hi>Relations,</hi> which the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven has placed him in; and he would so discharge those <hi>Relations,</hi> that all about him should Bless God for ever for him; he would procure <hi>those Praises</hi> to make Heaven ring every day on his behalf, <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be God for such a Magistrate, for such a Minister, for such a Father, such a Master, such an Husband, or such a Son!</hi> All his <hi>Gifts,</hi> and all his <hi>Graces,</hi> and all his <hi>Capacities</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:000623_0019_0FA95EE05FF5F9F0"/>
he would so lay out, that the Church of God, may have the Advantage of them. And, if you can but evidently lay before him, <hi>An opportunity to be Serviceable,</hi> you need not use many Motives to make him take it: no, thinks he, <hi>My Opportunities are my Treasures!</hi> His <hi>Riches,</hi> if God have sent him any, how does he Employ a good por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them? It was said, <hi>If Riches In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, set not your Hearts upon them;</hi> instead of <hi>That,</hi> he <hi>sets his Heart</hi> upon Contriving what <hi>Good</hi> he shall do with what he has? 'Tis said in <hi>Isa.</hi> 32. 8. <hi>He does Devise Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Things.</hi> He sets himself to <hi>Devise</hi> how he may support sacred and civil Order, how he may set the poor to work, how he may feed the Hungry, clothe the Naked, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Sick, Comfort and Requite his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and make the Heart of the Aged, the Widow, and the Orphan, Sing for Joy. And hence also, He is a man of a <hi>Publick</hi> S<hi>pirit.</hi> He is not all for <hi>Himself,</hi> but he earns that Epitaph to be inscrib'd upon his Grave at last, <hi>Here lies a Good Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Wealths Man!</hi> and while he lives he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for the whole <hi>Vessel,</hi> as well as his own <hi>Cabin;</hi> especially when an Horrible Storm does Threaten all. When that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> the Ancestor of our present Soveraign, had from
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:000623_0020_0FA95EE332F1BF80"/>
a Treacherous and Murderous Papist re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived such a mortal wound, that he saw he had but one Breath to draw in the World, he cry'd out, <hi>O my God, have mercy on my Soul, and on my poor people!</hi> His <hi>poor People!</hi> had half of his last Breath. Truly, so, a Good Man would let his <hi>poor People,</hi> have more than <hi>Half</hi> of all that he has, when it <hi>must</hi> and <hi>can</hi> be afforded unto them. Be sure, he will not grumble at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very penny that goes to defray, the <hi>Publick Charges,</hi> while he can throw away whole Pounds on his own <hi>private Pleasures.</hi> Nor will he needlesly and angrily Decline to Serve the <hi>Publick,</hi> when he has a clear Call unto it. Tho' a sense of <hi>Inability</hi> may make him very backward in accepting of an <hi>Office;</hi> yet if he be <hi>Able</hi> he will be <hi>Willing</hi> to do his best. It is true, every <hi>Publick Servant</hi> must carry two <hi>Handkerchiefs</hi> about him, one to wipe off <hi>Sweat,</hi> of Travail, another to wipe off the <hi>Spit</hi> of Reproach, but a Good Man, has his <hi>Handkerchief</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at hand. It is possible, that the <hi>Poor People,</hi> have been shamefully <hi>Ungrateful</hi> to him, for what he has already done; but their being <hi>Ungrateful</hi> shall not make him <hi>Unuseful;</hi> he Looks for his Rewards, not in the <hi>Acclamations</hi> of a fickle and froward people, but in the Great Gods, <hi>Well done
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000623_0021_0FA95EE42D6D74A0"/>
Good and Faithful Servant!</hi> he can pass by their Little Follies, and still spend his Time and Strength, and Estate for them; even, <hi>To do them good against their Wills;</hi> as every one must, that will do them <hi>good</hi> at all. In <hi>Serviceableness,</hi> He is, <hi>Like the Lion, which turneth not away for any.</hi> It is required in Gal.6. 10. <hi>As we have opportunity, let us do Good unto all men.</hi> And that which the Good Man says upon it, is, <hi>Lord, give me opportunities, and an heart with my opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>IV.</hi> A Good Man would have an <hi>Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Breath,</hi> and that is both a symptom and an Instance of an <hi>Excellent Spirit.</hi> By <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> here, <hi>Breath</hi> may be one thing intended; as 'tis in some other places. Now a man, of an <hi>Excellent Breath,</hi> imports much as a man of an E<hi>xcellent Speech.</hi> And therefore 'tis added in our Context here, H<hi>e that hath Knowledge, spareth his words.</hi> We read in <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.7. concerning, E<hi>xcellent</hi> S<hi>peech.</hi> Why, such would a good man, have his own S<hi>peech</hi> to be. He says, with the Wise Man, <hi>I will speak of</hi> E<hi>xcellent Things;</hi> and it is in <hi>excellent strains,</hi> too, that he would speak. It is an observable Antithesis, in <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 20. <hi>The Tongue of the Just is as choice silver; but the heart of the wicked is little worth.</hi> Thus, here; inasmuch as a
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000623_0022_0FA95EE4902A13A8"/>
good man has an E<hi>xcellent</hi> S<hi>pirit,</hi> or an <hi>heart of some worth within him,</hi> the Tongue or Speech of such a man, will deserve a <hi>price,</hi> beyond that of the finest <hi>silver,</hi> to be set upon it; yea, the Name of <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> or, a <hi>Golden Mouth'd</hi> Person, belongs unto him. A good man would speak <hi>Honestly,</hi> whenever he speaks. It may be said of him, <hi>He puts away Lying, and</hi> S<hi>peaketh the TRUTH with his NEIGHBOUR.</hi> He is for a perfect Harmony both between <hi>Words and Things</hi> and between T<hi>houghts</hi> and <hi>Words.</hi> Perhaps he do's not speak <hi>all</hi> he Thinks, yet he would ever speak <hi>as</hi> he Thinks. A Good Man would speak <hi>Usefully</hi> too, when ever he speaks. It may be said of him, <hi>No rotten communication proceeds out of his mouth, but such as is good for the use of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difying.</hi> He is not for such discourse, as may infect the manners of the Hearers; but he is for discoursing, partly on matters of <hi>Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Business,</hi> and partly on subjects of <hi>General Concernment;</hi> as on the <hi>Truths</hi> of God; or on his <hi>Works,</hi> both in <hi>Creation</hi> and in <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi> Once more, A Good Man would also speak <hi>Solidly,</hi> when ever he speaks. He will not foam out his own <hi>Wrath;</hi> nor fly out like a <hi>Nabal,</hi> with reviling language; nor, if they vex him, will he bawl, and fume, like <hi>Saul,</hi> who in his fury, would call
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000623_0023_0FA95EE64583BE40"/>
his own Son, <hi>The Son of a Whore.</hi> Hee will not sound out his own <hi>Praise</hi> neither; nor will he bragg of what has Enriched him, or Enobled him; no if he must mention any thing that might set off himself, He covers it with such a style as <hi>John</hi> used of old, <hi>There was a Certain Disciple.</hi> Much less will he utter any <hi>Filthiness</hi> whatsoever. All Baw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Obscene talk, is Banished from his lips; nor will he let the Loathesome Steam and Stench of an <hi>Open Sepulchre</hi> come thro' his Throat, by his descanting upon those things, whereof the Apostle saies, <hi>Tis a shame to speak of them.</hi> Finally, A Good Man would speak <hi>Deliberately,</hi> when ever he speaks. He would neither speak <hi>Too soon;</hi> because words can't bee E<hi>aten.</hi> And he considers, <hi>The heart of the Righteous studies to answer; But the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things.</hi> Nor would he speak <hi>Too much;</hi> because when the Chest is always o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, tis taken for granted, there is little that's valuable there. And he considers, <hi>In the multitude of words, there wants not sin.</hi> What shall I say more; A Good Man would speak so, as becomes one that remembred, what the Scripture saies, <hi>The Lord hearkened and heard!</hi> It is reported by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that the Feasts among the Faithful in the <hi>P</hi>rimitive Times, were seasoned with very Savoury
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000623_0024_0FA95EE6F12D5330"/>
Communications; and he gives this as the cause of it; <hi>Ita fabulantur, ut qui sciant Dominum andire.</hi> Thus let a good man be where he will; suppose at the table, yea, or in the <hi>Tavern,</hi> he would speak, what he would be willing to find in the <hi>Book of Gods Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branee.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>V.</hi> If a man could get his <hi>Natural Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi> to be S<hi>anctify'd,</hi> there would be an E<hi>xcellent</hi> S<hi>pirit</hi> in him; and this is an Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness which a good man would be very ambitious of. It was the Blessing, in I Thes. 5. 23. <hi>May your whole spirit and soul and body, be preserved Blameless.</hi> There are who judge, that by S<hi>pirit,</hi> here, is meant our <hi>Humour</hi> or our <hi>Temper,</hi> which is that <hi>Air</hi> of our Complexion that results from some circumstances of the <hi>Union</hi> between our S<hi>oul,</hi> and our <hi>Body.</hi> If a man be of a Generous, Affable, Candid <hi>Humour,</hi> we say, <hi>He is a man of such a</hi> S<hi>pirit;</hi> and it were indeed that E<hi>xcellent</hi> S<hi>pirit,</hi> which a good man would fain work himself unto. Every man, is born with some S<hi>pirit,</hi> which we call the <hi>Genius</hi> of the man; and a good man would gladly have his <hi>Humour,</hi> his <hi>Temper,</hi> his <hi>Genius,</hi> cured of all that may be distastful in it. He would therefore <hi>Learn,</hi> what his own <hi>humour</hi> is, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is not very commonly or <hi>easily
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:000623_0025_0FA95EE79EE0A5D8"/>
Learn't.</hi> We shall not be many <hi>Weeks,</hi> with scarce any man alive, but we shall give a shrow'd guess, <hi>What humour be is of?</hi> Whereas we are many <hi>Years</hi> before we take an exact view of our own. But I say, A good man, would be throughly acquainted with his own <hi>humour;</hi> and then, he would both <hi>Limit</hi> it, and <hi>Apply</hi> it so, as that it may serve him like S<hi>ails</hi> to a Ship, or like <hi>Wings</hi> to a Bird, in the Glorifying of God. One good man, is like <hi>Abraham,</hi> of a free, noble, spending H<hi>umour.</hi> He would now take advantage from this, to supply and nourish the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tressed Members of the Lord Jesus. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good man, is like S<hi>ampson,</hi> of a merry, chearful, pleasant <hi>Humour.</hi> From this would he take advantage to be much in Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings unto God, and in the Joy of the Lord. Here you shall see a good man like E<hi>lijah,</hi> of a Cholerick <hi>Humour.</hi> Now from thence he would take occasion to tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify against the Sins of the place, with more warmth and zeal, than is in other men. There you shall see a good man, like <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> of a Melancholly <hi>Humour.</hi> Now he'l turn this, into the channel of Mourning over his own Sins, and the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of his Neighbours. A good man is sometimes like <hi>Peter,</hi> of a Forward <hi>Humour.</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:000623_0026_0FA95EE86190A6C0"/>
From hence he'l be ready to undertake any Testimony that must be born for the truths and ways of God. Sometimes a Good Man is like <hi>John,</hi> of a very loving <hi>Humour.</hi> Then hee'l set himself to Enkindle Charity, and Extinguish all Contention, in those that are about him. One while, a Good Man, is like <hi>Moses,</hi> of a more Composed <hi>Humour.</hi> And then he will keep up an even walk with God, Let the winds blow from what Point of the Compass they will upon him. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiles, a Good Man is like <hi>Heman,</hi> of a Suspicious <hi>Humour.</hi> And then he will ever suspect lest a Lying Divel, or a False-Heart, be putting some Cheat upon him. Perhaps the Good Man is like <hi>David,</hi> of a Courage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Humour.</hi> He will then be, <hi>Valiant for the Truth upon Earth.</hi> Or perhaps he is like <hi>Barak,</hi> of a Cowardly <hi>Humour.</hi> He will then by <hi>Fear of Death</hi> be driven to the utmost preparation for it. I was going to touch upon a <hi>Revengeful</hi> Humour, and a <hi>Penurious</hi> Humour; but, I may inform the people of such Humours, that I can't re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member any Good Man in all the Bible, of them. So that I only add,—A Good Man would reduce his Humour to, <hi>The law of Christ,</hi> and then hee'l be of an <hi>Excellent Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> A Man will be most <hi>Excellent</hi> that way that his own <hi>Spirit,</hi> or <hi>Humour</hi> goes.</p>

               <hi>VI.</hi> An Intimate <hi>communion</hi> with the <hi>unseen &amp; future world,</hi> would make an <hi>excellent-spirit,</hi> and a good man would pursue that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. It was confess'd concerning <hi>Daniel</hi> in <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.12. <hi>An</hi> E<hi>xcellent</hi> S<hi>pirit was found in him.</hi> And, I pray, what was the Spirit of a <hi>Daniel?</hi> why, it was a Spirit so <hi>Refined</hi> by <hi>Mortification</hi> of all Sensual inclinations, and by assiduous, <hi>Meditations</hi> on Scripture, and <hi>Supplications</hi> to Heaven, that the <hi>Spiritual World</hi> became very familiar with him. I say then, A Good Man would have his own <hi>Spirit</hi> wound up unto an <hi>Unison,</hi> with that part of the <hi>Spiritual World,</hi> which now dwells in God. There is a blessed <hi>World of Spirits</hi> at this day, in the Celestial Regions; but a Good Man thinks with himself. <hi>O! what are they now a doing in the Spiritual World! How are they Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, How are they Employ'd, in that Excellent World!</hi> And as far as this present, Sinful, Dying State will allow of it, he accordingly conforms himself thereunto. He therefore would be most exquisitely Purify'd from the Feculencies of <hi>Pride, Malice, Envy, Selfishness, Uncleanness,</hi> and all that may be offensive to the Holy Spirit of God; and He comes hence to be of so fine a S<hi>pirit,</hi> that he ha's now &amp; then those <hi>Touches</hi> upon him, whereof I may say,<hi>They are unutterable things;</hi> &amp; a Stranger cannot intermeddle in them. Such an <hi>exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>

Spirit, is an E<hi>xcellent</hi> Spirit. But there was one thing in the Spirit of <hi>Daniel,</hi> which calls for a little further Illustration with us. An Angel said unto him, in Dan.9 23. <hi>Thou art greatly Beloved.</hi> It seems, the Angel counted him one of an E<hi>xcellent Spirit.</hi> But it may be rendred, <hi>Thou art a man of Desires;</hi> which a very great Interpreter, says, 'tis to be taken <hi>Actively.</hi> He was a man that had many D<hi>esires</hi> in his Holy Soul, after the <hi>Messiah,</hi> after the <hi>Coming</hi> of the Messiah, and after the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of his Coming. He consulted the Sacred <hi>Prophecies</hi> very much, with <hi>Desires</hi> to understand wherea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts the <hi>Church</hi> of God was in the <hi>Line</hi> of Time; and by much <hi>Prayer</hi> with <hi>Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> he prepared himself accordingly. Here was a thing that rendred him, <hi>A man of Desires,</hi> among the very Angels of God. Thus, if a man would soberly <hi>Bend</hi> himself (which the Apostle tells us, the very <hi>Angels</hi> themselves <hi>Desire</hi> to do!) to <hi>Look</hi> into the <hi>Characters</hi> and <hi>Approaches</hi> of the Coming of our Lord; and instead of any Unscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and Ill Computed Conclusions about the precise <hi>Time</hi> of it, if the man would now vigorously prosecute such <hi>Frames</hi> and such <hi>Works,</hi> as we should wish our Lord at His Coming would find us in; it would make the man to be of an <hi>Excellent Spirit.</hi>

There is a wonderful <hi>Charm,</hi> in modest, humble, well-regulated Studies upon the K<hi>ingdom</hi> of our Lord, which is to <hi>Come,</hi> When <hi>His Will shall be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven;</hi> they give a man a certain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libation of the <hi>Glory</hi> that shall be in that Kingdom; and they <hi>Transfigure</hi> him till he become, <hi>An Excellent Man.</hi> A little before the <hi>First</hi> Coming of our Lord, there were some that like <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Anna,</hi> had cast up <hi>Daniels</hi> weeks, and finding that they could not be far from the Time of our Lords Coming, they were daily fitting themselves for the Appearance of the <hi>Consolation of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> Now these were the <hi>Excellent Spirits</hi> of those Dayes; and the like Dispositions now, towards the <hi>Second</hi> Coming of our Lord, would render men the E<hi>xcellent</hi> Ones of ours. When <hi>Ezekiel</hi> had in a Vision once accurately Look'd upon, <hi>The Son of Man,</hi> from that very Time, the Name of, <hi>Son of</hi> M<hi>an,</hi> came to be put upon himself. This I say, Let us be duly concerned about the Coming of the <hi>Son of Man,</hi> and that <hi>Son of Man,</hi> will gloriously impart unto us, of His own <hi>Excellent Spirit.</hi>

               <hi>VII.</hi> The man who Reckons his own <hi>Soul,</hi> an <hi>Excellent Being,</hi> is like to have an <hi>Excellent Spirit;</hi> and a Good Man, will
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:000623_0030_0FA95EEF1A857590"/>
make such a Reckoning. Of a wicked man, 'tis said in Prov. 15. 32. <hi>He despises his own Soul.</hi> But a good man, altho' he do with much <hi>Abasement</hi> of <hi>Soul,</hi> bewayl that <hi>Abasement</hi> of <hi>Soul,</hi> which by Sin, is come upon him; yet he counts his own Soul to be a most <hi>Excellent Being.</hi> When he weighs the State of his Never-dying Soul, it weighs down the whole world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, in his Resentments of it. A Great King was once advised every day, to think on that Word of the Lord Jesus, in Matth. 16. 26. <hi>What is a man profited, if he Gain the whole World, and Loose his own Soul? or, what shall be give in</hi> E<hi>xchange for his Soul?</hi> Why, a good man has that word ever now and then sounding in his Ears, <hi>Ten worlds are not so much worth, as that Soul of thine!</hi> Those two words, A CHRIST and, A SOUL, make a mighty Noise in the Ears of such a man. He looks upon his own Soul, and then he thinks, <hi>This poor Soul, or, such a Soul as this, the whole inferiour World, cannot show an Abler or Nobler Thing?</hi> He again looks upon his own Soul, and thinks. <hi>The Almighty Son of God Himself, counted not his own Blood, a price too big, to lay down for the Ransome of such a Soul?</hi> He looks once more upon his own Soul, and thinks, <hi>The best Angel in Heaven, would gladly be a Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:000623_0031_0FA95EEFD97F2538"/>
to assist the Deliverances of such a Soul!</hi> He goes on to look upon his own Soul, &amp; think, <hi>Here is a Soul, as poor as it is, every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Heaven would ring with Joy, at the Conversion of such a Soul. It is a Soul made for Eternity; the bright Mansions of heaven, were built on purpose, for such a Soul to be for ever in them.</hi> And when a good man thus thinks on the <hi>Excellency</hi> of his own Soul, oh! how loth is he to sell that <hi>Soul,</hi> for a <hi>Song! I</hi>ndeed, ungodly men do make most woful <hi>Bargains</hi> about their Souls; insomuch that their Souls may complain, as did the Saviour of Souls, in Zech. 11. 13. <hi>A goodly Price was I valued at of them!</hi> If the Devil tender them a little bit of Money, or Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, they'l sell their <hi>Souls</hi> unto him, by <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions like the Sin of Witchcraft.</hi> Whereas, if the Devil offer unto a good man, all the <hi>Pleasures</hi> and <hi>Profits</hi> and <hi>Honours</hi> of the World, he will not sin for the sake thereof, and <hi>wrong his own Soul.</hi> No, he says to the Devil, <hi>Thy offers perish with thee; my Soul is too excellent a thing for thee to have it so.</hi> But instead hereof, a good man thinks no pains, no prayers, no cares too much for the <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> of his own Soul. Indeed <hi>Judas</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grutch'd what was Religiously Expended; saying in Mat.26.8. <hi>To what purpose is this wast?</hi> But when a good man reflects upon all the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:000623_0032_0FA95EF08DB2CA48"/>
               <hi>Self-denial,</hi> and all the <hi>Diligence,</hi> and all the Exercises of <hi>Piery</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> which are for the health of a Soul; he do's not say, <hi>To what purpose is this wast?</hi> No, he owns, <hi>An Excellent Soul, is worth all that can be done for it.</hi>

            <p n="8">VIII. There is a reading of my Text, which is to this purpose, <hi>A man of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing is of a Cool Spirit;</hi> and indeed a <hi>Cool Spirit,</hi> is an <hi>Excellent Spirit.</hi> So then, a Good Man would have a <hi>Spirit</hi> free from those <hi>Heats,</hi> which may distemper it. Particularly, A Good Man would have a <hi>Cool Spirit</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Afflictions</hi> from the hand of God. He would have no Rage of <hi>Spirit,</hi> at any of those Losses, or Crosses, which may befall him; No, there are these two things, which he takes always for Granted. One is that in I Sam. 3 18. <hi>It is the Lord.</hi> Another is that in Gen. 50 20. <hi>God meant it unto Good.</hi> This makes him resolve, <hi>Il take anything well at the hands of my God!</hi> He would with a marvellous <hi>Patience,</hi> of Spirit, bear any of those disasters, that may come upon him, as being perswaded, <hi>That God therein punishes him, far less than his iniquities have deserved;</hi> and <hi>That God chastens him for his profit.</hi> Moreover, A Good Man, would have a <hi>Cool Spirit</hi> under <hi>Injuries</hi> from the hand of Man also.

               <hi>Spirit,</hi> altho' he should be never so much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted and abused; and he would be ready to overlook the most provoking passages. He would follow that pattern, in <hi>I Pet.</hi> 2.21. <hi>Christ, who when he was Reviled, Reviled not again, when He suffered, He Threatned not.</hi> He would obey that precept in <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 17, 19. <hi>Recompence no man evil for evil; Avenge not your selves, but rather give place to wrath.</hi> He would have such a <hi>Spirit</hi> as there was in <hi>Moses; Moses</hi> was Pastor and Leader of a great congregation, wherein some or other were almost every day basely murmuring at him; yet was he always <hi>Preaching</hi> to them, <hi>Praying</hi> for them, and Standing in their <hi>Gap;</hi> with small or no Regret at their unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness. He would have such a <hi>Spirit,</hi> as there was in <hi>Calvin; Calvin</hi> had bin by <hi>Luther</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handsomely Reflected on; But, <hi>Well,</hi> said this Brave man, <hi>Though</hi> Luther <hi>should call me a Devil, yet I will call him an Eminent Servant of the Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> What a Spirit was that Expressed by Famous Mr. <hi>Dod?</hi> A furious Blade being Enraged at his faithful Ministry, barbarously gave him a Blow, that struck Two of his Teeth out. He spat out his Teeth with his Blood, into his Hand; and only said, <hi>Here, you have knock'd out a Couple of my Teeth without any cause; but on condition I might help forward
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:000623_0034_0FA95EF32A06AAC0"/>
the Salvation of your Soul, I would permit you to dash out all the rest.</hi> A Good man would gladly be of such a Spirit; and have that, <hi>Meek and Quiet Spirit,</hi> whereof the Apostle tells us, <hi>In the sight of God, it is of great price.</hi> Be sure, The <hi>Spirit</hi> that is <hi>Contentious,</hi> is not <hi>Excellent,</hi> albeit, <hi>only by Pride</hi> (which is an affectation of <hi>Excellence) comes Contention. Fire</hi> will soonest Catch in the roofs of Thatch't, Low-built, Little Cottages. The Highest Regions are sedate; there are no storms to ruffle them. <hi>Excellent Spirits,</hi> like the Angels, are willing to go <hi>Down</hi> as well as <hi>Up,</hi> the Ladder of Heaven; and they will not Justle one another. This is an <hi>Excellent Spirit;</hi> I appeal to every <hi>Conscience,</hi> whether it be not so. But, in Gods Name, can you stand before the <hi>Glass?</hi> who of us can find such a <hi>Spirit</hi> in our selves? I have only this further to say upon it. As they said, in Judg.18 9. <hi>Arise, for we have seen the Land; behold, it is very Good; and are ye still? Be not slothful to go and Inter and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess the Land.</hi> So <hi>I</hi> say, Arise, you have seen the Linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a <hi>Spirit;</hi> behold, it is an <hi>Excellent Spirit;</hi> and are ye still? <hi>Be not slothful;</hi> but use all sit means for the obtaining of such a Spirit. If you ask, <hi>What shall are do?</hi> I only Leave this one Lesson with you. <hi>Cry mightily for the Spirit of God.</hi> It was said of <hi>Barnabas</hi> He was <hi>ful of the Holy Ghost;</hi> and it is further noted, He was a <hi>good man;</hi> or one of <hi>an excellent Spirit.</hi> O <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>In our Context, We find that the People of God, had been Labouring under <hi>Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> and <hi>Confusions,</hi> which rendred them very miserable; they had cast off the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and for this they were punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a <hi>Slavery</hi> to <hi>men;</hi> a Cruel <hi>Shishak</hi> had got them under the Yokes of his Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Government. The merciful God was pleased, at length, to <hi>Recover</hi> them out of the miseries with which they had been harassed; and <hi>Establish</hi> them with Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments not altogether unlike those which they had formerly enjoy'd; in which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Restoration, that Eminent Man of God, the Prophet <hi>Shemajah,</hi> was more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily Instrumental.</p>

My Text in general Terms, does give us an Account of the Circumstances which attended the Restoration of the Jews out of their Calamities. There was first, a Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Humiliation,</hi> on mans part; there was then a Gracious, <hi>Reconciliation</hi> on Gods part; and upon this it follows, <hi>Things went well;</hi> or as it may be rendred, <hi>There were good Things among them.</hi> As there were the <hi>Good Things,</hi> which produced <hi>Good Terms</hi> between God and Them; the <hi>Good Things</hi> of Repentance, of Obedience, of Reformation; so there were the <hi>Good Things</hi> which were the effects of such <hi>Good Terms</hi> as those; namely, the <hi>Good Things,</hi> of Prosperity. <hi>Good Times</hi> are imply'd in the <hi>Good Things,</hi> that were now among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God. <hi>Things went well;</hi> the meaning is, They had not Needy, Hungry, Bloody, <hi>Strangers</hi> any more to Lord it over them; There were no <hi>Shishaks</hi> to squeez hard Quitrents from them for what they had before possess'd as their <hi>Free-holds</hi> Time out of mind; As to their <hi>Sacred</hi> Concerns, there was none to give them Disturbance in the <hi>Worship</hi> of God; As to their <hi>Civil</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, there was now no <hi>Law,</hi> and no <hi>Tax,</hi> imposed upon them, except what their own Acts concurr'd unto. <hi>Things went well,</hi> when the <hi>Times</hi> grew both <hi>Morally,</hi> and <hi>Peaceably</hi> Better than they were before.</p>

The Text thus paraphrased, will cast into our Hands, a very important CASE; <hi>When do Things Go Well among a People?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or, What are those <hi>Good Things,</hi> which would make <hi>Any,</hi> and, if you please, OUR SELVES, Particularly, an Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py People?</p>
            <p>In the Handling of this Case, there is,</p>
            <p>FIRST, One General Assertion, which we may advance, as Preliminary to our more Particular Thoughts, that are to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. 'Tis This;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Good Men</hi> are <hi>Good Things</hi> among any People; and Things will <hi>go well</hi> with a People, when <hi>Good Men</hi> abound among them. <hi>Good Men</hi> have much of God with them; 'tis to <hi>Them,</hi> that the God of Heaven says, <hi>I am with thee;</hi> so that if we have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such <hi>Men of God</hi> among us, the <hi>God of those men,</hi> will therein vouchsafe His own Presence unto us; now, the presence of God carryes all sorts of Blessings with it. He says, <hi>Wo to them, if I depart from them;</hi> and we may say, <hi>It will be well with us, if God be with us;</hi> now, God our <hi>Father,</hi> will be where many of His <hi>Children</hi> are. It was said concerning a Sinful Nation, in Isai.6.13.

               <hi>The Holy seed, shall be the substance thereof;</hi> that is, the S<hi>tock</hi> or T<hi>runk</hi> of it. As the strength of a tree, is in the stock or trunk of it; so the <hi>strength</hi> of a people do's ly in a Number of <hi>Holy</hi> men among them; <hi>Holy Men,</hi> that have wholly Dedicated themselves unto the Service and Glory of God: <hi>Holy men</hi> that are afraid of defiling themselves with any Breaches of piety, or charity in their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation: <hi>Holy men,</hi> to whom the character of <hi>Barnabas</hi> belongs, T<hi>hey are good men and full of faith and full of the Holy Ghost;</hi> of such men I may say, T<hi>hey are the chariots of a people,</hi> &amp; <hi>the Horsemen thereof,</hi> we should be well-guarded, if there were good store of such good men among us. <hi>Good men</hi> are <hi>Gap-men,</hi> to keep off the Judgments of Heaven, from the people, which they belong unto. It is recorded of a good <hi>Moses,</hi> in <hi>Psal.</hi> 106. 23. <hi>He stood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, in the Breach, to turn away His wrath, Lest he should destroy them.

It was a marvellous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, which the Lord used unto <hi>Lot,</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 22. <hi>I cannot do any thing against So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, till thou be come to</hi> Zoar. Blessed Lord, Can one <hi>Righteous Man,</hi> thus ward off the Blows of thy Vengeance, from a sinful Neighbourhood! yea, so it is. Good men

occasion all Things to <hi>Go well</hi> in the places where they Live; and they do it, <hi>partly</hi> by stopping and checking the current of wickedness, which would else lay all open to the Indignation of God: <hi>partly</hi> by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating of what is vertuous, and laudable, among those that are about them; but <hi>chiefly</hi> by their fervent <hi>Prayers,</hi> whereby they Interceed with God for their poor Neighbours, and say, <hi>I will not let thee go, except thou bless them.</hi> The Prayers of men that are the Friends of God, yea, the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of one such man, are, as the Queen of the <hi>Scots</hi> once acknowledged, <hi>Of more Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count than an Army Ten Thousand Strong.</hi> 'Tis the Prayer of such men, whereof we are told in Jam. 5. 16. <hi>It availeth much.</hi> 'Twas the Prayer of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Health unto them, with whom he So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed; and the Prayer of <hi>Samuel,</hi> that often saved <hi>Israel</hi> from Desolation. There was a Legion of <hi>Good Men,</hi> once in the old Roman Army; and that Legion did by their prayers obtain such a Deliverance for the Army, as was the Admiration of the World. <hi>Good Men</hi> are the Favourites of the Great God; He says of them, <hi>They are my Jewels:</hi> May our Country become a Cabinet full of those <hi>Jewels,</hi> and our God will see, that it shall never be lost.

fine, The Rewards of Universal Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, will cause all things to <hi>Go-well,</hi> where that Goodness does prevail. I say then, Let good men be much Countenanced, and Encouraged; and let a favourable Respect be still cast upon, <hi>The Faithful in the Land.</hi> Where good men, find Ill entertainment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a people, that people do, but, if I may speak all in one word, <hi>cut down the bough they stand upon.</hi> On the other side, it was a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Account of a good man, which a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier once gave to a great King, <hi>Sir, you have not a better Subject in your Kingdome than that man; pray, make much of him; for that man can have what he will, of God Almighty.</hi> But O that <hi>All</hi> men, would become <hi>good</hi> men, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this perswasive thereunto.

I say, unto all the Unregenerate Sinners in the midst of us; <hi>You that Live without the Fear of God in you; 'tis you that are the</hi> Achans, <hi>the</hi> Troublers, <hi>of the Land.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as all of you that seriously Turn to God, albeit you may be never so <hi>Useless</hi> and <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> otherwise; even you, that are of the Sex, which can do no more <hi>Pray</hi> before God; it is <hi>You,</hi> that will cause Things to <hi>Go well</hi> among us. <hi>Good Hearts</hi> will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure <hi>Good Times.</hi> It is the Speech of the Wise Man, in Eccl. 7. 10. <hi>Say not thou, what is the cause, that the former Dayes were better than these?

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> some other particular Assertions, which we are now to descend unto.

            <p>To speak yet more particularly.</p>
            <p>First.

Even so, I say; Tis a <hi>Blessed Land,</hi> whose Magistrates are Men that have Renounced the Flesh, the World, and the Divel; and entirely consecrated themselves to God in Christ, according to his Eternal Covenant.
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:000623_0047_0FA95EFF67A2C250"/>
               <hi>Blessed</hi> is the <hi>Land,</hi> whose Magistrates, have hearts that prefer the Interest of God, above all secular Considerations whatsoever. <hi>Blessed</hi> is the <hi>Land,</hi> whose Magistrates keep up a Constant Communion with God, in all the methods of Devotion every Day: &amp; can heartily speak those memorable words of that Noble Italian Marquess, <hi>That mans mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney may, for all me, perish with him, who counts all the riches of the Indies, worth one Dayes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God.</hi> Magistrates will make a <hi>Blessed Land</hi> when they do, as it was repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of a great Emperour, <hi>Soepius cum Deo, quam cum Hominibus loqui,</hi> converse more with <hi>God</hi> than <hi>Men.</hi> It is for this cause that <hi>New-England</hi> has been a <hi>Bliss-Land</hi> hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto; and may it still continue so!

            <p>When a man sins in his <hi>Political Capacity,</hi> let Political Societies animadvert upon him; but when he sins only in a <hi>Religious Capacity,</hi> Societies more purely Religious, are the fittest then to deal with him.

the good knowledge of the Lord.</hi> Moreover, it belongs unto <hi>Magistrates</hi> to punish all the vices which disturb the good order and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of <hi>Humane</hi> S<hi>ociety;</hi> And hence also <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conscience</hi> is not to be permitted as a cloak for <hi>Liberty of Profaneness.</hi> To live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Worship of God, or to Blaspheme and Revile his Blessed Name, is to be chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as abominably Criminal; for there can be no pretence <hi>of Conscience</hi> thereunto. Things will <hi>go well</hi> when they <hi>go thus;</hi> they <hi>go well</hi> when there is an accomplishment of that word, in Rom. 13. 3. <hi>Rulers are not a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to Good works, but unto the evil.</hi> Tis well known, That the Laws of <hi>England</hi> inflict Suitable penalties on such Vices, as <hi>Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ess,</hi> and <hi>Idleness,</hi> and the like; and yet no <hi>Liberty of Conscience</hi> is invaded in those whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Laws. If a man have been Drunk, for the first offence, he is to be fined nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; for the next offence, he is bound with two sureties for the good Behaviour. And if an <hi>Ale-House-keeper</hi> be Convicted of Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eness, he is disabled for three years to keep an <hi>Ale-House;</hi> and if the <hi>Keepers</hi> of such Houses do suffer any of the Parish to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue unseasonably <hi>Tipling</hi> in their Houses, there are yet sharper augmentations of the penalties. Thus for profane <hi>Cursing</hi> and <hi>Swearing,</hi> there is a mulct also by law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.

               <hi>SECONDLY,</hi> It is to be said, That <hi>Good Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi> are also some of the <hi>Best Things</hi> among any people; and Things will <hi>Go well</hi> with a people when they have <hi>Good Pastors</hi> over them.

where they are; as <hi>Ezra</hi> tarried by the River <hi>Ahava,</hi> Ezra 8. 15. till he had got, <hi>some Levites to go</hi> with him, that they might go and make a comfortable work of it; you have seen, says he, Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons very suddenly unsettled by the God of Heaven for the want of this.</q> Even so, I say; If we would not have a direful Blast of Heaven upon all our Concerns, let it be made an <hi>

                  </gap>rable thing,</hi> for any Plantations to remain long, without such as may dispense the Ordinances of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.

When Things were to <hi>go well</hi> with <hi>Israel,</hi> the God of <hi>Israel</hi> thus expressed it, in Jer. 3. 15. <hi>I will give you Pastors, according to mine Heart, which shall

            <p>Tis <hi>well</hi> when Ministers are men <hi>Zealous</hi> for God &amp; Christ, &amp; the Souls of Men. <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> that maintain a most exact &amp; watchful <hi>Walk with God</hi> continually; <hi>Ministers</hi> Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally acquainted with the power of their Doctrine upon their <hi>own Hearts;</hi> before they press their hearers therewithal; and that spin out of their own Bowels the Silk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Garments of Righteousness for their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. <hi>Ministers,</hi> that like the Blessed <hi>Bradford</hi> make their Sermons on their <hi>Knees,</hi> and fetch from Heaven the <hi>Manna</hi> with which they feed our Souls; O little do we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, how <hi>well</hi> all Things are like to <hi>go</hi> within the reach of Ministers, which thus always lie in the Bosome of the Lord Jesus Christ.

You know that not only <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> and <hi>Joshua,</hi> but, <hi>All the People of the Land,</hi> must be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon, to Do what they can for the Good Order of their Affayrs. When there are <hi>Ill Spirits,</hi> and <hi>Ill Doings</hi> prevailing among a People, all Things will be <hi>Ill-going</hi> there, let their Overseers do what they can unto the contrary. Indeed, I cannot more Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positely to this purpose Express my self, than in the Words of a Great Writer, which would certainly help us to more Infallible Divinations, than the Absurd and Juggling Pamphlets of the <hi>Astrologers,</hi> which in the E<hi>nglish</hi> Nation are so fondly Doted on. They are these; <hi>When God is Angry with a people, and intends to Dash them to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; He leaves them without Heart, without Counsel, without Strength, without fit Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; Involv'd so with</hi> D<hi>ifficulties Forreign and Domestick, they know not how to</hi> E<hi>xtricate themselves. If one give good Counsel, presently another by Captious Arguments overthrows it, and those that should Judge of both, have not Light enough to discern which is for the publick Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and which Destructive. If any Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Service be presented, either there is no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice taken of it, or to save a little Charges, it
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:000623_0066_0FA95F10CB7AD3D8"/>
is Neglected; or, none knows how to Improve it. Dangers Imminent, are, either not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen, or slighted: Traitors creep in, which Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their Counsels to their</hi> E<hi>nemies. There are Jealousies and Factions among their Great Men, in favour whereof, one studies to cross the Designs and Successes of the other, tho' the Publick be undone by it. The Treasury is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted in Needless Expences. And finally, while all seek their own profit, and no mans Heart is upon the Publick Good; all runs to ruine.</hi> Thus my Author. Nor would a thousand Blazing Stars over the Heads of a People, portend more against Things <hi>Go well</hi> among them, than the Black Omens that have been thus recounted. But if we then make the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Psalmist, <hi>Show me a Token for Good;</hi> I say, Let such Things be seen, as we are now going to Enumerate.</p>
            <p>First. Things will <hi>Go well,</hi> when a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple improve their Interest in the <hi>Legislation,</hi> for the Establishing of <hi>Good Laws</hi> among them. 'Tis not the least among the <hi>Rights</hi> of the E<hi>nglish</hi> Nation, That the <hi>People</hi> are to be concerned, in the making of the <hi>Laws</hi> whereby they must be Governed: And our Plantations also have, I hope, their Indisputable Claim to that Invaluable Right. But may we now be <hi>Good Stewards</hi> of such a Talent; and not be so Remiss and Careless
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:000623_0067_0FA95F13A6ECAD08"/>
in the using of our priviledges, that a brave Roman should censure us, with a, <hi>Qnos non decet esse nisi Servos,</hi> or, people unfit for any thing but <hi>Slavery.</hi> 'Tis by its <hi>Laws,</hi> that <hi>England</hi> is the <hi>Paradise</hi> of the <hi>old</hi> World; and by its <hi>Laws</hi> may <hi>New-England</hi> be the <hi>Paradise</hi> of the <hi>New.</hi> As on the contrary? Things cannot <hi>Go well,</hi> where, <hi>Mischief is framed by a Law.</hi> Let a people have <hi>Laws</hi> that shall make every <hi>Vicious</hi> Thing, to be both Disgraceful and Expensive unto all that shall commit it; and <hi>Laws,</hi> that shall ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all that is <hi>Vertuous</hi> to be Meritorious. <hi>Then,</hi> as when there were such <hi>Laws,</hi> 'twas said, in Deut. 4. 6. T<hi>he Nations that shall hear all these Statutes, will say, surely, This Great Nation is a Wise and Understanding Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:</hi> Even so, all Spectators will say, <hi>Surely, Things go well with such a people.</hi> Be sure, Things did not <hi>Go well</hi> in that Kingdom, whereof, <hi>Nicolaus de Clemangis</hi> once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, <hi>There was more Righteousness in Hell, than in that</hi> K<hi>ingdom;</hi> for in Hell, no Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Man is Afflicted, nor any Wicked Man unjustly punished. But among <hi>Laws,</hi> those that concern the Regulation of <hi>Taxes,</hi> are of a very particular force to make Things <hi>Go well</hi> among those that have them. 'Tis true, that an exact E<hi>quality</hi> in <hi>Taxes,</hi> is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to be despaired of; yet it were ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:000623_0068_0FA95F14B37D7520"/>
to Tender probable Expedients for a Nearer <hi>Equality</hi> in them, than has been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet attained. And it seems but <hi>Equal</hi> indeed, that as many of the <hi>Taxes</hi> as may be, should be laid upon the <hi>Vanities,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in people are most prone amiss to Indulge themselves; not only the <hi>vile Drunkenness,</hi> but also the <hi>strange Apparrel,</hi> too ready to creep in upon us, would be notably Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched, if <hi>Taxes</hi> laid upon the Fuel of those Lusts, did fetch out of them, what they might yield unto the publick Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suries. Were but this one sort of <hi>Laws</hi> well adjusted, we might soon come to this, That there would be, <hi>No Complaining in our Streets;</hi> and you know the Psalmist adds upon that, <hi>Happy is that People, that is in such a case;</hi> that is, Things <hi>Go well</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong such a people. Only, when all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Laws</hi> are well-directed, we may like <hi>Solon</hi> of old, Wish for <hi>one Law</hi> more; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>A Law</hi> to provide effectually for the E<hi>xecution</hi> of all the Rest; <hi>A Law</hi> to make it a very dangerous Thing for <hi>Officers</hi> to Neglect the Duty of their places; <hi>A Law</hi> to prevent the fulfilment of that unhappy Diverb, <hi>That men play with Oaths, as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren do with</hi> S<hi>hells,</hi> altho' they be Sworn to <hi>Do Justice and Judgment.</hi> O Thrice, and Four Times, <hi>Happy indeed the People that are in such a case.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="unknown:000623_0069_0FA95F154E9E62C8"/>
Secondly. Things will <hi>Go well,</hi> when a <hi>Liberal</hi> E<hi>ducation</hi> is Liberally Countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and Encouraged among a people.—<hi>Ingenuas Didicisse fideliter Artes.</hi>—Let <hi>Arts</hi> once <hi>Go well</hi> among a people; and that will be one way for all T<hi>hings</hi> else to do so too. MEN, are the best Things a people have; nor can Things <hi>Go well</hi> among those that have no MEN among them. Now to the making of such as deserve to be called MEN, 'tis well known that Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed S<hi>chools</hi> are altogether Necessary! And hence, among the people of God, even when Immediate and Extraordinary <hi>Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,</hi> were more granted than in our Dayes, yet <hi>Schools of the Prophets,</hi> were in request; and the Great <hi>Samuel</hi> himself was President of a <hi>Colledge.</hi> The Jews tell us, that the <hi>Hill pertaining to Phinehas,</hi> whereof there is mention in the last Words of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua's</hi> History, had a <hi>Colledge</hi> upon it, which <hi>Phinehas</hi> himself, was the Rector of. Thus when we read in I Sam. 10. 5. About, <hi>The Hill of God, where was a Station of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines;</hi> the Jews inform us, there was a Colledge of young Prophets upon that Hill; which the Barbarous <hi>Philistines</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, did not care to Demolish, because of the <hi>Divine Studies,</hi> which were followed in that Academy. Yea, a Learned <hi>Rabbi</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:000623_0070_0FA95F1677763A18"/>
us, That in the Dayes of the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> there were no less than Four Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred &amp; Fourscore <hi>Schools</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> it self; and the <hi>Talmud</hi> acquaints us, That both the Tutors and Scholars of those Learned Societies were free from Civil <hi>Tasks</hi> and <hi>Rates,</hi> and all other publick Burdens. This was the practice of the pious <hi>Hebrews;</hi> and I might add, that the profane <hi>Pagans</hi> themselves had so much Discretion too, as to see, that S<hi>chools</hi> were needful to make Things <hi>Go well</hi> among them. It would insinuate some undue Suspicion of you, if I should enlarge on this point; but, how importunately is it now to be desired, That the like S<hi>chools</hi> may be supported among our selves! I cannot but utter, and, I hope all the Ministers in the Country will joyn with me in uttering, the pathetical Wishes of our Departed ELIOT; <hi>For good Schools every where among us; That every Member of the Assembly may go Home, and procure a good School, in the Town where he lives! That before we Dy, we may be so Happy as to see a good</hi> S<hi>chool, in every Plantation of the Countrey!</hi> Then would things <hi>Go Well</hi> indeed. It was <hi>Julians</hi> policy, to undo the Christians, by putting down of their <hi>Schools;</hi> and it may be <hi>Satans</hi> policy to undo <hi>us,</hi> by thus making of this Gradually to become, <hi>A Land of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
               <pb n="65" facs="unknown:000623_0071_0FA95F16E78700D8"/>
Hereby, 'twould in truth soon become <hi>His own Again!</hi> &amp; the <hi>New-Englanders</hi> would become A BASE PEOPLE, in a little while. But while I am thus a Petitioner for the Life of the <hi>Schools,</hi> let me put in a good word, peculiarly for my dear Mother, THE COLLEDGE, with which this Wilderness has been Subdued and Ennobled. We are not Ignorant, how vigorously, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent <hi>Reformers</hi> of the Last Century, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd themselves, to set up Colledges every where; without which, how miserably had the <hi>Reformation</hi> sunk! When the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> had Received a Miraculous <hi>D</hi>eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from the S<hi>paniards,</hi> they, to shew their Thankfulness, Erected and Endowed a Colledge at <hi>Leyden,</hi> with most ample pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges; and all the World has had cause to bless God for that University. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap>trely, 'Twould be an Ill Return for the benefits of God, bestow'd upon our selves, if we should not now do something for our COLLEDGE, among the <hi>First Things</hi> we do. The Admirable <hi>Voetius,</hi> could happily boast of it; that whereas there are no less than Ten Provinces in the Popish <hi>Belgium,</hi> there are no more than Two Universities in them; when, tho' there are but Seven Provinces in the Reformed <hi>Belgium,</hi> there are Five Universities therein, besides other
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:000623_0072_0FA95F185FD8A238"/>
Academical Societies. May <hi>We,</hi> have the like Regards unto Learning, far exceeding what is to be found in <hi>Canada</hi> and <hi>Mexico!</hi> And may our zeal for an <hi>University,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Emulation of <hi>Barbados</hi> and <hi>Virginia,</hi> till <hi>they</hi> also have settled among them such Nurseries for Learning, as the <hi>Good Spirits</hi> there have long bin wishing for. Alas, How far from <hi>well</hi> had things <hi>gone</hi> among us, if our Fathers had not formed, that Eles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed COLLEDGE, of our <hi>Cambridge!</hi> When things <hi>went well</hi> with <hi>Israel,</hi> there was that Memorandum of it, in <hi>Amos.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>I Raised up of your sons for Prophets; Is it not even thus, O ye Children of Israel?</hi> And Things have <hi>gone well</hi> with <hi>New-England,</hi> because of such a vast Convenience for us. We cannot conceive that <hi>Europe</hi> would have sent us over MEN enough to answer our Necessities; but if we had not been thus among our selves provided for, <hi>Darkness had soon covered the Land, and gross Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness the People.</hi> But I pray mark what I say; <hi>If Contempt of Learning once become the prevailing Spirit of this Country, we are a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple apace Running down in all sorts of Ruines unavoidable.</hi> May there be then placed the Marks of our singular Affection, upon that <hi>River, The Streams whereof have made Glad, the City of God!</hi> It is That upon which
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:000623_0073_0FA95F190C2C4D70"/>
depends the welfare of the next, as well as the present Generation; And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hac Casti maneant in Religione Nepotes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly. Things will <hi>go well,</hi> when a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do neither <hi>want,</hi> nor <hi>chill,</hi> any <hi>Publick Spirits</hi> among them. What is the first cause, why things do not <hi>go well</hi> in our dayes? Tis intimated in 2 Tim. 3. 1. 2. <hi>In the Last days perillous times shall come:</hi> Why so? First, <hi>Because men shall be lovers of their own</hi> S<hi>elves.</hi> That is, men shall so <hi>Love Themselves,</hi> as to love no body else. But when there is a plentiful sett of men, that are sincerely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to <hi>Know</hi> what they may D<hi>o,</hi> and to <hi>Do</hi> what they shall <hi>Know,</hi> for the service of the Publick; Such men will do much to make things <hi>go well</hi> where they come. They that have a single Eye at, <hi>The good of many,</hi> in such things as they propose and pursue; They with whom the old Heathenish ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, <hi>Pietas in Patriam,</hi> is become a Christian Grace; and they whose chief Mark is not, T<hi>hey seek their own things,</hi> will cause Things to <hi>go well</hi> indeed! A Souldier in a Battel, having received his Deaths-wound, cryed out, <hi>O that I had another life to lose for my Lord-Jesus Christ!</hi> They that are Blest
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:000623_0074_0FA95F1A61AF42B0"/>
with many persons who are spirited like so brave a <hi>Souldier;</hi> Persons willing to part with any thing for the Lord Jesus Christ and his people; persons who count not all that is done or spent, for the Publick, meerly thrown away, while they can <hi>Lavish out of the Bag,</hi> upon every little impertinency; These will see things <hi>go well</hi> among them. It was a most unhappy thing, that an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent <hi>Venetian</hi> Embassador, after a long residence in <hi>England,</hi> Sailing homeward, should not without cause cast his Eye back on the Land, and say, <hi>The Happiest country on the face of the</hi> E<hi>arth, were there not a want of Publick Spirits in it!</hi> And it will as much forebode things <hi>going</hi> not <hi>well,</hi> in our <hi>New</hi>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>E<hi>ngland,</hi> if the like lamentations must be made upon us. How should Things <hi>go well</hi> when every thing is begrutch'd that should make them <hi>Go!</hi> I am very sure, Things did not <hi>go well</hi> in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> when the Citizens would not be at the Charges of Defending their walls; whereby the <hi>Turks</hi> became the Masters of their Wealth, whereof they found vast Coffers hoard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up. No, a few <hi>Publick Spirits</hi> will make all to <hi>go well.</hi> Only then, tis of inexpressible importance, that <hi>Publick Servants</hi> be not abused for what they do. Let not unreasonable Reproaches, and Revilings, and Hard Speeches, too Reasonably and roverbially be called <hi>Country, pay for worthy
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:000623_0075_0FA95F1B4C730AD0"/>
men.</hi> If when men have been doing their best for the removal of Throtling circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances from a people, they must count it Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence Enough to escape without having their <hi>Heads</hi> bitten off: And if when men have been <hi>Showing favour and Lending,</hi> for the support of a distressed people, they shall be requited with unjust censures of, I know not what, <hi>Selfishness,</hi> in what they do; Or if when men have with <hi>Inviolate Integrity and Unfainting Industry,</hi> been serving of their people, they shall be treated with unworthy <hi>Infamies,</hi> and perhaps be Blamed as the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours</hi> of those very Inconveniences against which they have most Vehemently, though Ineffectually, Laboured; it will at last come to this, that every man of sense will say, <hi>I will never be an Healer to such a people!</hi> But would that be <hi>well,</hi> I beseech you? Things <hi>went well</hi> with the people of God, when <hi>Gideon,</hi> that had ventured his Life to serve them, had them saying to him, <hi>Thou shalt rule over us:</hi> But they <hi>Go</hi> not <hi>Well,</hi> where all the services done by a <hi>Joseph</hi> shall find no better memories, than <hi>Riven Dishes</hi> to retain them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly. Things will <hi>Go well,</hi> when people, having laid aside all Dividing and Contentious <hi>Animosities,</hi> do come to <hi>Love one another.</hi> I have good Authority for this
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:000623_0076_0FA95F1C0DE192D8"/>
Assertion; even, the Word of God Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, in Psal. 133. 1, 3. <hi>Behold, how good, and how pleasant it is, for Brethren to Dwell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Unity.—There the Lord Commanded the Blessing:</hi> And surely, Things will <hi>Go well,</hi> when they have the <hi>Blessing</hi> of God, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded upon them. But Things cannot <hi>Go well,</hi> where there is <hi>Every evil work;</hi> and you know where that is. Especially, <hi>we</hi> may say it, If, T<hi>he Mountain of the Lords House,</hi> become, <hi>A Mountain of Bether,</hi> it will not be a <hi>Mount,</hi> whereof any Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of our Lord can have cause to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, <hi>It is good to be here!</hi> When People are <hi>Vultures</hi> and <hi>Harpies</hi> one unto another, they disoblige that <hi>Spirit,</hi> who has taken on Himself, the Representation of a <hi>Dove;</hi> and when that <hi>Spirit</hi> is <hi>vexed,</hi> he causes all things to fall out <hi>vexatiously,</hi> among those who have made <hi>Him</hi> their <hi>Enemy.</hi> The People that are always Enkindling and Fomenting of Sinful <hi>Fires</hi> among them, will provoke the, <hi>God of Love and Peace,</hi> to say, <hi>These people are as a Smoke in my Nostrils, Ile be gone from them.</hi> But let people have no such <hi>Fires,</hi> among them, and they will procure a <hi>Sabbath</hi> for themselves, a little Anticipating of that <hi>New Jerusalem,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all Things will <hi>Go well</hi> among the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

&amp; Hatreds which would Embarass our Affayrs, the <hi>Names</hi> might be Remanded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that side of the Ocean, where those <hi>Names</hi> had their first Original.

Things to <hi>Go well</hi> among the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants of the <hi>Former</hi> Century; it is this. The <hi>Wolves</hi> going forth to Battel against the <hi>Doggs,</hi> first sent a <hi>Scout</hi> forth, to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Strength of the Enemy.

Question, <hi>Of what Occupation are you? Diligent Hands</hi> make all things to <hi>Go Well,</hi> where they come. Things would <hi>Go Well</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ourselves, if our very <hi>Children</hi> might not only mentain themselves, but assist the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Charges also too; and at the same time have an Ingenuous education freely besto'wd upon them. And yet I suppose, <hi>A ll This</hi> might be accomplished, if a little advice were hearkened unto! However, as it helps not a little to make things <hi>Go Well</hi> in <hi>Old-England,</hi> that those whom the Law calls <hi>Idlers,</hi> have suitable <hi>Corrections</hi> ordered for them; So things did <hi>Go Well</hi> in our <hi>New-England,</hi> when one Returning home to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> could in a Sermon before the Lord Mayor, declare, <hi>I have newly spent seven years in a Country, where all that while, I never saw one Man Drunk, Or heard one Oath Sworn, Or beheld so much as one Beggar in the Land.</hi> God forbid, that now in the Room of our wasted <hi>Indians,</hi> there should rise up an <hi>Unworking</hi> and <hi>Indigent</hi> Generation of English, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured like them: <hi>That</hi> would be a thing too <hi>Ill</hi> for us to find a <hi>Worse!</hi>

            <p>Sixthly, Things will G<hi>o Well,</hi> when peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>Remember the Sabbath Day, to keep it holy.</hi> They that, <hi>Keep the Sabbath from polluting it,</hi> will be likely to, <hi>Keep their Land from feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Evil too.</hi> It is <hi>Well</hi> foretold in Isa 58. 13 14.

               <hi>If thou call the Sabbath a delight the Holy of the Lord Honourable; Then shalt thou delight thy self in the Lord;</hi>[There are Spiritual Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings!] <hi>And I will cause thee to Ride on the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>places of the earth.</hi> [Here are Temporal Blessings also!] It was no Injudicious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, of that Admirable Person, the Lord Chief Justice <hi>Hale; That be could or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily form a probable Conjecture, how all matters would prosper with him all the week, by the manner of his Keeping the Sabbath Day.</hi> It seems we may give a shrow'd guess, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things are like to <hi>Go well,</hi> among us, by the Respect which we give to the <hi>Sabbath</hi> of our God. The Holy God, will wonderfully <hi>Break</hi> the <hi>Rest</hi> of that Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing People, that shall not K<hi>eep</hi> His Holy <hi>Rest.</hi> Among the Looser Protestants abroad, the Doctrine of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> has been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busively called, <hi>Figmentum Anglicanum;</hi> An <hi>English Fancy.</hi> But is it any <hi>Fancy,</hi> ye <hi>Sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Virgins;</hi> That God has with a long Train of Desolations, been taking away a <hi>Sabbath</hi> from you? Is it any <hi>Fancy,</hi> that you can get no <hi>Rest,</hi> but are, <hi>Afflicted and Tossed with Tempests, and not Comforted?</hi> Oh That they would Consider of it! A Person of Quality, reflecting upon, <hi>The Tears of Germany,</hi> Printed Fifty Years ago, saw cause to say, he believed, the Wars of <hi>Germany</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="unknown:000623_0082_0FA95F220E5C3948"/>
would not be over yet, <hi>Because in a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of their,</hi> Provoking Evils, <hi>there is no Confession made of the,</hi> Sabbath-breaking, <hi>too common among them.</hi> And you know how <hi>Ill</hi> all Things have since gone in those parts of the World! When poor <hi>England</hi> was fill'd with S<hi>ports</hi> on the <hi>Lords-Day,</hi> what an horrible <hi>Day of the Lord</hi> soon came upon the Nation? What Bloody, Fiery <hi>Wars,</hi> quickly overwhelmed the Nation, and most particularly the Authors of those Unlawful <hi>Sports?</hi> Blessed be God, for the Regard which the <hi>English Laws</hi> have since had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Sabbath</hi> of our Lord; Laws worthy to be written in <hi>Letters of Gold;</hi> yea, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to he Engraven in our Conversations, by the point of that <hi>Sword, which is not to be Born in vain!</hi> Would we have Things to <hi>Go well,</hi> among us, by our speedy entring into the <hi>Twilight</hi> of that, <hi>Rest which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains for the People of God?</hi> Let us devoutly Sanctify that Weekly <hi>Rest,</hi> by prescribing whereof our God hath so abundantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted our Welfare; yea, let all <hi>within our Gates,</hi> be so Restrained, from open viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this High Day, that it may not be said unto them, <hi>Ye bring Wrath upon your Country, by Profaning the Sabbath.</hi>
            </p>

If any one ask, unto what the Sudden and Matchless thriving of <hi>New-England</hi> may be ascribed? It is the Blessing of God upon the <hi>Church-Order,</hi> for the sake whereof, [<hi>Let all Mankind know</hi>] this Plantation was first Erected: Things have <hi>Gone Well,</hi> while our worldly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations have been Subordinated unto that GREAT INTEREST: And God has Built and Fill'd our <hi>Houses</hi> while we have been doing so for <hi>His.</hi> Our <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>State</hi> is our <hi>Glory;</hi> and as it is said, in Isa.45.<hi>Upon all the Glory shall be a Defence;</hi> thus all things will <hi>go well,</hi> where there is this <hi>Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Defcended Glory!</hi> If once our people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come generally careless about <hi>Church-Work,</hi> it will soon come to that issue, whereof a young Prophet in a vast Assembly once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished the Backsliding Jews; <hi>In those Times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in; but God vexed them with all adversity.</hi> What is it, that brings the B<hi>lasting</hi> Strokes of Heaven, upon a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? <hi>When they look for much, Lo, it comes

to</hi> L<hi>ittle;</hi> and all things <hi>go ill</hi> among them; Whence is it? I pray, Take the God of Heavens answer to that enquiry; <hi>It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of my House, that is wast, and yerun every man to his own House.</hi> Only, that things may <hi>go well,</hi> we must be concerned for this also, <hi>That the Altar be set upon its right Bases;</hi> That we keep close to our Scriptural, <hi>Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form of Church-Discipline;</hi> That we have our Churches framed, according to, <hi>The pattern in the Mount.</hi> Let the Things of a True <hi>Church-Order</hi> Flourish well in the midst of a people; and all things will <hi>go well</hi> among them; Let us be duely careful, <hi>To dwell in the House of the Lord;</hi> and we need not fear <hi>but Goodness &amp; Mercy shall follow us all our Dayes.</hi> To retrench our Churches of all that may be offensive unto the Glorious Eyes of the Lord Jesus, who walks <hi>In the midst of the Golden Candlesticks:</hi> To supply our Churches with all those things which our Lord Jesus ha's appointed for the <hi>Edifying of the Body of Christ;</hi> and for us to procure ourselves a <hi>Lodging</hi> in Churches thus instituted: THIS would be at all Times our security; but NOW more peculiarly. I can with Good assurance forewarn you of a FLOOD, an Horrible! Yea, a HERY FLOOD, coming apace upon a sinful world.

the <hi>Arks</hi> for safety: in the day of that <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing Scourge.</hi> I Know not what to say of a Story which we have, that, In the Primitive Times a terrible <hi>Earthquake</hi> befel a great City, wherein all the Houses fell, Except those whereon an Eminent Person then saw an <hi>Angel</hi> writing those words CHRIST WITH US. But this I know, That the way for a people to escape falling in that Horrendous <hi>Earthquake,</hi> which is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun upon the Nations, is to obtain the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of, CHRIST WITH US; <hi>Then</hi> may we sing, <hi>We will not fear, tho the earth be removed and the mountains be carried into the midst of the Sea.</hi> And this I know; That the way for us to have, CHRIST WITH US, in this Overturning <hi>Earthquake,</hi> is to have and own as much as we can, the Ordinances of an Evangelical <hi>Church-State</hi> among us; <hi>Those</hi> Evangelical Things are the <hi>Things that cannot be shaken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis a most amazing <hi>Revolution</hi> that those dear People of God, the <hi>Waldenses</hi> have newly seen. That Blessed People have had, as 'tis the Motto of their Arms, <hi>The Light shining in Darkness,</hi> among them from the very first Ages of Christianity; and all the infandous <hi>Croisaides</hi> made against them, were never able to Extirpate them; till t'other Day the Leagued <hi>French King,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> together did effect their

But behold; just <hi>three years and an half,</hi> after the Last Abjuration, which broke up those Illustrious Churches, a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Life from God is entred into them.</hi> In the sight and spite of all their Adversaries, they have with a Series of Miracles fighting for them, Repossessed themselves of their Country; and their Two Persecutors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming bitter Enemies one unto another, have been hard striving who shall first, and most gain these <hi>Vaudois</hi> unto their party. Those Churches of <hi>Piedmont</hi> which are, as it were the <hi>Root</hi> of all the Protestant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches being thus <hi>Revived,</hi> it marvellously Confirms the conjecture, so often published among you, That the last Persecution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over, we are got into those Dreadful E<hi>arthquakes,</hi> with which the <hi>Resurrection of our Lords Witnesses,</hi> is to be accompanyed.
