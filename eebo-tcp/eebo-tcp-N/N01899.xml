            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

A <hi>Loud Sound</hi> indeed; ſo <hi>Loud,</hi> as to Awaken them that have a <hi>Dead Sleep</hi> upon them! So <hi>Loud,</hi> as to convey <hi>Life</hi> unto them that <hi>Ly Dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins!</hi> Yea, Joh. V. 25. <hi>The Hour now is, when the Dead hear the Voice of the Son of GOD, and Live.</hi> The <hi>Sound</hi> of this <hi>Trumpet</hi> fetches back the Loſt Souls of all the Elect, <hi>from the power of Satan unto GOD.</hi> They are not <hi>Silver Trumpets,</hi> that are now <hi>Sounding</hi> unto us; But they are <hi>Saving Trumpets! Faith</hi> comes, the <hi>Love</hi> of GOD comes, the <hi>Love</hi> of our Neighbour comes, and the Foretaſte of <hi>Heaven</hi> comes, <hi>by the Hearing</hi> of them. What are they, But the <hi>Power of GOD unto Salvation!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly; 'Tis a <hi>Good Sound,</hi> as well as a <hi>Great</hi> one. No <hi>Trumpets</hi> can give ſo <hi>Good,</hi> ſo Grateful, ſo Lovely, a <hi>Sound,</hi> as the <hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> do. <hi>Fame</hi> often in her <hi>Trumpet,</hi> has a <hi>Sound,</hi> which may not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied upon; But every <hi>Trumpet</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi>

XXV. 25. <hi>As cold water to a Thirſty ſoul, ſo is Good News from a far Country.</hi> In the <hi>Trumpets</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> we have the <hi>Sound</hi> of nothing but <hi>Good News from a far Country.</hi> The <hi>Sound</hi> which we hear in the <hi>Trumpets</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> is what was once heard from the Mouth of an <hi>Angel;</hi> Luk. II. 10. <hi>Behold,</hi> I <hi>bring you Good Tidings of Great Joy, that unto you there is born a SAVIOUR.</hi> Wherever the <hi>Goſpel</hi> comes, there is a <hi>

'Tis the <hi>Goſpel of Peace;</hi> The <hi>Trumpets</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> are <hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets</hi> of <hi>Peace.</hi> The <hi>Sound</hi> of theſe <hi>Trumpets</hi> is, <hi>A Reconciliation with GOD obtained for Sinners; The Anger of GOD now turn'd away from thoſe, whom He was once Angry withal!</hi> The <hi>Trumpets</hi> which gave the <hi>Law,</hi> had a <hi>Sound</hi> that was trembled at.

And were are the Spiritual Bleſſings of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Places reſerved for thee!</hi> Oh! <hi>Joyful ſound!</hi> How Reviving, how Raviſhing! When the <hi>Goſpel</hi> was Preached with Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, we read, Act. VIII. 8. <hi>There was great Joy in the City.</hi> Well might there be ſo, on ſuch a <hi>Joyful ſound!</hi> How <hi>Joyful</hi> is the Souldier, when the <hi>Trumpets</hi> invite him, <hi>To the Spoil! To the Spoil!</hi> The <hi>Joyful ſound</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> carries this in it: Elſe it had not been ſaid, <hi>I rejoyce at thy Word, as one that findeth great Spoil.</hi> The <hi>Bleſſings</hi> which the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD leads us to, are Matchleſs Treaſures.

            <p n="2">II. In order to <hi>Bleſſedneſs,</hi> it is Requiſite, not only that we <hi>Have,</hi> but alſo that we <hi>Know,</hi> the <hi>Joyful Sound,</hi> which is brought unto us, in the Goſpel, and in the Ordinances of it. Indeed, in a larger ſenſe,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002246_0013_0FDAD8279B296650"/>To <hi>Have</hi> the <hi>Joyful ſound,</hi> is to <hi>Know</hi> it. A People that <hi>Have</hi> the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and <hi>Know</hi> the <hi>Joyful ſound,</hi> in the <hi>External Enjoyment</hi> of it, theſe do Enjoy a Rich Favour of GOD. The Places which Enjoy the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and have the <hi>Church ſtate,</hi> with the <hi>Faith &amp; Order of the Goſpel,</hi> are therein highly Favoured of the Lord. <hi>Gideons</hi> Fleece, wet with the Dews of Heaven, when the Ground all about is Dry, has a ſingular <hi>Token for Good</hi> upon it. The <hi>Sound</hi> of the <hi>Trumpets</hi> which proclaim the Kingdom of GOD, is heard in ſome Happy Lands, while others are left unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it: <hi>Even ſo, Righteous Father, Becauſe it pleaſes thee!</hi> And ſo far they have a Singular Happineſs. It may be ſaid unto them, as in Matth.

In ſuch a <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the <hi>Joyful ſound,</hi> as will render a People a <hi>Bleſſed People,</hi> there is more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, than a meer Hearing of it. To <hi>Know</hi> the <hi>Joyful ſound,</hi> as it ſhould be <hi>Known,</hi> is to <hi>Know</hi> the <hi>Meaning</hi> of it, the <hi>Value</hi> of it, the <hi>Credit</hi> of it, and the <hi>Power</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Firſt. There are People who <hi>Diſcern</hi> the <hi>Joyful ſound.</hi> The <hi>Silver Trumpets</hi> of old, were <hi>Diſtinct</hi> and <hi>Signal</hi> in the <hi>Sound</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The Marches, the Motions, the Stands, of the Armies paſſing thro' the Wilderneſs, were directed by the <hi>Sound.</hi> The <hi>Trumpets</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> give <hi>Orders</hi> unto us; we are to take our <hi>Meaſures</hi> from their <hi>Joyful ſound.</hi> People <hi>Know</hi> the <hi>Joyful ſound,</hi> when they <hi>Underſtand</hi> the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>Mind of the Lord.</hi> There are thoſe under the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> to whom our Lord ſays, as He once did unto His Diſciples after Sermon; Matt. XIII. 51. <hi>Have ye underſtood</hi> all theſe things? And they can reply, <hi>Yea, Lord!</hi> We may ſay concerning the <hi>Trumpets</hi> of the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> as was of old ſaid concerning the <hi>Pauline</hi> Epiſtles; <hi>There are in them, ſome things hard to be underſtood.</hi> But there are People who
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002246_0015_0FDAD82D80D6C860"/>do competently <hi>Underſtand</hi> them. They readily perceive the Language of the <hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,</hi> about the whole <hi>Myſtery of</hi> CHRIST, and the Homage that we owe unto Him; 'Tis not a <hi>Strange Language</hi> unto them.</p>
            <p>O <hi>Bleſſed People,</hi> who ſo <hi>Know</hi> the <hi>Joyful ſound!</hi> We remember the Speech of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> about the <hi>People which know not the Law,</hi>—How juſtly to be ſpoken about the <hi>People,</hi> who <hi>Know not the Goſpel!</hi> But then, <hi>Bleſſed the People, who do know it!</hi> How it thunders, in Iſai. XXVII. 11. <hi>It is a People of no Underſtanding; Therefore He that made them will not have Mercy on them; He that formed them, will ſhew them no Favour.</hi> But then on the other ſide; <hi>A People that Underſtand well the Joyful ſound, are a People that GOD has much Mercy for; much Favour for; A Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple greatly Bleſſed of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly. There are People who <hi>Eſteem</hi> the <hi>Joyful ſound.</hi> They ſo <hi>Know</hi> it, as to <hi>Prize</hi> it; Set a vaſt <hi>Price</hi> upon it. In the Bible, Words of <hi>Knowledge</hi> do ſignify ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Affection</hi> too. Some ſo <hi>Know</hi> the <hi>Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſound,</hi> as to be <hi>Well-affected</hi> unto it; Yea, to <hi>Prefer</hi> it above their <hi>Chiefeſt Joy.</hi> There are People, who had rather be with <hi>David,</hi> where they may <hi>hear what GOD the Lord ſhall ſay</hi> unto them in the <hi>Silver Trumpets</hi> of the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002246_0016_0FDAD7F409305350"/>Goſpel, than be with <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> at a Bout where <hi>Golden Veſſels</hi> are carouſed in. They count no <hi>Melody</hi> like that which is to be heard in the <hi>Courts</hi> of the Lord: And look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the <hi>Silver Trumpets,</hi> they ſay, as he, Pſal.

            </p>
            <p>O <hi>Bleſſed People,</hi> who ſo <hi>Know</hi> the <hi>Joyful ſound!</hi> We are told, Pſal. CXIX. 165. <hi>Great Peace have they that Love thy Law.</hi> If the <hi>Trumpets</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> have our <hi>Love,</hi> they will then ſpeak our <hi>Peace,</hi> cauſe our <hi>Peace.</hi> The <hi>Fruit</hi> of the <hi>Lips,</hi> that blow in thoſe <hi>Trumpets,</hi> is, <hi>Peace, Peace, and all the Bleſſings of Goodneſs!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly. There are People who <hi>Believe</hi> the <hi>Joyful ſound.</hi> We read of, the <hi>Good Seed, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into good and Honeſt Hearts;</hi> Thus there is the <hi>Good Sound coming into Good and Honeſt Ears.</hi> There are ſome, that find no <hi>Jarrs</hi> in the <hi>Sound</hi> of the <hi>Silver Trumpets;</hi> They raiſe no <hi>Diſputes</hi> about it; they ſtart no <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils</hi> upon it. It was a noble <hi>Confeſſion of Faith;</hi> Act. XXIV. 14. <hi>I worſhip GOD, Believing
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002246_0017_0FDAD82E51B9EB08"/>all things, which are written in the Law and the Prophets.</hi> Thus, There are People who <hi>Live unto GOD,</hi> and <hi>Live by the Faith of the Son of GOD;</hi> And it is becauſe, they <hi>Believe all things that are Sounded in the Trumpets of the Goſpel.</hi> About the <hi>Trumpets</hi> that <hi>Sounded</hi> on <hi>Sinai,</hi> it was the perſwaſion of the Godly People in all after ages; <hi>Lord, Thou ſpakeſt with them from Heaven, and gaveſt them Right Judgments.</hi> Truly, In the <hi>Trumpets</hi> that we have <hi>Sounding</hi> from <hi>Zion,</hi> we have <hi>the Lord ſpeaking from Heaven unto us,</hi> and we have <hi>Right Judgments</hi> in them. This is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of the People that <hi>Know Right Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> They embrace the Goſpel, with <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſatisfied, and Faith eſtabliſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O <hi>Bleſſed People,</hi> who ſo know the <hi>Joyful ſound!</hi> The <hi>Unbeliever</hi> is always under the Wrath of GOD. The portion of the <hi>Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever</hi> is for ever to be deprecated. But our Lord hath aſſured us, Joh. XX. 29. <hi>Bleſſed are they that have Believed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly. There are People that <hi>Obey</hi> the <hi>Joyful ſound.</hi> We are informed. 1 Joh. II. 4. <hi>He that ſaith, I know him, and keepeth not his Commandments, is a Lyar.</hi> There are ſome who ſo <hi>Know,</hi> as to <hi>Do:</hi> They <hi>know practically,</hi> Their <hi>Knowledge</hi> has their <hi>Practice</hi> conform'd
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002246_0018_0FDAD7F5AA526960"/>unto it. They <hi>Hear</hi> the <hi>Trumpets</hi> of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and they are not the <hi>ſelf deceivers,</hi> who are no <hi>Doers,</hi> but <hi>Hearers</hi> only. When the <hi>Sound</hi> of the <hi>Silver-Trumpets,</hi> is, <hi>Repair among them who have liſted themſelves under the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their SAVIOUR:</hi> Then theſe People come and put themſelves under the Conduct of the Lord, who is <hi>an Enſign for the People.</hi> If the <hi>Sound</hi> of the <hi>Silver-Trumpets</hi> be, <hi>Arm, Arm your ſelves againſt the Adverſaries that ſeek to devour you:</hi> Then theſe People <hi>put on the whole Armour of GOD.</hi> If the <hi>Sound</hi> of the <hi>Silver-Trumpets</hi> be, <hi>Fall on, Fall on, give no Quarter to the Luſts from which you have your Wounds:</hi> Then theſe People <hi>Mortify their Members which are upon the Earth.</hi> If the <hi>Sound</hi> of the <hi>Silver-Trumpets</hi> be, <hi>Retreat, Retreat out of the the Reach of the Deſtroyers?</hi> Then theſe People <hi>Abſtain from the Fleſhly Luſts which War againſt their Souls.</hi>

Oh! <hi>Bleſſed that People, whoſe GOD is the Lord;</hi> and who have a <hi>Gracious Preſence</hi> of GOD among them.

               <hi>Goſpel</hi> furniſh us with Opportunities for <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> with GOD. In them <hi>I will Commune with you,</hi> ſaith the Lord. We may herein <hi>Draw near</hi> to GOD; GOD will herein <hi>Draw near</hi> to us. The Voice of the <hi>Silver-Trumpets</hi> is, <hi>Draw near to God, and He will Draw near to you!</hi> Can any <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> be more <hi>Glorious?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT more particularly,</p>
            <p>Firſt, In the <hi>Joyful ſound,</hi> we have the <hi>Guide</hi> to <hi>Bleſſedneſs.</hi> The <hi>Silver-Trumpets</hi> put us into the way, unto the <hi>Reſt that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains for the People of God.</hi> We are ignorant of the way to <hi>Bleſſedneſs;</hi> and <hi>the way of Peace we have not known.</hi> But where the <hi>Trumpets</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> Sound, there is a fulfilment of that Word; Iſa. XXX. 21. <hi>Thine ears ſhall hear a word behind thee, ſaying, This is the way, walk in it.</hi> They reveal to us, what we are to <hi>Think,</hi> what we are to <hi>Do,</hi> what we are to <hi>wiſh</hi> for; <hi>They lead us in the way, wherein we ſhould go.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, In the <hi>Joyful ſound</hi> we have the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of <hi>Bleſſedneſs.</hi> The <hi>Silver-Trumpets</hi> are like the <hi>Golden-Pipes</hi> in <hi>Zech.</hi> IV. 12. Which convey the <hi>Golden Oyl</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> into the Souls of Men. 'Tis by them, that GOD fetches Men out of the <hi>Graves,</hi> in which they lye ſinfully and wofully putrifying; and infuſes a Principle of <hi>Piety</hi> into them; and inclines
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002246_0021_0FDAD83212C753C8"/>them to the things that are <hi>Holy, and Juſt, and Good.</hi> That <hi>Effectual Calling,</hi> which brings Men into Bleſſedneſs, 'tis in the <hi>Trumpets</hi> of the Goſpel, that the Spirit of GOD gives it unto His Choſen ones; Men <hi>Hear the Word of the Goſpel, and Believe.</hi>

               <p>BUT let us now make ſome Improvement of theſe Inſtructions.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>Bleſſed</hi> the People, who <hi>Know the Joyful ſound;</hi> Then <hi>Wretched</hi> the People, <hi>Forlorn</hi> the People, <hi>Undone</hi> the People, who are <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> to the <hi>Joyful ſound.</hi> Oh! The pity that is due unto them!</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jewiſh Nation</hi> have now loſt their <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Trumpets</hi> for theſe many Ages. And in their long Diſperſion, how pathetical is their Cry unto us. <hi>Have pity on me, O ye my Friends, have pity on me, for the Hand of the Lord hath touched me.</hi> Yea, And how many Proteſtant Churches, have in our Days, had their <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-Trumpets</hi> forced from them; and inſtead thereof heard the <hi>Enemies roaring in the midſt of the Congregations!</hi> Yea, How many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are there, that never heard the <hi>Joyful ſound!</hi> That lye buried in <hi>Paganiſing</hi> or in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan</hi> infidelity!

<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002246_0022_0FDAD7FCAA14EB30"/>thing, that ſo near unto our ſelves, there ſhould be ſo many <hi>Ungoſpellized Plantations!</hi> Our <hi>Pity</hi> for theſe, ought certainly to put us upon <hi>Prayer</hi> for them; upon <hi>Study</hi> for them; Oh! What ſhall be done for them who <hi>lye in Wickedneſs,</hi> and have this <hi>Epitaph</hi> upon them; <hi>If our Goſpel be hid, it is hid unto them that be Loſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Bleſſed</hi> the People, who <hi>Know the Joyful ſound;</hi> Then we are a <hi>Bleſſed People:</hi> And at the ſame time we are to be taught how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo.

               </p>
               <p>Oh! How <hi>Thankful</hi> ought we to be unto our GOD, for His <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of it! When the <hi>Silver-Trumpets</hi> were of old going to <hi>Sound,</hi> the <hi>Angels</hi> of GOD were heard making thoſe Acclamations thereupon, <hi>Glory to GOD in the Higheſt!</hi> And ſhall not we give <hi>Glory</hi> to the moſt High GOD, on the Occaſion!

               </p>
               <p>Such a <hi>Bleſſed People</hi> ſhould be a <hi>Thankful People.</hi> But verily, our GOD will not look on us as a <hi>Thankful People,</hi> if we are not alſo a <hi>Fruitful People.</hi> A <hi>Barren</hi> People, Oh! what a Fearful <hi>Doom</hi> are they threatned with! what a Fearful <hi>Fate</hi> are they warned of? Heb. VI. 7. <hi>It is nigh unto Curſing.</hi> Sirs, Be <hi>Fruitful</hi> in every good Work; <hi>Fruitful,</hi> and always <hi>abounding in the Work of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the midſt of theſe cares, you will uſe all due Means, that you may ſee no Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the <hi>Joyful ſound</hi> You will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide ſeaſonably, for the Succeſſion that ſhall be needful, by all due Cares about the Means of <hi>Education</hi> in our Land, without which the Land becomes a <hi>Scythian</hi> Deſart. But when you make this Proviſion, Oh! Look up to the Glorious Lord, that you may be <hi>Bleſſed</hi> with truly <hi>Silver-Trumpets:</hi> Never have any but a <hi>Man of Worth;</hi> Such as will be of <hi>Good Metal;</hi> and ſuch as in the Cauſe of GOD will always <hi>Lift up their Voice like a Trumpet.</hi>

BUT this is that which is moſt of all to be urged upon you. Hearken, Hearken, to the <hi>Joyful ſound.</hi> Hearken to it, and Comply with it. The <hi>Joyful ſound</hi> is that, <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and Return to the Lord, who will have Mercy on him.</hi> Hearken to it, and with Echo's of Devotion Reply, <hi>My GOD, I Return unto thee!</hi> The <hi>Joyful ſound</hi> is that; <hi>Come to me, all ye that labour and are heavy-laden, and I will give you Reſt.</hi> Hearken to it, and with <hi>Echo</hi>'s of Devotion Reply, <hi>My SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR, I come unto thee!</hi> That <hi>Grace of GOD which bringeth Salvation,</hi> has the <hi>Joyful ſound</hi> of the <hi>Silver Trumpets</hi> in it. Now, your <hi>Echo</hi>'s to the <hi>Trumpets</hi> muſt be thoſe; <hi>Lord, I Deſire, I Reſolve, to lead a Godly, a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, a Righteous Life before thee!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Friends, The <hi>Laſt Trumpet</hi> that is to ſound at the Appearance of the Glorious Lord, who is to <hi>Judge</hi> the World, will er'e long Summon you, to give an Account of your <hi>Compliance</hi> with the <hi>Silver Trumpets</hi> of GOD. You that now hear the <hi>Joyful ſound</hi> of theſe <hi>Trumpets,</hi> muſt er'e long hear the <hi>Awful ſound</hi> of that amazing <hi>Trumpet.</hi> A Loud, and a Shrill <hi>Trumpet</hi> will Sound, <hi>Ariſe, ye Dead, and come to Judgment!</hi> Oh!

               <p>It is utterly Unknown unto us, <hi>How</hi> and <hi>When</hi> it was, that AMERICA came to be firſt <hi>Peopled</hi> with the Inhabitants of that Olive <hi>Complexion,</hi> which, they ſay, the <hi>Biggeſt Part of Mankind</hi> is Coloured with.

               <p>We are as much at a loſs about the <hi>Time,</hi> as we are about the <hi>Way.</hi> For, though we have <hi>Evidences</hi> as well as <hi>Traditions</hi> (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the ever-Triumphing Sentiments of our Excellent <hi>Woodward</hi>) that the <hi>Flood</hi> reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto <hi>America,</hi> yet we have none, (except the Reliques of <hi>Giants,</hi> like thoſe at <hi>Albany</hi> ſhould paſs for ſuch) that <hi>America</hi> was Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled before the Flood.</p>
               <p>It is the <hi>Opinion</hi> of a Learned <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> who would fain make <hi>America</hi> to be the Seat of them that ſhall <hi>Think an evil Thought,</hi> in a Thing that is yet above a Thouſand Years off; That when the <hi>Silver Trumpets</hi> of the Goſpel, were going to Sound in the <hi>other Hemiſphere,</hi> upon the Aſcenſion of our SAVIOUR, the Devil then ſeduced Numbers into theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Regions, in hopes that the <hi>Joyful ſound</hi> thereof, never would reach hither after them.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all Expreſſion Dark were their Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a God; and <hi>Chepian,</hi> or the <hi>Evil God,</hi> had as great a ſhare as <hi>Kautantowit,</hi> or the <hi>Good God,</hi> in their Adorations, The <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheans</hi> (as great a Tribe of <hi>Hereticks</hi> as ever were in the World) may boaſt of <hi>theſe,</hi> as being really <hi>Theirs.</hi> Tho' they ſaw a People Arrive among them, who were Clothed in <hi>Habits</hi> of much more Comfort &amp; Splendour, than what there was to be ſeen in the <hi>Rough Skins</hi> with which they hardly covered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and who had <hi>Houſes full of Good Things,</hi> vaſtly out-ſhining their ſqualid and dark <hi>Wigwams;</hi> And they ſaw this People
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002246_0032_0FDAD80B6300B568"/>Repleniſhing their <hi>Fields,</hi> with <hi>Trees</hi> and with <hi>Grains,</hi> and uſeful <hi>Animals,</hi> which until now they had been wholly Strangers to; yet they did not ſeem touch'd in the leaſt, with any <hi>Ambition</hi> to come at ſuch Deſireable Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, or with any <hi>Curioſity</hi> to enquire after the <hi>Religion</hi> that was attended with them. To <hi>Humanize</hi> theſe Miſerable <hi>Animals,</hi> and in any meaſure to <hi>Cicurate</hi> them &amp; <hi>Civilize</hi> them, were a work of no little Difficulty; and a Performance little ſhort of what One of our moſt famous <hi>Phyſicians</hi> eſteemed the <hi>Greateſt Cure</hi> that ever himſelf had wrought in all his Practice; <hi>To bring an Idiot unto the uſe of Reaſon.</hi> But then, to Raiſe theſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerables up, unto an Acquaintance with, and an Experience of, the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and bring them not only to <hi>Know</hi> ſomething of their SAVIOUR, but alſo to <hi>Live unto GOD</hi> by Him; A <hi>Noble Work</hi> This; But every One muſt ſay, No very <hi>Eaſy</hi> One!</p>
               <p>Two Decads of Years, from the Beginning of this Colony, had not rolled away, before an Entrance was made upon this Work of PIETY; And our celebrated ELIOT, having with a <hi>Labour that overcometh all things,</hi> made himſelf the Maſter of a Language, wherein many of the Words are of <hi>Seſquipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalian,</hi> and <hi>Unaccountable</hi> Dimenſions (One
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:002246_0033_0FDAD8460197CE70"/>of the words, I know, that has more than Fifty Letters in it,) he Viſited the Villages of theſe <hi>Indians,</hi> and with a very diſcrete Management Preached the <hi>Word of Truth, and the Goſpel of their Salvation,</hi> in their own Language unto them. This Memorable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of GOD, was no ſooner at work, but in ſome other Parts of the Country, the <hi>Harveſt</hi> had ſome other Labourers appearing in it, who <hi>did vertuouſly;</hi> but no One is <hi>wronged,</hi> if it be confeſſed, that our ELIOT ſhone as <hi>the Moon among the Leſſer Stars,</hi> and <hi>Excelled them all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Good Man</hi> had the <hi>Hand of the Lord</hi> with him; &amp; his Evangelical Attempts were ſo bleſſed of GOD, that anon (beyond what any <hi>Xavier</hi> could pretend unto!) <hi>Churches</hi> were formed among theſe <hi>Indians,</hi> and in an <hi>Holy Covenant</hi> they <hi>gave themſelves unto the LORD, and then unto one another,</hi> Engaging to Live in the Service of GOD, and carry on together the Worſhip of our SAVIOUR, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Directions of the Goſpel. This was done, after <hi>Synods</hi> of <hi>Engliſh Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> had ſeen <hi>Strict Examinations</hi> paſſed upon their Improvements in <hi>Experimental Piety,</hi> as well as their <hi>Knowledge in the Myſtery of CHRIST.</hi> And an Eminent Perſon preſent at theſe <hi>Examinations,</hi> did then Publiſh to
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:002246_0034_0FDAC94A6461C050"/>the World this Teſtimony concerning it. His words were theſe; <q>There is ſo much of <hi>GOD's Work,</hi> as that I cannot but count it a <hi>Great Evil,</hi> Yea, a Great Injury to GOD and His Goodneſs, for any to make light of it. To ſee and hear <hi>Indians,</hi> opening their Mouths, and lifting up their Hands &amp; Eyes in <hi>Prayer</hi> to the Living GOD, calling on Him by His Name JEHOVAH, in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of JESUS CHRIST, and this for a good while together; to ſee and hear them <hi>Exhorting</hi> one another from the Word of GOD; to ſee and hear them <hi>Confeſſing</hi> the Name of CHRIST JESUS, and their own Sinfulneſs! Sure, this is more than uſual! — We that were preſent that day, ſaw and heard them perform the Duties menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, with ſuch Grave and Sober Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, with ſuch Comely Reverence, in their Geſture, and whole Carriage, and with ſuch Plenty of <hi>Tears,</hi> as did argue to us, that they ſpake with the Holy Fear of GOD, and it much affected our Hearts.</q>
               </p>
               <p>BUT then, the Early Care of SCHOOLS, having brought theſe Uncultivated <hi>Salvages</hi> unto the skill of <hi>Reading</hi> and <hi>Writing,</hi> this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable <hi>Doer of the Work of</hi> an EVANGELIST, with an immenſe [ANAGR.] <hi>Toile,</hi> produced a <hi>Library of

               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Great Light</hi> had ſeveral <hi>Satellits</hi> wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on it; <hi>Primers,</hi> and <hi>Grammars,</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſms,</hi> and <hi>The Practice of Piety,</hi> and, our BAXTERS <hi>Call to the Unconverted,</hi> and ſome other Compoſures.

               <p>It was an odd Ceremony and Superſtition in ſome ancient <hi>Baptiſms,</hi> that when they <hi>Renounced Satan,</hi> they turned their Faces to the <hi>Weſt,</hi> where the Sun ſets in <hi>Darkneſs;</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="unknown:002246_0036_0FDAD80E0D787898"/>But Profeſſing their Faith in our SAVIOUR, they turned their Faces to the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> where <hi>Light</hi> ariſes.

               <p>AND now, tho' ELIOT, and thoſe that follow'd him, in the <hi>Firſt Eſſays,</hi> to bring the <hi>Light</hi> unto the Nations, that were doomed unto <hi>Outward Darkneſs,</hi> be Dead, yet there has been a Succeſſion of worthy Engliſhmen, who have <hi>gone on</hi> with the Eſſays; And there are <hi>Indians</hi> alſo, who are conſtant Preachers of the Goſpel unto their Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; ſo that the <hi>Good Work</hi> having <hi>Obtained Help from GOD,</hi> and having triumphed over the Plots of Ill-affected Men to divert from it the <hi>European</hi> Waters that nouriſh it, it <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to this Day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Work is <hi>Glorious:</hi> But a Principal <hi>Glory</hi> of it, has been the <hi>Purity</hi> of the CHRISTIANITY, which has been brought unto theſe <hi>Indians,</hi> in our Attempts to <hi>Chriſtianize</hi> them. The RELIGION wherein they have been inſtructed, has not been the <hi>Religion of a Party;</hi> but the <hi>Pure Religion and Undefiled,</hi> which is evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the <hi>Sacred Scriptures.</hi> The <hi>Main
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:002246_0037_0FDAD848ABC9BF50"/>Things,</hi> which the Inſtructions given to them have inſiſted on, have not been, either the Things which <hi>Good Men</hi> may be and have been <hi>Divided</hi> in, or the <hi>Obſervations</hi> wherein the <hi>Wickedeſt</hi> Men may act their Part as fairly as the <hi>Holieſt,</hi> and with which the <hi>Kingdom of GOD cometh not.</hi> But the Pure MAXIMS of the <hi>Everlaſting Goſpel</hi> are thoſe that have been inſtilled into them; Even thoſe which All <hi>Good Men</hi> are <hi>United</hi> in, and which GOD will keep the <hi>Nations in Diſtreſs and Great Perplexity,</hi> until He has compelled His Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to <hi>Unite</hi> upon. What they have been taught, has been, To <hi>Worſhip GOD in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and <hi>Rejoyce in CHRIST JESUS,</hi> and <hi>Love one another,</hi> and ſhun every thing which the <hi>Light of GOD</hi> in their Souls may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn as an <hi>Evil Thing.</hi> If the Direction gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them has been, To Study their own <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> and acquaint themſelves with the <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> of GOD, and make their <hi>own Prayers</hi> with the Aſſiſtances of His Holy SPIRIT; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to cramp their Devotions with a <hi>Liturgy:</hi> To be content with ſuch <hi>Officers,</hi> and Managemen's of the Offices, in their Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as they find in the <hi>Word of CHRIST</hi> an unqueſtionable Inſtitution for: To <hi>Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize</hi> on the LORDS-DAY, and know no other <hi>Stated Holidays</hi> of Religion; but yet keep

               <p>There were no leſs than <hi>Thirty Nations</hi> of <hi>Indians,</hi> which occupied the Land, that is now covered by the <hi>New-Engliſh</hi> Colonies. A Great Part of theſe Contemptuouſly and Obſtinately Rejected the Repeated Offers of the Goſpel, which our <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> made unto

               </p>
               <p>BUT then, I muſt proceed, in the ſecond place, humbly to <hi>Confeſs</hi> and <hi>Bewail,</hi> the <hi>Clouds</hi> which we ſee this <hi>Good Work</hi> encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred withal, and beſpeak the Tears of a <hi>Bochim</hi> from us.</p>
               <p>It is true, The laſt Account which we took not very long ago, informed us, That at <hi>Marthas-Vineyard,</hi> and the little Adjacent-Iſland, there were <hi>Ten little Congregations,</hi> wherein our Great SAVIOUR is Worſhipped; and which have <hi>Two Engliſh-men,</hi> and <hi>Ten Indians,</hi> that in their own Language do Preach
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:002246_0041_0FDAD855829A6D78"/>unto them. At <hi>Nantucket,</hi> there were <hi>Three Cengregations,</hi> and as many Preachers. On the Continent, there were between Twenty and Thirty Congregations of <hi>Chriſtianized Indians,</hi> whereto there belong ſome Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Souls. Theſe had then Ten <hi>Engliſh Preachers,</hi> who gave them their Inſtructions and Aſſiſtances; and between Twenty and Thirty <hi>Indian Teachers,</hi> by whom the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of the <hi>Lords Days</hi> are moſtly managed. Some of theſe Congregations, are not yet advanced unto all the Privileges of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Church-State.</hi> But a conſiderable Number are ſo; and ſome <hi>New Churches</hi> were lately formed among them. I ſuppoſe, Things are not very much altered, from what they were in this Account, which the laſt <hi>Viſitation</hi> brought unto us. Very many Engliſh Witneſſes have been much affected with the Devotion, that they have ſeen ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by theſe <hi>Indians</hi> in their Publick Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of Religion; their <hi>Prayers</hi> formed with much of pertinency, and uttered with as much ſolemnity; their <hi>Sermons,</hi> of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Divinity, at the Hearing whereof, Children ſcarce a dozen Years old, readily turn to the Proofs; their <hi>Pſalmody,</hi> in which they out-do ſome of our <hi>Engliſh Aſſemblies;</hi> and the <hi>Admonitions &amp; Excommunications,</hi> with
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:002246_0042_0FDAD8160F34E9F0"/>which they Cenſure Scandalous Offenders. One that is at this time a Worthy Engliſh Miniſter, but a Preacher to the <hi>Indians</hi> in their own Language alſo, has given in unto us, this Teſtimony. <q>Their Gravity, and diligent Attendance in the Time of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; with the Affectionate Confeſſions of ſuch as are admitted into the Church; make me hope, that many of them may have the Work of the <hi>Spirit</hi> wrought in them, <hi>according to the working of the Mighty Power of GOD.</hi> Their Method, reſpecting thoſe that are admitted into their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, is more according to the manner of the Churches in the Primitive Times, than is now practiſed in moſt parts. The Perſon to be Admitted, ſtands forth in the midſt of the Aſſembly; and firſt makes a <hi>Declaration</hi> of his <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and ſometimes deſires <hi>Information</hi> in things moſt arduous and doubtful. And then he makes a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Sin;</hi> which they do, (as I have ſeen,) with <hi>Tears</hi> and <hi>Trembling,</hi> like him in the <hi>Sixteenth</hi> Chapter of the <hi>Acts.</hi> And then he gives an Account of <hi>Experiences</hi> he has had, of Convictions, Awakenings and Comforts; in which they are large and particular. After which (much Counſel and Exhortation to remain ſtedfaſt in the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:002246_0043_0FDAD85AA948C578"/>
                     <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Ways</hi> of the Lord, being given them by their <hi>Paſtor</hi> and <hi>Elder,</hi>) they are Admitted. I would, (and not ungrounded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) hope, That <hi>Additions are made unto the Church daily of ſuch as ſhall be ſaved.</hi> There are many, which maintain a Chriſtian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and are to be accounted, not <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,</hi> but <hi>Altogether Chriſtians.</hi> And this does encourage the Preaching of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> to them; when we ſee, it pleaſes GOD to make it, <hi>His Power unto Salvation.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding all of this, we muſt humbly ſay, <hi>'Tis a Day of Small things.</hi> The <hi>Indians</hi> are not yet improved ſo far into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Civility, and Induſtry, and Husbandry, as were to be deſired, and as a due Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> would oblige them to. Many of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> inſtead of giving them Aſſiſtences and Encouragements, have rather contrived <hi>Indirect Ways</hi> to keep them under, and Entangle them in <hi>Debts</hi> unto them; and Vile Things have been done upon their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvencies, Religion,</hi> 'tis to be fear'd, is under a Decay among them: Their <hi>Good Order</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing: And the older and wiſer <hi>Indians</hi> going off, and Engliſh Neighbours too often hurting of the Survivors, much of that little <hi>Glory</hi> in which has been among them, ſeems to have an <hi>Ichabod</hi> written upon it.</p>

But what has of all things the moſt Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Aſpect upon them, is, The love of <hi>Strong Drink,</hi> which ſtrangely Captivates the <hi>Indians;</hi> inſomuch that <hi>very few</hi> are found A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wholly to reſiſt and conquer the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when 'tis laid before them; and which, notwithſtanding the Prohibitions of the <hi>Law,</hi> finds ways of coming at them, that ſeem al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Incurable; and which, where it has its operation, does confound all Religion, and every Valuable Intereſt. <hi>Rhum;</hi> That <hi>Branch</hi> of the <hi>River of Death;</hi> Alas, it threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens, more than any thing elſe, that we can think upon, to drown the <hi>Good Work,</hi> for which we are this day Signalizing our Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude. <hi>Men of Iſrael, Help!</hi> What, what ſhall be done for the Help, of a Miſchief, ſo formidable, ſo deplorable!</p>
               <p>THIS is what I am in the Third Place arriv'd unto.

               </p>
               <p>I am not inſenſible, that there are clamours now and then made as if your Small <hi>Revenue,</hi>

<pb n="43" facs="unknown:002246_0046_0FDAD817128AFE78"/>of a <hi>Good Work,</hi> which the <hi>Powers of Darkneſs</hi> will do all they can, to Encumber with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, that will require an uncommon <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> to Encounter them. The <hi>Ocean</hi> over which our Predeceſſors paſſed hither, was by Antiquity revered as leading to <hi>Holy and Bleſſed Seats,</hi> and ſomething of a <hi>more than Humane</hi> Character. Let us <hi>Do the Beſt we can,</hi> that it may be ſo; and if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not raiſe our <hi>Indians</hi> up unto all the <hi>More than common</hi> Goodneſs that we are Striving for, yet let us come to it <hi>Our ſelves,</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in our Doing our Beſt for <hi>Them,</hi> that they may do ſo. And whereas a Main In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention which you now have in your View, is, To bring the Riſing Generation of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> unto a more general Underſtanding of the <hi>Engliſh Language,</hi> and more into the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh way of Living,</hi> You will employ your fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and earneſt <hi>Conſultations</hi> upon it, and Call in the Advice of as many others, as may offer any <hi>Proper Methods,</hi> for the more Effectual Proſecution of it.</p>
               <p>But as a Teſtimony of your <hi>Zeal</hi> for this <hi>Good Work,</hi> and of the Senſe which you have, that without the Influences of GOD our SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR we <hi>can do Nothing</hi> to purpoſe, You are this Day pouring out your <hi>Prayers</hi> before Him. Theſe <hi>Prayers</hi> are doubtleſs a <hi>Token
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:002246_0047_0FDAD8642230E248"/>for Good,</hi> that there may be ſome <hi>Reſerves of Mercy,</hi> for a Remnant of the moſt Pitiable Ones, on whoſe behalf we are now concerned. If but a <hi>Few</hi> of them, ſhould be brought into a Sincere <hi>Love</hi> of GOD and of their <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> and a Living <hi>Faith</hi> on our only SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR, it will be richly worth all the Time and Coſt that has been laid out upon them all. And the Acknowledgments which we now make of our Entire Dependence on the <hi>GOD of all Grace</hi> for all the Good that is to be done among them and unto them, are the moſt likely way for our coming to ſee that <hi>Sweet</hi> Thing, Our <hi>Deſire accompliſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While our Supplications to <hi>OUR Father</hi> are thus Engaged, we ſhall Remember our dear Brethren, of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Miſſion as far off as <hi>Malabar;</hi> the <hi>Good News</hi> of whoſe amiable Enterprizes have been as <hi>cool waters to our Thirſty Souls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will recite a paſſage in One of their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, becauſe we may make an Application of it unto our own Affair. <q>Whenever the <hi>Sun</hi> riſeth in theſe Eaſtern Parts of the World, it is always Surrounded with <hi>Thick Glouds;</hi> the common People of the <hi>Malabarians</hi> tell us, that theſe <hi>Clouds</hi> are huge overgrown <hi>Giants,</hi> thro' which the <hi>Sun</hi> every Morning muſt fight his way, before ever it can appear
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:002246_0048_0FDAD81FCB180EB0"/>in its Compleat Luſtre, and Brightneſs. This is a Fancy of the Vulgar Sort of our <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians;</hi> But the Application we might make of it, will hold too True in every Reſpect, The <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs</hi> would fain begin to Riſe, in theſe benighted parts of the World: But what Oppoſition, what Contradiction, does this <hi>Sun</hi> meet with; even from thoſe who ſhould help to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the <hi>Clouds</hi> and obſtacles, which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto have intercepted His <hi>Light</hi> and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and this too, whilſt this <hi>Light</hi> but juſt begins to break forth, and to appear in its firſt Dawn and Morning Red? How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, 'tis to be hoped, that the <hi>Light</hi> will triumph at laſt over the <hi>Powers of Darkneſs,</hi> and ſpread its Rays over all the Regions of Heatheniſm and Superſtition.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Excellent Things</hi> are done by thoſe Rare Men, in <hi>Laying a Foundation of True Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> among the <hi>Orientals,</hi> for the next Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to build upon, and Propagate a <hi>Religion</hi> which is not a meer <hi>External Thing</hi> that may render the Proſelytes to it no better than <hi>Tinkling Cymbals,</hi> but that which ſets up the <hi>Kingdom of GOD</hi> in the SOUL, and aboliſhes the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>Satan,</hi> and introduces the <hi>Image</hi> of our SAVIOUR, there. This inexpreſſibly
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:002246_0049_0FDAD865D7FBEC50"/>Endears thoſe our Brethren unto us, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends them to our <hi>Prayers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With ſo ſaying, I will add, That I would, if I had Opportunity, beſpeak the <hi>Prayers</hi> of the Faithful abroad in the World, for <hi>our own Affair,</hi> in ſuch Terms, as are uſed for <hi>Theirs,</hi> by the College of Great Men, whom the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> has lately Incorporated, for the <hi>Propagation of the Goſpel in the</hi> Eaſt-Indies; and who on the occaſion thereof are alſo doing ſome New Things to <hi>Chriſtianize</hi> their own <hi>Finlanders.</hi> The words uſed by theſe Great Men, in the Inſtrument lately Publiſhed by them, are ſuch, as I would if I could addreſs very many People with. Say they, <q>
                     <hi>Private Perſens,</hi> who make Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of daily addreſſing their Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Secret, are Entreated to Remember this work, as a proper Subject in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Supplications.</hi> The more fervent they are in their Addreſſes to GOD, the greater we truſt will be the Bleſſings of Almighty GOD upon the whole Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed, I deſpair of any very Great Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be done, for the Spreading of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, thro' the World, until the <hi>Iſraelitiſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> be Returned unto their Land, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted unto their GOD. The <hi>Camp</hi> in the
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:002246_0050_0FDAD8BB84281E10"/>Wilderneſs cannot get much forward, until the Leproſy of <hi>Miriam</hi> ſhall be taken off, and the Rejected Lady be Reſtored. Our Prayers for that Happy Revolution ought mightily to be Excited and Enlarged. But yet, Let us be doing what we can!</p>
               <p>And, Oh! if our <hi>Prayers</hi> may have any ſhare, in obtaining a <hi>Zeal of the Lord of Hoſts</hi> to be Enkindled in more of His People, for the Propagating of a <hi>Religion</hi> which Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies Him, and Recovers Mankind unto Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty! <hi>Then</hi> ſhould we ſee, another face on the corners of <hi>England,</hi> the Highlands of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the boggy Receſſes of <hi>Ireland,</hi> than there is yet appearing. <hi>Then</hi> ſhould we ſee the <hi>Africans</hi> no longer ſo treated like meer <hi>Beaſts of Burden,</hi> as they are in the Plantations of cruel <hi>Americans:</hi> And the Great Revenues left unto the Charitable Deſign of <hi>Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing</hi> the <hi>Negro's,</hi> would have ſome Good Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count given of them. <hi>Then</hi> ſhould we ſee the Noble <hi>Eſſays to Save a Loſt World,</hi> carried as far as the Hunger of <hi>Trade,</hi> now makes Men run thro' <hi>Sea</hi> and <hi>Land,</hi> even to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi> And <hi>Madagaſcar</hi> it ſelf, where ſome think they ſee <hi>Fields ripe for the Harveſt,</hi> would not be left unviſited. But above all, <hi>Then</hi> ſhould we ſee the <hi>Veil</hi> taken off the
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:002246_0051_0FDAD8674B0BA6E8"/>Minds of the <hi>Jewiſh Nation,</hi> and GOD would <hi>Shew wonders to the Dead,</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> would <hi>walk in the Light</hi> of the <hi>New Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Yea, who can tell, but the Holy SPIRIT promiſed upon the <hi>Asking</hi> for it, would make ſuch a Deſcent, as to <hi>do Wondrouſly,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Arm of the Lord</hi> would be <hi>made bare in the Eyes of all the Nations,</hi> and <hi>all the Ends of the Earth, ſhould ſee the Salvation of our GOD;</hi> and the <hi>Dove</hi> would ſo Return to us as to Tarry with us, and the <hi>Flood</hi> of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Wickedneſs, wherein the Earth is now over-whelmed, ſhall be carried away.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>There are certain Methods of PIETY directed by our SAVIOUR, that ſo a Juſt GOD, offended by our Sins, may be <hi>Reconciled</hi> unto us, and that ſo we may be <hi>Qualified</hi> for the Enjoyment of GOD in that <hi>Holineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi>

There are certain Points of the <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Goſpel,</hi> according to which, it muſt be <hi>with a loud Voice</hi> proclaimed unto us, That we muſt ſo <hi>Fear GOD, and give Glory unto Him;</hi> and Except the <hi>Kingdom of GOD,</hi> be therewithal firſt ſet up in us, we cannot be Received into His <hi>Heavenly Kingdom.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond is this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A Glorious CHRIST, who is the Eternal Son of GOD, Incarnate and Enthroned in our Bleſſed JESUS, is the Redeemer of Mankind;

unto whoſe Great Sacrifice I muſt repair for Acceptance with GOD; And under His Conduct, I am to Expect a Compleat Happineſs for my Immortal Soul, to which He will Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore my Body, when He ſhall come to Judge the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Third is this;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Out of Reſpect unto GOD and His CHRIST, I muſt heartily Love my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and for ever do unto other Men, as I muſt own it Reaſonable for them to do unto me.</hi>

               <p>In the Latter End of the Year, 1714. the Illuſtrious Dr. <hi>Franckius,</hi> did me the Honour of writing to me, from <hi>Hall</hi> in the Lower <hi>Saxony,</hi> a very large Letter, which has been ſince Tranſlated and Publiſhed (by that <hi>Man of an Excellent Spirit,</hi> Mr. <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>705. Two Young Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates of Divinity, <hi>Bartholomew Ziegenbalgh,</hi> and <hi>Henry Plutſcho,</hi> Natives of <hi>Germany,</hi> were ſent by <hi>Frederick</hi> IV. the preſent King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> to attempt the Converſion of the <hi>Malabar</hi>-Heathens there. They arrived ſafely at <hi>Tranquebar,</hi> in the Month of <hi>June,</hi> 1706. and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately applied themſelves to Learn the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe</hi> and <hi>Malabar</hi> Tongues. The Latter of theſe Languages, tho' exceeding Hard and Intricate, was, within Eight Months time, ſo far Maſtered by Mr. <hi>Ziegenbalgh,</hi> that he began to Preach to the <hi>Malabar</hi> Heathen in it, and by this Means, to Explain unto them the <hi>Method of Salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Effect, GOD left not their Endeavours without a Bleſſing: For ſoon after, ſome of theſe Heathens being wrought upon by the Word of Salvation, did ſhake off their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Idolatry, and readily came over to Chriſtianity. And this hopeful Beginning proved a New Encouragement unto theſe
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:002246_0065_0FDAD8824C9E0AA0"/>Labourers, to go on with the work ſo happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet on foot, tho' not without Toil and Difficulty. However, after a Little while, they found ſo many <hi>Lets</hi> and <hi>Impediments</hi> in their way, raiſed by Heathens &amp; Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as ſeemed to break the very firſt Efforts tending to the Converſion of the Heathen, to the Church of CHRIST.</p>
                  <p>The Pagans were generally poſſeſſed with an utter Averſion to the Chriſtian Religion; and this for no other Reaſon, but becauſe they ſaw ſo much Impiety and Profaneneſs abounding among thoſe that Call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by This Name. This was attended with many Conſequences. For no ſooner did an Heathen Embrace the Chriſtian Faith, but he was for ever baniſhed from all his former Goods and Poſſeſſions, and left to the wide World, to ſhift for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. However, there were ſome other Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments thrown in their way, far more Obſtructive to the Propagation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, than all what the Heathens could do to Oppoſe it. Thoſe Impediments were ſtarted on the part of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whoſe Duty it had been to aid and ſupport ſo laudable an Undertaking.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="unknown:002246_0066_0FDAD8D3629A6600"/>
But in the midſt of theſe Various obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, raiſed Originally by the Common E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy of Souls, GOD was pleaſed to Excite many perſons in <hi>Germany,</hi> to favour the Labours of the Miſſionaries; Eſpecially after they were Convinced, with what Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and Diligence they endeavoured to manage the work Committed unto their Truſt. And truly, Conſiderable Sums of Money were required, for Settling and improving, the ſeveral Branches of this Conſtitution. It was neceſſary, that a Church ſhould be built, and Charity-Schools ſhould be ſet up, and all manner of <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian</hi> and Chriſtian Books tranſcribed, for the Improvement of the whole Deſign.</p>
                  <p>About the Latter End of the Year, 1708, when the work increaſed under their hands, Three Perſons more, were ſent over on the ſame Errand. — They were ſupplied with a Printing-Preſs, a Font of Latin Types, and other Neceſſaries, at the Expence of the Engliſh Nation; the whole being accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a preſent of Fifty Pounds in Money, for carrying on the better the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in hand. — And we in <hi>Germany</hi> did what we could, to prepare a Font of <hi>

                  <p>THat <hi>Evangelical</hi> and indeed <hi>Angelical</hi> work, in which (<hi>Reverend Sirs,</hi> You and your Collegues) We with a Joyful &amp; Grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Mind, ſee you Engaged with ſuch a toyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Labour; 'Tis truly, the moſt Noble of all that are or ever can be undertaken among the Children of Men. Than this moſt <hi>Holy Work,</hi> there can be Invented, Nothing more Heavenly, Nothing more Gracious, Nothing more Agreeable &amp; Subſervient unto the Firſt and Main End, and Chief Good, of Men; There can be nothing more Profitable to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; or more worthy of Emulation even among the very <hi>Angels</hi> of GOD.</p>
                  <p>It is a GOD full of Mercy, for ever darting out the Beams of His Love to Mankind, who has firſt Excited you, and thereupon Aſſiſted you, for the <hi>Propagation</hi> of His <hi>Religion</hi>
                     <pb n="63" facs="unknown:002246_0072_0FDAD8E1B9ECF6D8"/>which wherever it is Preach'd &amp; own'd, it fetches out of the Grave, a World buried in its truly Miſerable Corruption and Perdition, and Reſtores it unto that Life Eternal, which we have loſt by the Apoſtaſy of our Firſt Parents, and our own.</p>
                  <p>'Tis the <hi>Religion</hi> which brings the choſen of GOD into the Bleſſedneſs unto which He has Choſen them; and opens &amp; ſets up the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of GOD among the Nations. 'Tis the <hi>Religion</hi> that brings in Faithful Subjects and Souldiers for the Lord of Hoſts, and builds up <hi>Living Tempels</hi> for GOD, which are far more precious than any that are but Artificial and Inanimate. This <hi>Religion</hi> it is, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites and fetches down <hi>Heaven</hi> to the <hi>Earth,</hi> and prepares the Inhabitants of the <hi>Earth</hi> to be received into the moſt Bleſſed Manſions of <hi>Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Work, How Illuſtrious! How Celeſtial! How Sublime! Oh! Thrice and four times Happy they, who are Miniſters of GOD in ſuch a Work! Happy, tho' never ſo much haraſs'd with Labours, and Watchings, and Perpetual Troubles! <hi>Happy beyond all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, did they but know their own Happineſs!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Miniſtry, Suppoſe it a Load which even the <hi>Backs of Angels</hi> may tremble at; yet it is a work, which the <hi>Wings of Angels</hi> would
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:002246_0074_0FDAD8E8C16DB900"/>be with the higheſt Flights and Joys applied unto: Yea, and a work, in which the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters who Execute the Pleaſure &amp; Command of GOD, with Eſſays to have <hi>His Kingdom ruling over all;</hi> Theſe not only are a ſort of Competitors with the <hi>Angels,</hi> but alſo in theſe Eſſays Enjoy them for their Companions and Coadjutors.</p>
                  <p>Great and Grievous and never enough to be bewailed, has been the Scandal given in the Churches of the Reformation; in that ſo very little, yea, next to nothing, has been done in them, for the Propagation of a <hi>Faith,</hi> which breathes nothing but the moſt unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable Wiſdom and Goodneſs; and by which the Kingdom of GOD comes down into a World, which Satan Reigning every where in it, Poſſeſſes and Oppreſſes, with how direful Chains of his upon it! While at the ſame time, the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſtrives with an Unwearied and Extravagant Labour, to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate the Idolatry and Superſtition of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> and advance the Empire of Satan. And the Miſſionaries and Brokers of that Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, are indeed more than can be numbred. The Zeal of thoſe Panders, how Ardent is it! Their Attempts, how never tired! Their Travels how very tedious! And with what an Ardour are they Ambitious of a <hi>Crown,</hi> which appears to them a True Martyrdom, &amp; for the Truth.</p>

                     <pb n="65" facs="unknown:002246_0076_0FDAD8EA17812A88"/>
But Bleſſed be the Name of our GOD, in that He hath inclined the Minds of ſome E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Perſons, to take away ſuch a Scandal, and inſtigated them to roll off this Reproach from us. And among theſe, if any <hi>have done vertuouſly,</hi> You, O <hi>Malabcrian</hi> Miſſionaries, (which I would Speak, not for the Flattering of you, but as Admiring the Divine Grace which has aſſiſted you!) <hi>You have excelled them all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Report of your Miſſion and of your Diligence, hath reached from the Eaſtern even to the Weſtern <hi>Indies.</hi> And what the Grace of Heaven has helped you to do, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the producing of a Chriſtian People among the <hi>Indians,</hi> is heard among the <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican</hi> Chriſtians, with the higheſt Praiſes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up to GOD on the occaſion, and <hi>as cool waters to our Thirſty Souls</hi> is the <hi>Good News from a far Country.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Being Invited by your moſt Courteous and Chriſtian Letters to me, and being a moſt hearty well-wiſher to your Enterprizes for the Enlargement of the Church, I am willing to declare, in a few words, and with the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty which becomes me, what my Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions are concerning the <hi>Glorious</hi> and <hi>Weighty</hi> Affair which you have upon your hands.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="unknown:002246_0078_0FDAD8EB538F8D98"/>
And in the <hi>Firſt</hi> Place, this is the very <hi>Firſt born</hi> of my Wiſhes; nor is there any thing that I more wiſh, or have more Earneſt deſires for, than this: That all the Servants of GOD, who <hi>Do and Endure</hi> many Things for the <hi>Evangelizing</hi> of the World may Exhibit unto the whole World the <hi>Pure Maxims</hi> of the <hi>Everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> and would Preach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Nations, the <hi>Weightier Matters of the Goſpel,</hi> and the <hi>Wheat</hi> well cleanſed from the <hi>Chaff,</hi> and from thoſe <hi>Leſſer Matters,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about Good Men, may and often do, carry on their Diſputations.</p>
                  <p>'Tis moſt certain, That the <hi>Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> is no other than the Doctrine of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to GOD by CHRIST; and is a <hi>Practical Thing</hi> rather than a meer <hi>Theory;</hi> the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof is, to animate a Real, Solid, Vital PIETY, and Call forth ſuch as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>'Tis moſt certain, That in the <hi>Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> which is indeed a Doctrine of PIETY, there are ſundry <hi>Practical Articles,</hi> in which all the <hi>Children of GOD</hi> are United; and they who ſeriouſly and ſincerely Coaleſce in this <hi>Union</hi> are to be reckoned among the <hi>Children of GOD.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is very certain, That theſe few Articles of <hi>Practical Piety,</hi> being firſt offered and well
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:002246_0080_0FDAD8F171A847C0"/>Received, the <hi>Mind</hi> thus <hi>Healed,</hi> will now make a Righter and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>This therefore is the One Thing, which I earneſtly Requeſt of you; That you firſt of all propound unto the Nations among whom you <hi>abound in the work of the Lord,</hi> theſe <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Firſt Magnitude,</hi> wherein <hi>True Chriſtianity</hi> does Firſtly and Chiefly conſiſt.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Firſt</hi> Place; The One GOD, who Subſiſteth in <hi>Three Perſons,</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Spirit;</hi> and who in the Beginning did <hi>Create</hi> the World; is to be Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced and Adored for OUR GOD. It muſt be the <hi>Principal Aim</hi> of our Life, in all things to yield <hi>Obedience</hi> unto Him. And it muſt be our moſt hearty Care, to Avoid every Thing which His Light ſhining in our Soul ſhall condemn as an Evil Thing.</p>
                  <p>In the Next Place; The CHRIST, who is the Eternal SON of GOD Incarnate in our Bleſſed JESUS, is our only <hi>Redeemer;</hi> who Dying for us, has offered a moſt Acceptable

                     <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to the Divine Juſtice, on which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying by <hi>Faith</hi> we become Reconciled unto GOD; and under the Conduct of Him who being received up into the Heavens, now Reigns on the Throne of GOD, we are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a wonderful and unſpeakable Bleſſedneſs for our <hi>Immortal Soul,</hi> whereto our <hi>Body</hi> ſhall be Re-united in a Glorious <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> when He ſhall <hi>Return</hi> unto us to <hi>Judge the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly; Being filled with the Love of GOD and of CHRIST, we muſt moſt Heartily Love our <hi>Neighbours;</hi> and for ever go by that Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Rule, <hi>Whatſoever you would have Men do unto you, do you even the ſame unto them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THIS is that PURE CHRISTIANITY, which when it ſhall be by the Trumpets of GOD purely and plainly Preached unto the Nations, the Preachers will doubtleſs have GOD ſmiling upon them; <hi>The Hand of the Lord will be with them; and many will Believe, and be turned unto the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, <hi>The Hand of the Lord!</hi> What is it, but that SPIRIT of GOD, without whoſe Aids, they that would <hi>Build the Houſe of the Lord,</hi> will but <hi>Labour in Vain?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis indeed with a very Trembling Heart, and not without the moſt profound Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that I would now hint a matter to you,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:002246_0084_0FDAD8F81017FEC0"/>or at leaſt inſinuate it with a whiſper hardly to be uttered. Some eminently Learned Men, Perſons of the moſt finiſhed Erudition, and the fartheſt in the World from all Fanaticiſm, are of this Perſwaſion; That the <hi>Reformation</hi> and <hi>Propagation</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> will be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, by Granting over again, thoſe <hi>Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Gifts of the Prophetic Spirit,</hi> by which the Holy Spirit watered the Primitive Church, and at firſt ſpread and confirmed the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> in the World.</p>
                  <p>The moſt Holy SPIRIT of GOD has uſed this Method from the very beginning of the World; that ſo He might communicate the Light, with which He would lead His People travelling on the <hi>Earth,</hi> to the <hi>Reſt</hi> which the Saints have in the Heavens reſerved for them. It hath ſeemed Good unto Him, to ſend down from on High, into the Children of Men, thoſe <hi>Good Angels,</hi> who have always been the moſt proper and ready Inſtruments of the <hi>Eternal Spirit</hi> for ſuch a Purpoſe; and the Favourites of GOD, who have been ſo managed and inſpired by <hi>Angels,</hi> have been the Meſſengers and Proclaimers, by whom He has revealed His Will both in Word and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, to the Children of Men.

                     </gap> Wondrous have been the Operations of the <hi>Angels</hi> in theſe Miniſters of GOD; but <hi>all

                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Angelical</hi> Poſſeſſion and <hi>Energy</hi> of the <hi>Prophetic Spirit,</hi> has ever been to the People of GOD as a <hi>Light ſhining in a dark place;</hi> A Place, alas, how <hi>Dark,</hi> how buried in <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> would it have been, if it had not been allowed unto this our World; for to Rejoyce in the Conſolation of ſuch a Light! The Immenſe <hi>Treaſures of Truth,</hi> which we have treaſured up for us in the Sacred Scriptures, we confeſs to be owing unto this <hi>Prophetic Spirit;</hi> yea, 'tis owing to the Afflations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that the Church is continued againſt all the Hazards and Horrors of Extinction, tho' it be like a little ſpark in the midſt of a Tempeſtuous Ocean.</p>
                  <p>For Four Hundred Years before the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our SAVIOUR, there was a Cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and Silence of this <hi>Prophetic Spirit.</hi> But when that Great KING Aſcending on High, <hi>Sat down on the Right Hand of the moſt High GOD,</hi> He received <hi>Gifts,</hi> which He gave unto Men, and He ſent down into the <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> the <hi>Angels,</hi> who were all <hi>made Subject</hi> unto Him; and He Diſtilled a moſt <hi>Plentiful Shower</hi> of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Gifts, with which He <hi>Refreſhed His weary Heritage.</hi>

That this affair, tho' it be yet ſtruggling in its Infancy, ſhould nevertheleſs excite in you, moſt Reverend Sir, upon your hearing of what GOD is doing here, ſo much of Joy, and of Delight, and of Good Will, We cannot but render our Greateſt Thanks unto GOD, who has been pleaſed to give us the Friendſhip of ſuch a Man; Yea and that beſides you, there ſhould be others of the like Mind and Heart with you, whoſe Piety diſpoſes them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with us, in ſuch Beginnings as are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways attended with ſome Grievous Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and more than this, with their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Counſils Labour to open a more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and eaſy way for the Progreſs of the work which the preſent Miſſion is concerned for.</p>

The Lord of the Harveſt has called him away from the Labour of a Miſſion heavy &amp; weighty enough; has diſmiſſed him, has accepted him; has introduced him into, and begun to refreſh him with, Eternal Conſolations. And now ſince 'tis ſo, what remains as my Duty, is with your Leave, to impart unto you ſuch things as theſe at the preſent, by way of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to your Letters to Mr. <hi>Ziegenbalgh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That Man of Bleſſed Memory is much wanted in the Work of this Miſſion.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For his ſingular Diligence and Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, with which he governed this Work of the Miſſion.</p>
                  <p>Then, For the moſt frequent Conferences, which he maintained with the People, upon Salvation to be expected from CHRIST alone.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, For the Tranſlation of the Word of GOD into the <hi>Damulick</hi> Tongue of this People; — For indeed in all theſe things, the Lord adorned him very much with the Gifts as well of Nature as of Grace, for the ſingular Service of gathering a Church unto Him.</p>
                  <p>As a Remembrance of this Worthy Man, and as a Teſtimony to the Truth of what I ſay, <hi>Sir,</hi> I here preſent you with the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> in the <hi>Damulick</hi> Tongue; together
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:002246_0102_0FDAC951D76BE538"/>with ſome little Books written concerning True Chriſtianity; all which you will take in good part; and I pray you kindly to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept them as a ſmall preſent from ſuch as would render you very great Thanks for the Books which were ſent hither from you.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Preſents of Gold from your young Gentlemen, I have Diſtributed unto the Youth in our Charity Schools. GOD the beſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder, will render to every one according to his Work. And, that GOD would more and more adorn the Souls of theſe Young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen with a Clothing of wrought Gold; This is what is in the Prayers and Hopes of our Youth for them; who alſo render very great Thanks unto their Benefactors.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, While theſe things are doing, and while <hi>Bartholomew Ziegenbalgh</hi> leaves Earth for Heaven, a Merciful GOD has remembred His Work of this Miſſion here in the midſt of all its Troubles. For through His Governing Providence at the ſame time three Candidates for the Miſſion are ſent unto us; who being endued with true Piety, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly ſpend all their Time in Learning the <hi>Damulick</hi> Tongue. And ſo, as ſoon as they have attained a Competent Skill in this <hi>Malabarick</hi> Language, there will be Four of us who are principally employed in the
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:002246_0104_0FDAD90DD5325888"/>Converſion of the Nations, endeavouring to bring them out of Darkneſs into the True Worſhip of GOD. But ſince the Harveſtof the Lord here is Great, and Four Miſſionaries are not enough, we have in this Year made known our Deſires to the Curators of the Miſſion in <hi>Europe,</hi> about ſending over Four Candidates more unto us; making in the mean time our moſt humble Supplication unto our GOD, that He would pleaſe anon to ſend yet more Labourers to us in this His ſo very large an Harvoſt.</p>
                  <p>That Method of proceeding which you have been pleaſed to ſupply us withal, we have Entertained with the higheſt Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; Receiving in it, as a Teſtimony that JESUS CHRIST is Preached among you with all Sincerity; and indeed, which is to us the greateſt pleaſure that can be, in the very ſame Method, that we our ſelves make uſe of here, in treating with Men about the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their Souls; laying aſide thoſe things which are Matters of meer Opinion, and wholly applying our ſelves to This, That CHRIST alone, without any manner of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, may be Propounded and Exhibited. That Method of ours in Propoſing the Doctrine of the Goſpel unto the Nations, does, to tell in ſhort, conſiſt in theſe things.</p>

                     <pb n="80" facs="unknown:002246_0106_0FDAD9180666B3D0"/>
Firſt, We Declare to theſe Heathens, One only True GOD, who has manifeſted Himſelf in Three Perſons: Fairly Noting to them therewithal, what Bleſſings each Perſon has given forth to Men, &amp; will beſtow upon them.</p>
                  <p>Next, We treat of Man, conſidering him according to his Fourfold State; while we ſhow, in how Bleſſed a State he was, while he yet ſhone with the Image of GOD which was Concreated with him: Then, How, or in what way, he loſt that Image of GOD, and put on the Viſage of Satan, and of his own Accord run headlong into wickedneſs.</p>
                  <p>Next, How GOD ſent His moſt Beloved and Only Son into the World, that he might bring us by Repentance out of that Curſed State, unto which every one is by Nature liable, into a State of Grace; that ſo being tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into a State of Grace, we may be willing to have the Image of GOD recovered in our Souls; ſeeking for our Righteouſneſs in CHRIST alone, by Faith, which working by love, we may carefully walk on in a life pure from Vices, and in the daily Exerciſe of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; and grow more and more into the Likeneſs and Reſemblance of our SAVIOUR.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, We Inculcate this, That only they, who in this Life, do by CHRIST, paſs into a State of Grace, with a True Change of Mind
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:002246_0108_0FDAD91907438328"/>upon them, and perſevere in Faith to the End; Theſe only may partake in the Hope of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light; which is our Eternal Bleſſedneſs.</p>
                  <p>We every where keep to this Order of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; ſo that not only in the <hi>Damulick</hi> Tongue, when we ſpeak to the <hi>Damuleans,</hi> but alſo in the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Tongue, when we tender the Word of GOD, unto ſuch as are of a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Original, or to Slaves that have Chriſtian Maſters, yea, or unto <hi>Europeans</hi> in the <hi>High-Dutch</hi> Tongue, we for ever oblige our ſelves in this manner to deliver it. For which cauſe, whatever is done among us, in Preaching, or in Teaching, or in Examining, or in our moſt private Conferences, All ſtill is Entirely Levell'd at this Mark, that we may admoniſh and Excite and quicken Men, unto a True Repentance, unto a Living Faith, unto an Undiſſembled Piety; At the ſame time calling upon GOD with moſt ardent Prayers, that He would thruſt forth ſuch Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries, whoſe chief concern it ſhall be, that the Sheep may be led unto that beſt of Paſtures, which is with JESUS CHRIST, and be refreſhed from none but the pure Fountain of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Daily Experience has hitherto taught us, that by the advantage of <hi>Catechiſts,</hi> we may
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:002246_0110_0FDAD9200C7CA7C0"/>do very much Good, not only upon the Members of the Church themſelves, but alſo upon thoſe that are without. Wherefore upon the Obſervation of This, we do all we can, that by the Word of Truth we may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare ſuch Catechiſts for us, who having a Good Foundation laid in the Knowledge of JESUS CHRIST, may both arrive to a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Experience, and may be made fit from hence to teach others in the Doctrine of JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST, and give them a Lively De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of it. We have Seven ſuch Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſts, with whom we manage, a <hi>Biblical Exerciſe,</hi> an <hi>Exegetical,</hi> and a <hi>Theological.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Biblical</hi> Exerciſe, we take ſome whole Book, of the New Teſtament; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we ſhow them, what Parts are in every Chapter; Afterwards we go thro' the Parts; and the Catechiſts themſelves fetch out from thence, certain Doctrines joyned with ſome Application of them. But when they come to Declare things, they proceed after this manner. Firſt, they Expound the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the Context. Then, This being done, they apply to the proper Edification of the Soul, thoſe things that appear to be moſt Subſervient unto it. But by this Method, that which is principally aimed at, is, partly that they may get a more Solid, and a Stable
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:002246_0112_0FDAD9214B9F3458"/>Knowledge of the Truth, out of the Sacred Scriptures; and partly that they may get into a greater Ability for Preaching when they ſhall have Opportunity to Speak any where, yea, anon to propound the Truth of GOD among the Nations.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Exegetical</hi> Exerciſe, we hitherto handle only particular Sentences of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; wherein ſupplying them with an Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition according to the Rules of Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we fetch out certain Poſitions which are to the point in hand; and when we have in ſome orderly manner opened ſuch a Sentence; they taking Notes hereof in writing, we leave them to their own Meditations. Whence it commonly comes to paſs, that the Things which they have thus Meditated by themſelves, they recite by Heart on the Lords<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and offer them as a Sermon for the Publick.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Theological</hi> Exerciſe, we ſhow them firſt the Fundamental Theſes, in all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of our Faith: And then we bring the ſtrongeſt Proofs for them, from Sentences of the Scripture. And that we may ſerve this End the better, we have written a certain Compendium of Divinity, of an <hi>Octavo</hi> form, in the Tongue of this <hi>Damulic</hi> Nation.</p>

May our moſt Gracious GOD, the Father of Mercies, Grant that theſe <hi>Catechiſts</hi> may in this way be ſo prepared, that even from Theſe there may be choſen thoſe, who may hereafter in the quality of Miſſionaries, take the work of this Miſſion into their manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Our Main Study is of this Tendency; That the Number of theſe may increaſe more and more; Upon which we enter into a moſt certain Hope, that in the Church, and among the Nations, by their Means, we ſhall one day ſee much Advantage and a mighty Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe, there is One already placed as a Ruler to a little Church in a certain Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage. To Others we have given the Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of <hi>Elders;</hi> to others that of <hi>Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi> whoſe Office 'tis often to Viſit the Members of the Church from Houſe to Houſe; Inſtruct them, Adviſe them, and joyn in Prayers with them; And finally, the Office of others, is, That upon ſuch as are to be Converted, and upon the Catechumens, they may <hi>Viva Voce,</hi> inculcate the moſt Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Foundations of Chriſtianity; and ſo, having firſt laid thoſe Foundations, then ſtrive to get up higher with them.</p>

If GOD pleaſe to Smile upon it, we have a Mind alſo, to make a Dictionary, in the <hi>Damulick</hi> Tongue, which may be of uſe to the <hi>Europeans</hi> as well as to this Nation. Every Page is to be divided into three Sections. In the firſt Plat, we place the <hi>Damulick</hi> words; the Primitive, and what is to be appendiced unto them. In the ſecond, over againſt the <hi>Malabarian</hi> words, we place the Pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them in Latin Characters cloſe by their ſide. In the third, we Expreſs the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification thereof in Latin.</p>
                  <p>In our Schools, where all things are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed upon free-coſt, there are fourſcore Children daily fed; Enjoying ſuch Victuals and Garments as may be neceſſary for them. Unto the reſt, there is moſt willingly allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Benefit of Inſtruction, and ſuch Books as they may want, without their paying of any thing for it.</p>

<pb n="86" facs="unknown:002246_0118_0FDAD92D483B7BA0"/>People, is tranſlated out of Darkneſs into Darkneſs, and from one Idolatry to another, without the leaſt ſenſe of the Good that in a CHRIST is to be met withal: That I may not ſay, Paganiſm is wickedly grafted into Popery.</p>
                  <p>The Word of GOD abundantly declares, That in the Latter Days there muſt ariſe Witneſſes of the Truth, endued with the <hi>Gifts of Miracles.</hi> And ſince that thread-bare ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Divines in the Church, <hi>Dona Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſa dantur propter Infideles,</hi> is a Truth ſhining with its own indiſputable Rays; we do allow, That to facilitate His work in the Converſion of the Pagans, our GOD may crown it with theſe Extraordinary Helps to it; and may furniſh His Miſſionaries with ſo great Powers, and beſtow the Gifts of Miracles upon them. However theſe things we wholly leave with the Grace, and Mercy, and Providence of Heaven; the beſt Diſpenſer of all.</p>
                  <p>That which I now deſire, is, That the Correſpondence by Letters, which you have begun with us, may be ſtill kindly continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo that the <hi>Eaſt</hi> may talk with the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and the <hi>Weſt</hi> may manifeſt unto the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> its Deſires, and the works of GOD.

               <hi>The preſent Condition of the</hi> Indians <hi>on</hi> Martha's Vineyard, <hi>Extracted from an Account of Mr.</hi> Experience Mayhew, <hi>newly Publiſhed; From whence the preſent Condition of the reſt may be apprchended.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>COncerning the Converſion of the <hi>Indians</hi> on theſe Iſlands, and places adjacent on the Main, there was a brief Narrative writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by <hi>Matthew Mayhew,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Eldeſt Son of the Rev. Mr. <hi>Thomas Mayhew,</hi> who firſt Preached the Goſpel unto them; which Narrative was Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at <hi>Boston</hi> in the Year 1694. and Reprinted at <hi>London</hi> the next Year, under the Title of, <hi>The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest and Triumphs of Grace,</hi> &amp;c. The ſame for Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, being again Printed ſome Years after, in Dr. <hi>C. Mather</hi>'s Hiſtory of <hi>New-England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall begin my Account of the State of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> from the time the ſaid Book was firſt Publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that being about the time that I firſt began to Preach to them.</p>
            <p>The Number of <hi>Indians</hi> on theſe Iſlands is very much diminiſhed, ſince the <hi>Engliſh</hi> firſt ſettled on <hi>Martha's Vineyard,</hi> which was in the Year 1642, there being then as was ſuppoſed on that Iſland about 1500 Souls. At preſent there are in the <hi>Vineyard</hi> ſix ſmall Villages, containing in all of them, about 155 Families, and the Number of Souls may be about eight hundred.</p>
            <p>Each of theſe Villages is provided with an <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="unknown:002246_0122_0FDAD93802FDABB8"/>Preacher to diſpence the Word to them on the Lord's Days, when I am not with them. They meet for the Worſhip of GOD twice a Day on the Sabbath, and after Prayer, ſing a Pſalm; then there is a Sermon Preached on ſome Portion of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which being ended, they ſing again, while the Days be of a ſufficient length; and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with Prayer.</p>
            <p>There has, from time to time, been much care taken that the ſeveral Villages might be provided with School Maſters to teach the Children to Read and Write; yet ſome of them have not been ſo conſtantly ſupplied, as is to be deſired; and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally when the Spring of the Year comes on, the Indians take their Children from School, alleging they want them for Tillage of the Land; and ſo the Schools fail till the Fall; and this has much hindred their Progreſs in Learning: Nevertheleſs, I think the greateſt number can Read, either in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> or in the <hi>Indian</hi> Tongue; and ſome in both.</p>
            <p>There is alſo care taken to <hi>Catechiſe</hi> the Youth: For beſides what is done in this kind, by the <hi>Indian</hi> School-Maſters &amp; Preachers, I frequently examine the Young People my ſelf, and have determined to attend this Service once a Fortnight, in ſome or other of the forementioned Villages; and this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod will, I hope, prove very advantageous: many grown People as well as Children, attending theſe Exerciſes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Indian</hi> Church at <hi>Marth</hi>'s-<hi>Vineyard,</hi> whereof Mr. <hi>Japhet Hannit</hi> an excellent <hi>Indian Miniſter</hi> was formerly the Paſtor, but died in the Year 1712, had after his Death another Paſtor, called <hi>Sowomog:</hi> but he being an Old Man when he was firſt called
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:002246_0123_0FDAD9732AFEF540"/>unto that Office, lived but a very few Years.</p>
            <p>The Name of the preſent Paſtor of that Church is <hi>Joaſh Pann,</hi> who is a very ſerious prudent and pious Man, of a good Converſation, and one who drinks no ſtrong drink, but is much grieved at thoſe of his Country-men who do err by means of it. If it pleaſe GOD to continue his Life, he is like to prove a good Inſtrument; but being lately fallen into a Languiſhing Diſtemper, I fear what the iſſue of it may be.</p>
            <p>The number of Communicants, both Men and Women, in this Church, is about 110. The moſt of theſe are Inhabitants of <hi>Martha's-Vineyard,</hi> but not all; there being a few that have joyned themſelves there unto, not only from <hi>Elſabeth</hi>'s Iſlands, but from the Main Land alſo, lying next unto the <hi>Vineyard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord's Supper is ordinarily Adminiſtredin that Church about 7 or 8 times in a Year, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline is in ſome meaſure kept up in it. Unto this End, beſides other Church Meetings, there is conſtantly on the <hi>Thurſday</hi> or <hi>Friday</hi> before that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is Adminiſtred, a Meeting of the Church, wherein ſuch are ſuſpended from the Lord's Table as having been over-taken in any fault, have not given due ſatisfaction. At this Meeting alſo there is ordinarily a Sermon Preached ſuitable to the occaſion.</p>
            <p>It muſt be acknowledged, that as the <hi>Indians</hi> are many of them much addicted unto ſtrong drink; ſo ſome of the Members of the Indian Church have been ſometimes found very faulty, on this account; yet it is alſo true, that ſuch as theſe have generally appeared very Penitent. And tho' ſome have fallen quite away, and ſo have been cut off by the Sword
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:002246_0124_0FDAD939DE45EC78"/>of Diſcipline; yet others thro' the G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ace of GOD, have been ſo far recovered out of the Sins into which they have fallen, as that it may be hoped they will not again return to them; and there have all along been, and ſtill are, a conſiderable number, whoſe Converſation is, ſo far as I can underſtand, very blameleſs, and who may be juſtly looked upon as Exemplary Chriſtians; what ever ſuch <hi>Engliſh Men</hi> as are filled with Prejudices againſt the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> may ſay to the contrary.</p>
            <p>Some Years after I firſt began to Preach to the <hi>Indians,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> on <hi>Martha's Vineyard,</hi> did on a day of <hi>Faſting &amp; Prayer</hi> appointed for that End, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly renew their Covenant with GOD, engaging to endeavour to forſake thoſe Sins with which they confeſſed they were too eaſily beſet; and there was after this, for a Time, ſome Reformation: but I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that two or three of the Brethren that could not be perſwaded to joyn in the Action, ſoon after fell into Scandalous Miſdemeanours.</p>
            <p>I alſo obſerved, That after the Church had thus renewed their Covenant, the Means of Grace offered unto the <hi>Indians,</hi> ſeemed for a time to be attended with more of the Preſence of GOD, and the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of His Spirit, than they were before, or have been ſince.</p>
            <p>It was then frequent to ſee Perſons at the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sermons, very much affected, and ſome times as ſoon as Sermon was ended, there would ſtand up ſeveral, one after another, and make very Penitential Confeſſions of their Sins, with Promiſes to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to Live new Lives: deſiring alſo the Prayers of the People of GOD for them.</p>
            <p>About this time there joyned in full Communion
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:002246_0125_0FDAD97549043270"/>unto that ſmall Church on the <hi>Vineyard,</hi> in one Year, at leaſt 30 Perſons, the behavour of many of whom did very much reſemble that of the Jailor, at his Converſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. GOD ſhewing us herein that He can make the <hi>Indians</hi> as well as Others a <hi>willing People in the Day of His Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is an Increaſe of Knowledge among theſe <hi>Indians,</hi> tho' it muſt be confeſſed that their progreſs herein is but ſlow, by reaſon of the want of a Learned Miniſtry conſtantly to Inſtruct them. Their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Preachers having but little Learning, and are not ſo able to ſeed them with Knowledge &amp; Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding as is to be deſired; yet ſome of theſe have Gifts not to be deſpiſed in <hi>a day of ſmall things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Indian</hi> Miniſters as they are Members in full Communion of the Church on the <hi>Vineyard,</hi> ſo they do not engage in the work of the Miniſtry without the Conſent &amp; Approbation of that Church, as well as of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miniſters that Preach unto the <hi>Indians,</hi> and have an Inſpection over them.</p>
            <p>Having now Preached to the <hi>Indians</hi> upward of 25 Years, I have never yet had any ſpecial charge of any one ſingle Congregation committed to me; but have viſited the ſeveral fore mentioned Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies alternately, as I have thought moſt neceſſary; Preaching ordinarily, unto ſome or other of them every Lord's Day, and on working days once a Fortnight; conſtantly alſo attending their Church-Meetings, to aſſiſt &amp; direct them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> when they are Sick, generally ſend for their Miniſters, and ſometimes other Chriſtians with them, to viſit them, and Pray with, and for them. I have ſome times been with them on ſuch occaſions, and heard them profeſs a great concern
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:002246_0126_0FDAD9440516BC00"/>about their Souls; declaring that they did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard any thing in this World, ſo they might obtain an Intereſt in GOD's Favour; and I have known many of them who have profeſſed a good hope thro' CHRIST in their Death, and who have behaved themſelves on all accounts as does become dying Saints; nor have I any doubt, but that many of them have died in the Lord.</p>
            <p>The Rev. Mr. <hi>Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ah Torrey,</hi> Paſtor of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church in <hi>Tisbury</hi> on the <hi>Vineyard,</hi> has alſo for many Years paſt Preached as a Lecturer unto the <hi>Indians</hi> on that Iſland, having for that End learned their Language. He Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in ſome or other of their Aſſemblies once a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, and goes frequently to their Church-Meetings, to adviſe &amp; aſſiſt them; ſo that the <hi>Indians</hi> have a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon every <hi>Thurſday</hi> Preached to them, either by Mr. <hi>Torrey,</hi> or my ſelf: And we ſtrengthen the hands of one another, by going together to theſe Weekly Exerciſes.</p>
            <p>The Rev. Mr. <hi>Samuel Wiſwall</hi> Paſtor of the Church in <hi>Edgartown,</hi> has alſo now almoſt learned the <hi>Indians</hi> Tongue, with a deſign to do what Service he can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong that People.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> on <hi>Martha's-Vineyard</hi> &amp; the adjacent Iſlands, do hitherto underſtand the <hi>Indian</hi> Tongue much better than that of the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and therefore complain much for want of <hi>Indian</hi> BIBLES, having now but very few among there. Nor are there any to be had; the laſt Edition being now gone. Theſe <hi>Indians</hi> are therefore very deſirous of mother Impreſſion of the BIBLE, if it might be obtained; and divers of hem have told me, as well as ſome of thoſe on <hi>Nantucket,</hi> (whom I have divers times viſited) that they ſhould be willing accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their capacity, to contribute to it.</p>
            <p>But the diſadvantage which the <hi>Indians</hi> are under thro' the Scarcity of BIBLES is ſome what helped by the Care of the Honourable Commiſſioners to ſupply them with other uſeful Books in their own Language, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>N. England</hi> Confeſſion of Faith; Several Catechiſms;
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:002246_0127_0FDAD97C21FCF938"/>The Practice of Piety; Mr. <hi>Shepard's</hi> Sincere Convert; Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll to the Unconverted. And ſeveral Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of Dr. <hi>Mather</hi>'s, &amp;c. beſides the Pſalter, &amp; the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of JOHN, Printed in the Year 1709. And the <hi>Indian</hi> Primer Printed this Year, in <hi>Indian</hi> and <hi>Engliſh.</hi> All which Books are now very uſeful unto them.</p>
            <p>As to their Civil Government, the <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>Dukes</hi> County, (as well as in other Places) are wholly under the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> But becauſe their State does yet ſomewhat differ from that of their <hi>Engliſh</hi> Neighbours, there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Laws made by the General Court of this <hi>Province,</hi> with a particular regard to the <hi>Indian</hi> Inhabitants of the ſame: And there are ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Juſtices eſpecially Commiſſionated to take care of the <hi>Indians</hi> Inhabiting the ſeveral Counties of it: and <hi>theſe</hi> are directed to No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainate and Appoint ſeveral Officers among the <hi>Indians</hi> themſelves, to aſſiſt under their regulation, in the Government of that People.</p>
            <p>There are yet but few <hi>Indians</hi> on <hi>Martha's. Vineyard</hi> that have Houſes of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> faſhion, tho' the number of theſe is of late increaſed; but in reſpect of their Apparel, they are generally Cloathed as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are, &amp; they by degrees learn the <hi>Engliſh</hi> way of Husbandry: Several of them have good Teams of Oxen, with which they Plough and Cart, for themſelves &amp; Neighbours, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> do. Many of them have alſo <hi>Horſes, Cows, Sheep &amp; Swine.</hi> They have alſo among them ſome that have learned Trades; as at <hi>Martha's-Vineyard</hi> there are ſeveral <hi>Weavers,</hi> One or two <hi>Houſe-Carpenters,</hi> One <hi>Wheel-wright,</hi> who is ſo good a Work-man, as to be frequently employed by his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Neighbours. There are ſeveral <hi>Tailors,</hi> &amp; one if not more <hi>Shoe-makers,</hi> and one <hi>Black ſmith,</hi> who not only took his Trade himſelf, but alſo made his Bellows, &amp; other Tools; and one <hi>Cooper, viz. William Charles,</hi> who is a good Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. And tho' ſome of theſe may not be ſo accurate as our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trades-men, yet this ſhews that as the <hi>Indians</hi> are capable of Learning ſuch Callings as <hi>Engliſh Men</hi> follow; ſo they begin to come to it.</p>
