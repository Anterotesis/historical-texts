            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>'TIS one of the Aphorisms of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccl. II. 14. <hi>A wise mans eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness.</hi> No where does Wisdom appear in a greater Lustre, than in weighing things in a just Balance, and proportioning
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001538_0004_0FB3AC48699F6928"/>
our Care and Labour, according to the nature and intrinsick worth and value of them; and fixing our chief Concern upon that which is of the greatest Weight and Moment to us: For this manifestly discovers, that we have a clear &amp; distinct View of things; know where our greatest interest lies; how to move in a strait line, and take the nearest course to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it. Whereas, they that content themselves with a transient view of things, are often led into wild Mistakes about their true interest; are apt to conclude that to be so, which upon Examination would be found to be of little or no Consequence to 'em; and hence they spend themselves in vain and to no purpose: by which means they evidently declare their Folly, and that they walk in Darkness.</p>
            <p>This then is the distinguishing Character be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Wife Man, &amp; the Fool, &amp; what we may form a Judgment of 'em by; <hi>
                  <abbr>viz.</abbr>
               </hi> their <hi>Closest Application:</hi> What is it fixes their Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and commands their Attention? Are they the lower and more trifling Matters that most of all engage 'em? Or, do they keep more noble Ends in their view? steadily pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue what does more nearly concern them, &amp; regard these lesser Matters only by the By?</p>
            <p>This now holds good with respect to the Wisdom of this World. But when we consider this, and the future World, our Souls
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001538_0005_0FB3AC4CDD497790"/>
and our Bodies apart, (to the one or other of which our greatest Care and Labour must be restrained,) the Wise man will plainly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover himself by his Choice; he will prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adjust his Labours after this World, so as that they mayn't be an impediment, or give any interruption to the greater Business he has upon his hands; <hi>
                  <abbr>viz.</abbr>
               </hi> that of securing the welfare of his Soul; which he firstly regards, and reaches after with the utmost pains and sedulity. In order hereto, 'twill be necessary for him, to have a full Conviction of the worth of his Soul; of what importance the Salvation of it is to him, and how much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low its Dignity all the things of this World are; and therefore how much less he ought to be concern'd about them, than about the grand affairs of Futurity; that he must by no means suffer the little Interests of the Flesh to turn the Scale against the weighty Concerns of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>To this end my Text serves; <hi>For what is a Man Profited, if he shall gain the whole World, and lose his own Soul? or what shall a man give in Exchange for his Soul?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Paragraph to which these words belong, our Saviour gives us the Essential Qualification of His true Disciples: <hi>If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his Cross, and follow me.</hi> He is one
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001538_0006_0FB3AC4E8B58A5D8"/>
that for the sake of Christ, is ready to part with every thing in this World, tho' never so dear to him; to deny himself not only of his Sensual Gratifications, but of those Enjoyments which are justly valuable to him, nay, even of Life it self; when they stand in Competition with the cause of Christ. And the reason why he must thus deny himself, is given in the next words; <hi>For whosoever will save his Life shall lose it.</hi> He that for the sake of any earthly En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment; tho' it be to preserve his Life, shall forsake Christ and His Cause; shall find he has miss'd his aim, and lost the happiness he sought, in losing a Life infinitely more valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than this: <hi>But whosoever shall lose his Life for my sake, shall find it;</hi> he shall find in the Conclusion, that by his Fidelity to Me &amp; My Interest, he has been the greatest Gainer, tho he hath parted with all this World for Me; for he has secured the Life of his immortal Soul.</p>
            <p>As a further Argument to follow Christ whither-soever He shall lead us, though it be with our Cross upon our Shoulders, the words of my Text are bro't in; which shows us, how little will be the <hi>Gains,</hi> and how great the <hi>Loss,</hi> if for the sake of preserving this Life and the Enjoyments of it, we should part with the Life that is to come: <hi>For what is a man Profited? &amp;c.</hi> If a man have Gained never so much of this World, tho' it should be the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001538_0007_0FB3AC4FEB7EBC30"/>
Whole of it, if it be at the Expense and Loss of his Soul, he will see at the foot of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt, that he has made an Unprofitable Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; his Loss is so great, that his Gains are no ways Equivalent; and so Irreparable, that the whole World, were it in his power, would not be sufficient to give in Exchange for his Soul.</p>
            <p>In the Words, 'tis <hi>First,</hi> taken for <hi>Granted,</hi> that the <hi>World,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Soul</hi> stand Competitors, and are Rivals in address; and there is great <hi>Hazzard,</hi> left the World be hearken'd to.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Soul,</hi> the Heaven-born, Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and Immortal part of the man, which raises him above the Brute, and distinguishes him with the bright characters of his Divine O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal, from the rest of the visible Creation; that this Courts his Love in the Most pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical address, and challenges his thought and pains proportionable to its worth &amp; dignity.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>World,</hi> the things that we Converse with here, which lye level to Sense, and we necessarily have some respect to while we Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle in Flesh, that must be fed &amp; cloathed; that this also Sues for the greatest Interest in our Affections; and under all appearances, with the most splendid and courtly shew, and specious pretences, endeavours the possession of our highest Love; and there is great Haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, lest the Charms of the World prevail
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001538_0008_0FB3AC5239620488"/>
upon us, and we make a Surrender of our selves to it.</p>
            <p>And then, <hi>Secondly,</hi> we have it <hi>Asserted,</hi> in favour of the Soul, that he makes an <hi>Unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Bargain</hi> of it, who for the sake of <hi>Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the <hi>World, Loses</hi> his <hi>Soul:</hi> Who receives the Address of the World, hearkens to its insinuations, and places his affections upon it; at the same time disregarding the more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Entreaties of the Soul. For the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery of it is, that if the Address of the World be admitted, the Soul is unavoidably Lost. The <hi>Soul</hi> may be made our chief Concern, and yet a sufficiency of the World be secured to us; but we can't make the <hi>World</hi> our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Business, but it will certainly be at the Expense of the Soul. The World <hi>May,</hi> but the Soul <hi>Can't</hi> come in as a Servitor, &amp; be treated by the By only. 'Twill then be no ways to his <hi>Profit,</hi> but his unspeakable Damage and <hi>Loss,</hi> to prefer the World to his Soul: As plainly appears from hence; <hi>What shall a man give in exchange for his Soul?</hi> If he were never so willing to purchase the recovery of his lost Soul, at the Price of all that he has, or all that he can wish for of this World, it would not be sufficient to Redeem it. The mighty advantage he thought to have made to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, by throwing off the care of his Soul, and hugging the World as his Darling, will all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear;
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001538_0009_0FB3AC53A9481D80"/>
and he will see, that he has Play'd the Fool Egregiously, in his rash and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate Choice; when he comes to find, that the whole World is not a valuable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, for the Redemption of the Soul he has parted with to Gain it.</p>
            <p>According to this View of the Words, there are these Two General Heads of Discourse for me to insist upon. [I.] That there is extream Hazzard and Danger, lest the Soul be Lost for the sake of Gaining the World. [I.I.] That whatever any may Gain of this World, if it be at the Expense and Loss of the Soul, 'twill be the most Unprofitable Bargain.</p>
            <p>Accordingly;</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is <hi>Extream Hazzard and Danger,</hi> lest the Soul should be Lost for the sake of Gaining This World.</p>
            <p>MAN is justly look'd upon as the Top of the visible Creation, and a kind of Medium between <hi>Bòdy</hi> and <hi>Spirit;</hi> for he is neither one nor the other consider'd alone, but both in a near &amp; happy Union; by which means he stands ally'd to <hi>Two</hi> Worlds with respect to This Body, to <hi>This</hi> in which we now dwell; and with regard to his Soul or Spirit, to <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> World, which here he <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001538_0010_0FB3AC58F3FD1118"/>
and Probationer for. Hence arises the Contest between Flesh and Spirit, the things of Time and Eternity. This World, on the one hand, makes interest with our Fleshly part, and courts our Choice; and the Glory and Happiness of the Future World, on the other hand, presents it self to our Spiritual man, as more worthy of our regards. Now tis impossible that we should be equally alike concern'd for Both of these at the same time; but while we <hi>Cleave</hi> to the one, we shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily <hi>Forsake</hi> the other; if we <hi>Love</hi> the one, we shall discover our <hi>Hatred</hi> of the other by our Slighting of it, <hi>Mat.</hi> VI. 24.</p>
            <p>This now shews us, wherein lies the <hi>Loss</hi> of the Soul; not in its Annihilation, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reduced to Nothing; (this indeed may be sadly wish'd for, but shall never be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd by those miserable Wretches that lose them;) but, in its Forfeiture and Loss of all the Happiness, Joy and Pleasure of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture World; and Consequently, in inheriting all that Misery which is contrary thereunto for the Soul can't remain in a state of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency; but her Exquisite Sensation will necessarily involve her in all the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happiness and Misery, contrary to the Good She is deprived of.</p>
            <p>And tis granted, as an Unquestionable Truth, that he that <hi>Gains</hi> the World, thus
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001538_0011_0FB3AC5A73F37810"/>
               <hi>Loses</hi> his Soul. Not that barely our acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this or that, is to be esteemed the Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the World, in the sense our Saviour speaks; for while we dwell here, the Body must be provided for; and we are oblig'd as Men, and Christians, to such a just Industry in our proper Business, as we may rationally expect some Worldly Gains from: But it means, our Loving the World above every thing else, and for the Gaining of it, to make it our chief Care and Business, and accounting what we get of this World to be the only Gains; He who thus Gains the World, undoubtedly Loses his Soul.</p>
            <p>Here then lies the <hi>Danger,</hi> lest while we Converse with this World, it gain the ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant over us, six our Hearts and Affections, and extort from us the chiefest of our Tho't and Care; left it put us upon neglecting the weighty Concerns of Immortality, turning our backs upon the Blessedness and Glory of the future World, and so our Souls become Lost for ever. And this, I say, there is extream Hazzard and Danger of.</p>
            <p>For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Do but consider the <hi>Advantage</hi> this World has on its side, in its striking so directly, &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon the <hi>Senses.</hi> Tis the world we dwell in; and must necessarily hold some Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with, while we carry about with us a
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001538_0012_0FB3AC5BEC4D1080"/>
load of Flesh. Tis wonderfully suited to our Outward Fleshly part, but has no kindred and affinity with our Immortal Spirits, which the Future World more peculiarly belongs to Every thing here exactly agrees with our Senses. We see, we feel, we taste the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of this World, and all our Senses are gratified from it. What advantage has it over us by this Means? For the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication from the Senses to the Intellectual Powers, renders the Soul necessarily affected with what affects the Body, enclines her to will and embrace what is agreeable to the Body, and to refuse the contrary.</p>
            <p>And besides, we need no dint of Argument and severe Reasonings, to convince us of the Truth and Reality of these things; so appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and self-evident are they to our Senses: Whereas, we need to summon our Rational Powers, and closely apply our Thoughts; and when we have been most Intense and deep in our Enquiries, and made the fairest Discoveries we can, we must exert our Faith, to confirm to us the Being of a future World, and the Truth and Reality of its Happiness and Misery. Yea, tho' the existence of the Soul is Self-evident; yet so much clearer &amp; plainer is the evidence of the Body, and the things relating to it, that we are ready to lose the view of our Souls, in the brighter appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001538_0013_0FB3AC5D8C310860"/>
of this World to us. There needs no Arguments, to convince a Hungry man, that he is so; or one Athirst, that he wants Drink; but we need the strongest Arguments, to convince us of the Wants of the Soul.</p>
            <p>Thus, by the force this World has upon the Body, we are put upon pleading necessity for it; tis what we can't do without, as well as what will greatly delight and entertain us.</p>
            <p>Now then, what extream <hi>Hazzard</hi> is there, left for the sake of Gaining this World, we neglect the Care of the Soul? What great Danger are we in, of having our Hearts en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage with our Senses, listen to the pleas of the World, and we give it all our Love? What Danger, left we submit our selves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to the Empire and Dominion of our Senses, which are so near akin to this world, and have such influence upon us? Left we think no more of those Spirits, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to us in so dim a Light; or, of a coming World, which is at such an unknown Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from us, and Sense has so little Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Truth of? Left we give the loose to our Appetites, &amp; not only neglect the important Interest of the Soul, but take those methods to gain this sensible World, which strike directly at the Foundation of its Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness? And so the Soul be utterly Lost.</p>
            <p>Again,</p>

               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:001538_0014_0FB3AC5EE89D3780"/>2. The extream Danger we are in, of set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our Hearts upon this World, will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appear, if we consider the force of our <hi>Natural Depravity;</hi> and the Advantage which <hi>Satan</hi> makes of it. We have <hi>all Sinned, and come short of the Glory of God</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="bottom">

               </note>.</p>
            <p>Now, this is the <hi>Injury</hi> and Mischief done us by our Apostacy from God, that the Soul is sunk vastly below its Original Dignity; and with its Primitive Rectitude, has lost much of its Royal Prerogative, Empire, and Dominion over the Senses: that instead of being the Guide, and Director of our Senses, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of our Sensual Appetites, 'tis now subjected to their Influence and Sway. The Revolution which Sin has made, has given the lower Appetites the ascendant; that now the Soul is forced to see thro' their Glasses, has a strong Bias put upon her, her Volition and Choice is Govern'd by the greedy desires of Sense, and her mean and low Joys rise chiefly from Sensual Gratifications. Now, from this superiour Influence the Senses, &amp; lower Passions and Affections have, you may
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001538_0015_0FB3AC63A5D3EA08"/>
easily see, what extream Danger we are in, of being so careful and troubled about the Many things of this Life, as to neglect the One thing Needful.</p>
            <p>Besides, how eagerly does <hi>Satan</hi> bring home to us the force of Temptations from the World? What an edge does he give 'em? while he presents the World to us in the most Gaudy and Beautiful appearance. How does he fire our Ambition with a View of the Glory of this World? Charm us with the momentany Delights and Pleasures of Sin? And Encourage us with the Prospect of the vast Advantage we may make to our selves by these things? So does he enkindle our Desires after them, and quicken our Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to grasp a Portion in this Life, tho' we should be destitute for ever hereafter.</p>
            <p>Hence tis, that the Natural man is wholly under the Power of this World; <hi>Walking ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Course of this World; according to the Prince of the power of the Air; the Spirit that works in the Children of Disobedience,</hi> Eph. II. 2. And even the Child of God, who is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased from the Tyranny of Sense, yet finds <hi>a Law in his Members, warring against the Law of his Mind,</hi> Rom. VII. 23. That if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider him with no greater Guard &amp; Security than what he has from himself, there would be great Danger, lest thro' the workings of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001538_0016_0FB3AC64EDA3CAC8"/>
the Remainder of Corruption that is in him, and the Subtilty of Satan, his grand Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, he should determine his Choice for this World, and lose his Soul for ever.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The extream Hazzard there is of Losing a Soul for the sake of Gaining this World, is Evident, from the <hi>Natural Tendency of all our Worldly Possessions.</hi> Tis but the natural produce of what we Enjoy in this world, to have our Eyes more blinded, our Desires en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, and our Lusts encreased by it.</p>
            <p>It tends to <hi>Blind</hi> the eyes of the Soul; it casts a mist before her, that She shan't be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to take a fair View of things, nor see 'em in their proper Shape and Colours. We read, Deut. XVI. 19. <hi>A gift blindeth the eyes of the wise.</hi> Thus the things we enjoy, (which we are apt to look upon as Gifts from the world, they) hinder our fight of any thing but in favour of it. They miserably Cloud and Darken our Apprehensions in Spiritual and Heavenly things, that we can't see their Just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Beauty, and the lasting Importance they are to us. This we enjoy appears Fair and Comely, and tempts us to say with the rich Fool, <hi>Eat, Drink, and be Merry there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Luke xi<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:001538_0017_0FB3AC66B2D7BB58"/>Again; Thus what we Enjoy tends to <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame our Desires</hi> after a larger &amp; fairer Interest in the world. For tasting the sweet of this little, we conclude it must be much more pleasant to feed upon a larger Income, and hence are excited to Cry, <hi>Give, Give.</hi> Hence 'tis, that every Stone shall be turned, and the most Unjust Method taken, rather than such Joy shall be with-held from our longing De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and our greedy Thirst after Riches go Unquenched.</p>
            <p>Thus also, our worldly Possessions tend to <hi>Encrease our Lusts;</hi> our Pride, Ambition, Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the like; and so more subject the Soul under the Government of the world; all of which bars the Happiness of the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture World, and evidently destroyes the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being of the Soul. Hence we are told, I Tim. VI. 9. <hi>They that will be Rich, fall into Temptation and a Snare, and many foolish and hurtful Lusts; which drown men in Destruction and Perdition.</hi> And yet this is the Natural Tendency of all our worldly Enjoyments; which nothing but the Grace of God can prevent. How great then is the Danger, let our Affections be entirely Possessed by the World, and for the sake of Gaining it, we Lose our Souls? Bar to add no more;</p>
            <p n="4">4. Our Blessed Saviour hath <hi>Warn'd</hi>us, of the extream Danger of losing the Soul to gain
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001538_0018_0FB3AC68094C89F8"/>
the World. He does so in my Text; What is a man Profited, if he Gain the whole World, and Lose his own Soul? Which as well sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses the Hazzard, lest a man do so, as asserts the Unprofitableness of his Bargain. And so in the words foregoing my Text, <hi>He that will save his Life shall lose it;</hi> which imply's the very great danger there is, left for the sake of this Life and the Enjoyments peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly relating to it, we should refuse to take up our Cross, and follow our Lord; and so lose the life of our Souls. And hence tis, our Lord hath told us, <hi>Luke</hi> XVI. 8. That the <hi>Children of this world, are wiser in their Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than the Children of Light:</hi> They are not only more Prudent in Consulting the best means, and more Industrious in the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those means to attain their ends, to grow Rich &amp; Honourable in this world, than the Children of Light are to secure to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the Treasures of the Heavenly World; but than the Children of Light are to <hi>Gain this world.</hi> You rarely see a Christian of great Attainments in Grace and Holiness, who lives in a fair View of the Eternal World as his Portion, that is <hi>Wise</hi> for the things of this world, like them who have their Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this Life; but as his Spiritual Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom encreases, his worldly Wisdom abates and the Reason is plain, because a man can
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001538_0019_0FB3AC6A4C3726C8"/>
scarcely be every way Wise about the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of this Life, without setting his Heart upon 'em, and making 'em his chief Business. Hence also, our Lord has given us this awful Admonition, Mat XIX. 23, 24, <hi>Verily, a rich man shall hardly enter into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.—It is easier for a Camel to go thro' the eye of a Needle, than for a Rich man to enter into Kingdom of God.</hi> For, tis next to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, that a Rich man should not set his Heart upon these things; and contented with his present Portion, take no thought of securing a Portion in the Kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>If therefore, I see a man encreased in Wealth and Honour, who in the midst of all his worldly Enjoyments, and the hurry and business he is necessarily Engaged in, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a just Concern for his own Soul, &amp; wisely makes sure of a more enduring Substance; I look upon him, as one of the <hi>Brightest</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the Infinite Grace of GOD; and shall Honour him, as one that is possessed with more eminent measures of that Grace and Spirit, which only can support him in his Slippery places, and preserve him safe in the midst of those far greater Dangers, than others, not Circumstanc'd like him, are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassed withal.</p>
            <p>And now upon a View of this Head; Can we consider, how nearly this world stands
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001538_0020_0FB3AC6BAFC362F0"/>
ally'd to us, how sensibly it affects us, how easily it makes way to our affections, and with what advantage of Grandeur, and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisicence, Delight and Gallantry, it Courts our Love? Can we think, how much our Sinful Souls are disorder'd and subjected to the Government of our Passions, and the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of Flesh and Sense; that, the Enemy that is lodg'd within us, waits the first op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to open the Gates, and let the World into our hearts; and an envious Devil is ever soothing us to the Chains, and calming us into Subjection? Can we view the force of what we already Enjoy, to stir up our gust &amp; relish, to urge our endeavours after more, and cloud our sight of Eternal things? Can we read the awful Admonitions and Warnings our Saviour has given us, of the Snares of a deluding World? I say, Can we seriously consider these things? and not not the extream Hazzard and Danger, lest the world prove too hard for us, we are <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 word">

            <p>But I proceed to the Second General Head, <hi>

               </hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. That whatever any may <hi>Gain of this World,</hi> if it be at the Expense and <hi>Loss of the Soul,</hi> 'twill be the most <hi>Unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Bargain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:001538_0021_0FB3AC6F1B2A3558"/>You have seen the Danger, left a Soul be Lost, to Gain a World; and now I am to cast up the Accompts, and see what wou'd be got by the Bargain. In order to this,</p>
            <p n="1">I. I shall distinctly Sum up the Gain, and the Loss by themselves.</p>
            <p n="2">II. And then Balance the Accompt, and see whether the Gains be Equivalent to the Loss</p>
            <p>Agreeably,</p>
            <p n="1">I. I shall <hi>Distinctly Sum up</hi> the Gains, and the Loss by themselves.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us see what is <hi>Gained:</hi> which is here supposed to be the <hi>whole World.</hi> But by the way; Tis impossible any one Man shou'd Gain the <hi>Whole</hi> World into his own Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session; the greatest Monarch, that ever boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Universal Empire, has had but a small part of the World compar'd with the whole: However, to make all possible Allowance for the Gains, I shall suppose it to be the whole World; and if we consider, that he that has placed his Affections, in the sense I have been speaking of, upon the whole, it will vindicate the allowance.</p>
            <p>But then, The world is not <hi>properly Gained;</hi> for nothing is so, but what a Man can call his <hi>own</hi> from a true <hi>Propriety</hi> he has in it. Now after all pretences to Possession, if his Title
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001538_0022_0FB3AC72324E0570"/>
be Challeng'd, we shall find the Man has no Right to it; he may have a just Claim to this or that, with respect to his fellow-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; But, <hi>the earth is the Lord's, with the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein,</hi> Psal XXIV. I. God only is the Great Lord-Propietor of all; and every man is but His Steward, and holds all that he has at Good Pleasure only. However, Suppose he has truly <hi>Gained</hi> the world, and has a Right and Propriety in it. And now after all this allowance, let us see what tis that he has Gained:</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Tis an <hi>Empty, Unsatisfactory</hi> World. Tis empty of all that Good which the Man hoped to enjoy, and which only is suitable to him. For, this world is neither Man's chief Good, nor of it self leading to that which is so: the Man has therefore grosly mistaken his interest, and the means to attain it. And hence when he has Gained what he reached after, he finds himself deceived; tis not the thing he thought it, not what he fought for. Thus under all his acquisitions, he remains unsatisfy'd: nor is it in the power of the whole world, to yield Satisfaction to a Man that has a Soul in him; which however de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, yet has a fort of Boundlessness and Infinity in its Cravings; and won't rest Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, unless the Supream Good, the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001538_0023_0FB3AC73F2D4AE18"/>
All, he has some faint breathings after, in his imperfect State, come and fill him with everlasting Satisfaction: For this whole world is not that infinite All, but GOD only; and therefore, tho' he shou'd Gain it all, there wou'd be still something which the World cou'd not afford, and without which the Man cou'd not be truly Satisfy'd; but he wou'd still wish New Worlds to Gain, as <hi>Alexander</hi> did to Conquer. Hence tis, that King <hi>Solomon,</hi> who had tasted as much of the sweet of the world as any Man, assures us, Eccl. 1. 8. <hi>The eye is not satisfied with seeing, not the ear with hearing:</hi> And Chap. V. 10. <hi>He that loveth silver, shall not be satisfied therewith; nor he that loveth abundance with increase. The rivers run into the sea, and yet the sea is not full;</hi> as that wise Man tells us: And as easily can a Soul of boundless Capacities, lodge the whole world in a narrow Corner, and be as far from having its appetites filled and satisfied as ever, Hence tis we daily see, that those who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the largest Portion of this world are as uneasy in their desires as others: nay, they may well be the more so, for the fuller ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience they have of the Emptiness, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfactoriness of it all.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Tis a World, which not only is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to <hi>Prevent Trouble,</hi> or <hi>Support</hi> them under it, but does it self <hi>Create</hi> them abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001538_0024_0FB3AC7587ED28D8"/>
This whole World wou'd not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to secure them, from the Sorrows and Afflictions, which necessarily attend upon their Make and Frame; and how little a way will it all go, to keep their hearts from fainting in a day of Adversity? Tis not the fairest ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance this world can make to him, that will sooth and calm a Soul under the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and anguish of an awakened Conscience, and the sense of Guilt; especially, such as may arise from a view of the manner of his acquiring it, and what he has lost for it. When he has most need of this world, he will find it most useless to him: his bags of Gold won't be able to Bribe the Angel of Death; nor the solidest Props of his Throne Support him and prevent his stumbling upon the dark Mountain: but though he may be called a <hi>God,</hi> yet he <hi>shall Die like a Man,</hi> Psal. I, XXXII. 6, 7. Nor will all his Enjoyments afford him a Plea, to wipe away his Guilt in the day of Trial; for they will <hi>not profit him in the day of wrath,</hi> Prov. XI. 4. Nor will they be able to fill his mouth with Songs, and his heart with Rejoycing, while everlasting Burning surrounds him: but, tho' <hi>in his life time, he had his good things;</hi> yet now <hi>he is in Torment,</hi> the whole World can't supply him with <hi>a drop of water to cool his Tongue,</hi> Luk. XVI. 23,24.</p>
            <p>But then, the whole will conspire to <hi>Give</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:001538_0025_0FB3AC76F33158C0"/>
him abundance of Uneasiness; and he will find it to be <hi>Vexation of Spirit,</hi> as well as <hi>Vanity</hi>

But I suppose him to have Gained it, and therefore shall not insist upon the trouble he meets with in the way to it: and only say, he will not want for Vexation in the <hi>Improvement</hi> of it. For his Possessions wou'd be unweildy; as we see those that have the fairest Estates, are ordinarily less able to manage them with Ease and Comfort. He wou'd find his Interests often jarr and clash together; Disappointments wou'd break in upon him; his best Schemes fail; and his frustrated Endeavours wou'd throw him into as much Confusion within, as his Affairs are without. Tis impossible it shou'd be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, while a Finite, Clouded, Debauched Mind had the concerting of Measures, and the managing of all the Affairs of the world, for its sensual Gratifications.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Tis but a <hi>Fading, Perishing</hi> World that he has Gained. Decay is written in indelible Characters upon all the Glory of this world: and we see a little time puts a Period to the greatest Lustre and Beauty of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We our Selves</hi> daily Change; we alter our

Taste and Relish; and what was pleasant and delightful to our Palate a little while ago, is now the least grateful and acceptable to us. As we advance in Years, we lose our Gust for those Entertainments which delighted us in Youth. We see to, that a Man of Wisdom and Strength, may become a Child in Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Folly; a Man of Beauty &amp; Honour, lose the gay Airs of his Countenance, and be rob'd of his Glory.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>whole World</hi> is a continued Scene of <hi>Changes:</hi> the very <hi>Heavens wax old as a Garment</hi>

And yet this will be the Condition of all the Living e're longs their <hi>Riches,</hi> and all the Glory of this world, <hi>will make to it self wings,</hi> &amp; <hi>flee away,</hi> Prov. XXIII. 5. And he that <hi>Boasts</hi> most <hi>in his Wealth,</hi> shall, in a little time, be <hi>laid in the Grave, and Death shall feed upon him.</hi> So is all that he has Gained Fading &amp; Perishing.

               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:001538_0027_0FB3AC7BF2556FE0"/>(4.) Besides; While he does Enjoy this mighty Gain, tis <hi>suited only to his Body,</hi> the <hi>Meaner</hi> part of the man. Such is the very Nature of all he Enjoys, that it answers only to his Body; which is but the Brutal part of the man; and it has no real affinity to a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Immortal Soul, which is of too Angelical a Nature to have its Wants and Circumstances answered by Sensible Objects. Tis therefore, a Gain of the lowest Nature, because of the lowest Order of things, and suited only to the Meanest part of the man.</p>
            <p>And now, If you suppose a man at the Head of the World, on a more exalted Throne than <hi>Ahasuerus,</hi> who Ruled over an Hundred and Twenty Seven Provinces; Wealthier than <hi>Crasus;</hi> and surfeiting on all the Delights of the greatest Voluptuary; yet, if all that he has gain'd be, a World that can't Satisfy him; a World that can't Secure him from Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, but Procure them; that is Perishing in the Using of it; and at best suited only to his Brutal part; than I am sure, tis but Poor Gains after all ! And yet thus it wou'd fare with him who shou'd Gain the whole of it, at the Loss of his Soul.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us now cast up the other Accompt and see what is the <hi>Loss</hi> he has sustained, for the sake of this Gain. Tis here said to be a <hi>Soul.</hi> To take a distinct View of the Loss,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001538_0028_0FB3AC7E30AAF048"/>

From its <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Endowments.</hi> If we View it in its Nature, tis a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Being: For <hi>there is a Spirit in man, and the Inspiration of the Almighty giveth him Understanding,</hi> Job XXXII. 8. Tis all over the Book of God styled a Spirit: tis so in regard of the subtlety and purity of its Substance; tis of an Angelical Contexture; and not formed of gross Matter, as the Body, and this World are: And tho' it be invisible to our Bodily Eyes, and unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible by our Senses, yet it is most Active and Vigorous. How quick are its Motions? How powerful its Operations?</p>
            <p>Again; Tis the <hi>Principle of Life</hi> in us; God <hi>Breathed into man the breath of Life and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a living Soul,</hi> Gen. II. 7. Tis the Union of this to the Body that upholds us in Life: And if the Spirit return to God that gave it, the Body returns to its original Dust.</p>
            <p>Again; Tis an <hi>Immortal</hi> Spirit. Tis not composed of any preaeexistent Matter, subject to decay, as our Bodies are; tis possess'd with aspirations after immortality; and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:001538_0029_0FB3AC7F39860748"/>
Scripture every where treats it as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal; it assures us, <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi>X.28.</note> it <hi>cannot be Killed;</hi> it sets before it <hi>Eternal Happiness</hi> and <hi>Misery,</hi> as its Reward of Punishment; <note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi>XXV.46.</note> and God Challenges it as His Name, to be the <hi>God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob;</hi> and He is the <hi>God of the Living, not of the Dead.</hi>
               <note n="(c)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi>xxi.32.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Thus its <hi>Endowments</hi> be speak its Worth &amp; Dignity. The Soul is capable of <hi>Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> the Nature of other things, the Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and Connexion of Causes and Effects; tis capable of Retiring within it self, taking a view of its own Essence, and reflecting upon its own Actions. The <hi>Spirit of a man which is in him, knoweth the things of a man,</hi> 1 Cor. II. 11. Tis capable of knowing God, &amp; Jesus Christ, whom He hath sent; whom to know is Life Eternal.</p>
            <p>Besides, it acts by Counsel, and is able to <hi>Determine its Choice,</hi> and always Acts as a <hi>Free</hi> and Spontaneous Agent: that even in the work of Conversion, the <hi>Will</hi> is not forced, but guided and directed; and as such <hi>God works in the Soul both, to</hi> Will, <hi>and to</hi> Do, <hi>of His own good Pleasure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this excellent Nature of the Soul shews, that tis to be preferred to the Body, to all the enjoyments of this World, and to Life it self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:001538_0030_0FB3AC80C482CCE8"/>2. The worth of the Soul may be judg'd of, by the <hi>Regards those that best know it have to it. God,</hi> who is infinitely well acquainted with all things, esteems it Precious and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lauble: Hence, He insists upon it as His ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, <hi>Zech.</hi> XII. 1. I, the Lord, <hi>that formed the Spirit of man within him.</hi> And He has ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested His esteem of it, in the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of our Salvation, which has more peculiar reference to the Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> also esteems it Precious; as is evident if we Consider, what He has Done, and Suffered for it. He has not tho't it too much, to leave the Delights of His Father's Kingdom, to assume our Nature, to pass thro' all imaginable Indignities and Sufferings, to lay down His Life, and all to Purchase this Valuable things to Himself, and make it His own Inheritance.</p>
            <p>And they will appear Valuable, if we Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the Pains the <hi>Apostate Spirits</hi> are at, to Secure our Souls to themselves; how deep they lay their Designs, how unwearied they are in the Execution of their Purposes, to compass this great End, the gaining of our Souls for their own Possession; and, that tho' they have Secured Millions of Miserable Wretches, yet they are as vigorous and eager as ever to Gain more.</p>
            <p>All of this evidently shews the worth of
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:001538_0031_0FB3AC8251C05790"/>
the Soul, to be very great. Tis such a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and Valuable thing that is <hi>Lost,</hi> for the sake of <hi>Gaining</hi> the World.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Consider the <hi>Nature of the Loss;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Loss of the Soul consists. You may remember I said before, it does not ly in the <hi>Annihilation</hi> of the Soul; yet if <hi>This</hi> were the Loss of it, tis certainly a great deal too much, to destroy the Essence and Being of so No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a thing as a Soul, for the sake of Gaining this World: But this can't be what is meant, for I have shewed tis immortal, and can never Dye. It must therefore be the loss of its hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness and well-being, which consists in the Image and Favour of God.</p>
            <p>Wherefore,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Loss of the Soul lies, in its being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the <hi>Image of God.</hi> The Image of God is <hi>Holiness and Rightcousness, Eph.</hi> IV. 24. After this image and likeness the Soul was at first Created; But since the man has chosen this World rather than Heaven, and been guilty of that Covetousness which is Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he has lost that Glorious Image, and now his Soul is become Polluted and Unholy. Its Rectitude was its Glory; but now all its Powers are disordered; the Understanding and Will often interfere, the Passions clash together, and the Love of the world has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved it in thick Confusion. Since it has
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001538_0032_0FB3AC83B01AA6C8"/>
submitted to the World, tis become the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Sin and Lust, is sold under Sin, and stoops to the meanest Drudgery of it. It has now contracted an Enmity against God, is not subject to His Law, nor indeed can be; for since the <hi>Love of the World</hi> has gain'd the ascendant, <hi>the Love of the Father dwells not in him,</hi> I Joh. II. 15. So that now it has no lines of the Divine Likeness upon it, but what will aggravate its Misery; its Spirituality, which renders its Apprehensions Exquisite; and its Immortality, its Pains Lasting.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Loss of the Soul lies, in its being <hi>Destitute of the Favour of God.</hi> For having turned its Back upon God, for the sake of this World, incensed Justice will for ever Exclude such a Soul, from any Tokens of the Divine Favour in the World to come. It has lost the bright Presence of the ever Glorious God, the Fellowship of the holy Angels, the Society of perfected Spirits, and sweet Communion with a Triumphant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. Vastly great is this Loss indeed! To lose that God who is the only adequate Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an immortal Soul! To lose that Mercy and Favour, and all the Dear Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of immense Love, which a Crucified Saviour has Purchased!—And yet this is the Loss they sustain, who prefer the Care of their Bodies, to their Souls: And <hi>He that
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001538_0033_0FB3AC85CCBBCFB8"/>
Made them will not have Mercy on them, and He that Formed them will shew'em no Favour.</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Isa.</hi>xxvii.11.</note> There is not a Smile in the Divine Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for them, nothing but angry Frowns; which will fill them with Terror &amp; Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. When they pass into the Future World, God will say to them, <hi>Depart from me, ye workers of Iniquity, I know you not.</hi> 
               <note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> vii.23.</note> And this dreadful Sentence will immediately take place upon them, and they will be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally Banished His Favour; even beyond the reach of Mercy to relieve them. They had Chosen this World for their God, and now they may get all the Favour from it they can; for there is none to be found any where else for them. So in losing their Souls, they have lost Heaven, and Happiness, and God Himself. As a Surplussage, and what neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily follows upon this, I may add,</p>
            <p n="3">3. There will be this in the Loss of the Soul, its <hi>Eternal Existing in Misery, Pain, and Anguish.</hi> If the <hi>Loving Kindness of God is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Life:</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> Ixiii..3</note> then on the contrary, to be Excluded His Favour is worse than Death. The Happiness of the Glorified lies, in their near Conformity to the Image of God, and their beholding of His Face in Glory; and tis the Misery of the Damned, to be most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001538_0034_0FB3AC8971D92B60"/>
Him, &amp; excluded His Presence. Now the Soul will be sensible of the happiness it has lost, and this apprehension will wrack and torture it beyond all imagination. How will its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections lash and sting it? And make every where, separated from God, an hell to it? Yea, set up a hell within it self! Which it can no more get rid of, than it can cease to be.</p>
            <p>But besides, there is an <hi>Hell,</hi> or a <hi>Place of Torment,</hi> which God of old hath fore-ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for them that slight the Blessedness of Heaven; where Rivers of Brimstone, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extinguishable Flames prey upon the forsaken Soul. The Sentence is not only, <hi>Depart ye Cursed,</hi> which rouses the Never-dying Worm to fasten his corroding Teeth upon them; but, <hi>Depart into everlasting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels,</hi> Mat. XXV.41. Which fixes the Soul in the midst of inexpressible Pain &amp; Torment; while the Body too, which has occasioned the loss of the Soul for the pampering of it, Roars out its endless Ejula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This is the Loss of the Soul! Oh! Who would be so mad, to run the risque of this Loss, for the sake of Gaining the whole World!</p>
            <p n="2">II. And now, let us <hi>Balance the Accompt,</hi> and see whether or no the <hi>Gain is equivalent to the Loss.</hi> Can we subduct the Loss from
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:001538_0035_0FB3AC8B2B4B86D0"/>
the Gain? Alas! Alas! The Loss is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the most; and the whole World is not a valuable Consideration to give again in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for the lost Soul. <hi>What shall a man give in Exchange?</hi> Fain wou'd he give some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; any thing; every thing to Redeem his lost Soul: But, alas! <hi>So Precious is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of his Soul, that it ceases for ever,</hi> Psal. XLIX. 8. What is an empty, troublesome, perishing World, compared with an heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, spiritual, immortal Soul? Tis lighter than the small dust of the Balance: And how is it possible then, that such a light aery Nothing should be a Gain equivalent to the Loss of a weighty Soul? There is no propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all between them.</p>
            <p>In short; Will Divine <hi>Justice</hi> be Pleased with this, &amp; for the sake of it release the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in Chains, from Eternal Darkness and Misery?</p>
            <p>Will the Son of God be Contented, that he that slighted the infinitely valuable Price of His Blood, which was offered to Ransom him from going down into the Pit; I say, that <hi>he</hi> should be rescued from that Torment, which is his due, by the mean inconsiderable Bauble of a World? No certainly; Tis not such <hi>Corruptible things as Silver and Gold,</hi>
               <note n="(a)" place="bottom">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 18.</note>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:001538_0036_0FB3AC8CAC05E5C0"/>
that can <hi>Redeem</hi> a Soul; <hi>Burnt-offerings, and Calves of a year old, thousands of Rams, and ten thousands of rivers of Oyl,</hi> 
               <note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Mic.</hi> vi. 6,7.</note> would not appease the Divine displeasure, and prevail with God to release him.</p>
            <p>Besides; If the World were sufficient to give in Exchange, he has it not now to give: Upon the moment of his entring into the Valley of the Shadow of Death, he <hi>Lost the World,</hi> which he tho't he had Gained, as well as his Soul; and now has not the least pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of it left to Comfort him in his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery.</p>
            <p>Nay further; if it were possible for God to say to him, Be as thou wilt; he is now become so much of a Devil, that he wou'd be his own Tormentor: for God he <hi>cou'd</hi> not Choose; and he <hi>wou'd</hi> never be able to get from under the lively apprehensions of what he has lost.</p>
            <p>Oh, then! What an Unprofitable Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain do they make of it, who lose their Souls, for a World; who, for the sake of Gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Sensual Appetites, carry Fire in their Bosoms, and Court Everlasting Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>

               <p>Hence we may see something of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>Sinfulness of Sin;</hi> which has Debased, and Wrong'd so Noble a thing as the Soul of Man is. The Soul is of a Divine Extraction and Original; Glorious in its Make and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments; and it argues the Vileness of Sin, that it has sunk the Soul below its Original Dignity, Weakned its Powers, Slurr'd its Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre, and Cloath'd it with the most ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious tokens of Slavery. For, the greater is the Mischief done, the viler is the Cause of it. Tis Sin that has bro't all the Mischief upon the Soul: Tis this has clipt its Wings, and clog'd it from soaring to its Native Heaven; hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders its delightful Converse with Angels, and its Eternal Father; keeps it grov'ling in the Dust, like a Beast; and has brought it under the Government of the Senses. Tis this has fill'd it with Principles of Rebellion, made it a Traitor to its Rightful Sovereign, engag'd it in a Conspiracy against its own Life, and entail'd upon it Wounds, Bruises, and putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Sores.</p>
               <p>Tis this has procured it a Sentence of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Banishment from God, the immense

Fountain of Blessedness; and has Damn'd it to the lowest Misery, where the smoke of her Torment ascendeth for ever and ever. So does <hi>he that Sinneth, wrong his own Soul,</hi> Prov. VIII. 36. Which argues the heinous and vile Nature of Sin; and should provoke us to loath and abhor it.</p>

               <p>Is the Gain of the World so small a thing as we have seen, then, how mightily are they <hi>Deceived,</hi> who expect <hi>Great things</hi> from it? Here lies our great Mistake: while we are in pursuit of the World, we view it through a Magnifying Glass; and pleasing our selves with its mighty appearance, forget to make al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances for the encrease of its Dimensions; hence our hopes are raised, and we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect great things from it. We form our Schemes according to our present Sight of it, and so enlarge our desires, and quicken our endeavours to Gain it. But when we come to bring it near, and take a closer View of it, without those deceitful Glasses, (like some Paintings that appear beautiful in a proper distance, so) its glory vanishes, and we behold it in all its imperfection. Where is the man, that by indulging his Sensual Appetites, and following after his Pleasures, ever found that
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:001538_0039_0FB3AC912BF134E0"/>
in them which he expected? As his hopes and expectations were great, so is the trick and cheat that is put upon him, when he finds, that notwithstanding its fair Shew and Promises, tis all like <hi>Eve's</hi> Apple, false and deadly within. He will as certainly find himself deceived, as the Sensualist in the Gospel, <note n="(a)" place="bottom">

And what is and the affliction and sorrow the Body is liable to, compared with the endless Torments of a lost Soul? Tis the loss of the Soul, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves

               <p>Briefly;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Be <hi>Moderate</hi> with respect to the things of this World. Bring your Appetites and Desires under a good Regulation; that you mayn't be hurry'd away by the vehemence of your own cravings. Seek not great things for your selves: For the more moderate your Desires are, the freer will you be from the Influence and power of the world, and the less Danger will there be of your losing your Souls to gain it. Let your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours after the things of the world be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate too: for he that pursues the world with all eagerness, is continually liable to fall. This is the Holy Apostle's advice, Phil. IV. 9. <hi>Let your Moderation be known unto all Men.</hi> It becomes those that call themselves Christians, to let all Men see that they are not the Men of this world who have their Portion in this life only, by being Moderate in their desires and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours after it. Tis the inordinate Cares of this Life, that Eat out the heart of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and choak the good Seed; but it your Appetites and Pains are kept within due limits, the world is not like to fasten
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:001538_0045_0FB3AC9C8D299160"/>
upon you, Ben't therefore anxiously care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful what you shall Eat, or what you shall Drink, or what you shall put on; for your Heavenly Father knoweth what you need of these things: But acknowledge the Divine Government by a suitable Quietness of mind, and Acquiescence in your Portion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By no means <hi>Allow</hi> of any <hi>Known Sin,</hi> for the sake of the World. Whatever form and address the world may appear to you in be not allured, or forced by it, to commit a known Trespass upon the Law of God: But say with good <hi>Joseph,</hi> Gen. XXXIX. 9. <hi>How shall I do this great Wickedness, and Sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God?</hi> You must therefore take special Care, that you use no Unrighteous Methods to Gain the World; that you don't injurious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take from your Neighbour, what you have no Right to; that you don't Cheat and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, in your Business and Dealings with him; that you don't impose upon his Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; nor oppress him under his Necessities; nor use such Knavish Shuffling Tricks, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance your Secular interest, as are the Shame of a Christian, and the Bane of humane Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. You must also take Care, that you don't forfeit your Word, or, break your Trust; tho' you might have never so great an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by it, to enlarge your Possessions. For such things as these will argue, that your
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:001538_0046_0FB3AC9DEC8892E0"/>
hearts are set upon this world, and will bar your entring into the Kingdom of Heaven: For no <hi>Unrighteous Person shall inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. VI. 9.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let not the Cares of this World <hi>Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> your Attendance upon any <hi>known Duty.</hi> You will find very much of the Policy of the world lies here, so to possess your Minds with the Cares of this Life, how you shall be Provided for, how you shall go through this Difficulty, or be able to accomplish this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking; I say, its design is, by filling your Minds with such Cares, to jostle all sober thoughts of God, and your own Souls, out of your hearts, and so to prevent your Attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon those Religious Duties, which are the only proper Methods of Gain to your Souls. You must therefore be careful, that you omit no Duty for the sake of the World. Don't suffer the hurry of your Business, to hinder you from such Publick Worship of God, as you might conveniently enough attend upon: And to be sure, let it not defraud you of the Duties of your Families, and the Secret and Retired Devotion you owe to God and your own Souls. When Religious Duties, and Worldly Business seem to interfere, imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Examine, which is the present Necessary Duty? and that that must be attended now, or not at all, let the other give place to: And tho' the affairs of this world, may sometimes
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:001538_0047_0FB3AC9F70E9B2B0"/>
necessitate your Religious Duties to give place for a few Minutes; yet they can't make it necessary, that you wholly neglect them. And if you do; you will Starve your Souls, to Feed your Bodies. This was their Bane, whom our Saviour invited to the <hi>Wedding Dinner,</hi> one had his <hi>Farm,</hi> another <hi>his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise</hi> to mind, <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>they made light of it, and went their way,</hi> Mat. XXII. 5.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Watch and Pray</hi> against Temptations from this World. When Our Saviour bid His Disciples take heed, that their hearts be not overcharged with Surfeiting and Drunkenness, and the Cares of this Life; He immediately adds, <hi>Watch ye therefore, and Pray alwayes,</hi> Luke. XXI. 36. You will find the world to be full of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. There are the lusts of the Flesh, the lusts of the Eye, and the Pride of Life, which make head with their numerous hosts under their Command, and fiercely assault the Soul: And you had need therefore be upon your Watch and Guard, that they mayn't take you at Unawares, &amp; surprize you in their Snares.</p>
               <p>And thus you must <hi>Pray</hi> against them as well as Watch: and that not only in the common course of your Devotion; but as you find Temptations to arise: at least by short &amp; pathetical Ejaculations, to
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:001538_0048_0FB3ACA14103F2E0"/>
crave the Divine Assistance against them. For this is the holy Breath of the Soul which blasts the designs of the world. This carries the Soul into the Heavenly World, takes a view of the Entertainments of it, and so keeps her out of the reach of this World. This will gain the assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Great Captain of your Salvation, who will not suffer you to be Tempted, above what you are able.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Lastly, Improve</hi> what you Enjoy of this World to the <hi>Best</hi> Ends and Purposes. We are advised, 1 Cor. X. 31. <hi>Whether ye Eat, or Drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the Glory of God.</hi> You must take care, that you don't Dishonour the Name of God, by gratifying only your Sensual appeties, and Consuming upon your Lusts, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of this World, which He fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours you with: but you must endeavour, to make all that you have subservient to this great End, The Glory of God: For this is the End for which you were made, and have the lower streams of His good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness flowing down to you. Let therefore a suitable Portion of your worldly Interest, be more peculiarly devoted to His Service, that all the rest may be Sanctified to your use and improvement. Works of Piety and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; the promoting and maintaining the
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:001538_0049_0FB3ACA269306F00"/>
Honour of God, in His House and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; and the relieving the wants of the Indigent, &amp; Distressed; demand a Portion of your worldly Estate; and you must not withhold your hands therefrom, <hi>To Do Good, and to Communicate, forget not,</hi> Heb. XIII. 16. By this means, instead of Losing your Souls, to Gain the World, you will further their Welfare, by a wise Improvement of these things; and make to your selves Friends of the Mammon of Unrighteousness, that when they fail you, you may be received into Everlasting Habitations.</p>
               <p>These short Rules well observed, you will wisely guard against the Hazzards and Danger, you are exposed to from the World.</p>

               <p>Let us all then be Exhorted to a <hi>Just Concern for our Immortal Souls;</hi> and make their Safety and Welfare the First and Chief of our Cares. We are ready enough to take care of our Bodies, to Feed, to Cloathe, to Beautify, and Preserve them Healthy; to repair the Injuries that may be done them, by Distempers, or Accidents; and see that they want nothing Necessary, or that may be Convenient. But we have immortal Souls within us, of infinitely greater Worth
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:001538_0050_0FB3ACA7A5327600"/>
and Value, which earnestly demand our Care; whose Safety is of the last importance to us. Well then, Let us not be Deaf to their Cries, but let them have the <hi>First</hi> of our Care; left the prepossessions of the World clap a strong Bias upon us, and having been used to indulge our selves in its Vanities, and Gaities, its Sinful Delights and Pleasures, we find it hard to shake off a contracted Habit; and turn the current of our Affections into a new Channel: left we Slip the Opportunity of Recovering them, and too late would give any thing in Exchange for them; but find 'em irrecoverably gone. <hi>Seek first the Kingdom of God and His Righteousness,</hi> was our Blessed Saviour's Advice; with an Assurance, that <hi>all these things,</hi> (a Sufficiency of them,) <hi>shall be added,</hi> Mat. VI. 33.</p>
               <p>And let them have the <hi>Chief</hi> of our Care also. They certainly deserve it: and the greatness of the Work, and difficulty of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing their Welfare, renders it necessary to bend our whole Force, and use our closest Applications; and that all other Affairs be engaged in, as tho' we engaged not, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of them. For tis no easie matter to Work out our Salvation: it must be done with Fear and Trembling; and it requires <hi>all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to make our Calling and Election sure.</hi>

            <head>For Direction.</head>
            <p>First; <hi>Put on the Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> Thus we are called upon, Rom. XIII. 14. <hi>Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the Flesh, to fulfil the Lusts thereof.</hi> Receive the Reports of the Gospel, and Christ Jesus, who is therein offered to us, as the alone Saviour of a lost Soul. Look upon His Obedience and Passion as our only Propitiatory Sacrifice; and humbly Plead it with the Eternal Father, for the Remission of our Sins, and our Acceptance with God: and commit our Spirits into His Hands, as the Lord God of Truth, who hath Redeemed them, by an intire Dependance upon Him, for all that Salvation which He hath Purchased for us. So let us lift up the everlasting Doors, that That King of Glory may come, and <hi>dwell in our Hearts by Faith</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Eph. iii. 17.</hi>
               </note> So will the Image of God be pourtrayed a new upon us, in bright and lively Characters, the Enmity between us will be Slain, and we shall be <hi>made nigh by the Blood of Christ</hi> 
               <note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Eph. ii. 13.</hi>
               </note>: And this will be the most effectual Method, to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our Souls from the Tyranny of an Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping World. For, <hi>who is he that overcometh the World, but he that Believeth, that Jesus is the Son of God?</hi> 1 Joh.V.5.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="unknown:001538_0052_0FB3ACAC44BD1AB0"/>Again; <hi>Grow in Grace.</hi> Thus are we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised, 2 Pet. III. 18. <hi>Grow in Grace, and in the Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.</hi> Let us not rest contented with feeding upon the husks of this world, but reach after the Food of Angels, the Flagons and Apples of the Sanctuary, the Graces of the Holy Spirit of God. See to it, that all Old things are done away, and that all things are become New in your Souls; and to one Grace and Vertue add another, and never come to a stand, as tho' you had already attained, but still press forward, from one degree of Grace to another, till you come to appear in strength before God in <hi>Zion.</hi> For this is the Food &amp; Nourishment of the Soul, which only can support the proper Life of it: And by this means, we shall come to have our Conversation in Heaven, while we are upon Earth, and so live above this World; and be enabled to Contemn its Glory, as not worth our Regarding.</p>
            <p>Finally; Let us <hi>Lay up our Treasure in the Heavenly World.</hi> This is our Saviour's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, <hi>Luk.XII.33. Provide for your selves Bags that wax not old, a Treasure in the Heavens, that faileth not.</hi> There is a Treasure worth our seeking after: There are durable Riches &amp; Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Prov. viii. 18.</note>; there are <hi>Rivers of Pleasures and
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:001538_0053_0FB3ACADB338BB60"/>
Fulness of Joys at God's Right Hand</hi>

                  <hi>Psal.</hi>xvi. II. &amp; xxxvi. 8.</note>; and a a <hi>Crown of Glory that fadeth not away</hi>

                  <hi>I Pet. v. 4.</hi>
               </note>. This is a Treasure every way suitable to a spiritual &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Soul, agreeable to its Nature, &amp; answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to its Wants &amp; Desires; large as our wishes, and exceeding our most raised expectations; which no Enemy can spoil us of, nor the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Duration run it dry. For God is an inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haustible Fountain, and when He becomes all in all to the Soul, tho' the Springs of Nature may fail, yet He will remain the Strength of our heart &amp; our Portion for ever. Here then let us lay up our Treasure; and having our Treasure in Heaven, let our Hearts be there also: and then when our Souls shall be <hi>Uncloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, our earthly House of this Tabernacle shall be dissolved,</hi> we shall not be <hi>Naked</hi> &amp; Destitute; but provided with <hi>a Building of God, an House not made with Hands, Eternal in the Heavens.</hi> See 2 Cor. V. 1,2.</p>
            <p>Let it be as Motive to us, to Excite us to this Prudent Care of our Souls; To Consider the <hi>Possibility</hi> of Saving them. If it were a thing impossible, who wou'd take any Pains about it? But this is possible, through Divine Goodness. God has begun this work for us, has laid the Foundation of it in infinite Grace and Love; He has sent His Only Begotten
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:001538_0054_0FB3ACAF44FA3350"/>
Son to Redeem and Save us; has Published to us these Glad Tidings of Great Joy, that to Us there is Born a Saviour, Christ the Lord; and He is waiting upon us, with the repeated Offers of His Grace, and the Stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings of His Holy Spirit with us, to carry on this Work in our Souls. Well then; Since it is a day of Grace and a time of Love, let none of us forsake our own Mercies, and follow after lying Vanities; let us be stirred up to improve the Opportunity, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage we have in our hands; and know the things of our Peace, in this the Day thereof, e're they are hidden from our Eyes.</p>

            <p>Consider the Vast <hi>Consequence</hi> of determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning your Choice <hi>Wisely Now;</hi> for you do it for Eternity. When once Death has laid us in the Grave, there will be no Knowledge, Work, nor Device for us there. What we do for the Salvation of our Souls must be done immediately: for we know not how soon the Midnight Cry may be heard; Come away. Let this Excite us, to hearken to the Gracious Offers made us from the Third Heavens, and Comply with the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging Address of that World we now stand Probationers for; and then the Salvation of
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:001538_0055_0FB3ACB0AB7BCE30"/>
our Souls will be established, as the everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mountains, and the perpetual Hills; and 'twill be their Glory to Shine Brighter than the Sun in the Firmament of God; the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diant Lustre whereof shall Shine around our Bodies, while we Joyn with the Holy Choir of Perfected Spirits, who surround the Throne of the Lamb, Singing, Alleluia! Salvation, Glory, Honour, and Power be unto the Lord our God.</p>
