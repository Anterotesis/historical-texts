            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>YEARS are paſt ſince firſt you beſtrid the hobbies ſilk and wine, which ſeem to be in full career; and ſorry I am to ſee ſuch ſpeed, for aught that appears, without any previous conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the effects they may be attended with to the community, in an extenſive view. I applaud the endeavours of your Philoſophical Society, in general; but in this particular, wiſh ſome leſs miſchievous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject had flattered their attention. In a converſation at Bath, when I was laſt there, it was ſaid they are excellent objects to employ our coloniſts in; for, ſilk and wine will come to us from our plantations, upon much eaſier terms than we now obtain them; and in a little time we ſhall be able to ſpare a part of them to the European Countries that at preſent ſupply us. The plantations cannot ſell to any other than our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:014896_0003_0F973F5148CE4D90"/>therefore, we ſhall have their wine and ſilk upon our own terms, and be able to underſell our neighbours in Europe, ſo as to render it not worth their while to make them. <note n="*" place="bottom">Should this be accompliſhed, inſtead of wine they would make grain; which would render them leſs dependent upon others, and we in particular ſhould loſe the demand for our beſt article of export.</note> Much more paſt that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected me greatly; rather on behalf of your children than yourſelves; who, it may be, ſhall have ſcuffled through life ere the fatal effects of your policy, in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing the ſilken cord and luſcious draught, from your once better employed fields, ſhall be fully felt: and I plainly perceived, rather indeed from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timations than from any direct diſcourſe, that the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans are to be drawn, by degrees. into an humble ſtate of dependence and ſubmiſſion abſolute, by ſuch employments as may divert them from a prudent and due attention to the raiſing <hi>neceſſaries.</hi>
                  </p>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the readineſs with which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for making wine and ſilk have been received by the numerous claſs of wine drinkers, and fond ones for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty, I, though a wine drinker, have not yet been able to reconcile them to my poor judgment; however faſhionable it may have been to embrace and promote them. On the contrary, ſome reflections in conſequence of the hints in the foregoing extract, have determined me, with a view to the public permanent happineſs, to declare my diſapprobation of them.</p>
            <p>It is a principle of ſound prudence, whenever in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of government, law and commerce, any material alteration is propoſed, that you beware of latent conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quencies—be jealous of <hi>new</hi> eſtabliſhments—look forward, and conſider how flattering ſoever appearances are, what probably may be the miſchievous tendency
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:014896_0004_0F973F527B7D0100"/>of ſuch new <note n="†" place="bottom">"It is not eaſy to determine, upon theory, the ſucceſs of political innovations." PRINC. P. L.</note> projects when adopted. It is often better to drudge on in a temperate and middle ſtate, than to aim at too much.</p>
            <p>The propoſed cultivations are intended to introduce wine and ſilk as an American ſtaple; and ſhould the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt be crowned with ſucceſs, their produce may, for a while, yield conſiderable profit to individuals; provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the hand of power ſhould not by impoſts, or ſome other way, clogg and burden it. That there is at leaſt one other way, my friend has ſhewn by the intimation, that our Engliſh brethren would tie us up from ſelling to any but themſelves, as is actually the caſe of tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, and many other articles of American land produce, which are already heavily burthened with duties in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. We have no aſſurance it would not be clogged; and if we had, it might become a queſtion how far thoſe who have recently committed repeated breaches of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic faith, are entitled to our confidence, in a matter of ſo great importance as the parting with what is eſſential to our being.</p>
            <p>The firſt and great eſſential in life is <hi>bread.</hi> When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we ſhall ſurrender that—throw away the ſickle for the pruning knife and ſilk reel; for the making fine wines and fine ſilk materials for our taſk-maſters, that they may more readily beſot and bedeck themſelves; and in the end, through our pinching neceſſities, which muſt follow, govern us with a bit of bread, then may they tax at pleaſure and command like true muſſelmen. We ſhould have but little ſpirits to claim, much leſs ſupport conſtitutional rights, and it would be as ridiculous to talk of them, as it would be for the meagre Spaniard or Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, who, with their bunnel and huſks of grapes, are juſt enabled to drudge through a dark, dull, ſlaviſh life.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014896_0005_0F973F5334EEF2F8"/>Unfortunate brethren! to be thus deluded and debaſed by the arts of tyranny.</p>
            <p>Being, from ſuch a ſurrender, reduced to want bread, how could our dejected minds contradict or diſobey the moſt oppreſſive mandates of a Grand Vizier? I would ſuppoſe that with our ſilk and wine we have, like the poor peaſants of South Europe, made ſome bread: but our labour and attention being, by the artifices of thoſe called politicians (too often enemies to plain honeſty and liberal ſentiment) <hi>diverted,</hi> more eſpecially to the purpoſe of raiſing <hi>luxuries,</hi> which will neither ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feed or cloath us, we have, alas! only aimed at a ſcanty ſtock of grain, barely for our reſpective country family's conſumption, and falling a little ſhort in that, become miſerably dependent on ſtrangers <note n="*" place="bottom">Italy formerly exported corn; but afterwards became <hi>depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent on other countries for its daily bread:</hi> This is aſcribed by the Roman authors to the <hi>neglect of tillage.</hi>

                  <q>We can have no wheat ſo good as our own, although as good may be ſhipped from abroad. By a ſea carriage it is liable to many accidents.

            <p>In the war immediately preceeding the laſt. France, in the midſt of almoſt uninterrupted victories and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, whilſt her labor and attention were much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged by wine and ſilk, was compelled to make peace,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014896_0007_0F973F54AD0D0138"/>and relinquiſh all her fine proſpects, merely from a great <hi>ſcarcity of corn</hi> in that kingdom: when her enemies had only the barren iſland of Cape Briton to deliver up in exchange; whereas it might well be thought that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draſs alone, then in her hands, was an equivalent. Ever ſince that ſore-felt ſcarcity, it has been her policy to encourage the making of corn, preferable to all other produce; ſeeing and feeling, as we may ſuppoſe, that however great or flouriſhing they may be in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, <hi>bread being wanting ſubmiſſion muſt follow.</hi> This is an axiom applicable to individuals as well as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces and kingdoms<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <q>After the battle of Blenheim, the French army wanted large recruits, and there being a great ſcarcity of bread in the country, the French King ordered his public ſtores of bread to be well taken care of. The ſoldiers alone were well fed out of them; whilſt the country people were ſtarving, which occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned them, through <hi>neceſſity,</hi> to flock to the army and inliſt in crouds.</q> 
                  <bibl>2 <hi>Ha. Hus.</hi> 338.</bibl> Here then, we have an inſtance of the application to private, as the text is of a public <hi>ſubmiſſion for want of bread,</hi> and that too in the ſame country.</note>.</p>
            <p>A celebrated author reckons it bad policy in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh to obſtruct the uſe of French wines: and would <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage</hi> the French <hi>to turn their labor</hi> to the making more wines, by the free uſe of them in England; becauſe each new acre of vineyard planted in France, in order to ſupply England with wine, would make it requiſite for the French to take the produce of an Engliſh acre ſown in wheat, in order to ſubſiſt themſelves: "and it is evident, that we have thereby got the command of the better commodity." Apply this to the <hi>lure</hi> now hung out to America<note n="‡" place="bottom">Hints and intimations were thrown out, from England, of immenſe riches to America, ſhould ſhe employ her attention in making wine and ſilk. Such a ſpirit as James I. attempted to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe in the minds of the Engliſh nation, was now to be caught by the Americans.—But they are employments equally inconſiſtent with the genius of this people as of that, and it is hoped that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will lead this manly people into ſo dangerous an employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Like their Engliſh anceſtors, they are too wiſe and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate to enter into ſuch an effeminate baſineſs as ſilk making eſpecially.
<p>In the time of the ſame James of England, the ſilk raiſed in France, yielded ſuch an immenſe <hi>apparent</hi> profit, that our effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate King repeatedly recommended it from the throne, to raiſe Silk worms in England: But the nation was too prudent to be influenced to it by the Royal recommendation, although it was, perhaps, more earneſtly preſſed by him and his ſervants than any other matter—even by the judges on the circuits, however fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign to their office: and there could be no doubt of the Silk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm thriving and working as well in England as in other parts of Europe; as appeared by many experiments, beſides what are recorded by the Philoſophical Society, in their tranſactions. It was not many years ere that brilliant buſineſs began to decline greatly in France, where it is now quite trifling compared with its then vaſt extent; for "the profit being <hi>little elſe than apparent,</hi> was not realized." Why did England reject the Royal ſcheme, for making her rich?—It was againſt the genius of a free and manly people.—An employment fitted only to an effeminate and poor ſpirited people. Hence we may obſerve that, all the world over, the making of ſilk moſtly flouriſhes among people of that ſtamp, who are every where in a ſtate of miſerable oppreſſion or ſlavery. The very nature of the employment tends to enervate that hardineſs and vigour, which is the general effect of manly labour, and to effeminate the nation that unhappily ſtumbles on it.</p>
               </note>. Why would our countrymen on the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:014896_0008_0F973F556F1B0560"/>other ſide the water, coax us to drudge in articles on which we may ſtarve? Have we any reaſon to conclude, eſpecially from the preſent Aſiatic temper of their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers that there is in the project the leaſt regard for our welfare? Rather may we not ſuppoſe that the <hi>benevolent</hi> motive is pointed out above, by Mr. Hume; when, what he would that England ſhould do by her implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enemy France, that ſhe would now do by us;—ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jole us out of the <hi>command of the better commodity, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to our exiſtence,</hi> and make it requiſite for us to take
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:014896_0009_0F973F5625E700C0"/>the product of <hi>her acres</hi> of WHEAT, in order to ſubſiſt ourſelves<note n="*" place="bottom">If from their exceſſive luxury and their endleſs manufacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, conſumers of bread among them, ſhould be in too great proportion to their corn-makers, for theſe to ſupply them and us alſo with wheat, yet the ſubjecting us to a dependence on them for bread, would be anſwered by foreign wheat, purchaſed and ſent to us in their ſhips, They have been uſed to buy of us, to ſend to foreigners; why not buy of other foreigners to ſell to us? They are not to be deterred by the price to be given, whilſt we muſt buy of them at any rate.</note>. He further ſays, there <q>are many edicts of the French King, prohibiting the planting new vineyards, and ordering thoſe lately planted to be grubbed up; ſo ſenſible are they of the <hi>ſuperior value of corn above every other product.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Let it not be ſaid, I am ſo extravagant as to contend we ſhould be wholly employed in making corn, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe: it would be a deſign too unnatural for any le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative authority to enforce. My meaning is, that we <hi>drop not, nor even relax from, the ſtaff of life:</hi>—that we ſo far attend to raiſing, within ourſelves, a plenty of heart-cheering ſubſiſtence, as to make luxuries and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies ſubſervient to it; and not that any of the <hi>neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> our firſt care, ſhould depend <hi>on them.</hi> I am, too, for preſerving the connection with Great-Britain. But it may be expected ſhe will allow us to be men who have rights; and having feelings, ſuch as ſhe once had, that ſhe will forbear to play the tyrant over us Let Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, when her conſtitutional freedom ſhall be <hi>ſecured,</hi> ſupport the true intereſts of her parent: She is old, drinks hard, and her conſtitution is much impaired; and having litigious neighbours, let us exert ourſelves in her defence, not barely in proportion to her ſickly ſtate, but to her juſtice and public virtue; and let affection accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany it—when poſſible! Let the commerce between us be ſo regulated, that whilſt we render her raw materials
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:014896_0010_0F973F584C14D1B8"/>for her manufactories, ſhe grudge us not an independent ſecurity of our property, and ſuch a ſhare of foreign commerce as will enable us to pay for thoſe materials returned to us manufactured for uſe, burthened, as they would be, with the internal taxes of England, and with the high profits neceſſary to ſupport the luxurious living of Meſſieurs the merchants, the mariners, gentlemen—tradeſmen, gentlemen ſcavengers, and other gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, down to the ſhoe black—If this be denied to us, then it becomes not our choice but neceſſity, to diſuſe her wrought-goods, and to manufacture the raw mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials for our neceſſary occaſions; further I hope we ſhall not attempt. It is not the proper buſineſs of an infant country to engage in the manufacturing materials <hi>for ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of commerce.</hi> We want lands cleared and improved. The moſt natural, moſt advantageous article of trade, to us, is the produce of our farms; which ought of choice to conſiſt in neceſſaries; <hi>corn, cattle, wool, hemp, flax, ſaltpetre,</hi> &amp;c.—Let theſe, and ſuch like, be our ſtaple of commerce; and let even the wool, hemp, and flax go in groſs to England, ſo long as ſhe will leave to us a trade elſewhere open to enable us to buy her wrought wares. When this regulation, ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to the Mother Country, is refuſed, if we have been ſo provident as to have made neceſſaries our ſtaple, we ſhall have the comfort to find our hands full of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials for our own neceſſary conſumption — I ſhould ſay ſalvation! with theſe we may be warm and robuſt, which with wine and ſilk alone we cannot. Here then is an advantage in chooſing the "better commodities" for ſtaples of trade, in attempting to raiſe all we can, a ſafe game is played: we have a moral certainty of our real wants being ever ſupplied; and, generally, if not at all times, there will be a <hi>ſurpluſage of thoſe neceſſaries to exchange with others for their delicacies and luxuries,</hi> whereby our imaginary or artificial wants would alſo be gratified.—Nor am I indifferent to a glaſs of good wine:
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:014896_0011_0F973F5B03C8B060"/>I admire, and am ſeldom without it; but it is obtained in a way that America ought only to get it; by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and exchange of a <hi>ſurpluſage of neceſſaries</hi> for that delicious juice.</p>
            <p>Should I ever be without ſuch ſurpluſage, which has not yet been the caſe (for my ground yields abundant corn!) then I ſhall only miſs of, for a time, what I can always do without. Nor yet do I carry my objections ſo far, but that thoſe gentlemen who have the opportunity, may proceed in wine-making, for amuſement or for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily uſe: and even, ſhould the humour ſo run, for ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral internal conſumption: though, perhaps, it were better not carried ſo far as this, for fear we ſhould reach to exportation.</p>
            <p>The queſtion has been repeatedly aſked: "would you have every body make grain?" I have declared it cannot be; a law to that purpoſe would be as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous as inconſiſtent with the various diſpoſitions and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of men. And yet too much cannot be made. Mountains of grain would invite a market. But huſbandmen will in theſe caſes ever chooſe for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; all that I ſay is, let not our provincial legiſlators, or men of influence, miſlead the people, by encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of any ſort, to labour in making for the principle commodities, articles of luxury; but rather diſſuade them from it: and let the fat farmer be on his guard, nor part with his ſtaff, "the better commodity" for vines and worms<note n="§" place="bottom">It is not thirty years ſince wheat firſt became a conſiderable object of exportation, in Maryland; nor twenty ſince Virginia firſt attended to it. Before theſe times, acts of aſſembly were not unfrequent for prohibiting exportation of corn, from the ſcarcity of it to anſwer the neceſſary wants of the country; and ſo inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable was the quantity of wheat, and it was ſo unuſual to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it, that the prohibitory acts chiefly affected indian corn;—ſcarcely touching wheat. The people of theſe countries were then poor and ſpiritleſs to what they now are. Tobacco and indian corn, engroſſed the planters whole attention. Of tobacco, they conſtantly aimed at making all they could; all Dung was for to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco ground;—not a ſcrap for graſs or grain; their cattle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed were numerous; but being uſually hide-bound for want of food, made not <hi>much</hi> dung: They were apt to take an ugly diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the ſpring of the year;—they could not eat,—could not chew the cud—for want of food,—they died. Of corn the plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers aimed at making but little or no more than might ſuffice themſelves, their Negroes and beaſts: more would interfere with the quantity of tobacco.—So would wheat interfere with wine, and wine with wheat. What of their corn they had to ſpare—it was but ſometimes, and ſeldom much, was purchaſed with a little rum:—The tobacco, by Engliſh or Scotch ſtores of dry goods; or it was ſhipt in driblets, to London, on conſignment, the planters receiving returns according to the cunning of their factors there. But ſo much was ſold in the country to thoſe ſtores, or rather bartered for family neceſſaries, and too often for luxuries, that many planters, at the end of the year, had nothing they could call their own, except their lands and utenſils of huſbandry; and not always theſe. They were ſtrictly delvers,—planters for Britain;—always in debt, year over year;—begging indulgence,—cringing for more credit, and humbling themſelves before foreign factors, and their boys;—who being birds of paſſage had no feelings for the intereſts of the country—they rather poiſoned the minds of the planters from behind their counters, with principles and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions inimical to American rights and the planters own intereſts, in favour of that people—that paliament—which was to ſecond the views of thoſe very factors and the Britiſh merchants as often as they ſhould call for aid, to facilitate their deſigned advantages over the planters—"our planters"—as they call the Americans. It was a ſtriking inſtance of wheat being the "better commodity," that, as the cultivation of it advanced among us, the demand, and of courſe the price, increaſed: and whilſt, by its means, the upper counties of Maryland were enjoying plenty, and a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful independence, being emancipated from the tobacco ſtores, the lower counties, ſtill continued for years, the cringing mortgagers to Britiſh merchants; and, perhaps, are not quite clear of them, in ſome counties, at this day. Thus, as the progreſs of wheat making travelled ſouthward, the people became daily more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in their ſentiments, manner of life, and independency. Between tobacco and hemp—how great the contraſt! Tobacco, a <hi>luxury.</hi> hemp, a <hi>neceſſary,</hi> in univerſal demand! It is in theſe, and in every ſenſe the planter and politician can examine it, "the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter commodity."—for private, and for public advantage!</note>.</p>

It is ſaid that ſilk would be moſtly womens work. 'Tis true; but, if our wives and daughters were to raiſe as
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:014896_0013_0F973F5CECBE3940"/>much ſilk as would, from its high price, purchaſe a plenty of cloathing and food, the men, after a while, would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly become idle and indifferent to any other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce; our lands would be but little, if at all, cultivated and improved and the women performing, within a few weeks, the buſineſs of raiſing worms, would become equaly lazy and worthleſs for the reſt of the year;—and, by degrees, both men and women would be ignorant of huſbandry and houſewifery. Nor could their ſilk more readily purchaſe neceſſaries and all we ſhould want, than money would. Suppoſe then mountains of guineas open to all the people of this country with which they ſhould <hi>purchaſe</hi> what at preſent they labour in the fields to make: Can any be at a loſs to conceive the wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and dependency in which a country of people, ſo circumſtanced, would preſently be plunged! how to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ignorant the next generation, of agriculture, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and the arts. "The riches and ſafety of a country conſiſt not alone in the number of its inhabitants, but of thoſe <hi>well employed.</hi>" Look to Spain — to New Spain and its rich mines;—ſee the crawling ignorant Spaniard!—our oppreſſed, neceſſitous, and unhappy neighbours!</p>
            <p>It it probable, that in another century, ſilk, with other fine materials, and even manufactured goods, will be articles of commerce, from the mountaineers, back of Carolina, and other places, far from navigation, and not bulky, cheap and heavy articles, becauſe of a long
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:014896_0014_0F973F5DB3B35230"/>land carriage; whilſt all heavy, groſs, and cheap articles; will be from the countries moſt convenient to navigation: of which corn is one, as being too heavy for its price, to bear a very diſtant land carriage. Let us then, for as yet we have little elſe improved than the maritime coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, retain our bulky produce of <hi>neceſſaries,</hi> for the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of commerce. The more bulky, the better for the country exporting it; becauſe it employs more labour and ſhipping; Wheat is therefore better than ſilk, as well as for the before mentioned reaſons. Tobacco (although a luxury by the bye) is better than the luxury furr,—rice better than indigo.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the chief export produce of the maritime country between Connecticut and James river, will be wheat and flour;—of the Carolinas, Georgia and the Floridas, rice;—Maſſachuſſetts, and other parts of New-England, fiſh, cattle, and horſes;—the Miſſiſippi, lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, iron, and hemp—in ſhips built there.</p>
            <p>As to the ſucceſs of the preſent deſign of raiſing ſilk, I am not without hope, it will fail in Pennſylvania, as it has in Carolina and Georgia, notwithſtanding the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry uſed to induce the country people to bend their attention to it. The Carolinas went heartily to work to enrich themſelves, <hi>in a hurry</hi> by making ſilk; but in fourteen years they exported only 251lb. of raw ſilk; and in the ſame time imported the extravagant quantity of 26781lb. wrought for apparel. This I take from a ſtate of Carolina publiſhed in London, in 1761, which ſeems to be the production of a Governor of that colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. I hope the following reflection of his will not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable, although ſomewhat foreign: <q>I cannot help expreſſing my ſurprize and concern, to find that there are annually imported into this province, conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble quantities of Flanders lace, the fineſt Dutch linens and French Cambricks, chintzes, hyſon tea, and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:014896_0015_0F973F5E68550708"/>other goods, ſilk, gold and ſilver lace, &amp;c. by which means we are kept in low circumſtances, and though it may have the appearance of being for the preſent, beneficial to the Britiſh merchants, yet it retards our increaſe, both in people and wealth, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renders us leſs profitable to Great-Britain; for the riches of all colonies, muſt at length center in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-country.</q>

            <p>It is ſaid, in all countries there are ſpots of land too poor for any other cultivation than the vine:—and that it is the caſe in the colonies: I can only declare. I know of no ſuch ſoil in our America I affirm, there is no ſoil ſuitable to the vine, that will not produce ſome other <hi>more neceſſary</hi> plant. You have heard of this and that iſland, or part of ſome country, poor and rocky, producing delicious wine:—they are wine coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries;—countries, where that culture has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced by deſpotic influence, and is rivited on the backs of the miſerable inhabitants:—<hi>they want bread.</hi> There are other countries equally portion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with rocks and poverty of ſoil, in as good climates:—theſe produce no delicious wine—no wine at all, or none for exportation, but they yield the neceſſaries of life in greater abundance; <hi>they have bread!</hi> and enjoy ſome freedom—conſolation at leaſt The truth is, where, of lands very poor and rocky, you cannot cultivate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove one acre; of better, clear of rocks, you can cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate an hundred acres, or more; in this you ſow fields of grain; in the other you are confined from ſowing grain, ſufficient even for your little family's conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. You then look for a plant that will yield much of ſomething from little land:—this ſomething in your country, has hitherto, uſually been the grape. But the vine requires manure: it will not anſwer without it; and your acre of grapes requires as much labor and attention as the hundred acres of corn. If poor land is the beſt
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:014896_0016_0F973F5F263EAA28"/>for the vine, it is ſo only with the addition of good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure and the higheſt cultivation. Cultivate the pooreſt ground equally well, and look about for ſome plant of more neceſſary uſe:—ſuppoſe hemp, flax, graſs, cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, &amp;c. But why hazard the happineſs and independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the country, by introducing the vine culture, in order, niggardly, to diſturb the repoſe of a few acres of the very pooreſt land, when a vaſt continent teems with better!—Thouſands—millions of poor land lay waſte and uncultivated in the beſt countries of Europe, and of all the world; and in the leſs happier countries, millions of acres, better and more improveable, are equally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected.—If, ſtill, you are determined to cultivate the grape, for making wine, you will chooſe the land beſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted for it:—if the pooreſt is the beſt then cultivate it. But why wine? You want to be employed:—go then, to <hi>better lands;</hi>—there ſeek the <hi>"better commodity"</hi>—in the <hi>better employment!</hi> and take example by the ſufferings of a great nation!<note n="*" place="bottom">France, as well as other countries. See before.</note> Your taſte—teazes you to attempt the making wine:—indulge it!—But, as you will anſwer it to the neceſſitous huſbandmen, hereafter, lead not one mortal to delve in ſuch barren ſoil, in an employment only tending to bronze the voluptuous at their expence. Rather encourage them to avoid your taſte and be happy at home, admiſt a "plenty of wholſome food and decent cloathing," with their placid wives and roſy children, manufactoring all neceſſaries, <hi>under a depreſſed trade,</hi> within themſelves—ſparing to foreign countries the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſage of their GRAIN, their WOOL and HIMP;—BEST COMMODITIES!—ESSENTIALS OF DOMESTICK AND NATIONAL FELICITY!</p>
