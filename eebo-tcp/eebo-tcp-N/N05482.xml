            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>FOR the Sake of Thoſe who live at a Diſtance and knew not the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>following Tracts,</hi> I would obſerve; That he had his Education at <hi>Harvard-College,</hi> and ſtudied <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> and <hi>Phyſick,</hi> under his Uncle the Learned Dr. <hi>James Oliver</hi> of <hi>Cambridge;</hi> one of the moſt eſteemed <hi>Phyſicians</hi> in his Day; who had a ſingular Help in the Art of Chymiſtry by the ingenious Dr. <hi>Lodowick</hi> a <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> who was alſo accounted an excellent <hi>Phyſician,</hi> and the moſt ſkilful <hi>Chymiſt</hi> that ever came into theſe Parts of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</hi> And Dr. <hi>Williams</hi> lived and practiced in <hi>Boſton</hi> with great Succeſs and Reputation for near <hi>thirty ſeven</hi> Years, to the Time of his <hi>Death,</hi> which was on <hi>Jan.</hi> 10. 1737, 8, in the 63d Year of his Age.</p>
            <p>He was well vers'd in the moſt valued <hi>Authors,</hi> eſpecially thoſe who wrote on <hi>Experimental Caſes,</hi> carefully comparing them with <hi>his own Obſervations.</hi> He made the Caſe of his Patients as his own: and where he apprehended Danger, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied himſelf with great Concern and Diligence, and ſeem'd to bear them on his Mind continually. In ſome Caſes he has conſulted with Dr. <hi>Mead,</hi> and <hi>other principal Phyſicians</hi> in <hi>England</hi> for Advice and Help.</p>
            <p>In every thing he was exceeding <hi>Cautious;</hi> eſpecially in the Preparation of his <hi>more important Medicines</hi> for his own Practice, that he might more ſurely judge of their Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: And his eſtabliſhed Character for Piety, Skill and Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, made his Patients entirely ſatisfied in all his Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:006947_0003_102AD1C55DABFE38"/>
It was his Method to reduce to <hi>Writing</hi> the <hi>more remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Caſes</hi> with the various Symptoms occuring, and the Courſe he took; that he might form his own Practice in like Caſes afterwards. And by this Means we are favoured with the <hi>following Tracts;</hi> which appear to be wrote with great Judgment and Conciſeneſs; tho' without the leaſt Thought of their being ever publiſhed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>former</hi> Part ſeems to have been drawn up for <hi>ſome ſpecial Friend,</hi> by Way of Direction; the <hi>latter</hi> is a <hi>more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Account</hi> of <hi>his own Practice,</hi> in which the <hi>Preſcriptions</hi> are here rendred into <hi>Engliſh</hi> for their being of more extenſive Uſe.</p>
            <p>I hope this will ſuffice to recommend them to thoſe who were not acquainted with him: for as to thoſe who knew him, I apprehend it needleſs.</p>
            <p>In the little Knowledge I have of <hi>Phyſical Authors</hi> and of <hi>this Diſtemper,</hi> I cannot but judge <hi>theſe ſmall Tracts</hi> of <hi>great Value.</hi> And as my divine and merciful MASTER declared, that He came not to deſtroy Men's Lives, but to ſave them; and in tender Pity to all about Him, and a perfect Conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with his ſaving Office, employed his Power to <hi>heal</hi> their <hi>bodily</hi> as well as <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Maladies: I cannot but judge it conſiſtent with my <hi>Imitation</hi> of Him, to promote the Publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>this excellent Method</hi> of <hi>Healing,</hi> and recommend it to all around me. And in Hopes of its being a Mean in his Hand of ſaving the Lives of many, eſpecially in our <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Towns,</hi> as well as in <hi>This</hi> where the <hi>Phyſicians</hi> have not <hi>now</hi> Time to attend <hi>all</hi> the Sick; I humbly commit it to his ſovereign Bleſſing.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>To guard againſt the Infection</hi> and <hi>render the Diſtemper more favourable</hi> when it ſeizes; Let a <hi>Scruple</hi> of <hi>Brimſtone</hi> very finely powder'd be taken twice a Day; firſt in the <hi>Morning,</hi> and about ſix o'Clock at <hi>Night,</hi> in a <hi>Spoonful</hi> of <hi>Water;</hi> and drink after it 40 <hi>Drops</hi> of <hi>Elixir Proprietatis</hi> in a Glaſs of <hi>Water,</hi> or any generous <hi>Wine;</hi> or where <hi>that</hi>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>When the Symptoms</hi> of the <hi>Small Pox appear</hi> (which are very various, Pains in the Head, Back, Limbs, Stomach, Belly, Sickneſs &amp;c. with a Fever, which always accompanies what ever other Symptoms there are.)</p>
            <p>If <hi>now</hi> there be any Signs of a <hi>foul Stomach,</hi> or its being <hi>clogg'd with Phlegm;</hi> Let there be a <hi>Vomit</hi> given <hi>as ſoon as may</hi> be <hi>before the Eruption</hi> or Appearance of the Pock.

            </p>

            <p>
               <hi>To bring out the Pock,</hi> it is neceſſary that there be <hi>ſome Fever</hi> which muſt carefully be minded: If <hi>too high,</hi> it muſt be <hi>ſuppreſſed,</hi> and nothing muſt be allowed but what is <hi>cooling;</hi> if <hi>too low,</hi> it muſt be <hi>raiſed</hi> by warm <hi>Cordials,</hi> 'till the Heat of the Fleſh be ſomething beyond what is common: but yet great Care muſt be taken that it be not raiſed too high. A <hi>moiſt Skin</hi> is <hi>beſt,</hi> but <hi>profuſe Sweats</hi> are <hi>deſtructive,</hi> and to be <hi>checked,</hi> by keeping the Hands out of Bed, and leſſening the Bed Cloaths.

            <head>Medical Obſervations on the SMALL-POX. Anno 1730.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>Method</hi> I took in treating this Diſtemper; and which I found <hi>moſt ſucceſsful,</hi> was as follows:</p>
            <p>I adviſed my <hi>Patients,</hi> for whom I thought I ſhould be concerned, to <hi>Temperance</hi> in all Things, as the <hi>beſt Preparation</hi> for the Small-Pox; and to take <hi>Morning</hi> &amp; <hi>Evening</hi> 20 or 30 <hi>Drops</hi> of <hi>my Small-Pox Drops;</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">A <hi>Tincture</hi> drawn from <hi>Sulphur,</hi> to which add, <hi>Elixir Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietatis,</hi> ſo as to make a pleaſant Mixture.</note> or where thoſe will not go down, 30 or 40 <hi>Drops</hi> of <hi>Elixir Proprietatis</hi> This Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod I found in many Inſtances both this Year &amp; in 1721, <hi>very ſucceſsful</hi> to render the Diſtemper <hi>favourable.</hi> Thoſe who were <hi>conſtant</hi> in taking it, I obſerved <hi>eſcaped a long Time</hi> before they were ſeized, and had generally the moſt favourable Sort and <hi>many eſcaped it altogether</hi> without any Complaint, tho' greatly expoſed. I found alſo a <hi>Scruple</hi> of <hi>Flower of Brimſtone,</hi> in <hi>Milk</hi> or <hi>any Vehicle,</hi> to anſwer this End very well, taken <hi>once,</hi> or <hi>twice a Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="stage_of_illness">
               <head>Before the Eruption.</head>
               <p>When the <hi>Symptoms</hi> of this Diſtemper appeared, if they were favourable, I did little or nothing, but adviſed to dilute the Blood with ſome <hi>ſmall Tea</hi> of <hi>Baum,</hi> or <hi>what pleaſed the Appetite;</hi> and keep to a Diet of <hi>Water-Gruel</hi> for Food; <hi>Milk</hi> one Part, and <hi>Water</hi> three Parts, boil'd together for Drink; and <hi>wait</hi> for the <hi>Eruption:</hi> which if it <hi>appeared not the third Day.</hi> I endeavoured to promote, with this Mixture,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Syrup</hi> of <hi>Saffron</hi> 1 Ounce, <hi>Treacle Water</hi> half an Ounce, <hi>Carduus Water</hi> 2 Ounces, mixt, 3 or 4 Spoonfuls for a Doſe: To be repeated once in ſix Hours; obſerving in the mean time to drink <hi>plentifully</hi> of <hi>ſmall Tea</hi> or <hi>Milk and Water.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If there were any <hi>Signs of a foul Stomach;</hi> I gave a <hi>Vomit</hi> as <hi>ſoon as I had Opportunity, before the Eruption:</hi> and I ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled not to give it even <hi>when the Eruption was made,</hi> where the <hi>Signs</hi> of <hi>Foulneſs</hi> were manifeſt. For want of the Help
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006947_0009_102AD1D4C460A2D0"/>
of this, I found great Danger ariſing, and a Neceſſity often times to give it, even at the very Height of the Diſtemper. I never gave any but <hi>Ipecacuanha,</hi> for fear of over-working, and weakning my Patient; who had now a dangerous Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to go thro', that <hi>required the greateſt Strength</hi> to carry him thro'.</p>
               <p>If there were <hi>great Fulneſs of Blood, Aptneſs to Bleed at the Noſe.</hi> or <hi>Blood</hi> over-heat with <hi>Drinking,</hi> or its Paſſages ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed with taking <hi>Cold;</hi> in theſe Caſes I opened a <hi>Vein,</hi> and took away 8 or 10 <hi>Ounces</hi> of <hi>Blood:</hi> This I found a good <hi>Preparatory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In Caſe of Delirium</hi> or <hi>obſtructed Menſes;</hi> I choſe to <hi>bleed</hi> in the <hi>Feet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the Bleeding was over, I endeavoured to promote a Breathing with ſome <hi>ſmall Tea;</hi> which much facilitated the Eruption.</p>
               <p>Sometimes <hi>before the Eruption,</hi> I have found <hi>exceſſive Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting:</hi> This I endeavoured to carry off by a <hi>Vomit,</hi> if there appeared any <hi>Symptoms</hi> of <hi>Foulneſs</hi> of the <hi>Stomach:</hi> if not, I endeavoured to ſettle it by an <hi>Anodyne</hi> in ſome <hi>Alexiphar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic Julep,</hi> 
                  <abbr>viz.</abbr>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mint Water, Black Cherry Water,</hi> of each 2 <hi>Oz. Epidemic Water, Syrup</hi> of <hi>Saffron,</hi> of each half an Oz. <hi>Liquid Lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> 15 Drops, more or leſs, according to the Age of the Patient; 3 or 4 Spoonfuls for a Doſe, and repeated if Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion required. This often anſwered the Intention of Nature: which was now ſtrugling with the Malignity fix'd upon the Nerves of the Stomach, and threw it out to the Skin, which was the Thing aimed at.</p>
               <p>If there were a <hi>Coma</hi> or <hi>Delirium,</hi> or <hi>Raving,</hi> if there were <hi>no Signs</hi> of <hi>Overfulneſs</hi> of the Blood, or Humours of the Body, or Foulneſs of <hi>the Stomach;</hi> I now judged theſe Symptoms to ariſe from the variolous Matter fixed on the <hi>Nerves;</hi> and did little to remove them, but only <hi>diluted</hi> the <hi>Blood,</hi> and gave ſome <hi>gentle Alexipharmic:</hi> and if they remained <hi>obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</hi> I applied <hi>Attractives</hi> to the <hi>Feet;</hi> and <hi>Bliſters</hi> to the <hi>Wriſts</hi> and <hi>Ankles;</hi> and if Need required, behind the <hi>Ears:</hi> This I found moſt commonly to ſucceed.</p>

A <hi>Purging</hi> has happened ſometimes <hi>before the Eruption:</hi> which I was always <hi>very cautious of ſtopping,</hi> notwithſtanding the common Practice to the contrary. For where I have found this, I generally found the <hi>Confluent</hi> Sort to follow, eſpecially in <hi>Children.</hi> I therefore rather choſe to carry it off, with <hi>Rubarb</hi> in ſmall <hi>Doſes</hi> repeated; a <hi>third Part</hi> of a Doſe in <hi>Powder,</hi> repeated every ſix Hours, in a little <hi>Syrup</hi> of <hi>Saffron,</hi> or the <hi>ſame Part</hi> of a <hi>Doſe</hi> in <hi>Infuſion,</hi> ſweetned with the <hi>ſame Syrup.</hi> However, if it cauſed <hi>Coldneſs</hi> in the <hi>extream Parts</hi> (and was very ſevere) or any <hi>great Faintneſs;</hi> I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to <hi>check</hi> it by <hi>Oil of Cinnamon;</hi> or if that would not anſwer, with an <hi>Anodyne</hi> in ſome <hi>Alexipharmic Julep.</hi> The Mixture I uſed was, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mint-water</hi> 2 Oz. <hi>Diaſcord:</hi> one Drahm, <hi>Syrup Saffron</hi> 1 Oz. mixt, to be repeated every ſix Hours, if Occaſion. And the <hi>Diet,</hi> the <hi>white Decoction,</hi> with <hi>Cloves, Cinnamon</hi> and <hi>Nutmegs</hi> with it, as the Patient liked beſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bleeding at the Noſe</hi> often happened, and that to a very great Degree. This I endeavoured <hi>not to ſtop</hi> 'till it <hi>fainted</hi> the Patient. I have found great <hi>Damage</hi> enſue upon <hi>ſtopping it too ſoon.</hi> I endeavoured to <hi>cool</hi> the <hi>Blood</hi> by <hi>cooling Teas, Milk &amp; Water</hi> &amp;c, which was now ordinarily over-heat; and lay <hi>warm Attractives</hi> to the <hi>Feet,</hi> which would often be <hi>very cold</hi> at this Time. I never did bleed to turn the Blood, but always found the Method above-mentioned to ſucceed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Convulſion-Fits</hi> often happen, in <hi>Children eſpecially.</hi>—If there were any <hi>manifeſt Signs</hi> of <hi>Foulneſs</hi> of the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach</hi> and <hi>Fulneſs</hi> of <hi>Blood,</hi> I both bled them, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that gave a <hi>Vomit;</hi> after which was over, I applied <hi>Bliſters</hi> and <hi>Attractives,</hi> and ordered ſome <hi>Alexipharmic Julep</hi> to be repeated as the Symptoms called for. If the <hi>Fever</hi> was <hi>high;</hi> I endeavoured to lower it by <hi>Milk and Water, Water</hi> with a <hi>Toaſt</hi> in it, <hi>Small Beer</hi> &amp;c: if <hi>too low,</hi> I raiſed it by ſome generous <hi>Alexipharmic.</hi> Here I have found <hi>Anodynes</hi> neceſſary and very ſucceſsful, after <hi>proper E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuations,</hi> given in ſome <hi>Alexipharmic Julep.</hi> To a <hi>Child</hi> of

two Years old after <hi>bleeding</hi> and <hi>vomiting,</hi> I gave <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Contrayerva Root</hi> 5 Grains, <hi>Black Cherry-Water</hi> 1 Oz. <hi>Syrup</hi> of <hi>Saffron</hi> half an Oz. <hi>Liquid Laudanum</hi> 4 Drops, often, with good Succeſs. This both compoſed the Spirits which were <hi>now</hi> enraged, ſettled the over tenſion of the Fibres, and threw off the variolous Matter to the Skin. This I have found ſucceed, even when the <hi>Limbs</hi> have been left <hi>ſtiff</hi> and could not be bent without breaking, when the <hi>Fit</hi> ſeemed to be over.</p>

               <head>When the Eruption is made.</head>
               <p>I Was careful to obſerve what <hi>State</hi> the <hi>Fever</hi> was in: whether there was <hi>enough</hi> to carry on the Maturation, or <hi>too much</hi> to hinder, or precipitate it; and accordingly applied.</p>
               <p>Some were <hi>ſo hot,</hi> as to allow of nothing that was the leaſt Cordial, but called for the moſt temperate <hi>cooling</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
               <p>Theſe I treated with <hi>Milk and Water,</hi> which I allowed and perſwaded them to drink <hi>plentifully</hi> of; and <hi>Panada,</hi> or <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Gruel</hi> for their Food. <hi>This</hi> for the moſt Part <hi>ripened</hi> and <hi>filled</hi> the <hi>Puſtules.</hi> If it did not, I gave <hi>Gaſcoign Powder,</hi> Morning and Night, in a little <hi>Carduus-Water,</hi> ſweetned with <hi>Syrup</hi> of <hi>Saffron,</hi> or a little <hi>Epidemic</hi> W<hi>ater,</hi> diluted with <hi>Carduus-water,</hi> and ſweetned with ſome <hi>cooling Syrup,</hi> as <hi>Strawberries</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:006947_0012_102AD1DD5CE71BE0"/>
I found a <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of obſerving <hi>this Difference</hi> in treating my Patients. I obſerved many to die in keeping to the <hi>cooling Method</hi> without allowing them <hi>Cordials</hi> at due Intervals, as is now the common Method in Imitation of Dr. <hi>Sydenham;</hi> and this even in the <hi>diſtinct</hi> Sort of Pock.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Confluent</hi>—I found a Neceſſity of watching this carefully and varying as the Symptoms directed. If I ſaw it coming; I endeavoured to <hi>cleanſe the Body</hi> well both <hi>upwards</hi> and <hi>downwards</hi> as ſoon as I could, and <hi>bled</hi> them alſo if there were proper Indications for it. If a <hi>Purging</hi> attended it at the Beginning or Progreſs; I endeavoured only to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and moderate it, and not wholly to <hi>check</hi> it. In the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi> I gave <hi>Rubarb</hi> in ſmall Doſes every <hi>ſix Hours,</hi> which anſwered well, and ordered the <hi>white Decoct:</hi> for <hi>Food.</hi> I ordered for <hi>Drink,</hi> Milk and Water: and if the Fever was high, a <hi>Julep</hi> of <hi>Syrup</hi> of <hi>Elderberries</hi> well acidulated with <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Vitriol</hi> in all their <hi>Drink.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If a <hi>Cordial was wanted,</hi> or the <hi>Puſtules did not fill</hi> well; I ordered <hi>Powder</hi> of <hi>Gaſcoign,</hi> Morning and Night, or oftner if Need required, in ſome <hi>temperate Vehicle;</hi> being careful in the mean Time to dilute and temper the <hi>Blood</hi> with good Store of <hi>Liquid;</hi> nothing anſwered which Intention like <hi>Milk</hi> and <hi>Water</hi> in great Quantities. This <hi>cooling, diluting</hi> Method kept from <hi>Delirium</hi> and <hi>Raving;</hi> and followed cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, was the beſt Remedy to cure it. <hi>Bleeding</hi> I never found ſucceed <hi>after the Eruption was thoroughly made,</hi> even in <hi>Diſtraction</hi> it ſelf; but <hi>ſunk</hi> the <hi>Spirits</hi> and <hi>Puſtules</hi> too; and I ever found it difficult to ſave Life after it.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Puſtules</hi> ſeem to <hi>ſtrike in;</hi> I have found a <hi>Decoction</hi> of <hi>Snake-root,</hi> ſweetned with <hi>Syrup</hi> of <hi>Saffron</hi> given hot, to anſwer well. If that does not anſwer immediately; I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered <hi>Bliſters</hi> to the Wriſts and Ankles, and a <hi>Julep</hi> of the <hi>Contrayerva-Stone</hi> in <hi>Carduus Water, Syrup</hi> of <hi>Saffron,</hi> and <hi>Epidemic Water,</hi> to be followed every two Hours 'till the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi> was anſwered.

If the <hi>Throat</hi> be <hi>ſore</hi> with the Pock, I found a <hi>Saffron-Stay,</hi> or a Plaiſter of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> imbued with <hi>Oil</hi> of <hi>Mint,</hi> to relieve much.

If very much <hi>ſtuffed</hi> with <hi>Phlegm,</hi> I have applied a <hi>Bliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to the <hi>Nape of the Neck,</hi> and ſometimes given a <hi>Vomit,</hi> to ſave Life at any Time of the Pock.</p>
               <p>I have found great Advantage in an <hi>open Body,</hi> one Stool in a Day in the whole Courſe of the Diſtemper; contrary to the common Obſervation, in <hi>any</hi> Sort, eſpecially the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluent:</hi> and when there has been a great Load of Humours, have promoted it by a <hi>Suppoſitor,</hi> or <hi>looſening pectoral Decoction;</hi> tho' <hi>not by Purges. Sometimes</hi> I have allowed them to eat <hi>Figs</hi> and <hi>Raiſins,</hi> which both brought on the ripening of the Puſtules and kept the Body open ſufficiently.</p>
               <p>In <hi>raving Diſtraction,</hi> I have found Applications to the <hi>Feet,</hi> with <hi>ſtrong Attractives, Bliſters,</hi> and a <hi>cooling, diluting Diet</hi> taken plentifully, to anſwer beſt. <hi>Bleeding</hi> I never found to ſucceed here; except there were <hi>plain Indications</hi> for it from over fulneſs of <hi>Blood,</hi> and ſome Stagnation from <hi>taking Cold.</hi> If the <hi>Puſtules filled well,</hi> I was not over-buſy with Remedies; but I have found it to ceaſe of it ſelf, when the <hi>Pock</hi> had <hi>turned.</hi>

               <head>The Pock turning.</head>
               <p>When the Pock is ripe and begins to turn, great Care muſt be taken to prevent the <hi>ſecond Fever.</hi> A <hi>looſe Body</hi> is of great Service here, in every Sort of Pock. I therefore early ordered a <hi>Suppoſitor</hi> or <hi>Cliſter.</hi> If this anſwered not, I gave a <hi>Pectoral Decoction</hi> with good Succeſs. The <hi>Hierapicra</hi> has been very ſerviceable where it could be taken. And this I continued as often as I ſaw a <hi>Fever</hi> inclining to riſe. However I took Care to guard the Vitals by <hi>repeated Doſes</hi> of <hi>fixed</hi> or <hi>volatile Cordials,</hi> as the Symptoms required.</p>

If upon <hi>the Turning</hi> they were <hi>much oppreſſed</hi> in the <hi>Breaſt,</hi> or <hi>ſtuffed</hi> with <hi>Phlegm</hi> in the Organs of Reſpiration; I have found a <hi>Vomit</hi> to ſucceed, of <hi>Ipecacuanha</hi> or <hi>Vinum Emeticum</hi> and <hi>Pectoral Syrup,</hi> diluted with <hi>Hyſop Water,</hi> with a <hi>Bliſter</hi> to the <hi>Nape of the Neck.</hi> After this, the <hi>Pectoral De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction,</hi> and that with a little <hi>Sena,</hi> to make it more purging, if Need require.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cold chilly Fits</hi> are very apt to come <hi>at the Turning;</hi> which are prevented by a <hi>Cordial</hi> duly repeated, eſpecially <hi>Gaſcoign-Powder,</hi> and helped by a <hi>Cordial</hi> given immediately when they come.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>ſecond Fever ariſe, </hi> if it be attended with <hi>great Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion</hi> and <hi>Difficulty of Breathing,</hi> and <hi>Stagnation</hi> of the <hi>Blood;</hi> I have found <hi>Bleeding</hi> ſucceed; but not elſe. If it be <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate,</hi> a <hi>looſe Body</hi> ſuffices; if <hi>not, Bliſters</hi> and <hi>Purges</hi> of the <hi>gentle Sort</hi> have carried it off beſt, with a cooling, diluting <hi>Diet;</hi> not forgetting to intermix a <hi>Cordial</hi> fix'd or volatile, as the Symtoms called for.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Purples, Petechiae,</hi> and <hi>Indigo Pock;</hi> I have found the aforeſaid <hi>Rules</hi> to be moſt ſerviceable. The moſt <hi>ſmoothing, diluting Diet,</hi> and large Quantities of them, anſwer beſt: not forgetting <hi>Cordials,</hi> eſpecially <hi>fix'd Bezoardics;</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the moſt cooling Regimen ſignifies but little. <hi>Bleeding</hi> I have found of <hi>no Service</hi> here; except the common <hi>Indications</hi> for it were <hi>apparent.</hi> I have ſeen it repeated to a third Time, but to no Advantage, but apparently haſtned the Death of the Patient. Many have lived to the 9th <hi>Day,</hi> that have <hi>but few Remedies</hi> uſed; and ſome have <hi>recovered</hi> to a Surprize, that have been given over; tho' it has been very rare.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>H.</hi> recovered of the <hi>Purple</hi> Sort in the Uſe of <hi>diluting Diet</hi> and <hi>great Quantities</hi> of <hi>Elixir Proprietatis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>R.</hi> recovered of the <hi>Indigo</hi> Pock in the Uſe of the <hi>diluting Diet,</hi> with <hi>Syrup</hi> of <hi>Saffron, Treacle-Water,</hi> and <hi>Carduus-Water,</hi> and Morning and Night a Doſe of <hi>Gaſcoign Powder.</hi> I opened one of the <hi>Indigo</hi> Pock with a Lancet, found con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed hardned <hi>Blood,</hi> a quarter of an Inch deep: I dare not proceed deeper with it for fear of an <hi>Haemorage.</hi> I

                  <hi>generally</hi> found the Pulſe much depreſſed; and <hi>ſometimes</hi> but few Complaints, the Patients commonly thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves well 'till Death came on.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Anodynes;</hi> I have found them abſolutely neceſſary, and very ſerviceable to ſubdue the <hi>great Pain &amp; Fever</hi> that ariſes from thence from the <hi>Smart</hi> of the <hi>Pock.</hi> Theſe I <hi>ſeldom</hi> gave, 'till the Puſtules were thoro'ly out, and they began to complain of <hi>Soreneſs</hi> and <hi>Reſtleſneſs</hi> thereby; except in Caſe of <hi>Convulſions,</hi> and then not 'till due <hi>Evacuations</hi> have been made. A <hi>ſwelling</hi> of the <hi>Face</hi> commonly followed it; and it would raiſe this Swelling when no other Remedies would. It often took away a <hi>Delirium &amp; Raving,</hi> &amp; compoſed the Patient to reſt. I <hi>ordinarily</hi> gave them but <hi>once</hi> in 24 <hi>Hours</hi> at Night; tho' ſometimes in <hi>great Reſtleſneſs</hi> have given them <hi>oftner;</hi> and in the <hi>Confluent</hi> Sort, <hi>once</hi> in <hi>eight Hours.</hi> I commonly mix'd them in ſome <hi>cordial Julep,</hi> according to the Temper and Circumſtances of the Patient. In <hi>great Stuffage</hi> of the Lungs &amp; Breaſt, I gave them in ſome <hi>pectoral Mixture:</hi> Tho' ſometimes they checked the <hi>Salivation</hi> in the <hi>Confluent</hi> Sort, yet it returned ſoon with <hi>diluting Diet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to <hi>purging the Body after the Small-Pox;</hi> I have found it generally neceſſary. For want of it, many break out in <hi>Boils</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I have found a <hi>Vomit</hi> more ſerviceable than a <hi>Purge.</hi> For want of it, many times <hi>Purges,</hi> tho' very ſtrong, work not at all: tho' on the ſame Perſons the ſame <hi>Purge</hi> would work much in a much leſs Doſe.</p>
               <p>If the Patient was <hi>weak,</hi> I <hi>began</hi> with <hi>Rubarb</hi> or <hi>Pill Ruffi:</hi> and <hi>then</hi> after ſome Time, gave <hi>Jallap</hi> or <hi>Pill Cochiae Minor.</hi>

            <head>Small Pox by Inoculation. in 1730.</head>
            <p>I Entred upon it with the utmoſt <hi>Caution,</hi> and was careful to uſe it by the beſt <hi>Rules</hi> I could find preſcribed.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Matter</hi> I made uſe of; I endeavoured to take it of a <hi>wholſome Perſon,</hi> of a <hi>favourable diſtinct Sort</hi> of <hi>Pock,</hi> well <hi>ripe, white,</hi> and of a <hi>due Conſiſtence,</hi> and <hi>without Smell.</hi> This, as long as it would keep thus, I made uſe of; having kept it in the Month of <hi>March a Fortnight,</hi> and us'd it with as good Succeſs as any juſt taken. I always kept it in <hi>a cool Place,</hi> contrary to the common Precepts about it, to keep it warm 'till it was uſed. When I could get it from an <hi>inoculated Perſon</hi> I choſe it; having by Experience found it to yield the <hi>moſt favourable Pock.</hi> I have uſed the <hi>third Produce</hi> with the beſt Effect.</p>
            <p>If the Patient was <hi>very full of Blood</hi> and liv'd <hi>intemperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> I bled him before the Inciſion was made. And if there were any Signs of <hi>Foulneſs</hi> at the <hi>Stomach</hi> or <hi>Bowels;</hi> I <hi>vomited,</hi> or <hi>purged</hi> them, and ordered them <hi>Temperance</hi> in <hi>Eating</hi> and <hi>Drinking. Meat</hi> I allowed of the <hi>eaſieſt Digeſtion,</hi> but <hi>once</hi> a Day, and that in Moderation. <hi>Strong Drink</hi> I forbad, ſave a <hi>Glaſs</hi> of <hi>Wine</hi> at <hi>Meals.</hi> Above all, I charged them to <hi>keep out of the Way</hi> of receiving the <hi>Infection</hi> in the <hi>common Way</hi> as much as poſſible.</p>
            <p>I made the <hi>Inciſions</hi> in <hi>each Arm only,</hi> and <hi>not</hi> in a <hi>Legg;</hi> having obſerved <hi>great</hi> Inconvenience to ariſe from an Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion made in the <hi>Leg</hi> by the <hi>Humours</hi> falling down into it.</p>
            <p>I made the Inciſion <hi>not</hi> in the <hi>upper Side</hi> of the <hi>Arm,</hi> where <hi>Iſſues</hi> are made; having found great Inconvenience by that Method: for this Way, a <hi>Pond</hi> was made after a while, which <hi>contained</hi> the Matter 'till it was dreſſed; ſo that the Orifice was made much larger, and a <hi>Sinus</hi> often produced where the Humours were very ſharp.</p>
            <p>I therefore choſe to make it in the <hi>lower Part</hi> of the <hi>Arm above</hi> the <hi>Elbow;</hi> where the Matter vented itſelf as
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006947_0017_102AD1E8C5320460"/>
ſoon as it was made, and remained not in a Body in the Place of Inciſion. This Way I found they run more freely, and yet corroded the Fleſh not ſo much.</p>
            <p>I choſe <hi>not</hi> to dreſs my Patients Inciſions <hi>my ſelf,</hi> for fear of carrying the Infection to them, 'till they began to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the Symptoms of the Small-Pox; but directed them to dreſs them themſelves, or <hi>ſome</hi> Body elſe for them that would no Ways <hi>endanger</hi> them. I took Care <hi>not</hi> to bind the <hi>Roller</hi> too hard; having found a <hi>Tumour</hi> to ariſe often upon too ſtrict a Bandage, which needed <hi>Poulticing</hi> with <hi>white Bread and Milk</hi> to abate it.</p>
            <p>I ſaw <hi>no</hi> Need of making the <hi>Inciſions large</hi> or <hi>deep,</hi> or putting <hi>much</hi> of the Matter in; having found upon Trial, the <hi>leaſt Inciſions</hi> if deep enough to make the <hi>Blood come,</hi> to anſwer as well as the largeſt; and the very <hi>leaſt Part</hi> of Matter to anſwer as well as a <hi>great deal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have found <hi>two Inciſions</hi> in grown Perſons to anſwer much better than <hi>one only.</hi> I obſerved thoſe that had <hi>but one,</hi> had the moſt Pock, and the moſt troubleſome Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of Pains. Swellings &amp;c. Tho' in <hi>Infants,</hi> I have found <hi>one</hi> to anſwer very well.</p>
            <p>The <hi>firſt Dreſs</hi> was with a <hi>ſimple Diachylon Plaiſter.</hi> When the Inciſion was made, I carefully laid a Bit of <hi>Lint</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed well with the Matter, over or in the Inciſion: and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put the Plaiſter over it, I bound it on, and let it lie 24 <hi>Hours;</hi> and then took off the Plaiſter and Lint, and having wiped the Plaiſter clean, laid it on again, throwing away the Lint; and ſo continued to dreſs daily till the <hi>third</hi> or <hi>fourth Day,</hi> when the Inciſion began to open and be a little inflamed; and then I dreſſed it with a <hi>Pledget</hi> arm'd with <hi>Baſilicon</hi> laid over the Inciſion, and the ſame Plaiſter laid over it. This I found the beſt Dreſs; it both draw'd and digeſted, and kept the Arm eaſy.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Inciſions</hi> were <hi>much inflamed,</hi> I found nothing ſo effectual as a <hi>Poultice</hi> of <hi>white Bread &amp; Milk</hi> apply'd warm, and renewed <hi>twice a Day,</hi> and oftner if Need called for it. Sometimes when it was apt to breed a <hi>Fungus,</hi> I dreſs'd it with <hi>Liniment: Areaei,</hi> which anſwered well.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:006947_0018_102AD1EA97E94AC8"/>
If the Inciſions are <hi>not</hi> dreſſed <hi>twice a Day</hi> at leaſt, and ſometimes <hi>three Times;</hi> when they come to run much, they are very apt to be <hi>much inflamed;</hi> and I have ſeen a <hi>Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> ſoon gather. When the Inciſions do <hi>not</hi> run well; I fear a <hi>troubleſome</hi> and <hi>full Pock,</hi> and have often ſeen many <hi>Swellings</hi> to ariſe about the <hi>Arm</hi> eſpecially; which if taken in Time would quickly yield to a <hi>Poultice</hi> of <hi>white Bread and Milk</hi> better than any Thing elſe; and when <hi>thoſe</hi> are gone, <hi>others</hi> to ariſe and create much Trouble.</p>
            <p>I always obſerved the <hi>Inciſions</hi> to run <hi>much</hi> at the <hi>Turning,</hi> and more <hi>now</hi> than at any Time elſe.</p>
            <p>I <hi>never</hi> endeavoured to <hi>ſtop</hi> the Running of the <hi>Inciſions</hi> by Reſtringents; but continued in the Dreſs of <hi>Baſilicon</hi> or <hi>Liniment: Areaei,</hi> with the <hi>Plaiſter</hi> over it; and with <hi>this Dreſs</hi> I encouraged them to Dreſs, 'till they run exceedingly.</p>
            <p>When there appeared a <hi>large Sinus</hi> all round under the Skin; be not forward to cut it, but dreſs it carefully by filling it full of <hi>freſh white Break and Milk.</hi> This I have ſeen cure a <hi>very large one,</hi> in which I could carry my Finger clear round half an Inch under the Skin. If it muſt be cut, dreſs it with a little <hi>Liniment:</hi> with a <hi>few Grains</hi> of <hi>Mercurius Dulcis,</hi> and waſh it with <hi>Lime Water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I found the more the <hi>Inciſions run,</hi> the more favourable the Pock and all the Symptoms were. I therefore encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the <hi>Running</hi> as much as I could: but <hi>not</hi> by <hi>corroſive, pungent</hi> Plaiſters, as <hi>Hat<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The moſt troubleſome Symptoms of <hi>Fever, Coma,</hi> and <hi>Tumours</hi> in the <hi>Arms</hi> and <hi>Glandulus Parts,</hi> was in a Negro Girl; whoſe <hi>Inciſion</hi> run but very <hi>little.</hi> I gave lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no Medicine, 'till the <hi>Symptoms</hi> of the Small Pox appeared, but <hi>Elixir Proprietatis,</hi> which I order'd to be drank often in Water; and to abſtain from <hi>Meat;</hi> and to live upon a <hi>ſmoothing, diluting Diet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I ſaw the <hi>Spmptoms</hi> of the Small Pox beginning, I was very watchful to obſerve them. If the <hi>Fever, Pains,</hi> and <hi>Sickneſs</hi> were <hi>favourable;</hi> I choſe to do nothing, but <hi>leave the Work to Nature.</hi> If the <hi>Fever</hi> was <hi>very high;</hi> I choſe to lower it with a <hi>cooling diluting</hi> Diet, of <hi>Milk and Water, Water</hi> with a <hi>Toaſt</hi> in it, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:006947_0019_102AD1EC1CC7B0E8"/>
I <hi>never</hi> yet ſaw a Neceſſity of <hi>Bleeding</hi> any of my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, but <hi>one;</hi> who had taken <hi>cold,</hi> and thereby fix'd a <hi>great Pain</hi> in his <hi>Side.</hi> Neither did I ever obſerve any Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by <hi>Bleeding,</hi> but the contrary. The <hi>Pock</hi> was <hi>retarded,</hi> and the <hi>Patient</hi> much weakned.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Fever</hi> continued 'till the <hi>third Day</hi> of Complaint, and no <hi>Eruption</hi> appeared; I applied <hi>Bliſters,</hi> which anſwered for the moſt Part to draw forth the Pock, and abate the Fever; and if Need required, <hi>Attractives</hi> to the <hi>Feet.</hi> If there were any Signs of <hi>Foulneſs</hi> of the <hi>Stomach,</hi> I gave a <hi>Vomit</hi> of <hi>Ipecacuanha.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes <hi>Convulſions</hi> aroſe in <hi>Children</hi> before the Eruption, which went off themſelves, or with <hi>Bliſters &amp; Attractives</hi> to the <hi>Feet.</hi> Sometimes they lay <hi>comatous</hi> and <hi>reſtleſs,</hi> which I relieved by <hi>Bliſters &amp; Alexipharmic Julep<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> to drive out the Puſtules. When once the <hi>Eruption</hi> was made, the <hi>troubleſome Symptoms</hi> went off for the moſt Part. However I endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome <hi>gentle Alexipharmic Julep</hi> to forward the Growth and Ripening of the Pock. I found <hi>little Need</hi> of <hi>Anodynes:</hi> tho' if they were <hi>very ſore</hi> and <hi>reſtleſs,</hi> I always gave them. If they were <hi>very full</hi> of the Pock, I treated them in all Reſpects as in the <hi>common Small Pox.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>moſt of my Patients</hi> were <hi>very favourably</hi> dealt with: more than 50 out of 65; were ſitting up and walking about the Room ſoon after the Eruption was well made.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But one died</hi> that I inoculated: which was a <hi>Child</hi> 8 <hi>Weeks old,</hi> and under the Diſadvantage of <hi>loſing a full Breaſt,</hi> and put to <hi>one</hi> that was <hi>very diſagreable before</hi> to the Child, and <hi>now much more</hi> ſo by the <hi>Diſtreſs</hi> of the <hi>Nurſe</hi> (who was the Mother) not only with <hi>that</hi> Child but with <hi>three more</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the ſame Room.
