            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN Anſwer to your Requeſt, I have ſent you my Sentiments upon the late Pamphlet, entituled, <hi>A Diſcourſe on the Preparation of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for the</hi> SMALL-POX, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I had reſolved at firſt to confine my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to what had been ſaid in our News-papers; but upon a Review, I found nothing touched upon would give you the Satisfaction I conceived you might expect; the Foibles and little Vanities of the Author, which I found chiefly inſiſted on in thoſe Papers, were not of that Conſequence, as the Methods propos'd by the Author, for ſecuring Mankind from the dire Effects of that malignant Diſeaſe: I reſolved therefore to take an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial View of the whole, with that Candour and Clearneſs (the Bounds of a Letter would allow me, in a Matter of ſuch Importance) which in a curſory Manner, you'll find in the following Lines.</p>
            <p>DISCOURSE, Page 8. <hi>My principal Deſign is, to offer ſome Things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Preparation of the Body, and the Manner of receiving the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; which, from any Thing I have yet ſeen, appears to me, never to have been conſider'd with that Attention the Importance of the Subject de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>REMARK. This Charge againſt the Learned of the Faculty, upon due Conſideration, will be found a Miſtake in our Author himſelf, for want of Attention to the preparatory Methods, previouſly to be conſidered; which cannot be fixed upon, before the State and Condition of the Humours of the Body is known, which upon the firſt Invaſion of the Diſeaſe, is to be
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:006697_0003_1029AB0A7761A0A8"/>
collected from the Diſpoſition of the Fever ariſing from thence; and as it is different in different Subjects,<note n="*" place="bottom">General Rules of Diet, without Regard to particular Conſtitutions, are abſurd. <hi>Arbuthnot,</hi> ſecond Edit. Fol. 218.</note> no general ſtated Methods for preparing the Body, previous to the Invaſion of the Diſeaſe, can promiſe any real Advantage to the Patient: And if the Gentleman will conſider the Writings of learned and experienced Phyſicians, he will find, they have treated this Subject, as the Nature of the Caſe neceſſarily indicates, not only with Attention, but with a ſuperior Judgment, above the Reach of thoſe, whoſe natural Genius, or perhaps Opportunities of receiving Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Art of Healing, may not render them capable of underſtanding, much leſs able to preſcribe Precepts, or Rules of Practice in a Science, which as it is the moſt uſeful to Mankind, ſo is it the moſt worthy to be eſteemed before all others; and therefore not to be proſtituted to the vain Chimeras of a doubtful Hypotheſis.</p>
            <p>DISCOURSE, Page 10. <hi>It looks inflamed and ſizy, exactly like the Blood of a Perſon in a Pleuriſy, or any other inflammatory Diſorder; ſo nearly allied are the Symptoms of this contagious Fever, to that of a ſimple in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory One.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>REMARK. By our Author's Manner of here expreſſing himſelf, one would be led to imagine he took a Pleuriſy to be a ſimple inflammatory Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; but this, perhaps, may be for want of Attention to the antecedent Word <hi>Pleuriſy,</hi> otherwiſe it would repreſent the Author guilty of a capital Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, in his Theory of Diſeaſes: For a Pleuriſy has always been looked upon, and treated by the Learned of the Faculty, as an Inflammation of the worſt Kind: But our Author takes the Effect for the Cauſe, when he tells us (Page 10. Line 14.) <hi>When the Diſeaſe is violent, the dangerous Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances are all of the gangrenous Kind, ariſing from a putrid Diſſolution of the Blood.</hi> What putrid Diſſolution of the Blood there can be in a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riolous Fever, before the Appearance of the gangrenous State of the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtules, cannot be eaſily apprehended; for a variolous Fever is not ranged by Phyſicians among the Number of putrid Fevers, but among thoſe of the inflammatory Kind; and notwithſtanding the viſible Putrefaction occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the critical Diſcharge of the Puſtules, which determines the Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to the Skin, and membranous Coverings of the Throat and <hi>Viſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra;</hi> yet the Putrefaction attending the Diſeaſe, is evidently the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the gangrenous Appearances, and cannot be ſaid to take its Riſe from a putrid Diſſolution of the Blood, <hi>a Priori.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>DISCOURSE, Page 11. <hi>Putrefaction is always occaſion'd by too much Heat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:006697_0004_1029AB0DC9A24730"/>
REMARK. It is an undoubted Miſtake, to ſuppoſe Putrefaction is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways occaſioned by too much Heat, ſince it is known that Mortifications from a Defect of natural Heat, in low diſpirited Caſes, have produced the higheſt Degree of Putrefaction. In a Hiſtory of the Plague, written by a Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> in the Year 1665, we are told, that it was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Thing to ſee Perſons drop down dead in the Streets, and in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, without any previous Complaint, or Appearance of a Fever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending them, yet upon viewing their Bodies after Death, or even when they were yet expiring, there appeared the higheſt Degree of Rottenneſs and Putrefaction viſible upon them: And it is ſufficiently known, that in a Deficiency of animal Heat, after large Evacuations in the Dropſy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the worſt Symptoms of a Gangrene, and a Putrefaction of both Solids and Fluids, have appeared: And it is alſo the Opinion of eminent Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, that thoſe fatal Symptoms of Putrefaction attending the Plague, do ariſe from a Deficiency of animal Heat, being extinguiſhed by the delete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Miaſms of the Diſeaſe, by which the Motion of the Blood is retard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Humours do conſequently putrify.</p>
            <p>DISCOURSE, Page 11. Line 26. <hi>But Milk, and all Vegetables by Heat turn acid, which is directly oppoſite to Putrefaction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Page 12. Line 6. <hi>Blood, prepared chiefly from a ſub-acid vegetable, or Milk Diet, muſt be in general that State of the Body which is beſt fitted to receive an inflammatory Diſtemper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>REMARK. It is a Miſtake, to ſuppoſe Milk and vegetable Diet is always oppoſite to Putrefaction, for it is known to Phyſicians,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Arbuthnot's Eſſay on Aliments,</hi> Chap. v. Sect. 16.</note> that Milk, but eſpecially vegetable Diet, will turn to Putrefaction, and by a faulty Digeſtion of the Stomach, will be converted into an acid Acrimony, the immediate Cauſe of Head-achs, Deliriums, Pleuriſies, Peripneumonies, Ophthalmies, Tormina's of the Stomach and Bowels, and the worſt Kinds of inflammatory Diſorders; from hence may prove as unfit a Preparative for receiving the Infection of the SMALL-POX, as Food of either Fiſh or Fleſh; it is no eaſy Taſk for the moſt accurate Phyſician, to ſay, what Sort of Food or Medicine is the moſt proper Preparative for receiving the SMALL-POX, without previouſly knowing the true State of the Humours in the human Body:<note n="†" place="bottom">Idem, Chap. iv. Sect. 1.</note> The Blood in Health, from the many Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made upon it, has no perceivable Alkaly or Acid to be found in it; ſo that Food or Medicine, which may diſpoſe the Humours of the Body to an aceſcent State, which Milk and vegetable Diet may poſſibly do, muſt in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion diſpoſe the Humours of the Body to ſomething contrary to Health,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006697_0005_1029AB1889B0FCD0"/>
or what may be called morbid, and unfit to undergo the Severity of a malignant Diſeaſe, of which Kind the SMALL-POX is known to be; and alſo to preſcribe a low, ſpare and refrigerating Diet, as herein recommended, below what the Patient had been accuſtomed to, under a regular Way of living, free from any known Diſorder attending the human Frame, muſt neceſſarily ſubject the Body to new and uncertain Changes; the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum of the Blood (by ſubſtracting the accuſtomed Aliment) will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be reduced below the neceſſary Standard of Health: From hence the animal Secretions will become irregular and imperfect; and thoſe Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which otherwiſe would have been made at the cuticular Glands and Extremities, will be made nigher the Heart, and Fountain of animal Life: From hence the ſenſible and inſenſible Perſpiration, the gentle Breathings and benign Sweats, greatly conducive to the carrying off the variolous Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvia, will be leſſened, if not wholly ſuppreſs'd: Hence the Miaſmata, for want of the neceſſary Impetus of the circulating Fluids, will be inverted: And from hence it is thoſe dire Symptoms afflicting the Brain and vital Parts do neceſſarily ariſe, which when attended with an acid Acrimony, the common Caſe of Children and young Perſons, do frequently terminate in Inflammations, Gangrenes, putrid Fevers, Convulſions, Deliquiums, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which often reſiſt the moſt powerful Remedies: Alexipharmacs, and the warm Expellers uſed to throw the variolous Diſeaſe on the cuticular Glands, finding no Paſſage through their excretory Ducts, which are now become dry, rigid and ſhut up, ſerve only to heighten the Inflammation and threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening Symptoms: To attempt to reduce theſe Diſorders by Bleeding or any other Evacuation, in this low State of the circulating Fluids, is adding Strength to the Diſeaſe, and expoſing the Life of the Patient to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Danger; which fatal Conſequences, from a low milk—and eſpecially vegetable Diet, have been obſerved to happen in <hi>Europe,</hi> as well as in the Colonies of <hi>North America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>DISCOURSE, Page 14. <hi>It would be of the greateſt Benefit to Mankind to find out a ſpecifick Medicine which would either expel it entirely, or alter it ſo, as to render it quite innocent, or mitigate its malignant Quality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Page 15. <hi>But the Trial of an eaſy operating antimonial and mercurial Medicine as a Preparative, can be of no Danger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>REMARK. That excellent Phyſician,<note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Mead's Diſcourſe on the Small-Pox,</hi> Page 58</note> Dr. <hi>Mead,</hi> has ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd the Folly of hunting after Specificks, the common Amuſements of Ignorance, or Tricks of low Craft, to draw Pence out of the Pockets of the unthinking Populace, who generally admire thoſe moſt who have the Art of deceiving them beſt. To receive a Medicine as a ſpecifick Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative, Alterative, or Expeller, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in a Caſe where Life is at Stake,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006697_0006_1029AB218CFA5F58"/>
from the bare Conjecture of one Perſon only, eſpecially one, who we have Reaſon to think has been deceived, in his high Opinion of a milk and vegetable Diet, which he recommends as the moſt beneficial Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, in receiving the Infection of the SMALL-POX, would be as Idle as to take a Journey to the Moon, becauſe certain Aſtronomers do conceit it is inhabited, and which upon Trial may prove of as little Advantage to the Healths of Mankind, as the many Noſtrums, and Specificks, for the Cure of Cancers, and other extraordinary Diſeaſes, which we daily hear pretended to, by boaſting Quacks, and bold undertaking Mountebanks: As to the Diſcovery of the Specifick here pretended to, eſpecially the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius Dulcis;</hi> it has of a long Date been approved of as a beneficial Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine in the SMALL-POX, by the excellent <hi>Ludovicus, Etmuller,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; which alſo has been long and repeatedly made uſe of in this Caſe, in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> with the Addition of an antimonial Preparation; and tho' it may be allowed the Place of a good Preparative (by cleanſing the <hi>Viſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> and Organs of Secretion) being given immediately before the variolous Fever appears, or in the Manner <hi>Ludovicus</hi> adviſes, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſo as to open the Body with a Stool or two, upon the firſt Invaſion of the Diſeaſe, yet the benign Effects of this Medicine, will not admit of the high Character of a Specifick, by performing the mighty Feats our Author is led to imagine; or will it deſerve the Pains of writing a Diſcourſe on purpoſe to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Uſe of it, as a ſpecifick Medicine in the SMALL-POX, without ſome other more intereſting Conſideration, which, perhaps, might have been in our Author's View.</p>
            <p>DISCOURSE, Page 16. <hi>I gave them a Fortnight's Preparation in the Manner aforeſaid, and then they came freely into the Room where the others were. Two of them took the Diſeaſe, yet in the moſt moderate Manner, ſo as never to lie by an Hour with it: But the Third could not catch it at all, notwithſtanding he ſlept in the Bed with his Brothers and Siſters, with the</hi> SMALL-POX <hi>upon them.</hi>

            <p>THE firſt Appearance of the <hi>Bilious Fever</hi> (called alſo the <hi>Yellow Fever</hi>) in this Province, was in <hi>July,</hi> 1741. and in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1747. it made a ſecond Viſit; at its firſt Appearance it ſeem'd, eſpecially after three or four Weeks, to ſhew a Diſpoſition more inclining to a remarkable Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the animal Spirits, than at its Return in the Year 1747, in which Year, the animal Spirits ſeemed not ſo much exaſperated by an inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Heat, as extinguiſhed by the deleterious <hi>Miaſma</hi> of the Diſeaſe, which introduced Gangrenes and Mortifications on the Stomach and <hi>Viſcera,</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with black Vomits and cadaverous Stools; in both Caſes the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity ſeemed to exert its dire Efforts on the Stomach and Liver: Which of the two was the firſt Receptacle of this cruel Diſeaſe, we cannot ſay;
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006697_0012_1029AB3ED02D1918"/>
but certain it was, that a much heated acrid Bile, was the proximate and inſtrumental Cauſe of the tragical Appearances.</p>
            <p>To reduce what we have farther to ſay on this Diſeaſe into as narrow a Compaſs as poſſible, we ſhall give as brief a Hiſtory of the Diſeaſe, in the two Years in which it viſited this Province, as the Limits of our Letter will allow, to ſhew the pathognomick Signs, and Difference of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, as well as the different Methods of Cure uſed in each.</p>
            <p>IN the Year 1741. the Patient generally complained of an exceſſive Pain and Heat in his Stomach, a great Anxiety, and Diſquietude, with a Pain of the Head, a quick tremulous Pulſe, and a feveriſh Heat, which ſeemed to take its Riſe, not ſo much from an Inflammation of the ſanguinary Fluids, as from the animal Spirits, and nervous Bodies being ſtimulated and diſturbed by the acrid and overheated Bile, lodged in the Stomach and <hi>Viſcera;</hi> that this was the Cauſe of the Diſeaſe, appears very probable from the Caſe of a Perſon (now living) taken ill of the Diſeaſe, who fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently would jump out of Bed in a ſeeming delirious Surprize, attended with great Anxiety and Horror, who, when he came to himſelf, ſaid it was occaſioned by ſomething darting like a Flaſh of Fire from his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, through the Muſcles of his Side and Neck, and diſcharged itſelf with a ſhocking Exploſion into his Brain; which Deſcription of its Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from the Stomach to the Brain, ſhews, I conceive, that the nervous Fluid being heated, rarified, and put into a tumultuous Diſorder by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of the Parvagum Nerves in the Stomach communicating with the Brain, and being perhaps propelled by Means of an electrical Effort, or by Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi>'s elaſtick Spirit, was the Cauſe of this ſurpriſing Senſation: From hence, and from the univerſal Tremors, Anxieties, and Diſquietudes: the great Diſorder of the Spirits and nervous Syſtem were clearly manifeſt; in which Caſe to adminiſter Vomits, greatly exaſperated the Symptoms, and inſtead of relieving the Patient, brought on an irremediable Vomiting, Hiccough, and Inflammation of the Stomach; yet ſometimes a little warm Water, to cleanſe the Stomach from the acrid Bile, was of Service; Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Patient, with a View to abate the feveriſh Heat, was ſucceeded with a Debility of the Pulſe, and Sinking of the Spirits; no warm Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial or Alexipharmacs, did ſeem to agree with the Diſeaſe; in this Caſe a Doſe of <hi>Glaubers Salt,</hi> diſſolved in Sack-whey, or If the Heat at the Stomach was great, in Barley-drink, and repeated daily for three or four Days ſucceſſively, greatly conduced to the removing of the Pain and Heat at the Stomach, with large Draughts of Chicken-broth, Sack-whey or Barley-drink, uſed in the Working; which Purge was generally ſucceeded with a large Diſcharge of a green acrid Bile, which ſenſibly relieved the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006697_0013_1029AB42160DF730"/>
Patient: And in the intermediate Times of taking the Salt, the Patient had frequently given him, a Spoonful of <hi>Riverius's</hi> Anti-emetick, which was made with Half a Drachm of Salt of Tartar diſſolved in two Spoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls of Juice of Lemons, with the Addition of a little Treacle-water, and Spirit of Mint; and ſometimes <hi>Lapis Contrayerva,</hi> judiciouſly mixed with Nitre, Saffron, Cochineal and Caſtor, given every four Hours in Sack-whey; and after the Stomach and Bowels had been ſufficiently cleanſed from the diſtempered Bile, Bliſters to the Neck and Wriſts, with Sudori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficks, Reſtoratives and Pearl Juleps, rarely failed of bringing the Patient to a happy Recovery.</p>
            <p>IN the Year 1747. the Pain and Heat at the Stomach was not ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally complained of by the Patient, eſpecially in the firſt Days of the Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as in the Year 1741. but the Pains of the Head, Back and whole Body, like wandering rheumatick Pains, were more perceivable; nor was the nervous Heat, or deadly Vomitings ſo frequent, eſpecially in the firſt two or three Days of the Illneſs, nor was the Pulſe altogether ſo weak and tremulous; ſo that in a <hi>Plethora</hi> it would ſometimes bear once Bleeding; gentle Vomits of warm Water, or Carduus-tea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon a Sickneſs at the Stomach, might be taken with Advantage to the Patient: But although thoſe Symptoms were not on the firſt two, or three Days violent, yet very often when the Patient was thought to have paſt the worſt of the Diſeaſe, he was ſeized with all the fatal Appearances of Malignity, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> Hic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coughs, Anxieties, violent Pains of the Stomach, feveriſh Heats, and black Vomitings, ſucceeded with cold Sweats and Faintings, which generally concluded with cadaverous Stools, the fatal Preſages of a deadly Mortification of the Stomach and <hi>Viſcera;</hi> in which Caſe the above Medicines and Methods uſed in the Year 1741. judiciouſly made uſe of at the firſt Appearance of the Diſeaſe, were found to anſwer the wiſh'd for End. But when, from the flattering Appearances of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, or miſtaken Expectations from the Uſe of other Medicines, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Methods had been neglected in the firſt Days of the Diſeaſe, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity ſo far prevailed, as to reſiſt the moſt powerful Remedies.</p>
            <p>IT may be neceſſary further to obſerve, That the Fever of the Year 1747. of which we are now treating, did diſtinguiſh itſelf from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Year 1741. by a large and copious Diſcharge by Vomit, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by Stool, of a grumous Fluid, not much unlike Coffee-grounds, which ſometimes appeared mixed with Blood and rotten Membranes, this was called the <hi>Black Vomit,</hi> which before the Mixture of Blood and rotten Membranes did appear (which were deadly Symptoms) would often yield to the Uſe of the above Remedies; but when it proved difficult to be
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006697_0014_1029AB48D5C86A80"/>
ſtopped (which would greatly aggravate the fatal Symptoms) the only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy which appeared effectual in the Caſe, was a Mixture of diſtilled Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar and Spirit of Mint, which ſometimes would put a Stop to the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, even when the fatal Symptoms had made their Appearance. And it is farther to be obſerved, that in the Diſeaſe of the preceding Year, acid Medicines, even Juice of Lemons, were for the moſt Part diſagreeable to the ſick Patient; yet in this Year 1747. they had a better Effect, and were generally, both more acceptable and uſeful to the Patient, eſpecially <hi>Spiritus Nitri Dulcis,</hi> mixed with a mild Cordial Julep, which greatly cooled and refreſhed the ſick and much diſturbed Stomach; to which Purpoſe, Tartar-whey greatly contributed; and ſometimes a gentle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Draught, which much refreſhed the Sick, after the violent Heat and Rage of the Diſeaſe was over; provided the low and vapid Condition of the Spirits (which in this Caſe was very perceivable) did not forbid the Uſe of this otherwiſe comfortable Medicine.</p>
            <p>FROM the above I think it is evident, that Catharthicks, by promoting a Secretion of the diſtemper'd Bile, and cleanſing the Stomach and <hi>Viſcera,</hi> were the moſt advantageous. Medicines in the Cure of this <hi>Bilious Fever,</hi> eſpecially ſince it appears, that the Diſeaſe was of a Nature which would not admit of waiting, for either Digeſtion, or critical Days; ſo that to have rigorouſly obey'd the Aphoriſm of <hi>Hippocrates, Concocta non cruda, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canda ſunt,</hi> would have expoſed the Patient to the utmoſt Fury of this moſt deſtructive Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>As to our Author's ſuppoſed Excellence of the Bark, in the Cure of putrid Ulcers, notwithſtanding the Recommendations of Dr. <hi>Monro,</hi> and others, it has not been found, in many Trials which have been made of it in that Caſe, to do more than might have been expected from Wine medicated with Cinnamon; and yet much ſhort of an <hi>Aqua Calcis</hi> ſuited to the Temperament of the Patient, and other Circumſtances attending the Caſe: And it is highly reaſonable to believe, that the Cures ſuppoſed by Dr. <hi>Monro,</hi>

Line 2.) <hi>which ſupply the Arms, come from the Subclavians, and they derive their Original from the aſcending Trunk of the</hi> Aorta. But how an Artery at its Extremity, ſhould convey the variolous Infection to Parts far above it, will be as difficult, as to ſay, by what Means a Stone ſhall raiſe itſelf up into the middle Region of the Air, without the Help of a mechanical Power, to repel the Force of Attraction: The Blood in the Extremities of the Arteries (by their Anaſtomoſis with the Veins) is return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back to the Heart, where by Means of the aſcending and deſcending Trunks of the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> uniting in one, they diſcharge their Contents into the right Ventricle of the Heart; where the whole Maſs of refluent Blood is there mixed, and from thence is conveyed by the <hi>Aorta</hi> into all Parts of the Body; ſo that from the ſtated Laws of Circulation, it does not ſeem very poſſible, that the Infection ſhould be conveyed towards the Head, rather than the more inferior Parts of the Body; therefore what the Gentleman ſuppoſes, <hi>That it would be much to the Benefit and Safety of the Patient,</hi> is an Imagination not founded on the Laws or Principles of phyſical Learning, which he ſo highly lays Claim to.</p>
            <p>THUS Sir, I have finiſhed what I at firſt propos'd, which was to give you my Sentiments upon that Part of the Diſcourſe, which more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly relates to the Preſervation of Perſons labouring under that too often ſevere Illneſs, the SMALL-POX; and if what I have done may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to give you a juſt Caution to avoid the Vanity of Hypotheſis and ill grounded Conceits, I ſhall have my End: For I do aſſure you, it was neither Vanity, or an Itch of Writing, which led me to undertake a Taſk of this Nature; but to detect Miſtakes in a Matter which ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerns the Welfare of Mankind.</p>
