            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

That all the Lands or Countries Weſtward from the <hi>Atlantic Ocean</hi> to the <hi>South Sea,</hi> between 48 and 34 Degrees of North Latitude, were expreſsly included in the Grant of King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, to divers of his Subjects, ſo long ſince, as the Year 1606, and afterwards confirmed in 1620; and under this Grant, the Colony of <hi>Virginia</hi> claims an Extent as far Weſt as to the <hi>South Sea;</hi> and the antient Colonies of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut,</hi> were by their reſpective Charters, made to extend to the ſaid <hi>South Sea;</hi> ſo that not only the Right to the Sea Coaſt, but to all the Inland Countries, from Sea to Sea, have at all Times been aſſerted by the Crown of <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That the Province of <hi>Nova-Scotia</hi> or <hi>Accadia,</hi> hath known and determinate Bounds, by the original Grant from King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt; and that there is abundant Evidence of the ſame, and of the Knowledge which the <hi>French</hi> had of theſe Bounds, while they were in Poſſeſſion of it; and that theſe Bounds being thus known, the ſaid Province by the Treaty of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> according to its antient Limits, was ceded to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and remained in Poſſeſſion thereof, until the Treaty of <hi>Aix la Chapelle,</hi> by which it was confirmed; but by ſaid Treaty it is ſtipulated, That the Bounds of the ſaid Province ſhall be determined by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>That by the Treaty of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> the Country of the <hi>Five Cantons</hi> of the <hi>Iroquoiſe,</hi> is expreſsly acknowledged to be under the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the Crown of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That the Lake <hi>Champlain,</hi> formerly called Lake <hi>Iroquoiſe,</hi> and the Country Southward of it, as far as the <hi>Dutch</hi> or <hi>Engliſh</hi> Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements, the Lake <hi>Ontario, Erie,</hi> and all the Countries adjacent, have by all antient Authors, <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> been allowed to belong to the <hi>Five Cantons</hi> or <hi>Nations;</hi> and the whole of thoſe Countries, long before the ſaid Treaty of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> were by the ſaid <hi>Nations,</hi> put under the Protection of the Crown of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That by the Treaty of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> there is a Reſerve to the <hi>French,</hi> a Liberty of frequenting the Countries of the <hi>Five Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and other <hi>Indians</hi> in Friendſhip with <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> for the Sake of Commerce; as there is alſo to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> a Liberty of frequenting the Countries of thoſe in Friendſhip with <hi>France,</hi> for the ſame Purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>That after the Treaty of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> built ſeveral Fortreſſes in the Country of the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> and a very ſtrong one at a Place called <hi>Crown-Point,</hi> to the South of the Lake <hi>Champlain.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That the <hi>French</hi> Court have evidently, ſince the Treaty of <hi>Aix la Chapelle,</hi> made this Northern Continent more than ever, the Object of its Attention.</p>
                        <p>That the <hi>French</hi> have moſt unjuſtly taken Poſſeſſion of a Part of the Province of <hi>Nova-Scotia;</hi> and in the River St. <hi>John's,</hi> and other Parts of ſaid Province, they have built ſtrong For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes; and from this River they will have, during the Winter
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007433_0006_102D71D9DA9FA0C8"/>and Spring Seaſon, a much eaſier Communication between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Canada,</hi> than they have heretofore had, and will be furniſhed with a Harbour more commodiouſly ſituated for the Annoying the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Colonies by Privateers and Men of War, than <hi>Louis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi> itſelf.</p>
                        <p>That they have taken Poſſeſſion of, and begun a Settlement at the Head of the River <hi>Kennebeck,</hi> within the Bounds of the Province of <hi>Main,</hi> the moſt convenient Situation for affording Support, and a ſafe Retreat, to the <hi>Eaſtern Indians,</hi> in any of their Attempts upon the Governments of <hi>New-England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That is appears by the Information of the Natives, the <hi>French</hi> have been making Preparations for another Settlement, at a Place called <hi>Cobaſs,</hi> on <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, near the Head thereof, where 'tis but about ten Miles diſtant from a Branch of <hi>Merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack</hi> River; and from whence, there is a very near and eaſy Communication with the <hi>Abnekais Indians,</hi> who are ſettled on the River St. <hi>Francois,</hi> about forty Miles from the River St. <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;</hi> and it is certain, the Inhabitants of <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> in which Province this <hi>Cohaſs</hi> is ſuppoſed to lie, have been inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and impeded by the <hi>French Indians,</hi> from making any Settlement there.</p>
                        <p>That ſince the Treaty of <hi>Aix la Chapelle,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the Number of their Forts in the Country of the great Lakes, and on the Rivers which run into the <hi>Miſſiſippi,</hi> and are ſecuring a Communication between the two Colonies of <hi>Louiſiana</hi> and <hi>Canada,</hi> and at the ſame Time, putting themſelves into a Capacity of annoying the Southern <hi>Britiſh</hi> Colonies, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting any further Settlements of His Majeſty's Dominions.</p>
                        <p>That they have been gradually increaſing their Troops in <hi>America,</hi> tranſporting them in their Ships of War, which return to <hi>France</hi> with a bare Complement of Men, leaving the reſt in their Colonies; and by this Means, they are leſs obſerved by the Powers of <hi>Europe,</hi> than they would be, if Tranſports as uſual heretofore, were provided for this Purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>That they have taken Priſoners diverſe of His Majeſty's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, trading in the Country of the <hi>Iroquoiſe,</hi> and other inland Parts, and plundered ſuch Priſoners of ſeveral Thouſand Pounds Sterling; and they are continually exciting the <hi>Indians</hi> to deſtroy or make Priſoners the Inhabitants of the Frontiers of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Colonies; which Priſoners are carried to <hi>Canada,</hi> and a Price equal to what Slaves are ſold in the Plantations, is demanded for their Redemption and Releaſe.</p>
                        <p>That they are continually drawing off the <hi>Indians</hi> from the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Intereſt, and have lately perſwaded one Half of the <hi>Onon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dago</hi> Tribe, with many from the other Nations along with them, to remove to a Place called <hi>Oſwegachie,</hi> on the River <hi>Cadaracqui,</hi> where they have built them a Church and Fort; and many of the <hi>Senecas,</hi> the moſt numerous Nation, appear to be wavering, and rather inclined to the <hi>French.</hi> And it is a melancholy Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that not more than 150 Men of all the ſeveral Nations,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007433_0007_102D86039A3B35C0"/>have attended this Treaty, altho' they had Notice, that all the Governments would be here by their Commiſſioners, and that a large Preſent would be given.</p>
                        <p>That it is the evident Deſign of the <hi>French</hi> to ſurround the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Colonies, to fortify themſelves on the Back thereof, to take and keep Poſſeſſion of the Heads of all the important Rivers, to draw over the <hi>Indians</hi> to their Intereſt, and with the Help of ſuch <hi>Indians,</hi> added to ſuch Forces as are already arrived, and may be hereafter ſent from <hi>Europe,</hi> to be in a Capacity of making a general Attack upon the ſeveral Governments; and if at the ſame Time, a ſtrong Naval Force be ſent from <hi>France,</hi> there is the utmoſt Danger, that the whole Continent will be ſubjected to that Crown: And that the Danger of ſuch a Naval Force is not meerly imaginary, may be argued from paſt Experience. For had it not been by the moſt extraordinary Interpoſition of Heaven, every Sea Port Town on the Continent, in the Year 1746, might have been ravaged and deſtroyed, by the Squadron under the Command of the Duke <hi>D'Anville,</hi> notwithſtanding the then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining State of the <hi>French,</hi> and the very flouriſhing State of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Navy, and the further Advantage accruing to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> from the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Cape-Breton.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That the <hi>French</hi> find by Experience, they are able to make greater and more ſecure Advantages upon their Neighbours, in Peace than in War. What they unjuſtly poſſeſſed themſelves of, after the Peace of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> they now pretend they have a Right to hold, by Virtue of the Treaty of <hi>Aix la Chapelle,</hi> until the true Boundary between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> be ſettled by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners; but their Conqueſts made during War, they have been obliged to reſtore.</p>
                        <p>That the <hi>French</hi> Affairs relative to this Continent, are under one Direction, and conſtantly regarded by the Crown and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, who are not inſenſible how great a Stride they would make towards an Univerſal Monarchy, if the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Colonies were added to their Dominions, and conſequently the whole Trade of <hi>North-America</hi> engroſſed by them.</p>
                        <p>That the ſaid Colonies being in a divided, diſunited State, there has never been any joint Exertion of their Force, or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, to repel or defeat the Meaſures of the <hi>French;</hi> and particular Colonies are unable and unwilling to maintain the Cauſe of the whole.</p>
                        <p>That there has been a very great Neglect of the Affairs of the <hi>Iroquoiſe,</hi> as they are commonly called, <hi>the Indians of the Six Nations,</hi> and their Friendſhip and Alliance has been improved to private Purpoſes, for the Sake of the Trade with them, and the Purchaſe or Acquiſition of their Lands, more than the Public Services.</p>
                        <p>That they are ſupplyed with Rum by the Traders, in vaſt and almoſt incredible Quantities; the Laws of the Colonies now in Force, being inſufficient to reſtrain the Supply. And the <hi>Indians</hi> of every Nation, are frequently drunk, and abuſed in their Trade,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007433_0008_102D860590D41EE8"/>and their Affection thereby alienated from the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> they often wound and murder one another in their Liquor, and to avoid Revenge, fly to the <hi>French;</hi> and perhaps more have been loſt by theſe Means, than by the <hi>French</hi> Artifice.</p>
                        <p>That Purchaſes of Land from the <hi>Indians</hi> by private Perſons, for ſmall trifling Conſiderations, have been the Cauſe of great Uneaſineſs and Diſcontents; and if the <hi>Indians</hi> are not in fact impoſed on and injured, yet they are apt to think they have been; and indeed, they appear not fit to be entruſted at Large, with the Sale of their own Lands: And the Laws of ſome of the Colonies, which make ſuch Sales void, unleſs the Allowance of the Government be firſt obtained, ſeem to be well founded.</p>
                        <p>That the Granting or Patenting vaſt Tracts of Land to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Perſons or Companies, without Conditions of ſpeedy Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements, has tended to prevent the Strengthening the Frontiers of the particular Colony where ſuch Tracts lie, and been Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to the reſt.</p>
                        <p>That it ſeems abſolutely neceſſary, that ſpeedy and effectual Meaſures be taken, to ſecure the Colonies from the Slavery they are threatned with; that any farther Advances of the <hi>French</hi> ſhould be prevented; and the Encroachments already made, removed.</p>
                        <p>That the <hi>Indians</hi> in Alliance or Friendſhip with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> be conſtantly regarded under ſome wiſe Direction or Superintend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancy. That Endeavours be uſed for the Recovery of thoſe <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> who are lately gone over to the <hi>French,</hi> and for ſecuring thoſe that remain. That ſome diſcreet Perſon or Perſons be appointed to reſide conſtantly among each Nation of <hi>Indians;</hi> ſuch Perſon to have no Concern in Trade, and duly to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate all Advices to the Superintendants.</p>
                        <p>That the Trade with the ſaid <hi>Indians</hi> be well regulated, and made ſubſervient to the Public Intereſt, more than to private Gain.</p>
                        <p>That there be Forts built for the Security of each Nation, and the better carrying on the Trade with them. That warlike Veſſels be provided, ſufficient to maintain His Majeſty's Right to a free Navigation on the ſeveral Lakes.</p>
                        <p>That all future Purchaſes of Lands from the <hi>Indians</hi> be void, unleſs made by the Government where ſuch Lands lie, and from the <hi>Indians</hi> in a Body, in their public Councils. That the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentees or Poſſeſſors of large unſettled Territories, be enjoined to cauſe them to be ſettled in a reaſonable Time, on Pain of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture.</p>
                        <p>That the Complaints of the <hi>Indians,</hi> relative to any Grants or Poſſeſſions of their Lands, fraudulently obtained, be inquired into, and all Injuries redreſſed.</p>
                        <p>That the Bounds of thoſe Colonies which extend to the <hi>South Seas,</hi> be contracted and limited by the <hi>Alleghenny</hi> or <hi>Apalachian</hi> Mountains; and that Meaſures be taken, for ſettling from time to time, Colonies of His Majeſty's Proteſtant Subjects, Weſtward
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007433_0009_102D8607A80C9FE0"/>of ſaid Mountains, in convenient Cantons, to he aſſigned for that Purpoſe. And finally, that there be an Union of His Majeſty's ſeveral Governments on the Continent, that ſo their Councils, Treaſure, and Strength, may be imployed in due Proportion, againſt their common Enemy.</p>

            <p>THUS having ſeen Abſtracts of the Authorities given the Commiſſioners who were at <hi>Albany,</hi> and of thoſe Letters from the Crown, which occaſioned ſuch Authorities to be given; together with the State of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Colonies in <hi>America,</hi> and the propoſed Plan of Union, formed in Conſequence of the whole: From and impartial View thereof, let every Man judge, Whether it was not the Intent of all the Colonies who ſent Commiſſioners, that they ſhould form ſome <hi>General Scheme</hi> or <hi>Plan,</hi> for the Safety and Defence of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies, and the <hi>Indians</hi> in their Alliance? Look into the Commiſſion from Governor <hi>Greene:</hi> and after full Powers are given to do every Thing relative to the <hi>Indians</hi> in Alliance with us, What mean theſe following Words? <q>And alſo, <hi>what elſe may be neceſſary</hi> to prohibit the <hi>French,</hi> and their Allies the <hi>Indians,</hi> from encroaching on the Lands within the Dominions of His Majeſty. And in general, as far as the Abilities of this Government will permit, <hi>to act in Conjunction</hi> with the ſaid Commiſſioners, in every Thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Good of His Majeſty's Subjects in theſe Parts. And to anſwer as far as we can, the Deſigns of His Majeſty's Inſtructions to this Colony, communicated to us by the Earl of <hi>Holderneſſe.</hi>
               </q> Surely ſuch Words as theſe, have ſome Meaning;
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007433_0013_102D8610519E8F20"/>and if the Commiſſoners were ſo unhappy as quite to miſtake their Meaning, let thoſe penetrating Wits who think ſo, ſhew to the World, how they are to be underſtood. But if thoſe Authorities were too extenſive, let them be blamed who gave ſuch Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and not thoſe who executed them in the moſt ſparing Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner poſſible. And will any Man believe, ſuch exact Likeneſs in Subſtance, ſhould be in the Authorities given by every Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their Commiſſioners, without having any Conference together about it, if the Directions from the Crown had not pointed it out to them in ſo plain a Manner, that they all underſtood them alike? And is it not as plain, from the Letters ſince received from the Secretaries of State, that they all underſtood them in the Senſe the King intended them?</p>
            <p>Altho' all this were allowed, yet ſome may ſay, If you had Powers given you to enter into ſome ſuch General Scheme, you ought not to have conſented to one ſo hurtful and deſtructive of our Liberties as this is! Whether the Plan formed at <hi>Albany,</hi> be a good one, or a bad one, I ſhall not undertake to determin; yet let it be conſidered, that the <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> Commiſſioners were but two of the whole Number, and therefore were far from being able to govern or form Things as they might think beſt; neither did they ever pretend they could not be miſtaken; and Errors of Judgment will always be forgiven by Men of Candor.</p>
            <p>And now let us examin what the Commiſſioners did relating to this Plan, and we ſhall find, they did no more than form it, and agree to lay it before the General Aſſemblies of the Colonies from whence they came, for their Conſideration. They did not, as is falſly aſſerted, order it to be ſent Home. They did not eſtabliſh it as an Act or Ordinance of the Board of Commiſſioners, as they all might have done, by the Authorities given them. They did not leave it in the Power of any one to obtain a Copy of it, and ſend it Home; but ſtrictly forbid their Secretary to give any Copy, except to the Colonies. Nor did they ever agree to any Thing more, than to carry it to their reſpective Governments, and lay it before their Conſtituents. And agreable to the Reſolve of the Board of Commiſſioners, thoſe from <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> did lay this Plan, with all other their Proceedings at <hi>Albany,</hi> before the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſembly, at their Seſſion in <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt, for their Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. Was this criminal! Was this betraying their Truſt! Or was there any Thing more in this, than their Duty! Even Envy and Ignorance joined together, cannot ſay there was! And thoſe who have been bold enough to Aſſert, That any Thing more relating to this Plan of Union was done, ſuffered to be done, or connived at, by the Commiſſioners, are hereby publicly called upon, to prove their Aſſertions, or confeſs their Falſhood.</p>
            <p>Once more, let us hold up this ſo much talked of, <hi>Plan of Union,</hi> and view it in another Light: And here, to do my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries all the Juſtice they can poſſibly deſire, I will, for Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-ſake, confeſs it to be as bad as they repreſent it to be. Viewing it in this Light, it muſt be ſound contrary to, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſive of our happy Conſtitution, and all thoſe valuable Privileges

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>we enjoy under it. This deſtructive Plan was laid before the General Aſſembly, for their Conſideration, in the Month of <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt: This gave an Opportunity to thoſe Patriots belonging to the Council, who now ſay ſo much againſt this Plan, to have exerted themſelves in Defence of our Liberties, ſo much in Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and prevented the diſmal Effects ſo much ſeared. Well! What have theſe Champions for Liberty, done in this Matter? Have they not let it lie before the Aſſembly between ſix and seven Months, without taking it once under Conſideration? Or, Have they ever rejected it? or ſo much as once in all this Time, moved to have one Word wrote Home, to prevent its taking Place? Was it bad, as they ſay 'tis, then certainly 'twas their Duty to have done all in their Power to prevent its taking Effect. All Men muſt confeſs, the Plan was either good or bad; if 'twas good, Why do they blame it? if 'twas bad, Why have they done Nothing about it?</p>
            <p>Now, let every ſober-minded Man determin, Whether theſe Men can be real Friends to the Colony, who placed in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Offices, and intruſted with its Safety, could let a Thing ſo dangerous to its Intereſt, lie unobſerved by the General Aſſembly, near ſeven Months, 'till perhaps it may be too late to prevent it? And then to ſerve a private Party Turn, ſuddenly to roar out, <hi>The Colony is in Danger!</hi> All who have Eyes, will ſee thro' ſuch thin Diſguſes, and be aſſured, that the Deſigns of theſe Men, are only to blaſt the Reputation of one of the <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, who at preſent may ſeem to ſtand in their Way; and not to do the Colony any Service; for if that had been the Caſe, they would have told us theſe Things ſooner.</p>
            <p>What could the Commiſſioners for <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> have done more? or what could they have done leſs than they did, relative to this Plan? It was not in their Power to procure a better; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was good or bad, it was equally their Duty to lay it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Aſſembly who ſent them: They did ſo, and did no more; and every Member of both Houſes of Aſſembly can bear Witneſs, I have never uſed the leaſt Endeavour to induce them to accede to it. If it is bad, as ſome are pleas'd to repreſent it, Muſt not every Man ſay. They who have ſuffered it to lie thus long, are the very Men who have betrayed their Truſt, and the Intereſt of the Colony?</p>
            <p>Real want of Merit, occaſions theſe Men's Endeavour to riſe upon the Ruin of their neighbour's Reputation. But can the Faults of my Neighbour, make me fit for an Office? And can the valuable Privileges of this Colony be ſafe in thoſe Hands, where every Thing elſe ſeems to be neglected, but what will ſerve their private Purpoſes? As I am a Candidate for an Office, I ſincerely deſire all Men may put their Country's Intereſt in the firſt Place, and give their Votes only where they think 'tis moſt ſafe; and aſſure themſelves, ſuch a Conduct will perfectly pleaſe the Colony's, and their Friend,</p>
