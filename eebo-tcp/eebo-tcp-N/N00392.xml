            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Their <hi>Necks</hi> would be broken, so that their <hi>Neck-bone</hi> would seem dissolved unto them that felt after it; and yet on the sudden, it would become again so <hi>stiff</hi> that there was no stirring of their <hi>Heads;</hi> yea, their Heads would be twisted almost <hi>round;</hi> and if main force at any time obstructed a dangerous motion which they seem'd to be upon, they would roar exceedingly.

All the <hi>Three</hi> Children were vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited with some Return of their Calamities; but the <hi>Boy</hi> was the Child which endured <hi>most</hi> in this <hi>New</hi> Assault. He had been for some While kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertained, with Mr. <hi>Baily</hi> at <hi>Watertown</hi> where he had enjoyed a long time of ease; the Devils having given him but little Disturbance, expect what was for a short while after his first coming there.

               <p>IN the year 1688. about Midsummer, it pleased the Lord to visit one of my child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren with a sore Visitation; and she was not only tormented in her <hi>Body,</hi> but was in great distress of <hi>Mind,</hi> Crying out, That <hi>she was in the</hi> dark <hi>concerning her Souls estate, and that she had mispent her precious time;</hi> She and we thinking her time was near at an end Hearing those Shrieks and Groans which did not only pierce the <hi>ears</hi> but <hi>Hearts</hi> of her poor <hi>Parents;</hi> now was a time for me to <hi>Consider</hi> with my self, and to look into my <hi>own</hi> heart and and life, and see how matters did there stand between God and my own soul, and see <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord was thus contending with me.</hi> And upon Enquiry I found cause to <hi>judge</hi> my self, &amp; to <hi>justify</hi> the Lord. This Affliction continuing some time, the Lord saw good then to <hi>double</hi> the affliction in <hi>smiting down</hi> another Child, and that which was most heart breaking of all, and did <hi>double</hi> this double affliction was, it was apparent and judged by all that saw them, that the <hi>Devil</hi> and his Instruments, had a hand in it.</p>
               <p>The consideration of this was most dreadful: I thought of what <hi>David</hi> said, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 14. if he feared so to fall into the hands of <hi>Men,</hi>

            <p>¶ In a <hi>Town</hi> which is none of the <hi>youngest</hi> this Countrey, there dwelt a very Godly at honest Man. who upon some Provocation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived very Angry and Threatning Expression from <hi>two women</hi> in the Neighbourhood; soo upon this, diverse of his <hi>Cattel</hi> in a strange man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner dyed; and the man himself sometimes was haunted with <hi>lights</hi> of the women as he thought encountring of him. He grew indisposed in his <hi>Body</hi> very unaccountably; and one day repaired unto a <hi>Church Meeting</hi> then held in the place, with a Resolution there to declare what he had
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:000486_0083_0FA671C6221C8F28"/>
met withal. The man was one of such Figure and Respect among them, that the <hi>Pastor</hi> singled out <hi>him</hi> for to <hi>pray</hi> in the Assembly before their breaking up. He pray'd with a more than usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al measure of both Devotion and Discretion, but just as he was coming to that part of his Prayer, wherein he intended to petition Heaven for the <hi>Discovery of Witchcrafts</hi> which had been among them, he sank down <hi>Speechless</hi> and <hi>Sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less;</hi> and was by his Friends carried away to a <hi>Bed;</hi> where he lay for two or three hours in horrible Distress, fearfully starting, and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and crying out <hi>Lord, I am stab'a!</hi> and now looking whilst to and fro, he said, <hi>O here are wicked persons among us, even among US;</hi> and he complained, <hi>I came hither with a full purpose to tell what I know, but now</hi> (said he) <hi>I ly like a Fool!</hi> Thus he continued until the Meeting was over, and then his Fits left him; only he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained very sore. One or two more such Fits he had after that; but afterwards a more <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi> sort of <hi>Porture</hi> was employed upon him. He was advised by a worthy man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The man had a Son invaded with the like <hi>Fits</hi> but God gave deliverance to him in answer to the Prayers of His people for him.</p>
            <p>¶ In the same Town, there yet lives a very pious Woman, that from another Woman of ill Fame, received a small gift, which was <hi>eaten</hi> by her.

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>We may first conclude, That the Devils are not meer <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:000486_0088_0FA671C95A955028"/>
which we all embrace. But I pray, What things were those that <hi>left their first estate,</hi> being now <hi>reserved in chains of darkness to the judgment of the great day?</hi> What things be those that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought our Lord for liberty to <hi>enter into the swine?</hi> But we have among our selves lately seen plain Demonstrations, That there are <hi>Spirits,</hi> which <hi>understand,</hi> and <hi>argue,</hi> and <hi>will;</hi> and which are the enemies of all that is <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>just,</hi> &amp; <hi>Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may, Secondly Conclude, That these <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils</hi> are an <hi>Army</hi> in our <hi>Air.</hi> They are called in <hi>Eph.</hi> 2 2. <hi>the power</hi> (or the Army) <hi>of the air.</hi> There are diverse Miles of <hi>Air</hi> encompassing of this Terraqueous <hi>Globe;</hi> to that <hi>space</hi> it is that the <hi>Devils</hi> are limited, since their <hi>High-Treason</hi> against the God that made them. Here it is that they have a <hi>Play-house,</hi> as well as a <hi>Prison;</hi> here they play all their <hi>devillish Pranks</hi> until the <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Fire</hi> shall begin to flame. Indeed, <hi>some</hi> Devils may keep more constantly to <hi>one</hi> countrey, and some to <hi>another.</hi> Hence we read of some in <hi>Marc.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>We may conclude, Thirdly, That these <hi>Devils</hi> are an <hi>Army</hi> under a <hi>Leader</hi> too. There is a <hi>Government,</hi> a <hi>Monarchy</hi> in the dark Regions; and hence in <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 24. we read about <hi>Belzebub, the</hi> Prince <hi>of devils.</hi> There you have

               </gap>est, by whom they were <hi>headed;</hi> and they are all now under his Command. We have Mention in the Sacred Oracles, of, <hi>the devil and his angels.</hi> This <hi>cheef devil</hi> is called by way of eminency, <hi>the</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; but he has innumerable <hi>Slaves,</hi> and <hi>Officers,</hi> and <hi>Emissaries,</hi> which are under an entire Subjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him. His Orders they all observe; and therefore, when we speak of <hi>the Devil,</hi> it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth each private <hi>Souldier</hi> as well as him that is <hi>principal Commander.</hi> We say, <hi>The Devil,</hi> as we say, <hi>The Turk,</hi> or <hi>The Spaniard;</hi> it means <hi>any</hi> or <hi>every</hi> part of that infernal <hi>Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous.</hi> As itis said in <hi>Ps.</hi> 34. 6. <hi>The Angel of the Lord encamps, i. e.</hi> the Whole Host of Angels are as <hi>One</hi> in it.</p>

            <p>If it be asked, <hi>How</hi> the Devils are our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries? In general they labour to do us all the mischief they can <hi>devise.</hi> They pursue our Hurt in all <hi>waie,</hi> and by all <hi>

               </hi> that is used here. Thus First, the Devils are our Adversaries as <hi>Accusers.</hi> Tis the Character of the Devil in <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 10. <hi>The</hi> Accuser <hi>of our Brethren, which</hi> accuseth <hi>them before God, day and night.</hi> He is called a <hi>Satan,</hi> and a D<hi>evil</hi> for this very Cause. The Devils are first our <hi>Tempters,</hi> and then our <hi>Accusers.</hi> They complain to God against us, that we do not <hi>fear</hi> Him, that we do not <hi>love</hi> Him, that we do not <hi>seek</hi> Him, as we ought to do: they represent our faults before the Lord, as things that make us unfit for any Mercy at His hands. There is a <hi>Court</hi> kept some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in the <hi>Invisible world,</hi> at which Devils endeavour to prefer as many <hi>Complaints</hi> as they they <hi>can</hi> against us. They first <hi>gett</hi> and then <hi>bring</hi> matters of Accusation which we might be <hi>Indicted</hi> and <hi>Condemned</hi> for.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Devils are our Adversaries as <hi>Destroyers.</hi> They <hi>plead</hi> and <hi>pray</hi> as so many <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourneys,</hi> that a <hi>Judgment</hi> may be granted against us all; and then they petition that <hi>they</hi> too may be the <hi>Executioners</hi> of it. Tis illustrated in <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 11. and 2. 5. <hi>Satan</hi> urges upon God against <hi>Job, put forth thine hand now, and touch his bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

A D<hi>evil</hi> is called a <hi>destroying Angel.</hi> They are D<hi>evils</hi> usually <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

are the Instruments of Divine Vengeance on the world. If it be asked, <hi>Why</hi> the devils are our Adversaries? There is a double Reason to be Assigned of it. One Reason of it is,</p>
            <p>Their <hi>Hatred of God.</hi> The Devils have sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off the <hi>Law,</hi> and the <hi>Rule</hi> of God; and they cannot bear that the <hi>Name</hi> of God should be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged in the world. <hi>GOD</hi> and the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils</hi> are sworn enemies to each other; and the Lord may say of them as in <hi>Zeh.</hi> 11. 8. <hi>My soul loathed them, and their soul also abhorred me.</hi> Now the poor Children of men, both do the <hi>Service</hi> of God, and have the <hi>Image</hi> of God. We do the <hi>Service</hi> of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Man is the <hi>Priest</hi> of the whole <hi>visible Creation.</hi> Tis by our <hi>Thoughts,</hi> tis by our <hi>Words,</hi> that all things else pay their Homage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the Lord. The <hi>Devil,</hi> that would be in the <hi>Throne</hi> of God, would ruine us, that God may no more have the <hi>Honour</hi> of a <hi>Father,</hi> or the <hi>Fear</hi> of a <hi>Master</hi> in the world. We also have the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi> of God. In our <hi>Nature</hi> there is <hi>much,</hi> in our <hi>Vertue</hi> there is <hi>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re</hi> of God's Likeness. The Devil is a <hi>Tigre;</hi> they report of that wild beast, it will tear the <hi>picture</hi> of a man, when it cannot reach the <hi>person</hi> of a man: There is a <hi>lively shadow</hi> as it were, of God, upon us; and this the Tigres of <hi>Hell</hi> cannot endure.</p>
            <p>A Second Reason of it is, their <hi>Envy</hi> at <hi>Man.</hi> The <hi>Devils</hi> behold <hi>Man</hi> exalted &amp; advanced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove themselves. Tis said of the <hi>Leviathan</hi> in
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000486_0092_0FA671D319C605C0"/>
               <hi>Job</hi> 41. 34. <hi>He beholdeth all high things.</hi> Tis ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in the <hi>Pope</hi> also, and lastly in the <hi>Devil.</hi> He cannot brook it, that any should be <hi>higher</hi> than himself. The Apostle intimates, that <hi>Pride</hi> was at first, <hi>the Condemnation of the Devil.</hi> Tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured, that the Devil being informed of God's decree to have a <hi>Man</hi> subsist in the Second Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the <hi>Trinity;</hi> this provoked him and his Accomplices to their Disobedience. However the Devil now sees <hi>Man Saved</hi> and <hi>himself dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; Man</hi> in the Bosom of God, and <hi>himself</hi> is the Bottom of <hi>Hell; Well</hi> now thinks he, <hi>I will do this</hi> Man <hi>all the spits I can.</hi>

            <p>There be <hi>three</hi> things that show the power of our Adversaries.</p>
            <p>First, The power of our Adversaries the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, lies in the <hi>Nature</hi> of them. Tis said in <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 12. <hi>We fight not against flesh &amp; blood</hi> only <hi>but against principalities, and Powers, and spiritual wickednesses.</hi> They are <hi>spiritual,</hi> and therefore <hi>powerful.</hi> The <hi>Spirituality</hi> of the <hi>Devils</hi> enables them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000486_0093_0FA671D3DEF2F940"/>
makes 'em ready to attack us and surprise us at unspeakable Disadvantages. The <hi>Divels</hi> are <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> and hence they count <hi>Iron but straw, &amp; bras<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> as rotten wood;</hi> they are <hi>Spirits,</hi> and so they <hi>excel in strength;</hi> when they seem afraid of little <hi>Spels</hi> and <hi>Charms,</hi> it is only a stratagem by which they seek to decoy us into their dreadful <hi>Power</hi> more than before. <hi>One</hi> of them let loose, perhaps could <hi>slaughter</hi> an Army of an hundred thousand in a night.</p>
            <p>Secondly. The <hi>Power</hi> of our Adversaries the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,</hi> lies in the <hi>Number</hi> of them. Even such little things as <hi>Mice,</hi> yea, and <hi>Lice</hi> have prov'd horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble plagues by becoming numerous. What then may the <hi>Devils</hi> be, whose Troops amount unto many <hi>Legions!</hi> How many <hi>devils</hi> can sometimes be spared, for the Vexation of <hi>one man!</hi> In the bowels of one afflicted child, I have heard that murmur made, <hi>There are two or three of us!</hi> Yea, we read in <hi>Luc.</hi> 8. 30. of a <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ion</hi> that kept a <hi>Garrison</hi> in one single person a <hi>a Legion</hi> contain'd twelve <hi>Thousand</hi> and five <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi> in it. Doubtless, there are far more <hi>Devils</hi> than there are <hi>Men</hi> in the world. They <hi>swarm</hi> like the Frogs of <hi>Egypt</hi> in every chamber of our houses. We can go, we can stir no where, but those wild <hi>Arabians</hi> will be upon us.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. The <hi>Power</hi> of our Adversaries the <hi>Devils</hi> lies in their <hi>Conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

their <hi>Agrement</hi> in their designs makes them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable. We are told in Mat. 12. 26. <hi>Satan <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Devils have <hi>Men</hi> on their side. All wicked <hi>men</hi> promote the ends of the <hi>devils.</hi> Tis said, <hi>The lusts of the</hi> devil <hi>they will do</hi> 'tis said. <hi>The divel works in the Children of disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi> And the Devils have <hi>Hearts</hi> on their side Our wicked <hi>hearts</hi> will favour and humour the <hi>devils</hi> in their attempts, and betray us into their hands. When they made their assault on our Savionr, tis said, <hi>They sound nothing in Him.</hi> But they find <hi>something</hi> in <hi>us,</hi> they find in us, an <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Prop.</hi> IV. The <hi>devils</hi> are also <hi>cruel</hi> Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our souls. The Divel is not only a <hi>Lion</hi> but a <hi>roaring,</hi> an hungry, an <hi>angry</hi> Lion. Yea according to that in <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 2. he is not only <hi>Lion,</hi> but a D<hi>ragon</hi> too. He will have no more mercy than a Lion, he will have no more mercy than a D<hi>ragon</hi> upon all that comes in the way of his cruel Clutches. 'Twas the description of the <hi>Chaldaans</hi> in Hab. 1. 6. <hi>That bitter and hast nation.</hi> To the <hi>devils</hi> does it much more belong they are a <hi>Bitter and a cruel nation.</hi> Never was there such a merciless and a pittiless <hi>Tyrant</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the <hi>devil</hi> is; nothing so much pleases that bloody monster, as the <hi>pain</hi> and the <hi>death</hi> of our unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000486_0095_0FA671D576066DD8"/>
souls; and he has no Masick like the <hi>groans of a deadly wounded man.</hi> What a Prodigy of Cruelty was that <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, who wished that <hi>all his people had but one neck, that he might cut it off at a blow!</hi> Why the <hi>cruel Devil</hi> not only <hi>wished,</hi> but in Paradise he <hi>had</hi> &amp; he <hi>did</hi> such an horrid thing. And it is he that inspires vile men with all the <hi>Cruelty</hi> that their <hi>Inquisitions,</hi> and their <hi>Tortures</hi> give exemple of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop.</hi> V. The Devils are likewise <hi>Restless</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries of our souls. They <hi>go about,</hi> they are always in <hi>Action,</hi> always in <hi>Motion,</hi> that they may undo the souls of men.</p>
            <p>The Devil <hi>goes about.</hi> So could he say of himself, in Job, 1. 7. <hi>I come from going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</hi> This Prince goes in <hi>Progress,</hi> rides the <hi>Circuit</hi> thro his whole Dominions to see how his work is carried on. And all that are under the Inspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of this <hi>Prime Vister</hi> are continually travell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and labouring too for the destruction of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal souls. They <hi>go about,</hi> but <hi>how?</hi> We read in <hi>Jude</hi> 6. they are <hi>kept in chains;</hi> Tis by some rendered, they are kept <hi>for</hi> chains: but suppose them <hi>in</hi> chains; their chains are so <hi>lengthened,</hi> &amp; yet so <hi>limited</hi> that they <hi>go about,</hi> just where and when, and how far the Permission of God shall give them leave.

               <p>There are two Lessons that we may learn from these things. We may say after the Apostle in 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>In this the children of God are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest and the children of the</hi> Devil.</p>
               <p>First. We may see from hence, <hi>who the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the devil</hi> are. <hi>Roaring</hi> Lions <hi>that go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout seeking whom they may devour,</hi> what are they but the creatures whom the <hi>Devil</hi> is a <hi>Sire</hi> unto?

               <p>We have two things now incumbent on us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let us <hi>Avoid</hi> the <hi>Roaring Lion,</hi> who <hi>goes about seeking whom he may devour.</hi> Let us not be willingly in the way of D<hi>evils,</hi> who are ever aiming at our Confusion.</p>
               <p>First. Let us <hi>get</hi> from the <hi>Roaring Lion,</hi> by a sincere <hi>Turning</hi> to God in Christ. Hear &amp; quake all you that are yet in your unregenerate estate; you are in the mouth of the <hi>Roaring Lion:</hi> Oh, how can you be satisfyed or contented there? In <hi>Conversion,</hi> we are told in <hi>Act.</hi> 29. 18. men are turned <hi>from the power of satan unto God.</hi> Man, thou art under the <hi>under the power of satan,</hi> until thou art <hi>born again.</hi> O save thy self before it be <hi>too late.</hi> One once being ready to be devoured <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="14" facs="unknown:000486_0099_0FA671DB5DB57800"/>
if thou art not quickly redeemed from the <hi>Lion,</hi> it will ere long be <hi>All too late! All too late!</hi> Quickly then Renounce the service of the D<hi>evil;</hi> Quickly loath, quickly leave all your Sins; Quickly run to God in Christ, and say unto Him as in <hi>Isa.</hi> 26. 13 <hi>O Lord our God, other lords be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides Thee have had dominion over us, but now we will make mention of Thy Name alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly. Let us <hi>Keep</hi> from the <hi>Roaring Lion,</hi> by a sincere <hi>Shunning</hi> of what will peculiarly bring us within his teach. Indeed every <hi>Lust,</hi> as it were surrenders us up unto the Devil: every time a man gratfies a <hi>Lust,</hi> a <hi>Devil</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited into the soul of that man; and by every <hi>

                     </gap>hew Act</hi> of it, he takes a <hi>new Hold</hi> of the soul. But some Vices there are which give the Devils <hi>peculiar</hi> opportunities to devour us Of these take heed with a more than ordinary Caution. Particularly,</p>
               <p>First. Beware of <hi>Discontent.</hi> The devils are are wonderfully <hi>discontented Spirits;</hi> and none more than <hi>discontented Persons,</hi> ly open to their Invasion and Annoyance. The <hi>discontented</hi> man is angry at <hi>God;</hi> it is a rage at <hi>God,</hi> it is a Fret at <hi>God,</hi> which discomposes him. We are told about the man that is <hi>angry</hi> at his <hi>Neighbour,</hi> in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 27. He <hi>gives place to the devil.</hi> How much more may this be said about the man who is <hi>angry at his maker?</hi> The <hi>devil finds a place</hi> in
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000486_0100_0FA671E02D1A5748"/>
the soul of such a man. Be not <hi>Angry</hi> at any <hi>Poverty,</hi> be not <hi>Angry</hi> at any <hi>Calumny,</hi> be not <hi>Angry</hi> at any <hi>Affliction</hi> whatsoever. D<hi>iscontent</hi> opens the doors of the soul for all the <hi>devils</hi> of Hell to enter in.</p>
               <p>Secondly. Beware of <hi>Idleness,</hi> If <hi>thou,</hi> art <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,</hi> know that the <hi>devil</hi> is not so; the <hi>Idle soul</hi> is an <hi>empty House;</hi> there happens to it that thing in <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 44. <hi>The unclean spirit walks</hi> to and fro, and <hi>comes and finds the house empty, then goeth he and taketh with himself seven other spirits, more wicked than himself, and they enter in.</hi> When the Devil finds an <hi>Idle</hi> person, he as it were, calls to more of his crue, <hi>Come here! come h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly. Beware of <hi>Bad Company.</hi> That is, (I had almost said) the greatest engine the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil has, to trepan the children of men withal An evil Companion is a <hi> Gin</hi> for a soul. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils will have thee fast enough, if thou <hi>walkest in the counsil of the ungodly, and standest in the way of</hi> Sinners, <hi>and sittest in the seat of the scornful.</hi> The Devils, nay, and the <hi>Gallows</hi> too, at length often devour those that bad Company shall seduce. Twas said to them of Old, D<hi>epart from the tents of the wicked men, lest the earth swallow you up. </hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000486_0101_0FA671E2D2AF4788"/>
Even so, <hi>Depart</hi> from the <hi>Knots, depart</hi> from the <hi>Cups</hi> of wicked men, <hi>lest the</hi> Devil <hi>swallow you up.</hi> Tis said in <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 20. <hi>A companion of fools shall be destroyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. Let us <hi>Resist</hi> the <hi>Roaring Lion</hi> who <hi>goes about seeking whom he may devour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Do you find the <hi>Devil</hi> ready to <hi>devour</hi> you? Be you as ready to <hi>oppose</hi> him. It is mentioned as a sore calamity in <hi>Psal.</hi> 109. 6. <hi>Let Satan stand at his right hand.</hi> Alas! This is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our souls; we have <hi>Satan at hand,</hi> seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to gripe us in his hideous clawes.</p>
               <p>How many <hi>Temptations</hi> does the <hi>Devil</hi> seek to to devour your souls withal? <hi>Temptations</hi> to <hi>Uncleanness</hi> and <hi>Worldliness</hi> are devouring of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. <hi>Temptations</hi> to <hi>Atheism</hi> and <hi>Blasphemy</hi> are devouring of others. Perhaps, Temptations to <hi>Self-Murder</hi> have near devoured some unhappy souls. O Remember whence all these <hi>Temptations</hi> do arise. These things are the <hi>Roarings</hi> of the Hellish <hi>Lion;</hi> and will you hearken to <hi>him?</hi> Is there any thing in these cursed <hi>Roarings</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade your Hearkning thereunto? What Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, what Advantage, do you think these horrid <hi>Roarings</hi> can propound?</p>
               <p>Come then, Resist the <hi>Temptations</hi> of this <hi>roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lion.</hi> Tis said in <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 7. Resist <hi>the devil, and he will flee from you.</hi> If you <hi>fly,</hi> he will be a <hi>Lion,</hi> if you <hi>fight,</hi> he will be a <hi>Gnat</hi> before you. <hi>Est</hi> Leo, <hi>si</hi> fugias; <hi>si</hi> stas, <hi>quasi</hi> musca <hi>recedit.</hi>

Your Encounters call for two Things.</p>
               <p>One is, your <hi>Watch.</hi> Hence tis here said, <hi>Be vigilant, because your adversary the devil, as a roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lion walketh about.</hi> When it was cry'd out unto the Champion of <hi>Israel</hi> in <hi>Judg.</hi> 16 20. <hi>The Philistines be upon thee, Sampson;</hi> Then <hi>he awoke out of his sleep.</hi> Thus it may be exclamed, <hi>The</hi> Lions <hi>are upon thee O soul.</hi> O how watchful, how wakeful should this cause thee to be. Be <hi>watchful</hi> against all <hi>the devices of the devil.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <hi>watchful</hi> in every <hi>place,</hi> be <hi>watchful</hi> in every <hi>thing;</hi> be jealous alwaies, <hi>Has not the devil now some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign upon me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Second is your <hi>Faith.</hi> Tis recorded in <hi>heb.</hi> 11. 33. some <hi>by</hi> Faith <hi>stopped the mouthes</hi> of <hi>Lions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tho thou shouldst be in a <hi>Denful</hi> of them, yet <hi>Faith,</hi> true <hi>Faith</hi> would muzzle them <hi>all.</hi> By <hi>Faith</hi> repair to Christ, who is the true <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> which meets and slayes the Lions that roar upon our souls. By <hi>Faith</hi> repair to the <hi>Rock,</hi> even to the <hi>Rock that is higher than I!</hi> Where you may sit and shout and laugh at all the Lions that roar in the Wilderness, and say, <hi>Where I am, there you</hi> cannot <hi>come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are particularly two sorts of devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Temptations,</hi> which I would conclude this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sourse with some sutable R<hi>eflections</hi> on.</p>
               <p>Temptations to <hi>Atheism</hi> and <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps do molest some among us; possibly, <hi>Terribilia
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000486_0103_0FA671E4B1B49430"/>
de DEO,</hi> and <hi>Horribilia de Fide:</hi> Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical Suggestions about our <hi>God</hi> &amp; our <hi>Creed,</hi> may cast some of us into grievous Agonies, these things make many a good man to say, <hi>I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weary of my life!</hi> What shall in this case be done?  My Advice is.</p>
               <p>Do not so much <hi>dispute,</hi> as <hi>deny</hi> the Injections of the wicked one. Don't give the devil so much honour as to <hi>argue</hi> &amp; <hi>parley</hi> about his sewd <hi>propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals.</hi> Refuse them presently, refuse them pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily; so you <hi>silence</hi> them. When once an <hi>Atheistic</hi> or <hi>Blasphemous</hi> Thought appears with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your Minds, immediately hiss it away, as the Priests did <hi>Uzziah,</hi> when they first saw the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosie in his <hi>Forehead.</hi> Let such Thoughts, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately occasion in you the savory &amp; gracious Thoughts that shall be just contrary thereunto. If the devil would have you think, <hi>There is</hi> no <hi>God,</hi> then without any more a do, spite the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil by such a Thought with an Ejaculation contradicting of it, <hi>Lord, I beleeve that thou art, and that thou art a</hi> Rewarder <hi>too.</hi> Don't object, <hi>What if there be</hi> no <hi>God?</hi> But suppose for once, That God <hi>is.</hi> Tis by far the <hi>safer</hi> Supposal of the two. And then try whether to <hi>Weary</hi> the devil be not the best way to <hi>Corquer</hi> him. Let every <hi>Fiery dart</hi> of <hi>Satan</hi> fetch an <hi>holy dart</hi> of Prayer &amp; Grace from thee, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil will soon be weary of his Methods.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="unknown:000486_0104_0FA671E529840188"/>
Temptations to <hi>Self-Murder,</hi> may likewise be fierce upon some unhappy people here. Tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most unaccountable, that at some times in some places here, melancholy distempered Ragings toward <hi>Self-Murder,</hi> have been in a manner <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical.</hi> And it would make ones hair stand, to see or hear what manifest Assistance the Devils have given to these <hi>unnatural Self-executions</hi> when <hi>once</hi> they have been begun. Tis <hi>too</hi> evident, that persons are commonly <hi>bewitch't</hi> or <hi>possess't</hi> into these unreasonable <hi>Phrensies.</hi> But What shall these hurried people do?  My Advice is,</p>
               <p>Don't <hi>Conceal,</hi> much less <hi>Obey</hi> the motions of your Adversary. Failing in this, made a poor man, after a faithful sermon in a Neighbouring Town, presently to drown himself in a pit that had not two foot of water in it. If you will not <hi>Keep,</hi> that is the way not to <hi>Take</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Counsil. Let not him <hi>tye</hi> your <hi>Tongues,</hi> and it is likely he will not <hi>gain</hi> your <hi>Souls.</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to a good <hi>God</hi> of the Dangers in which you find your selves; cry to Him, <hi>Lord, I am oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, undertake for me.</hi> Complain also to a wise <hi>Friend.</hi> Let some prudent and faithful Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour understand your Circumstances: Tis pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible you may thereby escape the <hi>Snares</hi> with which the cruel <hi>Fowlers</hi> of <hi>Hell</hi> hope to trepan you into their dismal Clutches for evermore.
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:000486_0105_0FA671E5DBD2C998"/>
Your Neighbours may do much for you, and may prove your <hi>Keepers</hi> if God shall please. It may be the <hi>unkindness</hi> of some Friend, may have thrown you into your present Madness. Now the <hi>Kindness</hi> of some Friend may prove the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote. <hi>Many times,</hi> a <hi>Natural Distemper,</hi> is that by which the Devil takes advantage to get the souls of Self-Destroyers into his bloody hands. In this case, for the tempted persons to <hi>disclose</hi> their <hi>Griefs,</hi> will be the way to <hi>obtain</hi> their <hi>cures.</hi> Their Neighbours ought now to consult a <hi>skilful Physician</hi> for them; and <hi>oblige,</hi> yea, <hi>constrain</hi> them to follow his Directions. When the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi> on &amp; <hi>by</hi> which the Devil works, are taken away, perhaps he may be starved out of doors. <hi>Many times,</hi> again, The sin of <hi>Slothfulness</hi> gives the Devil opportunity to procure the Self-De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the sluggard. In this case too, the Tempted person may be succoured by the <hi>stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers-by</hi> becoming sensible of their Circumstances. Their Neighbours may now <hi>compel</hi> them to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their business. A <hi>Calling,</hi> the <hi>Business</hi> of a <hi>Calling,</hi> is an Ordinance of <hi>God,</hi> sanctified by Him to deliver us from the evil spirits that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the <hi>empty house,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>most times,</hi> There may be some old and great <hi>Sin</hi> unrepented of, where Temptations to <hi>Self-Murder</hi> have a violence hardly to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, There was once a man among us, who in the horrours of Despair, uttered many dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:000486_0106_0FA671E69BD1B440"/>
speeches against himself, and would often particularly say, <hi>I am all on a</hi> light Fire <hi>under the wrath of God!</hi> This man yet never confess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any unusual sin, but this; that having gotten about Forty pounds by his Labour, he had <hi>spent</hi> it in <hi>wicked Company:</hi> but in his Anguish of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit he hanged himself. There was once a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man among us, who under Sickness had made <hi>vowes</hi> of a <hi>New Life;</hi> but apprehending some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in her conversation afterward, she sell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the distraction wherein she also hanged her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. And the Sin of <hi>Adultery</hi> and <hi>Drunkenness</hi> has more than once issued in such a destructive <hi>Desperation.</hi> In case of <hi>this</hi> or any <hi>such</hi> Guilt, <hi>Confession</hi> with <hi>Repenance</hi> affords a present Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. To fly from <hi>Soul-Terrour</hi> by <hi>Self-Murder,</hi> is to leap out of the <hi>Frying-pan</hi> into the <hi>Fire,</hi> Poor tempted People, I must like <hi>Paul</hi> in prison, cry with a loud voice unto you, <hi>Do your selves no harm;</hi> all may be well yet, if you will hearken to the Counsils of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>Do Thou, O God of peace,</hi> bruise <hi>Satan under our feet world without end,</hi> Amen.</p>

            </p>
            <p>By the ensuing <hi>Propositions</hi> we may state and shape this Truth aright in our minds.</p>
            <div n="1" type="proposition">
               <head>PROP. I.</head>
               <p>Such an Hellish thing there is as <hi>Witchcraft</hi> in the World. There are Two things which will be desired for the advantage of this Assertion. It should <hi>first</hi> be show'd,  WHAT Witchraft is;</p>
               <p>My Hearers will not expect from me an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <hi>Definition</hi> of the <hi>vile Thing;</hi> since the Grace of God has given me the Happiness to speak without <hi>Experience</hi> of it. But from Accounts both by <hi>Reading</hi> and <hi>Hearing</hi> I have learn'd to describe it so.</p>
               <p>WITCHCRAFT is the Doing of <hi>Strange</hi> (and for the most part <hi>III</hi>) Things by the help of <hi>evil Spirits, Covenanting</hi> with (and usually <hi>Representing</hi> of) the woful Children of men.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>Diabolical Art</hi> that <hi>Witches</hi> are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious for.</p>
               <p>First. <hi>Witches</hi> are the Doers of <hi>Strange</hi> Things They cannot indeed perform any proper <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;</hi> those are things to be done only by the <hi>Favourites</hi> and <hi>Embassadours</hi> of the LORD. But <hi>Wonders</hi> are often produced by them, though
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000486_0111_0FA671ED45539DF0"/>
chiefly such Wonders as the Apostle calls in 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>Lying wonders.</hi> There are <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Storms</hi> in the <hi>great</hi> World, and <hi>wonderful Wounds in</hi> the <hi>little</hi> World, often effected by these <hi>evil Causes.</hi> They do things which tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend the ordinary <hi>Course</hi> of Nature, and which puzzle the ordinary <hi>Sense</hi> of Mankind. Some <hi>strange</hi> things are done by them in a way of <hi>Real Production.</hi> They do really <hi>Torment,</hi> they do really <hi>Afflict</hi> those that their Spite shall extend unto. Other <hi>Strange</hi> Things are done by them in a way of <hi>Crafty Illusion.</hi> They do craftily make of the <hi>Air,</hi> the <hi>Figures</hi> and <hi>Colours</hi> of things that never can be truly created by them. All men might <hi>see,</hi> but, I believe, no man could <hi>feel</hi> some of the Things which the <hi>Magicians</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> exhibited of old.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> They are not only <hi>strange</hi> Things, but <hi>Ill</hi> Things, that <hi>Witches</hi> are the Doers of. In this regard also they are not the Authors of <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles:</hi> those are things <hi>commonly</hi> done for the <hi>Good</hi> of Man, <hi>alwaies</hi> done for the <hi>Praise</hi> of <hi>GOD.</hi> But of these <hi>Hell-hounds</hi> it may in a special man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be said, as in <hi>Psal.</hi> 52. 3. <hi>Thou lovest evil more than good.</hi> For the most part they labour to robb <hi>Man</hi> of his <hi>Ease</hi> or his <hi>Wealth;</hi> they labour to wrong <hi>God</hi> of His <hi>Glory.</hi> There is Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Creatures that they call <hi>White Whitches,</hi> which do only <hi>Good-Turns</hi> for their Neighbours. I suspect that there are none of that sort;
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000486_0112_0FA671ED60BEACD8"/>
but rather think, <hi>There is none that deeth good no, not one.</hi> If they <hi>do good,</hi> it is only that they <hi>may</hi> do <hi>hurt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly.</hi> It is by virtue of <hi>evil Spirits</hi> that <hi>Witches</hi> do what they do. We read in <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2, 2. about the <hi>Prince of the power of the air.</hi> There is confined unto the <hi>Atmosphere</hi> of our <hi>Air</hi> a vast <hi>Power,</hi> or <hi>Army</hi> of <hi>Evil Spirits,</hi> under the Government of a Prince who employes them in a continual Opposition to the Designs of GOD: The Name of that <hi>Leviathan</hi> who is the <hi>Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Segniour of Hell,</hi> we find in the Scripture to be <hi>Belzebub.</hi> Under the Command of that mighty Tyrant, there are vast <hi>Legions</hi> &amp; <hi>Myriads</hi> of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, whose <hi>Businesses</hi> &amp; <hi>Accomplishments</hi> are not all the same. Every one has his <hi>Post,</hi> and his <hi>Work;</hi> and they are all glad of an opportunity to he <hi>mischievous</hi> in the World. These are they by whom <hi>Witches</hi> do exert their Devillish and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Rage upon their <hi>Neighbours:</hi> And espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Two Acts concur hereunto. The <hi>First</hi> is, Their <hi>Covenanting</hi> with the Witches. There is a most hellish <hi>League</hi> made between them, with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies.</hi> The <hi>Witches</hi> promise to serve the <hi>Devils,</hi> and the <hi>Devils</hi> promise to <hi>help</hi> the Witches; <hi>How?</hi> It is not convenient to be related. The <hi>Second</hi> is, Their <hi>Representing</hi> of the Witches. And hereby indeed these are drawn into <hi>Snares</hi> and <hi>Cords</hi> of Death. The <hi>Devils,</hi> when they go upon the Errands of the <hi>Witches,</hi> do
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000486_0113_0FA671EE520F4A80"/>
hear their <hi>Names;</hi> and hence do <hi>Harmes</hi> too come to be carried from the <hi>Devils</hi> to the <hi>Witches.</hi> We need not suppose such a wild thing as the <hi>Transforming</hi> of those Wretches into <hi>Bruits</hi> or <hi>Birds,</hi> as we too often do.</p>
               <p>It should next be proved <hi>THAT</hi> Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft <hi>is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Being</hi> of such a thing is denied by many that place a <hi>great part</hi> of their <hi>small wit</hi> in deride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Stories that are told of it. Their chief Argument is, That they never <hi>saw</hi> any Witches, therefore there are <hi>none.</hi> Just as if you or I should say, We never met with any <hi>Robbers</hi> on the Road, therefore there never was any <hi>Padding</hi> there.</p>
               <p>Indeed the <hi>Devils</hi> are loath to have true No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Witches</hi> entertained with us. I have beheld them to put out the eyes of an enchaunted Child, when a Book that proves, <hi>There is Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft,</hi> was laid before her. But there are espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Two Demonstrations that evince the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Infernal mysterious thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First.</hi> We have the Testimony of <hi>Scripture</hi> for it. We find <hi>Witchcrafts</hi> often mentioned, sometimes by way of <hi>Assertion,</hi> sometimes by way of <hi>Allusion,</hi> in the Oracles of God. Besides that, We have there the History of diverse <hi>Witches</hi> in these infallible and inspired Writings. Particularly, the Instance of the <hi>Witch</hi> at <hi>Endor,</hi> in 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 7. is so plain and full that
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000486_0114_0FA671EED93143B8"/>
                  <hi>Witchcraft</hi> it self is not a more amazing thing, than any <hi>Dispute</hi> about the Being of it, after this. The Advocates of <hi>Witches</hi> must use more <hi>Tricks</hi> to make Nonsense of the <hi>Bible,</hi> than ever the <hi>Witch</hi> of <hi>Endor</hi> used in her Magical Incantations, if they would evade the Force of that famous History. They that will believe no <hi>Witches,</hi> do imagine that <hi>Jugglers</hi> only are meant by them whom the Sacred Writ calleth so. But what do they think of that Law in <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 18. <hi>Thou shalt not suffer a Witch to live?</hi> Methinks 'tis a little too hard to punish every silly <hi>Juggler</hi> with so great S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>rity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> We have the <hi>Testimony</hi> of <hi>Experience</hi> for it. What will those <hi>Incredulous,</hi> who must be the only <hi>Ingenious</hi> men say to This? Many <hi>Witches</hi> have like those in <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 18. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed and shewed their Deeds</hi> We see those things done, that it is impossible any <hi>Disease,</hi> or any <hi>Deceit</hi> should procure. We see some hideous <hi>Wretches</hi> in hideous <hi>Horrours</hi> confessing, <hi>That they did the Mischiefs.</hi> This Confession is often made by them that are owners of as much Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son as the people that laugh at all <hi>Conceit</hi> of <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

This <hi>Confession</hi> is often made by them that are apart One from another, and yet they <hi>agree</hi> in all the Circumstances of it. <hi>T</hi>his <hi>Confession</hi> is often made by them that at the same time will

               <p>WITCHCRAFT is a most Monstrous and Horrid <hi>Evil.</hi> Indeed there is a vast Heap of bloody roaring Impieties contained in the <hi>Bowels</hi> of it. <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> is a Renouncing of <hi>GOD,</hi> and Advancing of a filthy <hi>Devil</hi> into the Throne of the Most High; 'tis the most nefandous <hi>High-Treason</hi> against the MAJESTY on High. <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> is a Renouncing of <hi>Christ,</hi> and Preferring the Communion of a loathsome lying <hi>Devil</hi> before all the Salvation of the Lord Redeemer; 'tis a Trampling under foot that <hi>Blood</hi> which is more precious than <hi>Hills</hi> of <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> or whole <hi>Mountains</hi> of <hi>Gold.</hi> There is in <hi>Witchraft,</hi> a most explicit <hi>Renouncing</hi> of all that is <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Just</hi> and <hi>Good.</hi> The <hi>Law</hi> given by <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Prayer</hi> taught by <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>Creed</hi> left by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> is become Abominable where <hi>Witchcraft</hi> is embraced: The very Reciting of those blessed Things is commonly burdensome where <hi>Witchcraft</hi> is.

is that of <hi>wickedness,</hi> whose <hi>work</hi> is that of <hi>Iniquity.</hi> Those persons do what is <hi>like Witchcraft</hi> every day.</p>
               <p>For, <hi>First.</hi> In <hi>Rebellion,</hi> men cast off the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of God<hi>:</hi> The <hi>Witch</hi> declares a Will to be no more disposed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ordered by the Will of <hi>God;</hi> she says, <hi>God shall not be my Governour.</hi> Such is the Language of <hi>Rebellion.</hi> When men <hi>rebel</hi> against God. They say like him in <hi>Exod.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>I know not the Lord, and I will not obey His voice.</hi> They say like them in <hi>Jer.</hi> 44. 16. <hi>As for the word—spoken—in the Name of the Lord, we will not hearken thereunto.</hi> There is indeed a sort of <hi>Atheism</hi> in <hi>Rebellion</hi> The Sinner is a <hi>Fool</hi> that wishes, <hi>O that there were no God!</hi> that resolves, <hi>God shall not be Lord over me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> In <hi>Rebellion</hi> men Refuse the <hi>Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> The <hi>Witch</hi> contemns all the Offers of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and prizes the dirty proffers that <hi>Satan</hi> makes before them all. This is the plain English of <hi>Rebellion;</hi> it sayes, <hi>What is tendred by the</hi> Devil, <hi>is better than what is tendred by the</hi> Saviour. The LORD said about <hi>Israel</hi> of old in <hi>Psal.</hi> 81. 11. Israel <hi>would none of Me.</hi> Thus 'tis when men <hi>rebel</hi> against God. A <hi>Jesus</hi> may say, <hi>Those poor creatures will have none of Me, nor of My Bloud.</hi> A <hi>Pardon</hi> may say, <hi>Those guilty creatures will have none of me.</hi> A <hi>Kingdom</hi> may say, <hi>Those undone creatures will have none of me.</hi> Where <hi>Sin</hi> is committed, there <hi>Christ</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised. This doleful <hi>Phrensy</hi> is in all <hi>Rebellion</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:000486_0118_0FA671F724D03990"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly.</hi> In <hi>Rebellion</hi> men <hi>choose</hi> and <hi>serve</hi> the the <hi>Devil</hi> as their Lord. The <hi>Witch</hi> makes an horrible Agreement with <hi>Devils,</hi> to be <hi>theirs</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. This is the intent of all <hi>Rebellion</hi> too. It in short saies, <hi>Let the</hi> Devil <hi>rule;</hi> it sayes, <hi>Let the</hi> Devil <hi>be humour'd and gratify'd.</hi> As that cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly King said unto the <hi>Syrian,</hi> 1. <hi>King.</hi> 20. 4. <hi>My Lord, O King, I am thine and all that I have.</hi> Thus the ungodly man saves unto the Devil; <hi>Thou art my Lord and my King.</hi> All <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi> against God, is in <hi>Obedience</hi> to the <hi>Devil.</hi> When men <hi>rebel,</hi> they lay their <hi>Wit,</hi> their <hi>Love,</hi> their <hi>Strength,</hi> and all the Instruments of that Rebellion before the Devil, and they say, <hi>This is</hi> thine, <hi>O Satan, and all that they have.</hi> They do even <hi>sell themselves to the Devil!</hi> as we read of one, <hi>He sold himself to work wickedness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly.</hi> In <hi>Rebellion,</hi> Men cast the <hi>Bond</hi> and the <hi>Good</hi> of their <hi>Baptism</hi> behind their Back. Among the Customs of <hi>Witches,</hi> this is one, They <hi>Renounce</hi> their <hi>Baptism</hi> in a manner very Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical. The same thing is done in the <hi>Rebellion</hi> of a wicked man. We are told in 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. that the thing which renders <hi>Baptism</hi> available is <hi>The answer of a good Conscience.</hi> But in <hi>Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> against God, men give the answer of an <hi>Evil</hi> Conscience, and so make a <hi>Nullity</hi> of their Sacred, Baptism. The Demand of God is, <hi>Wilt thou Beleeve as Baptised persons do profess to do?</hi> The <hi>Rebel</hi> answers, <hi>No, I will continue shutt up in my Unbeleef.</hi> The Demand of God is, <hi>Willt
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000486_0119_0FA671F7DE90E3E0"/>
thou put on Christ, as the Baptised profess to do?</hi> The <hi>Rebel</hi> answers, <hi>No, I will put on the old man.</hi> The Almighty God puts that Question, <hi>Wilt thou forsake the</hi> World, <hi>the</hi> Flesh, <hi>and the</hi> Devil, <hi>as thy</hi> Baptism <hi>dos oblige to do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> In <hi>Rebellion</hi> the Answer of sinful man, is, <hi>No, I will serve them all; they shall all be the Idols of my Soul.</hi> With what Conscience can they answer so! But thus their <hi>Baptism</hi> is nothing with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fiftly.</hi> All that <hi>rebel</hi> against God, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Mischievous</hi> in doing so. They are <hi>Mischiefs</hi> that <hi>Witches</hi> are delighted in. Thus 'tis the end of <hi>Rebellion</hi> to bring <hi>destruction</hi> upon all that are near unto it. 'Tis said in <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9. 18. <hi>One sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> destroyeth <hi>much good.</hi> It is the ill-Hap of <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> like <hi>Witches</hi> to <hi>do hurt</hi> wherever they come; they <hi>hurt</hi> the <hi>souls</hi> of their Neighbours by the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome of their <hi>Evil Communication;</hi> they <hi>hurt</hi> the <hi>Names</hi> of their Neighbours by their <hi>slandrous Defamation;</hi> they <hi>hurt</hi> their <hi>Estates</hi> by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the fiery Judgments of Heaven upon all the Neighbourhood. Unto <hi>Rebellion</hi> against God, are owing all the Distresses and Miseries of a calamitous World. This is the <hi>Achan,</hi> this is the <hi>Troubler</hi> of us all.</p>
               <p>The Improvement of these things now calls for our <hi>Earnest Heed;</hi> and unto each of our Three Propositions, we may annex <hi>Applications</hi> agreeable thereunto. I begin with</p>
               <p>The USE of the <hi>First Proposition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:000486_0120_0FA671F89CF06E98"/>
1. By way of <hi>INFORMATION.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are especially Two <hi>Inferences</hi> to be drawn from this Position, <hi>That, Such a thing there is as</hi> Witchcraft <hi>in the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>[First.] Since there are <hi>Witches,</hi> we are to suppose that there are <hi>Devils</hi> too. Those are the Objects that <hi>Witches</hi> converse withal. It was the Heresy of the ancient <hi>Sadducees</hi> in <hi>Act.</hi> 23. 8. <hi>The</hi> Sadducees <hi>do say, That there is neither Angel nor spirit.</hi> And there are multitudes of <hi>Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cees</hi> yet in our dayes; <hi>Fools,</hi> that say, <hi>Seeing is Beleeving;</hi> and will <hi>beleeve</hi> nothing but what they <hi>see.</hi> A <hi>Devil,</hi> is in the apprehension of those Mighty acute Philosophers, no more than a <hi>Quality,</hi> or a <hi>Distemper.</hi> But, as <hi>Paul</hi> said unto Him of old, <hi>King</hi> Agrippa, <hi>Beleevest thou the Prophets?</hi> Thus I would say, <hi>Friend, Beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thou the Scriptures?</hi> I pray, What sort of things were they, of whom we read in <hi>Jude.</hi> 6.? <hi>Angels that kept not their first estate, but left their own Habitation, and be reserved in chains unto the judgment of the great day.</hi> What sort of things were they, who in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 16. <hi>Besought</hi> our Lord, <hi>If thou cast us out, suffer us to go into the herd of swine?</hi> What thing was that, which in <hi>Luc.</hi> 4. 33. cryed out unto the Lord Jesus with a loud voice, <hi>Let us alone?</hi> Surely, These things could be none but <hi>Spiritual and rational substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, full of all</hi> Wickeness <hi>against God, and</hi> Enmity <hi>against Man.</hi> We shall come to have no <hi>Christ</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:000486_0121_0FA671F979F7B0F0"/>
but a <hi>Light within,</hi> and no <hi>Heaven</hi> but a <hi>Frame of mind,</hi> if the Scriptures must be expounded af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Rules of the modern <hi>Sadducees.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps tho' the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are <hi>Fables</hi> to that sort of men. Come then, thou <hi>Sadducee,</hi> What kind of thing is that which will so handle to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ingenuous well-disposed persons, That if any <hi>Devotions</hi> be performed, they shall <hi>roar</hi> &amp; <hi>tear</hi> unreasonably, and have such <hi>Noises</hi> and such <hi>Tortures</hi> in them, as not only to hinder them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>wholly,</hi> but others <hi>too much</hi> from joyning in the Service; and strive to <hi>kick</hi> or <hi>strike</hi> the Minister in his Prayers, but have their <hi>hands</hi> or <hi>feet</hi> strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stopt when they are just come at him, and yet be quiet before and after the <hi>Worship?</hi> That if any <hi>Idle</hi> or <hi>Useless</hi> Discourse be going, they shall be well, but at any <hi>serious</hi> Discourse they shall be tormented in all their Limbs? That If a portion of the <hi>Bible</hi> be readd, tho they <hi>see</hi> and <hi>hear</hi> nothing of it, and tho, it may be, in <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Hebrew</hi> too, they shall fall into terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Agonies, which will be over when the <hi>Bible</hi> is laid aside? That they shall be able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use whole <hi>Pages</hi> of <hi>Evil Books,</hi> but scarce a <hi>Line</hi> of a <hi>good one?</hi> That they shall <hi>Move</hi> and <hi>Fly,</hi> and <hi>Tell secret things,</hi> as no ordinary mortals can? Let me ask, <hi>Is not the hand of</hi> Joab <hi>in all this?</hi> or, Is there not a <hi>Divel</hi> whose Agency must account for things that are so extravagant? I am now to tell you, <hi>That these eye, of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ine have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000486_0122_0FA671FBB04963A0"/>
held all these things,</hi> and many other more, no less amazing. Christian, There are <hi>Devils:</hi> and so many of them too, that sometimes a <hi>Legion</hi> of them are spar'd for the vexation of <hi>one man.</hi> The <hi>Air</hi> in which we breath is full of them. Be sensible of this, you that <hi>obey God:</hi> there are Troops of <hi>Tempters</hi> on every side of thee. <hi>Awake,</hi> O Soul, Awake, Those <hi>Philistines</hi> of Hell <hi>are upon thee.</hi> Upon the least affrightment in the dark, many simple people cry out, <hi>The Devil! The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil!</hi> Alas, there are <hi>Devils</hi> thronging about thee every day. O let the thought of it make then a careful and a watchful man. And be sensible of this you that <hi>commit Sin:</hi> the Lord Jesus hath said of you, <hi>Ye will do the lusts of your father the</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. How often do many of you make a <hi>Mock</hi> and a <hi>Jeer</hi> of the Devil while you are drudging for him? But know, that there are dreadful <hi>Devils</hi> to seize upon thy forlorn forsaken soul, at its departure hence. O become a new man at the thought of this.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Since there are <hi>Witches</hi> and <hi>Devils,</hi> we may conclude that there are also <hi>Immortal Souls. Devils</hi> would never contract with <hi>Witches</hi> for their Souls if there were no such things to be come a prey unto them. One of the <hi>Popes</hi> when he lay dying, said, <hi>I shall now quickly know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I have an</hi> Immortal Soul <hi>or no.</hi> Within less than a hundred years, you &amp; I shall be convinced of it, if we are not so before. We may truly
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000486_0123_0FA672007AFB5D80"/>
say, <hi>Devils</hi> &amp; <hi>Witches</hi> bear a witness against them that have any scruple of it. There are some dreaming Hereticks, that hold <hi>Man wholly mortal:</hi> I am sure the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> was not of their <hi>beast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> Opinion, when he said in <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be dissolved and to be with Christ.</hi> Nor was the Martyr <hi>Stephen</hi> of their Opinion, when he expired, saying, in <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 59. <hi>Lord Jesus Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my spirit.</hi> Nor was our Lord Jesus Himself of that opinion, when He said unto the Theef on the Cross in <hi>Luc.</hi> 23. 43. <hi>This day thou shalt the with Me in Paradise.</hi> Tis an Opinion unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a man that is owner of a <hi>Soul.</hi> The mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken <hi>Indians,</hi> when first they saw a man on Horse-back, did conceit the <hi>Man</hi> and the <hi>Horse</hi> to be <hi>one</hi> Creature: it is as soul an Error to conceit that it is but <hi>one thing</hi> which man consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of. No, 'Tis a right <hi>Anatomy</hi> of <hi>man,</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>The Lord God formed man out of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living</hi> SOUL Remember, Thou hast in thee a <hi>living soul;</hi> or a <hi>Spirit,</hi> able to <hi>know,</hi> and <hi>will,</hi> and <hi>argue</hi> so as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothing else in the <hi>visible Creation</hi> can. This <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving soul</hi> is the <hi>Candle of the Lord</hi> within thee, and no Wind, no Death can ever extinguish it. O make much of this <hi>living</hi> SOUL. <hi>Save</hi> it, and don't <hi>sell</hi> it: It is a <hi>Jewel</hi> too precious to be thrown away. Do not <hi>sell</hi> thy <hi>soul</hi> for a <hi>

II. By way of <hi>Exhortrtion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is one thing to be now pressed upon us all.</p>
               <p>Let us wisely endeavour to be preserved from the Molestations of all <hi>Witchraft</hi> whatsoever. Since there is a thing so dangerous, <hi>defend</hi> your selves, and <hi>shelter</hi> your selves by all <hi>right</hi> means against the annoyance of it.</p>
               <p>Consider the <hi>Multitudes</hi> of them, whom <hi>Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft</hi> hath sometimes given <hi>Trouble to.</hi> Persons of <hi>all sorts</hi> have been racked and ruin'd by it: and not a <hi>few</hi> of them neither. It is hardly twenty years ago, that a whole Kingdom in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> was alarum'd by such potent <hi>Witchcrafts,</hi> that some hundreds of poor Children were inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with them. Persons of great <hi>Honour</hi> have sometimes been cruelly <hi>bewitched.</hi> What lately befell a worthy <hi>Knight</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> is well known unto the world. Persons of great <hi>Vertue</hi> too, have been bewitched, even into their Graves. But Four years are passed since a holy man was kill'd in this doleful way, after the <hi>Joy</hi> as well as the <hi>Grace</hi> of GOD had been wonderfully fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him. This Consideration should keep us from <hi>censuring</hi> of those that <hi>Witchcraft</hi> may give Disturbance to<hi>:</hi> but it should put us on <hi>study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of our own security. <hi>Suppose ye</hi> that the <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted Family</hi> in the Town, <hi>were sinners above all</hi> the Town, <hi>because they have suffered such things. I tell ye Nay, but except ye repent, ye may</hi> all <hi>be so dealt withal.</hi> The Father of <hi>Lies</hi> uttered an aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:000486_0125_0FA672025D2E7968"/>
Truth when he said through the mouth of a possessed man, <hi>If God would give me leave, I would find enough in the best of you all, to make you all mine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Consider also, the <hi>Misery</hi> of them whom <hi>Witchcraft</hi> may be <hi>let loose</hi> upon. If <hi>David</hi> thought it a sad thing to <hi>fall into the hands of</hi> men; What is it to <hi>fall into the hands of</hi> Devils? The Hands of <hi>Turks,</hi> of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> of <hi>Indians,</hi> are not so dreadful as those hands that <hi>Witches</hi> do their <hi>works of Darkness</hi> by. O what a direful thing is it, to be prick't with <hi>Pins,</hi> and stab'd with <hi>Knives</hi> all over, and to be fill'd all over with <hi>broken Bones?</hi> 'Tis impossible to reckon up the Varieties of miseries which those Monsters inflict where they can have a Blow. No less than <hi>Death,</hi> and that a languishing and a terrible <hi>Death</hi> will satisfie the Rage of those formidable Dragons. Indeed <hi>Witchcraft</hi> sometimes growes up into <hi>Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session</hi> it self: the Devils that are permitted to <hi>torment,</hi> at last do possess the <hi>Bodies</hi> of the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched sufferers.</hi> But who can bear the thoughts of that! who can forbear crying out, <hi>O Lord, my flesh trembles for fear of Thee, and I am afraid of Thy Judgements.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What shall then be done for our <hi>Preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi> Away with all <hi>superstitious</hi> Preservatives; about <hi>those</hi> Confidences the Word of God is that in <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 37. <hi>Thou shalt not prosper in them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there are Three admirable <hi>Amulets</hi> that
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:000486_0126_0FA672031F00CC50"/>
I can heartily recommend unto you all.</p>
               <p>The First Preservative is, <hi>A servent</hi> PRAYER. Pour out that <hi>prayer</hi> before the Lord, in <hi>psal,</hi> 59 2, 3. <hi>Deliver me from the workers of</hi> Iniquity, <hi>and save me from the bloody ones; for lo, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The Devils are <hi>afraid</hi> of our <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;</hi> they tremble and complain, and are in a sort of <hi>Anguish</hi> while our <hi>Prayers</hi> are going. There was a house of a Renowned Minister in <hi>France</hi> infested with <hi>evil Spirits;</hi> who tho' they had been very troublesome, yet when the good man was betaking himself to prayer, they would say, <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>w you are going to</hi> Prayer, <hi>I'll be gone.</hi> Let us <hi>Pray</hi> much, and we need <hi>fear</hi> nothing particularly, Let <hi>Ejaculatory</hi> Prayers be almost continually in our minds, and so we shall never ly open to the <hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Second Preservative is <hi>A lively Faith.</hi> The Psalmist <hi>well</hi> said, in <hi>Psal.</hi> 56. 2, 3, <hi>Mint enemies would daily swallow me up; At what time I am afraid I will trust in thee.</hi> Be not <hi>afraid of</hi> any <hi>Devils;</hi> If you are, turn the <hi>Fear</hi> into <hi>Faith.</hi> By <hi>Faith</hi> resign your selves to the Cust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ody of Him that is <hi>the Keeper of Israel.</hi> By <hi>Faith</hi> perswade yourselves that <hi>He is able to keep what you have committed unto Him.</hi> Thus, Run to the <hi>Rock,</hi> and there triumph over all the <hi>powers of darkness.</hi> Triumph and say; <hi>The Lord is on my side; I will not fear: What can Hell do unto me.</hi>

The Third Preservative is, <hi>A Holy Life.</hi> There was a very <hi>Holy</hi> Man of old, <hi>a man, that feared God &amp; eschewed evil;</hi> and the Devils mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur'd in <hi>Job,</hi> 1. 10. <hi>God has made on hedge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him.</hi> The same have the Devils confest, when they have plotted against other holy men. Do not thou break the hedge of God's <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,</hi> and perhaps he will not let any break the hedge of His <hi>Providence,</hi> by which thou art secured.

               </p>
               <p>Consider. First, There is a sort of <hi>Witchcraft</hi> charged on you. You shall as undoubtedly perish as any <hi>witch</hi> in the world, except you reform.

The Lord said unto some confident pretenders of old, <hi>Ye are as</hi> AEthiopians <hi>unto me.</hi> This doth God say unto all them that obey Him not; <hi>this</hi> doth He say to every one of you that do not <hi>fear Him</hi> &amp; <hi>keep His Commandment;</hi> He saith, <hi>Ye are as</hi> Witches <hi>unto me;</hi> though thy Birth be of godly or genteel <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi> tho thy Parts &amp; Gifts may be <hi>extraordinary,</hi> tho' thy <hi>Prayers</hi> may be <hi>twice a week,</hi> &amp; thy <hi>Alms</hi> enough to fill a <hi>Trumpet,</hi> yet become a <hi>new-creature;</hi> otherwise <hi>ye are as</hi> witches <hi>unto me, saith the Lord</hi>

                     </gap>ust</hi> has bewitched 'em. They that are bewitched, have a marvellous va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of calamity upon them. One while they can't <hi>see;</hi> that is <hi>thy</hi> case; <hi>Thou</hi> art wretched, but thou canst not <hi>see</hi> it; Christ is lovely, but thou canst not <hi>see</hi> him.

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Let not an Act of</hi> Rebellion <hi>be allowed by us.</hi> When <hi>Joseph</hi> was incited unto an <hi>Ill Act,</hi> he said, in <hi>Gen,</hi> 39. 9. <hi>How shall I do this</hi> wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <hi>and sin against God?</hi> Thus, when we are urged unto any <hi>Ill Act,</hi> Let us refuse it so, <hi>No, this is like</hi> Wicthcraft, <hi>shall I by such</hi> wickedness <hi>make my self as a</hi> Witch <hi>before the Lord?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Three Things are to be Recommend here.</p>
               <p>First. <hi>Arm</hi> yourselves against all the <hi>Devices,</hi> with which the <hi>Devils</hi> would hook you into any <hi>Rebellion</hi> against the Lord. For Rebellion against <hi>God,</hi> there will be that clause in our <hi>Indictment,</hi> They <hi>were moved by the Instigation of the</hi> Devil. Now furnish yourselves with <hi>Armour</hi> to keep off the Dint of the <hi>Devils Instigations;</hi> in short, <hi>put on the whole Armour of God.</hi> There is specially a <hi>double Care</hi> that will be of great use in your En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters.</p>
               <p>First. Use your <hi>Watch</hi> well. We read in <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 11. about, the <hi>Wiles</hi> of the <hi>Devil.</hi> When the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil would engage us in a <hi>Rebellion,</hi> there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Wily Methods</hi> by which he doth accomplish
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:000486_0142_0FA6721883789C60"/>
it. He works more by <hi>Fraud</hi> than by <hi>Force;</hi> and there is a <hi>cryptic method</hi> by which he doth gain us over to himself. A crafty Sophistor has a <hi>three-fold Method</hi> with which he prevails upon his Auditors; and such the Method of the <hi>Devil</hi> is. <hi>Watch,</hi> First, against the <hi>Deficient</hi> method of the Devil. The Devil will show us the Sin <hi>without</hi> the <hi>Curse,</hi> the Bait <hi>without</hi> the <hi>Hook:</hi> So he saies <hi>Eat the pleasant Fruit;</hi> but he saies not, <hi>Thou shalt</hi> dye <hi>if thou do it.</hi> The Devil will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present unto us the <hi>Difficulty</hi> of a Duty, but <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal</hi> the <hi>recompence</hi> of it. So he says, <hi>It's a hard thing to pray</hi> in <hi>secret every day;</hi> but he says not, <hi>Thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will</hi> Reward <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e.</hi> And he will represent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us the <hi>Excuse</hi> of a Sin, but <hi>conceal</hi> the <hi>Ill shape</hi> of it: So he saies, <hi>Many others have done this and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> but he saies not, <hi>God was</hi> Provoked at it. These are Tricks to be <hi>watched</hi> against.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Watch,</hi> Secondly, against the <hi>Redundant</hi> Method of the Devil. Sometimes the devil will use a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression.</hi> He will seem to give over his <hi>Intent</hi> in one thing, but make sure of his Intent in another. Such a Stratagem he uses as what <hi>Joshua</hi> took <hi>Ai</hi> withal; he <hi>retires,</hi> and so he <hi>conquers.</hi> He will make <hi>Haughtiness</hi> and <hi>Security</hi> undo the soul, that he could not make of his party for <hi>grosser Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> Sometimes the devil will use a <hi>Commoration.</hi> He will dog a man, and bring Perswasion upon perswasion, as <hi>Delilah</hi> did with <hi>Sampson;</hi> and
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:000486_0143_0FA67219624FAD18"/>
like a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nuning <hi>Fencer,</hi> he <hi>repeats</hi> blow after blow, till he smite home. These are Dangers to be <hi>Watched</hi> against.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Watch,</hi> Thirdly, against the <hi>Inverting</hi> Method of the Devil. One while the Devil will endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to carry us on from <hi>Lesser</hi> sins to <hi>Greater</hi> sins. He will go to make our miscarriages like <hi>Elijah'</hi>s cloud; at first as an <hi>Hands-breadth,</hi> but anon so as to hide the whole <hi>Heaven</hi> from us. So <hi>Solomon</hi> multiplies first <hi>Horses,</hi> &amp; afterward <hi>worse</hi> things against the command of God. Another while, the Devil will decoy us from <hi>lawful</hi> things to <hi>unlawful</hi> things. Thus from a <hi>Good-husband,</hi> a man shall grow a meer <hi>Muck-worm.</hi> Now and then also, the Devil will try to spoil <hi>Good works</hi> with <hi>Ill ends:</hi> Thus the <hi>Pride</hi> of <hi>Jehu</hi> shall be swell'd by the <hi>Zeal</hi> of <hi>Jehu.</hi> He will try to make our Duties <hi>Interfere;</hi> the <hi>general Calling</hi> shall be regarded in the season of the <hi>particular,</hi> and the <hi>particular calling</hi> shall be attended in the season of the <hi>general.</hi> He will try to lead us from one <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme</hi> to another; We shall be excessively <hi>merry,</hi> and ore long excessively <hi>melancholly,</hi> if we hearken to him. O keep up your <hi>Watch.</hi> Well did the Apostle say, in 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Be</hi> vigilant, <hi>for the</hi> Devil <hi>as a roaring lion, seeketh whom he may devour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly. Use your <hi>Sword</hi> well. Tis said in <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 17. <hi>Take the</hi> Sword <hi>of the Spirit which is the</hi> Word <hi>of God.</hi> The Devil cannot stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Brandishings of this <hi>Two-edged Sword.</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="unknown:000486_0144_0FA672199B43B898"/>
Our Saviour overcame the devil by making that Return, <hi>It is written,</hi> and <hi>It is written,</hi> against all his lewd attempts. Would he get you into any <hi>Rebellion?</hi> One <hi>Text</hi> well managed will make him fly before you. Would he have you be <hi>unjust?</hi> Then answer, It is written, <hi>The</hi> unrighteous <hi>shall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> Would he have you be <hi>unclean?</hi> Then answer, it is written, <hi>God reserves to be punished them that walk in uncleanness.</hi> Would he have you be immoderately <hi>careful?</hi> Say then, <hi>It is</hi> written, <hi>Cast thy burden on the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Warefare</hi> is directly contrary to that <hi>Witchcraft</hi> which the Devils are daily driving or drawing us unto.</p>
               <p>Secondly. Beware of <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> Rebellion against God particularly, which the <hi>Devils</hi> are <hi>most</hi> gratified withal. It is said in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 40. <hi>Grieve not the holy Spirit of God,</hi> The <hi>unclean devils</hi> are pleased most with such things as that <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> is most <hi>grieved</hi> with. Sometimes the Devils have been forced as it were, to discover their own Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: thro the mouths of <hi>possessed</hi> persons, they have declar'd what was very grateful to them. The Children that have lately been under a <hi>dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical Fascination</hi> in this Town, have given us diverse intimations, which we might make use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Observations on. I observed, that tho they had much <hi>delight in prayer</hi> when they were <hi>well;</hi> yet when they were <hi>ill,</hi> they could not endure it. The <hi>Damons</hi> would make them sing, &amp; roar, and
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:000486_0145_0FA6721A5AE4CBD0"/>
stop their ears, and plague them, and at last lay them for <hi>dead,</hi> if any prayer were in the Room. Whence it may be inferred, That you who can go without <hi>Prayer</hi> from day to day, do just as the <hi>Devils</hi> would have you. The Devils have an horrible <hi>Rendezvous</hi> in that <hi>Family,</hi> in that <hi>Closet,</hi> where <hi>Praye</hi> is not maintained. I observed, that tho the <hi>Word of God</hi> were their Companion &amp; <hi>Counsellor</hi> at other times, yet <hi>now</hi> they would fall into <hi>Convulsions,</hi> if one did but look into a <hi>Bible.</hi> Whence it may be suppos'd that you who <hi>read</hi> not the <hi>Scripture,</hi> for the most part every day, do humour the <hi>devils</hi> in it. The <hi>Devils</hi> are glad to see the <hi>Bibles</hi> that have <hi>dust</hi> upon them. I observed, that <hi>Haeretical,</hi> or <hi>Superstitious</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane</hi> Books, might be perused by some of them, when <hi>serious</hi> &amp; <hi>Orthodox</hi> Books would <hi>put out their Eyes.</hi> Whence it may be suggested, That you who converse much with <hi>ill</hi> books, do as the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils</hi> would: The Devils would willingly be where <hi>Jest-books</hi> &amp; <hi>Play-books,</hi> &amp; <hi>Romances,</hi> and <hi>Haeresies</hi> or <hi>Superstitions</hi> are made a Library. I observed, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> they were exemplary for <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty</hi> &amp; <hi>sobriety,</hi> yet now their Wishes to <hi>steal</hi> &amp; <hi>be drunk,</hi> were frequently expressed; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they were made very <hi>drunk</hi> tho no intox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icating <hi>Drink</hi> had bin in the least an occasion of it. Whence it may be gathered, That the <hi>Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> has a <hi>devil</hi> in him, the <hi>Stealer</hi> has a <hi>devil</hi> in him. The Devils have sport enough, when they
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:000486_0146_0FA6721B1A3F5858"/>
see a man Reeling in the streets; the <hi>divels</hi> are the Comrades of them that go to <hi>take what is none of their own.</hi> I observed, That tho <hi>few</hi> in the place were so <hi>diligent</hi> as <hi>they,</hi> nevertheless in their <hi>Fits</hi> they might not do any <hi>work</hi> at all.

            <p>SInce the Finishing of the History which concerns <hi>Goodwin'</hi>s Children, there has been a very wonderful Attempt made (brobably by <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> on another Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in the Town.) There is a poor Boy at this time under very terrible and amazing Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances which are a <hi>Repetition</hi> of, with not much <hi>Variation</hi> from those of the Children formerly molested. The person under vehement Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion to be the Authoress this Boy's Calamities, is one that was complain'd of by those Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in <hi>their</hi> Ails. and accordingly one or two of those Children has at this time some Renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of their Afflictions also; which perhaps may be permitted by the Great God, not to dissap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point our Expectations of their Deliverance, but for the <hi>Detection</hi> and the <hi>Destruction</hi> of more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to that hellish Knot, that has not yet pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished as others of the Crue has done, before the poor prayers of them that <hi>Hope in God.</hi>

            <head>APPENDIX</head>
            <p>THere are one or two passages in the first of our foregoing Histories, which I fore-see, (those usually no less <hi>Absurd</hi>) than <hi>Angry</hi> people) the <hi>Quakers,</hi> will <hi>come upon me with great wrath,</hi> for my writing of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Incivilities lately shown to my Father, for a peice of one Chapter in his Book of <hi>Remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable Providences,</hi> by one <hi>Keith,</hi> in sort of a thing newly published at <hi>pen-silvania,</hi> have made it necessary for me, not only to <hi>explain</hi> my self, but to <hi>defend</hi> him, upon the occasion that is now before me.</p>
            <p>As for what I have related concerning the strange liberty which the <hi>Devils</hi> gave unto <hi>John Goodwin's</hi> Children, to enjoy both the <hi>Writings</hi> and the <hi>Meetings</hi> of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> when offers thereof were (it may be too needlessly) made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

               </hi> what I do <hi>Affirm,</hi> whenever any man shall demand it of me; And that the Books with which the Tryal happned to be made, were more than <hi>one,</hi> and such, as the <hi>Quakers</hi> give as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral an Allowance to, as to their own <hi>Primers</hi> and their <hi>Catechisms.</hi> But undoubtedly, the match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Candour and Sweetness of the <hi>Quakers</hi> will inspire them, with Inclinations to give me some of <hi>their</hi> public Thanks for the notice I have taken of them; and in the mean time I must let my Neighbours understand, what ridiculous as well as odious Calumnies the <hi>Quakers</hi> have bestowed upon my absent <hi>Father,</hi> for his being an Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an (they think) unto their Prejudice.</p>
            <p>One would think. That if an <hi>Historian,</hi> did but secure his <hi>Veracity</hi> from being Impeached, most of his other faults were pardonable; and so tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they would be accounted, by any, besides <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> who are a people <hi>by themselves.</hi> But my Father had published a Book entituled, <hi>Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Providences;</hi> in one part of which, he has a Narrative of several very marvellous Occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that certain deluded and possessed <hi>Quakers,</hi> in this Countrey were concerned in. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Fact,</hi> never could be disputed; yet one <hi>Keith a</hi> Quaker, who had been <hi>compassing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

of <hi>Increase Mather,</hi> without committing more than a few himself. However, he is pleas'd to say, when he comes to talk, <hi>Let any of his kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred answer for him in his absence;</hi> and because I am <hi>somewhat a kin</hi> to the said <hi>Increase Mather,</hi> whom the <hi>Ani-mad-versions</hi> of this <hi>Keith</hi> have made such an Assault upon, that were I more dumb than the Son of <hi>Croesus</hi> himself, yet I must have <hi>spoken</hi> at the Provocation, I am willing to satisfie our little Authour so far as to Answer these <hi>Three</hi> Things upon him: Yet I would so far observe one of <hi>Solomon'</hi>s Rules in my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, as not to use upon him some Terms of <hi>his</hi> Art which as a <hi>Specimen</hi> of his breeding he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stows upon <hi>Increase Mather;</hi> but offer a few just Reflections on this <hi>new Apostle</hi> (no doubt a Successor to <hi>one</hi> of the old ones) unto the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First.</hi> He charges my absent Father, with <hi>Gross Abuses, Lyes, and Slanders;</hi> and yet he denies not the Truth of the Stories, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of which flings him into this foaming Rage. He charges him just as last year he did the rest of the Ministers of <hi>Boston.</hi> He sent us a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Challenge, which begins, <hi>I being well assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Spirit of God, that the doctrine ye preach to the People</hi> is <hi>false</hi>—and he then rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons up Twelve Articles (he says) of our Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, the <hi>Twelsth</hi> of which is directly contrary
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000486_0152_0FA672249E8A4878"/>
to what we assert, and maintain and preach eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day. This was his <hi>Inspiration</hi> then! and such is his <hi>Narration</hi> now. <hi>Increase Mather</hi> penns <hi>Truths,</hi> and yet, it seems writes <hi>Lyes</hi> But where is <hi>Increase Mather'</hi>s Crime? Why, our Animadvertor tells us, <hi>I. M. relates these stories on purpose to abuse the honest and sober people called</hi> Quakers, <hi>without making any Distinction</hi>—But what <hi>Metal</hi> is this man's Forehead made of? Reader, you shall find my Fathers intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to his Histories to be, <hi>All wise men that are acquainted therewith, observe the blasting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes of Heaven upon the late SINGING and Dancing Quakers.</hi> And his Inference from them is, That <hi>The Quakers are</hi> SOME <hi>of them undoubtedly possessed with evil spirits;</hi> and his Conclusion is, <hi>We may, by this, judge whose servants the</hi> Singing <hi>Quakers are.</hi> Behold how carefully he has Repeated the very <hi>Distinction</hi> which this waspish man complains at the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of! Besides, he had no need of making <hi>any</hi> Distinction at all. That the <hi>Quakers</hi> fall out among themselves, is but a natural Consequence of their <hi>Tempers</hi> and <hi>Errours,</hi> which cannot be otherwise than <hi>Incohaerent;</hi> and sometimes, their Credit forces them to <hi>Explode</hi> in one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, what they (wish they could but) can't <hi>Excuse.</hi> Tho it seems if a Woman dress her self like a <hi>Devil,</hi> and fright some of her Sex almost out of their Lives, on a <hi>Lords Day,</hi> in

               <hi>that</hi> Communion: we see the contrary. But the Stories Recorded by my Father, (plainly enough) demonstrate, That

Diabolical <hi>Possession</hi> was the Thing which did <hi>dispose</hi> and <hi>encline</hi> men unto <hi>Quakerism;</hi> Their <hi>Quakerism</hi> was the <hi>proper Effect</hi> of their <hi>Possession;</hi> and not an <hi>unconcern'd Consequent.</hi> 'Tis our Logicians Fault here, that he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils <hi>without making any Distinction;</hi> if he would have pleased to <hi>distinguish</hi> a little, he might have spared the pains of his tedious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions, about <hi>Charging the</hi> innocent <hi>with the crimes of the guilty.</hi> But from such a <hi>G.

For me to <hi>Commend</hi> my yet living Father would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he counted an Indecency.

discover in <hi>Increase Mather,</hi> that shall criminate my Vindication of an absent and a wronged Parent. My Reader's Patience must then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to tell him, that all <hi>New-England</hi> well knows, That <hi>Increase Mather</hi> never departed from hence, through any <hi>Rashness</hi> or <hi>Folly</hi> of his <hi>ewn,</hi> but through the <hi>Malice</hi> of <hi>unreasonable men.</hi> Our Charter being unjustly Vacated (which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>G. K.</hi> reckons among the Judgments of God upon us) the Government of this Territory was fallen into the hands of men that immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly took all sorts of measures to make us mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. A knot of people, that had no design but to enrich themselves on the <hi>ruines</hi> of this <hi>flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> plantation, were placed over us, &amp; <hi>our Land strangers devoured in our presence.</hi> The sight of our <hi>Calamities</hi> made my Father willing to undertake a Voyage unto <hi>England,</hi> for no other cause but meerly to endeavour the Service of his afflicted Countrey; and not a few among the principal Gentlemen of the place, did both <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vize</hi> and <hi>Assist</hi> his Undertaking. His Intent <hi>in</hi> Going he did not publish, but his Intent <hi>of</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he did; and he had no sooner done it, but one <hi>Randolph,</hi> the late <hi>Secretary,</hi> whom (like a <hi>Scavenger</hi>) our late Oppressors cheefly used in their more dirty Businesses, gave Trouble unto him to obstruct and prevent his Voyage. The Circumstances of it were these: This <hi>Randolph</hi> some time since, carried unto Sr. <hi>Lionel Jenkins,</hi> a

Letter which he assur'd him was Mr. <hi>Mather's;</hi> Tho the Letter was a most Villanous Forgery, Filled with Treason and Madness in the <hi>Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of it, and never was one line of it written by my Father. The Letter-Forger had so fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishly drawn it up, That <hi>Randolph</hi> could not get the <hi>Blood</hi> of the Gentleman, whom he (after his manner, that is) <hi>falsly</hi> Charged with being the <hi>Authour</hi> it, yet care was taken thereby to blast his <hi>Name:</hi> The <hi>Observator,</hi> (whom one calls <hi>The Father of Lyes</hi>) here became <hi>Nurse,</hi> &amp; printed it, with not a few scurrilous <hi>Observations</hi> on it. So that in all the Taverns and Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee-houses throughout Three-Kingdoms, this innocent Person was made a Ridicule, and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bados</hi> too, with other of the <hi>Lee-ward Islands,</hi> took this opportunity to spit their venome on one who had never done any thing to deserve it, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> by being (in the account of some that are <hi>Both</hi>) somewhat of a Learned and Honest man. My Father to Vindicate himself, while our old Government yet lasted, wrote a Letter to Mr. <hi>Dudley,</hi> who had from <hi>White-Hall,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Copy of that bloody Forgery; and in this Vindication, he intimates that several shrowd things would make him suspect <hi>Randolph</hi> himself to be the Director of it. It was Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent unto him That the whole forgery was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived for <hi>Randolph'</hi>s advantage; tis almost all <hi>of</hi> him and <hi>for</hi> him; but could any rational man imagine, that <hi>he</hi> was then wholly a stranger
