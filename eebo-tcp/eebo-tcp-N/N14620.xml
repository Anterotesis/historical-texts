            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE next ſtep of a Nation towards the happineſs of its individuals, after having ſtruggled for, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly obtained, its freedom, is to eſtabliſh Juſtice, which is generally obſtructed by party and lawleſs men, to gratify their private views during ſuch conteſt. It is not ſufficient in this country to eſtabliſh juſtice for the American-born ſons only, it muſt be alſo impartial for, or againſt, any naturalized men in the United States. Patriotiſm does not conſiſt in oppreſſing the dutiful emigrants to indulge the avidity of the rapacious countrymen, but to ſupport either, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured at home or abroad, by unjuſt powers.</p>
            <p>I ſubmit, with all poſſible humility, this Memorial to the judgment of the candid Reader; but I ſtand in the greateſt need of his indulgence, being under the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of not knowing thoroughly the language; obliged to ſpeak of myſelf, which always appears ſelfiſh; compelled to detect a number of artful men and parties, which may be ſuſpected from me as aſperſions againſt my enemies: All theſe conſiderations would have kept me a ſilent victim, was it not my duty to do my utmoſt to ſhew the injuſtice done to me, in order to warn others, if poſſible, in ſimilar circumſtances; and alſo the legiſlative power, that they may be enabled to prevent the ſame: being confident that the proofs thereof, I am about to give, are ſo obvious that every body who will read this Memorial, will be convinced that I was in fact ſacrificed.</p>

            <head>MEMORIAL, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>I Was born at St. Malo, city of France, and was admitted in the King's ſea-ſervice of that country in the capacity of Lieutenant of a Frigate, in the beginning of the year 1763, and had the misfortune to be dangerouſly wounded in an engagement ſix months after During the peace, which was concluded then, I was almoſt all the time employed at ſea in the ſame ſtation, and made the voyage round the world on board the Etoile (the Star) under the orders of Mr. de Bougainville. During the Miniſtry of Mr. de Boyneis, I was promoted to the rank of Captain de Brulot (Fire-ſhip) in the year 1773; and a month after was appointed Captain of the line of battle-ſhip the Flamand; which preferment rouſed the jealouſy of the officers of ſimilar rank in that ſervice againſt me to ſuch a degree that it never ſubſided ſince. When Mr. de Sartine ſucceeded to that Miniſtry, all the officers who had been moſt inveterate againſt his predeceſſor, ſurrounded him, took the advantage over the others, and forgot nothing to annoy thoſe who had obtained any of the King's favour during the preceeding Miniſtry: in conſequence thereof, the Croſs of St. Louis, which I had the promiſe to be knighted immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately with, was refuſed me after by Mr. de Sartine, and he ordered me to go to Breſt; where, being arrived, I received the commiſſion of Lieutenant of that harbour. Soon after, an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from the King was iſſued, by which the officers of the harbour were no longer to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted in their rank with the other officers in the navy; whereupon I wrote and repreſented to the Miniſter, that I was not in that line of ſervice I had been in hitherto, and wherein I had merited and obtained the King's favour, and begged to be reſtored to it; and to the contrary, I occupied one I was ignorant of, and of courſe uſeleſs in it: he ſent in anſwer my diſcharge to General D'orvilliers, wherein was expreſſed the King's ſatisfaction for the ſervice I had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the ſeveral offices I had occupied; but there was no penſion as uſual, nor the Croſs of St. Louis, was added to it. Mr. de Sartine ſent it thus, thinking I would never leave the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, or accept my diſcharge, without having obtained firſt thoſe things. General D'orvilliers ſaid and did all he could to make me ſtay in the ſervice; but I inſiſted ſo effectually, that after three days, he delivered to me my diſcharge, and I went to Paris.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the year 1777, I imparted a plan to D. Franklin, which he approved of much; but Mr. de Sartine, having been told of it, forbid to put it in execution. I acquainted Dr. Franklin with this diſappointment; he told me he had taken ſome informations about me which were to my advantage, and my ſervices would be agreeable to America; in conſequence thereof, that Mr. Deane was going to fit out two ſhips loaded with very neceſſary ſtores for America, and I could not recommend myſelf better to Congreſs than by carrying one of them, and to ſpeak to Mr. Deane, who was in the next room: accordingly I went, but he informed me that expedition could not take place yet, that he would let me know when it ſhould be time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:018549_0004_0FA7AD65024F9550"/>In April we agreed verbally, Mr. Deane and I, that the ſum of twelve thouſand livres tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois, on my arrival in America, with the ſhip and cargo, would be paid to me as a gratuity; and the commiſſion of Captain of man-of-war in the American navy would be delivered to me with my inſtructions, how to carry on ſaid expedition. But having heard that ſeveral officers ſent in America by Mr. Deane, had not been employed when arrived, I told him I wiſhed to ſee Dr. Franklin (who was removed to Paſſy) give his aſſent to our tranſaction, which he did on the firſt of May, and Dr. Franklin wiſhed me a happy paſſage, and ſaid he expected to hear that on my arrival in America, I had obtained the command of one of the 74 gun ſhips, which would be launched by that time: and Mr. Deane aſſured me he would write by all opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to acquaint Congreſs with our tranſactions, and that I ſhould find every thing in America as I wiſhed.</p>
            <p>The ſame afternoon I ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t off for Marſeilles, where the ſhip was: being arrived there, with the neceſſary ſecrecy and great difficulties, I had her loaded with braſs guns and mortars, bomb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhells, ſhots, powder, brimſtone and muſkets; but was detained there five months by contra orders from Mr. Deane: during which time I was ſent for by Mr. Bertin, the General Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary for the navy, who told me he had received orders from Mr. de Sartine to make a ſecret expedition, and to offer me the command of it; and if I accepted it, I might depend upon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining all the reward I could expect for my former ſervice. I anſwered I was very ſorry I could not accept and accompliſh the Miniſter's order, as I had the command of a ſhip in the harbour confided to my care, which I could not leave: he replied, that he would prevent my ſailing in her, and ordered me to unload her: I told him I had no money to do it; but I would write to Paris for ſome; and accordingly I wrote to Mr. Deane, and at laſt all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were over.</p>
            <p>I ſailed on the 29th September from Marſeilles, with a crew compoſed of all ſorts of men of different nations, having on board as paſſengers, General Stuben, two of his Aids-de-camp, and Mr. de Francy. We went pretty ſlowly and quietly as far as Bermuda: but when the crew perceived the ſhip ſteered northerly, they began one day to grumble from breakfaſt time until after dinner, when a great many of them gathered together on the fore-caſtle, where they were very ſaucy, and ſaid they would not go to North-America; having obſerved there were three ring-leaders among them, and that it was indiſpenſably neceſſary to ſtop the mutiny by open force, ſince they would not yield to reaſon, I ordered the Gunner to have ſome muſkets ready loaded, and to hand me a couple of hangers, of which I gave one to the Firſt-Lieutenant, and told him to follow me on the fore-caſtle, having left General Stuben, with his own ſword in hand, on the quarter-deck, to prevent the mutineers from getting maſters there, I went di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly with my hanger up to the thickeſt of the mutineers, diſperſed the three ring-leaders: ſeeing they were abandoned by the reſt, they got up in the fore-maſt ſhrowds; but ſeeing I had called for loaded muſkets, which were brought to me, they all three ſurrendered themſelves. I had them put in irons, and without any further puniſhment, all were quieted. We met with very heavy and ſqually gales of north-weſt winds, and rough ſeas, for a long time, but at laſt got into Portſmouth River, in Hampſhire, on the 2d December 1777; the place of my deſtination, where I delivered, as per orders, the ſhip and cargo to Mr. de Francy.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as arrived I wrote to, and acquainted, the Honourable Congreſs with the important cargo I had brought in the ſhip, and how I came upon promiſe and expectation of having ſoon a command, being commiſſioned Captain in the American navy, and had alſo the promiſe of being paid, as ſoon as arrived, the ſum of twelve thouſand livres tournois gratuity, for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her there, but received no anſwer to that letter, nor thoſe I wrote after from Boſton, where
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:018549_0005_0FA7AD6588316598"/>
I ſpent the winter, which determined me to go to York-Town. Being arrived there, in the latter end of April, 1778, I applied to the Marine Committee, and exhibitted my commiſſion and correſpondence with Silas Deane, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> which contained his promiſe, that I ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted and well rewarded; but no ſum was ſtipulated, and they ſaid they had received no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence thereof, although he had told me he would ſend; however, having made their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, it was reſolved,

            <p>Having already heard of the undutifulneſs of ſome of the officers in the navy, I requeſted a letter to recommend the Navy-Board at Boſton to appoint ſuch ones as they thought would obey my orders, which was given me, and I tranſmitted to the Hon. James Warren, Eſq, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident thereof, as ſoon as arrived there; but he told me the two Firſt-Lieutenants were already appointed and on board the Frigate Alliance at Salſbury, where ſhe was built. I enquired about them, and was told they were the moſt litigious in the ſervice, and had already participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to have one of the ableſt Captains in the ſervice broke.</p>
            <p>I went to Salſbury and took the command of the Frigate Alliance, but the two Lieutenants received me with viſible reluctance, which was confirmed by their converſation; however, I over-looked it, thinking good uſage would over-come their prepoſſeſſion againſt me: they ſoon
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:018549_0006_0FA7AD6635937440"/>
finding that they could expect no reaſons to alledge againſt my dutifulneſs and activity, began to try to draw me in their ſnares; they feigned to have an irreconcilable quarrel together, and came both to me, one after the other, to tell me they could never, for the future, agree, and requeſted I would diſcharge one of the two: I told them it was forbid me, by the regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the navy; that we would ſoon be in Boſton, where they might make their requeſt on that account, to the Navy-Board there; but if they could not ſtay till then, they might write and ſtate their affair to ſaid Navy-Board, and wait for their anſwer; when they ſaw I had pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated into their ſcheme, they never ſaid a word more about it.</p>
            <p>When we were come down with the Frigate before Newbury town, the firſt Lieutenant came to aſk my leave to go to Boſton; I told him I could not grant it, as there were but two Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants, and the ſhip being in a narrow bed of the river, where ſhe muſt be kept afloat, by ſlaking or heaving every change of tide upon the cables according to the wind, otherwiſe ſhe would be aground: he replied, he did not care whether ſhe went aground, nor for my leave to go to Boſton, he would go, and accordingly went. I wrote the ſame day to the Navy-Board, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting them that the Firſt-Lieutenant had applied to me for leave to go to Boſton, but I had refuſed his requeſt, as the ſhip required his attendance then more than ever; and as he inſiſted upon going there, if they chuſed, he ſhould go to ſend him their leave, without mentioning that he was already gone againſt my will, knowing they muſt know it by ſeeing him there; and it happened, he was in the Navy-Board when they received my letter, by which they could p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ainly ſee the diſobedience of that officer; nevertheleſs, they wrote to me two days after, in an open letter by him, that I could give leave of abſence to the officers whenever I ſhould think proper; by which I ſaw that, inſtead of puniſhing the ſaid Lieutenant for leaving the ſhip and his duty, againſt my conſent, they ſupported him, and gave me a charge which would bring new trouble upon me, as it would diſatisfy the officers, when, by the ſervice, I ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to refuſe them leave of abſence.</p>
            <p>We brought the Frigate Alliance to Boſton in the beginning of Auguſt, where the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants undutifulneſs increaſed daily; they ſeldom remained on board in the night, and rarely any one was on deck in the day time, and did all they could to oppoſe my orders and ſubvert the ſervice. The Firſt-Lieutenant one day came at the head of the ſea-men, amongſt which were a great many Engliſhmen, to requeſt of me, that, inſtead of having their allowance given to them as uſual, in grog, I would order the ſhip's Steward to give it to them in rum: I told him it could not be done, by the danger that, after having drank their rum, they muſt drink water to quench their thirſt, which would make them ſick with cholic, looſeneſs and ſlux; but he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, with the ſea-men, upon it, ſaying it was cold weather then. I cauſed my Clerk to read on the quarter-deck, an article which forbids it, from the Engliſh regulations of the navy, which I was directed to follow; nevertheleſs, when I was abroad, the officers ordered the Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard to give raw rum to the people; and did ſuch things to coax the people, and to alienate them from me. It was given out in town, that I uſed the ſea-men on board very ill, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to prevent others to enliſt.</p>
            <p>The Navy-Board ordered me to prepare and diſpoſe, with all poſſible ſecret, the Frigate to receive the Marquis de la Fayette and his ſuit, conſiſting of nine gentlemen and their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, on board in order to carry them to France: as the bread-room had been made before I took the command, by the direction of the firſt Lieutenant, of double the room requiſite to put the neceſſary bread, I ordered to take three feet and half on each ſide of it to make a gallery round it, as there was all round the ſhips inſide, for in an engagement to have it clear, that the Carpenter might eaſily plug any ſhot holes under water; beſides that advantage, and keeping
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018549_0007_0FA7AD672BE2CD60"/>
the bread drier, it procured room where to put in ſix beds for the paſſengers: and in order to have the bread ſteady in the bread-room, upon the different tacks and motions of the ſhip, preſerved better, and have ſufficient room, I ordered the Firſt-Lieutenant, when I was going on ſhore, to have all the biſcuits ſtowed one by one, by which means it would take only the two-thirds of the ſame room it would by being promiſcuouſly thrown in: but inſtead of having my order ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, he had two men to empty the bags of bread in the bread-room, as faſt as they could. When I came back on board, I found them employed at that work, in his preſence: I told him it was very ſtrange, that though I charg'd him poſitively to have one thing done one way, he always had it done in the contrary: he replied, that it was none of his buſineſs to have the bread ſtowed: I told him it was his buſineſs to tranſmit the orders I gave him when I went on ſhore, that they might be executed: he ſaid he had never heard before of ſtowing the bread, and I might order ſome body elſe to have it done, as he could not order it. He told me that they wanted to have a ſtove in the ward-room: I replied, it was always warm enough there without one; he ſaid no more, but all the three Lieutenants of the ſhip (as there was a third one come) and the Captain and Lieutenant of marines, all together left the ſhip.</p>
            <p>I went to the Navy Board; Mr. Warren was upon his Farm at Plimouth, Mr. Diſchaus at New-London, to fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> out the frigate Confederacy, and there was no body but Mr. Vernon, I told him all the officers undutifulneſs, and how it was impoſſible to have the ſervice done with them, and that they had left the ſhip; he told me I might depend upon having a new ſet of officers before I ſhould ſail, but as there were none in Boſton to receive them on board until they could be replaced, and they returned after four days abſence: the Captain of the Marines told me, he and all the other officers had agreed together, that, if ever I put any one under an arreſt there, every one would go. I acquainted again the Navy-Board with the officers reſolution, which would take out of my power, all manner of corrections and conſequently of amendment. Mr. Vernon repeated his promiſes, ſaying thoſe officers ſhould not go in the ſhip.</p>
            <p>Capt. Barry told me, with an air of confidence, that my officers, with all the Captains, had wrote a petition to the Admiralty or Congreſs (I dont remember which) againſt my command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Alliance, though they had no other reaſon to give againſt me but that I was a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and he added, that he would not ſign it, as Congreſs knew what they were about when they reſolved giving me ſaid command; which laſt part was falſe, as he ſigned it one of the firſt as will appear hereafter.</p>
            <p>The Frigate Alliance being almoſt ready, I wrote to the Marine Committee in Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, where they had removed with Congreſs, that Silas Deane, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> having been there ſome time, they had opportunity, according to their deſire, to enquire of him about our tranſaction between he and I, aſſented to by Dr. Franklin, about the twelve thouſand livres gratuity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be paid on my arrival in America, for bringing the ſhip Flaman, as I had done; and as I doubted not he would confirm my right claim on that account, I begged that Congreſs, who waited only for their report on that ſubject to have me paid, would order ſaid ſum to be paid to me whilſt in France, where I was ordered to go in the Alliance; I received no anſwer.</p>
            <p>The crew of the Alliance being by great many too ſhort, the other men-of-war at Boſton, gave twenty men to increaſe it, and I had beſides thirty ſick Frenchmen left there by Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral Count d' Eſtaing's ſquadron, to enable me to carry the Frigate to France, where I was told I would find American ſeamen enough coming from the Engliſh priſons to complete the crew with.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:018549_0008_0FA7AD6A6E971BD8"/>Before the Frigate Alliance went down to Nantaſket road, I applied to the Navy-Board to have their promiſe of a new ſet of officers fulfilled, as thoſe I had grew worſe every day; but the anſwer was, thoſe I had would be better, when once out of Boſton, and that they had no others; but they wrote a letter to recommend thoſe officers to behave well; the Marquis de la Fayette being on board, who might take notice of any thing that might happen to the contrary.</p>
            <p>The Marquis de la Fayette and the other French gentlemen being on board, and all ready, I went to the Navy-Board to take my ſailing orders from them, but they told me there was a report, that about eighty Engliſh ſea-men from the Sommerſet Engliſh man-of-war loſt upon Cape-Cod, were on board the Frigate Alliance, where they had entered with the plot and proſpect to raiſe againſt the American and Frenchmen on board, in order to get maſters of the Frigate and carry her to New-York; I went with Mr. Vernon to the goal were it ſprung from, to hear more about it, but the man who had gave it out as a certain truth had been releaſed the day before and could be found no where. The Navy-Board nevertheleſs ordered me to ſail and keep good look out to prevent any ſuch things happening. It may be remarked under what ſiniſter auſpices I was to proceed, having no officers that would obey me, and an appearance of ſuch plot on board, having no twenty born Americans in the crew to help me to prevent or oppoſe it. I went on board, and we ſailed on the 14th January 1779, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with the Frigate Deane, which we parted with the 16th inſtant.</p>
            <p>On the 20th inſtant, having had the three days before very various ſtrong winds and high ſeas, by which all the riggings, which was new and frozen, when we ſailed out of Boſton, and had ſtretched to ſuch decree that only the preventers ſtays kept the lower maſts ſtanding up, ſeven of the main and fore-maſts ſhrowds plate having given way, though the top-gallant-maſts and yards was ſtruck down, the main-top maſt went overboard in the night, a heavy ſea came on board, kept the ſhip on her beams end for about a minute, and carried away the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace boat, ſome ſpare maſts and yards from upon the beams, and all the crew abandoned the deck and went to hide themſelves between decks, were one was found ſmothered dead. On the 24th inſtant, having been prevented till then by the bad weather and continual high ſea, we had a another main-top-maſt rigged and hoiſted up, after which we had all fixed as well as poſſible.</p>
            <p>On the firſt February, at 3 o'clock A. M. one of the Maſter's Mate came to acquaint me that he had heard ſomething that night, of a conſpiracy, to take the Frigate from us and carry her to England, by a party of the crew, but that they intended to do it only when we would be upon ſounding ground, as he knew but few of them, and he had heard but looſe words about it, I told him to be watchful and keep himſelf, or another, that could underſtand them in Iriſh, always in the place where from he ſaid he could hear all they ſaid in the Marines birth, where they aſſembled to conſult how to put their plan in execution, and to let me know as ſoon as poſſible whatever he could hear: I told likewiſe the Firſt Lieutenant to watch on his ſide and let no body know it but the Captain of Marines, that he might put no centries by the arm-cheſts and other important poſts, but thoſe he could well depend upon, thoſe officers being very punctual in their duty, and no preſent dangers, I thought unneceſſary to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Marquis de la Fayette with it, which might make him uneaſy, until it became urgent.</p>
            <p>The ſame Maſters Mate came the next night after to tell me further, that he had heard the plotters agree to put their plan in execution the night following at one o'clock, A. M. as there would be none out of bed but thoſe on watch upon deck. As ſoon as it was day-light I went in the ſtate-room which the Marquis de la Fayette occupied, awoke and acquainted him with the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018549_0009_0FA7AD6B51EF81C8"/>
plot going on, and begged he would tell the ſame to the other French gentlemen, and at the ſame time to keep it yet ſecret; and I went to give proper orders to prevent the mutineers to ſucceed in their attempt; I ſent for the Firſt-Lieutenant, told him to go in the ward-room with ſome truſty men, to hand out of the ward-room ſtern ports to the Cabin windows, where I would have ſome body to take in ſome ſpears, muſkets, bayonets, piſtols, hangers and cartridges, which were there; that was done in a moment's time, the bayonets fixed to the muſkets, which were loaded, and the piſtols in ſufficient quantity. I did this, becauſe if we had taken the arms out of the arm-cheſts on the quarter-deck, the mutineers perceiving it, might have ruſhed all together, or pointed the two fore-caſtle nine-pounders, which were ready loaded, and ruſhed upon us before one muſket would have been loaded; beſides, they might have eaſily ſeized up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on two bunches of pikes which were laying in the quarter-deck netting: when we were thus prepared, we could wait for the event calmly, as the Marine officer on the quarter-deck had orders to ſtamp with his feet on the quarter-deck, if he ſaw any extraordinary motion, for a ſignal to twenty who were in the cabin, to come altogether armed upon the quarter-deck.</p>
            <p>When we were ſitting at dinner, the Maſter's Mate came in a hurry to tell me, that the plotters were aſſembled and coming whilſt we would be at dinner. I aſked him whether he knew the ring-leaders; he told me he did. I begged of the Marquis de la Fayette, that he would tell eight of the French gentlemen to arm themſelves with muſkets, &amp;c. and come upon the quarter-deck: the Marquis did, and headed them. I deſired Col. Duplecix to head all the ſervants, ſent for the reſt of the French fore-maſt men, and all to remain in the cabin, and look out of it, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the mutineers from pointing the deck guns on the cabin, and to fire upon them if they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to do it. I went with the Marquis de la Fayette and the eight gentlemen upon the quarter-deck, ſhowed them the two arm-cheſts and two bunches of pikes, which I begged the Marquis de la Fayette to have well guarded, and to ſee that nobody touched the two fore-caſtle guns, and prevent any body from going up in the tops, where there were arms and ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. I told the Firſt-Lieutenant to ſee upon deck, and ſent another between decks to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any party of ſeamen aſſembling together.</p>
            <p>I ſent for the Armourer, told him to bring hand-cuffs and fore-locks in the cabin, and went there, where I found the Maſter's Mate; I aſked him who were the ring-leaders, he told me the Maſter at Arms, who had the charge of the ſmall-arms; the firſt Serjeant of Marines, who had the care of the arm-cheſt; and the firſt Gunner's Mate. I ſent for the firſt of thoſe, had him hand-cuff'd and put in the ſtarboard quarter-gallery, under the guard of a Frenchman; the ſecond was likewiſe ſhut in the larboard quarter-gallery; and the third was, in the ſame way, put in the ſtate-room. As ſoon as thoſe three were well ſecured and parted, I ſent eight of the Frenchmen, under the command of an officer, to relieve the officers upon the quarter-deck, and went to deſire the Marquis de la Fayette, the French gentlemen, the officers of the ſhip and of marines, to aſſemble in the cabin to make a Court of Inquiry.</p>
            <p>The Maſter at Arms was firſt brought in; but he would own nothing: he was put again in the ſame place. The Serjeant of Marines was brought in next; he would own nothing before the Court, but he ſaid to Col. Duplecix, who went with him to have him ſecured in the ward-room, that if the Court would ſave his life, he would diſcloſe all the plot. The Gunner's Mate being brought in, he owned the plot, and ſaid the Maſter at Arms was the headmoſt of the ring-leaders, and had plann'd it in Boſton as he was employed in enliſting the crew; that they were about eighty that agreed together to carry this horrid plot on, as they had determined to ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſact almoſt every one except the Marquis de la Fayette, whoſe life they would have ſaved, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting to have a reward for him of the Engliſh government. He named ſome of the abettors,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:018549_0010_0FA7AD6B6FFCB2D0"/>
which were inſtantly put in irons; he was ſent down the ward-room and ſecured there. The Serjeant was brought in again, and charged likewiſe the Maſter at Arms, and that he was the mover of the plot when at Boſton enliſting the men: that the plan was, to take the ſhip as ſoon as ſailed out of Boſton, and carry her to New-York; but the company of the Frigate Deane, and the bad weather prevented their doing it then: that to put it in execution, they had agreed that one of them would go at the maſt-head and cry out, a Sail, upon which all hands would be ordered to their quarters: that the Gunner's Mate, who had the management of the two fore-caſtle guns, with all the fore-caſtle foremaſt men, which were in the plot, would help him to point on the quarter-deck and fire one thereof on one ſide, and the other on the other, to ſweep off all they could, and all together, armed with crows and hand-ſpikes, to ruſh on the quarter-deck, get maſters of the arm-cheſts and pikes; next deſtroy all the Frenchmen on board, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Marquis de la Fayette: the Captain was to be put in irons in one of the boats, and let looſe at ſea; and ſome of the officers of the ſhip were to be ſkinned alive, &amp;c. We had thirty-eight put in irons, moſt of which owned the plot; but the Maſter at Arms, though char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by all the others, did never own any thing. Having all the moſt guilty in irons, in a cloſe birth between decks, well guarded by Frenchmen, a good guard upon the quarter-deck, and the Marquis de la Fayette, the French gentlemen and their ſervants, as well as all the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the ſhip, keeping guard day and night by hours, we left the Court of Inquiry, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a regular Court-Martial to proceed further with the culprits, and proceeded on our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. I have been particular in relating as conciſely as poſſible this affair, becauſe is was printed differently in the papers at Paris; and becauſe I think the infallible method to bring out a plot in a crew was taken, which will never fail in ſuch caſe: to the contrary, had the three ring-leaders been confined together, it would have been more difficult to bring the truth out of their own mouths.</p>
            <p>On the fourth inſtant we ſaw and came up with two Swediſh veſſels, one a ſhip, the other a ſnow, coming laſt from Mounts-Bay, in England, where they had taken in their cargo: I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the two Maſters thereof to bring their papers on board to be examined; but they brought but part of the neceſſary one; I aſked the officers opinions; they told me they appeared to be Engliſh property, and it was their advice to carry them into France to be examined. I ſent a crew on board each of them, and ordered them to the firſt port they could make; but only the ſhip arrived at Morlais: the ſnow was met with by an Engliſh privateer, which carried her to England. We arrived at Breſt on the 6th February, where the Marquis de la Fayette and the French gentlemen landed the ſame day.</p>
            <p>An hour after the Marquis de la Fayette was gone on ſhore, the officers who I had not a word with during the paſſage, ſeeing that there was no witneſs left to ſee their conduct but myſelf, aſſembled and came all together in the cabin, and told me they were come to deſire me to write to Dr. Franklin to ſend them ſome money: I told them I could not, but that I would ſend ſomebody to him if they would all together write to him, and repreſent their want of money; it would be the beſt way to obtain it, without ſaying a word more about it. They aſked me for their diſcharge; I told them I could not give it. Some ſaid they would not ſtay in the ſhip unleſs I would procure them ſome money, and they went all away grumbling.</p>
            <p>The next day after I ſent Dr. Windſhip, the ſhip's head Surgeon, to Paris to carry to Dr. Franklin the pacquets I had for him; by whom I wrote to him that which had happened during our paſſage; ſent him copy of what we had gathered from the mutineers; acquainted him with the want of papers produced by the two Swediſh Maſters, to prove them neutral property; how the Frigate Alliance had ſuffered, and wanted repair in her rigging, iron work, &amp;c. and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:018549_0011_0FA7AD6C39A8B248"/>
begged of him his orders in general, and in particular concerning the mutineers and repairing the ſhip. I wrote likewiſe to Mr. Shwighauſer, agent at Nantes, and ſent him theſe copies juſt mentioned, and requeſted of him his orders on thoſe topicks.</p>
            <p>Some days after, Monſieur de Grogniard, the chief Engineer for the French navy, came the ſame day he arrived from Paris on board: he told me that if I would write to Mr. de Sartine, and requeſt of him the reward I expected for my former ſervice, he knew, from good authority, I ſhould obtain it: I told him I could not, as I was in another ſervice then. He took the plan of two ſliding gun carriages I had had made for the cabin ſtern guns; admired the ſhip's Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter's work, and went away.</p>
            <p>In Dr. Franklin's anſwer of the 16th inſtant and following, he acquainted me with all the difficulties he met with to have the conſpirators tried, or put on ſhore; of having the Frigate admitted in the port to be repaired, &amp;c. and ordered me to repair the ſhip as ſoon as poſſible, but gave me no means whatever to do it. Mr. de Shwighauſer, on the other hand, gave poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive order to Mr. Cottentin, agent at Breſt, to allow for the Alliance nothing elſe but the daily proviſion for the crew. I could not even obtain old canvas to ſerve the rigging with: though Dr. Franklin knew by all my letters, that I could not proceed to repair the ſhip, every means to do it being refuſed me, wrote to me to fit out the ſhip and to give a rendezvous to fifteen American veſſels, richly laden with neceſſary articles for Congreſs, in order to convoy them home, which I could not do without having obtained means to repair the ſhip: he wanted me to aſk him to go to Port l'Orient, I think, where was Capt. Jones, for he hinted it in one of his letters to me, ſaying, "<hi>You and Mr. Shwighauſer muſt judge whether they are beſt done, (ſpeaking of the ſhrowd's iron plates) at Port l'Orient. I mentioned the latter place only becauſe I know they often fit large Indiamen there.</hi>" In the whole it appears that his Excellency B. Franklin <abbr>Eſq</abbr> never intended that the Alliance ſhould convoy the American veſſels to America, but from the beginning contrived it ſo, as to detain her until thoſe veſſels were ſailed, to join her with Capt. Jones's ſhip, which was fitting out at l'Orient, and that he played as well upon the Honourable John Adams <abbr>Eſq</abbr> as upon others, as may be ſeen by the following certificate and by the ſequel, viz.</p>

Being ready to ſail, the Surgeon, with the advice of the Firſt-Lieutenant, took the ſhip's cutter, with ſeven men in her, and was three days abſent, I not knowing what was become of her; at laſt ſhe came, I took the Engliſh priſoners on board, and ſailed out of Breſt for Nantes on the 11th of April.—When we were, on the 18th inſtant, outſide of the entry of the river of Nantes, the officers told me we were going upon a bank of ſand; that the French coaſting pilot did not know the entry of the river: ſome told me they had been there the year before, that the chanel was to the Weſt of the rock called <hi>Grand Charpentier,</hi> and wanted me to go that way; but I brought to and waited for a pilot-boat of the river for a pilot, who ſaid the other pilot was right, and if I had gone the way the officers would have me gone, the Frigate would ſoon have been loſt. The new pilot told me to have all poſſible ſail ſat; the Maſter being gone up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on deck on pretence to ſee that the cables were clear, I told the Second-Lieutenant, who was on watch, to have all ſail ſat; he put down the ſpeaking-trumpet, laughed at me, and ſaid he would not, as there was a pilot on board, I ordered the two other Lieutenants, one after the other, to have the ſails ſat, but they would not order it; I took the ſpeaking-trumpet, being very nigh the rocks, and we got ſafe, againſt my officers wiſhes, up the river as far as Menden, where we came at anchor before night.</p>
            <p>During our paſſage from Breſt to Nantes, the Surgeon came to tell me that the Firſt-Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant and the Captain of Marines, propagated in the ward-room, before every body, that when we were there, the Captain of the harbour had told them I was a peaſant, and he wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how Congreſs had entruſted me with the command of the Alliance, &amp;c. When we were at Nantes, I made the Surgeon rehearſe the ſame before the Hon. John Adams, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and wrote a letter to Mr. de Thevenard, at l'Orient, who was Captain of the harbour at Breſt when we were there (but had been promoted ſince, and made commander of the harbour of l'Orient, where he has been ever ſince) and told him of the report ſpread on board the Alliance as coming from him, which I did not believe; however, I begged of him, as a favour, to write me an anſwer on that ſubject, which he did, in an open letter, incloſed in another to the Hon. John Adams, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> viz.</p>

            <p>Mr. Thevenard had wrote one alſo on the ſame ſubject to the Hon. John Adams, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> which proved enough that his opinion on my account, did not agree with what the Firſt-Lieutenant and Captain of Marines had reported he ſaid of me: but had it been ſo, it would have proved their undutifulneſs and animoſity in ſpreading a report which might come from an enemy.</p>
            <p>Whilſt in Nantes, Jonathan Williams, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> invited me to a ſplendid dinner at his houſe; after which he took me aſide and told me he had goods to ſend to America: as the Frigate Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was going there, he would be glad if I would let them be ſhipped in her; and added, that it was not with a view to ſpare the freight, for he would pay it to me. I told him it was very generous in him, that in return I would ſhow him my unintereſtedneſs, in telling him to write to Dr. Franklin to ſend me an order to do it; I would obey, with no other proſpect than to oblige him: he ſaid he did not chuſe it. The next day after, his uncle John Williams told me the goods his nephew had deſired me to take in the Alliance, were not his own property, but were a quantity of bolts of canvas belonging to the Firſt-Lieutenant of the Alliance. It ſtruck me, and I ſuſpected at once it was a plan concerted to corrupt me, and after bring me guilty.</p>
            <p>I had twenty of the Americans that came in the cartel-ſhip, which preferred forty livres ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to enliſt on board the Alliance, rather than 120 livres for the Bon-homme Richard; and I would have had every one had not the concerned in fitting out that ſhip had them enliſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before my arrival in Nantes' river.</p>
            <p>His Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> wrote me a letter, dated April 24, 1779, in which he ſaid,
<q>"The American ſhips which I propoſed at firſt you ſhould convoy to America, being all ſailed, and the Alliance's return there ſeemed not neceſſary until ſhe had made a cruize: with theſe views, my orders now are, that you proceed firſt to l'Orient, where you will receive your complement of men and ſuch other things as may be neceſſary for your cruize, and where you will meet the farther orders I am preparing to ſend you."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The American ſhips were ſaid to be at Aix-Iſland yet, waiting for a convoy, but ſailed without any for America, and moſt of them were taken in their paſſage: they were not the only ones diſappointed in their expectation, as the Hon. John-Adams, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> had been ſome time on board the Alliance in hopes to go in her directly to America; but by this change of deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he ſaw that he had been play'd upon (as his Excellency had wrote to me two months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore about his paſſage) and that the detention of the Alliance in Breſt appeared to me to give time to the Bon-homme Richard to be fitted out, and make the American ſhips ſail without the Alliance's convoy.</p>

            <p>Monday, May 10, 1779, the wind being fair, I ſailed from Nantes' river; in the afternoon the coaſting pilot thought expedient, the wind being ſhifted to the Weſt, to play the ſhip wind-ward between Beliſle-Iſland and the adjacent rocks to the Main: he told me to have all hands to work the ſhip, and to command myſelf, as he could not make himſelf be underſtood by the officers, which I did accordingly; but the Maſter being jealous to ſee me take the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and to prevent me thereof, anticipated upon the proper time, by giving the word too ſoon in tacking about, to have main-ſail hawled, by which means the ſhip miſtaking, ſhe was very nigh being loſt upon the rocks: this he repeated ſeveral times; the pilot ſtamped with his foot on the deck, ſaid that man would have the ſhip loſt: being ſenſible of the danger thereof, to avoid it I told the pilot to give up the point, and to bear round about Beliſte-Iſland, which we did.

            <p>The Hon. John Adams, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who had been on board the Alliance, always expecting that he would go to America in her, ſeeing thoſe orders, appeared to be convinced he had been play'd upon all the while by His Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and being exaſperated thereat, exclaimed very highly againſt him for his keeping that Frigate in Europe to fulfil his own views, when ſhe was ſo much wanted in America, and had miſſed rendering ſo important a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in convoying the American ſhips there, by being detained when at Breſt.</p>
            <p>For my part, I had had reaſons from his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> ſufficient to decreaſe, in a great degree, the high opinion I had conceived for him; as when at Breſt I had wrote to him a letter, ſtating how the gratuity of the twelve thouſand livres promiſed to me by Silas Deane, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> aſſented to by him, for carrying the ſhip Flamand to America, had not been paid me there. But that, previous to my ſailing from thence, I had wrote and begged, that Congreſs, being confirmed by Silas Deane, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> how that ſum was really due to me, would or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it to be paid to me whilſt in France, and that I expected he had received, or would ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, order to pay it to me. In his firſt anſwer he denied his being acquainted with that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair; but having wrote to him again particularly about that tranſaction, his Excellency wrote to me a ſecond anſwer, by which he ſaid, "<hi>He doubted not Mr. Deane's communicating it to him,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018549_0015_0FA7AD6F4BE54DA8"/>
and that he might have approved of it</hi>"—But it was his opinion, that whatever agreement <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aid Deane made ought to be honorably complied with, and he made no doubt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Congreſs, when acquainted with the circumſtances, would do what is juſt and proper; by which I thought he remembered it as well as I did, but would not own it, in order to make as much delay as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that payment; and what appears to confirm it is, that Congreſs, after Silas Deane, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> had been long and was ſtill in Philadelphia, and had known my requeſt to have that ſum paid to me whilſt in France, they reſolved the 15th of March, 1779, that ſaid ſum ſhould be paid me there, and that Dr. Franklin ſhould be directed to pay it to me; which he muſt have known before the end of May, 1779, either by letters, or the pamphlets containing Congreſs's reſolves, tranſmitted to him, which he never owned to me, though I ſpoke ſeveral times to him about it, and ſtay'd in France until July, 1780, which may make one ſuſpect that one of his inducements for keeping me there, and doing all he did after againſt me, was to prevent my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to America, by which I would not learn ſaid reſolve, and he might keep that ſum from me.</p>
            <p>His Excellency's letter to me about Mr. Hezekiah Ford, coroborated, in my opinion, with his impolitical and improper dealing, which I have had too many proofs of as will appear.</p>
            <p>As I wanted to convince the Hon. John Adams, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> more fully yet, that what the Firſt-Lieutenant had ſaid againſt my character was a calumny, I deſired him to come before him, where I told him that, beſides his undutifulneſs in all reſpects, it had been reported to me, that he had ſaid things on board againſt me, which muſt be proved true or falſe, as there was a fair opportunity of knowing which of the two, and in conſequence thereof, went with him before the Commander, and aſked the Lieutenant whether he knew the Commander, he ſaid no; and the Commander ſaid he had never ſeen the man. I explained to the Lieutenant that it was that gentleman whoſe name was Mr. Thevenard, who was the Captain of the harbour of Breſt when we were there, which he had ſaid told him things againſt my character.</p>
            <p>I don't know what encouragement Capt. Jones gave to the officers of the Alliance, but he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained them daily, and their undutifulneſs encreaſed inſtantly. The ſhip called the Bon-homme Richard, which he was fitting out, was but a very precarious command, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in her might every moment change her deſtination, or Captain: but the Alliance was a fine and pretty good Frigate, which he could not deſpiſe the command of, and which was worth ſome of his attention; and he had kept a correſpondence, I was told ſince ſhe arrived firſt in France, with the Captain of Marines on board, who he had had made an officer ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the American navy, and which I always ſuſpected, to promote Capt. Jones's intereſt amongſt my officers to my prejudice.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, a Lieutenant in the American navy, who had known Capt. Jones in America, and had been under his orders, gave me a very bad character of him: having learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this, ſeeing my officers undutifulneſs increaſing, and their inventions againſt my character, which might be augmented and ſupported by Capt. Jones, if he thought it neceſſary to come to his end; having not a man on board upon whoſe veracity I could depend; having already proofs of the ways of dealing of his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> the only one I could apply to for redreſs.</p>
            <p>Having well conſidered on my dreadful poſition, I foreſaw that, one day or other, I muſt be ſacrificed, either to the old plan and jealouſy of my officers, which would not ſpare the loſs of the Frigate to ſatiate their animoſity againſt me: to the ambition of Capt. Jones, to have the command of the Frigate Alliance; or to the views and intereſt of his Excellency: and that it was impoſſible for me alone to do any great things for the ſervice, having the undu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulneſs of the firſt always ready, by their diſobedience and oppoſition, to make all my plans
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:018549_0016_0FA7AD71A7AFC270"/>
and orders miſcarry. The ſecond who might give me ambigous orders by which he might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate to himſelf the ſucceſs, and charge me with the misfortunes which might happen: and the third who might refuſe me juſtice. On the other hand, though I had ſpent already a great deal of money ſince I was in the American ſervice, I would have conſented to loſe it, and the ſum due to me to get clear, with honor, of the command of the Alliance: but I could not in a foreign country leave her, after Congreſs had been ſo generous to intruſt her to my care, without proper documents from his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> to juſtify my neceſſary reſignation and retreat from her.</p>
            <p>In conſequence I wrote (the copy has been loſt or took from my papers) as much as I can remember, for the firſt and only time to his Excellency B. Franklin <abbr>Eſq</abbr> about the Alliance's officers undutifulneſs, that a Captain cannot do every thing by himſelf, but muſt have officers willing to, and that ſee his orders executed; otherwiſe ſoon or late he muſt miſcarry: if thoſe who are to obey him do exert their animoſity againſt him, in deſtroying all ſubordination by which a Frigate may be every moment in danger to be loſt, &amp;c. that I had rather ſeen another Captain named commander of the Alliance, than to expoſe her any more, and my honor, with thoſe that ſpared nothing to deſtroy both, in order to hurt me: that I was conſcious of the honor Congreſs had beſtowed on me in giving me the command of the Frigate Alliance; and nothing but her ſafety, and my long ſuffering, and anxiety on board of her, by the miſconduct of the officers, could have induced me to write him this.</p>
            <p>"<hi>His Excellency B. Franklin Eſq'rs anſwer of May</hi> 19<hi>th</hi> 1779, <hi>was that he was exceedingly afflicted of that I had wrote to him about the officers, that at the diſtance he was, he could but leave the matter to Commodore Jones, whoſe authority, with the aid of Court-Martial, if neceſſary, would be ſufficient to compoſe theſe diſſentions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though I was warn'd againſt Capt. Jones's character, by all I heard ſaid of him, either by American and Engliſh gentlemen, and had been told he wanted to ſecure the command of the Alliance to himſelf: I thought neceſſary to have ſome change in my ſituation, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence I applied to him for a Court-Martial, to judge between my officers and me. But either by Captain Jones's councils to the officers, or by the officers conſciouſneſs of guilt, they refuſed, he told me, to ſubmit to that Court, becauſe there were three French Captains who would ſet in it, and they would not be judged by Frenchmen. I told him, that if he could form one, of all Americans, I would ſubmit to it; he gave me no anſwer, and I thought no more about it.</p>
            <p>Better than a week after, being on ſhore on the ſhip's buſineſs, Captain Jones called me in from Jonathan Williams Eſq'rs chamber-windows, I went in, he acquainted me then for the firſt time, that he had ſelected five American gentlemen; of which number was Mr. Williams, and that they were to meet together in half an hour's time, to hear and judge the difference between me, and my officers. I aſked Captain Jones whether he had acquainted the officers thereof, and who were thoſe five gentlemen, and if they approved of his choice, he ſaid yes: I told him, I was ſurpriſed that he had never let me know before that ſuch things was to be done, though he had adviſed and conſulted my officers about it, that I ſaw his plan, however I would ſubmit to it, and go there in half an hour, but I muſt ſee ſome body firſt; and went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way directly to acquaint Mr. le Ray de Chaumont, who was the French and American Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's agent, to whom I related what paſſed; he looked very indiſpoſed againſt this plan, and hinted that if ſuch tricks as taking the Alliance from me took place, I would have the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Bon-homme Richard given to me; I was going out to ſee ſome body elſe when I met Captain Jones in the ſtreet, who told me that that Court ſhould not take place, and aſked me
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:018549_0017_0FA7AD74AC9AB768"/>
if I knew Captain Robiſon of South-Carolina, that he had wrote to him to come from Nantes, and could be in two days arrived, and would ſet in the Court as Preſident. I ſaid I did not care who ſhould ſit as Preſident; but as there were thirty American gentlemen then in l'Orient, I requeſted they would be all invited to come in the Court, and that every one who would might be admitted to ſit as a member of ſaid Court.</p>
            <p>Capt. Jones appointed a day for the Court (ſtyled Court of Honor) to meet on board the Alliance. He ſubmitted the liſt of the members to the officers: I don't know whether they objected againſt any one; but there were but ſeventeen ſitting, among which Capt. Robinſon Preſident; (I was told after) had the promiſe of Capt. Jones to have the command of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance, Mr. Williams, Judge-Advocate, a man devoted to Capt. Jones, and Mr. Amiel, the Firſt-Lieutenant of the Bon-homme Richard, who was another who had very likely ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Capt. Jones, for helping to take the command from me; all the reſt were very impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, I think, being moſtly of Boſton.</p>
            <p>The officers firſt charge againſt me was, that I preferred Mr. Blodget's company to theirs: I ſaid I did, becauſe he behaved always with civility to me, and they never did.</p>
            <p>The Firſt-Lieutenant ſaid I never ordered in the ſtorm we had four days after ſailing from Boſton, to have the guns howled in; I anſwered to the contrary, I ordered ſix tons of pig-iron ballaſt to be took from out the hold and put between decks, becauſe ſhe rolled too hard wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and it would have been worſe had the guns been howſed in.</p>
            <p>The Firſt-Lieutenant ſaid that, whilſt at Breſt, I had never ordered the exerciſe of the great guns to be done: I ſaid they had orders to exerciſe the great guns; and the Captain of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines to exerciſe the Marines when ever the weather and the ſhip's buſineſs permitted; and ſent in the ward-room for their book of orders, and ſhowed to the Court it was the firſt order in it.</p>
            <p>The Captain of Marines ſaid I had never introduced any one of them in French company: I ſaid that I had not, becauſe I thought the company they kept and thoſe I uſed to ſee, were quite different.</p>
            <p>The Second-Lieutenant ſaid I ſlighted my officers, and ſhowing his left-hand, added he had loſt two of his fingers in the American ſervice: I anſwered that I would have never ſlighted my officers had they not forgot they were ſuch; that it was unfortunate to have loſt two fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, but it gave no right to undutifulneſs.</p>
            <p>Then I related their undutifulneſs in the entry of the river of Nantes: they denied the fact, and produced a witneſs, but he declared it was as I had ſaid; by which evidence they appeared too guilty, and the Court ſaid they were not competent judges, as ſuch undutifulneſs required the immediate juriſdiction of a Court-Martial.</p>
            <p>An American gentleman came from Nantes to l'Orient, having heard of the plan going on againſt me, and that Capt. Jones wanted to take the Alliance from me, which he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to Capt. Robinſon, who was prevented to ſit any longer in the Court by him. I gave no other charges againſt the officers, as the Court had ſaid they were not competent judges; and I would have forgot all, if the officers would have promiſed to be dutiful: but Capt. Robinſon being prevented ſitting in the Court, put an end to it. Capt. Jones, being diſappointed, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gave me the judgment of the Court; but I have had it ſince—it is as follows.</p>

            <p>By the above it appears that ſaid Court judged the Lieutenants had no real cauſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint againſt me: but the Court don't ſay that I had not ſufficient reaſon of complaint againſt theſe Lieutenants; and are ſilent on that account, becauſe they were not competent judges of the firſt charge and the only one (being ſtopped by the Court) I charged the Lieutenants of.</p>
            <p>Captain Jones being diſappointed by the above judgment (of which he never ſpoke to me) affected to ſhow me more confidence than ever: he wanted me to make the book of ſignals, but I told him I could not, as I was compelled to go on ſhore for the leaſt thing wanted, having no body in the ſhip who could ſpeak French but myſelf; and the ſervice on board required my preſence all the time I was not buſy on ſhore: however Capt. Cottineau of the Pallas made ſaid book of ſignals and had it printed for him.</p>
            <p>A few days before we were ready to ſail, it was reported to me, that the Firſt-Lieutenant had all the bolts of canvas heretofore mentioned, on board; and that they had been there ever ſince the ſhip's cutter had been away from the ſhip in Breſt three days, and brought them on board, when at Breſt; I ſent for him, and told him I could not ſuffer them to remain in the ſhip, having orders to the contrary, and to make him mind what I ſaid, I told him if I found them in the ſhip, I would have them thrown overboard; and I went on ſhore on purpoſe to give him an opportunity to take them out of the ſhip; which he did, and he with the Second-Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant went away and never returned on board the ſhip again: the reader muſt conſider, by the by, had I granted Jonathan Williams, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> to have thoſe goods on board, or his uncle John Williams that the Firſt-Lieutenant might have them on board, it would have been brought in by the court, againſt me, by which the ſhip would have been taken from me.</p>
            <p>Capt. Jones perceiving that Lieutenant Brown of the Navy and Mr. Amiel the two Firſt-Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants of the Bon-homme Richard, Mr. Dick, the Capt. of Marines, would not ſtoop to be his tools to all intents and purpoſes, found out ſome way or other to diſcharge them, and replaced others whoſe delicacy would never cauſe them to be diſcharged by Capt. Jones. On the 17th of June, 1779, the Bon-homme Richard, Alliance, Pallas, Vengeance, and Cutter Cerf, ſailed out of port l'Orient to Groay-Iſland: and on the 19th inſtant we ſailed from thence all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:018549_0019_0FA7AD75F3BBA318"/>
with a number of veſſels under our convoy, which were going to Rochefort, Bourdeaux, &amp;c. At ſeven o'clock, P. M. all the fleet hove to on the larboard tack (the iſle Dieu bore from S. E. by E. to S. E. by S. of us) under the three top-ſails, ſettled on the caps with the main and mizen-top-ſails back'd. At midnight, going upon the quarter-deck, I met Lieutenant Degge, who was then the Firſt-Lieutenant (the Maſter, named Mr. Buckley, and a Midſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man called Lynd, acted both as Second and Third-Lieutenants) who told me that the Bon-homme Richard and the Pallas were both pretty nigh, one by our weather-bow, the other by the lee, and that we were about the middle of the fleet. As ſoon as I was on the quarter-deck I perceived the windward ſhip, which was about three cable<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s length in the wind's eye of us, bearing away without any ſignal whatever; thinking her to be the Pallas, I hailed her in French, and told her ſhe would come and board us if they did not take care; but by the confuſed voices I heard on board of her, I ſoon knew her to be the Bon-homme Richard; I ordered the helm a-weather, to ſheaver the after ſails, hoiſt up the fore-top-ſail, and run up the gibb; at the ſame inſtant, not conceiving that the Bon-homme Richard would wear ſhip in the night, and in the middle of a fleet, brought to, without making a ſignal therefor firſt, and knowing moſt of her crew was compoſed of Engliſh ſeamen, took out of the priſons, which had already muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the port of l'Orient, and very likely would not miſs a fair opportunity, if they found it, to get maſters of that ſhip: I imagined they had done it, as I heard them cry and ſcream all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as if they had been murdering one another; and thinking they were coming to board us on purpoſe, I aſk'd Capt. Park whether he had the key of the arm-cheſt, he ſaid no; in that very moment when the Alliance began to move a-head, but not enough to anſwer her helm, the Bon-homme Richard boarded her windward on our larboard ſide juſt off the main ſhrowds, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away our mizen-maſt, driver boom; cut our quarter down to the deck; broke the mizen-chain's plate, the quarter-gallery, &amp;c. &amp;c. Seeing all the men upon the fore-caſtle and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprit of the Bon-homme Richard, and being ſtill perſuaded they were going to jump on board, I ſtepped in the cabin and aſked a negro for my piſtols, who told me they were lock'd up in one of my trunks; I went up again and ordered to cut any of the Bon-homme Richard or Alliance's rigging which kept the two ſhips faſt together, which being done we went ahead and got clear. The next morning I had a mizen ſail rigged properly inſtead of a ſnow ſail, and at ten o'clock, A. M. the Alliance was reduced to a ſnow, ſailed and worked thus very well.</p>
            <p>At noon I went on board the Bon-homme Richard, and told Capt. Jones that I had never heard before of a ſhip wearing in the middle of a fleet in the night, without making ſignal therefor; and that I was ſo far from thinking it, that I aſcribed that manoeuvre to a mutiny from the Engliſh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> board his ſhip: he replied, that the Bon-homme Richard had much ſuffered, as all her head and cut-water had been carried away, and her bowſprit was ſprung, &amp;c. thereby.</p>
            <p>The veſſels under our convoy went into Rochefort and Bourdeaux on the 21ſt inſtant, and we kept cruizing going weſtward.</p>
            <p>On the 22d inſtant, at four o'clock, P. M, the Pallas being three miles ahead of the Bon-homme Richard, and in chaſe after a Spaniſh brig, we ſaw three ſails which appeared of force, bearing S. E. by E. of us, which bore at firſt for us, the Bon-homme Richard made a ſignal at her mizen-yard for the Pallas to rally, which ſignal ſhe could not ſee, being right ahead of the Bon-homme Richard; this ſhip made me a ſignal to ſend all my gunners on board of her; I ſaw 'twas a miſtake, and went to ſpeak to the Bon-homme Richard, which told me to ſail ahead and make the ſignal for the Pallas to tack about; I did, and we all took the ſtarboard tack under all ſail; the three ſhips in ſight took the ſame tack, and as I out-ſailed thoſe of our fleet, I went within three miles of thoſe three ſhips and knew them to be French Frigates. In

the duſk of the evening the Bon-homme Richard having made me a ſignal to rally, I bore away and joined her about eight o'clock.</p>
            <p>On the 26th inſt. by want of ſignal made on board the Bon-homme Richard during the night, the Alliance and Pallas loſt ſight of her and kept company together.—On the 28th inſt. fell in with a brig under Engliſh colours, made her come to; ſhe proved to be called the Three Friends belonging to Dublin, bound there from Bordeaux, loaded with wine and brandy, having French and Engliſh papers dated 1778, but none from the American Miniſter in France, for which reaſon I thought it my duty to carry her in to be examined. The Alliance, Pallas and Three Friends arrived on the 2d of July at Groais-Iſland, where we found the Bon-homme Richard and brig Vengeance; but the Cerf was in l'Orient. I went on board the Bon-homme Richard and ſubmitted to Capt. Jones's peruſal the brig Three Friend's papers, and gave him this in writing, viz.</p>

            <p>I had her into l'Orient delivered to Meſſi'rs Gourlade and Moylon, took their and Mr. Le Ray de Chaumont's certificate how I had put her under their care. And I wrote to his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency B. Franklin, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> on my arrival about her.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the Alliance was at l'Orient I ordered her carpenters to make a mizen-maſt, yards, &amp;c. &amp;c. and repair all the damage ſhe had ſuffered on the 19th ultimo, as faſt as poſſible.—On the the 4th inſtant whilſt I was on ſhore, a high S.

labour, ſhe drove and went a ground. I went on board and had her lower yards and top-maſts ſtruck, and the ſhip ſhored up with yards, booms, top-gallant-maſts, &amp;c. When the tide came up again we had her off without any damage to appearance, but as ſhe had been on an unlevel and rocky ground and was very foul, I thought it prudent to have her careened, her bottom cleaned and repair the damages if there was any; and though I was no longer under Capt. Jones's orders by thoſe I had from His Excellency B. Franklin, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> I aſked his advice, which was to have it done. I went in on the 7th inſt. and had her careened accordingly, and went out of the harbour on the 20th.</p>
            <p>Capt. Cottineau of the Pallas, on our arrival at Groais had wrote to Mr. Le Ray de Chaumont, that Capt. Jones was incapable of commanding a fleet what ever, and that the accident which had happened on board the Bon-homme Richard and Alliance, and the ſeparation was owing to want of ſignals being made on board the Bon-homme Richard, &amp;c. &amp;c.

               </gap>d Capt. Jones had been made acquainted with it; and he thirſted for vengeance againſt Mr. Cottineau: One day being on board the Bon-homme Richard <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e flattered me much and paid me great compliment on the expedition I had made in having the Alliance careened in ſo ſhort a time with no other help but her crew; after thinking that he had ſoothed me enough he aſked me what I thought of Capt. Cottineau; I told him I thought well of him: Capt. Jones told me ſomebody had wrote to Paris againſt him, and aſked me whether I thought he had done his duty during the cruize we had made, I anſwered I had not wrote to Paris at all; ſeeing that I did not anſwer his purpoſe he aſked me, on the 22d ultimo when we ſaw three ſails, did we not chaſe them as ſoon as Capt. Cottineau was rallied, I ſaid we had; but ſaid he, did not Capt. Cottineau, before we chaſed, run away under all his ſails ſet, though I made him a ſignal to rally, and would not come until you went and made him the ſame ſignal, and don't you think he ought to be tried for it; I told him I could not call what Capt. Cottineau did then running away, as in the uſual ſailing march he was to be the head moſt ſhip, where he was; ſeeing a Spaniſh brig ahead of him he preſſed ſail after her to know who ſhe was, and of courſe he got more diſtance ahead than uſual, and when we ſaw the thr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and a tool of me, he could hold his anger no longer and gave vent to it ſtamping on the cabin floor, and ſaid that it was Mr. Cottineau had wrote to Mr. Le Ray de Chaumont againſt him, who had ſhown the letter to the French Miniſter, and added that Capt. Cottineau thought he knew more than others, becauſe he had made the book of ſignals, which he could have made himſelf; however he durſt never ſpeak to Capt. Cottineau about it, nor bring him before a Court-Martial for his pretended running away.—After a while he appeared calm and told me he was going to order a Court-Martial to try a party of his crew who had made a plot to get maſters of the ſhip, in order to carry her to the enemies.</p>
            <p>Capt. Jones accordingly appointed a Court-Martial, and we ſat and tried a number of his people; and as I ſat as Preſident, I went to acquaint him ſeveral times that the man or men tried were acquitted; at which he always look'd angry, and ſeveral times ſaid we would acquit them all. The laſt one who was tried when I ſat in the Court was a Jerſeyman, who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed to have ſaid to other Engliſhmen that he wiſhed to meet with an Engliſh 74 man-of-war becauſe the Bon-homme Richard would be taken without fighting, and he ſhould go to his country and ſee his family: the Court agreed that ſuch words were very licentious and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to be ſpread among ſuch a crew, and that the man deſerved to be puniſhed for an example,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:018549_0022_0FA7AD7837D2A640"/>
not with death, but with laſhes; and that all the members ſhould give by ballot (that is by writing the number of laſhes the criminal was to receive upon a billet, and that the ſum ſhould be divided by the number of the members ſitting) the number thereof they thought he deſerved to receive to puniſh him and make an example: accordingly, every one having given me their ticket, Capt. Cottineau, who ſat at my right, helped to open them, found in one of them wrote <hi>hung,</hi> he ſhowed it to me; I aſked who could wrote that after the Court had agreed that the man tried deſerved nothing but laſhes; every one diſowned having wrote the billet where it was wrote <hi>hung.</hi> I told that every one muſt take again their own ticket; we did, ſo the ticket on which was wrote <hi>hung</hi> was left on the table, and one of the members without ticket, which proved him to be the owner thereof (he was one that I have mentioned heretofore, which Capt. Jones had recruited to reimplace the officers he had diſcharged.) Several of the Court exclaimed at him; he being confu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed, ſaid that Capt. Jones wanted the man to be hung, and took his ticket and wrote upon another five hundred laſhes: the Court exclaimed at him again, ſaying they were not aſſembled there to do Capt. Jones's will, but they were to do juſtice, and his billet was not at all received. I went and carried the ſentence paſſed to Capt. Jones, and told him of that officer ſaying that he, Capt. Jones, wanted to have the man hung: Capt. Jones replied, that if he had ſat upon the Court he would have croſs-queſtioned the culprit in ſuch manner that he would have proved more guilty, and made an example of. I told him I had no ſuch art, and would never give my vote againſt a man without I knew, by impartial evidences, that the man tried was guilty, and would judge then, in my own conſcience, of the puniſhment. Capt. Jones told me I could ſit no longer in the Court, as it was to try who was guilty for the Bon-homme Richard and the Alliance boarding one another on the 19th ultimo. Being one of the party, I thought he meant that, having been the ſufferer by being the Captain of the Alliance which had been boarded, I could not ſit for fear of partiality; I ſaid very well.</p>
            <p>The next day following a Court ſat, I was ſent for there and told, that it was reported 'twas the Alliance which had boarded the Bon-homme Richard; in a minute's time I demonſtrated that all the fleet was brought to on the larboard tack, the Bon-homme Richard lying in the wind's eye of the Alliance, conſequently that the Alliance being brought to could not go in the wind's eye to board the Bon-homme Richard there; but on the contrary the Bon-homme Richard wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without ſhowing any ſignal, had boarded the Alliance, tho' I had ordered the helm a-weather, &amp;c. but that the Alliance not anſwering her helm, having no head way, could not avoid it; and though Capt. Jones had very likely a ſtrong party in that Court, they told me that it was enough, and I went about my buſineſs.</p>
            <p>But Capt. Jones not being able to put his fault, in that reſpect, upon me, looked for another victim to lay it upon, in order to clear himſelf before thoſe in Paris who had been told of his i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>bility in that inſtance: his Firſt-Lieutenant, who was called Capt. Robſon, of New-London, (I was told) who was very ſick upon his bed at l'Orient, was pitched upon; and though I never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:018549_0023_0FA7AD78F604B088"/>Capt. Jones fearing that Lieutenant Robſon after being recovered, being an American, would, before the twelve months of ſuſpenſions were expired or after, ſpeak with other officers better acquainted with the rule of ſervice than he was, who would adviſe him how and who to apply for redreſs for the injuſtice he had received, and at ſame time might have ſhowed that all the fault was Capt. Jones's; he, Capt. Jones, imagined to have Lieutenant Robſon broke and rendered incapable of ſerving his country, by which he ſhould be deprived of any intercourſe with the Navy-Officers and would be forgotten as being really guilty: according to his views he ſpoke to me of it and told me the ſentence given by the Court againſt Lieutenant Robſon was inconſiſtent with the fault committed, as if he was faulty, being a middling-age man, after having been ſo long a ſea-faring man, it could be expected growing old he would loſe rather than gain the knowledge of working a ſhip, and never become a good officer, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence he would always be incapable of being a Lieutenant in the ſervice, and of courſe he was going to have a Court appointed to annihilate the former ſentence and have Lieutenant Robſon rendered incapable of ſerving in the American Navy: I told him that I thought alſo the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſentence was inconſiſtent and unjuſt as I thought Lieutenant Robſon guiltleſs, thinking 'twas unavoidable for him to board one ſhip or another in ſuch circumſtances; but ſuppoſing him ever ſo guilty, ſince the Court-Martial had paſſed a ſentence, they could not revoke it and make another, by which the puniſhment would be aggravated, and that no power in America could do it; he ſaid he would have it done.</p>
            <p>Capt. Jones had accordingly the day after a Court appointed, and went in it himſelf, and by his influence there and ſome of his ſpecious reaſons, had the former ſentence broke and a new one paſſed, by which Lieutenant Robſon was broke and rendered incapable to ſerve his country (as was reported to me by the Alliance's officers ſitting there) a deed that none but an arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry power could effect; and Lieutenant Robſon was inhumanly left ſick without being paid his wages, compelled to receive alms, and now perhaps is bewailing his miſery with his family, in ſome corner of America, his undeſerved diſgrace and appearance of diſhonour, though he was innocent.</p>
            <p>The Surgeon of the Alliance imparted to me the news he had from America, viz. that the Captains of the Warren and that of the Queen of France, both United States' men-of-war had ſeverally received orders in Boſton to go together upon a cruize, and to carry the veſſels they could take into one the Southern States' harbour, but that they had brought them in Boſton, wherefore both Captains was ſuſpended, the ſenior one for going there againſt his orders and the minor for following his Commodore againſt his orders, by which I learned that a Captain was not to follow a ſenior officer when he had his own orders given to him to the contrary, and that he was to go abſolutely to the place directed to.</p>
            <p>Purſuant literally to the orders I had had from his Excellency B. Franklin, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> dated April 28, 1779, I had joined Capt. Jones and had been under his orders cruizing, &amp;c. until the 2d July following, when we returned and anchored in France, therefore they were fulfilled.</p>
            <p>Mr. Le Ray de Chaumont who was the French and American Agent, and very likely one of the concerned, for fitting out as well the Alliance as the Bon-homme Richard and others, on his arrival from Paris to l'Orient delivered to me the following order from his Excellency B.

Jones's orders when he received it: and that by thoſe I had received July 28th, I was ordered to ſail. Having ſpoke, as directed by his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> to Mr. Chaumont, I told Capt. Jones I would ſail out as ſoon as the wind would permit; he ſaid he expected to be ready ſoon alſo; but I knew he expected men from Nantes, and no body knew when they could come, or whether they were to come at all.</p>
            <p>Auguſt 8th, the wind being fair, and the harbour pilot on board, I got under ſail in the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance at nine o'clock, A. M. and at one P. M. came at anchor under Iſle of Groais.</p>
            <p>Capt.

            <p>I ſigned the above agreement after having read it and found nothing contrary or derogatory to his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, Eſq'rs orders, or the intereſt of any one officer or foremaſt man of the Alliance; as in the firſt article it was juſt that the ſenior officer ſhould have the command by preference to a junior one; and that any one who was not directed by his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter's orders to remain in ſaid ſquadron, could, if he thought neceſſary, retire. In the ſecond article it was likewiſe juſt to ſerve whilſt in ſaid ſquadron, in conſequence of one ſeniority in the American navy, and under the American flag. In the third it was right to have the prizes ſhared according to the American law, and to ſubmit to the two Miniſters to regulate the ſhare of each ſhip. By the fourth it was indiſpenſable that any one who had private orders from his Miniſter ſhould execute them, having no regard to part the ſquadron, if neceſſary to fulfil them: and Mr. Le Ray de Chaumont, being the real Agent of France and the United States, employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſuch by the French and the United States' Miniſters; and had provided for the expences in fitting out the Alliance as well as other veſſels, and to whoſe orders were to be directed the prizes. That by the fifth article he, Mr. Le Ray de Chaumont, ſhould be deſired to be anſwerable for the ſhares of the ſhip's company, in his own name, for thoſe he directed the prizes to be ſent to, as his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who had made him Agent for the Alliance, muſt be anſwerable for him to Congreſs for the United States' ſhare and the ſhip's company, if he failed, &amp;c. The ſixth article was very proper. The ſeventh very natural: And the eighth article I could have no objection to.</p>
            <p>Being all ready, we ſailed in the Alliance, Saturday, Auguſt 14, 1779, in company with the Bon-homme Richard, Pallas, Monſieur, brig Vengeance, brig Grenville, and cutter Cerf.</p>
            <p>On the 19th inſtant, the Monſieur privateer chaſed and came up with a Dutch ſhip, which in her paſſage from Spain to Holland had been taken by a privateer belonging to Liverpool; the Monſieur's Captain took on board ſome bales of ſilk goods out of her, which Capt. Jones pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have a right to have on board the Bon-homme Richard, which the Captain of the Monſieur did not think proper nor ſafe for him to do, and made him and the prize depart from our company.</p>
            <p>The next morning wind pretty freſh S. E. ſaw and ſignaled five ſails in the wind's eye at a great diſtance, the Bon-homme Richard made a ſignal for the Alliance to chaſe, which we did after the largeſt; at noon being upon contrary tacks and in her wake, about nine miles diſtance, we tacked about, but the wind lulling and ſhifting to the E. N. E. ſhe bore two points wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at ſame diſtance; we being then about four miles diſtance in the wind's eye of the Bon-homme Richard who made ſignal about two o'Clock, P. M. which we could not diſcern, the weather being hazy, and from our poſition, which I ſuppoſed to be for joining the Alliance to the fleet, as the ſea was pretty rough and we could gain none hardly. However, not being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the ſignal, I kept chaſing yet, imagining, from the beginning of the chaſe, that Captain
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:018549_0027_0FA7AD7C0165AE68"/>
Jones would ſend the cutter Cerf, which was the fitteſt veſſel to gain in the wind's eye to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noitre the chaſe, at leaſt that he would order ſaid cutter to get between the Bon-home Richard and the Alliance, to repeat the ſignals, which was not done; at four we gained very little upon the chaſe which was yet above ſeven miles diſtance in the wind's eye; ſhe made a lee lurch, we did the ſame to try to draw her to chaſe us, ſeeing it was impoſſible to come up with her, but ſhe came cloſe to the wind again; the night coming on I bore away to join the fleet, which I did about 9 o'clock, P. M. and told Capt. Jones that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> chaſe had appeared to be as large as a fifty gun ſhip or an Eaſt-India-man, but could not well judge what ſhe was, the weather being very hazy.</p>
            <p>We all kept cloſe to the wind all night, and the next day ſaw the ſame large ſhip, and all together gave chaſe to her, but the ſea being rough ahead, the Bon-homme Richard cut ſailed faſt the Alliance, and was above two miles ahead of us, gaining very faſt upon the chaſe, when a little brig called the May-Flower, from Limerick to London, loaded with beef and butter, ſtruck her colour; the Bon-homme Richard gave up the chaſe after the large ſhip, though he could have continued it, as he could have the brig manned by five men by the Vengeance which was aſtern of her. Capt. Jones kept all the fleet brought to from 5 o'Clock, P. M. until 10, to man the prize and have potatoes, &amp;c. brought from the prize on board his ſhip, at which the Alliance's crew grumbled much, ſaying that they ought to have their ſhare thereof, and hinted it was my fault if they had not, however the prize was ordered to France, where ſhe arrived ſafe.</p>
            <p>On the 23d inſtant, at 1 o'clock, A. M. the Pallas, who had been out of ſight, appeared by our weather beam, the Bon-homme Richard who was half a mile ahead of us, on ſame tack we were, fired ſeveral ſhots at her, tacked about without ſhowing a ſignal for the fleet ſo to do, but after being tacked ſhe hoiſted at her mizen yard three lanthorns therefor, but having her mizen ſheeted off, it prevented our ſeeing the ſignal at all, and the firſt thing we perceived was the Bon-homme Richard within two muſket ſhots, upon contrary tack, coming right againſt us at the rate of ſix knots, and the Alliance as much, by which both ſhips would have ſunk one another had they fully boarded; but I ordered main-ſail haul and let go and haul all at once, which was done in an inſtant, by which all our ſails were upon the maſt, and the Bon-homme Richard's quarter gallery paſſed within two feet of the Alliance's gib-boom; Lieutenant Degge who was upon the Alliance's fore-caſtle was ſo exaſperated at the bad and dangerous manner of the Bon-homme Richard's way working, that he told Capt. Jones he would ſink along ſide of the Bon-homme Richard; this I was told ſince.</p>
            <p>At 8 o'clock, A. M. made the land, which we found to be Cape-Buff, in Ireland.</p>
            <p>On the 24th inſtant, at 11 o'clock, A. M. the Alliance being a mile aſtern of the Bon-hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me Richard we ſaw a ſail bearing N. N. W. we ſhewed ſignal therefor, and ſat all ſails in order to chaſe her, the ſea being very ſmooth; at one o'clock, P. M. we paſſed along ſide of the Bon-homme Richard as if ſhe had been at anchor; ſhe ſhowed a ſignal for us to drop aſtern, we ſhortened ſail and kept only the three top-ſails on the caps, under which we ſailed as faſt as the Bon-homme Richard under all her ſails, and were compelled to make a lee lurch to let her go ahead of us; at half paſt three o'clock, when we might have been along ſide, or very nigh the chaſe, had Capt. Jones let the Alliance continue the chaſe, it grew quite calm; the Bon-homme Richard ſent her boats, with others, after the chaſe, which was yet above five miles diſtance, not knowing what force ſhe might be, and could have took or ſunk all the boats, being out of our power to ſupport them at that diſtances; beſides on that coaſt where fogs are very frequent and ſudden, it was very dangerous to ſend the boats thus; but Capt. Jones having I ſuppoſe,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:018549_0028_0FA7AD7CB37D1B48"/>
heard that my crew had grumbled againſt me, for having not had their ſhares of what had been taken out of the firſt prize, knew by doing the ſame again, it would increaſe their diſcontent, as it really did; however, the chaſe not having a muſket on board, was taken, and proved to be an Engliſh brig loaded with fiſh-oil, from Newfoundland to England. But Capt. Jones paid dear with his men for having prevented my going to take her, as will appear hereafter. At noon the Skillocks beared S. E. ½ E.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon a ſignal was hoiſted on board the Bon-homme Richard for all the Captains to go on board of her, which they did: being there, it was reported that there was a London privateer diſarmed up in Limerick river, but there was always an exciſe armed ſloop, beſides there was an Engliſh 50 gun ſhip lying at anchor in Gallway bay, between the iſland and the main, where there was one good and ſafe paſſage to go to. It was moved which of the two was beſt to go after; I anſwered, that as to go in Limerick river with the Alliance, or ſend there her boats, it was too dangerous, and inconſiſtent with the orders I had, conſequently I would have no hands in it. As to the 50 gun ſhip, being on my way to go where I was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as we were all together more than a match for her, beſides the probability of ſurpriſing her, or engage her, whilſt ſhe laid at anchor, which would have given us great advantage over her, I was willing to join in the undertaking of ſuch atchievement, as it would deviate but little from the courſe I was to keep to go on my ſtation. I ſuppoſe it was propoſed only in order to have my refuſal, that Capt. Jones might make a charge againſt me, ſaying that by my unwillingneſs he miſſed taking a 50 gun ſhip, and there was no more ſaid about it.</p>
            <p>I obſerved to Capt. Jones that he had expoſed his boats in going after a veſſel which I might have reached before the calm came on, had he not prevented me by a ſignal to do it; he deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſuch ſignal had been made, but it was proved it had; and I added that, not being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his orders by thoſe I had from his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> I joined with him for the good of the ſervice, as he told me he was going alſo in the North Sea, &amp;c. but if he made me again any ſuch ſignal as he had done in the morning, againſt the ſaid good and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the ſervice, I would do what I ſhould think my duty therefor, without taking notice of the ſignals which he might make againſt the good of ſaid ſervice. As I was going on board the Alliance, Capt. Jones followed me in the ſteerage, ſtopped me there, and pointing with his finger at the Alliance, told me, you ſee that Frigate, you may thank me for having the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of her ſtill, for I was empowered by Dr. Franklin to take her from you. I ſuppoſe, finding that I was ſtrict to the orders I had from his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and he could not keep me with him to prevent me from executing them, he told me that, in order to lay me under an obligation, thinking, if I believed him, out of gratitude I would do that which he wanted, which was to keep me from doing my miſſion; but inſtead of that, I told him I knew better, and that I did not believe him, as I was adviſed in time that he had done all he could to take ſaid command from me; and moreover, I told him that I believed no more that Dr. Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin had empowered him to take ſaid command from me, as he had not that power himſelf, I left him and went on board the Alliance.</p>
            <p>At ten o'clock, P. M. the Bon-homme Richard fired ſeveral guns without ſhowing any ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: at eight o'clock, A. M. we ſaw the Cerf making all ſail towards the land: at ten o'clock the Bon-homme Richard came and ſpoke to me; ſomebody ſpeaking for Capt. Jones, told me that the evening before, one of their boats with ſeven men in her, had run away towards the land, that they had fitted and ſent another with ſeventeen men after her, which was not come back; I anſwered I was ſorry for it: he aſked me to go on board the Bon-homme Richard; I told him the weather was too foggy to leave my ſhip <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:018549_0029_0FA7AD7D85E450E8"/>In the afternoon of the 25th (aſtronomick date) I went on board the Bon-homme Richard and aſked Capt. Jones what he wanted of me, gueſſing he would try to make me ſay the loſs he had made was not by his fault, he told me he had loſt two boats and twenty-four men; I repeated I was very ſorry for it, and obſerved, if he had let me chaſe the preceeding day it would not have happened; he replied he did not let me chaſe for fear I would have run too nigh the ſhore; I proved it could not be the Skillocks which he mentioned bore Eaſterly of us, and the chaſe bore N. W. at nine or ten miles diſtance, having her head at the S. W. In chaſing I would have got further and farther from any part whatever of the land, of which we were already at nine or ten miles diſtance: he told me that I wanted to charge him of the loſs of his boats and men, but that they had not run away coming from taken the brig as I really thought; and Lieut. Col. Wirbert, who was there, explained to me that the boats being come back from the prize, and the Bon-homme Richard being in calm, and too nigh the ſhore, the boats were ſent ahead to tow her off; but as ſoon as it was dark, one of the boats cut off her tow-line and ran off towards the land, whereupon the other boat was fitted ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d ſent after her: I ſaid if I had not been prevented from chaſing, the boats of the Bon-homme Richard would have been kept on board, and during the day they might have towed off the Bon-homme Richard, as I had the Alliance towed by her boats, when they would not have offered to run away; but to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the Bon-homme Richard's boats being on board the prize, could not do the ſame ſervice to their ſhip in the day time as they would have done, and they took the opportunity of night, knowing that in five minutes time they would be out of ſight, as they did; therefore it was the conſequence of having prevented me from chaſing the prize which occaſioned the loſs of his men and boats: Capt. Jones, having no reaſon to give againſt what I ſaid, told me 'tis a lie; as he ſpoke very low, I told him I hoped I had not well underſtood what he had ſaid, and to repeat it; which he did a ſecond time and repeated a third, ſaying 'twas a d—m lie: I could help my anger no longer, I got up from my ſeat and told him had he not been on board his own ſhip I would have puniſhed him as he deſerved for giving me the lie the firſt time, and I offered to go away; but he took the key of the cabin door which laid upon the ſtarboard cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, and was going to lock the door: I ſnatched the key from his hand as he was putting it into the key-hole; he tried to take it again out of my hand, but I puſhed him off in ſuch a manner as to intimate to him to go no further; finding he had been too far, and that way would not anſwer, he became as mild as a lamb, tried to exculpate himſelf, ſaying that, in lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the door, he pretended only to prevent any body to come in. I told him he had a centry out ſide of the door, whom he could have ordered to let no body come in: I told him before Colonel Chamillard and Wirbert, the only two there, that I would have ſatisfaction of him, for his abuſive language and demeanours to me as ſoon as arrived; he ſaid he would give it to me as ſoon as we might be on ſhore, any way I pleaſed; and I went away telling him, I would not come for the future on board his ſhip; he made no more oppoſition to my going on board the Alliance.</p>
            <p>The Bon-homme Richard kept firing guns, to call back his two boats and the cutter Cerf, which he had ſent after the elopement to look out for them, but none ever appeared. On the 26th he came to ſpeak to the Alliance, and told that none their boats nor the Cerf were come back. I had ſomebody to anſwer, nor never would I ſuppoſe, on the contrary, that the deſerters were on ſhore, where they would give the alarm and tell our force, by which they might gather together a ſtronger one to come againſt us; and that it was neither prudent nor ſafe to remain there any longer: moreover, that if they intended to remain there, to let me know it that I might proceed where I had orders to go<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they ſaid they would ſtay a day longer only.</p>

M. the wind being Southerly, very freſh, the Bon-homme Richard, Pallas and Vengeance, bore away to the N. W. and we followed: I recommended the officers to keep in ſight aſtern of the Bon-homme Richard; at midnight Mr. Buckley came to tell me they had loſt ſight of every one; I told him to keep the ſame courſe till day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, when, not ſeeing any one, I made the beſt of my way towards Fair-Iſland.</p>
            <p>On the 29th, at ½ paſt midnight, we gave chaſe to a ſhip which appeared to be large; at three o'clock, A.

            <p>On the 31ſt inſtant, at three o'clock, A. M. ſaw two ſails at a great diſtance ahead of us, gave them chaſe under all ſail; they made all ſails to run away from the Alliance, her prize being 6 miles aſtern of her, but the ſea being very ſmooth, in five hours of chaſe we came within five miles of them, when I perceived them to be the Bon-homme Richard and the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance; the Alliance ſhowed her a ſignal and tacked about after a ſhip which was windward, and the Bon-homme Richard and Vengeance did the ſame; the chaſe bearing before the wind, the Alliance went to lay athwart her hawſe, and made her ſtrike; whilſt the Bon-homme Richard got three miles windward, but came down after to her: I ordered the prize to bring to, and we hoiſted out our boats to man her; ſhe proved to be the Union Letter-of-marque ſhip, from London, bound to Quebec, loaded with cordage, canvas, ſlops, ready-made cloaths, &amp;c. She had two-and-twenty nine pounders upon her main deck, and fifty-five men on board: the wind and ſea riſing much, Mr. Buckley, whom I ſent on board with thirty of the Alliance's men, had the boats hoiſted upon the prize's tackles, he had ſent me word the priſoners on board were
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:018549_0031_0FA7AD81D26FE110"/>
all intoxicated with liquor, and ſome ſaid they threatened to mutiny. About three o'clock, P.M. another ſail appeared, at a great diſtance, in the wind's eye; the Bon-homme Richard ſhowed a ſignal for the Alliance to chaſe, which could not be adviſable to do, becauſe ſhe had a great many priſoners on board, and but few men left that could be depended upon to guard them, as ſhe had thirty of hers on board the Union; that ſhe had her two boats on board ſaid prize beſides, the wind and ſea were very high, and the Alliance very crank and dull ſailing ſhip in ſuch a ſea: on the other hand, the Bon-homme Richard had none of thoſe motives to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent her from chaſing, and was a better ſhip in ſuch weather, was full manned and had nothing elſe to do; beſides, the brig Vengeance, a faſt-ſailing veſſel, was already three miles windward, which Capt. Jones might have with more propriety, gave ſignal to chaſe, but he would not, and the veſſel got out of ſight.</p>
            <p>All the night the wind blew very freſh, and all ſhips laid to under main-ſail: the next morning the Bon-homme Richard being three miles diſtance by the Alliance's weather bow, made her a ſignal to go and ſpeak to her, which was impoſſible, having then enough of our main-ſail, but the Bon-homme Richard could have clewed her own to let the Alliance come up with her, or could have ſent the Vengeance to tell her what ſhe wanted: as ſoon as the wind lulled, I made ſail and ſpoke to her; Capt. Jones told me to go and tell the prizes to make more ſail, which I accordingly did, though it would have been more proper if he had ordered the ſame to the Vengeance, which was a fitter veſſel for that purpoſe, and had nothing elſe to do; but Capt. Jones did it out of ſpight, to try to put an end to my patience.</p>
            <p>On the 2d September, the wind and ſea falling, I ſent Mr. White, one of the Alliance's Midſhipmen, on board, as maſter of the prize Union, with ſimilar orders I had given to Mr. Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerald for the Betſey, but I told him if Capt. Jones ſent him any, to receive them; we took all the priſoners on board, and manned her properly.</p>
            <p>On the 3d inſtant, at four o'clock, A. M. ſaw from the Alliance, a ſail bearing N. E. ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſignal therefor to the Bon-homme Richard, who did not anſwer it; I ordered to chaſe the ſail in ſight; the Bon-homme Richard ſhowed a ſignal to form the line, but did not ſhow by a ſignal what line to form; and as I was upon a line with her, I continued the chaſe, and ſoon knew the ſhip chaſed to be the Pallas, which had been parted from the Bon-homme Richard ever ſince the 27th ultimo, when we parted her alſo. I went on board the Pallas, and aſked Capt. Cottineau if he could receive ſome of the hundred and forty priſoners that were on board the Alliance, where there was no room to ſecure them properly: he told me I might ſend him ſome; accordingly I ſent him the Union's crew, and kept the others.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon, the Bon-homme Richard ſhowed a ſignal for all Captains to go on board of her; I ſent Mr. Blodget, and deſired him to aſk Capt. Jones's order to me in writing, as I could not go to receive them myſelf. Capt. Cottineau came himſelf to require me to go on board the Bon-homme Richard, and told me 'twas to agree together how to land at Shetland, where Capt. Jones was going; I told him as to go on board the Bon-homme Richard I would never go; that I was not under Capt. Jones's orders was evident, his miſſion being to land as he intended to do, and mine was to cruize by his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, Eſq'rs orders to me; nevertheleſs, if he wanted to conſult me upon any plan, he might do it in writing, or ſend an officer to communicate it to me verbally, and I would give my opinion thereupon; moreover, though I was not under Capt. Jones's orders, if he would ſend them to me in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, I would do all I could to execute them—he went away. Capt. Jones ſent me by Mr. Meaze, the following, viz.</p>

            <p>On the ſeventh inſtant a high N. W. wind drove every one of us from the land, laid to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-main ſail only; at ten P. M. the Richard windward of the Alliance and the Pallas leeward of her, we loſt ſight of every one, ſhowed ſeveral times a light to the mizen-pick, but none an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; at day light none in ſight of us—the wind and ſea very high, found the Alliance's cut-water had parted from her ſtem of above an inch; kept the ſame tack. On the ninth inſt. we had ſounding by fifty-three fathoms: and on the eleventh inſtant made land north of Scarborough.</p>
            <p>On the twelfth inſtant at ſix o'clock A. M. ſaw a ſhip-of-war and a cutter by our weather-bow, they bore down upon us for a ſhort time, and the Alliance kept always cloſe to the wind, but they came cloſe to the wind alſo; the Alliance chaſed them until night, but could not come up with them. The next day we took a brig, loaded with coal, bound from New-Caſtle to Hamborough; I took her crew on board, manned and ſent her to Bergen, in Norway.</p>
            <p>The Alliance having cruized ever ſince, off Flamborough-head; on the 22d inſtant, ſhe ſaw, at the break of day, a large ſhip and a brig; ſhe gave chaſe to them, and they run away, but ſhe came up with them very faſt, when I knew the ſhip to be the Pallas: I ſhowed her the Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance's private ſignal, and ſhe ſhewed me hers; the Alliance ſhowed her a ſignal to chaſe a brig in ſight, which ſhe went after, took and ſcuttled, as well as the other ſhe had with her, when perceived; and the Alliance chaſed another, which got into Burlington harbour, before ſhe could come up with it; being in ſhoal water, ſhe ſtood off: at ſix o'clock, P. M. ſpoke to the Pallas, who told me they had parted the Bon-homme Richard and Pallas three days before, that they had done nothing but took a ſmall brig, which the Bon-homme Richard had ranſomed, and that the Vengeance had parted them the ſame night the Alliance did, but had joined them again two days after.</p>
            <p>At 7 o'clock, P. M. on the 22d September (aſtronomic reckoning) ſaw two ſails, but ſo cloſe to the land, that we could not give them chaſe; at three o'clock, A. M. ſaw two ſails windward of us, one of them appeared to be a large ſhip, which had lights fore and aft, and fired two guns; we brought to, waiting for them, and prepared for action, but they brought to alſo, and ſtood upon the defenſive; Capt. Cottineau, of the Pallas, aſked me, if the largeſt proved to be a ſixty-four Engliſh ſhip, what I intended to do; I anſwered, we muſt in that caſe, try to eſcape, and even if ſhe was above fifty, being too ſhortly manned, I would have nothing to do with her: at day-light, we ſaw they were the Bon-homme Richard and Vengeance.</p>
            <p>About 8 o'clock, A. M. we ſaw ſeveral ſmall veſſels, cloſe to Flamborough-head, which we were chaſing all together, when at ten o'clock, we ſaw windward, one of the brigs, prize to the Pallas, ſcuttled and abandoned the day before, which could be eaſily perceived, as ſhe had all her ſheets and braces looſe, that veſſel offing and loffing ſucceſſively; the Bon-homme Richard chaſed her, and ſhowed a ſignal to all the others to follow; about half an hour, P. M. the Bon-homme Richard fitted out a pilot ſchooner ſhe had taken, to go and take her; but Capt. Jones, in all appearance, forgot to give the officer he ſent in her, a ſignal to recall her on board the Bon-homme Richard, if he thought proper.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:018549_0035_0FA7AD846AC6CE40"/>At one o'clock, P. M. ſaw from the Alliance, two ſails, bearing N. E. of her, about ten miles diſtance, which were upon the ſtarboard tack; the wind being then due weſt, ſhe made ſignal thereof; at half paſt one, the Bon-homme Richard ſhowed a ſignal to the Pallas and Alliance, to chaſe before the wind, theſe two ſails; but the Bon-homme Richard and Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, inſtead of doing the ſame, both tacked about, and kept cloſe to the wind, giving chaſe to the pilot ſchooner, which Capt. Jones had ſent after the brig abandoned. The Alliance and Pallas bore away, ſat all ſails, and ſteered at firſt N. E. by N. to cut off from the land the two ſails chaſed; in chaſing and going from the land, we ſoon diſcovered the fleet of Engliſh merchantmen cloſe to the land, Northerly of Flamborough-head, which had been hidden 'till then from us by ſaid Cape: at four o'clock the wind ſhifted to the S. W. one of the two ſails chaſed tacked about and went cloſe to the wind, upon the larboard tack, towards the fleet; the other, which was the largeſt, kept upon the ſtarboard tack; the Bon-homme Richard and Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, which had been cloſe to the wind, or brought to upon the larboard tack 'till then, began to bear away, being five miles aſtern of the Alliance, and conſequently ſo much farther from the veſſels chaſed; at five o'clock, the largeſt of the two veſſels, ſeeing the Alliance draw nigh very faſt, ſhowed a ſignal to the other, and fired a gun; they both tacked about to join one another the ſooner; the Pallas two miles aſtern, ſhortened ſail to wait for the Bon-homme Richard; at ſix o'clock, the two ſails chaſed, had formed a line upon the ſtarboard tack, cloſe to the wind, at half a cable length diſtance, brought to under top-ſails, the fore one full, the main and mizen ones on the maſt, the largeſt ahead; the Alliance being then a mile diſtance from them, ſeeing the lower battery ports open of the largeſt, and both having St. George's flag and pendent flying, the Alliance brought to upon their ſtarboard quarter, being not half manned, and ſo inferior in ſtrength to the enemies, waiting for the others to agree with them how to attack, having no ſignal during all the chaſe; at ſeven o'clock the two Engliſh men-of-war having wore and put in a line cloſe to the wind upon the larboard tack as they were before upon the other, the Bon-homme Richard coming down at a mile diſtance windward of the Alliance, I had her three top-ſails filled and went cloſe to the wind to ſpeak to Captain Jones, acquaint him of the enemies force, and agree together how to attack them; I had him hailed, but inſtead of anſwering, the Bon-homme Richard, which was right before the wind, went large upon the larboard tack, to avoid ſpeaking to us; ſeeing which, the Alliance bore away and went on the weather-quarter of the enemies as they were, having the largeſt of them at two muſket's ſhot diſtance by the lee-bow, and the other at the ſame diſtance by her beam's end, which hailed the Alliance, but was not anſwered: the Bon-homme Richard went and brought to, about a mile diſtance, by the largeſt of the enemies bow, where ſhe ſtay'd above half an hour: the Bon-homme Richard bore head-long upon the largeſt of the enemies broad-ſide, who taking the advantage thereof, raked the Bon-homme Richard ſore and aft, from her ſtarboard bow to her larboard quarter, by which he was ſo diſabled that the men, after having fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her upper and lower deck guns, left their quarters, as did thoſe upon her poop. At the inſtant the firſt gun of the Bon-homme Richard was fired, the Alliance began the engagement with the other enemies ſhip, which returned broad-ſide for broad-ſide, during twenty minutes; but finding the Alliance's fire too heavy for her, filled her topſails, and had main and fore-tack on board to go ahead, before ſhe was perceived, in the ſmoke to give way: as ſoon as perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Alliance had her topſails filled, and both main and foretacks on board, to join the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's again. The Pallas being on the Alliance's quarter, coming down under topſails, I hail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and told her to make more ſail and come to engage the ſmalleſt of the two enemies, and I would go to help the Bon-homme Richard, who had been ſo diſtreſſed by the enemies broad-ſides
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:018549_0036_0FA7AD870DB05D30"/>
that ſhe fired now and then, ſome of her quarter deck-guns: Capt. Cottineau deſired me to fire a broad-ſide paſſing windward of the ſhip the Pallas was going to engage, which we did; being ſoon come up with the Bon-homme Richard, and the enemy ſhe was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged with, we found them faſt along ſide, head and ſtern of one another, the enemy being windward, and having her head towards the north, fired ſix or ſeven of her larboard lower bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery guns at the Alliance, but the ſhots went between her maſts; ſeeing the poſition of theſe two ſhips, I judged, that if I went along ſide of the enemy, that all my cannon and ſmall-arm ſhots would go on board the Bon-homme Richard, and hers come on board the Alliance, by which we muſt have deſtroyed one another, and the enemy would have the advantage to play her two ſide batteries upon us; therefore I thought the beſt and only way to reduce the enemy was to rake her from ſtern to head; accordingly the Alliance bore away, I called the Lieutenants and Maſter-Gunners, ſhowed them the enemy, which had her ſtern towards us, and recommended them to tell the Gunners, to point upon a light ſhe had in her cabin, and told them to take care not to fire upon the Bon-homme Richard, who had her head towards us; we croſſed aſtern of the enemy, within a muſket ſhot, and all the guns were fired at her one by one, as we went along; at ſame time, our tops fired at her, and upon her quarter-deck; ſhe returned only a few muſket ſhots at us (one of which went through a man's hat brim, who was upon the forecaſtle, without hurting him: I mention this only to prove the impoſition of Capt. Jones, in his relation about the diſtance) the Alliance's broadſide had made ſuch havock on board the enemy's ſhip, that though before ſhe fired twenty cannon to the Bon-homme Richard's one, ſhe was reduced to the ſame level, they both fired but now and then: the Alliance being then right before the wind, and in the impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of coming again in any poſition to fire upon the enemy's ſhip, without running two tacks; having the Pallas and Engliſh ſmalleſt Frigate engaged together, our ſtarboard bow at two cables length diſtance, I thought the beſt ſervice I could do, for fear that ſaid Engliſh Frigate, by ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident or other, might conquer the Pallas, by which the enemies would have been three ſhips againſt two of us; but if I could, by a broadſide, make this Engliſh Frigate ſtrike, we ſhould be four againſt one, by which we would be ſure of the victory, which manoeuvre could not keep the Alliance above a quarter of an hour from helping the Bon-homme Richard; accordingly, the Alliance went in order to rake the Engliſh Frigate, but ſhe ſeeing the danger thereof, had ſhe ſtood ten minutes longer, ſtruck her colours; ſeeing which, the Alliance went cloſe to the wind, with main and fore tack on board, on the larboard tack, the current going to the S. E. as ſoon as ſhe was by the Engliſh largeſt Frigate's weather bow, ſhe tacked about, bore away, and raked the Engliſh Frigate, croſſing ahead of her, from head to ſtern: the Alliance came cloſe to the wild, on the ſtarboard tack, with main and fore tack on board; being wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward enough, ſhe tacked about, and went and raked again the Engliſh Frigate from ſtern to head, bearing down and croſſing her ſtern ſo effectually, that they cried out from the Engliſh Frigate they were ſurrendered, and they ſtruck their colours; the ſame inſtant their main-maſt went by the board: The people on board the Alliance, were ſo cool during all the time, that though there was too cannon left ready loaded and pointed, after having fired the reſt, as ſoon as I gave orders to fire no more, not a ſingle ſhot was fired; and though there was but ſmall wind in the night, and in the ſmoke, the Alliance did not miſs one evolution during all the engagement: the two Engliſh Frigates taken, proved to be the Serapis, commanded by Capt. Pierſon, mounting forty-two guns, having two hundred and eighty men on board, and the Counteſs of Scarborough, Capt. Piercy, a twenty gun ſhip.</p>

            <p>We took a hundred and fifty priſoners out of her; I ſent Mr. Buckley, Mr. Lynd, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters, and forty men on board of her; ſhe had received only five ſhots in her ſide from the Bon-homme Richard; the greateſt damage of the former done by the latter, was in the ſtump of the main-maſt, the ſpars nigh it on the booms; but all her ſtern cabin windows were ſhot to pieces by the Alliance's ſhots, as well as her maſts and yards; ſhe had many ſhots fore and aft, and there was not two foot ſquare in her fore-ſail but had a hole in it, beſides ſhe had a ſhot at her water line, two feet forward of the ſtanding poſt, on the larboard ſide.</p>
            <p>The Alliance took in tow the Serapis, and drew her from the land; very foggy weather, and very weak ſouth wind; at nine o'clock, A. M. we came up with the Bon-homme Richard, Pallas, Vengeance and Counteſs of Scarborough; the former made a ſignal to ſend her our boats and men; I ſent her forty men and two boats, keeping only the barge, which could not go before being repaired, having been ſhot through; and there was but ſeventy men of the Alliance's crew left on board, there being two hundred and twenty-five priſoners. At ten o'clock, the Bon-homme Richard coming right upon the Alliance, ſhe was compelled to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent being boarded, to let go the hawſer ſhe towed the Serapis by. Then Capt. Jones left the Bon-homme Richard, and went on board the Serapis.</p>
            <p>On the 24th inſtant, at ſix o'clock, A. M. I heard with pain, that Capt. Jones, who had left the Bon-homme Richard the day before, and was gone on board the Serapis, ſent me word, to take out of her the wounded people, the only ones left there, and to abandon her; when I knew ſhe could have been ſaved had he been willing, as the ſea had been very ſmooth the day before, during which ſhe might have been heeled from one ſide to the other, and the ſhot holes at her water line, mended by thirty Carpenters and Calkers, with the neceſſary ſtuffs we had on board the ſeveral ſhips; and even at eleven o'clock, when we abandoned her, though theſe holes were only pluged up, and ſhe had not been pumped ſince ſeven o'clock the preceeding evening, and had her lower battery ports open in a high ſea to let in the water, ſhe was not ſix inches deeper in the water than when ſhe came out of port l'Orient.</p>
            <p>But Capt. Jones being ſenſible that his faults during the engagement, were too deeply printed by the enemies ſhot upon his ſhip's ſides and head to be erazed, and beſides that, ſhe being a great deal larger and ſtronger ſhip than the Serapis, inſtead of falſe glory he aimed at by his miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented relation, he muſt have been blamed by every body, who might have ſeen and compared the difference of ſize and ſtrength of theſe two ſhips, and how little the Serapis had ſuffered from the Bon-homme Richard; how much the latter had ſuffered from the former, owing to
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:018549_0045_0FA7AD933456B650"/>
the difference of ability in the two Captains of them, had the Bon-homme Richard been brought into harbour; moreover, by the direction of the ſhot holes he had received, it might have been judged who ſhe had received them from, all which would have been proofs of the falſhood of the pompous relation he gave of his boaſted glory and ability.</p>
            <p>At nine o'clock, A. M. the Serapis, Counteſs of Scarborough, Pallas and Vengeance made ſail and left the Alliance, taking out of the Bon-homme Richard twenty wounded men left there: but at eleven o'clock, theſe ſhips being about ſix miles, Captain Jones imagining and fearing I ſuppoſe that the Alliance would undertake to ſave the Bon-homme Richard (which was impoſſible, as ſhe had only a hundred and fifteen men in all her crew on board) ſent the ſchooner on board of her, to cut all the main-maſt ſhrowd's lanyard, by which it went overboard, and unplug'd the ſhot holes to make her ſink, and ſhe accordingly ſunk at noon.</p>

            <p>Captain Jones, to make the better ſhow and gain credit, in coming into the Texel, had kept the old ſails of the Serapis bent, which had been ſhot to pieces, and in danger of loſing that ſhip, which perhaps he would have liked very well, in order to ſay that ſhe had been ſo diſabled by the Bon-homme Richard that he could not bring her in, though there could be not one of her ſhots in thoſe ſails, by the way ſhe engaged her.</p>
            <p>On the 4th inſtant, as the Alliance was ſailing into the Texel, Mr. Dumas, the American Agent in Holland, came on board; as ſoon as he knew me to be the Captain, he entreated me to have no quarrel whatever, whilſt in Holland, and ſhowed me a letter to him, from his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency Benjamin Franklin, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> on that ſubject. How could his Excellency foreſee that Captain Jones and myſelf were at variance, if he knew not that Capt. Jones would, by his conſent, wrangle with me? I gave him a letter to forward to his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> relating to him the eſſential parts of our cruize. The other ſhips got into the Texel but the next day after, all under French colours.</p>
            <p>Mr. Dumas had given me the direction of Mr. Neuville, Merchant, at Amſterdam, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to him for the Alliance's wants, to whom I wrote.</p>

Jones was in the houſe, I told Mr. de Neuville I wanted to ſpeak to him, he told me he was at the Hague; he did not appear in public for two days: at laſt I learned that he was to dine at the Crown, a tavern: being with ſomebody in a room whence he could have ſeen me come into the houſe, I ſent him word three times that I wanted to ſpeak to him before he came; at laſt being come, I told him that he remembered how he had inſulted me on board his ſhip, and had promiſed to give me ſatisfaction therefor when we ſhould be on ſhore, that I was accordingly come to requeſt it of him: but as his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> had wrote to Mr. Damas to tell the Captains that, whilſt in Holland, there ſhould be no vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or ſomething to the ſame purpoſe, we might in a few hours go out of Holland where we might accompliſh his promiſe and my deſire; he denied knowing any thing about ſaid letter to Mr. Dumas, and added that he would give me no ſatisfaction, but Dr. Franklin would, whom he had wrote to that I had fired upon the Bon-homme Richard during the engagement, and killed many of his men; I replied I knew him well enough not to wonder at his forging ſuch falſhood, in order to avoid giving me the ſatisfaction I requeſted of him, and to charge, if

he could, the Alliance with the blood of above ſixty men he had loſt by his blunders and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct in attacking the Serapis, to whom he muſt have ſurrendered in three-quarters of an hour's engagement, had not the Alliance reſcued him, deſtroyed and made the Serapis yield: ſeeing that I grew warm he ſuddenly withdrew, and went again in the room he came from. Knowing all he was capable of, and fearing that he would tell barely that I was come to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge him, in order to find a charge againſt me; I went in the room and aſked him if he had any orders to ſend on board the Serapis; he ſaid no, and I went away.</p>
            <p>I went back to the Texel; on the 21ſt October, I received the following letter, viz.</p>

            <p>I thought I perceived, by his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> he wanted to give a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble interpretation to his orders to me, ſaying that there was charges againſt me for diſobedience of orders, though there was nothing in them that directed me to obey Capt. Jones; and by the French Miniſter's interfering in the matter of the engagement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there was a plan laid againſt me before I left l'Orient, and Capt. Jones had been directed to take advantage of events to carry it on as he did, being ſure to be backed by his Excellency Benjamin Eranklin, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who, he had owned to me and others, had empowered him when at l'Orient, to take the command of the Alliance from me.</p>
            <p>For what would have become of Capt. Jones's pretended glory, and how could he have bro't any charge againſt me had he owned,—that the Alliance, out of ſeven merchant veſſels which were taken, ſhe alone took five of them, and ſhe was in company with the others when the two other ſmall ones were taken,—his conduct and blunders in general during all the time the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance had been in company with the others,—and in particular in the time of the chaſe and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement

of the 23d September, 1779,—that he began in the Bon-homme Richard to chaſe but two hours after the Alliance and Pallas did, he running or bringing too cloſe to the wind for his pilot ſchooner, by which he miſſed the opportunity of engaging, as he could have done, with the Alliance and Pallas, the enemies during day time, when he might have better ſeen the enemies poſition and force,—that during the chaſe he made no ſignal whatever to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Alliance, and when ſhe went to ſpeak to him he avoided her, thinking the enemies much inferior than they were, and that he could reduce them by giving them each a broad-ſide, without the help of the Alliance,—that he took the worſt poſition to attack the enemies, going on the bow of the headmoſt of them, though he ſaw the Alliance placed on their quarter, which was the beſt one to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n the engagement in,—that he bore his ſhip head-long upon the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies broadſide, which took advantage of his blunder, raked him in ſuch a manner that his ſhip was diſabled and diſordered, the crew much leſſened, and the remnant left their quarter in a ſhort time, without having done any damage to the enemy, not having been in a poſition to fire at him,—that the Alliance began at ſame time he did, to engage the Counteſs of Scarborough (where, had ſhe remained all the engagement long, ſhe could not have been cenſured therefor, as no ſignal was made to the contrary, not even to engage) for twenty minutes with ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that the latter to avoid the continuation thereof, by the ſmoke unperceived, filled her ſails and got ahead, that the Alliance ſeeing it, filled hers, had main and foretack on board, leaving the Pallas, which was two dull ſailing ſhip to get ahead, to engage the Counteſs of Scarborough, and went, ſeeing it immediate neceſſity, to the aſſiſtance of Capt. Jones, who muſt have been in that moment abſent, ſince he did not make a ſignal for it,—that by the only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous manoeuvre, by which the Alliance raked the Serapis the firſt time, ſhe was almoſt as diſabled as the Bon-homme Richard, and muſt have loſt many of her men,—that the Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, in the poſition ſhe was then in, could no better manoeuvre, to inſure the victory againſt the common enemies, than to make the Counteſs of Scarborough ſtrike as ſhe did,—that the Alliance went after as faſt as poſſible, and raked from head to ſtern the Serapis a ſecond time, —that with the ſame diligence ſhe ran a tack and went to rake ſo effectually the Serapis a third time, that ſhe ſtruck, by which Capt. Jones was delivered from the inevitable ſad fate he could expect in falling in the Engliſh hands, —that after all this, Capt. Jones, to anſwer his purpoſe, had the Bon-homme Richard ſunk, becauſe, had ſhe been brought in, it would have been a palpable witneſs againſt him. Had Capt. Jones owned all thoſe truths, he would have been deſpiſed for his ignorance, and called to an account for his conduct and confuſion in all thoſe caſes (not to ſay worſe) during the action, by which he had ſo many mens' lives loſt, and muſt have loſt more ſtill in the action and his ſhip, had not the Alliance, by her ſuperior manoeuvre, in taking all poſſible advantage over the enemies poſition, reſcued him by reducing them, as ſhe did without loſing a man: but Capt. Jones was wonted, when guilty, to lay his faults on others, invented all to clear himſelf and charge me, knowing he was in the ſecret of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, which muſt have paid for the Bon-homme Richard had ſhe been proved to have been loſt by his faults, therefore he knew, had they had no previous deſigns againſt me, they would, to ſave their money, ſupport him with all their power and influence.</p>
            <p>However, thinking that his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> would have charged me with diſobedience of his orders had I not gone, as ordered, to Paris; and his Excellency and Mr. de Sartine the French Miniſter, would have made it appear in the world, that I was really guilty, ſince I would not go there to juſtify myſelf: and on the other hand, being conſcious of my dutifulneſs in all reſpects, and perſuaded that I muſt not only be juſtified, but applauded for my conduct; not conſidering enough that it is not ſufficient to be innocent and dutiful therefor,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:018549_0049_0FA7AD97EBEBAAE8"/>
but there is another condition of abſolute neceſſity, which is the impartiality in the judges, which I could have no reaſons to expect; prefering even to be a victim, rather than to appear guilty, I determined to go, and in conſequence had the undeniable certificate of my conduct by all the officers, ſome my known enemies, all Americans, to whom I repeatedly told not to ſign any thing but that they were certain of. I ordered, by a written order to the Firſt-Lieutenant, to keep the command of the Alliance during my abſence.</p>
            <p>I went to the Helder, where I tarried three days, to have from Capt. Cottineau a certificate of my anſwers to him, when he came to tell me to go on board the Bon-homme Richard; but Capt. Cottineau being ſo ſick that his life was deſpaired of, could not give it to me then. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time I was there, Capt. Spencer, who had been volunteer on board the Alliance du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the laſt cruize, brought me word that Capt. Jones appeared to uſe his uſual tricks in bringing every one he could to ſign a pack of his forged charges againſt me; that he told the officers he had wrote to Paris, and ſilver-handle ſwords would be ſent for them. He made ſome of his Midſhipmen Aid-de-camps on board his ſhip; promiſed that he was going to ſell the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapis and Counteſs of Scarborough to let them have money, &amp;c. &amp;c. Finally, he promiſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion at random, even gave a commiſſion and the command in chief of the Alliance to the Firſt-Lieutenant Mr. Degge (whom I had given my laſt order to) as follows, viz.</p>

            <p>Whilſt I was in Amſterdam, it would have been eaſy for me to overſet Capt.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy in Holland, though Mr. Dumas had told me Dr. Franklin's order againſt any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance whilſt there; therefore too much delicacy prevented me to take the only ſtep to be taken againſt ſuch men as I had to deal with.</p>
            <p>I arrived at Paris November 8th, and went directly at Paſſy to ſee his Excellency Benjamin Franklin <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and told him I was ready to anſwer all charges laid againſt me: he not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting me was ſurpriſed, unprepared, and knew not what to anſwer, at laſt he told me he had yet no charges againſt me, but he expected them ſoon (by which anſwer it appeared that he had commended Captain Jones to make charges againſt me, or Captain Jones muſt have wrote to him, that he met with difficulties to make any, or to bring people to ſign them) I told him I was aſtoniſhed, that he had ordered me to leave the command of the Alliance in a foreign country, and make me come from Holland to Paris, before he had any charges againſt me, he replied they would come, and not knowing what to ſay, he added, I have only Captain Jones's relation: I aſked him whether he had not received alſo the relation, ſketch, &amp;c. of the battle I had ſent him, he ſaid he had: he told me he had wrote me to come only by the French Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter's deſire, and I had better go and ſee him; I aſked him what I had to do with the French Miniſter, and whether he was alſo the United States' Miniſter; he giving me no anſwer, I told him though I was anſwerable to nobody but himſelf, ſince he directed me to go to the French Miniſter, I would go.</p>
            <p>Being at the French Miniſter Mr. de Sartine's hotel, his ſwiſe or porter at the gate, told me the Miniſter was buſy, I went into the houſe and wrote to him that, as ſoon as arrived from Holland, by his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, Eſq's order, I had been to ſee him, that he had told me it was by the deſire of the French Miniſter he had wrote me to come, and had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:018549_0052_0FA7AD9A085D1918"/>
me to come and ſee him, in conſequence thereof, I was come directly, and waiting for admittance to hear what he had to tell me: Mr. de Sartine ſent me word that he was very buſy for the preſent moment, but would write me as ſoon as he could, when to come.—He has never done it.</p>
            <p>Next Monday after I went to Paſſy, to enquire whether his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> had received the ſaid charges, he ſaid he had not, but his grandſon coming in the next inſtant after, having not heard his grandfather's anſwer, hearing me mention charges, ſaid that ſome were in his office; the grandfather rebuked him and ſaid it was not thoſe; upon which I ſaid it was very ſtrange, after having been ordered, as I was, to come to anſwer charges laid againſt me, when arrived, there was none; and after they were come, though I was upon the place ready to anſwer them, they were kept from me, and I was told there was none, which looked as if his Excellency wanted to keep me from the Alliance: he gave me a written order to remain in Paris, and told me to come again the next Monday.</p>
            <p>Being there, I found aſſembled with his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Doctor Pengraff, (one of his Excellency's ſecretary) and Mr. Le Ray de Chaumont; his Excellency told me verbally there were the four following charges againſt me, viz.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Diſobedience of orders.</p>
            <p>Second, Of having fired on the Bon-homme Richard during the engagement on the 23d September.</p>

               </gap> ſoon as poſſible.</p>
            <p>Fourth, For having not taken the fleet the next day after the engagement.</p>
            <p>I obſerved to his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> that there was no body competent judges of thoſe charges, as the firſt one depended whether I had obeyed his orders literally; and the three others required ſea-officers to underſtand the nature of the caſe, and judge whether I had done, or not, all that could be done in theſe caſes, for the beſt; however, that for his ſatisfaction I was going to anſwer every one of them.</p>
            <p>To anſwer the firſt article I ſhowed the order to me of his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> dated April, 28th, 1779, by which, "<hi>He ordered me to put my ſhip and myſelf under Capt. Jones's command, being my ſenior officer, for a cruize only, till my return to France.</hi>" I ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably to that order, I had been on a cruize under Capt. Jones's order, he being on board the Bon-homme Richard, and obeyed him until my own and his return to France, in Port l'Orient, where by the purport of ſaid order ended his command over my ſhip and me: his Excellency replied it could not be called a cruize out of France, becauſe we had cruized then only in the Bay of Biſcay, which was called the French ſea; I told him he might give what interpretation he pleaſed, but there were Engliſh men-of-war and privateers to cruize for, as well as in the channel, and that in his order he had not mentioned any particular place to cruize in, I could not know whether he intended, or not, any other cruize at that time, and therefore having cruized there under Capt. Jone's order, where he laid me, I had fulfilled li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally the contents of his Excellency's order: his Excellency inſiſted by ſimilar reaſons, that that cruize was no real cruize; I told him it appeared he was determined to find me guilty, even againſt his own hand writing proofs to the contrary, and that all which had paſſed, and that I had heard, convinced me of what Capt. Jones had told me, on the 25th September 1779, that his Excellency had given had power to take the command of the Alliance from me, when at l'Orient: and he had not told it to me only, as will appear by the following certificate, viz.</p>

            <p>His Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> denied the fact, and that Capt. Jones could not have ſaid any ſuch thing, and that I wanted to reflect upon him; to put an end to that charge, I ſhowed his Excellency's order to me, dated "Paſſy, July 28th, 1780," in which there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing mentioned that I was, or ſhould be, in any caſe, under Capt. Jones's orders, but it was ſaid, "<hi>But in caſe the Bon-homme Richard was not ready to ſail with you, what Mr. de Chaumont will inform you, then go to cruize in the North Seas, by ſuch route you will judge proper for intercepting the Northen trade to England, &amp;c.</hi>" as I have before mentioned ſpeaking of my departure from l'Orient. That according to his orders, I had applied to Mr. de Chaumont, and enquired whether the Bon-homme Richard would be ready to ſail with the Alliance, that he had given me ſuch an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, as is certified by him heretofore (which he repeated before his Excellency) that I had told him I was not under Capt. Jones's orders, by thoſe he had brought me from his Excellency; that Mr. de Chaumont had directed me to aſk Capt. Jones a copy of his Excellency's orders to him relative to the Alliance or me; that he had given me thereof an extract, which I produced to his Excellency (of which a copy is heretofore) wherein the Alliance's or my name is not mentioned; that I then told Capt. Jones I was not under his orders, by thoſe I had from his Excellency, to which he ſaid not a word.</p>
            <p>That I ſailed out of port l'Orient to Groais alone, not knowing when the Bon-homme Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard could be ready for ſea, if ever ſhe was; that he came there after, where Capt. Jones told me he was going likewiſe, in the North-Sea, where Commodore Johnſtone was cruizing, and ſaid we had better go together, which I agreed to, thinking it for the good of the ſervice, and not derogatory to his Excellency's order to me; that in conſequence the laſt rendezvous for the cruize was agreed and given to be off Flamborough-head, and a concordat drawn and ſigned in caſe of taking any prizes whilſt in company together (new proof I was not under Capt. Jones's orders, as he knew there was no need thereof had I been ſo.) But being off the coaſt of Ireland, where it was propoſed to go or ſend in Limorick river; and upon which coaſt we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſeven days. I told him, I not being under his orders, if he intended to tarry or land there, I would go alone to cruize, as ordered by his Excellency; that Capt. Jones then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended his Excellency's orders to me were of no force, and that I was directly under his immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate orders, though he never offered to juſtify it by giving me a copy of any order he might have had from his Excellency for that cruize concerning the Alliance or me, and even would never give me written orders therefor, though I demanded them ſeveral times, as I had a right to, and could not remain under his orders when they were contrary to thoſe I had from his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency (he knew better than to give me written orders to follow him in his intended landing, &amp;c. as he had no right to do it) therefore, being parted after, by ſtreſs of weather in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his Excellency's order to me, the Alliance had cruized and done alone far more harm to the Engliſh trade than all the ſhips with Capt. Jones together, and I had fulfilled literally his Excellency's orders to me for that cruize.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="unknown:018549_0054_0FA7AD9C51A81C70"/>His Excellency inſiſted I was under Capt. Jones's orders by his to me, and even as being my ſenior officer: I related that (which I have mentioned heretofore) of the Captain of the Continental Frigate called the Queen of France, who was condemned, ſuſpended, and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand took from him for having followed his ſenior officer, in the Frigate Warren, in Boſton, as an inſtance how a Captain was liable to ſuffer when he broke ſuperior orders to follow any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior officer's to the contrary: I added there was another proof in his Excellency's orders to me that I was not under Capt. Jones's, becauſe he intended to land at Shetland and other places, did never cruize, and met only accidentally the Baltic fleet off Flamborough-head (where the Alliance had been cruizing three weeks) as he came there but the very ſame day that we ſaw and engaged them, &amp;c. having been all the while to try to land upon the coaſt of Scotland, without effect: and that in the orders from his Excellency to me, it was expreſſed that I was to cruize in the North Sea, for intercepting the Northern trade to England, which proved thoſe orders to me quite different from thoſe of Capt. Jones. His Excellency replied, that the word cruizing implied as well landing as remaining at ſea; I told him I never underſtood it ſo, but it was croſſing to and fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in a ſtation given: he maintained it was not. I begged to have a Dictionary, which was at laſt procured me, wherein I found and ſhowed his Excellency the word cruize was explained much like what I had ſaid: his Excellency ſaid it was a miſtake of the Printer. What can officers do who is ſubject to receive orders from a ſuperior, who, out of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, uſes ſuch ſubterfuges to find him guilty? I could not help telling him that it was not my fault if there was ſuch miſtake in the Dictionary, and if he had fully explained his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I would have done my utmoſt to fulfil it; and I made this obſervation—ſuppoſing that your Excellency had died, and in the mean time, in following Capt. Jones, in landing without a pilot, I had, by accident, loſt the Frigate Alliance on a rock, &amp;c. and begged his Excellency to ſhow me, in his orders to me, a word which would have juſtified me before Congreſs for loſing their Frigate in following Capt. Jones: his Excellency knowing he could find none, ſaid not a word. If I had followed Capt. Jones, as he wanted me, it would have been eaſier for his Excellency to prove I had broke his orders in following him.</p>
            <p>Having proved obviouſly I was not under Captain Jones's orders, and had fulfilled his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency's to me, I proceeded to the ſecond charge againſt me viz. "<hi>Of having fired upon the Bon-homme Richard on the</hi> 23<hi>d September,</hi> 1779." By ſhewing his Excellency the ſketch, relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and certificates of that engagement, ſigned by all the officers of the Alliance, which he could not ſuſpect to have ſigned it in my favour, knowing they had been at variance with their Captain ever ſince the beginning of the voyage; I explained all the poſitions, evolutions and motions of every ſhip, and all the faults of Capt. Jones, as I have done heretofore in giving the ſketch, &amp;c. His Excellency, who had liſtened attentively, all the while, ſaid after I had ended, I might through miſtake, have fired upon the Bon-homme Richard; I anſwered, admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that for a moment, it would not be a guilt in me, but only a miſtake, which might have happened in the night: ſince it happened even in day time in Admiral Keppel's fleet, when engaged againſt Admiral Count D'orviller's, and nothing was ſaid about it more than that it was a miſtake. But it was not the caſe in our engagement, as I ſhowed him, a ſecond time, by the officers certificate, where it is ſaid, "<hi>As there could be no miſtake made, ſeeing the colours of the ſhips, &amp;c.</hi>"—But Capt. Jones charged me with it to cover his compounded faults and blunders, by which he had loſt ſo many men, which he could not account for; and in that caſe as all others, to extricate himſelf, he wanted to charge me with their blood. I went further, ſaying, if I had been black minded enough to have Capt.

have accompliſhed it, and no body could have blamed me, as I would have been in my ſtation: moreover, if by a refined treachery, and blackneſs of mind, which can never be imagined, but by thoſe who are capable of perpetrating ſuch a deed, I had been willing to deſtroy Captain Jones, &amp;c. as hinted by him: as I did not myſelf fire a cannon, I muſt have told the officers of my black deſign, which would not have failed to take the command from me and put me in irons therefor; but ſuppoſing further, I had ſeduced or bribed the officers to have done it, would the Gunners and all the crew have obeyed them in firing upon their American brothers on board the Bon-homme Richard? His Excellency ſaid it was not likely; then ſaid I, ſince Capt. Jones is capable of deviſing ſuch charge againſt me, to juſtify himſelf and appear mighty and glorious, after having been releaſed by the Alliance from the ſad fate he was ſo nigh falling into, it may be imagined what he is capable of.</p>
            <p>I proceeded to the third charge againſt me, "<hi>Of not having aſſiſted the Bon-homme Richard as ſoon as poſſible.</hi>" I ſaid, ſuppoſing that the Alliance had remained all the engagement long, in her ſtation, without giving any aſſiſtance whatever to the Bon-homme Richard, ſhe could not have been blamed therefor, having done that duty of hers, as no ſignal for preparing engaging the enemies, and aſſiſting the Bon-homme Richard, were ſeen from the Alliance: but inſtead of that, having been firſt to take her ſtation on the weather-quarter, at two muſkets ſhot diſtance from the enemies ſhips, ſhe began to engage with the ſtern-moſt of them, at the ſame time the Bon-homme Richard and Serapis began together; and as ſoon as the Pallas was come down, ſhe left her, being a dull ſailing ſhip in a light wind, to engage the Counteſs of Scarborough; and ſhe, the Alliance, went with all poſſible ſpeed, to the aſſiſtance of the Bon-homme Richard, which by her bad conduct in the attack, had been almoſt totally deſtroyed; and the Alliance, without any ſignal being made, by her good manoeuvres, during the whole engagement, reduced both the enemies ſhips to ſurrender, as is proved by the ſketch, relation, and certificate of all the officers of the Alliance, by which ſhe did not only her ſimple duty, but all that could be done; all which coroborates with the two Engliſh Captains letter to the Engliſh Admiralty (to be found in the Engliſh Magazine, for October, 1779) in that one of Capt. Richard Pearſon of the Serapis, it is ſaid, "<hi>At the ſame time the largeſt of the two Frigates</hi>" (which he ſays after was the Alliance) "<hi>kept ſailing round us the whole action and raking us fore and aft, by which means ſhe killed or wounded almoſt every man on the quarter and main decks.—When the Frigate coming acroſs our ſtern, and pouring her broad-ſide into us again, without our being able to bring a gun to bear upon her, I found it in vain, and in ſhort, impracticable, from the ſituation we were in, to ſtand out any longer with the leaſt proſpect of ſucceſs; I therefore ſtruck.</hi>"—By which it appears, that that Captain owns the Alliance killed and wounded almoſt every man on his main and quarter decks, and at half paſt ten, the ſaid Frigate came acroſs his ſhip's ſtern and poured her broad-ſide into it, without his being able to bring a gun to bear upon her, which is a full apology of the Alliance's conduct, as ſhe not only deſtroyed all thoſe which were deſtroyed, but conducted it in ſuch manner that the Serapis could not hurt her, and the Serapis could ſtand it no longer, and therefore ſtruck.—Captain Thomas Piercy, of the Counteſs of Scarborough, in his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Captain Pearſon, ſays, "<hi>About two minutes after you began to engage with the largeſt of the enemy's ſquadron, I received a broad-ſide from one of the Frigates, which I inſtantly returned, and continued engaging her for about twenty minutes, when ſhe dropt aſtern;</hi>" which Frigate could be no other than the Alliance, as the Pallas came down after,—"<hi>And another Frigate coming on my larboard quarter. In that ſituation I ſaw it was in vain to contend any longer, with any proſpect of ſucceſs againſt ſuch ſuperior force, I ſtruck to the Pallas.</hi>"—Being engaged with the Pallas, it could be no other than the Alliance, after having raked the Serapis, who coming upon the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:018549_0056_0FA7AD9DF267D2E8"/>
quarter of the Counteſs of Scarborough to rake her, made her ſtrike to the Pallas ſhe was engaged with, therefore the Alliance made no motion whatever during that action. But great advantage to her party was reaped by it.—But if the Alliance had bore head-long upon the Counteſs of Scarborough's broad-ſide, ſhe would have been ſerved by her, as the Bon-homme Richard had been by the Serapis; but thinking her duty was to deſtroy the enemies as much as ſhe could, with as little loſs as poſſible, ſhe in conſequence thereof, took ſo well the advantage of every poſition, that ſhe contributed in a great degree, to the ſucceſs of the battle, without having a ſingle man killed, which conduct Capt. Jones wanted to make appear to his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, becauſe ſhe had been ſo ſucceſsful.</p>
            <p>His Excellency ſaying nothing, I proceeded to anſwer the fourth charge againſt me, "<hi>Why I had not gone and take the fleet the next day after the engagement,</hi>" ſaying that when I ſailed from l'Orient, the whole crew of the Alliance was compoſed only of two hundred and twenty men in all, out of which the Alliance had manned five prizes ſhe had taken. That as ſoon as the Serapis had been abandoned, going towards the ſhore, Capt. Jones ſent word to the Alliance to go and take the priſoners out of the Serapis, which ſhe did, and took her in tow to draw her from the land, and put forty of her men on board; that the weather being very foggy when ſhe ſaw the other ſhips, the Bon-homme Richard ſhowed a ſignal to ſend to that ſhip both her men and people, that the Alliance ſent all her boats and all the men ſhe could ſpare, keeping not above ſixty men of her crew on board, although ſhe had two hundred and twenty-five priſoners to guard; that the fleet was out of ſight, conſequently ſhe was not in a ſituation, without boat, and with ſo few hands, to go in ſearch of them; beſide, Capt. Jones never made a ſignal therefor to the Alliance, nor to the other, though they were more able, the Vengeance having her whole crew to do it; therefore the Alliance was in the impoſſibility of doing better in this caſe, as well as in all others.</p>
            <p>I told his Excellency that out of complaiſance I had enumerated all the motions of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſhips to him, but as he was not, perhaps, converſant with the nautick tactick, as he had the copy of the ſketch, relation, and certificate of the officers of the Alliance, he might carry it to Verſailles and aſk Mr. de Sartine to have a number of ſea-officers (as there were no Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans to be had) to examine it, and if they ſaid the Alliance had not done during that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement all ſhe could do, I would look upon myſelf as condemned, knowing the French offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers were men of honor who would not condemn me unleſs they found ſome fault in my conduct: his Excellency expecting, I ſuppoſe, ſome fault or other might be found in it, accepted the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, and it might have been examined for all I know, but ſome time after (as he always found ſome evaſion for prolonging the time, before I could have made my defence, by giving time to Capt. Jones to ſail in the Alliance; one week he had the gout, another he was indiſpoſed, others he was very buſy, &amp;c.) his Excellency told me he had carried the ſaid ſketch, relation, &amp;c. to Verſailles, and had aſked the French Miniſter, Mr. de Sartine, to have it examined by ſome French ſea-officers, but he had refuſed to have it done.</p>
            <p>I muſt obſerve here by the bye, that it appeared to me very ſurpriſing that Mr. de Sartine, who earneſtly wrote to his Excellency to have me brought to an account for my conduct during ſaid engagement, would refuſe to have the proper voucher thereof examined. It increaſed in me the following ſuſpicions which were, that Mr. de Sartine who was the cauſe of my leaving the French ſervice, was apprehenſive (my character being well eſtabliſhed, as may appear even in a London magazine, December 1779. <hi>In the juſtifying memorial of the K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Jones who was very likely in the ſecret of the concerned, muſt be countenanced and ſupported in his relation, &amp;c. as he might diſcloſe what he knew; and if the truth came to light, the concerned might have paid for the Bon-homme Richard: on the other hand, his Excellency was not, perhaps, unconcerned for the concerned, in the firſt place; in the ſecond, he might have took it for ſound policy to ſacrifice my character to the French Miniſter's plan, and ſatisfy himſelf in taking the command of the Alliance from me, and giving it to Capt. Jones, as he had already (according to Capt. Jones's report) empowered him to take it from me, when at l'Orient, before the ſecond cruize: beſides, as I have learned ſince, that orders of Congreſs had been ſent to him, March 1779, to pay me the ſum of twelve thouſand livres gratuity for bringing ſaid ſhip from Marſeilles, which he never did, he might have had ſome private views on that account, and if he ſucceeded in preventing my return to America, I might die, without learning what Congreſs had done for me:)—Mr. le Ray de Chaumont, who was the American and French Miniſter's agent, in fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out the veſſels at l'Orient, and who was called in by his Excellency to her my defence, was likewiſe in behalf of the concerned, and intruſted with the Miniſter's plan: Their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon plan and intereſt as intruſted, by all appearance, to Capt. Jones, to be put in execution, who having been brought up in controverſies with juſtice, was capable, by his uſual tricks, of doing it, without any fear that his delicacy could obſtruct his ambitious views, which was eaſy for him, as he knew he muſt be ſeconded by my judges in deſtroying me, or muſt and would at laſt fall by juſtice, and drag with him his abettors.</p>
            <p>Having received advice from Amſterdam, which was confirmed by Mr. de Chaumont, that Capt. Jones had the command of the Alliance, I begged as a favor from his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> to let me know and ſhow me the right he had to take from me the command of the Alliance, given me by Congreſs reſolve, and give it to Capt. Jones! He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he would be accountable for it to Congreſs. I muſt ſay again, what can an officer do who is under a ſuperior, who make ſuch abuſe of the power intruſted to him, to deſtroy one out of partiality, againſt all juſtice, to favour another?</p>
            <p>His Excellency brought in a pack of charges made againſt me, containing twenty-five ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, which he had kept till then, from me; I told him before I looked at them, that I had anſwered every one of thoſe articles, which deſerved to be anſwered; as I had proved I was not under Capt. Jones's orders; that I had fulfilled his Excellency's order to me, and that the Alliance had effected, during the engagement and after, all ſhe could, for the good of the ſervice; nevertheleſs, I would anſwer them; they were as follow:

                     <p n="9">"<hi>9</hi>th. On the morning of the <hi>23</hi>d of September, when the Bon-homme Richard, after being off the Spurn, came in ſight of the Alliance and the Pallas off Flamborough-head, Capt. Landais diſtinctly told Capt. Cottineau that if it was, as it appeared, a <hi>50</hi> gun ſhip, they muſt run away, although he muſt have been ſure that the Pallas, <hi>from her heavy ſailing,</hi> muſt have fallen a ſacrifice.</p>
                     <p n="10">"<hi>10</hi>th. In the afternoon of the ſame day, Capt. Landais paid no attention to ſignals, particularly the ſignal of preparation and for the line, which was made with great care and very diſtinctly on board the Bon-homme Richard.</p>
                     <p n="11">"<hi>11</hi>th. Although the Alliance was a long way ahead of the Bon-homme Richard, when bearing down on the Baltic fleet, yet Capt. Landais lay out of gun ſhot to windward, until the Bon-homme Richard, paſſed and cloſely engaged the Serapis, and then inſtead of coming to cloſe action with the Counteſs of Scarobrough, the Alliance fired at very long ſhot.</p>
                     <p n="12">"<hi>12</hi>th. He continued to windward, and a conſiderable time after the action began, fell aſtern and ſpoke the Pallas, leaving the Counteſs of Scarborough in the wake of the ſhips engaged, and at free liberty to rake the Bon-homme Richard.</p>
                     <p n="13">"<hi>13</hi>th. After the Bon-homme Richard and Serapis were made faſt a long ſide of each other, as in the margin, (which was not done till an hour after the engagement began) Capt Landais, <hi>out of muſket ſhot,</hi> raked the Bon-homme Richard with croſs-bar and grape-ſhot, &amp;c. which killed a number of men, diſmounted ſundry guns, put the ſide lights cut, and ſilenced all the <hi>12</hi> pounders.</p>
                     <p n="14">"<hi>14</hi>th. The Alliance then ran down towards the Pallas and Counteſs of Scarborough, that were at that time engaged at a conſiderable diſtance to leeward of the Bon-homme Richard and Serapis; and Capt. Landais hovered about there out of gun-ſhot, and without firing, till ſome time after the Counteſs of Scarborough had ſtruck, and then bore down under his topſails, and ſpoke firſt the prize, and then the Pallas, aſking a number of queſtions.</p>
                     <p n="15">"<hi>15</hi>th. At laſt Capt. Landais made ſail under his topſails to work up to windward, but made tacks before he (being within the range of grape ſhot, and at the longeſt three quarters of an hour before the Serapis ſtruck) fired a ſecond broad-ſide into the Bon-homme Richard's larboard quarter, the part whereof was fired when the Alliance was not more than three points abaft the Bon-homme

Richard's beam, although many tongues had cried from the Bon-homme Richard that Capt. Landais was firing into the wrong ſhip, and prayed him to lay the enemy along ſide. Three large lanthorns with proper ſignal wax candies in them and well lighted, had alſo previouſly to his firing, been long over the bow-quarter, and waiſt of the Bon-homme Richard, in a horizontal line, which was the ſignal of reconnoitring and the ſhips, the one having a high poop, and being all black, the other having a low ſtern, with yellow ſides, were eaſily diſtinguiſhable, it being full moon.</p>
                     <p n="16">"<hi>16</hi>th. The Alliance then paſſed at very conſiderable diſtance, along the larboard or off ſide of the Bon-homme Richard, and having tacked and gained the wind, ran down again to leeward, and in croſſing the Bon-homme Richards' bow, Capt. Landais raked her with a third broadſide, after being conſtantly called to from the Bon-homme Richard, not to fire, but to lay the enemy along ſide.</p>
                     <p n="17">"<hi>17</hi>th. Sundry men were killed and wounded by the broadſides mentioned in the two laſt articles.</p>
                     <p n="18">"<hi>18</hi>th. Capt. Landais never paſſed on the off ſide of the Serapis, nor could that ſhip ever bring a gun to bear on the Alliance, at any time during the engagement.</p>
                     <p n="19">"<hi>19</hi>th. The leaks of the Bon-homme Richard increaſed much after being fired upon by the Alliance, and as the moſt dangerous ſhot which the Bon-homme Richard received under water, were under the larboard bow and quarter, they muſt have come from the Alliance, for the Serapis was on the other ſide.</p>
                     <p n="20">"<hi>20</hi>th. Several people on board the Alliance told Capt. Landais at different times, that he fired on the wrong ſhip, others refuſed to fire.</p>
                     <p n="21">"<hi>21</hi>ſt. The Alliance fired only three vollies, which within gun-ſhot of the Bon-homme Richard and Serapis.</p>
                     <p n="22">"<hi>22</hi>d. The morning after the engagement, Capt. Landais acknowledged on board the Serapis, that he raked each time with grape ſhot, which he knew would ſcatter.</p>
                     <p n="23">"<hi>23</hi>d. Capt. Landais has acknowledged ſince the action, that he would have thought it no harm if the Bon-homme Richard had ſtruck, for it would have given him an opportunity to retake her, and to take the Serapis.</p>
                     <p n="24">"<hi>24</hi>th. He has frequently declared that he was the only American in the ſquadron, and that he was not under the orders of Capt. Jones.</p>
                     <p n="25">"<hi>25</hi>th. In coming into Texel, he declared that if Capt. Jones ſhould hoiſt a broad pendant he would, to vex him, hoiſt another.</p>

Jones had been a month miſrepreſenting facts, and having them ſigned by men who dreaded to be detected for having left their quarters during the ſlaughter made on board the Bon-homme Richard by the Serapis (as may be ſeen in Capt. Jones's relation) that the younger were brought to ſign it firſt, with Lieutenant-Colonel Wir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, who appears, nominally, detected in ſaid relation; moreover, it appears that Capt. Jones had no real weighty charges to lay againſt me, ſince he invented or miſconſtructed trifling fact to charge me with; however, to leave no room for his Excellency to ſhow he had a right to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute any plan againſt me, I made the following anſwers in writing.</p>

               <body>
                  <p>"The following articles are the anſwers to the five and twenty articles made by Capt.

                  <p>"The <hi>1</hi>ſt. article has been anſwered and examined in a Court-martial, kept at l'Orient; for which the Firſt-Lieutenant of the Bon-homme Richard was condemned and ſent away by a ſecond ſentence.</p>

Parke, who was but little way from him, aſked him whether there was any muſket loaded, and if he had the arm-cheſt key; Capt.

Landais almoſt convinced of what he imagined before, ſeeing that manoeuvre, confuſion, &amp;c. ran down in the cabin, and aſked Jube (Mr. Blodget's negro) who was laying in the cabin, for his piſtols; Jube told him they were in one of the trunks. Capt. Landais ſtaid in the cabin only the time of aſking the queſtion, and having the anſwer, which did not laſt more than five ſeconds, and he went back immediately upon the quarter deck, the ſame way he had gone down, (by the larboard gangway, the companion being covered with the mizen-maſt pieces and rigging) and did not load his piſtols"</p>

            <p>N. B I might have added that Capt.

Jones cauſed to be broke, and had him condemned by a greater injuſtice ſtill, to be broke and rendered incapable to ſerve his own country, America; all which I was told by Lieut.

After</hi> 2, <hi>A. M. the Bon-homme Richard, better than three miles leeward of us, made ſignal for forming the line of battle. As I was windward of her, and always maſter at any time to bear away in my ſtation, I continued chaſing; the wind very weak, at four, came Eaſt by South; then I began to bear away little; the chaſe being

yet above five miles diſtance windward, the weather ſo hazy that I could not diſtinguiſh what ſhip ſhe was, ſeeing I could not come up with her before night, and the Bon-homme Richard falling lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of us, which had made a ſignal not to loſe ſight of the fleet; at</hi> 6 <hi>o'clock I bore right upon her; at nine A.

            <p>N. B. I could have added that if Capt. Jones had really a mind to know who ſhe was, he ſhould have ordered the Cerf cutter, a faſt ſailing and proper veſſel for that purpoſe, to go and ſee who ſhe was, which ſhe might eaſily have done; he ſhould have ordered the brig Vengeance to keep between the Bon-homme Richard and the Alliance, to repeat the ſignals, and from one to the other, to the weather-moſt, by which the ſignal might have been diſcernable; but Capt. Jones had no notion of it, nor which veſſel was fit to get better windward: but the Alliance had gained only four miles during ten hours of freſh breeze upon the chaſe, and could not gain five in two hours, being in the wind's eye, and in almoſt a calm weather, before night: moreover the wind had been eaſterly the four laſt days before, and there was ſome ſea, in which the Bon-homme Richard could ſail as well as the Alliance, for all that, the latter gained about four miles in the wind's eye, more than the former, which proves ſhe did not her utmoſt to come up, as did the Alliance, with the chaſe.</p>

            <p>N. B. I could have added that Capt. Jones had never aſked me ſatisfaction for the diſreſpect and impertinence the <hi>Commander of the ſquadron</hi> pretended I had behaved towards him; but to the contrary, he had refuſed meanly, when in Amſterdam, to give me ſatisfaction, though he had promiſed it, for his abuſing me on board his ſhip, and to prevent my giving him his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, he thought it was an addition to his other motives, to charge me.</p>

            <p>N. B. And I could have added by the different courſe the Bon-homme Richard and the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance kept, the latter gained above fifty leagues on the former towards Fair Iſland, where we were to go. Since the Alliance chaſed about ten leagues towards the Weſt, after the Betſey ſhip, before ſhe took her, and ſhe was a whole day manning of her, during which time the Bon-homme Richard kept her courſe to the Eaſt, therefore there was no ignorance on the part of the Alliance's courſe; but I leave to judge whether there was none on board the Bon-homme Richard for loſing ſo much way by the courſe ſhe kept. It was very ſtrange that Capt. Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dais was the only one charged of ignorance or bad deſign by Capt. Jones and all his abettors, when the Pallas was in the ſame caſe. I could have added further, that the Bon-homme Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard was the only one which was the cauſe of that ſeparation, as the Pallas bore the light a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern, and was the leading ſhip, and was followed by the Bon-homme Richard, which did not follow her, ſince they were parted, and the Alliance, which was the ſtern-moſt ſhip, was too far diſtant, to ſee the Pallas' light, to follow her; therefore it was the fault of ſomebody on board the Bon-homme Richard, if we were all parted; but Capt. Jones has particular reaſon for charging me, and no body but me: moreover, it muſt be obſerved that Lieut. Col. Wirbert, who was on board the Bon-homme Richard, ſigned this article, though he could not know what paſſed on board the Alliance, the others who ſigned that article had ſigned a certificate to the contrary, moreover I was not upon deck when it happened.</p>

               <hi>Article</hi> 8<hi>th. The ſeparation on the</hi> 8<hi>th September, was owing to bad weather and accident; for at</hi> 7 <hi>o'clock P. M. all the ſhips laid to, the head to the S. S. E. the wind at W. N. W. at half paſt ſix, the Bon-homme Richard had her main-tack put on board, beſides her fore-tack ſhe had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; at</hi> 9 <hi>o'clock the wind ſhifted to N. W. the Captain ordered to keep the ſhip S. W. the Alliance ſaw but a light now and then, to which ſhe anſwered, but no other ſignal was perceived; Capt. Landais ordered to ſteer to the S. W. becauſe the ſea came from the W. N. W. and if he had kept cloſe to the wind, he might in a high head ſea, meet with ſome accident with his bowſprit, which lye ſo flat, that every great ſea went over the bowſprit yard; he had the ſhip ſteered to prevent this by preventing the great offing, in which heavy ſeas are apt to ſhip in; ſeeing the other ſhips a-ſtern, he ordered the fore-top-maſt-ſtay-ſail to be lowered down, and the weather-main-brace to be hauled in, for two reaſons, one to eaſe the main-yard and ſail, the wind blowing very hard; the other, to have the upper part of the main-ſail ſhivering, not to work the ſhip a-head: we did not go into the trough of the ſea, that came from the W. N. W. at day-light it was yet very ſqually until noon, and I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected always to ſee the other ſhips when clear weather, but ſince I have learned it was by accident I did not ſee them the next day; that the Bon-homme Richard at</hi> 8 <hi>o'clock in the evening, had had her fore-ſail ſplit, and we ſaw no ſignal for that accident. At one o'clock the wind came N. N. W; the ſea abated a little, the Alliance ſteered W. S. W. at</hi> 5 <hi>o'clock ſhe ſteered Weſt; which courſe may

ſhow whether Capt. Landais intended to join the other ſhips. The Vengeance alſo parted the two others in the night. The ſame morning Mr. Buckley told Capt. Landais that the bolts that went though the ſtem and cut-water, had given way by the pitching of the ſhip, I had it ſecured as ſoon at the ſea was ſmooth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>N. B. I could have added it was the fault of ſomebody on board the Bon-homme Richard not to make a proper ſignal when her fore-ſail was ſplit, by want of which the Alliance could not clue up, with prudence, her main-ſail and remain under bare pole, to be boarded by the others a-ſtern. But Capt. Jones and his abettors charged me only of his own fault, though the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance was alſo parted by it. It may be obſerved again that Lieut. Col. Wirbert, Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Engineer, has ſigned alſo that article of what paſſed on board the Alliance that night and the day after being ſeparated, though he was on board the Bon-homme Richard: I muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that Lieut. Col. Wirbert was very likely forced ſome how to ſign thoſe articles by Capt. Jones, as he was the only witneſs who could underſtand Engliſh, in the poop cabin of the Bon-homme Richard, when Capt. Jones abuſed me there. Capt. Jones fearing that he might tell the truth on that account, could bring thoſe two articles he had ſigned to prove he was not admiſſible to give his teſtimony in any caſe whatever.</p>

In the morning at</hi> 3 <hi>o'clock (of the</hi> 23<hi>d September) bting in ſight of two ſails who were the Bon-homme Richard and the Vengeance: the Pallas came and aſked Capt. Landais if the largeſt was a ſixty-four gun ſhip, if he would attack them; Capt. Landais anſwered no, not even a ſixty, and if ſhe was above fifty he would have nothing to do with them.</hi>"</p>
            <p>N. B. And I would have added that Capt. Jones even altered the depoſition of Capt. Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineau, given to him, ſaying that I told Capt. Cottineau that we muſt run away if it was a fifty gun ſhip; though Capt. Cottineau told that I ſaid we had nothing better to do than to make the beſt of our way, if ſhe was above fifty; which implies a ſixty gun ſhip.</p>
            <p>"<hi>Article</hi> 10<hi>th. Capt. Landais indeed paid no attention to the ſignals made the ſame afternoon but to that of chaſe, for no other was ſeen from on board the Alliance.</hi>"</p>
            <p>N. B. And I could have added that Capt. Jones and all his abettors, were no more tacticians than they were true; for what can they mean by <hi>the line?</hi> they could not pretend that wherever the Alliance was, ſhe was not upon a line, as a line might be imagined from one of the ſhip to the other wherever they were, that proves even if the Bon-homme Richard had made a ſignal of a line indiſcriminately to the Alliance, and ſhe had ſeen it, it would have ſhowed clearly that Capt. Jones knew not what he was about.</p>
            <p>"<hi>Article</hi> 11<hi>th. Although the Alliance got a long way a-head of the Bon-homme Richard, when bearing down on the Baltic fleet's convoy, and Capt. Landais brought to, windward about gun-ſhot, on the ſtarboard quarter of the two Engliſh men of war, waiting for the Bon-homme Richard, until the Serapis and Counteſs of Scarborough, about</hi> 7 <hi>o'clock, wore and came to, lying on the larboard tack; then Capt. Landais filled his top-ſails to go and take the ſame poſition, upon the larboard quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the enemy's, as he had before on the ſtarboard one; at the ſame time to ſpeak to the Bon-homme Richard, who was coming down, to know what mode of attack to make, accordingly the Alliance paſſing between the enemies and the Bon-homme Richard, hailed the latter, which did not hear of would not anſwer, and hauled her wind; then the Alliance went two muſket ſhot off, upon the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board quarter of the enemy, where ſhe was hailed by the Counteſs of Scarborough, and waited there for the Bon-homme Richard, thinking ſhe would attack the enemy upon their quarter, but ſhe attacked by the head, and at the ſame time the Alliance and Counteſs of Scarborough began to fire together.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>N. B. And I could have added that by the fault of ſomebody on board the Bon-homme Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, ſhe did not come down to engage the enemy as ſoon as ſhe could have done; that the

Alliance was long before the engagement began, two muſket-ſhots diſtance from the enemy, and had ſhe ran head-long upon the Counteſs of Scarborough's broadſide, as awkwardly as the Bon-homme Richard did upon the Serapis, ſhe muſt alſo have been deſtroyed, our ſhips and the battle loſt, with alſo many mens lives.</p>
            <p>"<hi>Article</hi> 12<hi>th. The Alliance, Serapis and Counteſs of Scarborough, were lying to when the engagement began; when the Counteſs of Scarborough found the fire of the Alliance too heavy for her, ſhe filled her topſails, and by the ſmoke was not ſeen by the Alliance until ſome time after ſhe was get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a-head; as ſoon as perceived, the Alliance's topſails were filled, and had her main and fore-tacks on board; the Pallas coming down was hailed; Capt.

            <p>N. B. I could have added that had the Alliance remained in her ſtation, and continued to engage the Counteſs of Scarborough, no body would have blamed her; and the Bon-homme Richard muſt have ſoon ſtruck to the enemy, by her not making a ſignal of aſſiſtance; but the Alliance ſeeing the bad ſituation ſhe was in, by her own fault, had no need of ſignal to know what to do to reſcue her, and of courſe did it.</p>

            <p>N. B. I might have added, by which broad-ſide ſhe killed and wounded great many people on board the Serapis, as mentioned by the Captain of that ſhip: and if it had been an hour after the beginning of the engagement, the Bon-homme Richard ſhould have been totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the enemy before that time; however, it was before the Bon-homme Richard made any ſignal for aſſiſtance, that the Alliance reſcued, out of her own accord, the Bon-homme Richard; and the Alliance did not fire at all upon her, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> certified by all the officers of the Alliance; and all the twelve-pounders of the Bon-homme Richard had been long before the Alliance raked the Serapis, ſilenced and abandoned, and the lights put out, as even ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by Capt. Jones, in his own relation, which proves his falſhood in it, as in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles he had ſigned by his abettors.</p>
            <p>"<hi>Article</hi> 14<hi>th. The Alliance being already before the wind, ran direct to the Pallas and Counteſs of Scarborough that were at that time engaged two-thirds of a gun-ſhot diſtance, by the lee bow of the Bon-homme Richard, and then did not fire at all, at the Counteſs of Scarborough, but went di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to rake her; when ſhe ſaw their fire ceaſed, ſhe hailed the Counteſs of Scarborough, who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſhe was ſtruck, then hailed the Pallas, who confirmed it, and worked the ſhip, that moment, to take the larboard tack, and had the main and foretack on board, the gibb and mizenſtay-ſail hoiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, but paſſing by the Counteſs of Scarborough, ſome of the Alliance's men aſked ſeveral queſtions, and we did not l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>N. B. I might have ſaid that Capt. Jones and his abettors invented not only common falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood, in order to charge me, but they impeached me of impoſſibilities, for the whole engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment laſted only two hours and a quarter in very ſmall wind. In their 13th article it is ſaid,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:018549_0066_0FA7ADAB2D70F710"/>
that the Alliance came to the aſſiſtance of the Bon-homme Richard only an hour after the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement was begun: in their 15th article they ſay that the Alliance gave a ſecond broad-ſide three-quarters of an hour before the Serapis ſtruck; there remains only half an hour's time to bear down the firſt time to rake the Serapis, to go down to the Counteſs of Scarborough and Pallas, engaged, as they ſay, at a conſiderable diſtance leeward of the Bon-homme Richard and Serapis, &amp;c. to run cloſe to the wind enough to gain windward of theſe two ſhips, to tack about, bear down again to give the ſecond broad-ſide to the Serapis; all which evolutions and courſes, made with all poſſible ſpeed, ſuppoſing the Counteſs of Scarborough and Pallas had been half mile leeward of the Bon-homme Richard and Serapis, it would have required above an hour and an half's time to be performed; therefore the Counteſs of Scarborough was not half that diſtance; the Alliance came to the aſſiſtance of the Bon-homme Richard in leſs than three-quarters of an hour after the engagement began: ſhe did not hover about, as is ſaid in their article, but made all poſſible ſpeed in going to make the Counteſs of Scarborough ſtrike, and after went to reſcue the Bon-homme Richard; and thoſe 13, 14, and 15 articles of theirs, well conſidered by ſea-faring men, will not only prove that the Alliance did all that could be done for the beſt; but moreover, that Capt. Jones and his abettors muſt be no ſeamen to forge ſuch articles againſt me.</p>
            <p>"<hi>Article</hi> 15<hi>th. Capt. Landais went as faſt as wind permitted, a-head of the Serapis, when he tacked about</hi> (but made no tacks) <hi>and paſſing a-head of her, a muſket-ſhot off, gave her a broad-ſide, but the guns being pointed too high, the ſhot went moſtly into the foreſail of the Serapis; and there was no miſtake made for all the lanthorn of ſignal, &amp;c. were not ſeen: we heard confuſed voices tell us to lie the enemy along ſide; all this was not done better than three quarters of an hour before the Serapis ſtruck.</hi>"</p>
            <p>"<hi>Article</hi> 16<hi>th. The Alliance paſſed within piſtol-ſhot diſtance along the larboard or off ſide of the Bon-homme Richard; after having paſſed her, ſhe went cloſe to the wind for above twenty minutes, until ſhe could fetch the Serapis; then ſhe tacked about, went cloſe to the wind, and ran down again by the ſtern of the Serapis, and raked her, gun by gun, as they paſſed by, pointing at a light that was in the Serapis's cabin, as they had been told to do, the firſt time the Alliance raked her, and all the guns were fired ſeparately, ſo well that the Serapis ſtruck her colours, before all the broadſide was fired; for two guns remained loaded, which ſhows the preciſion and coolneſs of the Gunners and crew; the men between deck of the Serapis, did not know their colours was ſtruck, for they fired a gun after.</hi>"</p>
            <p>N. B. I could have added, that their 16th article is as falſe and as ill conſtructed as all the reſt; for if I had paſſed a conſiderable diſtance leeward of the Bon-homme Richard, the Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance muſt be ſo much the more to leeward, and conſequently run a tack the longer, and after being tacked about, would have had ſo much more way to come back before ſhe could have bore to rake the Serapis; all which would have required more than three-quarters of an hour: moreover, if the Alliance had laid along ſide of the Serapis (which was unadviſable, as we had ſeen the fire blaze on board the Serapis) the latter would not have ſuffered ſo much as ſhe did by being raked the laſt time, but would have fired her larboard broad-ſide in the Alliance and engaged her, which would have given the enemy yet a chance to be victorious, but was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented thereof by the Alliance raking her, as it proved.</p>
            <p>"<hi>Article</hi> 17<hi>th. Capt. Landais thinks alſo that there were many men killed and wounded on board the Serapis, but there would have been many more, if the Gunners had pointed their pieces lower.</hi>"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="unknown:018549_0067_0FA7ADABF3531D48"/>"<hi>Article</hi> 18<hi>th. Capt. Landais never paſſed on the off ſide of the Serapis; he owns it, and with modeſty he thanks the ſubſcribers of that article, for their encomium in it on his conduct; but it is too great; being always ready to acknowledge his faults, he muſt own alſo, he went a little too far the firſt time, upon the larboard quarter of the Serapis, who fired ſeveral of her lower battery guns, at the Alliance; and if any of his men had been killed or wounded by their ſhots, he would have reproached it himſelf all his life-time; but they went through the ſails and between the maſts, without much damage.</hi>"</p>
            <p>"<hi>Article</hi> 19<hi>th. The leaks of the Bon-homme Richard increaſed much, though the Alliance had ſilenced part of the Serapis's guns, there were ſome of her lower batteries that conſtantly kept firing; and as the moſt dangerous ſhot which the Bon-homme Richard received under water, were under the larboard bow and quarter, it is moſt likley it was done by the Serapis; as the Serapis could not hit her on her ſtarboard ſide line of water, the Serapis and Bon-homme Richard lying cloſe, one ſtarboard ſide againſt the other's ſtarboard ſide, as repreſented in the margin article</hi> 13<hi>th; the two ſhips join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by their middle, the guns of that part could not be puſhed out, conſequently not pointed downward; but thoſe of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ow and quarter, by the form of the two ſhips, had more play, but could not be point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perpendicularly enough to ſtrike the ſtarboard ſide of the Bon-homme Richard, between wind and water: The ſeals of the Serapis's lower ports, under the bow and quarter, where at leaſt four feet above the ſurface of the water, the middle of the gun about one foot higher, ſuppoſing the gun eight feet and a half long, the gun pointed low one foot in its length, the ſhots muſt go about ſix-and-thirty feet before it could reach the line of water, which was the breadth of the Bon-homme Richard in thoſe parts; ſo that the ſhots went on the larboard ſide line of water of the Bon-homme Richard, not, may be, the firſt, ſecond, nor the third; becauſe, beſides the ſtarboard ſide, there was the lower guns deck to go through, but the two ſhips being faſtened together, and the guns always ſhootig on the ſame ſpot of the ſtarboard ſide, made a hole in it, after in the deck and next in the larboard ſide.</hi>"</p>
            <p>"<hi>Article</hi> 20<hi>th. Capt. Landais never miſtook one ſhip for the other, and he and Mr. Buckley told every time before the Alliance came to give her broadſide, which of the two ſhips was the Bon-homme Richard and which was the Serapis: if any was ordered to fire upon the Bon-homme Richard, they were in the right to refuſe it.</hi>"</p>
            <p>"<hi>Article</hi> 21<hi>ſt. The Alliance fired but three volies, while within muſket-ſhot of the Serapis.</hi>"</p>
            <p>N. B. I could have added, that Capt. Jones and his abettors, though they charge me that the Alliance gave three broad-ſides to the Bon-homme Richard, and at ſame time ſay that the Alliance fired thus but three broad-ſides, proves their falſhood, and that the Alliance fired really and with great effect upon the Serapis, and they wiſhed ſhe had fired thus oftener, but it could not be done: moreover, it may be obſerved that in their 13th article, in ſaying that the Alliance fired upon the Bon-homme Richard, they ſay out of muſket ſhot, to make it more ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; but in their 21ſt article they ſay within gun ſhot, which imply about gun ſhot diſtance, meaning that the Alliance, when ſhe fired upon the Bon-homme Richard, was at a muſket ſhot diſtance; but if they are compelled to own ſhe fired upon the Serapis, that it was at a gun ſhot diſtance, whence ſhe could do but little damage do the enemy.</p>
            <p>"<hi>Article</hi> 22<hi>d. The morning after the engagement, Capt. Landais ſaid on board the Serapis, as he has ever ſaid ſince, that he raked the Serapis with grape-ſhots, and ſhots, and ſome of them might have ſcattered or touched guns or other iron works that might have made them fly.</hi>"</p>
            <p>"<hi>Article</hi> 23<hi>d. Capt. Landais has ſaid ſeveral times ſince the action, that if the Bon-homme Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard had ſtruck to the Serapis, he would have took them both in the condition and ſituation they were in, and ſay ſo yet.</hi>"</p>

Jones's command; he ſaid the ſame, three different times to Mr. de Cottineau, when that Captain ſpoke to him of Capt. Jones's plan of landing, Capt. Landais orders being only to cruize.</hi>"</p>

            <p>I carried and delivered thoſe written anſwers to his Excellency, and told him I had fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered all the charges laid againſt me, either verbally or in writing, that if there was any new one, or any of the other not completely anſwered, to give them to me in writing; he replied he knew no others.</p>
            <p>His Excellency, after I had read to him and commented upon thoſe anſwers, told me I had better tranſlate them in French, that he might ſhow them to the French Miniſter; but I ſuppoſe he wanted to have them tranſlated to be examined by ſea officers, to try whether nothing could be found therein to be taken hold of againſt me; however, though I had no buſineſs with the French Miniſter, I did it, and carried it to him.</p>
            <p>In preſence of Mr. Le Ray de Chaumont I, being an American officer, begged as a favor and juſtice of his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> to authoriſe me, by his leave and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation in writing, to have the ſketch, relation and certificates, ſigned by all the officers of the Alliance; to be printed in Paris, ſince Capt. Jones's had been printed there; he refuſed to give it me: I told him it was ſurpriſing to me, that he would not grant me my lawful demand, not only for myſelf, but for all the Alliance's crew which was concerned in it; their honour as well as mine having been calumniated by Capt. Jones's falſe relation; which in all appearance had been printed by his authority or conſent, as it was printed to be an extract of a letter from Capt. Jones to Dr. Franklin, which could not be taken out of ſaid letter without his conſent; he declared and aſſured me he knew not by whoſe authority, nor where it was printed, and ſaid Capt. Jones might have had it printed in Holland for all he knew: though I imagined that which he told me was not likely, as I had no proof to the contrary, I ſaid no more about it; but if his Excellency had been a philanthropos, as he is ſaid to be, ſince he had arrogated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with, the power to take the command from a Captain and give it to another, and to judge between them, he would have had the ſketch &amp;c. of the Alliance printed, as the leaſt juſtice that ought to be done to the Alliance's crew, but quite the contrary, and though he wanted to appear a competent and empowered judge, thought he was the ſtrongeſt party againſt the Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance's crew and me.</p>
            <p>The next day after I went occaſionally to Mr. Le Ray de Chaumont, who told me I had puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled his Excellency the day before, about the relation of Capt. Jones, &amp;c. and he added it was not his Excellency that had it printed, but his grandſon had aſked ſeveral times his grandfather to have it printed, and at laſt his Excellency gave it him to be printed: as ſoon as I had made ſome obſervations thereabout, I left Mr. de Chaumont and went directly to his Excellency's, and reminded him how he had declared and aſſured me he knew not by whoſe authority, or where, Capt. Jones's relation had been printed, adding, that I had juſt learned by Mr. Le Ray de Chaumont that his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, Eſq: had himſelf given ſaid relation to his grandſon William Franklin, to be printed, who had it done.

the fact, and ſaid I had miſunderſtood Mr. de Chaumont, or that gentleman was miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; but at that very inſtant, in came Mr. Le Ray de Chaumont, I aſked him whether he had not told me that it was his Excellency's grandſon who had Capt. Jones's relation from his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency's hands, to be printed: his Excellency gave no time to Mr. Chaumont to anſwer; but ſaid it was not his grandſon he had given it to, to have it printed, it was to his nephew, Jonathan Williams; I replied it was the ſame to me, whether he gave it to his nephew or grandſon to be printed, and I told his Excellency, ſince you own it was to your nephew you gave it to be printed, you know then by whoſe authority, and where it was printed, though you declared and aſſured me you did not know either. His Excellency ſaid as an excuſe, that he took particular care in giving it to his nephew, that there was nothing mentioned againſt any body, and that my name was not in it.

I aſked his Excellency whether he remembered I had ſhowed him Congreſs' reſolve, by which I had the command of the Alliance, and therefore I could not be more formally charged before the public, than I was by that relation: his Excellency being put to a nonplus, I continued aſking him, was that your meaning, when you wrote and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to come from Holland to Paris, to juſtify myſelf, "<hi>That I might be ſure to find in your Excellency, every diſpoſition to do that juſtice to my character, which it ſhould appear to merit.</hi>"— And at the ſame time you gave ſuch relation againſt me to be printed in the news-papers, firſt for caluminiating my character, in order after to do that juſtice to my character, which it ſhould then appear to merit by the public. I do not wonder that Capt. Jones told me you had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered him when at l'Orient, to take the command of the Alliance from me; I do not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if he has been ſo baſe as to accuſe me falſely, as he has done, knowing that he would be thus ſupported; I do not wonder now, that out of partiallity, you have taken the Alliance from me, to give her to Capt. Jones; and I do not wonder if you are ſo partial for Capt. Jones, he being ſupported by your grandſon and nephew, and a proper man to ſecond you in ſuch things, as thoſe which have been done againſt my character: his Excellency ſaid not a word: thought I is this the great, the wiſe, the juſt, the deep man, ſo much extolled; he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me all the reverſe.</p>
            <p>I aſked his Excellency to give me an extract of Capt. Jones's letter relating to all he ſaid about the Alliance, certified by him; he told me he had no time do it then, but he would as ſoon as poſſible. I told him, ſince he had detained me in Paris, and had given the command of the Alliance to Capt. Jones, that I begged his Excellency would write him to land my trunks and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them into the American Agent's hands, in Holland: his Excellency would not do it, but wanted me to write to Capt. Jones, which I could not do in thoſe circumſtances; therefore all my things remained on board the Alliance, when ſhe went under Capt. Jones's command from Holland.</p>

                  <p>"In the afternoon (<hi>23</hi>d Auguſt, <hi>1779</hi>) Capt. Landais came on board the Bon-homme Richard, and behaved towards me with great diſreſpect, in the moſt indelicate language and manner, affirming that I had loſt my boats and people, through my imprudence, in ſending boats to take a prize. He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in his reproaches, though he was aſſured by Meſſ'rs de Whichbort and Chamillard, that the barge was actually towing the ſhip at the time of the elopement, and had not been ſent in purſuit of the prize. He was affronted becauſe I would not the day before ſuffer him to chaſe, without my or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and to approach the dangerous ſhore I have already mentioned (Skillocks) where he was an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire ſtranger; and when there was not a ſufficient wind to govern a ſhip. He told me he was the only American in the ſquadron, and was determined to follow his own opinion, in chaſing when and were he thought proper, and in every other matter that concerned the ſervice; and that if I continued three days longer in that ſituation, the ſquadron would be taken, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>"In the afternoon (<hi>31</hi>ſt Auguſt <hi>1779</hi>) another ſail appeared, and I immediately made the ſignal for the Alliance to chace, but inſtead of obeying, he wore and laid the ſhip's head the other way; the next morning I made ſignal to ſpeak with the Alliance, to which no attention was paid.</p>
                  <p>"The next morning (<hi>4</hi>th Sept) having weathered Fair Iſle, and not ſeeing the Vengeance nor the two prizes: I ſpoke the Alliance, and ordered her to ſteer to the northward, bring them up to the rendezvous. On the morning (the <hi>5</hi>th) the Alliance appeared again, and had brought to two very ſmall coaſting ſloops in ballaſt, but without having attended properly to my orders of yeſterday; the Vengeance joined me ſoon after, and informed me, that in conſequence of Capt. Landais orders to the Commanders of the two prizes ſhips, they had refuſed to follow him to the rendezvous. I am this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ignorant what orders theſe men received from Capt. Landais, nor know I by virtue of what authority he ventured to give his orders to prizes in my preſence, and without either my knowledge or approbation.</p>
                  <p>"In the evening I ſent for all the Captains to come on board the Bon-homme Richard, to conſult on future plans of operations; Captains Cottineau and Ricot obeyed me; but Capt. Landais obſtinately refuſed; and after ſending me various uncivil meſſages, wrote me a very extraordinary letter in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to a written order, which I had ſent him on finding that he had trifled with my verbal orders.</p>
                  <p>"When the fleet diſcoverd us bearing down, all the merchants ſhips crouded ſails towards the ſhore; the ſhips of war that protected the fleet, at the ſame time ſteered from the land and made diſpoſition of battle; in approaching the enemy, I crouded every poſſible ſail, and made the ſignal for the line of battle, to which the Alliance ſhowed no attention. Earneſt as I was for the action I could not reach the Commander's ſhip, until ſeven in the evening, being then within piſtol-ſhot, when he hailed the Bon-homme Richard; we anſwered him by firing a whole broadſide. The battle being thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, was continued with unremitting fury. Every method was practiſed on both ſides, to gain an advantage, and rake each other; and I muſt confeſs that the enemy's ſhip being much more mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable than the Bon-homme Richard, gained thereby ſeveral times an advantageous ſituation, in ſpite of my beſt endeavours to prevent it. As I had to deal with an enemy of a greatly ſuperior force, I was under the neceſſity of cloſing with him to prevent the advantage which he had over me in point of manoeuvre. It was my intention to lay the Bon-homme Richard athwart the enemy's bow, but as that operation required great dexterity in the management of both ſails and helm, and ſome of our braces being ſhot away, it did not exactly ſuccced to my wiſh. The enemy's bowſprit, however, came over the Bon-homme Richard's poop, behind the mizenmaſt, and I made both ſhips faſt together in that ſituation, which by the action of the wind on the enemy's ſails, forced her to ſtern cloſe to the Bon-homme

Richard's bow, ſo that the ſhips lay ſquare along ſide of each other, the yards being all entangled and the cannon of each ſhip touching the oppoſite ſide. When this poſition took place, it was near <hi>8</hi> o'clock, previous to which the Bon-homme Richard had received ſundry eighteen pounds-ſhot below the water, and leaked very much; my battery of twelve pounders, on which I placed my chief depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, being commanded by Lieut. Dale and Col. Wirbert, and manned principally by American, ſeamen and French volunteers, was entirely ſilenced and abandoned. As to the old ſix eighteen poun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that formed the battery of the lower deck, they did no ſervice whatever, except firing eight ſhots in all, two out of three of them burſt at the firſt fire, and killed almoſt all the men who were ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to manage them. Before this time too, Col. Chamillard, who commanded a party of twenty ſoldiers, on the poop, had abandoned that ſtation, after having loſt all his men except fiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> I had now two pices of cannon (<hi>9</hi> pounders) on the quarter deck, that were not ſilenced, and not one of the heavier cannon was fired during the remainder of the action. The purſer, Mr. Meaſe, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the guns on the quarter-deck, being dangerouſly wounded in the head, I was obliged to fill his place; and with great difficulty rallied a few men, and ſhifted over one of the lee quarter-deck guns, ſo that we afterwards played three pieces of nine pounders upon the enemy. The tops only ſeconded the fire of this little battery, and held out bravely during the whole of the action eſpecially the maintop, which Lieut. Stack commanded. I directed the fire of one of the three cannons again<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The enemy were, as I have ſince underſtood, on the inſtant of calling for quarter, when the cowardiſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery of three of my under officers, induced them to call to the enemy. The Engliſh Commodore aſked me if I demanded quarters, and I having anſwered him in the moſt determined negative, they renewed the battle with double fury; they were unable to ſtand the deck; but the fire of their cannon, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the lower battery, which was entirely formed of eighteen pounders, was inceſſant. Both ſhips were ſet on fire in various places, and the ſcene was dreadful beyond the reach of language.</p>
                  <p>"To account for the timidity of my three under officers, I mean the Gunner the Carpenter, and the Maſter at Arms: I muſt obſerve that the two firſt were badly wounded; and as the ſhip had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived various ſhot under water, and one of the pumys being ſhot away, expreſſed his fears that ſhe would ſink; whence the two others concluded, that ſhe was ſinking, which occaſioned to run aft the poop, without my knowledge, to ſtrike the colours. Fortunately for me, a cannon-ball had done that long before, by carrying away the enſign: he was therefore reduced to the neceſſity of ſinking, as he ſuppoſed, or of calling for quarters, and he preferred the latter.</p>
                  <p>"All this time the Bon-homme Richard had ſuſtained the action alone, and the enemy though much ſuperior in force, would have been glad to have got clear, as appears from their own acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and by their having let go an anchor, the inſtant I laid them on board, by which means they would have eſcaped, had I not made them well faſt to the Bon-homme Richard: At laſt (at half paſt <hi>9</hi> o'clock) the Alliance appeared, and I now thought the battle at an end, but to my utter aſtoniſhment he diſcharged a broadſide full into the ſtern of the Bon-homme Richard. We called to him for God's ſake to forbear firing into the Bon-homme Richard; yet he paſſed along the off ſide of the ſhip, and continued firing. There was no poſſibility of his miſtaking the en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet for greater ſecurity I ſhowed the ſignal of our recogniſance, by putting out three lanthorns, one at the head, one at the ſtern, and the third in the middle, in a horizontal line.

mortally wounded a good officer on the forecaſtle only. My ſituation was really deplorable; the Bon-homme Richard received various ſhot, under water, from the Alliance; the leak gained on the pumps, and the fire increaſed much aboard both ſhips; ſome officers perſuaded me to ſtrike, of whoſe courage and good ſenſe, I entertain an high opinion. My treacherous Maſter at Arms, let looſe all the priſoners, without my knowledge, and my proſpect became gloomy indeed. The enemy's mainmaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſhake; their firing decreaſed faſt; ours rather increaſed, and the Britiſh colours were ſtruck at half an hour paſt <hi>10</hi> o'clock. This prize proved to be the Britiſh ſhip of war the Serapis, a new ſhip of forty-four guns, built on their moſt approved conſtruction, with two complete batteries, one of them eighteen pounders, and commanded by the brave Commodore Richard Pearſon. The Alliance too was in a ſtate to purſue the fleet, not having had a ſingle man wounded, or a ſingle ſhot fired at her from the Serapis, and only three from the Counteſs of Scarborough, at ſuch diſtance, that one ſtruck in the ſide, and the other juſt touched, and then dropped into the water. The Alliance killed one man only on board the Serapis.</p>
                  <p>"Upon the whole, the Captain of the Alliance has behaved ſo very ill in every reſpect, that I muſt complain loudly of his conduct; he pretends he is authoriſed to act independent of my command; I have been taught the contrary; but ſuppoſing it to be ſo, his conduct has been baſe and unpardonable.</p>

            <p>Although I have fully anſwered the charges laid againſt me in theſe extracts and accuſations, made againſt me; and the four general charges made and propoſed by his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of <hi>diſobedience of orders;</hi> of <hi>having not been to the Bon-homme Richard</hi>'s <hi>aſſiſtance as ſoon as poſſible;</hi> of <hi>having fired upon the Bon-homme Richard, during the engagement;</hi> and of <hi>having not been to take the fleet, the day after the engagement,</hi> which charges his Excellency had made out of Capt. Jones's letters to him, though he had never let me ſee the ſaid extracts, but on the day he ſent them to me; I ſay though I have anſwered them fully, by proving that I was not under Capt. Jones's command, by the orders I had from his Excellency, anſwered all the charges during the engagement, and proved my anſwers by the ſketch, relation, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate, ſigned by all the officers of the Alliance; proved the impoſſibility I was in to go after the Baltic fleet, the day after the engagement; anſwered the twenty-five articles made againſt me; and proved the Alliance did in all reſpects, all ſhe could do, in obedience to his Excellency's order, and the good of the ſervice. I am going for thoſe that are no ſea-officers (for thoſe who are, may ſee through it) to put in a clear light the falſhood hidden in Capt. Jones's letter and relation to his Excellency: the firſt extract begining thus "<hi>In the afternoon</hi> (23<hi>d Auſt.</hi> 1779) <hi>Capt. Landais came on board the Bon-homme Richard, &amp;c.</hi>" is explained page 12 and 13, where it is ſaid, that the Skillocks bore S. E. ½ E. at five miles diſtance, certified by Mr. Varage, and the chaſe N. N. W. therefore there was no danger in chaſing, to go towards the Skillocks, but to the contrary, in chaſing ſhe would have gone further from thoſe rocks, which ſhews it is an evaſion and an impoſition of Capt. Jones's. The ſecond extract beginning thus "<hi>In the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon</hi> (31<hi>ſt Auguſt,</hi> 1779) <hi>another ſail, &amp;c.</hi> is explained (page 31) he does not mention that the Alliance was manning the prize-ſhip Union, and had on board, her own boats and thirty men, which made it impracticable for her to leave them, and chaſe: But Capt. Jones does not ſay that the Bon-homme Richard was there doing nothing, and did not chaſe the ſail in ſight, as ſhe ought to have done. The third extract beginning thus "<hi>The next morning</hi> (4<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h Sept.) having weathered, &amp;c.</hi>" is explained (page 31 and 32) he ſays he is ignorant by what autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:018549_0073_0FA7ADB5067BD210"/>
I ventured to give orders to my prizes, one of which took when the Bon-homme Richard was above fifty leagues diſtance from the Alliance, which he had certainly no right to; the other I had taken when he was three miles off; I may ſay I gave them orders, being authorized to do it by my commiſſion from Congreſs, and by his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, Eſqr's orders to me. The fourth extract beginning thus, "<hi>In the evening I ſent for all the Captains,</hi>" is explained (page 15th) but he does not mention the purport of my extraordinary letter I wrote to him in anſwer to his orders, becauſe therein was hinted the reaſon he had given me (on the 23d Sept.) to never go again on board his ſhip; he does not ſay that he never was willing to ſhow me any voucher to prove I was under his orders, becauſe it was the ſnare laid, wherein to find me guilty, had I obeyed him and broke his Excellency's orders to me, and by the ſame principle he would never give me written order to follow him, though demanded, as certified by Capt. Cottineau, as it would in ſome degree have juſtified me.</p>
            <p>Now I am going to comment on Captain Jones's own relation, of the chaſe and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the 23d September, ſhow his art in writing falſhood and miſrepreſention, and explain the motives I conceived he did it for: to do it clearly, I will take it by paragraphs, and write the firſt and laſt words of each and explain it thus—"<hi>When the fleet diſcovered us, &amp;c."— "The Alliance ſhowed no attention.</hi>"</p>
            <p>If Capt. Jones means, when at half paſt one o'clock, the Alliance ſhowed a ſignal for two ſhips in ſight, and the Bon-homme Richard ſhowed another to chaſe them, he then could not ſee the fleet, which was imbayed cloſe to the land, between Flamborough's and Scarborough's-head, his ſhip being ſouth of Flamborough's-head; Capt. Jones being at ten miles diſtance, could not know what diſpoſition they were making on board the Engliſh men-of-war but by gueſs, he could not mean that they formed the line then, as it was about ſix o'clock when they did it; Capt. Jones, with his peculiar art of diſguiſing the truth, ſays, he crowded "<hi>every poſſible ſail,</hi>" wanting to be underſtood as though he did it as ſoon as the enemies appeared, and do not ſay it was after the Bon-homme Richard had kept cloſe to the wind or brought to, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the pilot ſchooner, until after four o'clock, which firſt blunder and delay gave riſe to all which ſucceeded:—Capt. Jones ſays that he made the ſignal for the line of battle, but do not ſay when, nor what line of battle, by which he proves that he knows words, but do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their meaning, as there are as many different lines upon which a battle may be given as may be imagined, beſides the diſtance from ſhip to ſhip muſt be given likewiſe; therefore if Capt. Jones had made ſuch an inſignificant ſignal, and the Alliance had ſeen it, ſhe could do no more to obey it than ſhe did, for wherever ſhe was, ſhe was upon a line with the Bon-homme Richard: but Capt. Cottineau of the Pallas, which was between the Bon-homme Richard and Alliance (in a letter whereof I will give a copy) ſays, if Capt. Jones made any ſignal, the Alliance could not perceive it in the poſition ſhe was in.</p>
            <p>—"<hi>Earneſt as I was, &amp;c."—"A whole broad-ſide.</hi>"</p>
            <p>If Capt. Jones had been earneſtly willing for the action from the beginning, and had acted in conſequence as he ought to have done, with our combined ſuperiour force, the battle would have been fought and ended during day time, without perhaps the loſs of five men on our ſide, after which we might have been in a condition to take and deſtroy the whole fleet of merchants veſſels: by the watches of Capt. Spencer and mine, the engagement, or rather the firſt gun fired, was at 8 minutes paſt eight o'clock, and by Capt. Cottineau's it was four minutes paſt eight; but Capt. Jones wants to make it appear it began ſooner for his own purpoſes: if Capt. Jones fired then his whole broad-ſide, he loſt by it his ſhots, as coming head long, as he did, upon the Serapis's broad-ſide, he could not point his guns to any effect, but his two forecaſtle chaſe
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:018549_0074_0FA7ADB5D90B25E8"/>
ones, and the Serapis had received during the engagement, but five ſhots on her larboard ſide.</p>
            <p>—"<hi>The battle being thus began, &amp;c."—"Endeavours to prevent it.</hi>"</p>
            <p>It appears that the Serapis, taking advantage of the awkwardneſs of the Bon-homme Richard in coming upon her, began and continued with <hi>unremitting</hi> fury; but on board the Bon-homme Richard, I ſuppoſe, without pretending to blame her crew, there was unremitting fear, owing to their leader's bad attack. Capt. Pearſon's method was by far better practiſed than Capt. Jones's for raking his enemy: Capt. Jones ſhould have ſaid the enemy's ſhip, being much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter managed than the Bon-homme Richard (though ſhe alſo had a helm, braces, and bowlines as well as the other, of which I made no uſe) gained thereby ſeveral times an advantageous ſituation, in ſpite of my beſt endeavours to prevent it, and defeated me by her three firſt broad-ſides: he would have owned the truth clearly in that particular; but though he don't ſay ſo directly, it may be underſtood by that, which he ſaid conſidering that he wrote it.</p>
            <p>—"<hi>As I had to deal, &amp;c."—"To my wiſh.</hi>"</p>
            <p>The Bon-homme Richard could fight with ſix eighteen pounders on her lower deck, fourteen twelves upon her upper deck, five eights upon her quarter-deck and forecaſtle, all French me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, on one ſide; had three hundred and ſeventy-five men going out of l'Orient, and twelve which were enliſted out of the prizes men, which make in all three hundred and eighty-ſeven, out of which number to be deducted five-and-twenty men that ran away from her to Ireland, there then remains three hundred and ſixty-two.—The Serapis had ten eighteen pounders on her lower deck, ten nines upon her upper deck, and four ſixes on the quarter-deck and forecaſtle, all Engliſh metal, which ſhe could fight with on one ſide, had two hundred and eighty-eight men in all, out of which eight Eaſt-India men which would not fight, remains two hundred and eighty; in conſeqence the Bon-hommme Richard could ſend every broadſide on the enemy, three hundred and ſixteen pounds of ſhots, French metal; the Serapis could, return but two hundred and eighty-four, Engliſh metal; if with this difference in metal, the Bon-homme Richard could ſhoot in one broad-ſide is combined eighty two fighting men, ſhe had more than the Serapis, the moment of the Bon-homme Richard's whole force compared to the Serapis's whole one, will be :: 5 : 2; if the thickneſs and ſtoutneſs of the Bon-homme Richard, her height of quarter-deck, forecaſtle and tops, above thoſe of the Serapis, are conſidered as advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous as they were in their poſition, it will prove the Bon-homme Richard was really double the force of the Serapis, and will prove again, that Capt. Jones was wrong in ſaying he had to deal with a ſuperior force.—Capt. Jones pretends to aſcribe to his dexterity, the event of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Bon-homme Richard athwart the enemy's bow, which happened only by his ſecond blunder in attacking the enemy, and it was impoſſible in the ſituation he was in, after having received the firſt broad-ſide, to do it otherwiſe, as the Bon-homme Richard, when coming down head-long upon the enemy's broad-ſide, had the Quarter-Maſter at the helm wheel killed (I have heard ſay) and the Bon-homme Richard, of itſelf, ran before the wind perpendicularly againſt the Serapis's larboard main ſhrowds, which by their reſiſtance and oppoſition firſt ſtuped, and after by their elaſticity and re-action, made the Bon-homme Richard go ſomewhat aſtern, at the ſame time the Serapis's ſtern, by the impulſion ſhe had received in her main ſhrowds, falled leeward, and of courſe her head came in the wind; the wind being then on her top-ſails made her go aſtern, by that time the Bon-homme Richard, who had been puſhed back, was ſoon ſtopped, having the wind off, which made her go ahead, and paſs before the Serapis, who had been aſtern enough to let her, but the Serapis having made her falling, going ahead, ran her bowſprit in the Bon-homme Richard's ſtarboard mizen ſhrowds, (ſee the tenth poſition) what proves it was accidental, and not deſigned by Capt. Jones, is, that the Bon-homme Richard in that advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:018549_0075_0FA7ADB679034E70"/>
poſition, did not fire a ſingle gun to rake the Serapis, which would not have been omitted had it been foreſeen.</p>
            <p>—"<hi>The enemy's bowſprit, &amp;c."—"All his men except five.</hi>"—</p>
            <p>The queſtion might properly be made to Capt. Jones, what could induce him to leave his command and poſt on the quarter-deck, to go upon the poop and make faſt himſelf the Serapis's bowſprit to his ſhip, at a time when all his crew had fled from their quarters, ſince they had not fired a gun in that advantageous poſition, which Capt. Jones owns himſelf in the latter part of the paragraph; another queſtion to the ſame purport might be put to him, which is, whether the crew had abandoned him, ſo that he had not a ſingle man left to ſend to make faſt the Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis's bowſprit to his ſhip, or not? if he ſays he had, why did he leave his command and poſt at ſuch a critical time to do it himſelf? If he ſays he had not, what reaſon can he give for making faſt the Serapis's bowſprit to his ſhip, when he had not a ſingle man left to obey him or defend her, whilſt the Serapis's crew encouraged by the confidence, well deſerved, they had for their leader, their firſt ſucceſs, and the Bon-homme Richard's firing being ſilenced, kept their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and fired with unremitting fury? he could certainly make no anſwer that could juſtify his boaſted action of making faſt the two ſhips together; but here is my opinion of the motive, which I leave the reader to judge, that induced Capt. Jones to make faſt the two ſhips together himſelf, as he could have no other (ſee the tenth poſition) he ſeeing that the Serapis having not yet fired a gun from her ſtarboard ſide batteries, had them all ready to fire as ſoon as the bow of one ſhip ſhould come againſt the ſtern of the other, as in the eleventh poſition, which was unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; fearing that he ſhould fall by that broad-ſide, had he ſtood at his poſt on the quarter-deck, he went upon the poop, where none of the Serapis's batteries guns could be pointed under her own bowſprit, and where the tops were prevented from firing by the top-ſails bunts, therefore Capt. Jones was there very ſafe from any danger in that dreadful moment; but there were ſeveral wounded volunteers lying on the poop, who might have obſerved his retreat there and revealed it, to prevent which, he made the enemies bowſprit faſt to his ſhip, for an excuſe of his being there.—Capt. Jones ſays it was near eight o'clock when the two ſhips lay ſquare along ſide each other, and had their yards entangled together; but he ſays previous to that (which muſt be a very ſhort time after the engagement began) his ſhip had received ſundry eighteen pound ſhots, and leaked very much (by and by he will ſay, as is already ſaid in the 19th arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, that thoſe ſhots and others ſhe had received from the Serapis, during the reſt of the engagement were fired by the Alliance) and he adds that his battery of twelve pounders was entirely ſilenced and abandoned then (how could he ſay in the accuſations he made againſt me, ſigned by his abettors, that Capt. Landais, which he ſays, came after nine o'clock, article 13th, raked the Bon-homme Richard, killed a number of men, diſmounted ſundry guns, and ſilenced all the twelve pounders? this paragraph proves evidently his and abettors impoſition as well as the reſt) moreover, he owns that his lower battery was then likewiſe abandoned, as well as his poop, where fifteen men had been killed out of twenty; therefore it proves conſpicuouſly that his ſhip was totally abandoned ſoon after the engrgement began, that ſhe was not in a condition to be faſtened with the enemy, and that Capt. Jones and his abettors were wrong in charging the Alliance of all the diſaſters the Bon-homme Richard had ſuffered by her leader's fault from the Serapis's fire.</p>
            <p>—'<hi>I had now two pieces, &amp;c."—"At laſt effected.</hi>"</p>
            <p>Capt. Jones owns that no other cannon was fired from his ſhip, during the remainder of the action, but three nine pounders on the quarter-deck, "<hi>that with great difficulty he rallied a few men.</hi>" Certainly that part of his ſhip was alſo abandoned,—He ſays, "<hi>Mr. Maze being
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:018549_0076_0FA7ADB7362A0EF0"/>
wounded, he was obliged to fill his place.</hi>" This was wrong again of Capt. Jones, in ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, not to try to rally more men, and leave his command on the middle of the quarter-deck, and go himſelf to load or point a cannon during the reſt of the action, as he did, when he could certainly ſend an officer to force a man to come and replace Mr. Meaze; but it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears he preferred that new poſt, where he was covered by the ſhip's ſide or breaſtwork (being impoſſible for the enemy to point any cannon there) to his real poſt on the middle of the quarter-deck, where he would have been in danger of being fired at from the Serapis's tops. He ſays, "<hi>That he directed the fire of one of thoſe three cannon againſt the main-maſt of the enemy.</hi>"— He does not tell the true reaſon why, but is moſt likely he wanted to clear his ſhip, which he could not do but by ſhooting away the Serapis's main-maſt, which was entangled with his; this ſhows that though he had his little battery more then, than when he had made the two ſhips faſt together, he wanted to go away, which proves he made them faſt together for an excuſe of his going upon the poop, and alſo it proves he knew, and took, the places where there was no danger.</p>
            <p>—"<hi>The enemies were, &amp;c."—"Reach of language.</hi>"</p>
            <p>Suppoſing that Capt. Jones had really cleared the enemy's quarter-deck, and ſilenced his muſketry there, as he pretends to perſuade the public (which is totally diſowned by Captain Pearſon's relation) he is more guilty than a common impoſter to invent, that the enemy were on the inſtant to call out for quarters, when on their lower and upper deck they had not yet had a ſingle man even wounded by the Bon-homme Richard's fire, and where ſhe could not wound one with her three quarter-deck guns, which were ſo high above the quarter-deck of the enemy, that it was impoſſible to point them low enough to ſhoot even in the quarter-deck planks; he dares not only refuſe the eulogium due to the notorious good conduct of Capt. Pearſon, but charges him of his willingneſs to call for quarters, when he was certain to ſink at laſt the Bon-homme Richard with her two batteries, had ſhe not been aſſiſted: all which ſhows his only principle was to hide his faults, charge them upon others, and appear a hero (at leaſt upon paper) to thoſe that could not underſtand thoroughly his relation.</p>
            <p>—"<hi>To account for the timidity, &amp;c."—"Preferred to the latter.</hi>"</p>
            <p>This paragraph proves that the Bon-homme Richard was very leaky by the various ſhots ſhe had received under water from the Serapis, even at that time: and had Capt. Jones been at his poſt on the middle of the quarter-deck, it would have prevented thoſe three men who did not ſee any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander left whatever, to call to the enemies for quarters, and go upon the poop to ſtrike the colours.</p>
            <p>—"<hi>All this time, &amp;c."—"Well faſt to the Bon-homme Richard.</hi>"</p>
            <p>Capt. Jones repreſents Capt. Pearſon as a coward, ſaying falſely that his ſhip was ſuperior in force to the Bon-homme Richard, though the latter had been almoſt totally diſabled, and was nigh ſinking by the three firſt broad-ſides ſhe had received from the Serapis, which Capt. Jones ſays then, "<hi>would have been glad to have gone clear, as appears by their own acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>" This is fully diſowned in Capt. Pearſon's relation, as well as by all the verbal decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations I have heard by his officers; and he gives as proof thereof, that the Serapis "<hi>let go an anchor the inſtant the Bon-homme Richard hung by her mizen-ſhrowds, to the Serapis's gib-boom, and Capt. Jones made theſe two ſhips faſt together.</hi>" Though Captain Pearſon can never be too much praiſed for his preſence of mind in that particular inſtance, conſidering that the ſmall S. W. wind which blew then was decreaſing very faſt from the time of the beginning of the chaſe, and to ſuch a degree, that a quarter of an hour after the engagement was over, it was quite calm until ſix the next morning, that the current then until midnight, ran at the rate of more than two knots and an half from north to ſouth, and that the Alliance, Pallas, and Counteſs
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:018549_0077_0FA7ADB80056C6D8"/>
of Scarborough were ſouthward of the Bon-homme Richard and Serapis, whence if it had calmed a little ſooner, or the Alliance had not ſailed in a light wind and ſmooth ſea, as ſhe did, it would have been impoſſible for her to go to the aſſiſtance of the Bon-homme Richard, which muſt have been taken, by being faſtened along ſide the Serapis, being at anchor: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Capt. Jones, in this paragraph, as in all others, is wrong in impeaching the brave Capt. Pearſon, inſtead of giving the praiſe due to his ſkill, and raiſing his own fallacious glory.</p>
            <p>—"<hi>At laſt (at half paſt nine o'clock) &amp;c."—"And continued firing.</hi>"</p>
            <p>Capt. Jones hinted the engagement began at ſeven o'clock, and ſays in this paragraph the Alliance appeared only at half paſt nine, which is two hours and an half after: but in the 13th article of the charges he made againſt me, and had ſigned by his abettors, he ſays, "<hi>That after the Bon-homme Richard and Serapis were made faſt along ſide of each other (which was not done until an hour after the engagement begun) Capt. Landais out of muſket ſhot raked the Bon-homme Richard, &amp;c.</hi>" which implies it was about an hour after the begining of the engagement, that the Alliance raked (he ſays) the Bon-homme Richard, which makes an hour and an half difference that there is between the time mentioned in ſaid charges ſigned by his abettors, and this charge in his relation, for the time the Alliance appeared, which is enough to prove that he was wrong in his articles, or relation of accuſations: moreover, both are wrong, as it was not above thirty-five minutes after the beginning of the engagement when the Alliance raked the Serapis from ſtern to head: but Capt. Jones's miſrepreſentation as to time, is not the only ſtriking ones in this paragraph, as he ſays, "<hi>But to my utter aſtoniſhment he diſcharged</hi> (ſpeaking of me) <hi>a broad-ſide full into the ſtern of the Bon-homme Richard, yet paſſed along the off ſide of the ſhip and continued firing.</hi>"—Any impartial man who was in that engagement, or had ſeen the ſketch and relation, ſigned by all the officers of the Alliance, would be apt to think that Capt. Jones was not there, or had loſt all his natural ſenſe or remembrance, when he wrote his relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in making ſuch charges againſt me: there is no further need of proving the falſhood of it, but by looking at the eleventh poſition of the ſketch, to ſee that the Alliance, after having raked the firſt time the Serapis full in her ſtern by a broad-ſide, fired no more then, but paſſed before the head of the Bon-homme Richard, as they were head againſt ſtern; conſequently, it was impoſſible to rake the Bon-homme Richard in her ſtern, after which the Alliance turned her ſtern to the Bon-homme Richard's bow, as may b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſeen by the dotes in the ſketch, to mark her way, and went directly towards the Counteſs of Scarborough, far from paſſing along ſide of his ſhip, as he awkwardly ſays, by which he proves that he does not leave the appearance of a poſſibility in his falſe accuſations.</p>
            <p>—"<hi>There was no poſſibility of his miſtaking, &amp;c"—"On the forecaſtle only.</hi>"</p>
            <p>There was no poſſibility of any on board the Alliance to miſtake one ſhip for another, which is certified by all the officers of the Alliance, and that ſhe raked effectually, at three different times, the Serapis, without any miſtake whatever: but Capt. Jones peremptorily and preciſely affirms, "<hi>That by one of my vollies, I killed eleven of his beſt men, and mortally wounded a good officer on the forecaſtle only.</hi>" How can Capt. Jones affirm any ſuch thing ſo particularly and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, as to tell the number and quality of men killed, and mention an officer mortally wounded on the forecaſtle only by the Alliance, without telling his name to have it known? it muſt be all a myſtery to every body, even to Capt. Jones, if the ghoſt of thoſe eleven of his beſt men did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear and tell him they were killed by the Alliance: and Capt. Jones might then have croſs-queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned them, to know the truth, aſking them how they could remain unhurt upon the forecaſtle, when raked from head to ſtern; where all the Serapis's ſhots paſſed firſt, and deſtroyed every thing in their way, going upon the poop, where they deſtroyed fifteen volunteers out of twenty,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:018549_0078_0FA7ADB8B2171AD8"/>
and made the reſt, with their officer, leave that quarter. The ghoſt muſt have recourſe to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural cauſes, as their only play, for their preſervation there then, to aſſert their depoſition, or be proved liars. But ſuppoſe they made uſe of that play, and convinced thus Capt. Jones; another might be put to him, which is, why did he leave expoſed, from head to toes, eleven of his beſt men, and a good officer, doing nothing whatever, upon the forecaſtle, in an unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able danger, under the Serapis's tops and quarter-deck muſketeers, which was cloſe to, and predominated the Bon-homme Richard's forecaſtle, and not ſend nor call for one, at leaſt, of thoſe men, to replace him in loading and pointing the quarter-deck guns, that he might have reſumed his command? his anſwer muſt be that he preferred his new poſt to the command of his ſhip, and wanted to have thoſe men killed by the Serapis, or muſt own there was none, as real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there could be none alive. But Capt Jones, to cover the true cauſe, thought expedient to charge me thus, with his mens lives, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e had loſt by his own fault.</p>
            <p>—"<hi>My ſituation was really deplorable."—"Gloomy indeed.</hi>"</p>
            <p>I conceive that Capt. Jones's ſituation was deplorable even in his ſecond ſituation, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from the beginning, to be ſunk, or ſtrike to the enemy, which would have carried him to England, where he could expect nothing but a ſad reception, which made him hold on until the Alliance effected his deliverence out of thoſe dangers, and the reduction of the enemy: but he ſays, "<hi>That the Bon-homme Richard received various ſhots under water from the Alliance, and the fire increaſed much on board both ſhips.</hi>" He does not remember, that he ſaid before eight o'clock the Bon-homme Richard had received ſundry eighteen pound ſhot below the water, and leaked very much, and ſince that time, the inceſſant fire of the Serapis's lower battery, could by no means ſtop theſe leaks, but rather increaſed them, and naturally the water coming in the ſhip all the time, and no body to pump it out, muſt neceſſarily gain, without any other cauſe; and his charging the Alliance of having fired ſeveral ſhots under water of the Bon-homme Richard, is like all the other damages he received by his own faults, from the Serapis.</p>
            <p>—"<hi>The enemy's main-maſt began to ſhake, &amp;c."—"Richard Pearſon.</hi>"</p>
            <p>Every one muſt wonder and admire, what a ſudden and happy change befel Captain Jones, when under ſuch a gloomy proſpect; and thoſe that believe his relation, all along, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in this paragraph, muſt neceſſarily acknowledge, firſt his holineſs to credit it and aſcribe ſaid change to a miracle wrought in his favor, for he ſaid before eight o'clock his two decks battery and poop were abandoned, that his ſhip was very leaky, &amp;c. &amp;c. that ſince that time he had ſuffered an inceſſant fire of the Serapis's two batteries; that he had nothing left but three quarter-deck guns (which could not point to the Serapis's hulk, or any man contained in it) that beſides the Alliance came, and gave a full broad-ſide into the Bon-homme Richard, and paſſed along ſide and continued firing (and after he ſays) he paſſed round firing into the Bon-homme Richard's head, ſtern, and broad-ſide, and by one of his volies killed eleven of my beſt men, and wounded a good officer, on the forecaſtle only. The Bon-homme Richard received various ſhot under water from the Alliance: for all that, all at once he ſays, the enemy's main-maſt began to ſhake, their firing decreaſed faſt, ours rather increaſed, and the Britiſh colours were ſtruck, at half paſt ten o'clock. Miracles are unſpeakable!—But thoſe that will not believe, blindly will find the natural cauſes of this change in Captain Jones's proſpect, contained in the ſketch, relation, and certificates, ſigned by all the officers of the Alliance, and in the relation of Captain Pearſon, to the Britiſh admiralty, which will prove the whole relation of Captain Jones, is compounded of miſrepreſentations, of falſe imputations artfully contrived againſt the Alliance, tending to this paragraph, to extol himſelf above hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, and charge me, as Captain of the Alliance, of all he could imagine, to cover his
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:018549_0079_0FA7ADBCD5084AE8"/>
inability and miſconduct (by which he had his ſhip and crew almoſt all deſtroyed) to make me appear worſe than any man extant. And thoſe that ſcrutinize and examine the poſſibility, or impoſſibility of things, after having peruſed Capt. Jones's relation, in which he owns his ſhip and crew were almoſt deſtroyed, from the begining of the engagement, and all the engagement long by the Serapis, his ſaying, that in addition the Alliance deſtroyed his ſhip and crew almoſt a ſecond time, and as if by being deſtroyed by her, it had rouſed the courage of his men left at his little battery; dejected and caſt down all the Serapis's crew; he ſays that their fire decreaſed faſt, that his rather increaſed, without giving any reaſon why, the Britiſh colours were ſtruck; I leave to judge the probality thereof, and what Capt. Jones is capable of.</p>
            <p>—"<hi>The Alliance &amp;c."—'On board the Serapis.</hi>"</p>
            <p>I have already anſwered heretofore, all this paragraph, but the laſt phraſe that "<hi>the Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance killed one man only on board the Serapis.</hi>" How is it poſſible that Capt. Jones can aſſert that the Alliance killed one man, and no other than one man, on board the Serapis; when Capt. Pearſon ſays, ſhe killed or wounded almoſt all his men on the quarter-deck and decks, which was the common report, likewiſe, of all his remaining officers; but it is in reſpect to this as the reſt of his relation.</p>
            <p>—"<hi>Upon the whole, &amp;c.—'unpardonable.</hi>"</p>
            <p>I will make but one obſervation in this laſt paragraph, as all the reſt is nothing but inſults, from a man that knows how to avoid giving any ſatisfaction for them. He ſays, ſpeaking of the Captain of the Alliance, "<hi>he pretends that he is authorized to act independent of my command, I have been taught the contrary.</hi> He does not ſay that he had any orders either from his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency Benjamin Franklin, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> or any other by which I was really under his command, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he would have inſiſted.</p>
            <p>I am afraid that I have been too prolix upon ſuch a ſubject for ſagacious readers, who may at once ſee through Capt. Jones's relation and views, but I thought it neceſſary for thoſe that truſt more to others judgment than to their own, who when they ſee any thing printed in a news<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paper, believe it as being authentic, without daring to examine the propriety of it; and I muſt confeſs that I never wondered at Capt. Jones's writing ſuch relation as his to his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> but I always ſince did, do, and ever ſhall, wonder how any impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial reader could believe it.</p>
            <p>I expatiated verbally upon Capt. Jones's relation, before his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> to prove to him the impoſition contained therein, but all in vain; nothing could avail with him, though his Excellency could not give a reaſon why he had taken the command of the Alliance from me, to give it to Capt. Jones.</p>
            <p>Here follow pieces which will ſerve to deſtroy ſome of the 25 articles made by Capt. Jones, and ſigned by his abettors, and thoſe by himſelf, made againſt me, and will bring the truth to light, viz.</p>

            <p>As it is proved heretofore and after, that on board the Bon-homme Richard, they commonly made ſignals in places where they could not be perceived, they omitted to make neceſſary ones; and in the firſt article above-mentioned, they did not anſwer the cutter Cerf's ſignal, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that Capt. Jones was guilty of the charge laid againſt me in his fifth article.</p>
            <p>The ſecond article above proves the reaſon Capt. Jones gives for having prevented the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance from chaſing on the 23d Auguſt (by which he had five-and-twenty of his men run away in two boats) to be falſe, ſaying it was to prevent the Alliance from approaching the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſhore mentioned (Skillocks) which, according to Mr. Varage, bore S. E. ½ S. at five miles diſtance; and by the Alliance's logg-book, the veſſel chaſed, bore then N. N. W. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the Alliance had continued the chaſe, ſhe would have been in no danger of approaching the Skillocks, but to the contrary, ſhe would have gone further and further from it. It may be obſerved alſo that Capt Jones had ſaid to Mr. Varage, there was no danger in going cloſe to the Skillocks; but to juſtify his preventing the Alliance chaſing, by which he loſt his men and boats; he contradicts himſelf, in ſaying it was very dangerous.</p>
            <p>By Mr. Varage's third article, it appears that Capt. Jones declared to him that his boats had run away juſt after they came from taking the prizes: but Capt. Jones pretends in his own firſt

                  <p>"Article <hi>14</hi>th. The Alliance bore away an hour after the engagement began, or thereabout, on the Pallas and Counteſs of Scarborough, at the inſtant ſhe ſtruck, at ſix or ſeven hundred fathoms diſtance from the Bon-homme Richard and Serapis (in the opinion of Capt. Cottineau.) Capt. Landais hailed the Pallas and Counteſs of Scarborough (which had then ſtruck) but Capt. Cottineau could not hear what he ſaid, and directly Capt.

            <p>Capt. Cottineau's fourth, ninth, and twenty-fourth articles, corroborate with that, which I ſaid there about, that I would not break his Excellency's orders to me, in following Capt. Jones, unleſs he would ſend me written orders therefor: and that when the Bon-homme Richard and Vengeance appeared in the night to us, and Capt. Cottineau, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing they would have proved enemies, aſked me what I ſhould do if the ſhip proved to be a ſixty guns: that I anſwered, if ſhe was above fifty, we had nothing better to do than to make the beſt of our way to avoid them. In his eleventh he is miſtaken, as to the diſtance, which he could not aſcertain, in the night, and being in the wind's eye, the Counteſs of Scarborough, right leeward of the Alliance, in the beginning, and before the engagement: it is explained in the Alliance's officers relation, which were in a better poſition to judge it. In his twelfth, he gives the reaſon why the Alliance could not engage the Counteſs of Scarborough cloſer, becauſe, if ſhe had bore on her to do it, ſhe could not have fetched after, on the ſame tack, the Bon-homme Richard and Serapis: he explains likewiſe, that the Alliance remained windward, relatively to the Pallas, who bore before the wind. In the 24th he owns the Alliance bore upon him about an hour after the engagement began; but as ſhe had bore away, firſt to go and rake the
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:018549_0083_0FA7ADBF72BB5DA0"/>
Serapis (which took about a quarter of an hour's time to perform) it was then at moſt three quarters of an hour after the engagement began. Capt. Cottineau muſt be miſtaken again, owing to the ſmoke or ſomething elſe, as to the diſtance, he thinks he was then leeward of the Bon-homme Richard; for it ſhould have been impoſſible for the Alliance to gain ſix hundred fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms in the wind's eye, by ſuch weather, to run two other tacks, tack about twice and bear away twice in that ſpace of time, remaining until ſeventeen minutes paſt ten o'clock. It muſt be obſerved, by the by, that Capt. Cottineau owns that the Counteſs of Scarborough received ſeveral ſhots in her larboard ſide (three of which at her water line were plugged) he would not ſay they were ſent from the Alliance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though no other engaged her on that ſide, he always took care to ſay, the Alliance was at a greater diſtance when ſhe fired, than ſhe really was, fearing to diminiſh his glory.</p>
            <p>I was upon very indifferent terms with Mr. Cottineau, he being affronted becauſe, during the engagement, I had told him to make more ſail and go to engage the Counteſs of Scarborough, whilſt I would go to the aſſiſtance of the Bon-homme Richard, as mentioned in the Alliance's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p>Here follows another piece from Capt. Cottineau, wrote and ſent to Mr. Le Ray de Chaumont, who ſhowed it to Mr. de Sartine, the French Miniſter, and his Excellency B. Franklin, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> had it in his hands during three days to conſider, viz.</p>

                  <p>"The ſaid Mr. Cottineau diſapproved Capt. Jones's conduct, for remaining three weeks off Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to burn Colier's veſſels, rather than to go off Cape Muis, where he was ordered to cruize, warning him, that when one don't follow the orders he has, nothing but a complete ſucceſs can juſtify him.</p>
                  <p>"The ſaid Capt. Jones has baſely and falſely charged Mr. Ricot, Captain of the Vengeance: he has likewiſe overcharged Capt. Landais with a number of complaints againſt him.</p>
                  <p>"The ſaid Capt. Jones is at moſt capable of commanding a ſmall privateer; one may judge it by the relation he has given about the engagement on Sept. <hi>23</hi>d, againſt the Sarapis and the Counteſs of Scarborough; wherein he ſays, he made the ſignal for the line of battle, which cannot be formed but in conſequence of the enemy's poſition, then there is no ſuch line determined, therefore ſaid Capt. Jones proves his incapacity.</p>
                  <p>"That engagement ſo famous, would have been leſs ſucceſsful, if the Frigate Alliance had not raked twice the Serapis, and by that manoeuvre had not deſtroyed <hi>35</hi> of her men; and Capt. Jones is wrong in ſaying that the Alliance was a ſecond enemy againſt him.</p>
                  <p>"The ſaid Capt. Jones has miſrepreſented the circumſtances, in ſpeaking of chaſing the Baltic fleet, that fleet was four leagues windward, and cloſe to the land when the engagement began; after which there was a very thick fog that made the purſuit after the fleet impracticable; and moreover, Capt. Jones never made a ſignal therefor; that is not the only thing he did forget, as during the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, he forgot that his ſhip had a rudder and ſails, ſince he made no uſe of either whatever; his only occupation then was to cry out fire, and to point himſelf a cannon, by which neglect he left the Serapis to rake him three different times, which killed, by that awkwardneſs, at leaſt <hi>40</hi> of his men.</p>
                  <p>"If Capt. Jones, rather than go to the two Figates, which were going from the land, had chaſed the fleet, we would have come near, and the action would have been nigh it, and we might have joined it after the reduction of the two Frigates.</p>

When I arrived from Holland I expected ſome juſtice would be done, and I would be ſent back to take the command of the Alliance, with the deſerved glory of having, by my conduct in the engagement of Sept. <hi>23</hi>d laſt, not only prevented the Bon-homme Richard to be taken by the Serapis, but alſo reduced and made that laſt ſhip ſtrike; and that the malignant ſhould be puniſhed for having calumniated me! but it has been quite the contrary: to what is it owing to that the command of the Alliance has been taken from me, &amp;c? When I departed from the Texel for Paris, according to your order, I brought with me only the neceſſary papers for my juſtification, and few cloaths, leaving on board the Frigate four trunks, containing my cloaths, books, ſea-charts, mathematics, optics and aſtronomic inſtruments, all the ſhip's papers and my own private ones: as I muſt go to America to crave juſtice and ſince I cannot go prudently there without the moſt neceſſary of thoſe things, I hope you will procure me the money to buy them, having been deprived of thoſe I had by following your orders; beſides, I want ſome money for my daily expences.</p>

                  <p>"I am perſuaded Sir, that you have not been leſs affected than me for the loſs of the great number of French volunteers who were killed in the engagement of the Bon-homme Richard againſt the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapis.

The Captain of that Frigate having kept a conduct very extraordinary, I don't doubt, Sir, but you will call him near you to give an account thereof, and in caſe you ſhould find that it is by his fault the victory coſt ſo much blood, you will judge proper to acquaint Congreſs thereof, in order that they may have that Captain blotted out of their navy officers liſt.</p>

            <p>Suppoſing that letter was wrote to his Excellency, on that date, by the French Miniſter, who being miſinformed on that account, not knowing the truth then, he was right, in ſome reſpects, to recommend to his Excellency an inquiry, in order to know whether I was really faulty or not, but he was wrong in dictating an arbitrary act to his Excellency, who being the repreſentative in France of a nation, which was contending for their freedom, in which conteſt that nation was ſupported by France; and his Excellency ſhould not have, againſt the principle that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion contended for, tyrannically put his leſſon in execution without my being ſent to America to be tried by a Court-martial, before I ſhould be blotted out of Congreſs officers liſt: but his Excellency did not ſtop to the arbitrary dictate of Mr. de Sartine, which was conditional, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in caſe I had been found faulty, his Excellency, without Congreſs's order or aſſent, out of of his own will, againſt a great many authentic proofs, corroborating one with the others, my dutifulneſs and good conduct, and Capt. Jones's bad conduct in general, and particularly for the loſs of thoſe French volunteers, he tyrannically took the command of the Alliance from me, to give it to Capt. Jones.</p>
            <p>Moreover it may be obſerved by the by, that the French Miniſter, did not even dictate the lawful courſe, he was to follow himſelf for the officers of the French Navy, in ſimilar caſe, which is to ſend the faulty one to his own nation, to be tried there, by a Court-martial, and be condemned therefor: but dictated his Excellency, to write to Congreſs, in order that they ſhould blot me out of their ſea-officers liſt, without further puniſhment, as if he had nothing in view but to have me out of the American navy.</p>
            <p>Another obſervation to be noticed in that French Miniſter's letter is that, in ſpeaking of the ſhip Alliance, he calls her an American Frigate, which, in French, imply a King or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public ſhip from 20 to 60 guns: but ſpeaking of the Bon-homme Richard, he don't ſay ſhe was a French or American Frigate, or a French one in the American ſervice, which he could not have omitted had ſhe been either of the three. This particular, that ſhe was neither, but that ſhe was a privateer, appears to me fully corroborating with the extract of his Excellency's letter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in anſwer to Commodore Gillon, who had acquainted him of the Engliſh deſign (which they effected) to go and take Charleſtown, in South-Carolina, and who aſked for the command of the American fleet, compoſed of the Bon-homme Richard, Alliance, Pallas, &amp;c. in order to go and releaſe, or defend that city, viz.</p>

            <p>Which above letter from his Excellency coincides with the French Miniſter's, to prove that the Bon-homme Richard, &amp;c. was not a King's nor United States' ſhip, nor a King's ſhip in the United States' ſervice, but that ſhe was a privateer belonging to the concerned, as expreſſed in his Excellency's letter, who would not have made uſe of that derogatory mercantile deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination for man-of-war, inſtead of allied powers: another proof thereof is, that Capt. Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineau told me he was concerned in the Pallas for the ſum of eighty thouſand livres, and the Vengeance was Mr. Le Ray de Chaumont's property: that the Bon-homme Richard was not reſitted for the ſecond cruize, as the King's ſhips are, by the direction of the Commander and Intendant of the harbour; and any ſtores ſhe wanted out of the King's yard ſhe could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>u without Mr. Gowrlade (Mr. Le Ray de Chaumont's correſpondent) had given in writing that he was bound for the payment thereof, and that Capt. Jones had no French commiſſion ſince being in the Texel, where he could ſtay no longer by the winter ſeaſon coming; a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from the King was ſent him there (for the cruize only) in caſe he ſhould be compelled to go to Denmark or Sweden, to be received there.</p>
            <p>But to acquaint the reader how I have heard (which I relate only as hear-ſay) that Capt. Jones became Captain of the Bon-homme Richard; that he had obtained from Congreſs, by the Hon. Robert Morris's influence, a commiſſion of Captain of one of their ſchooners; after he was ſent in the Ranger ſloop of war to France, where he tyrannically uſed both his officers and ſeamen, particularly his Firſt-Lieutenant, Mr. Simpſon (of Portſmouth in Hampſhire) which he had confined at Breſt in a common priſon, where were the common French ſeamen uſually impriſoned for ſome crimes or others, during twenty-odd days, &amp;c. at which treatment to Lieut. Simpſon the other officers and crew were ſo incenſed againſt Capt Jones that they found means to drive him and Capt. Parke, his favourite, out of that ſhip, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of her was given to Lieut. Simpſon, who brought her to America. Capt. Jones having no proſpect then left to come ſafely and be employed there, as he had reaſon to think Lieut. Simp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's countrymen would ſhow him their diſatisfaction for having uſed that officer as he had; but he had ſomebody or other to ſpeak in his favour to Mr. de Sartine; beſides, his Excellency, who has ſhown ſo much partiality in Capt. Jones's favour, and to whom he might have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by his intimate friend, the Hon. Robert Morris, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> ſpoke, very likely, a word in his behalf to Mr. de Sartine, who wrote a letter either to his Excellency or to Capt. Jones, that he would procure him, ſome employment; but by the indiſcretion of ſome one or other, the
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:018549_0087_0FA7ADC63311F980"/>
French navy officers having had ſome intelligence thereof, gave to underſtand to the French Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, that a man who bore ſuch character as Capt. Jones did in England, was not fit to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted amongſt them; at which Mr. de Sartine was puzzled, knowing the combined power and influence of thoſe officers in ſuch caſe on one ſide, and on the other that Capt. Jones had his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance to be employed, which, had Capt. Jones made public, might have given a ſhake to Mr. de Sartine. In order to avoid either, a plan was laid for obtaining a King's ſhip to fit out (the Bon-homme Richard was pitched upon) in order to go and land on ſome part of the coaſt of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land or other adjacent iſland: the Marquis de la Fayette, and part of the regiment he was Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of, were to go on board of her, the planner repreſented that the force of a ſingle ſhip was too little to have any great effect, he had ſomebody then to ſupport his repreſentation, and the Alliance, Pallas, Vengeance, and Cerf, were ordered to l'Orient, where being all arrived and joined with the Bon-homme Richard, they were put under Capt. Jones's orders; when all the expences for fitting out thoſe veſſels, were made, and they were ready, the plan of that expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was dexterouſly printed in the Engliſh public news-paper, by which the execution of it became impractible, whereof, I ſuppoſe, Capt. Jones did not grieve at, as he might have been embaraſſed in puting it in execution, and would have had a ſuperior on board capable of judging his conduct in this reſpect: but by that plan being abandoned, he remained, he thought. Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the little ſquadron, without any ſuperior on board to cenſure his future deeds: the former plan being put aſide, there was no immediate employment for thoſe veſſels, and if they had been diſarmed, part of the expences for fitting them for ſea, muſt have been totally loſt, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body of power or influence being well acquainted with the caſe, I ſuppoſe, aſſociated together, and obtained them for a cruize, anſwering for them, and accordingly became concerned in that little ſquadron. But his Excellency, after the government had made over thoſe veſſels to private men, would have expoſed himſelf in keeping any longer the Alliance, United States' Frigate, under the Bon-homme Richard, become, by the above-mentioned circumſtance, a privateer, which happened during the time between the dates of his Excellency's firſt and ſecond orders to me, relative to the Bon-homme Richard, therefore he took care in the laſt one, not to put me under Capt. Jones's command: moreover, Capt. Jones was, perhaps, acquainted with ſome of the concerned's tranſactions, which they might not chuſe to have publiſhed, and had to pay for the ſunk ſhip, the Bon-homme Richard, but by raiſing and ſupporting Capt. Jones, far above his deſert, they avoided thoſe dangers, as I ſuppoſe the King took the loſs of that ſhip on govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's account, on conſideration of the unparelleled bravery, his Majeſty was taugnt to believe of Capt. Jones.</p>
            <p>But it is certain that the French Miniſter did not appear by the following certificates, to believe wholly Capt. Jones's relation, and in particular that I was guilty in any reſpect what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, viz.</p>

agent, without his orders, or not, and if he gave orders to make ſuch propoſals to me, whether he thought me guilty, ſince his offers were rewards rather than puniſhment; but I refuſed all, being willing to accept nothing, but my command of the Frigate Alliance, and if I could by no means obtain it, my paſſage to America.</p>
            <p>Whilſt I was kept by his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> in Paris, I viſited frequently the Honorables Arthur Lee, R. D. Izard, and Commodore Gillon, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and ſpoke to them ſeparately about his Excellency's deſpotic conduct towards me, and aſked of them if they knew, or it was their opinion, he was inveſted with unlimitted power by Congreſs, and whether he could take the command of a United States' man-of-war, given by Congreſs, to one of their Captains from him; and whether ſaid Captain was not anſwerable to Congreſs for the man-of-war they had entruſted him with: all thoſe gentlemens anſwers agreed, and their opinion was that no power whatever could take ſuch a command from ſuch a Captain, without the formal proceſs of a Court-martial, as dictated by the nautic law, and therefore the Captain was anſwerable for the veſſel entruſted to him by Congreſs, until he had deliverd her back to them or their Admiralty-board.</p>
            <p>One day, after I had dined, at the Honorable Arthur Lee, Eſq's, he told me he conceived how wrongly I had been uſed by my enemies in France: and added, that they had many friends in America, to whom they would write, and who would make intereſt there to juſtify their deeds againſt me; beſides that, Mr. de Sartine, by all appearance, would alſo write there to the ſame purpoſe, and I ſhould never obtain juſtice, therefore I had better deliver to him the commiſſion I had of Congreſs; ſuch a propoſal offended me (as it ſhowed me the little opinion he had of Congreſs' juſtice or ſagacity, and of my delicacy in ſuppoſing I would not come to America, my adopted country, where I was naturalized, to be tried, in order to juſtify my former conduct) I told him that I wondered how he could aſk of an officer of honour, to deliver his commiſſion to him, and expect he would do it, rather than go and ſubmit to the event of his trial, which would never vilify him more, let it be never ſo unjuſt, than to deliver his commiſſion, to avoid it; but inſtead of giving up the point, he inſiſted more than before upon it, which made me leave him abruptly, and I never ſaw him ſince in Paris: had I been of a ſuſpectful diſpoſition, it might have created in my mind, without other foundation, that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate orders had been given, to get rid of me, by ſome means or other, as my reward for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought the ſhip Flamand and her cargo to America; for I could not comprehend what good my commiſſion would have done him otherwiſe, but it would have deprived me of my right to claim for juſtice, the gratuity, my pay and prize-money owing to me, as a deſerter who has abandoned his poſt, if I had given willingly my commiſſion away: on the other hand, if he really wanted to give good counſel in telling me not to go to America, he could have done it without inſiſting on my delivering to him my commiſſion, even if I had deſiſted from all claim, I could have kept it without being a great burden to me; but I muſt ſuppoſe he had his own views in it, which I could never gueſs at, fearing to offend ſomebody or other in thoughts.</p>

                  <p>Your Excellency ſays that I have received a conſiderable ſum of money: the money which I received I ſpent coming from Holland; and the ſum for part of the time I have ſtayed in Paris, ſince I arrived here by your order, is but fifty Louis-d'ors, beſides what I received in Holland.</p>
                  <p>As to any other money, your Excellency knows I received none, not even a coat, or a ſuit of cloaths that was offered me in Breſt from your Excellency, by Mr. Adams, on account of what was owing to me, which I thought was not acceptable. I have ſpent a great deal for my expences in the ſhip's ſervice, poſtage of letters from your Excellency and agents, &amp;c. and have never charged or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a farthing on any account; therefore I beg, as a favour, that I be paid what is due to me for prime-money, and months pay while I am in France, that I may remit the money I have ſpent all that time, where I draw'd it from: your Excellency ſees by the above, I aſk for a paſſage to Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, my adoptive country, for to be tried, an order for my ſtaying here 'till I go there, my trunks to me remitted at the agent, ſealed up, for I will not receive them 'till I have ſeen whether all what I left in them is there ſtill, or your Excellency's refuſal, in writing, to thoſe demands, you will not think pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to grant me, if any.</p>

                  <p>I received the letter you did me the honor of writing to me the firſt inſtant, and the encloſed certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, dated Feb. <hi>14, 1780,</hi> it might have been on the table when I was at your houſe, but I don't recollect of having ſeen it at all.</p>
                  <p>I muſt obſerve that before that time, I had aſked of your Excellency for ſome money, having long ſince ſpent the remaining of the fifty Louis-d'ors, after I had reimburſed myſelf of what money I had took out of my own pocket for coming to Paris.</p>
                  <p>I have none of the officers on board the Frigate Alliance, now under my command, nor friend enough to aſk them to take the trouble to have my trunks landed and delivered to my direction; beſide, they don't know, nor myſelf neither at preſent, what they contain; all I know is, that all the ſhip's papers were in them, and I will not make myſelf accountable for the ſhip's expence accounts, when I may have been deprived of them; beſide, all my own things may have been plundered, and nothing but the trunks left. The Captain and officers are under your orders, and will obey them as ſoon as your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency will take the trouble to write to them to have the ſaid trunks, &amp;c. ſealed up and delivered to the agent at l'Orient, where I expect to go and ſearch whether they are as I left them, for I have to deal with people who have not the beſt character in England, according to their public papers; it was not ſo either in England or France before your Excellency had a letter filled with falſhood, from Capt. Jones, printed againſt mine. For my part, I don't judge in the preſent circumſtance, but will
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:018549_0091_0FA7ADCC39463B40"/>
not confide any more in them. If your Excellency had wrote to me at Texel, that the command of the Frigate Alliance was to be taken from me and given to another, I would have ſpared you ſuch trouble, but I came as you directed me—confiding in your juſtice.</p>
                  <p>As to the Dutch money I received in Holland, and that which I received ſince in Paris, I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make a ſhort account of what I have ſpent out of it, viz.—In Holland to go twice from the Helder to Amſterdam, and going back once; for twelve days during my ſtay in Amſterdam, being two different times there, and travelling through Holland, I ſpent all the Dutch money I had received: I ſpent out of my own pocket money travelling through Flanders and France coming to Paris, nineteen Louis-d'ors, ſo remained but thirty-one Louis-d'ors of the fifty I received firſt for my daily expences. I have been here four months, and compelled to go to Paſſy may be twenty times, and hire every time a coach, which expence amount to fifteen Louis-d'ors; my expence for myſelf and ſervant for living, lodging, firing, &amp;c. during four months, amount to about ſixty Louis-d'ors: and I find I have ſpent ten Louis-d'ors for other ſmall expences, ſo I have now left ſixty-four Louis-d'ors: I ſhall ſpend five-and-twenty more to go where I may find a ſhip; then I will have for proviſions, &amp;c. twenty-nine Louis-d'ors; ſo I wiſh your Excellency would be ſo obliging as to tell me what I muſt do for my paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, if I find one, which I have wrote for: for all, I believe it ought to be procured for me by your Excellency's order, as is uſual amongſt all nations, to provide proper means for an officer to go to be tried when accuſed, even if he has been puniſhed before hand for what he is accuſed of, without proper method.</p>
                  <p>As to my prize-money, I wiſh your Excellency would be ſo obliging as to let me know whom I muſt apply to for receiving it, that I may reimburſe the money I have borrowed and ſpent ſince I have been in Europe. I don't imagine your Excellency would have me receive in America, in paper money, what came to my ſhare for the prizes ſold in Europe for hard money, it ſhould be a poor trade, and I doubt that my friends would accept it in return for the money I have drawn upon them. Excuſe my error if you pleaſe; but I was told by ſomebody that the Bon-homme Richard, &amp;c. were belonging to Congreſs; that you or the Congreſs' agent, had them at your command. When I have aſk'd your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency for my monthly pay, I thought it juſt, as I have received none ſince my arrival; and what I have ſpent has been chiefly when I was on the ſhip's duty, poſtage of letters, &amp;c. But your Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy don't judge it proper.</p>
                  <p>I am ſorry to hear your Excellency ſays tis not in your power to give me a paſſage for America. I beg of your Excellency to conſider your power, and recollect that by it you had me drawn from the ſhip the Hon. Congreſs had entruſted me with, and that you gave and left it to my accuſer, who is accuſed by Capt. Cottineau, in a letter you have had in your own hands; recollect too, if you pleaſe, that I have ſhown you my commiſſion and naturalization in America, where I muſt be judged. If your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency will not procure me a paſſage for going there, I muſt at leaſt give you my humble thanks for your advice upon the many veſſels you ſay are bound to America.</p>

            <p n="1">1ſt. It may be obſerved that his Excellency in ſaying he had wrote long ſince to deliver the things I had on board the Alliance, hints that I muſt know it, though he never before told me thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. By his Excellency's way of expreſſing himſelf, it may be underſtood that he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured for me a paſſage to America; which he never did.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. It was then, and it is ſtill his Excellency's duty to have the Alliance's officers and crew, paid their prize-money, by Mr. le Ray de Chaumont, ſince upon a requeſt of ſome concerned in fitting out the Bon-homme Richard, &amp;c. he had lent the Alliance, with her of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and crew, to them, and had ordered the prizes to be delivered to ſaid Mr. le Ray de Chaumont, or his correſpondents.</p>
            <p n="4">4thy. His Excellency ſays that <hi>I and the people of the Alliance were in a continual quarrel toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from the time of my taking the command of her at Boſton.</hi> Though I never complained againſt the foremaſt men (who muſt be underſtood by word, people) on my account, nor heard that they had complained of me, and he proceeds ſaying, that <hi>after the repeated complaints made by me as him of the officers,</hi> which cannot be, as I wrote to him only one letter on that topic, by
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:018549_0094_0FA7ADCE779AECA0"/>
which (as well as I remember, the minute of that letter being loſt) I acquainted him that I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to ſee another command the Frigate Alliance, rather than to continue in her with ſuch officers as thoſe, and I acquainted thereof, likewiſe, M. le Ray de Chaumont, as being his agent; but by his Excellency's order to Capt. Jones, a court of honor was held at l'Orient, in order to judge between the officers and me, whoſe report to Capt. Jones was, that the officers had no ſufficient roaſons to complain againſt me; which report I ſuppoſe Capt. Jones tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his Excellency; if he did not, I told him of it, and that the Firſt and Second-Lieutenants having left the ſhip on the 17th June, 1779, the other officers had behaved better the laſt cruize, and therefore the ſame cauſe was extant no longer, which his Excellency knew very well; but he graſped at any thing to juſtify his taking ſaid command from me; and what proves more the inconſiſtency of what he ſays, with his judgment, is that if the officers had had any reaſons to complain againſt me, it would have given ſtill more force to their certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, of my good conduct during the engagement of the 23d Sept. His Excellency ſays, that <hi>I never gave the leaſt intimation of a wiſh to return to the Alliance during the four months I had been in Paris;</hi> though all my converſation with him implied it, being on that topic, and which is expreſſed in ſeveral of my letters to him, aſking him by what right he had took the command of the Alliance, and kept it from me, by giving it to Capt. Jones. Moreover, it was his own duty (ſince he had ordered me to leave her to come to Paris, where he kept me by his orders) to order me to go back to my office on board of her. His Excellency ſays, with the ſame aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, that <hi>I made the demand of being re-placed in that ſhip, when I knew ſhe was juſt on the point of ſailing;</hi> though three months after, when I reſumed my command of her, ſhe was far from being ready to ſail. His Excellency ſays that, perhaps, my demand is chiefly made to obtain a refuſal, which may be of ſervice to me in America; and after having ſaid a parcel of things, as the opinion he formed of me, he proceeds and ſays, I may burn it; what a paradox! for if I had burnt it, it could not be of any ſervice to me in America; indeed, I ſuppoſe, he made ſaid refuſal, as he did, on purpoſe that I might be aſhamed to ſhew it, and would burn it; but as it was made thus by him, and the reaſon why he made it thus, may be ſeen through better than it can be explained. I am very far from being aſhamed to ſhew it, but I ſhould be, if it had been made by any man leſs partial than his Excellency.—His Excellency ſays, he thinks me ſo imprudent, ſo litigious, and quarrelſome, &amp;c. if his Excellency means that I was imprudent in taking the command of the ſhip Flamand, and brought her to America, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his bare word, that I ſhould receive twelve thouſand livres therefor, as ſoon as arrived there; if he means that I was imprudent to come from Holland to Paris, on his promiſe of juſtice; if he means that I was imprudent to deliver to him the orders he had given me to ſtay in Paris, which he kept, and gave me only a certificate therefor, he is right; his Excellency is alſo right, if he means by litigious, that I would not obey Capt. Jones's verbal orders, in preferrence to thoſe I had received from his Excellency; if he means that I found and proved that which he had told me was not as he had ſaid, but quite the contrary; if he means that againſt his intention and others, I gave him ſo many authentic proofs of my good conduct before, during and after the engagement, on the 23d 1779: if he means that I proved Capt. Jones and abettors' charges againſt me, were groundleſs; and moreover, the bad conduct of Capt. Jones, all along, he is right.—His Excellency is right, if he means by quarrelſome, that I feel and reſent any inſult done to me by men who have any principle, and aſk ſatisfaction of thoſe, but when they have no honor, and refuſe it, I deſpiſe and overlook them.—His Excellency ſays, thoſe things are the opinion he formed of me, but if his opinions proceed from his mind, and his mind is bad, I cannot help it, but will not be judged by his opinion only, as there are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:018549_0095_0FA7ADCF692EF800"/>
judges—His Excellency hints <hi>my demand has make it neceſſary that he ſhould give me his opinions of my diſpoſitions;</hi> I never aſked for his opinion, but aſked for the command of the Alliance, or his refuſal thereof, but as he was not willing to give it me back, after all he had done to deprive me thereof; he muſt, to juſtify his refuſal, find fault with my diſpoſitions ſince he could not find any in my ſervice.—His Excellency ſays, <hi>As to my military ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, he leaves them to more capable judges than him.</hi> I think he had no more power from Congreſs, to judge my diſpoſitions of temper, than my military operations; but what was his intention to call me from my command in Holland, to Paris, to judge my military opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if he was not empowered by Congreſs and his own faculties; and if he is not capable, with all his might, to find fault with my military operations, why does he keep me from my command, and leave it with Capt. Jones, who is really accuſed by me and others.—His Excellency ſays that the ſame temper which excluded me from the French marine, would have weight with him. What does he mean by that? does he want to give me alſo a bad cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter whilſt I was in the French ſervice, upon no more ground than he has done in the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican one? I defy him and any other whoſoever, to prove any thing againſt my official, public or private character, during the time I was in the French ſervice, before or after; I have no good foundation to ſay as much of him, and ſhould be afraid to be really proved imprudent, if I did; but I was never excluded the French ſervice, as is proved by the King's certificate hereafter; and the French Miniſter's indirect offers, I have given heretofore, and others I will give hereafter, to make me return from the American ſervice into the French one.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. His Excellency ſays that <hi>he is aſſured I have two good qualities as Captain of a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant ſhip, oeconomy and integrity.</hi> I always thought either were very eſſential to be in a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of man-of-war, or I could or would never have accepted ſuch a command; and both more neceſſary ſtill on board a republic one, becauſe if I am not miſtaken, oeconomy ſaves the repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic's property; beſides, in his Excellency's letter to me at <hi>Breſt, Feb.</hi> 10<hi>th, he recommended to me to be very moderate in my demands for reſitting the Alliance;</hi> and in anſwer to my demands of abſolute neceſſity, to refit her; in his letter alſo at <hi>Breſt, March</hi> 4<hi>th,</hi> he ſaid, I am afraid you will contrive to make ſuch expences, that being unable to pay. I ſhall be obliged to ſell the Alliance, and therefore oeconomy was recommended by him to me, which he cannot blame in a Captain of man-of-war, without being inconſiſtant with himſelf. Integrity, if he was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to conceive it, as I do, implies juſtice and honor, which are moſt requiſite in a Captain of man-of-war, and particularly in a Captain of a free people, more than in any other, as there are a number of freemen under the Captain, who is inveſted with all powers whatever, legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, military juriſprudence, &amp;c. &amp;c. until his return to his country, when and where he is accountable for the uſe he has made of ſuch extenſive a power, before his ſuperiors and peers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore an arbitrary or tyrannical man ought to be excluded from ſuch office, and a man of integrity, preferred to him. But his Excellency preferred Capt. Jones to me, I ſuppoſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their principles agreed better together.</p>
            <p n="6">6thly. His Excellency ſays in his poſtſcription, that he paſſed over the charges made or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated againſt him in my letters, becauſe he could not with all his art, vindicate them, as they were palpable. Here follows the King's certificate of my conduct in his ſervice, wrote, as it is, in French, viz.</p>

            <p>Seeing that I could expect neither juſtice, redreſs, paſſage to America, pay, nor prize-money, from his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, Eſq, I left Paris, and went to l'Orient.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as arrived there, I went to pay my viſit to Mr. Thevenard, Commander of the harbour, at that time; he told me if I had a mind to have the command of the ſhip of war, Serapis (which had been brought into that harbour) he would help me to obtain it; I repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him I could not, as I was in the American navy, and that charges againſt my conduct in that ſervice, having been publiſhed in the papers, the command of the Alliance taken from me, my only wiſh then was to go to America, to juſtify myſelf on all accounts whatever, before thoſe that had entruſted ſaid command to me; he replied, as to what was printed againſt you and made public, it is eaſy to mend it by having your juſtification, and as much praiſe in your favor printed in the ſame paper; but if you go to America for juſtice, it will be eaſy for thoſe who have prevailed, to have the Alliance taken from you, by their influence, to have you alſo ſacrificed there; I ſaid I expected more juſtice there, than that came to, but even if it proved ſo, it was my duty to go there, at all event.</p>
            <p>Some days after, during my ſecond viſit to Mr. Thevenard, he was more explicit, and told me that if I would have the command of the Serapis, I might, as he had it in his hand; it was his words; meaning, I ſuppoſe, that he was empowered by the French navy's Miniſter, to give it me; my anſwer was ſimilar to the one I made on my firſt viſit, and that I muſt go to America: he replied, I could not go there, as I ſhould be prevented, and that all my ſteps were watched; I turned it into a joke, aſking him if his ſpies had reported to him, whether I kept bad company or not; he ſaid he was convinced I kept no bad one, but that I ſhould not go to America; I told him that he might do his duty, in his ſervice, in preventing me, and that I would do my utmoſt in the American one, in order to go there.</p>
            <p>The King's certificate is an evident and undeniable proof that I was not excluded the French ſervice, as hinted in his Excellency's letter, and the offer of Mr. Thevenard is a new ſemi-proof that I was wanted to return in it. Moreover, it may be obſerved, that all the precautions were taker to prevent my coming to America, my enemies fearing that I would obtain juſtice there.</p>
            <p>On my arrival at l'Orient, the officers teſtified to me the deſire they had that I would reſume my command on board the Alliance. And her former crew which had ſerved under my order, ſwore loudly, in the ſtreets, they would never ſail on board ſaid Frigate, under any other Captain but me.</p>

                  <p>I have been waiting ever ſince I came to l'Orient, for your order to me, to take the command of the Alliance, thinking you could have reflected how ſhe was taken from me. I ſhould look upon my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf culpable to remain a tame ſpectator, while my authority on board her is uſurped by another, ſince I have been placed to that command by a reſolve of the honorable Congreſs. It appears to me upon conſideration, that nothing can authoriſe your Excellency to this proceeding of diſplacing me; I am perſuaded that even the Congreſs themſelves would never pretend to exerciſe a power ſo arbitrary as to overthrow their officers without tryal, were their reaſons ever ſo well founded, much leſs upon a parcel of ſcandalous charges, invented to cover the ignorance and miſbehaviour of a man who would ſacrifice the reputation of the officers and men of a whole fleet, to eſtabliſh himſelf.</p>

            <p>I aſked the officers formerly belonging to the Bon-homme Richard, whether the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged me to be the only lawful Captain of the Alliance; they anſwered they had ſhipped with P.

            <p>I inſtantly wrote, to the Commander of the harbour, to the Commander of the road, and to Capt Jones, each a letter, acquainting them that I had reſumed my command on board the Alliance; Capt. Jones only refuſed to receive my letter.</p>
            <p>I enquired of the officers, the ſituation the ſhip was in, in all reſpects; they told me there was in the hold, two hundred and ſixteen barrels of gun-powder, eighteen iron eighteens, and eighteen nine pounders, guns; and that it was full: beſides, there were between decks, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty two boxes of ſmall-arms. The officers told me alſo that Capt. Jones had been on board, in the morning, and had told them he was going to America in the Alliance, as ſoon as ſhe could be ready to ſail. I gave the orders I thought neceſſary for the ſecurity and police of the ſhip, and to fit and prepare her as ſoon as poſſible, for ſea.</p>
            <p>The Commander of the harbour, Mr. de Thevenard ſent me word he wanted to ſpeak to me; I ſent him in anſwer, I could not leave the ſhip on any account whatever: he kept writing to me daily, until I was out of the harbour, inviting me at firſt, and after, ordering me to go on ſhore; I anſwered, I was ſorry I could not comply with his deſire, nor obey his orders, as my duty in the United States' ſervice I was in, required my ſtaying on board.</p>

               </gap>ay Meſſ'rs Moylan and Jonathan Williams came on board to bring me a letter, they ſaid, from Dr. Franklin, but inſiſted that, as the direction was to Peter Landais, formerly Captain of the Alliance, I ſhould expreſs the ſame words; I offered to open the letter, ſhow them the date and ſignature in it, and give a receipt, mentioning whom it came from, and on what date, but they would not, and carried it back.</p>
            <p>On the 20th inſtant, the wind S. W. calm, I ordered in the evening to unmoor and me warped down the Frigate; at day-break, being two muſket-ſhots off Port Louis's citidal, the wind beginning to blow freſh, we came at an anchor. In the afternoon, many boats came down from l'Orient, with cables and anchors, and made a boom acroſs the entry of the harbour, juſt below the Alliance. I had intelligence that Capt. Jones had obtained the fitting out of a row-galley, with many boats, loaded with ſoldiers, in order to come, board, and ſurprize the Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the night: in the evening I ſent a letter to the Commander of the citadel, to deſire him to have the entry of the harbour open, that the Alliance might go out: he gave no anſwer: About 9 o'clock, P. M. I perceived the row-galley, in the dark, coming down, as I had heard, an hour before, one of the Bon-homme Richard's men, who was in irons, with the reſt of them, ſay to the others, that they would ſoon be free, and I ſhould not live in two hours time; as the Gunner had brought me word of their threats, on that account; as I thought I had ſtrong rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſuſpecting the Captain of marines, to be in Capt. Jones plot, I ordered thoſe men of the Bon-homme Richard to be put between decks, and divided the officers and men all along the ſhip; the latter armed with pikes, with order to prevent any body who would offer to
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:018549_0103_0FA7AC58ABAA2D48"/>
come on board; I drew my ſword, took a ſpeaking-trumpet, and went on the forecaſtle; I ſent word to the Captain of marines to deliver ſome muſkets to the crew, but he would not; I went off myſelf and aſked him why he refuſed to obey my orders; he replied, he had his marines under arms, and they were enough: as I knew that one Serjeant and ſeveral of the marines had already received, on ſhore, ſome money by Capt. Jones's direction, and, may be, a great many others, I had no great truſt in any of the marines under Capt. Parke; I went to open the arm-cheſts, but ſaw a quantity of muſkets, with bayonets ready fixed, ſtanding up at the end of the cheſt; I told the people to take them and diſperſe all along the ſhip: this increaſed ſtill my ſuſpicion, as I conjectured thoſe muſkets were there ready in order to arm the Bon-homme Richard's people, who could have eaſily got out of irons, had I not ordered them ſecretly to be put between decks: almoſt convinced of Capt. Parke's treachery, by his denial to have muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets delivered as I had ordered, I told him to take care how he ſhould behave: and I told Mr. Blodget, aſide, to run him through, if he proved undutiful and a traitor. I went again for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the galley coming down very ſilently, when at two muſket-ſhots diſtance, I hailed her; as ſoon as they heard my voice, finding I was not kept down to read a pack of letters that Capt. Parke had received, and attempted to make me read a quarter of an hour before; they came at anchor, and undertook nothing, hearing me upon deck all night. The next morning they took off the boom, and having weighed the anchor, we drove out with the tide, paying away of a hawſer, faſtened to a mooring; and aboat 9 o'clock, A. M. came at anchor, and moored about two miles South Weſt of the citidel of Port Louis.</p>

                  <p>"The reſolution you declared yeſterday of not ſailing 'til the prize-money was paid, has given me ſo much uneaſineſs, as well on your account as on that of the public, that I cannot help ſtating to you on paper my reaſons for thinking you ought not to delay ſailing one moment after the wind will permit.</p>
                  <p>"It is manifeſt, from the expreſs order ſent for the immediate return of the Frigate, that ſhe is wanted in America; and ſhe contains ſo valuable a cargo, that every moment's delay, or unneceſſary riſque of it, is a public injury; when the attainment of what your are waiting for is ſo far diſtant and uncertain, even in your own opinion, that you might make a voyage to America and return again, before there is a probability of the matter being decided. I ſuppoſe the ſhip and cargo under your care, are of two millions value to the public: your ſtay, eſpecially in ſuch an expoſed ſituation, riſques theſe for a precarious expectation of fifty thouſand; add to this, that the former is a public, the latter a private object, which ſhould never be preferred. It is certainly very laudable in you to endeavour to have juſtice done to the officers and men under your command; but it is as aſſuredly culpable to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice the eſſential intereſts of the public to that purſuit, nor will any thing juſtify an officer for diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his orders, but the impoſſibility of executing them.</p>
                  <p>"The deſire of the officers and crew to return to their native country, prevails at preſent over the wiſh of obtaining their prize-money; but who can anſwer how long that diſpoſition will continue? If you ſtay here, you muſt let them come on ſhore and expoſe them to involve themſelves in new debts, and to be acted upon by the arts of ſuggeſtions of thoſe who are watching every opportunity of ſeducing them and diſturbing the harmony on board, which will inevitably ſoon produce ill-humour and diſcontent; upon which your enemies will contrive, in ſpite of every precaution you can take, to improve ſo as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely to embarraſs, if not totally ſtop your proceedings. It is in the power of thoſe who wiſh you ill, and would be happy to ſee you incur blame, to delay the payment of the prize-money; and you are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing them the ſtrongeſt of all inducements to do this, becauſe they know it will delay, embarraſs, and bring cenſure upon you: and this they may do, without its being poſſible for you to obtain proofs of its being their fault. Thus your delay will give the pleaſure to your enemies of ſaying, with every appearance of truth, that your taking the command has prevented the return of the Frigate, detained the ſupplies, and thrown every thing into confuſion.</p>
                  <p>"As to the juſtice due to the people of the Alliance, it appears to be a ſtrange way of repairing the injuries they have ſuffered from being detained ſo long in Europe, and not having any prize-money; to detain them ſtill longer, and be the means of delaying the payment ſtill more: more eſpecially as they cannot get the payment of their wages until they return to America, and that one month's cruize upon their own coaſt, would not only do great ſervice to the public, but obtain prizes for them, of which they would be ſure to receive the profits, all which they loſe by waiting here in expectation of that which it is not reaſonable to expect.</p>

                  <p>"As I have officially been applied to by the officers of the Continental Frigate Alliance, I think it my duty to acquaint your Excellency therewith, and therefore encloſe you my reply thereto (which is the ſame as his opinion given heretofore) that you may be aufait of all I do herein, and to avoid miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation, and that by your ſuperior influence, you may direct the alarming conſequences to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, that muſt follow; ſhould any armed force of this country interfere in the regulations of the navy of America, which regulations have been eſtabliſhed by our Rulers; thus no officer can err that abides by them, and acts conformable to the laws of the land.</p>
                  <p>"Your Excellency well knows, that I ever avoided interfering with the officers or directions of any of the continental ſhips in Europe, otherwiſe I ſhould have avoided all that has now happened, as you know I was clear of opinion laſt year, that all the veſſels that appeared to be continental in this harbour laſt June and July, ſhould have directly proceeded to the relief of the country, whoſe flag they hoiſted; excepting your Excellency and the Captains of ſuch ſhips, had poſitive orders to ſend them on other cruizes, and as a farther proof, you know I at the ſame time offered to go with all the State-officers under my directions, as volunteers in that fleet then fitting out here, if going to America; this I ſay proves I did not ſeek to interfere with continental officers; but, Sir, whenever I am officially cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on for my opinion, I ſhould be wanting in my duty, did I neglect giving it; I therefore gave it as per encloſed copy, as an officer and as a citizen of America; and ſo clear I am in it, that I ſhall trouble the Continental Congreſs with a relation of all I do in this and every of any buſineſs in Europe, and ſhall alſo requeſt the Governor of the State, under whoſe particular direction I am, to lay my conduct, in this matter, regularly before Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>"If I have erred in this opinion, it can only proceed from being ignorant of any orders Congreſs has ſent to Capt. Landais, to deliver up the Alliance to you, to appoint another Captain, becauſe as Capt. Landais has a poſitive order from Congreſs, for the command of the Alliance, and that the Admiralty or Navy-Board, ſtill addreſs Capt. Landais as Captain of the Alliance; he and all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per officers in the ſervice, muſt conceive it to be his duty, to take care of his ſhip; your Excellency may, therefore, I preſume, eaſily rectify this diſpute, by complying with what every officer has a right to demand, before he obeys, that is, by your directing any perſon whom you nominate to ſuperſede Capt. Landais, as alſo to the next officer on board the Alliance, whenever your officer goes on board to take the command, the Firſt-Lieutenant of that ſhip ſhould ſee that order; this, Sir, is uſual in all ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, elſe any man might go on board of any ſhip, and take the command of her.</p>
                  <p>"I hope your Excellency will do me the juſtice to believe that all my conduct herein proceeds from no other motive but a true regard to the country I ever will revere, and from juſtice that is due to every officer in our ſervice, and becauſe I am called on officially in this unhappy buſineſs which I con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

fatal conſequences, as I will maintain the doctrine, that no foreign power has a right to interfere (particularly by force) with our American naval regulations, and that no officer can be diveſted of his command but by thoſe who gave it him, and even then but by a regular Court-martial.</p>
                  <p>"Your Excellency will pleaſe to conſider I addreſs you officially, and don't mean to offend; but to act, ſpeak, and write as every free man of America has a right to do.</p>

                  <p>"I received your letter, dated the <hi>12</hi>th of April paſt, expreſſing that you were in neceſſitous cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and that you were alarmed at having received neither wages nor prize-money, when the ſhip was ſo nearly prepared for ſea.</p>
                  <p>"Having had nothing to do with the prizes, and underſtanding that they could not ſoon be turned into money, I had anſwered the purpoſe of your letter, in the beſt manner in my power, by advancing twenty-four thouſand livres, to ſupply the moſt urgent of your neceſſities, 'till the prize-money could be obtained.</p>
                  <p>"With regard to your wages, I thought the expectation of having them paid here, was wrong. No body in Europe is empowered to pay them, and I believe it is a rule with all maritime ſtates, to pay their ſhips only at home, by an officer where the accounts are kept, and where only it can be known what agreements were made with the officers and men, what advances they have received, and what their families attornies may have received in their abſence. I had many letters and informations from l'Orient, acquainting me with the diſcontent of the people of the Alliance, at the method propoſed of valuing the prizes, in order to their being paid for by the King; and that our ſhip would not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be got out, unleſs that method was changed, and the prizes fairly ſold at auction to the higheſt bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. I then applied to have the change made, and it was readily agreed by the Miniſter of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, that they ſhould be ſold: but to ſell them ſuddenly, would again have been liable to objection, and therefore time was given in the advertiſements, that diſtant purchaſers of ſhips might know of the ſale, and a greater number of buyers give a chance of a higher price for your benefit; had the firſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod been complied with, I am inclined to think, from his Majeſty's known generoſity, a better price would have been obtained (as ſimilar inſtances have proved) than is likely to be got by the ſale, and you would have had your money ſooner: I conſented to change, to ſatisfy, and if poſſible, pleaſe you. The delay, was, by no means, agreeable te me, as it occaſioned a great additional expence, and I heartily wiſhed the ſhip in America.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="108" facs="unknown:018549_0108_0FA7AC5DEE7D36F0"/>"I did, as you have heard, ſend a memorial to the Court of Denmark, claiming a reſtitution of the prizes or of their value; this memorial was received long before they ſailed from France; they were, nevertheleſs, allowed to depart for England, and the only anſwer I have had from that Court is, that the reſtitution was made in purſuance of treaties between the two powers.</p>
                  <p>"I am not ſatisfied with this anſwer, but have laid the whole matter before Congreſs, deſiring their inſtructions. You may be aſſured that not a penny of the value has yet been paid; and that if any thing is recovered while I am concerned in the buſineſs, ſtrict juſtice will be done you, which I have alſo no doubt, will be done with regard to the Serapis and Counteſs of Scarborough.</p>
                  <p>"Having received ſeveral letters from you formerly, complaining in ſtrong terms of Capt. Landais' conduct in the government of the ſhip, and his ill treatment of all the officers, except the Purſer; and having received alſo from Capt. Landais himſelf a letter, dated at l'Orient, May <hi>15, 1779,</hi> in which he ſays, "You all joined together againſt him, even before he left Boſton; that he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed another ſet, but being ready to ſail, the Navy-Board thought your behaviour would be better when at ſea; on the contrary it grew worſe, and was come to that pitch, that he was compelled to acquaint me with it, that I might take a proper method to remedy it; and if no other was to be found he would rather chuſe to leave the command, than continue with ſuch officers.—After all this, it is a little ſurpriſing to me, that Capt. Landais, who came to Paris only to vindicate himſelf from ſome charges againſt him, and there voluntarily, as I thought (and in purſuance of his former reſolution) relinquiſhed the ſhip, by deſiring me repeatedly to give an order for taking out of her the things he had on board; and who never once, during all the time he ſtaid here, expreſſed the leaſt wiſh, or gave the leaſt hint of a deſire to be continued in her, 'till he heard ſhe was upon the point of ſailing; and now that he could demand to be placed over you, and that you ſhould wiſh to be again under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand —I know not how to account for this change.—But having agreed to what I imagined from the letters on both ſides, would be agreeable to both you and Capt. Landais, and placed another Captain in the ſhip, I cannot now comply with your requeſt. I have related exactly to Congreſs the manner of his leaving that ſhip, and though I declined any judgement of his manoeuvres in the Frigate, I have given it as my opinion, after examining the affair, that it was not all likely either that he ſhould given orders to fire into the Bon-homme Richard, or that his officers would have obeyed ſuch orders if he had given them. Thus I have taken what care I could of your honor in that particular; you will therefore excuſe me, if I am a little concerned for it in another. If it ſhould come to be publicly known, that you had the ſtrongeſt averſion to Capt. Landais, who had uſed you baſely, and that is only ſince the laſt year's cruize, and the appointment of Commodore Jones to the command, that you requeſt to be again under your old Captain, I fear ſuſpicions and reflections may be thrown upon you by the world, as if this change of ſentiment muſt have ariſen from your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations during that cruize, that Capt. Jones loved cloſe fighting, and that Capt. Landais was ſkilful in keeping out of harm's way, and that therefore you thought yourſelves ſafer with the latter. For myſelf, I believe you to be brave men, and lovers of your country and its glorious cauſe; and I am perſuaded you have only been ill adviſed, and miſled by the artful and malicious miſrepreſentations of ſome perſons I gueſs at.—Take in good part this friendly counſel of an old man, who is your friend.— Go home peaceably with your ſhip: do your duty faithfully and cheerfully: behave reſpectfully to your Commander, and I am perſuaded he will do the ſame to you. Thus you will not only be happier in your voyage, but recommend yourſelves to the future favours of Congreſs, and to the eſteem of your country.</p>

               <pb n="109" facs="unknown:018549_0109_0FA7AC5EB1E21C70"/>The officers received the foregoing letter only, June 18th 1780, by which it appears that it was antidated, to prove his Excellency's readineſs to give them money.</p>
            <p>If his Excellency had been really willing to let the Alliance's officers and crew have ſome of their prize-money, he might have done it ſooner, as the two prize-brigs, one loaded with fiſh oil, the other with beef and butter, had been ſold in France for ready money, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding month of October; he hints that, previous to his anſwering on that account, he gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly had advanced twenty-four thouſand livres, to ſupply the moſt urgent of their wants; but it appears that letter was wrote only after his Excellency knew I had reſumed (according to the officers and crew's invitation) my command on board the Alliance, in order to ſooth the officers by his liberality, to their requeſt, and draw their affection from me, who had nothing but my right and honeſty, to offer to them, to balance his kind writing and compliance to them.</p>
            <p>The money was ſent at the ſame time to the direction of Capt. Jones, whoſe adherents made uſe of it to draw, I was told, every one they could, from their duty to me; and any one of thoſe that would not acknowledge Capt. Jones to be the lawful Captain of the Alliance, either officers or foremaſt men, did not receive a farthing of it.</p>
            <p>It may be obſerved how his Excellency wants to appear ready, in order to pleaſe the officers and crew, to ſell the prizes which had been in France five months, and could have been ſold then, and thoſe officers and crew paid therefor, when he might have agreed with the French Miniſter and others concerned thereupon; but inſtead of that, he ſtill makes uſe of ſpecious reaſons for retarding the ſale of them, and keep them from being paid for. His Excellency after a long prologue, ſays, that he conſented to change (the way of ſelling the prizes) to ſatisfy and pleaſe the officers. N. B. by which word <hi>conſented,</hi> he owns it was in his power to have them ſold any way, at any time, though he and the other concerned, had no buſineſs to meddle with the Serapis and Counteſs of Scarborough men-of-war prizes, which were wholly belonging to their conquerors, if the Bon-homme Richard had been either King or United States' veſſels.</p>
            <p>His Excellency is pretty explicit in the paragraph relative to the Alliance's prizes ſent to Bergen, ſaying he had ſent himſelf a memorial to the Court of Denmark about them (though he ſaid in the ſecond paragraph he had had nothing to do with the prizes, but he does not ſay as much with regard to their produce) But there is another obſervation to be made about his Excellency's ſending himſelf a memorial, claiming thoſe prizes from the Court of Denmark, as if the Bon-homme Richard and the Vengeance had been King's veſſels, having an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of right to claim a ſhare in the prize-ſhip Union; the French Miniſter's memorial to claim that prize in the King's name, would have had more weight then with that Court, than the United States' Miniſter. The United States' independence, being yet unacknowledged by that Court; therefore his Excellency writing ſaid memorial to that Court, corroborates with his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Commodore Gillon, that the Bon-homme Richard, &amp;c. (were not King's ſhips but pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateers) belonging to concerned. Moreover, his Excellency, even by that paragraph and others, is bound for the prize ſhare to the Alliance's company.</p>
            <p>In the paragraph wherein his Excellency ſays, that a year before the officers of the Alliance had complained againſt me, then in ſtrong terms; he does not ſay they ever complained againſt me ſince that time, becauſe at that time the Firſt and Second-Lieutenants having left her, the others were all pretty quiet. It may be obſerved, that his Excellency knew thoſe two Lieutenants had left the ſhip, ſince he directed the foregoing letter to Lieut. Degge, who was the year before only Third-Lieutenant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> moreover, he knew that all the officers and crew had lately wrote to him to reinſtate me Captain of the Alliance, as the only lawful one of her: on the other hand, his Excellency rehearſe the purport of my letter, dated May 15, 1779, the only one in which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained againſt the officers undutifulneſs; but ſince that time no letter either ſide had been
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:018549_0110_0FA7AC5F6CE681C0"/>
wrote on the ſame ſubject, conſequently he had no reaſon then to deprive me of my command on that account. But it appears to me, that his Excellency having exhauſted all his ſkill to take the command of the Alliance from me, and give it to Capt. Jones; knowing that he could never find any good reaſon to juſtify his conduct therein, he wrote to the officers that he had ſent them ſome money to ſooth them firſt, after he reminded thoſe of the animoſity they had againſt me a year before, and how, word by word, I had complained againſt them, to raiſe it again; both which inducements might have prevailed upon their minds, and made them prefer the money and Capt. Jones, to me; was it wiſdom, juſtice, and duty in a Miniſter, to write thus to officers, in order to raiſe their jealouſy againſt their Captain, I leave it to be judged, and whether it is not owing to that letter to the officers, that they aroſe, and the whole crew afterwards, againſt Congreſs's orders and mine?</p>
            <p>How his Excellency miſrepreſents the fact, ſaying that I went to Paris, &amp;c. he does not ſay he wrote me to go there, but hints I went on my own accord; he does not ſay neither that he gave me an order to ſtay there, fearing I would go back on board the Alliance, in Holland, and that he kept me thus there, about four months; he rather gives to underſtand that I relinquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my command, all which is proved falſe by my letters to him; he pretends I aſked only for my things; but he does not ſay it was long after Capt. Jones had the command of the Alliance; beſides, his Excellency knew it was in obedience to his letter to me in Holland, that I went to him in Paris, where he kept me by his order, and where it was his duty to give me another order to go and take my command, even if I had never ſpoke to him about it, as I did. His Excellency pretends I never hinted the leaſt deſire, during the time I was in Paris, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in that ſhip, but when I knew ſhe was on the point of ſailing: he does not mention at what time I claimed of him my command, wanting to make underſtand that I never did it before I was in l'Orient, as the Alliance had never, ſince her laſt arrival there, been on the point of ſailing, until after I reſumed my command on board of her, as he ſays, <hi>and that now he ſhould demand to be placed over you, and that you ſhould wiſh to be again under his command;—I know not how to account for this change:</hi> wherein he expreſſes the word now, as if I had never before mentioned any thing about it; and he did not forget to make them ſenſible I demanded to be placed <hi>over them,</hi> and they wiſhed to be again under my command, I ſuppoſe, to raiſe their jealouſy again againſt me. But a ſtriking obſervation may be made here, which is, if his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency was fully perſuaded of the eſſential prejudice and animoſity of the Alliance's officers againſt me, their certificates of the ſketch and relation of the engagement on the 23d Sept. 1779, to juſtify my good conduct, had ſo much the more force, being given by my enemies.—His Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency ſays, that <hi>he had agreed to what he imagined from the letters on both ſides, would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to both the officers and me.</hi> He knew the ſame cauſe did not exiſt for a year paſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was no reaſon remaining then therefor: moreover, if his Excellency, out of complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, did condeſcend to the officers wiſhes and mine, made a year before, why did not his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency likewiſe condeſcend to the then wiſhes of the Alliance's officers, crew and mine, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhing me in the command of the Alliance, which would have agreed with my right to it, juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and the reſolution of Congreſs thereabout? and why did he prefer to keep Capt. Jones in that command, though accuſed, and againſt all right! let his Excellency account for it. But his Excellency ſays, <hi>he has related exactly to Congreſs, the manner of my leaving that ſhip.</hi> I ſhould be very curious to know how he had related to Congreſs, I had left her: But I may ſay with exactneſs, I left her in a ſimilar manner as I had commanded her; that is, having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore delivered a liſt of the articles ſhe wanted, to be refitted, to Mr. Neuville; having aſked of Capt. Jones part of her crew he kept by force, on board the Serapis, which he refuſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, though he knew the quantity of her ſick people, and the number of priſoners on board to
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:018549_0111_0FA7AC6031FA47F0"/>
be guarded, all which prevented the repair of the Alliance: When I received his Excellency's letter to me for going to Paris, I gave a written order to Mr. Degge, Firſt-Lieutenant of the Alliance, to keep the command of her until my return back on board, after which I proceeded to Paris, in obedience to his Excellency; if he has not related thus my leaving that Frigate in Holland, he has not been more exact in that particular, than in others: but the reader may judge by the foregoing letter to the officers, what he was capable of writing to Congreſs, and others in America, againſt me.—His Excellency ſays to the officers, <hi>that he had taken care of their honor;</hi>—but after he ſays, <hi>if it ſhould come to be publicly known that you had the ſtrongeſt averſion to Capt. Landais, who had uſed you baſely, &amp;c.</hi> which is paradoxical as much as can be, for if the officers had honor to take care of by his Excellency, they having given me their authentic certificate of my good conduct, during the engagement, though they had the ſtrongeſt averſion to me, who had uſed them (his Excellency ſays) <hi>baſely;</hi> it muſt be acknowledged that the officers certificate was given to my good conduct, without any favour whatever and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that my conduct was really good.—His Excellency's reflections and apprehenſions of the public ſuſpicion on the cauſe, why the officers preferred me to Capt. Jones, for commanding the Alliance, may have taken place, becauſe his Excellency had perſuaded the ſaid public, by his having had the falſe relation of Capt. Jones (authenticated by his Excellency's name to it) printed: therefore the public might very well have been deceived by it, and believe in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence thereof, Capt. Jones was a mighty man, and that I was a very guilty one. But his Excellency was not ſatisfied yet, with all he had done to ſacrifice my character in the United States' navy. He attacked it alſo, in his letter to me, dated Paſſy, March 12th, 1780, in the French one: beſides, his Excellency's letter to the officers, after having firſt promiſed them money, after ſoothed them, tried to raiſe and imbitter their animoſity againſt me; he threatens them with the public reflection on their preferring me to Capt. Jones, for Commander! but moreover and above, his Excellency does not ſtop there, he does all he can to perſuade alſo thoſe officers againſt their own ſight, hearing, knowledge, judgment, certificate, ſign, and honor, (they having been preſent with me in the engagement) of my cowardice, and of Capt. Jones's bravery, ſaying, <hi>I fear ſuſpicions and reflections may be thrown upon you by the world; as if the change of ſentiments muſt have ariſen from your obſervations during that cruize, that Capt. Jones loved cloſe fighting, and that Capt. Landais was ſkilful in keeping out of harms way, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was all this the duty and juſtice of a Miniſter of a free people, of a wiſe, candid philantro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos and philoſopher, was it prudent and politic in him to alienate, raiſe the animoſity, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, unſubordination and treachery of thoſe officers againſt their ſuperior; and was not the foregoing letter, the origin of the officers and crew riſing, ſix weeks after, againſt Congreſs's order! does not ſuch a Miniſter deſerve the contrary epithets to the name I have uſed juſt above: I leave to the reader to judge what his Excellency was capable of writing againſt me to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents; I leave to his ſagacity to find all the unexplained blackneſs concealed in the foregoing letter, and formers to me: and alſo to judge his Excellency's and Capt. Jones's conduct towards me.</p>
            <p>On the 4th July, 1780, Thomas Elick, one of the Alliance's Boatſwain's-mate, told me he had received five French guineas, of Mr. Dale, upon promiſe that he would do his utmoſt to bring the crew to a reſolution to claim and eſtabliſh Capt. Jones, Commander of the Frigate Alliance; and that he was alſo directed to tranſmit a pack of letters (which he delivered to me) to the foremaſt men of ſaid Frigate: which was directed, <hi>To the ſhip's company of the American Frigate Alliance, at anchor in the road of Grava, in France,</hi> and under Capt.

                  </opener>
                  <p>"Saturday morning laſt, I received a letter ſigned by about one hundred and fifteen of the ſailors of the Alliance, declaring that they would not raiſe the anchor, nor depart from l'Orient 'til they had fix

months wages paid them, and the utmoſt farthing of their prize-money, including the ſhips ſent into Norway, and until <hi>their legal Captain P. Landais,</hi> is reſtored to them, or to that effect. This mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny has undoubtedly been excited by that Captain, probably by making them believe that ſatisfaction has been received for thoſe Norway prizes delivered up to the Engliſh, which GOD knows, is not true; the Court of Denmark not having yet reſolved to give us a ſhilling on that account. That he is concerned in this mutiny, he has been fooliſh enough to furniſh us with proofs; the ſailors letter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only encloſed under a cover, directed to me in his hand writing, but he has alſo, in the ſame writing, interlined the words <hi>their legal Captain P. Landais,</hi> which happen to contain his ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature. I went immediately to Verſailles to demand the aſſiſtance of government; and on ſhowing the letter by which his guilt plainly appeared, an order was immediately granted, and ſent away the ſame evening, for apprehending and impriſoning him; and orders were given at the ſame time to the Commiſſary of the Port, to afford you all kind of aſſiſtance: we thought it beſt, at the ſame time, to give directions that thoſe ſailors who have ſigned this letter, ſhould not be favoured with receiving any part of the money ordered to be advanced, unleſs to ſuch as expreſs their ſorrow for having been ſo miſled, and willingneſs to do their duty; and that they may be known, this letter was ſent down to Mr. de Monplaiſir; but care ſhould be taken that it be returned, as it contains the proofs above-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned againſt Landais, who will be tried for his life, being conſidered by the Miniſters as an emigrant, without the King's permiſſion, and therefore ſtill a Frenchman. I ſee you are likely to have a great deal of trouble: it requires prudence: I wiſh you well through it. You have ſhown your abilities in fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; you have now an opportunity of ſhowing the other neceſſary part, in the character of a great chief—your abilities in government.

            <p>By the letter number one from his Excellency Benjamin Franklin to Capt. Jones, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that his Excellency was to direct me as the lawful Captain of the Alliance, to put in execution, with all poſſible expedition, the orders of the Board of Admiralty for the return of the Alliance, contained in the extract of the letter from the Board of Admiralty to his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency Benjamin Franklin, number two. And it was evident by that extract that the Alliance was ordered to go to Philadelphia.—By the leter from his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, number three, dated Paſſy, June 7, 1780, to the Honorable Captain Landais, late Commander of the Alliance, it appears that it was a copy of the letter which Meſſi'rs Williams and Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon would not deliver to me, unleſs I gave them a receipt for it, in which they wanted me to inſert, that I was <hi>late Commander of the Alliance,</hi> which I refuſed to do, and they carried the letter back; it appears further that his Excellency had ſent ſaid copy to Capt. Jones; that letter is deviced and wrote, like all his Excellency's other letters to me, with the ſame arbitrary abuſe of power and miſrepreſentations, therefore I leave the propriety of impropriety of it to be judged by the reader as well as the other; number four, which I received and gave a receipt for;—in the letter number five, from his Excellency Benjamin Franklin to Capt. Jones, dated Paſſy, June 12, 1780, his Excellency ſhows his art, his ſorrow and anger, for being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed after all the injuſtice he had done to me, for taking and keeping ſaid command from me, to give it to Capt. Jones; his Excellency charges me of guilt of which he and Capt. Jones are the only guilty, and pretends it is a mutiny to take my lawful command, taken from me by encroachment and uſurpation. <hi>And he threatens that I ſhall be tried for my life, as an emigrant, by the Miniſter, without the King's permiſſion</hi> (and his Excellency ſays) and therefore ſtill a Frenchman, and all that pretended proſecution made againſt my life, as it appears exacted from the French Miniſter, <hi>by his Excellency Benjamin Franklin, Miniſter Plenipotentiary of the United States,</hi> in France, whoſe abſolute and direct duty was to ſupport me, being naturalized in America, but after all that he had done, there is no wonder that he overlooked this immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate

part of his duty as well as others.—The letter number ſix, from his Excellency Benja<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>min Franklin, to the officers and ſeamen of the Alliance Frigate, dated Verſailles, June 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> in order to take ſaid command from me, and give it to Capt. Jones.</p>
            <p>Number ſeven is the order of Capt. Jones to me, dated l'Orient, June 28, 1780, by which he acknowledged that I was then in actual command of the American Frigate Alliance; it may be obſerved, that he wanted to make me appear again, that I was then (being at Groais Iſland, at anchor ſix miles from the main land in danger to be attacked every moment by the enemies) under his order, though his Excellency had not ordered me to be ſo, ſince I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed my command on board the Alliance. Moreover, it appears by the impropriety of the contents of Capt. Jones's order, that he wanted to expoſe the Frigate Alliance to the danger of being made defenceleſs againſt the attack of the enemies in the road ſhe was in, where they came very often, by ordering me to ſend him eighty of my beſt riggers, and all the joiners, and perhaps to ſeduce them to come and ſurprize with others, the few people on board the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Alliance during the night. All which papers are announced to the ſhip's company of the Frigate Alliance, by a letter of Capt. Jones to the ſaid ſhip's company, incloſed alſo in the ſame cover, under the ſeal of Capt. Jones, by which letter Capt. Jones prays ſaid ſhip's company to read all he ſends them with attention, &amp;c. &amp;c.—By which the reader may judge how far his Excellency Benjamin Franklin and Capt. Jones agreed in their lawleſs principles, in calling mutiny what was lawful in the ſhip's company in acknowledging and paying due obedience to me as Captain of the Alliance: and how they coincided in their threats and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of money, to raiſe undutifulneſs and real mutiny in ſaid ſhip's company, againſt my rightful command over them, in order to deprive me, and uſurp again ſaid command in favour of Capt. Jones.</p>
