            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>W<hi>Hereas it hath been customary and commendable in former and less curious times, it seems in this critical age, not only expedient, but necessary to send such discourses as the ensuing abroad into the world under the shadow &amp; protection of some Worthyes, whose countenance &amp; authority may defend them from any malevolence they may be incident unto: wherefore the following</hi> Sermon <hi>being by providence now called forth into publick view, I am necessarily emboldned to dedicate it unto your Names, not knowing to whom the patronage of it doth more properly belong.

I never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any further publication then the preaching, lest such</hi> Crambe bis cocta <hi>might not relish well in the Palates of this curious Age, so plentifully furnished with all varietyes of Wisdome &amp; Knowledge; but for their sakes who by the exigence of the Times, and present distress of the</hi> Warre, <hi>were denied the opportunity to be of the Auditory, I have condescended to make it Legible. I shall not insist upon any A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology about the Subject chosen to treat of, it giving so fair an occasion to speak of all the most important dutyes that either Rulers or People can be concerned in whatever juncture of affairs should come upon them. It cannot be denied but in the latter end of the former year, the wisest amongst us were under sad-apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions concerning the issue of the present troubles that were thon come, and dayly coming upon us, in regard of the Rage of the</hi> Heathen <hi>so far let loose against us, and those that were concerned in the Election of Magistrates for this present year, were ready to fear they might be speak the persons on whom the next Election should fall with the words of the prophet,</hi> Thou hast Cloathing, be thou our Ruler, and let this ruine be under thine hand. <hi>But Thanks be to Almighty God that hath verified that ancient Proverb of the Hebrews, to our late expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,</hi> Cum duplicantur lateres, hinc venit Moses: <hi>And as Israel was never brought into greater Streights then a little before</hi> Pharaoh <hi>and his Host were to be drowned in the red Sea, so hath it in a sence been with our selves.

himself, his Family, all his Kingdome in that fatal Battle on the mountains of Gilboa, But he whose sole Prerogative it is to bring good out of evill, ordered that disasterous Calamity to become an occasion to usher in the greatest prosperity that ever that Nation enjoyed either be fore or since that time. For as God when he had a purpose to exalt his people to be the Head of the Nations amongst whom they lived, and not the tayle; he infused a spirit of Counsel and Wisdome into the minds of their Leaders, Instructing them to find out the right and ready way of their future peace and tranquility; together with a spirit of Love and Obedience in the People to attend thereunto. It is a good Omen unto Israel when the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment of the Tribes falls into such hands as have</hi> Understanding in the times to know what Israel ought to doe; <hi>it will then be no hard matter to perswade their Brethren to comply with their Commands. As every season of a mans life carryes its particular dutyes along with it, so doth every age of the World bring with it particular dutyes as the work of that Generation; As it concerns every judicious Christian to know the one, so it doth every Head or Leader of the Tribes to be acquainted with the other; as also prudently to observe the fit season and peculiar manner of acting for the performing such duties upon which narrow point depends the success of al humane affairs &amp; undertakings.</hi> Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore is the misery of man great upon him, <hi>saith Solomon, i. e.</hi> Because time and Chance hapneth to them all, the sons of men that know not their times, are taken as Fishes in an evill net. <hi>If any thing be found hinted in the following Discourse, that hath any tendency that way, or may become an help thereunto, as it is all I aimed at, so shall I rest abundantly satisfied, if what it humbly offered in that kind, find favourable acceptance with your selves or others. As for the times in which, and the place where our Lot is cast: although in many respects we may say with the Psalmist,</hi> The Lines are fallen to us in pleasant places, <hi>and that we have</hi> a goodly Heritage, <hi>yet must we owne, that what with the imperfections of our minds &amp; Wills, &amp; what with many other temptations that ly before us in the work of our Generation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring therewith, we have met with a sufficient degree of affliction and trouble, enough to ballance our hearts, and keep us from being exalted above measure: yet need not this be any</hi> Remora, <hi>or hindrance unto us, in the present duty and Service we are called unto, there being no reason to be rendred why we should not walk toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Unity, Love and Peace in those things whereunto we have attained, because in some others, and possibly those of less moment, some may be otherwise minded. Concerning which minute and lesser Differences, I shall not presume here to offer any thing, tending to make the least alteration in any of your judgments, being fully perswaded that in all the main and essential matters of Religion, both of Faith and Order, as well as righteousness, you are all of one mind &amp; judgment &amp; will all both <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

which endeovours if you shall persist, it may be hoped that as hitherto God hath owned your selves, as well as your Predecessors, to become as a wall and defence to his vineyard here planted, so there may be still found of you that shall help to build the waste places, and raise up the foundations of many Generations; and that you (notwithstanding the present Combustions) shall be called the Repairers of the Breach, and the restorers of pathes to dwell in. It is possible you may be importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately molested with the clamours of these or those, to make this or that change in your course, to gratifie particular mens humours, of which you need take no more notice then the skilfull Pilot at the helme uses to doe of the cryes of the unskilfull, fearfull Passengers that think that course will ruine the vessel, which is the only way to preserve it. There is an old Fable, that when there hapned a great conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about the weather, those of the high Countryes complained that they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most burnt up with drought for want of rain, and those of the valleys said they were almost drowned for want of Sun-shining dayes: Jupiter sent them word by Mercury the weather should be as it had been. Possibly some under your Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are as ready to complain of too much restraint, as others are of too much liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I humbly conceive you cannot doe better, then to let things be as they have been heretofore,</hi> so <hi>to countenance and encourage those that fear God and work rightious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but sharply to rebu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

It is one great part of the unhappiness of this life, that neither wise nor good men are all of one mind, but yet all due care had need be taken, that differences be made neither more nor greater then they are, or carried on with such Animosity or bitterness, as should prejudice the interest of Religion, or welfare of the Commonwealth. Yea possibly the differences in our minds that occasion most disturbance arise only from that which they call <gap reason="foreign">

If God in whose hand our times are, and who sets the bounds of our habitations, shall as he hath begun, goe on to perform his while work upon his people, and send such rest unto his Churches here, that the Answer to be returned to the Messengers of the Nations shall be,</hi> The Lord hath founded our Sion, and that the poor of the people shall trust in it. <hi>How can it better be improved, them by taking care that the Churches under your care in this Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be edified, walking in the fear of God, that the Lord our God may be with us as he was with our Fathers, that he may not leave us nor forsake us, nor our Posterity after us.

that Christian Religion allows, &amp; as they grow up, to engage them through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and seriously in all the dutyes it requires; to take care that it be done by those whom it more immediately concerns, is certainly a duty in special incumbent on your selves. To this end I may commend to your Consideration, the Political Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Country, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

If he were not much mistaken who said it was morally impossible to rivet Christian Religion into the body of a nation without Infant Baptisme, by proportion it will as necessarily follow that the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect or disuse thereof, will as directly tend to root it out. How far the Command given to Joshuah by God himself to circumcise the Children of Israel,</hi> i. e. <hi>to take order that Circumcision should be used again among the people (by that means to rowl the reproach of Egypt from off the Children of Israel) may be looked upon as obliging to your selves I shall not now say, ye doubtless if what was written or hapned to them was intended as matter of example and admonition to us, upon whom the ends of the world are come, some use may and ought to be made of such Declarations of Gods will. Whatever Indulgence may be judged need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be used to some that may be of different apprehensions. I have adventured to say something in the following Discourse, for cleering the duty of Rulers in matters of Religion from mistakes, and stating the bounds of moderate Toleration (so far as the time allotted for such an exercise would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low) not so much for direction to your selves, as for the information of others who by their too much rigidness on the one hand, or laxness on the other, may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to obstruct the Churches peace, but not promote the purity of Gospel Worship,</hi> plàcidè contra sentientem ferre <hi>is no small piece of Christian prudence, the want of which I fear hath done much hurt in this poor Country, as well as in other reformed Churches. Dissenters in Religion being not much unlike the Seditious in the State, who by fair meanes may be gained, but by too much severity are apt to run into uncurable opposition and obstinacy. It must be owned for your future Honour that much hath been done by you to carry on the work of God in this Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, yet may it be feared that his words will be found too true, (a man much employed and approved by your selves, while he was conversant in this world) that unless many things were done for the further setling of the matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amongst us before this Generation went off the Stage, they that came after would have cause to say, that their Predecessors had left much of their work un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>In the words of the Text there are four things very obvious to the view of the observant Reader.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Distribution of the whole Tribe into its integral parts or consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuent Members, as to their political order, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> the Heads and the Brethren; of which two united together consisted the body of the Tribe, as is here im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The qualification of each part, fitly disposing them to a regular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the duty incumbent on either, for the good of the whole. 1. Wisdome, in those that were the Heads, described both by its specification, understanding of the times. 2. By its application, to know what <hi>Israel</hi> ought to do. 2. Willingness in the Brethren, to attend the advice and counsel of their Leaders, they were at their Commandment.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The regular and orderly proceeding of each part, the which is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily implyed in the words; that when the heads of the Tribe had coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selled and determined what was needful to be done, the Brethren were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to put their resolves in Execution. It was not in <hi>Issachar,</hi> as <hi>Anacharsis</hi> the <hi>Philosopher,</hi> sometimes complained of the tumultuous proceedings in the popular Common-wealth at <hi>Athens,</hi> that wise and grave men deliberated on things, but fools and mad men resolved thereof: but at this time in <hi>Issachar,</hi> the body of the people were ready to put in execution what those who had understanding in the times judged needful to be done.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The entire unity of the Tribe amongst themselves, declaring the unanimous consent of the whole; in that it is said, <hi>all their Brethren were at their Commandment,</hi> so at the Commandment of the two hundred which were the Heads, which doth justly advance the gallantry of the Action of the tribe of <hi>Issachar</hi> in this affair, above that of any of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Possibly many bloudy Skirmishes had also been fought during the reign of the former King within their precincts, whereby the People of this Tribe had been experimentally taught the miseries and calamities of war, that are usually produced or prolonged for want of wisdome, and skilful conduct in them that have the chief command.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gonius speaks in his Treatise of the Commonwealth of the Hebrews, one was that of the whole People, of whom first the Judges, afterward the Kings were the chief Heads and Rulers. The other was of every City, which had its Head or chief Ruler; as we read in several places of the Scripture, as Judg. 9. 30. 1 King. 22. 36. 2 Chron. 34. 8. The third was that of every Tribe, which had its Head or chief Ruler, 1 Chron. 27. 16. 2 Chron. 19 11. called the Prince or Head of the Tribe: under whom were the chief Heads or Rulers of every Family in that Tribe: For as every Tribe consisted of several Families, unto one of of which might all the descendants of that Tribe be reduced, so was some one person, either by the eminency of his Gifts, or dignity of his Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, usually advanced to be the chief Ruler, or decades of that Family, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the distribution of the People into so many Head, according to Jethro's advice, Exod. 18. 21. At this time it seems there were two hundred Heads of the chief Families of the Tribe of Issachar, in whose wisdome and integrity the rest of the Tribe had such confidence, that they were willing to refer the managing of all their civil affairs, and great concernments to their prudence and discretion, engaging themselves to be ready to put in execution what ever should by their joynt consent be determined and agreed upon. So sweet was the accord between those Heads, and their Brethren, that they seemed like one intire body, animated and directed by one and the same Spirit and Principle of life and Wisdome.</p>
            <p>That had understanding of the times:] Nothing all that Wisdome that belongs to Rulers Divine and Humane: For by times we are to understand things done in those times, by a metonimy of the adjunct. And for the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000214_0012_0FA36B2006721DB0"/>
word understanding; it is expressed by two words in the Hebrew, yet not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly translated by one, according to the use of our Language: the one seems to note the act of the mind, in way of simple apprehension: the other the act of the judgement, in way of accurate consideration dijudicating of the time and season with other circumstances, discerning when all things are laid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the ballances what doth preponderate, &amp; so most needful to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended: this expression, Esther. 1. 12. is interpreted by knowing law and judgement, and such are there called wise men; according to which notion Solomon tells us that a wise mans hearted discerneth time and judgement. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 8. 5. both the thing which, and the time when it is to be done. The Hebrew word here and elsewhere translated understanding, means the same with that which in Latine is called <hi>Prudentia</hi> or <hi>rectaratio agibilium,</hi> so knowing the right reason of things that are to be done; it cometh from &amp; hath a near cognation with a word that signifies to build. A wise man that hath any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe to bring about, is like an Architect, who first frameth in his minde an Idea of that which he purposeth to erect, whereby he may foresee how one peice must depend upon another, and accordingly provide such materials, as will bear suit together, for the carrying on his fabrick: for, as one saith well, they are not the wisest men that know most, but they that know what is most useful and proper to bring about the designe they have in hand: nor can a man be thought rightly to understand a business that doth not see through the circumstances, it is cloathed with: for many times the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances may much alter a case, oft times it cometh to pass, that those things which considered in themselves, and of their own nature seem most directly tending to such an end, yet falling in conjunction with other things, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a contrary effect. Thus are the most probable means oft disappointed, being prevented by time and chance, which they wanted wisdome to foresee, for want of which foresight great is the misery that men bring upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and others: yet is not a superficial wisdome sufficient for this purpose: many may be deceived by a plausible appearance of things, into which they have not a through insight and discerning. By a mistake of this nature Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salom and all the heads of the people that were with him ruined themselves and one another, and so were overthrown, not having understanding of the times in that juncture of affairs: The Cousel of <hi>Act it phel</hi> says <hi>Hushai</hi> is not good at this time, which in all those dayes was as the Oracle of God, and was so in that exigent, if it had been discerned by the heads of the people then present as to the design they had in hand: no doubt but at that time Davids Prayer (to which the Almighty said Amen) was to take place for the turning the Counsel of Achitophel into foolishness: but according to Men, the ruine of Absalome and his party proceeded from their not understanding of the times which made them neglect the good counsel of Achitophel, as it is called, 2 Sam. 17. 14.</p>

               </abbr> attendance unto those Rules of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and wayes of honesty, that are known by the light of nature, called <hi>jus gentium</hi> or <hi>jus naturale.</hi> But the end that Israel ought to aime at, is that men may lead a quiet life in all godliness and honesty, as Paul speaks, 1 Tim. 2. 2. which one Text were enough to confute all those that would debar civil Rulers from inter medling in matters of Religion: but how far they may and ought to interpose their authority in things of that nature, there may be occasion to speak more afterward, by Gods assistance.</p>
            <p>Otherwise it would follow, that the Magistrate is only to take care, that men may live quietly and peaceably one with another, whither they live ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly or no: but by the Apostles Rule, if the Magistrate is to take care that they may live honestly, as well as quietly and peaceably, he must in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner see that they live godlily as well as honestly: which necessarily implies, that he ought to take care for godliness, in the observation of the first Table, as well as for honesty in the observation of the second.</p>
            <p>Further also, where the end that Israel aims at may be coincident with that which is aimed at by the rest of the world, yet may not Israel take that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to compass that end, which others of the World may, at least use to do; for Israel must not do evil that good may come thereof: For as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle James saith, <hi>the wisdom that descendeth not from above is earthly, sensual &amp; devilish,</hi> such as mens ends are, such will the means be which they make use of to bring about those ends: yea oft times worldly men will make use of very evil means to bring about a good end. The Rule Israel ought to walk

by is to suffer rather then to sin: so our Saviour Christ tells his Disciples what is that custome of the Gentiles, but will not allow them so to do, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 25, 26</p>
            <p>In the particular case before Issachar, and the rest of the Tribes of Israel at this time, it was not difficult to know what they ought to do; if they did but consider the call of God in anointing David to be King, as well as the qualifying him with Royal gifts for that purpose, which considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions alone could not be counter balanced by all the allegations on the behalf of the house of S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Their Brethren were at their Commandment,] in the Hebrew, it is, they were at their mouth. The mouth being the Organ designed for the forming of words, where by to express the conceptions of the minde, it is oft put to signifie Words, or Commandments that are uttered thereby, as it is here translated in the Text. Hereby is noted the unanimity and sweet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement between the Heads and the People of this Tribe, as if one Spirit had run through the whole body thereof. An happy presage of good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess in the business they had now in hand, if the rest of the Tribes were in like manner affected, as is very probable they were in a great measure. This Spirit of unity and obedience, being most exemplarily found in this Tribe of Iss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>char: the strength also of their courage and resolution is necessarily implied here: as if they were ready to adventure their lives in whatever service they might be put upon, like the Souldiers of the Centurion in the Gospel, who were always ready to come, or to go, or to do whatsoever their Commander should put them upon. If any should ask, whither the knowledge of what Israel ought to do, is intended of the Heads of the Tribe only, or of the Brethren also? I answer, of both, according to due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion: that which the Heads of the Tribe advised unto, was apprehended by their Brethren as most behooful for their several good, accordingly they are with meet courage and resolution of minde ready to put the same in execution. Guidance belongs to their Leaders, Obedience to their followers, whose wisdome it is to obey rather then dispute the Commands of their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours.</p>

The like is necessary to be observed in the rational and political World, where persons of differing endowments and qualifications need a differing station to be disposed into, the keeping of which, is both the beauty and strength of such a Society. Naturalists tell us that beauty in the body arises from an exact symmetry or proportion of contrary humours, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mixed one with an other: so doth an orderly and artificial distribution of diverse materials, make a comely Building, while homogeneous bodyes (as the depths of waters in the Sea, and heaps of sand on the Shore) run into confused heaps, as bodyes uncapable to maintain an order in themselves. So that it appears, whoever is for a parity in any Society, will in the issue reduce things into an heap of confusion.

The poor and the needy might starve with hunger and cold, were they not fed with the morsells, and warmed with the fleece of the wealthy. Is it not found by experience, that the greatest part of mankind, are but as tools and Instruments for others to work by, rather then any proper Agents to effect any thing of themselves: In peace how would most people destroy themselves by slothfulness and security? In war they would be destroyed by others, were it not for the wisdome and courage of the valliant.

No wonder therefore that when the people of Israel were ready, instead of punishing the disorder and rebellion of Corah, and his company, to countenance the business, God himself steps in to quiet the Tumult, and by Moses his mouth tells the present offenders, and in them all others of the like stamp, that at they would make an innovation in the camp, so he himself would make a new thing in the earth, that it should open its mouth, and at once, without any further tryal or delay, swallow down and devour those presumptuous offenders, that had attempted to violate the order God himself had so newly established in the Camp. Behold ye dispisers of order and Government, and wonder, that God whose glory it is to be stiled, long-suffering, Patient and slow to wrath, is so quick in punishing this sin, as to prevent any future hope of mercy be Repentance, to those so notorious breakers of Order.

formed out of the dust, as the Poet speaks, <hi>Os homini sublime dedit</hi>—The Architect of that curious piece hath placed the Head in the fore-front, and highest sphear, where are lodged all the senses, as in a Watch-Tower, ready to be improved upon all occasions, for the safety and preservation of the whole. There are placed those that look out at the windows, to foresee evil and danger approaching, accordingly to alarm all the other inferiour powers, to take the signal and stand upon their guard for defence of the whole.

Thus are all orders wont to be dispatched and issued from the Cinque ports of the senses in, and about the head, for the benefit and advantage of the whole body. Very fitly therefore in the body politick are the rulers by way of allusion called Heads. And in case of inability to discharge those functions, such societies may not undeservedly be compared to the <hi>Palmists</hi> Idols, that have eyes but see not, and have ears but hear not.

Therefore we find, that when <hi>Solomon,</hi> after he was advanced to be the chief Head and Leader of Israel, when he had his Option granted him of God, could not ask any thing so well pleasing to God, and so needful to himself, as wisdome, or an understanding heart to judge the Israel of God, and to discerne between good and bad.

So great mischiefs oft times do attend the want of understanding to know what Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael ought to do. Rehoboam also and his people did both strangely ruine themselves by a contrary extream in this kind, in not understanding of the times to know what they ought to do, to avoid the danger which either of them feared. The King was afraid of being mated by his Subjects, puts on a garb of greater Majesty then was usual in his countenance and words, at that time, when a condescending carriage, with more mildness and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness had been more necessary, and in all probability, had saved both his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and his Kingdome: on the other side, the people acted by the same fatal and precipitant counsels of rash and unadvised persons, to avoid the heavy yoke of the house of David, as they conceived, advanced one of the Servants of their former Kings, whose little finger proved indeed (as the other proudly speaks) heavier then the loyns of the two former Kings: for the Kingdome was not able to stand long under the weight thereof, but was soon crushed and ruined by the tyrany of the succeeding Kings of the ten Tribes.

In the present exigent before us in the Text; the case appeared difficult a good while. There was Abner the Captain of the Host of Israel, with the Son and Heir of the former King, engaged on the one side; David and a few of his Servants and followers on the other; yet to these that had understanding of those times, it doth at the last manifestly appear what Israel ought to do. Saul had outed himself of the Kingdome, by asking counsel of the Devil how to continue it in his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who were therefore justly rejected of God; David was by a special man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date from God chosen to be King in his stead, which Ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

unto David, not only in regard of ability and fitness, but also in point of right and title, as being the person designed of God for them to choose; yet is it something long before the people are willing to understand it. Though wisdome be alwayes too high for a fool, as Solomon speaks, yet in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est times that ever befel the Israel of God, they that will do the will of God may by inquiry, study and prayer come to know what it is. However it doth hereby appear of how great concernment it is, for the Heads in Israel to know what Israel ought to do, least otherwise they be drawn to do, that which in Israel ought not to be done. Gideon was a wise man, that judged Israel with great approbation of God and man, yet out of a superstitious conceit, will needs make an Ephod, which thing ought not to have been done in Israel, what followed? All Israel went a whoring after it, and so it became a snare to himself in his family, and to Israel also.</p>
            <p>The body of a people are not much unlike the body of waters, which are not apt to move of themselves, if let alone in their own receptacle, but as they receive an impression from a forreign Element, or a power that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them: and things that are soft and flexible are susceptible of divers, yea contrary impressions. David by an insinuating and melting speech bowed the hearts of all the men of Israel as one man. They that have such interest in them, had need know what they ought to do, seeing they may make them do almost what pleaseth themselves that are their Rulers: for Absolom had bowed them as well as David, though it were the wrong way. All mens hearts are not in their own keeping, wise men can easily find keys that will open the Cabinet and take away the Treasure; for tis said, Absalom stole a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the hearts of the men of Israel. Thus in things of the greatest mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is easie for Princes, and Leaders, and Heads of the Tribes to draw them that are their bones and their flesh, as David speaks to be of their mind and to engage in their quarrel, be it right or wrong. Many Instances of the like kind may be given out of prophane as well as Sacred Hystory, for the sea of examples of this nature is withous bottome, whereby it will be found most evident, that those who are the Heads and Leaders of any people may easily engage, them in their own quarrels to their ruine and destruction, as often as otherwise.</p>
            <p>Thus did Jeroboam, Ahah, Jehu and others perswade the people of Israel, after their own example, to embrace the abominable idolatry of the Calves which brought inevitable and fatal ruine upon the whole Kingdome of the ten Tribes, as well as upon their owne families. Cato was wont to say of the people of Rome, (and it is as true of any other sort of people) that they were like sheep, in that it was easier to drive or lead a whole flock or multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of them, then any one single creature amongst them, By all which Considerations it is manifest that things are no where like, so successfully to

be carryed on as where they who are concerned in the leading of Church or state, have such understanding of the times, as to know what Israel ought to doe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third thing considerable in this unparalleld pattern of civill poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is <hi>the unity of their Counsels.</hi> That which in this juncture of affairs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us in the text, was apprehended as most meet for Israel to doe, is by the joynt advice and counsel of the heads of this tribe propounded, and by the whole body of the people consented unto, and approved, such a rare pattern of unity is seldome found in our times. Let a body politick be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so well proportioned, as to its constitution, and form of government, &amp; never so well furnished with wise and able men for its conduct and guidance, yet if the several members be not well tuned together, by a spirit of love and unity, there will never be any good harmony in their Administrations. Where the whole multitude is not of one heart, and of one mind, as was said of them in the <hi>Acts. Chap</hi> 4. 32. there will appear little beauty or strength, and no success in any of their motions. In the beautifull System of the world, which yet is compounded of sundry Elements, and those of differing qualityes one from the other, yet is there such a necessary and mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection between the parts, that they are all so firmly knit one to another, that it is altogether impossible to make any breach in their union: rather will those several bodies forget the propertyes of their own nature, then there shall be any <hi>Chasma</hi> or <hi>Vacuum</hi> amongst them, which would tend to a dissolution of the whole. Thus in the body politick, where it is animated with one entire spirit of love and unity, and setled upon lasting and sure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of quietness and peace, all the several members, must and will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire together to deny, or forbear the exercise of their own proper incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, to preserve the union of the whole; that there be no Schisme in the body, as the Apostle speaks: Therefore where the higher bodyes in Church or state, cannot descend (and that of their own voluntary inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without forcible compulsion) and the lower and grosser ones cannot ascend up to meet the other, any man may easily read the destiny of such a society, It had been much better for Rehoboam to have denyed himself, and become the servant of his people, and subjects for that one day, rather then to have made them his enemies, if not his lords (for they were the greater Kingdome) for ever after. David was forced to yield to as much as that came to, if not something more, when he complains, the sons of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> are too hard for him, rather then to make a breach between himself &amp; his men of warr, in that difficult time, when himself was yet weak, and the Kingdome not firmly or fully setled in his hand. David was wise as an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of God, to know what he had to doe; and doth not connive at their sin, although he doth for that time forbear to execute the punishment, leaving
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000214_0024_0FA36CF2883C1BC8"/>
things to a more convenient season. Jerusalem, sayes the Psalmist, is buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as a city that is compact together: when the parts of a building are so artificially framed one into another, that they are as it were cemented, and knit together by a vital spirit of love, the more weight is laid upon them, the firmer and stronger they grow: but where they are disjoynted, one part helps to weaken, and overthrow the other. Cyrus is said to have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown the impregnable city of Babylon, by drawing the great channel of Euphrates, into several small rivulets, which, had they continued in one main stream, he could never have done. It is not the storms and tempests, though never so boisterous, while they are on the outside, or upon the surface of the earth, that make any commotion therein, but the vapors that are insensibly gotten into its bowels, that make it quake and tremble. It is not the outward force and violence that ruines a commonwealth, so much as a spirit of division, and contention arising from jealousies, prejudices, &amp; animosityes from within themselves, which doth most dangerously threaten, and most certainly foretell its destruction, as our Saviour himself speaks, an <hi>An house or Kingdome divided against it self cannot stand.</hi> The swift ships that are driven by the fierce winds, or carryed with the raging waves of the sea, yet so long as they who sit at their helmes are united, in their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels and endeavours, most commonly do avoid the danger of ship-wrack, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing turned this or that way, upon occasion, at the will of the governour, but if they who are to manage them cannot agree amongst themselves, they may easily be emersed, and whole navies of them become but <hi>ludibrium Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum.</hi> Unity of Counsell is one of the chief foundations of civill Polity: But if the foundations be dissolved, what can the righteous doe? but mourn in secret, when they foresee, but cannot prevent the miseryes that are coming upon a factious, divided and self-destroying people. It was a sad time in Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael when one half of the people followed Tib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Or else my endanger the ruine of the whole, as too often hath been seen in the world, that when lesser societyes have been divided amongst themselves, they have but the sooner become a prey to a stronger power. Which if it had not been experienced in most of the states, and societyes of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world, and in all the latter, as well as ancient revolutions of the nations, where any order of Government, either civill or ecclesiastical hath been esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, might have been exemplifyed by particular instances. <hi>Foelix quem faciunt &amp;c.</hi> happy are they that can take warning by the harms they have observed in preceding times. Such divisions, especially in the Church of God, are in a great measure to be ascribed to the policy of Satan, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours by all wayes and meanes to foment divisions, amongst those of the

Church, by that course to ruine them, while in the mean time, he provides for the quiet of his own Kingdome, the world, God also may be said to do it, being provoked by the pride and tyranny, with other wickedness of the sons of men, judicially to mingle a perverse spirit in the midst of a nation, &amp; suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their princes to be deceived, and to deceive their people, as the prophet speaks of Egypt. Isa. 19. 13, 14. Causing them to erre in every work thereof as a drunken man staggereth in his vomit. But the meritorious and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring cause of those ruinous and destructive counsells arises from the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or wickedness of a people themselves: It being observed as one of the blessings God was pleased to cast in to some heathen states, as a reward of their wisdome and prudence, with other moral virtues, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> their long peace, and flourishing prosperity upon the earth. It is much to consider, that all Asia can agree together in the worship of a Diana, and the Image that fell down from Jupiter, while one single Church in the city of Corinth cannot long hold together in the worship of the true God, nor retain the rites of his worship, and the me regular use of the sacred bodyes of love and unity, without such shamefull divisions, and scandalous breaches, as they are sharply rebuked for by the Apostle, in both his Epistles to that Church, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting the root of those divisions to the lusts of the flesh, <hi>Are ye not carnal, and walk as men?</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 3.</p>
            <p>But this being a matter of so great concernment for the good and welfare of Societyes whither Christian of civill, it may not be amiss to enquire into the true grounds and seasons of such Unity, or the way how it may be brought about. The first and principal is, a clear discovery of the right way of their peace and prosperity, it being taken for granted, that this is, or ought to be the end that all Societyes generally ayme at, <hi>sc.</hi> a quiet pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of what they already have, with enlargement of their prosperity, if attainable, But if there be no agreement in the meanes that seem most di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to tend to that end, but that apprehensions are divided about that, they may be as much divided for ever: For at this time, and a little before, the Israelites were taken with a fond desire of a Kingly Government, yet not being at an agreement amongst themselves about the person, or the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his Goverment, they were divided into factions till their mind by sad experience came to be convinced, that David was the person, not only called, but qualified of God for that great service. which Amasa expresses in the name of the rest of the Tribes, Thine are we David, and on thy side thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>on of Jesse; so that nothing can be supposed more directly to tend to the creating and maintaining, unity in the counsells and affections of a people, then cleer convincing light, and a demonstrative evidence, that what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, is the direct and proper meanes to bring about the end generally aymed at; otherwise, it will be said <hi>Soinditur incertum studia in contraria vulgus</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:000214_0026_0FA36CF4110BC118"/>
The poor man by his wisdome, saith Solomon, delivered the city. And the wise woman of Abel saved the city by propounding so meet an expedient, as gained acceptance in all apprehensions. Otherwise it may fall out as Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-saith, <hi>Ec.</hi> 10. 15. <hi>the labour of the foolish wearyeth every one of them, for they know not how to find the way to the city.</hi> Where wisdome is wanting to direct mens actions, labour will be endless, &amp; the issue mischief, or disappointment at the best. When once the people of Rome were ready to mutiny upon a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel that fell out between the Citizens of the higher, and those of the lower ranke, Menippus healed the breach by a wise <hi>Apologus</hi> of the contention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ily, and the members in the body natural, which carryed such a convincing evidence along with it, that all partyes at variance were soon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed about the way of their own welfare. The like wise <hi>medium</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by Jotham, in the ninth of Judges, but it could not be attended, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God had sent an evill spirit amongst them, as the text there speaks.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The mutual interest that the members of the same Society have in the affections of each other, gives great advantage to promote this Unity, if duly considered. There was no small argument in the words of Abram used to Lot, <hi>Let not us fall out, for we are Brethren.</hi> Nature leaves a strange instinct upon those of the same kind, even amongst the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> creatures to defend one another, and to revenge the injury done to their owne kind: such incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations use to work more strongly with those that are endued with reason. The joynt interest of people in the same family, nation or religion, tends much this way: Joab could not have used a more pathetical argument to his brother Ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>shai, then the mention of <hi>[our people, and the cityes of our God]</hi> whereby to engage him to magnanimous combate with the common enemy; as also the promise of mutual assistance each to other, and no doubt the preceding exhortation to magnanimity took the firmer hold on either of their hearts, to consider their neer relation each to other. David enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges much on this account. <hi>For my Brethren and Companions sake, I will now say peace be within thee,</hi> Psal. 122. 8. On the other hand, when the minds of persons are either leavened with pride, or discontented, or their spirits im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittered with Jealousies or prejudices against each other, it cannot but much hinder this desired Unity. When the envy of Ephraim, and the vexing of Judah shall cease one toward another <hi>Isa</hi> 11. 13. they may the more easily subdue all other of their enemies.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This comes to pass by the prudent and condescending behaviour of those that are leaders of others, who by their discreet behaviour may doe much to maintain Love and unity in Societyes, for want of which oft times it is miserably lost. <hi>The soft answer pacifieth wrath, and the soft tongue breaketh the bone,</hi> saith Solomon. Gideon by a mild and gentle answer prevented a quarrel betwixt him and the Ephraemites, which afterwards upon the like

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ah. David bowed the hearts of all the men of Israel as one man, by an insinuating speech as by his discreet behaviour in former times he won the hearts of all Souls servants, not withstanding that inveterate prejudice, envy and malice of their master against him. <hi>Duro con duro non sat bon muro,</hi> say the Italians; <hi>a firm wall will not be made up of hard stones,</hi> without the mixture of some more yielding matter to cement them together. That may easily be drawn by love, that will not be driven by a mighty force. The rigor of a Command may be much sweetned by the gentleness of the expression. Paul, though now the aged, will rather for loves sake beseech, or intreat a favour of Philemon, then enjoyne a duty. Moses his calling the Israelites Rebells, was more like to increase the Rebellion of their wills against God, then any way alter that evill disposition of their minds. Jobs peremptory adjuring of David, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in that exigent, it gained the present end he aimed at, yet it for ever after lost his interest in his Sovereigns heart, the harshness of the words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing harder to be digested then the matter contained in them. Many times also the difficulty of a message is much sweetned by the courteous disposition of them that bring it, as the third messenger sent by the king of Israel to Elijah, seems to find by experience. Rehoboams yoke had not seemed so intollerable, if it had with more gentle words been imposed; wherefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing kings chuse rather to express their non-assent to the demands of their subject, by an <hi>Adviserable Roy,</hi> then by an harsh and absolute refusal. When Themistocles once told the Adriens, to whom he was sent to demand tribute, that he would bring two mighty Gods to overcome them, Love and Eloquence, it was replyed to him, that they had two mighter then they, <hi>sc</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and impossibility, or else very probably the other might easily have prevailed. This way of procuring unity and peace is as much seen in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, as in things of another nature, where as a late Author truly saith, by passionate, hot and eager Disputes peace is alwayes lost, and truth is seldome or never found.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the fourth and last place, This is brought about by the influence and assistance of Divine Grace, so disposing the wills and affections of men that unity and peace are thereby both procured and preserved. For if God be provoked to send an evil Spirit, as he did betwixt the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo, the wisest Counsels shall not prevail, is at that time was delivered them by Jotham a very fage <hi>Apologus,</hi> yet it could not prevent that wicked conspiracy between the men of Shechem, and Ab melech, for God had purposed by that means to punish them both, so that a mutual fire is kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, whereby the men of Shechem &amp; the house of Millo are devoured; one by another: when a mans ways please the Lord, his very Enemies shall be at peace with him, much more easie it is to expect that such may obtain peace one with
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:000214_0028_0FA36CF588806C10"/>
another when God is stiled the God of love and peace, it is therein implyed not only that he is the approver of those Blessings, but the Author and Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of them. It was prophecied of Solomons Reign, that there should be an abundance of Peace, and so it was fulfilled, till God stird him up Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, which put an end to his peace: So as if God will give a Commission to any Instruments, to take away peace from this or that part of the Earth, it may not be expected, to continue longer there; for he will either mingle a perverse spirit amongst their Counsellors, as was threatned to Egypt, or hide the Counsels of peace from the eyes of the People, or their Leaders, whence they may be dashed together to their mutual destruction and ruine.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The fourth and last thing considerable in this exact pattern of a civil state, is the height of their courage and resolution. It is a sign of great prosperity and success in any enterprises, when the Brethren are valiant and resolute in the execution, as their Leaders are wise in their conduct. That obedience to the commands of their Superiours, is intended in a great measure, in the Text, I deny not, but what might be required here of that nature, may be gathered from what was said under the Head of order, treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of in the first place. In this place therefore I shall confine my self, only to that of their courage and resolution, which though in the last place to be spoken to, yet is not the least thing considerable in a flourishing state: for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise through the cowardize and slothfulness of a people with other vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces attending thereon, after ages may easily lose all that riches, wealth and honour, which the wisdome and valour of the preceding have obtained: as may be seen in the dayes of the Judges that succeeded Joshuah, and of the Kings that succeeded David and Solomon. Hyram concludes the prosperity of Israel from the wisdome of David, and Solomon his successour; to be sure, when wise Leaders are attended with valiant people, it is easie to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell the prosperity of such a nation. The very name of David and his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty men that were with him, though weary and weak-handed (as Achicophel wisely suggested) was enough to fright Absolom and all the men of Israel from pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>suing their advantage: I shall here therefore take occasion to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course somewhat of that eminent vertue, so necessary for the flourishing of a people, disposed into a well ordered polity. Valour is an inward virtue of the minde enabling us to persist in our duty not withstanding the difficulty or danger thereof. They are not a little mistaken, that think nothing is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to valour, but a daring confidence to fight. <hi>ut non poena martyrem, sie nec pugna fortem, sed causa facit.</hi> It is a lawful striving as the Apostle tells us, that deserves the Garland, we must know therefore, that there are four in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients necessary to the constitutioo of a valiant minde.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The first is magnanimity, or greatness of mind, when the Spirit is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to such a degree of courage, as not to stoop to low, and mean things
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:000214_0029_0FA36CF648C1B6E8"/>
though it should be to compass some seeming great adventage. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> was the commendation of the worthies of God, that they accepted not of deliverance, <hi>st.</hi> upon low and base terms, which may be imposed by Adversaries. Paul will rather dy then make his glorying void: a valiant mind will rather lay down his life then keep it upon dishonourable terms. If the men of Jabesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Gilead, or Ahab afterwards, had accepted of their lives or peace, upon the ignominious tearms offered by the supposed Conquerer, it had been a thing unworthy of the Israel of God. Nor will Nehemiah lose his honour, as he was Governour, by fleeing to save his life in an hiding place of security. So neither doth Christian humility require a man to stoop to any thing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming his Faith and Profession. Paul that can yield to any thing for the honour of God, and good of others, yet will yield to nothing, nor give place for an house to them that will lay a snare for their liberty. And in another case of a civil nature, the same Apostle, although no Souldier, but of Christ Jesus, stands upon his honour, and the priviledge of his freedome, when he is not fairly treated according to the dignity of a Roman. Is it lawful to scourge a Rom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n? such was Pauls humility as an Apostle of Jesus Christ, that he can be content to receive forty stripes of his own Nation, yet hath so much magnanimity that he will not yield to receive one of an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, where he hath a civil right to plead an exemption. Such magnanimity becomes the Israel of God, as was said of Gideons Brethren, that each one should resemble the Children of a King. If it be said, that in such a case a man can do no other good, then to shew his will; it may be said, <hi>in magnis voluisse sat est,</hi> in matters of great moment, it is enough if a man shews but the resolution of his mind.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A second ingredient, is Confidence or boldness, not to be afraid of the danger or evil supposed, though it should be death it self. It seemed Joab and Ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er were followed with valiant men, when they can so readily lay down their lives, at the command of their Captains. The Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous are bold as a Lyon, saith Solomon, not afraid of danger, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so great, either felt or feared. David will not be afraid though an Host should encamp against him, Psal. 27. 3. Fear is an embondaging affection but the true Israel of God are called unto liberty; therefore it becomes not them through the fear of death to be subject unto bondage: it was a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble spirit of valour that discovered it self in that English Captain, under his King in France, who being sent to discover the Enemies Camp, and his num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, was no whit discouraged (by the great disproportion that might be observed betwixt themselves and the enemy) but returned this answer, That there was a very great many of them, enough to kill, enough to take Prisoners, and enough to run away besides, all which came to pass soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, according to his confident presage. There hath been an extraordinary
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:000214_0030_0FA36CF7081CDFB0"/>
spirit of Courage, that some of Gods people have been endued withal, when Gods Spirit was said to come upon them, as upon Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>Judg.</hi> 14. 15. when he met a Lyon, and Judg. 15. 14. 8. when he smote the Philistines hip and thigh, and David, when he engaged with Goliah, or Jonathan and his Armor-bearer engaging against the Philistines, and undertaking a whole Garrison of them at once. Thus when the Spirit of God doth in any eminent manner excite and stir up, or actuate that innate valour of their minds, they are and will be enabled to do great things. Many a mans courage would serve him to fight very valiantly were he but assured to come off with victory or success, at least without loss of life: but true valour argues such a confidence of mind, as enables a man to look Death in the face in cold blood, as we use to say, and not to be daunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the countenance of that King of Terrour. As was seen in Joab, 2 Sam. 10. 12. who is resolved to behave himself valiantly, leaving the issue and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess to God, to do what should seem good in his sight. Why should not every true Israelite having the same cause, the same spirit of Faith, the same promises, have experience of the same courage and confidence of minde in their measure.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the third place, Patience is also requisite, enabling them quietly to bear with all the evils they may meet with by reason of the diuturnity of the Act. If thou faint in the day of adversity, faith Solomon, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 10. thy strength is but small. It is observable, that God never brought about any great matter of moment, for the salvation of his people, but he calld the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments therein to the exercise of great patience before it were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished; so that in their experiences, they must say, <hi>Qui cupit optatam oursu—Multa tulit fecito; &amp;c.</hi> At Israels first coming out of Egypt, God would not carry them by the way of the Spyes, though that was nigh, (a Journey of a few dayes) lest they should faint and be discouraged when they see war. And as afterward God would try Gideons Army, before he would call them forth to war; for when that Generation that came out of Egypt upon tryal, manifested such untractibleness and impatience under the hazard and difficulties of war, God saw meet to lay them wholly aside, and train up their posterity by degrees to inure and accustome them to bear the difficulties and hazards thereof. Amongst Davids small number that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him while he was at Ziglag, one third part tis said, was so faint, that they could not go over the Brook Bezor, but they were not denied their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual proportion in the spoile, which shewd their tarrying behind proceeded not from the want of valour in their minds, but from weakness in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which are but <hi>jumenta,</hi> or <hi>vehicula animorum:</hi> so that patience under evil, is very necessary for a Souldier.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the last place Perseverance, whereby we endure unto the end. This
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:000214_0031_0FA36CF7C88CB0B0"/>
is a law in the civil as well as spiritual combate, that there must be holding out to the end, without which the Crown is not to be expected. It was one part of the <hi>Sacr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>entum militare,</hi> by which the Roman Souldiers were wont to be listed of old, not only that they should not be unwilling to dye for the Common-wealth, and engage to do whatever their Emperour should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but that they should never forsake the Camp while there was need of their service. And to this principle was all their success in their Wars to be ascribed: that they were unwearied therein, of whom it was truly said, that though they were <hi>sapius in proelio, unnquam in bello victi;</hi> though they lost many Battels, yet their valour was so great, that they would never yield to adversity. Moses will not allow the two Tribes and an half to fit still after their own inheritance was cleared of the Enemy, till they had also helped to put their Brethren into the possession of theirs, Numb. 32. 6. And in the 78 Psalm, the Psalmist complains of the Children of Ephraim, that they turned back in the day of Battel, like a broken bow. A true spirit of valour will alwayes stand bent to the same mark, not deceiving those that trust thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. The courage of Davids mind held good after his body grew faint and weak, whereby we see that perseverance is the property of a valiant minde, as well as confidence or patience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Application.</hi> These four Considerations premised, offer a seasonable word of Advice to every one that is come hither this day. As John the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist was furnished from that measure of heavenly wisdome he was endued with, to give a satisfying answer to several that came to him with this questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>What shall we do? Luke.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 12, 14. So may any wise Scribe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed to the Kingdome of God, from this text be supplyed to give an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to every person here present, and met together upon this solemn occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that shall enquire, what they shall doe, in reference to the business be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us: I presume there is none here present, but will be found in one of these three capacityes, either of an Elector, or one elected, or a Subject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the charge of those who are like to be continued in, or chosen to the office of an Head or Ruler in this our tribe. each one may from the premises, hear something spoken unto him in the language of that Capacity wherein he stands before the Lord this day.</p>
            <p>For order sake, I shall in the first place address my self to speak unto you that are met here as Electors. There was joy in Israel when the Tribes were now met together to establish the Kingdome in the hands of David, as is said in the last verse of this Chapter. By proportion this day was wont to be a joyfull day unto us, being as it were the solemnizing of the Birth-day of our little State, the renewall of our Goverment, with all our civill priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. The Advice I shall present you with at this time is by way of Caution in the words of the Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 13. You are now called to the exercise
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:000214_0032_0FA36CF8897A4CD0"/>
of your civill Liberty (wherein <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of your other libertyes are bound up) Use not your liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love to serve one another. Those that doe but seriously consider, how much the honour of God, as well as their own good and welfare is concerned in the regular, and conscientious proceeding in this business of Election, cannot but have a solemn awe upon their hearts in this work, and judge that the putting a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity upon the grandeur of the day, is the least part of the service thereof. I might here minde you, that although it uses to be accounted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the highest civill priviledges a people can enjoy, to have the liberty to choose their owne Rulers, and not to be imposed upon in that kinde; yet if this matter be not carefully looke unto, so as to be both prudently and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enciously carryed on, it may become an occasion of the greatest bondage; as had been too sadly verefied almost in all the elective states and kingdoms in the world. The fatal instance of Absalom makes it appear, how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>asie a matter it is to court a well meaning people into such a false conceit of liberty, as may end in the ruine both of Electors and Elected. As was seen in the person forementioned, as in Abimeloch and his Tribe long before. For they were upon the Election of a King. Certainly if they were accounted cursed deceivers, that having a male in their flock, shall vow and offer to the Lord a corrupt thing. <hi>Mal</hi> 1. 14. what may we think of them this being called live often of their Brethren with the supream po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Rule &amp; Government, (an act of the highest service for the glory of God &amp; good of men) shall be so far swayed with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>action or prejudice, or byassed with self interest, or other corrupt ends, as to choose persons to such a service, as are neither approved of God, nor acceptable to wise men; or in their choise to overlook &amp; lay aside those that are, I mean not to attend the directions given by God himself, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18 27. <hi>Able men fearing God &amp;c.</hi> Yea it is expresly commanded them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 15. <hi>Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee whom the Lord thy God shall chuse:</hi> whom is God said to chuse, but those whom he hath not only called but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

What ever strange concurrence might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served at the person of Saul, between the rashness of the people to inforcing Samuel to the present choyce of a king, and the rashness of the king in most of his enterprises (which proved a bad Omen from his first anoynting) whereby <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

I will not here ingage in any dispute whither it it be either necessary, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for a free people to use their liberty in oft changing their Magistrates or chief Rulers. Concerning inferiour Officers, such as are Fiscalls &amp; Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers, whose places (by reason of the profit they usually are attended with) are more liable to temptation &amp; corruption, there is no matter of danger in their charge. Wise Hannibal, while he was Pretor at Carthage, got an Act from the Senate for the changing of such great Officers every year, having observed how ready they were all to hold together to the obstruct on of justice, and oppression of the people. But for the supream Rulers, of whom one sayes well, that <hi>

               </gap>d in often changing of them. Another speaks to the same purpose, That unless a Countrey be very full of skilfull and expert men, by often changing their Rulers, the Goverment will fall into the hands of rude and ignorant Mechanicks. But where the wisdome of any Countrey hath by long experience, seen cause to continue the same Rulers, they had need be well advised, that should promote any innova<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>o, especially in any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Juncture of affairs: It cannot but be dangerous to put the helm into the hands of an unexperienced Pilot in a tempestuous or stormy season. In such cases it is most an end found true, as the Spaniards say, the evill that is present, is better then the good that is to come. for so many times a small inconvenience and infirmity, is charged into an unsufferable evill. The people of Israel, no doubt would soon have found the little singer of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soloms vices, heavier then the loynes of all Davids infirmityes. It was good Counsell which a wise man of Capua once gave his fellow Citizens, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they cut off the old Senators, they should find new ones that were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to place in their room, which when upon tryal they were not able to doe, they were easily perswaded to continue the former in place. Let wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and knowledge be found in our Electors, as well as in our elected Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and that will be the stability of our times, and the strength of Salvation. Our Election is the foundation of our Government. A small and inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable error in the Foundation, may put the whole Building much out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. As in the body natural, a defect in the first concection is seldome help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the second, so will it be found in the body politick. And in all ages, such as are the Rulers, such will be the people both in Church and state. Therefore how doth it concern those that have an oppertunity in their hands, not only to keep it, but to improve it and manage it aright, for the upholding and maintaining good order and discipline, both in Church and State; For if I mistake no, any man may make both a true prognostick, &amp; diagnostick of the athletick State of your people, through the whole order of your Goverment, both eccleastical and civill, by your Elections, and the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:000214_0034_0FA36CFA0991DFF8"/>
quality of the persons you chuse into places of trust, be they Superiours or Inferiours; in things sacred as well as civill.</p>
            <p>I am bold to speak the more on this hand, that I might imprint upon all your minds, that are any way concerned in Election, a conscientious care of your duty, and faithfull discharge of the trust committed to you. It was one of the last requests that Moses made unto the God of the Spirits of all flesh, just as he was ready to resign up his charge, that a man might be set over the Congregation, which might both goe in and out before them, that the Congregation of the Lord be not as sheep that have no sheheard, <hi>Num.</hi> 17. 16, 17. Lest they should thereby be left to wander every one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his owne immagination, and so degenerate into corrupt and foolish wayes to their owne destruction. I am not ignorant that the lot of this dayes Election is in a great part cast into the lap, the disposal thereof from the Lord we expect to know by and by: but I speak for the future, and in way of caution to take heed to our Elections, for our (<hi>All</hi>) depends upon it. It was a sad presage of evill times approaching upon Jerusalem, when the people were driven to such miserable shifts, as to shrowd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themselves under the skins of unmeet persons, only for the sake of meat and clothing. <hi>Isai.</hi> 3. 6, 7. for they are the things left requisite in him who is called to be an Healer, <hi>A poor and wise child, is better then an old and foolish King,</hi> saith Solomon, <hi>Eccless</hi> 4. 12. And for a man to be put into the Priests office, not qualified thereunto, only to eat a morsel of bread, may prove a curse to the place, and people, as well as to that person, as was pronounced against the Family of Eli, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 36.</p>
            <p>If any should here expect that a character should here be given, how to judge of such men as may be accounted meet to be heads or leaders of Israel, the text is a full description, such as have understanding of the times to know what Israel ought to doe, and they who are such doe discover themselves, or may be distinguished from others by these qualifications.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The fear of the Lord, and the love of Righteousness. <hi>The fear of the Lord is the beginning</hi> or chief part <hi>of wisdome</hi> as the text tells us. He that is not wise for himself or for his owne soul, will never be wise for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth. They, that are not of Israel, will not much care to know what Israel ought to doe. David that was a companion of them that fear the Lord, is easily induced to seek he good of all such, <hi>Psal.</hi> 122 8. What Plato said of Philosophers, we may say of the men that fear God, (which is the best wisdome) who wished that they were the only kings, or that kings were only such. David, owned by God himself to be a man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his own heart, was the standard by which his Successors were mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured: amongst whom you will find, that to doe that which was right, was rather a diminution then otherwise, unless it could be added, with a perfect
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:000214_0035_0FA36CFAC83B4CC0"/>
heart, as did David his father. So, as to know or doe that which is right, unless it were out of integrity of their hearts, and conformity to the mind of God, doth not in Gods account denominate a man wise or one that knows what Israel ought to do. God may make use of the common gifts of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> or natural endowments of men unsanctifyed for the good of his people &amp; of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten doth when the Goverment is by providence unavoid by devolved upon them, but it may be questioned, whether a people can expect a blessing under Rulers of their own voluntary choyce, whose prey may upon certain &amp; good grounds be suspected, or denied, whatever their other qualifications may be.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Humane Learning in conjunction with the former. Such as by the benefit of natural parts Experience, Education, and study, have advantage above others to be acquainted with the affairs of the world abroad, as well as with the Laws and Customes of their own people at home. For seing persons of that alloy have generally the chief managing of affairs in other Nations, as much of that as may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, cannot but be necessary for the better ordering the affairs of Israel. It was no doubt some advantage to the officers of Hezekiah, in their treating the messengers of the Assyrian, that they understood the Syrian tongue as well as their owne. It may be presumed that no man, unless a Weigelian Sceptick, ever did account Moses less fit to be a Leader unto Israel because he was learned in all the wisdome of the Egyptians, a man mighty in words and in deeds. Nor Paul the less fit to be an Apostle, because he spake with tongues more than all the rest of the Apostles. Yea it appears that upon that account he is called a chosen Vessel, the better qualifyed to be a Doctor to the Gentiles. And if Jeptah had not had understanding of the times, <hi>sc.</hi> the knowledge of things done in forepassed times, as well as in the present, it may well be questioned whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had been so fit to have been an head of the Gleadites as afterward he proved: if he had not been able to have disputed with arguments of reason, as well as weapons of warr, he could not have managed the quarrel so successfully as he did. The chief Leaders of Israel before the Kings, were called Judges, <hi>a potiori parte;</hi> though the chief part of their work usually was to be Captains of their warrs, yet they received their title from their power of Judging, which certainly required skill and knowledge of the Lawes, by which they were to judge, which how well it could be attained without help of humane learning I doe not understand. It was well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by an officer of State to a Nobleman, that made small account of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the education of his son, (aiming at no higher learning then to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ride an horse, or fly an hawks) that if it were so, then Noble mens Sons must be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p n="3">3. Constancy or readiness is another property of a wise man; at least of one fit to be a Leader of others. Not but that a wise man may sometimes

change his mind, and his wisdome may lead him so to do. Sometimes we say, <hi>

            <p>Moderation is another property of wisdome, for if peace and truth be the best end, that all ought to aime at moderate and pacifick wayes and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that run not in extreams, are certainly the directed wayes that lead thereunto. Therefore it is observed that men of moderate and peaceable tempers, are both the wisest, and most useful men in all Societies, Extreams are alwayes dangerous: for as the Philosopher sayes of virtue, that it lie, in the middle between two vices, as the extreams are opposites on either hand, so may truth generally be found in the middle between two Errors. Some men think they can never run far enough from that they hate, whereas wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men can see as dangerous a precipice of error before them as that which they left behind them. This is too too evident in most of the controversies which have been bandyed for, and against in our times. In most of which he that hath taken the least view of the managing of such controversies, will finde that men of rigid and severe spirits, have missed both of peace and truth, the designe of all good and wise men. Thus did the Donatists in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica, and the Novatians about Rome of old, who separated from all other Christians, save those of their own perswasion till as last, there were none left either to joyn with or separate from the spinning of thread too fine, doth but draw the wool beyond the staple, and will never hold in the weaving. Thus hath it been found in these last dayes of Reformation, the Religion of many proving like precious Liquor, too often distilled, till at last all evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates into meer fume: some that could not be content to keep company with their honest minded Brethren, in the middle K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The like wisdome doth moderation discover in things of a civil nature; where many times the rigorous exaction of the strict letter of the rule of Justice, proves unjust in the issue, and most unprofitable to the <hi>Cumini sectar</hi> himself, or his instruments.

The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Abel whom the Scripture commends for her wisdome, discovered her wisdome by her peaceable Counsel. The poor wise man saved the City, by wise counsel, not by weapons of War, Eccles. 9. 15 when a great King

            <p>It was the spirit of David, one wise as the Angel of God, and no mean Warriour neither. I am for peace, but when I speak they are for War, Psal 120. 7. It seemed then David used not Wars but when necessity forced him thereunto.</p>
            <p>In matters of Religion, who is it that gains by Contention: it is the duty of every Christian to contend for the Faith once delivered to the Saints, but they ought <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as the Apostle speaks, Eph. 4. 15. least other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the loss of lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e is more matter of grief then the truth we suppose we have gained is matter of rejoycing, like them that angle for small fish with a golden Hook. Not that any truth of God ought upon any pretence to be under valued, nor any precept of God be counted little, but every thing is beautiful in his season, where the urging of some truth of less moment, may certainly endanger the breach of peace, which is a greater good, I know not, but it might with more acceptation have been for born, for we know our Saviour Christ did not, nor the Apostles after him, at every season declare such Truths, as the Hearers were not capable to receive.</p>
            <p>For all necessary and fundamental Truths, we cannot be too resolved in Contention for them: But for Opinions of less certainty and moment, where wise and good men have alwayes needed a latitude, wherein to differ and turn aside one from the other, it can be no part of wisdome to be too eager or rigorous about them, some with the Disciples, Luke 9. 54, 55 are ready to think he deserves no less then to be destroyed by fire from Heaven, if he follows not them, whom yet our Saviour justly reproves for giving too much way to their own Spirits.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Condescension, may in the next place be added, as another property of Wisdome. Humility, the ground of condescension is nearly allyed to wisdome, both are the procreant causes of great Blessings to the Sons of men, Prov. 22. 4. The wisdome that is from above is gentle, easie to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated. No man ever thought that Abraham was the less wise, because more willing to yield in the controversie between him and Lot. Those parts of the natural body that are the most yielding are the stronger and most
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:000214_0039_0FA36CFDC8662198"/>
useful, were all the other members of our body as hard, and as stiff as the Bones, how uncomfortable would our Actions and motions be. If any finde it better to break then bow, they may thereby gain some reputation for their wilfulness but not for their wisdome.</p>
            <p>This must alwayes be understood of things lawful and expedient to be yielded to, else Moses the meekest man upon Earth, will not bate an hoof, nor Paul the most humble of all Christians, will not yield, or give place for an hour; both which in other cases could deny themselves, and yield very far.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Deliberation, is the last property of Wisdome which I need mention, it can hardly be thought to consist with Wisdome to do any thing rashly in matters of moment. Temerity of Counsels argues rather height of folly and pride then depth of wisdome; for in so doing, we should lay aside Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, our most faithful and best Councellour, and commit our affairs into the hands of passion and affection, or worse, <hi>cum res transit in affectum, perit omne judicium;</hi> they loose their wisdome, that suffer themselves to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with passion. <hi>Deliberandum aiu, quod semel statuendum,</hi> it had need be a long time deliberated upon, that is to be appointed for ever after. For although our statutes be not unalterable, like those of the Medes and Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, yet that which is maturely agreed upon at the first, will stand in the less need of alteration or abrogation: the frequency of either of which abutes much of the rigour of the Laws; and honour of the Law-makers. Many things in humane affairs admit not of second thoughts, notwithstanding they are generally known to be the best. <hi>In bello non his piccat:</hi> therefore sayes Solomon, with good advice make War, and manage it likewise with the same care, lest there be no room to play an after game. And wise men account it the best way to put as little as may be to peradventure. A man of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, saith Solomon, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12. 27. is of an excellent Spirit; the Hebrew word is of a cool Spirit. <hi>Sedatus animo,</hi> slow, deliberate, composed, not hot which makes men quick and sudden in their resolves. <hi>Theod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sius</hi> that famous Christian Emperour, noted for great wisdome also, did that on the sudden in a passion, that he had cause to repent of ever after. To be flow to wrath argues great understanding in the wise mans account, <hi>P</hi>rov. 14. 29. It is reported of <hi>Heraclius</hi> the Treasurer of the said Theodosius, that giving so far way to his passion; as when the Saracens, who were hired by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour for the war came to demand their pay, he refused payment, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead thereof; passionately called them Arabick Dogs, which so incensed them that they immediately set up their own Banners, which gave occasion to those infernal Locusts that came first out of the bottomless pit, to over spread the face of the Christian World, miserably tormenting the Inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for an hundred and fifty years, where by the way may be noted, hard words are the worst kind of pay, can be made to such as venture their lives
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:000214_0040_0FA36CFE87BFA868"/>
for the service of the common-wealth. The same befell Rehoboam, whose hard, proud and haughty words, were answered by a shower of as hard stones, that fell heavy on the bones of his officers.</p>
            <p>But to return, much deliberation in publick affairs, specially if the case be about matters of moment, is rarely found a disadvantage. As was said of that old Roman, Fabius Maximus, <hi>Cunctando restituit rem,</hi> he repaired that by deliberation, and prudent delaying of matters, which some others had almost ruined, by their precipetant and heady adventures. The like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation is of use in the enacting, as well as in the executing of all civill Constitutions and Degrees: Therefore wise Lawyers have been alwayes wont to acocunt Lawes of difficult Tearms, and doubtfull event, had need be deliberately thought upon, before they be enacted, or put in execution. Israels best venison was that which was longest in preparing.</p>

The Scepter of the Man childe, by virtue of his subordination to the Lord Jesus, was to rule all Nations with the Rod of iron, as tis said, Rev. 12. If any should say, the Lord Jesus doth not need the help of the Civil Magistrate to carry on his Kingdome, I answer, although he doth not need it (for he did carry on the work of his Kingdome when all the civil Magistrates of the world were combined against it) that will not excuse Magistrates for non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performance of their duty when ever they are impowred thereunto: To all such it may be said, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

duty concerning matters of Religion, it may be reduced to these three heads. 1. The establishing the true Religion where it never was. 2. The main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and upholding of it where it is. 3. The reforming it where it is grown corrupt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Concerning the first of these, It is made by learned and judicious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, one of the undoubted Rights of Soveraignty to determine what Religion shall be publickly professed and exercised within their Dominions. <hi>sc.</hi> what in their Consciences is most agreeable to the word of God, and the divine Law. What reason can be rendred why the Popish Religion is professed only in Spain, the Lutheran in some Kingdomes and Provinces of Europe, the Calvinists in others; an indulgence granted in some Kingdomes to differing professions, but that the chief Rulers, Kings or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of State are this or that way affected? Why else doe wee in New England that profess the doctrine of Calvin, yet practise the discipline of them called Independant, or Congregational Churches, but because the authority of the Countrey is perswaded, that to be most agreeable to the mind of God.</p>
            <p>This is not to be understood, as if it were to belong to civil Rulers to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ude upon the Consciences of their Subjects and people, the profession of what doctrine or Religion they please; but that no perswasion in Religion can orderly become the publick profession of any people or person, without liberty first obtained from the supream Rulers of the Nation. For it is a most certain truth, as Lactan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>us speaks, there is nothing so voluntary as Religion, which without the wills consent is nothing. Another sayes also, he that is compelled by law to serve God in this or that way serves not God but his prince. The work of Rulers is therefore re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>her to keep men from doing evill then to compell them to doe good. Thus did the first Christian Emperours of old, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> up the Idol Temples, not suffering their subjects to walk on in the practice of their form r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bominable Idolatryes, but not compell them to embrace the Christian Faith. As did Ezekiah and Josiah before break down the Grove and other Idolls, not allowing their people publickly to commit Idolatry, and if they did compell those of their own nation to attend the Celebration of the passeover and the like, it was because that worship was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> literally enjoyned that people, and they were to be cut off that did omit it. But under the Gospel the Worship of God is more spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and requires Faith in the heart before the service of the outward man can be acceptable. Now Faith is a perswasion wrought in the heart, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred by outward compulsion, as saith Gregory, <hi>Novaet inaudita est illa <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

that is to maintain the publick profession thereof. Creation and providence are the issues of the same Being and Power. If the true Religion had not been publickly professed without the countenance of the civil Power, it is not like to be professed longer then the same power will give allowance or Command or encouragement. Now this is or ought to be done,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By taking care that publick Ministers be sent forth to preach the word of truth, administer the Sacraments, and celebrate all other rites and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, that doe concern the true Religion. Thus did Jehosophat, in the 2. <hi>Cron.</hi> 17. 7, 8, 9. So did the antient Christian Emperours by their Laws and Edicts, with other civil Constitutions. The Church by some is compared to hangings, the Common-wealth to the walls; the Church is the fruitfull Vine, the Common-wealth the prop that supports it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By providing maintenance, and other suitable encouragements for such Ministers in all their administrations, according to the Apostolical practice <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 24. and precept 1. <hi>Cor</hi> 9 5 6, 7, 9. &amp;c. For it will necessarily hold, that if Ministers by divine Institution may expect maintenance and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who should take care to see it done but the Rulers of Christian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths. God alwayes allotted a portion for those that ministred about holy things, both before the Law, and under the Law. Abraham as a man of warre paid tithes to Melchizedek as a publick Minister of God in that place, where he obtained his victory, They will have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

               </gap> the New-Testament conclude it a moral duty, with many other than might be cited, to take care they be maintained,</p>
            <p n="3">3. By setting up and encouraging the Schools of Learning, for he that wills the end is supposed also to will the meanes. It is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that the Israelits should alwayes goe down to the Philistines to sharpen their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, which they are to use in fighting against the enemies of Gods Church, or for whetting their tooles they must use in tilling Gods field. Christian Emperours of old were wont to adorn Christian Temples with the Spoyles of the Gentiles. Julian complaines that the Christians best the heathen Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers with their owne weapons, therefore did he subtilly contrive to deprive the Christians of the benefit of Schooles, &amp; other meanes of humane Learning thinking that to be the likelyest meanes whereby to overthrow the Christian Religion. Tis true that the defect of Learning in the Apostles was supplyed by the extraordinary gifts of the Holy-Ghost, but since those gifts are ceased, because other ordinary means may be sufficient for that end. God made Manna to follow the children of Israel from heaven, till they had opportunity to sow and reap in the land of Canaan, after which time the
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:000214_0044_0FA36D01894F5CA0"/>
Manna ceased. While Israel was without a teaching Priest, &amp; without a Law, they were also without the true God, 2. Chron. 15. 2. while the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were locked up in an unknown Language, how can they be opened without the key of humane Learning, or rightly divided without the study of the Workman, as the Apostle speaks. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 15. Of old time they had Colledges and Schools of Learning, of which Elijah and Elisha were Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and Overseers. What advantage the reformed Churches have had by their Princes and States erecting Schooles of Learning in their severall Dominions, is so well known that there needs no more to be said about this Argument. What considerable benefit this place hath already reaped, and as tis hoped may further receive by this one Colledge in the Countrey, founded, and hitherto carried on by the pious care and religious endeavors of our former worthy Leaders, and other liberal Benefactors, is sufficiently demonstrable to the view of the World.</p>
            <p n="4">4. By the calling of Synods or Councils, as need may require to discusse points of Religion in controversie, and to hear matters of differences and determine them, and be of use when ever there is want or truth or peace in the Churches. Some are ready to attribute too much to the power or use of Synods, which make others, or the other hand ascribe too little to them. For although civil Rulers are not absolutely tyed up to their determination further then they are grounded upon the word of God. As if the secular powers were alwayes bound to submit to the decrees of the Ecclesiastical Senate, as is practised in the Church of Rome, yet if orderly called, and duely managed, of what great use they have been in all ages, and still may be, the experience of all times can abundantly testifie, as the learned Craken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorpe in his elaborate discourse about the first general Council hath fully evidenced; nor can it ever be made out, that any general Council, where all the Requisites essential to such a Council were found, have erred in their decrees about any matter of Faith, or fundamental Article thereof, as the same Author doth assert.</p>
            <p>For although what Grotius sayes cannot be denied, that the Sovereign po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is not tyed to the judgement of Physitians in the case of a wound, nor of a Geometrician in the measuring of Land, yet is he much mistaken that from thence shall inferre, that the civil power need make no use, or can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no benefit or direction about such cases in question, before he gives his final determination in and about the same. The priests <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> should preserve knowledge; and of old they were in all arduous and difficult cases to repair to the <hi>P</hi>riest, and to the Judge that should be in those dayes. Deut 17. 9. 12. By proportion of that Text, it is no hard matter to gather what is the use and benefit, and what the power of Synods in a christian state.</p>
            <p n="5">5. By preventing the spreading and growth of corrupt Doctrine and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:000214_0045_0FA36D024AAD1BC8"/>
Opinions: I confess it is not easie to hit the joynt in this controversie yet for the satisfaction of their minds, that may need or desire, I shall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to say something to this question, and that in this order, laying down some propositions that may by degrees lead unto a meet conclution about Toleration or Suppression of di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ing Opinions: for some men will call that Religion Heresie, in which good Christians are bound to worship the God of their Fathers: Therefore all that formerly hath, or at present doth pass up and down the World under the name of Heresie, Schisme or corrupt Doctrine, is not without due ground, so to be judged and condemned. I shall not here entertain you with any sharp invective, or declaiming against a boundless toleration of all Religions, least it should be an insi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uation; that some here present are inclined that way, which I believe there was never any occasion given to suspect.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the first place therefore, I shall lay down this as an undoubted <hi>P</hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, that it is scarce possible to give any general rule about Toleration, that will suit with all times and places, but much must be left to the prudence and discretion, and religious care of Civill Rulers. A weak body, as some have said, ought not to suffer that out of charity to another which a stronger may; and it may as truely be said, that a stronger need not to suffer that which a weaker must, which some say, was the case of Holland, with the rest of the united Provinces, who have softened the sharpness of all differences about Religion found in other places so troublesome, by a more general freedome for the exercise of differing Religions or differing perswasions about Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, or connivance at them, then other States judged meet, that they might thereby gain the more hands to strengthen themselves against their common Enemies.</p>
            <p>The rule given by some others, that whatever may consist with the interest of Religion and safety of the Common-wealth, is too indefinite: For if the Civil Rulers will say that then it is not safe to allow any to dissent from the publick profession established by Law, what shall become of the weak and infirme, they must of necessity be driven to suffer ship wrack of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, and of their lives and estates, it being impossible that all Consciences can quietly submit to the Religion of the state. Doubtless as much tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness as may should be used out of pity to the infirmities of mens understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, seeing in many things we sin or offend all. That golden Rule laid down by our Saviour is of excellent use if it were attended, <hi>Alterine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

of what had been their own case in Egypt before.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Such Opinions in Doctrine, or professions and practises in Religion, as are attended with any soul practiced evils as most Heresies have been, ought to be prohibited by publick Authority, and the broachers or fomenters of them punished by penal laws, according to the nature of the offence, like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fruits of the flesh. God never appointed a Sanctuary for Satan, nor City of Refuge for presumptuous offenders. As Joab was taken from the Horns of the Altar, whether he was fled, so let all such hereti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

The deeds of the Nicholaitans, every good Christian, be he an head or member of the Christian state, ought to hast, and endeavour the extirpation of such roots of bitterness out of the Garden of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Any Doctrine undenyably tending to the disturbance of the civil state, ought to be suppressed, and the publick profession, yet by civil Authority forbidden, and the disobedient to be proceeded against, as who some and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Likewise all such as expose the religion professed by the countenance of publick Authority to vulgar contempt may justly fall under the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: concerning these as well as the former, I may say to the civil Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the Country as David said to Solomon, in another case, Thou art a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto them, 1 King. 2. 9.</p>

Yet notwithstanding there is no doubt but the civill power may and ought to non-licentiate him that shall take upon him as a Physitian to prescribe to the people poysonous Drugs instead of wholsome food or physick, although they may not punish him that shall declare that to be his opinion, unless he offend the Lawes by his irregular manner of so doing. Doubtless they that are nursing Fathers of their people, ought as well to prevent person as to provide bread for them: which seems to be all that was intended by the authority of the Countrey in the Laws formerly made against Hereticks. If the owner or keeper of the Vineyard shall make a thorn hedge about it, if any man by violence breaking in, shall wound or destroy himself, where will the blame be found, in them that made the hedg so sharp and strong, or in them that attempted without leave violently to break in?

In the last place, for those Opinions which are inconsistent with the truth of Religion, and power of godliness, and where those that profess that may in charity be supposed to have in them <hi>aliquid Dei,</hi> as Calvin, or <hi>aliquid Christi,</hi> as Bucer was wont to say, the case is far otherwise. For though I would not be understood to plead for a Toleration of the least evil, (for all error is in it self a fruit of the first sin, and part of the curse) any further then necessity requires there should be an allowance made for humane infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes in this state of imperfection. That which is wanting sayes Solomon, cannot be numbred, as that which is crooked cannot be made straight.

            <p n="1">1. For the civill concernments of the Leaders in Israel, there are exigents in reference to this as well as the former, that require much prudence and skill to know what Israel ought to doe in and about the same.</p>
            <p>There are two things principally to be attended here, 1. The modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the civil power to a due Temperament. 2. The faithfull improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it for the publick good. For the first, it is very true which a learned person observes, that power is a liquor very apt to overflow, in what vessel soever it is put, unless it be tempered with a due proportion of Wisdome and Goodness, and is apt though never so necessary in it self, to prove per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious and destructive to them that are concerned in it. It is very obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable that God give Israel Laws, Judicial as well as Ceremoniall, leaving as little as might be to the arbit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>iment of civill Rulers. And that hath been the continual care of prudent Law givers, to abate the height of Sover aign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by a meet Temperament of some of the inferiour Sort. Sue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

it is noted by a very judicious Interpreter, that when the people of Israel would not be satisfied without a king, God ordered Samuel to write the manner of the Kingdome in a Book. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 25. <q>That is the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Laws of the Kingdome to temper Monarchy with a liberty besitting his owne people, and with equity toward a Nation, which of its own free will did chuse a King, and with a benignity of Government of Brethren of the same race, to withstand the abuse of an absolute power, which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples blind desire might have caused the new King to have run into, As D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As for the improvement of this power, the titles given to such Rules in the Text, and other places of the Scripture, as a sufficient intimation of the duty of those that are called to the exercise thereof,</p>
            <p>As they are heads, so they ought to go before the members of the civil body by their pious and gave examples, as well as by their prudent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, and their just and wholsome Laws: for tis true which one hath <hi>longum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>cepta, breve &amp; efficax per exempla,</hi> examples of Rulers are always observed to take more place with their people then their precepts. <hi>P</hi>osterity will as much honour the piety of him that left a good patern of honesty or bounty, as they will the wisdome of him that left a good body of just and useful Laws. And some Princes have inherited the title and surname of good and liberal, as well as for other perfections of wisdome or justice. This way also is more fruitful in the propagating and increasing virtues, <hi>Autor ese bonorum consequentium, qui bonum rel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Have any of the Rulers believed on him, as they speak in John? you know David would not yield to an unequal Distribution of the booty, although thereby greater advantage might have accrued to his own person, by which self-denying example, so good a custome, or standing Law in Israel had its first original. We know also how much benefit hath followed such Examples in Nehemiah and others, who have been a means to provoke others to the like acts of goodness and charity by their practices.</p>
            <p>They are as Pillars that úphold the Foundation of the state, which in a sense may be said to be built thereon. David complains of the dissolution of the state in those times, before he was called to bear up the pillars of it. Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers indeed if they are built like arches, that clasp in all round together, the more weight there is laid upon them, the firmer they stand, but being disuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or not joynted in well together, they weaken the authority of each other and hasten the ruine of the whole. It was noted of Themist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>They are the Watch-men set upon the Gates of Jerusalem, to descry dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger afar off, which hath its truth in reference to civil Magistrates, as well as spiritual Watch-men, by the consent of the best Interpreters.</p>
            <p>It is not safe to give false Alarms, because it may occasion true ones to be the less regarded; nor yet to give an uncertain round, for who then can be prepared for the Battel? yet in such cases a godly jealousie should not be complained of, if a Watch-man shall cry an Enemy, when a Friend cometh, he ought more to be commended for his care, then blamed for his errour, as some have said.</p>
            <p>They are nursing Fathers to Israel, and Physitians to Gilead; it is the office of the head, not only to prevent the evill that may befail the other members of the body, but also to heal it: And therefore they must be endued with much patience to bear with the frowardness of those to whom they stand so related. Neither must they heal the wound slightly, for fear of the smart, for sometimes it will fall out that <hi>impatiens aegrotans crudelem sacit medicum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are Law givers, to prescribe wholsome Lawes and Rules of Living; the Fountains of Justice, whence flow the streames that refresh and make fruitfull the heritage of Israel. Yea, <hi>Magistratus est animata Lex,</hi> a Ruler is a living Law. The Law, sayes one, is an heart without affection, a mind without passion, a treasurer to keep what we have, and a steward to distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute what we ought to have. But it had need be considered that the life and virtue of Lawes lyes in their execution, therefore the making of more Lawes then need or can be executed, may weaken the authority of them that are in force, and necessary to be attended. Yea it is found by experience that lenity in the executing of Lawes, is more hurtfull then severity. The best way to keep an instrument in good tune, is to leave the strings upon a sharp, they being naturally apt to fall of themselves. And mankind is continually bent to declining. And Politicians use to account violation of Lawes, not so hurtfull as non-execution. In this sense he that is slothfull in his work is brother to him that is a great Waster, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18 9.</p>
            <p>They are Lords, as well as Law-givers. Nothing more truly denoting Lordship, then a power to give Lawes. No debt is more justly due their Homage tribute to the Lords of a people, which if it were freely paid, need not be exacted; where we are required to render to God the things that are Gods, in the same clause it is added likewise, to Cesar the things that be Cesars. Yet the less of the dead fly of covetousness that is found in the oyntment, the more precious will the savour thereof be found. A wise citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen of Genoa once told an Agent of the Duke of Millayn, to whom at that time they of Genoa were Subjects, that they should deal with their Tributa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

It were well for the Christian world if there had been an occasion to build more such like Cities; but this iron age hath been more successful, or rather fatal in pulling down the old, then in building up new Cities. It were the presage of happy times at hand, if once there were a good agreement established between the power of the Rulers, and liberty of their Subjects, that neither might encrease upon the others rites and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Thus much of the civil affairs relating to the Heads of Israel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the second place, the Military concernments of Israel call for no little prudence and skill, sometimes as much stress and difficulty is found here as in the former. Intricastes may be so interwoven, that it may prove very difficult to know what Israel ought to do. The Church is sometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a Lilly among Thorns, there will need Gloves of iron to handle such thorns and pricking Bryars. These may want also as well courage to know how, as wisdome to know what to do. <hi>Dolus an virtus</hi>—yea some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times God may be provoked to vex a people with all adversity. He may raise such a tempest in a Nation, as both head and Members may be at their wits end, not knowing what to do. Hence it hath been found in former times, that no manner of persons ever gained more interest in the hearts of People, then those that have manfully undertook and successfully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished their warrs. Gideon is a Judge by Gods Election, and might have been a King by the peoples but David must be a King by the call and consent of both. In former times, none were Kings but such as had been Captains, they being accounted the fittest to govern a People in time of peace, that had led them. or saved them in time of War. That valiant atchievement of Saul against the Amonites reconciled him to all his People with the highest degree of acceptance, and stopped the mouthes of all the Sons of Belial that were opened against him, at his first call to the Kingdome. Yet will it be found a truth, what that warlike people of Rome were wont to say. <hi>Parvi sunt foris arma, nisi est consilium domi.</hi> I shall only therefore here crave
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:000214_0053_0FA36D08480E2628"/>
leave to commend some considerations to your acceptance on this account, as are obvious to them that have had the least acquaintance with the sacred Hystory.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is never safe to take a Dog by the ears: so Solomon tells us, Prov. 26. 17. that is to meddle with an unnecessary strife, or begin a War without just ground. This is one part of the power of the Sword, which as the Magistrate beareth not in vain, so neither must he take it in vain. for he that so taketh the Sword, as our Saviour speaks, Mat. 26. 52. may expect to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish by the Sword: there is nothing more necessary then self preservation: and our friends as our Country are part of our selves. Noc is actual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sederation alwayes necessary for taking up Arms in the behalf of our friends, as appears by the Instance of Abraham and Lot, yet had there need be great care had, that an unnecessary war be not undertaken, for the War is on one side an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ainous evil or Murder, on both it is a Judgment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. War ought not to be made without good advice, Prov. 20. 18. &amp; 24. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. which is to be understood as well of the managing, as of the first engaging in a War. Josiah by over hasty resolves engages himself and his people in a fatal War, which proved the ruine of both. Tis true, when a Nation or people are ripe for a judgment, God doth judicially bring it upon them, yet according to the mediate causality, it may be the imprudencies, indiscretion, and want of Faith in Gods promises, not asking counsel at Gods Oracle, that may be the immediate cause. David though he had alwayes managed his war with the greatest success, yet he may seem the most timerous warriour in the World, but it was from an holy fear; he never daring to enter or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin a Battel where he was not sure of God to be his Second, or rather his Leader, Therefore we finde that he made more use of Gods Ephod, then of Goliahs Sword. Gideon though in Gods account a mighty Man of valour, yet to his own sense seems a very fearful and weak man, because his depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance was upon Gods word, more than his own valour.</p>

It is not the wisest way to divide the Bears skin, before the bear he killed. They that overcome before they begin to fight, never may have cause to boast of their victory.

Sometimes a victory will scarce countervail the charge or the hazzard and difficultyes it may be accompanied with, which made a Prince once return this sorrowfull reply to one that did congratulate his Victory, that such an other would have undone him. Such is the solemn Dispensation of God to our selves in the present warr with the Indians, that we must say, the God of our Salvation hath not answered us, but by ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible things in righteousness.

            <p>The time was not long since, that we in New-England might have said with Job, the eye that saw us, whither of friends or foes, was ready to bless us, or envy our prosperity, and might be ready to say as Balam sometimes did, (when his eyes were opened) as the beholding of the tabernacle of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, in the midst of the Standards of our four united Colonyes, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping round about, <hi>How goodly are thy tents O Jacob, and thy Tabernacles O Israel!

up to him to behold and visit this vine, but he seems not as yet willing to look down upon us, he seems only to look on, not willing to engage in our quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, as a way-faring man that turns aside for a night, as a mighty man that cannot save. May we not expostulate further with the Psalmist, The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then are come into thine inheritance, O God, The dead bodyes of thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, some of them have they given to be meat to the fowles of heaven, the flesh of thy servants to the beasts of the earth, Their bloud have they shed like water, and there is none to bury them. How long Lord, wilt thou be angry for ever, shall thy jealousie but in like fire before thou pour thy wrath upon the heathen that have not, and will not know thee, nor call upon thy Name? How hath the Lord covered our Sion with a cloud in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; how many men and women here present may say, we are the men and the women, the persons that have seen affliction by the rod of his wrath. Here is one like old Jacob ready to say, his gray hairs will be brought down with sorrow to the grave, and that he shall go mourning thither after the children of his old age. There is another with Rachel. weeping and will not be comforted, because her children are not: they are gone into captivity never to return, or removed into the other world by the sword of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Doth not many an one sit solitary in widdowhood, that before might take much content in the husband of her youth, that now of the children which they brought into the world, have none to take them by the hand. Surely affliction doth not spring out of the dust, nor doth trouble arise out of the ground: Doubtless there is some root of bitterness, whence this Gall &amp; wormwood of affliction hath proceeded, After this and that time of seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, we looked for deliverance, and behold trouble came. Many sad troubles have befaln us in former years, and now one of the forest is come upon us, the Sword, and that of a cruel enemy, which uses not to be drawn upon Gods owne people till lesser chastisements have proved ineffectual. But some may say for what great evill is it, that God hath thus changed his hand toward us, and what may be the cause of this great Anger?</p>
            <p>I shall offer my thoughts in a few words.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the first place I can presume none reflect upon the constitution of our Government, either in Church or State. Wise Master-builders have laid the foundation of the Building, a better who can desire to be laid, either for the liberty of the people, or just power of them that rule? Were not our foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations laid with Saphyres, and our stones with fair colours? Was not the patern in the mount, the rule that was attended in the laying of our plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form of Order? Was there any Temptation upon the minds of them that were concerned in that work to swerve there from to the right hand or to the left. Or if any disposition, or the least inclination had been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned that way, had you not power to have laid those aside &amp; placed others
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:000214_0058_0FA36D0C5377F2A0"/>
in their room and stead! Much might be said here if there were need.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If you enquire into the succession of our Leaders, and succenturiation of the persons called to supply the room of them that having served their generation, are now fallen asleep in the Lord. Have they not acted accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to former principles, and shewed the same spirit of Faith and Holiness Zeal for Gode glory and purity of worship, the same love to God and his wayes? Have they built hay or stubble upon the Foundation formerly laid? It hath alwayes been the humour of those that follow to be ready to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the present age wherein they live, which Solomon checks as proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from want of judgment, <hi>Eccless.</hi> 7. 10. Thou enquirest not wisely concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this matter. Every age doth not yield a David nor a Solomon. Yet it is observed, things went well in Judah in Rehoboams time. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12. 12. so long as the ordinances were duly observed about Gods worship good judgment and justice executed, and in many of the Princes and people good things were found. Much more was this to be acknowledged in the reign of Asa, and Jehosaphat, though of them it might be said, <hi>non nulla desideran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> yet they aimed at the best patern in Sincerity. Their hearts were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect with the Lord their God, as was the heart of David their father. Possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly some upon every check and frown of providence against us, may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with Saul to call for the Lot to be cast, and will be too forward without a perfect Lot, to say the cause is in Saul or in Jonathan, or in the people. Or else adde there is some Achan in the camp, and Jonas in the Ship, that must immediately be made a sacrifice to divine Justice, as they may misconceive. We must not lye for God, and need be carefull we doe not entitle divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to the mistakes of our minds, and make God speak that by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which never entred into his heart. Of many outward changes it is most certain, that we can know neither love nor hatred thereby. Some men may be ready to say, there is too much indulgence towards men of corrupt mindes, and it is to be feared in some of our Rulers too. It is two to one if some doe not say the contrary. For we know what animadversions have been made by men of other perswasions, none had need give any occasion to such misconstructions of Gods hand, by an ungrounded suiting of times with events. Were it not a more probable way for us to know our own duty, (that is the surest way to know the mind of God concerning ourselves) and engage to doe it, letting alone those things wherein possibly we may not be all of one minds: Forgetting therefore those things that are behind, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle speaks, let us set upon those things that are before us, wherein we are all agreed upon our duty, leaving the other to the decision of further light and after times. <hi>Deus et dies revelabit.</hi> A divided language hindred the building of Babel, and forced the undertakers to desist. as the Poet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses it, one sayes make that rope fast, the other lets it fly. How then

can we conceive it should tend to build up Sion. No doubt but an unguided and indiscreet zeal in many to promote, or profess their opinions in the most publick manner, hath done much mischief in the world. And possibly a like errour to suppress them, by undue means hath done some. Let no mans good be evill spoken of, Peradventure some men might have let fall their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions or errors, as the Traveller did his cloake, if they had not been too boisterously and rudely set upon by their opposites. If we find <hi>cor bonum &amp; honestum,</hi> as one said of Swen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Although they are in a great error that out of love to the wine, swallow down the dregs after it, yet they are in a greater that refuse the good liquor because of the Less in the bottome. The best wheat hath its chass. God may reveal more of his mind to those that differ from us as well as to our selves, could we but have patience to wait his leisure. And we should the rather commiserate the infirmityes of other mens understandings, because our own are not as yet arrived at perfection. So much modesty becomes every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, as not to condemn all he doth not understand, so neither to call for fire from heaven against any that may differ from him. Nor is every one to be taxed as a party in the case, that is not so forward as another to call for a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill sword, to end the controversie. Possibly some in the world have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy experienced the verification of our Saviours words, in this sense; they that take up the sword shall perish with the sword. Paul tells us <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 5. 6. he that keepeth or regardeth the day, regardeth it to the Lord: He that regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the day to the Lord he doth not regard it. All mens Consciences are not enlightened in the same degree. Were it not better to debate the cause with our neighbours, with those we dissent from, and not so peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily to entitle Gods truth to the private apprehensions of our selves, or our owne party, in such cases where possibly the whole truth is not revealed; such proceedings it may be, doe but embolden disengaged standers by to complain of both, as befell B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

readiness to give up themselves to the work and service of their Generation. Such as have offered themselves willingly, and have not loved their lives to the death. You have had Presidents of your Colonies and Colleges, that have been bred or brought up in the Country; Hath not God in a great measure been ready to make good what he hath spoken by the Prophet Amos I will power of my Spirit upon your young men, And chosen of such to be Nazarites, is it not thus? If any think I am too long upon this Theam, they may consider the readiest way to obtain a return of the like favour, or a continuance of the former, is, thankfully to acknowledge what is, as well as what hath been. He that hath done this, can do yet more. God is but waiting for an opportunity of our thankfulness and humility to turn his face toward us that we may be saved.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Gods providential dispensations toward his People ordinarily hold a proportion with his former promises: God is ordinarily wont to be with his People, while they are with him: for although he may out of his absolute Soveraignty turn aside out of the ordinary road of his dealings without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us an account, as he did with Job: And with the whole Church, <hi>Psal.</hi> 43. 17. All this is come upon us, yet have we not forgotten thee, nor dealt deceitfully in thy Covenant, and Gods dispensations toward his Elect in their particular persons are more various; yet as to Provinces and people that profess his Name God doth usually suit his dispensations with the wayes of his people, in all ages it hath been so, specially under the Law: under the Gospel, God hath been pleased to order events something otherwise though still it is found a truth, that Godliness hath the promise of the life that now is, and that which is to come; yet may it be observed, that in the primitive times, when was evidenced the great pourings out of the Spirit, may be greater then ever shall be again till the general Resurrection; there were never sadder calamities that befel the people of God in all former ages. Herein was God pleased to discover the power of his Grace, in not suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Bush to be consumed, though the fire was increased seven fold, even by that admirable way of manifestation of the faith and patience of the Saints was the World convinced of the truth of the Gospel, that he who was in them that professed it, was greater then he that was in the World which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed it, in that all the World could do, they could not put a stop to the progress of Christs Kingdome. Their hearts were then raised to so eminent a degree of holiness and piety, (being refined by that fire of persecution from their Dross) that they could discerne the least buddings of sin, and the first rise of any worldly lusts, which made them ready to condemn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves under those several fiery Tryals in the Furnace of affliction (wherein they were Gods chosen Jerusalem) as if those judgements of the Sword of persecution, were only occasioned by some defection in their sincerity, and
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:000214_0061_0FA36D0E49BE4728"/>
for want of upright walking with God. And sure, there might be cause even for that virgin and pure Church to condemn themselves for some spots or wrincles in that garment which is abundantly evident in those expressions uttered in the Epistles to the seven Churches in Asia: so that their afflictions through the admirable concurrence of divine providence might happen for correction, as well as for temptation and tryal. If we of this Country, the many Churches here seated, should look our faces in the Glasse, may not we have cause to take up the like complaint concerning our selves, which they often did, or were bound to do, Rev. 2. 5. They that shall wisely and seriously consider the several ingredients in this cup of trembling (we have been made all to drink of more or less) may give a near guess at the disease either we have laboured under, or are running into. It uses to be a rule with the Divine Physician as well as others <hi>obstare principiis,</hi> and <hi>venienti oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currere morbo.</hi> If any dare be confident to say, they are not far gone of some dangerous Spiritual malady it self, what if God will have his Servants in the first planting of the Gospel in the West, have some experience of the like changes with them in the East parts of the World? or cause it to befal us as it did Nehemiah in the building of the Temple. after the return from Babylon, that they were forced to carry the Weapon of War in the one hand and the Trowel in the other.</p>
            <p>And what if it should be found thut Israel hath sinned, and it is as yet hid from our Rulers, as well as from our selves? there hath been some things objected against the proceedings with the Indians; both in times foregoing as well as later, relating both to the present war, and former peace, of which it were sad if there were cause to say, <hi>Hac dici potuisse, &amp; non potuisse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felli.</hi> But I intend not to meddle with things out of my line, or above my Sphear. Therefore leaving those things that are yet latent or doubtful, and come to those things about which we may all agree, I fear, that as before it hath been said by some, God hath a controversie with New-England, so now that the rod of affliction, hath not only budded and blossomed, but brought forth its fruit, may we not all conclude, that there are some matters of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, that God hath against us, that notwithstanding all threatnings, and solemn warnings both by the word as well as by the works of God, could not be reformed. Therefore God was not willing to lay aside his quarrel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us. And for this and that transgression would not tturn away the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishment of New-England. I shall instance but in two things, as to my own observation, most likely to render us obnoxius to such severe animadversions from the Almighty, and wherein we have been, as I apprehend, most apt to offend, 1. Spiritual Pride. 2. A Spirit of Worldly-mindedness: wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that whatever else hath been reckoned amongst provoking evils by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hands upon like occasions; might seriously be considered and amended.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="unknown:000214_0062_0FA36D0F083793A0"/>That which leads me to pitch upon the two forementioned evils, as the procuring cause of these sad corrective dispensations of God toward us, is because it is most probable, that it is something, that lies as a worm at the root and vitals of Religion, threatning and endangering a great decay, and withering of the power of godliness, that neither civil nor ecclesiastical cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures can reach, which is the matter to be reformed, some secret heart evill, that is likely to bring a Consumption upon the very vitals, and power of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and such are those two premised evils. For the first of these, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Spiritual Pride, it is ready to hide it self like Saul amongst the stuffe, being too often found mingled with good things and commendable vertues, <hi>vitia caetera in peccatis ipsis, superbia in ipsis recte factis timendae,</hi> pride is oft to be found in things well done. This sin hath that advantage, that it is not only consistent with, but is apt as it were to spring from our very graces, and good works, or arise among them, as Tares were found in the field where wheat was at first sown, and also found growing; men may acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally come to be lifted up, upon the consideration of their gifts, parts, privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, yea graces and duties well performed. Pride, though no weed else, was found in Paradise it self, no wonder then if it should be found in the best Churches upon the Earth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Spiritual pride is an evil, the very best of Gods Children are incident unto, witness David and Hezekiah, in whom it did not only bud but blossome, and Paul the very chief of the Apostles, in whom it had some kind of root, and might have budded, if it had not been nipped by the thorn in the flesh, sent him in mercy from God, that he might not be exalted above measure, and so fall into the same condemnation of the Devil.</p>
            <p>God will rather have his people poor and humble, then rich and proud, rather pent up in a corner, then roomthy, and swoln with pride, rather di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed and oppressed, then enlarged to wandring and security; yea if it be but to prevent the prevailing, or the appearance of such a distemper. <hi>Serb medicina paratur, &amp;c.</hi> therefore God will prevent the first rise of evil in his people; that there may be no spot found amongst them, so unbecoming his Children.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Spiritual pride is a sin very provoking and offensive in the sight of God He will hold such at a distance, it is not the spot of his Children. Davids Murder and Adultry shall sooner be pardoned without publick pennance, then his spiritual pride. There is he compelled to make a publick confession and recantation of this evil, when he sees the Angel standing with a drawn Sword over Jerusalem. What have these poor sheep done, let thine hand be against me, and against my fathers house, 2 Sam.24. Nor can Hezekiahs pride be passed by, till he humble himself greatly, and all Jerusalem with him, 2 Chron. 32. 26. Yea Paul himself shall be buffeted, as well as feel the thorn
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:000214_0063_0FA36D0FC8AC8908"/>
in the flesh, for the removal of the badge of this offensive evil.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This is not the first time that this sin hath been putting up head in New-England, and solemnly testified against in this place: <hi>sid verbum sat sapients.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. There may be cause to fear, yea and to declare also that spirituall pride is too evident in New-England at this time, notwithstanding all complaints and humbling providences of God in former times. Not to make any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here of that effeminate childish pride in habit, attire (which it is much the grave and prudent example of the Sober, and wiser persons, the restraint of the heads of Familyes cannot reform without the help of civill Lawes) and that in those of the meaner sort, where it most reigns and is most offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive. Let all things be done decently and in order. What ever the pride of any mean persons may prompt them to think, whatever is not according to order; is very indecent; <hi>sc.</hi> for the peasant to equal the prince, or imitate him in garbe or in gate, or for the handmaid to emulate her mistriss. Will not this occasion the base to behave themselves proudly against the Honourable, a fore-runner of sad confusion breaking in upon a degenerating people. <hi>Isa.</hi> 3. Kings Daughters were of old threatned for their strange Apparrel, which it may be did not much exceed some of our dayes. Soft Raiment is the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of Kings houses, not the badge of pilgrims and strangers Familyes. Yet had the children of princes and Kings daughters their ornaments which it was not customary for others to imitate. The prudent husband-man u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses more to be delighted in the busie, active yet sable Bee, then in the gaudy Butterfly, which it may be ranges all over the field to get only fine colours wherewith to paint her wings, from those flowers whence the other dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent creatures fetch both was and honey, wherewith they both build their houses, and furnish them with provision, to feed themselves, and refresh their owners, while the other are but the object of childrens sport.</p>
            <p>Let all due testimony be borne against this kind of pride, so abounding; but it is another sort, spiritual pride, that is so offensive in the sight of God, and is indeed the root whence the other springs, with many other hainous evils that are apt to provoke the Lord to jealousie: and which is the sin of the professing part of the Country as well as of others: which is but too evident in the conceitedness of mens gifts of their priviledges, liberties and Estates, whence is apt to proceed clareness of minde, haughty looks, super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilious contempt of others, needless separation from, rigid censures of men equal to, if not better then themselves; implacableness, with other each like disposition of minde. This is the root from whence spring all those scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous breaches, sharp contentions, paroxismes of division: for only by pride says Solomon, Prov. 13. 10. comes contention: from this fountain springs those bitter strifes, in Towns and Churches, that prove like a <hi>

convert the meanes applyd for the remedy to increase the malady.</p>
            <p>Disorders of all sorts spring from hence, and that in every respect, for hence it is that Leaders are not good enough to command, and that Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are too good to obey; the Centurion in the Gospel found no such diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in his way, I say to one go and he goeth, of them that are under me, to another come and he cometh; yet was he a man under the authority of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as himself acknowledgeth. This was of old a presage of ruining dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentions in old Rome, <hi>Pompeiusvè parem, Coesarvè priorem, quie ferre po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test.</hi> when there are such Chasmaes and hiatus's in the superiour or inferiour parts of a state, they are sad Omens, portending ruine. The observation of the fifth Command, that first Command of promise, as was said before, leads the way to the due observance of all the rest. Were you not afraid to speak against my Servant Moses? God was never reconciled to that proud, stiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necked unsubdued Generation that murmured and rebelled against Moses &amp; Aaron but consumed them in the Wilderness. From this root of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness also proceed those other evill fruits of Jealousies, Envy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not that holy Jealousie, or fear concerning others, the Apostle had over the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, which he calls a godly Jealousie lest Satan should beguile them. This is nothing but a regular fear lest any thing should disturb the peace or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the purity of what we love: But the other is an ungrounded fear lest others should out-doe us, or be preferred before us; not willing others should stand by us or near us, attended with a kind of hatred if they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>. This pride also is the root of the evill affections of Envy, which is like felt water, which makes the streightest thing seem crooked that is put into it. This is a great vanity, of which the wise man complained, that for every right work a man should be envyed of his neighbour, which yet springs from this root of pride. Some entertain such an opinion concerning themselves, as they conceive nothing can be well done if they have not an hand therein, whereas Paul is content and rejoyceth that Christ is preached though him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self be shut up in prison, that the truth is at liberty though himself be in bonds. This spirit of pride maintains that office of Lying, which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of not long since in this place, detracting from, or defrauding of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Hence also is that Self-willedness, that spirit of revenge whereby some cannot bear to be opposed, but must be chief, and will have their wills though they turn every stone. <hi>Tantant animis coelestibus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And Judas that carried the Bag, yet was a pentioner of Satan, though outwardly in the visible Kingdome of Christ, yea in his Family, yet as little suspected as any of the rest. What complaints have been made against this sin in the Church, and Lawes made against it in the Commonwealth, yet still it lives and hides it self as if there were no coming at it.

There was a sad curse laid upon Jerecho the city of the Moon, an emblem of this lower world, which reformed chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches should trample under their feet; that whoever should build it again, should lay the foundation thereof in his first-born, and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son, which it is well if some mens hearts doe not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them, as if the hand of God that hath been writing bitter things against us, hath not amongst others written some such thing as this. Is not this to set up new Gods? Is it a wonder then that we find war in our gates. God is knocking the hands of New-England people off from the world, and from new Plantations, till they get them new hearts, resolved to reform this great evill. These things may seem harsh, yet when the Lord is crying aloud in his providence, who can for bear speaking in this kind. The Lyon hath roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who will not fear, the Lord hath spoken, who can but prophesie <hi>Am.</hi> 3. 8 Nivard in Burgundy once told his fellow brethren, Bernard &amp; Guido, (who had newly renounced the world, and entred into Monasteryes, telling their other brother, that they had left him all their earthly possessions) that they had made no equal division, taking heaven for themselves, and leaving him what was here below, It may be God hath observed some of his children here doing the contrary, too ready to exchange the Kingdome of heaven for earthly possessions, and therefore sayes he will undoe that bargain, as we use to doe the foolish bargains of our Children. If this be the guize of New England, or that there appears any disposition that way, It is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of God our great Land-lord, layes his arrest upon our tillage, and straines for his glory, as our divine Astronomer tells us in the prognostick of this present year.</p>
            <p>The honoured and respected in the Lord, you that are the Heads and Leaders of our Tribes, I have endeavoured to set before you the two great Evills that I humbly conceive may most probably be looke upon, not as the least of the procuring causes of these chastisements; in letting loose the rage of the Heathen against us, so far as any deserving cause may be found in us.</p>
            <p>God tells his people of old, that he will move them to jealousie by them that are no people, and provoke them by a foolish nation, <hi>i. e.</hi> by those whom they despised and must contemned. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 21. How have we been too apt to speak contempt by of the Indians, as if one of us; could drive hundreds of them. It may be it hath been so in former times, when God put the dread of us upon them that were round about us.

strangely to work against us, but it may be to humble us and prove us, that he may doe us good in the latter end. God may have other ends also that he aims at in these solemn Dispensations, that doe not yet appear: and when he hath performed his whole work upon our Zion, he will punish the stout heart of our enemies as we trust,</p>
            <p>One other end that God may have, may be to teach us Warre, as was said <hi>Jud.</hi> 3. 2. at least those that knew nothing of it before, which in a Sence is true of most of us. The knowledge of any thing that is gotten by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is quite another kind from that which is acquired by other meanes. We knew nothing of the practick of warr, we should never have learnt by all our Trainings and Artilleryes in former times: and it is well if they have not taught us something else, which God is now unteaching us. We see now plainly that it is one thing to drill a Company in a plain Champagne and another to drive an enemy through the desert woods. Yet Gods Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el need not be discouraged, God may be in the midst of us, though we doe not yet so manifestly discern him as we wish for, and is going up with a shout <hi>Psa.</hi> 45.7. He uses to sit as a Refiner over his fire. And when he hath prepared the Soyle by ploughing and harrowing he will cast in the precious Seed. Light is sown for the righteous, &amp; joy for the upright in heart. They that sow in tears, shall reap in Joy. God doth not at any time willingly afflict the Children of men, but at no time over afflict them.</p>
            <p>If you enquire what remedy may be prescribed against the two fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned evils, feared to be too far grown, or growing upon us: I shall at present advise but to this one Catholick remedy; and that is Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian charity, there is a medicament which they call <hi>Unguentum Apostolorum</hi> so named from the number of the ingredients, this I now mentioned may more properly be so called, but rather the example and authority then the number of the Apostles, who in their writings as well as their Lord and Master in his Doctrine did so much insist upon it, Above all these put on cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Col. 3. 14. Charity is the fulfilling of the Law; so as if that had been duely attended in our hearts and lives, as well as in our professions, it would have at first prevented the miscarriages of our Churches, and may on that ground be the most likely means to heal us and revive things amongst us, to their primitive state of purity and perfection, for when did iniquity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, but when the love of many began to wax cold. When a learned man in the former age once read some part of the Gospel, he suddenly broke forth into these words, <hi>aut hoc non est evangelium. aut nos non sumus evangelici,</hi> so may one say of our times, when he reads 1 Cor. 13. <hi>aut hoeo non est charitas; aut nos non sumus charitate imbuti.</hi> The genuine race of this heavenly plant is almost worne out of knowledge in the world. Paul com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains in his time that all men sought their own things, and none the things of Jesus Christ: what would that holy Apostle say, that had the care
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:000214_0068_0FA36D14177FB770"/>
of all the Churches still lying upon his heart, if he were alive and present a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us in this generation.</p>
            <p>If I had the tongue of Men and Angels, and but one hours time to speak unto you, I could not better improve it, then by pressing upon you a consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious care and endeavour to exercise and practise this excellent grace, this most christian virtue, which might be thought a superfluous thing thus to press, as one not long since expressed, did we only know the Gospel and not the lives of them that profess it.</p>
            <p>And I seriously affirm, I know no way else to advance the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity to its pristine glory in the world. The flourishing beauty of this heavenly grace, was that which did so strangely metamorphose the visage and face of things at first in the world, when was fulfilled that of Isaiah, that the wolf and the lamb should dwell together, and the leopard lye down with the kid. It was the verdant lustre of this divine grace, that turned the rough and barren wilderness of the world into a fruitful Carmel, or fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant Sharon. When the Christian World had first put on this precious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire of Charity, the smell of its Garments were like Lebanon, as a field which the Lord had blessed. This spirit turned Shevir and Hermon those Lions dens and mountains of Leopards into the holy and peaceable moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Lord, where was found nothing that should hurt or destroy. But alas when this <hi>terras estroea reliquit,</hi> when this spirit of love began to decay; then did iniquity and unrighteousness break in upon the Christian world like a torrent that carried all before it. Then did the Churches Sharon return back into the wilderness again, and then the excellency of Carmel began to shake off its fruits. Then did they nothing but hurt and destroy in all Gods holy Mountains: then was the Temple of God become a den of Thieves, a cage of ravenous and unclean birds, and so hath continued ever since, and so is like still to remain, till the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled and the years of Antichrist be run out, unless a mighty spirit of Grace be poured upon the World: For ever since the fatal feuds and dissentions paganized and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Christendome, as one not unaptly tells them, are become the scandal of the Mahometans in the East, and we the pretended reforming Protestants of Europe, the divided sects of Luther and Calvin are become, if not the scorn of, yet less tremendous to those at Rome. And we may have great cause to fear, that the decay of this Grace in New-England, hath in a great measure been the procuring cause that hath brought this black Cloud upon the beautiful face of our Sion in these ends of the Earth. Paul complained in his time of a great decay of Charity, even where other gifts abounded: he tells the Corinthians they were carnal, and walked as men not for want of other gifts of knowledge which pussed up but for want of charity, which only edifies: in those times he found but few Timothies that cared for the good of others, but many Demasses that sought their own good, and many
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:000214_0069_0FA36D14818AFD30"/>
Diotrephers that sought their own exaltation, and preferment, with the under valuing and contempt of others: could Christians but be perswaded to put off this private selfish worldly Spirit, and put on humility, and charity, and manifest a publick Spirit; how would it again revive the glory of New-England Churches.</p>
            <p>We have many complaints amongst us, could we but get our hearts stored with this Christian virtue, it would prove as a Balm out of Gilead, a sovereign remedy against all our troubles. This Grace of charity in the compleat and perfect exercise thereof would heal all our divisions, reform all our vices, root out all our disorders, make up all our breaches. This would cure all the morellianisme, and libertinisme in the Brethren of New-England Churches; and it would cure also all the Prelacy, and Presbyterianisme in the Elders of the said Churches: we should presently then have better thoughts one of another, for love thinketh no harm. So for other Maladies and Distempers in our minds, or distresses in our outward Estates, Charity would be like the Widows Oyle, that would never cease running till it had filled all the vessels. This would pay all our debts, and defray all our publick charges, This would relieve all our distressed friends, it would answer all the necessities of Church and State. This would feed all our poor, and clothe all our naked Brethren, and support all our Widows and Fatherless ones. It would maintain all our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters so, that they who preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel: and this would at a more honourable rate, and without repining afford the bread of the Governour. In a word what would not charity do of this kinde: publick Faith hath in several ages been bankrupt, but publick charity never was yet. The Churches Treasury of the primitive times, that was supplied only with this spring of charity was never drawn dry. Yea although the primitive christians were to encounter with all kinde of adversity, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with Famine and Nakedness, with all kind of wants, yet was their Treasury never wasted. All the powers of the Earth were combined against them, and of Hell too, yet it never failed: I tell you if we could set up such a Bank of Christian Charity in New England, it would prove a richer Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house then all the Spanish Mines or Banks of Venice, or Amsterdam. This would make such an equal distribution of the things of this life through the whole Camp of Israel, that he who gathered much should have nothing over, and they that gathered little should have no lack: for this with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment would make godliness the greatest gains to all that trailed therein. Then would one Christian Brother, Neighbour and Friend, assist and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then each other, and all endeavours would be firmly engaged to promote the common good.</p>
            <p>Thus Honoured, Reverend, much respected and beloved in the Lord I have endeavoured to commend something to your consideration from these

words, speaking first unto you all in your several and distinct capacities, and at the last have attempted to bind you up all together in one bundle with the Bond of Charity, that bond of perfectness, could all the heads and Leaders of our Tribes be twisted together by the Spirit of love, it would make a threefold Cord that could not easily be broken: it would make our Forces how weak soever in themselves become an host like the hill of God, though not in numbers, yet in virtue and power against which our Enemies should not be able to stand up. Were our Jerusalem thus compacted together, the Gates of Hell with all their instruments would never be able to undermine it, or prevail against it. <hi>Sed hic labor, hoc opus est.</hi> It must be from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>It was the observation of a wise States man in the former age, concerning that famous and flourishing Common-wealth of the Romanes of old; <hi>In republic â Romanâ cives erant utilissimi, &amp; optimè compositi, qui aut consules populo favibant aut tribuni in partes senatus inclinaboent,</hi> i. e. The Common-wealth of Rome never flourisht so well, as when those in the highest place of Authority were wont to favour the interest of the Peoples Delegates, and on the other hand, when the delegates of the people were most apt to incline to the Rulers to maintain the dignity and authority of all such. By proportion I may add, it would tend not a little to the advancing a Christian state, where Elders of Churches are very tender of the liberty of the Brethren, and the Brethren likewise are regardful of the office, power of their Elders; where the elder people do encourage the younger with their gentle and courteous behaviour, as well as with their grave Examples, and prudent Counsels, and the younger sort of people are ready to reverence the aged, not behaving themselves proudly against the ancient, where the rich are libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, bountiful and compassionate to the poor, and the poor are likewise thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and respective to the other; and alwayes will when they meet, be ready to bless each other in the name of the Lord, as Boaz and his Reapers in the field. When those of Zebulun have cause to rejoyce in their going out, and the Children of Issachar dwell quietly and live comfortably together in their Tents at home, calling the people to the mountains to offer the Sacrifice of Righteousness. When one doth joyfully gather the fruits of the Earth, as the other shall suck the abundance of the Seas, -and of the treasure hid in the Sands. How good and how pleasant would it be for any one to see the Heads and Brethren of each of our Tribes, thus to dwell together in Unity? doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it would be as the precious oyntment on the head of Aaron our high Priest, a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
