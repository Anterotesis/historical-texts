            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHEN the following pages were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the preſs, it was the wiſh and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the Author to remain in oblivion. A variety of cauſes have poſtponed its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; and <hi>conjecture</hi> ever buſy, and <hi>curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity</hi> ever prying, have lifted up the veil of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment, and many are acquainted with the name and ſituation which ſhrouded in an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py mediocrity, it was hoped would have eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the obſervation of the world. Baffled in this her favorite wiſh, ſhe feels it a duty to apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logize, with her very humble talents, for thus appearing in public. She very well know<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, that writers of Romance are not highly eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated. She is likewiſe ſenſible that cuſtom and nature, which have affixed the duties of woman to very confined and very limited bounds, are by no means likely to patronize a female writer. She feels that her conduct
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:039134_0003_1013AF6C722A0698"/>
needs excuſe, and though the independence of her mind renders her unwilling to make one, yet neceſſity obliges her to it. She is ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that ſo many will acknowledge the truth of her aſſertion, that ſhe does not heſitate to declare, that not one ſocial, or one domeſtic duty, have ever been ſacrificed or poſtponed by her pen; and though it may be objected that the time devoted to it, might have been better employed; She hopes that ſhe may be allowed in ſome reſpects, to be a judge of her own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; her pen has always been a favorite im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, it has ſoothed many <hi>melancholy,</hi> and ſweetened many <hi>bitter</hi> hours. Her abilities are too ſcanty, to allow her to underſtand either religious or philoſophical ſubjects in others, much more inadequate to the attempting them herſelf; incapable of undertaking the labours of hiſtory, or of attaining the ſublime heights of poetry; the only path which lay open, was that of Romance. The Revolution in France, and the perturbated ſtate of Europe, have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened ſome ſcenes, that would, without theſe amazing ſhocks to the political world, have lain hid in obſcurity; to ſome of theſe ſhe has had recourſe, and many, very many ſerious truths
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:039134_0004_1013AF6DF42F8710"/>
are interwoven with the ſtory of JULIA. It may perhaps be objected, that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of our own country diſplay a vaſt field for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agination, and that we need not croſs the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantic in ſearch of materials to found the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al tale or amuſing ſtory upon … But an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to introduce living characters, or thoſe recently dead, rendered Europe a ſafer, though not a more agreeable theatre. With real hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and a trembling diffidence, this little work is preſented to the public, and as a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocrity of genius, will not authoriſe a hope for the approbation of the connoiſſeur; that it may be ſhielded from the cenſures of the critic, is all that is expected. It comes like the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble JULIA, ſoliciting patronage and protection as a boon that will inſure its ſucceſs; not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding as a due, what perhaps it will not be found to merit; with a variety of defects, it is dedicated to the public, by</p>

            <head>Preface, BY THE AUTHOR.</head>
            <p>THERE are ſo few people that read prefaces, that they are become quite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſhionable; and many a volume is uſhered into the world, without what was once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a neceſſary appendage; I am however induced to deviate from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing mode, and to preſent a few obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by way of preface.</p>
            <p>I am apprehenſive from the peruſal of the title page, that JULIA may, by ſome, be conſidered, a political work; as I have ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:039134_0006_1013AF7736918738"/>
hated female politicians, I think it abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to declare it is not; intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unacquainted with politics, I ſhould have viewed a revolution of the greateſt part of Europe as it reſpected them, with uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern and indifference, and though the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart muſt bleed at the recital of the miſeries which are inflicted by pride, ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, cruelty or mad ambition; though the tribute of many a tear, muſt be paid to the ſorrows of all mankind, from the unfortun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Louis, to the wretched Weſt-India ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro, yet I ſhould have paſſed them by, as evils, to which mankind will always be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. But when we ſee the greateſt part of the world, throwing off the ſhackles of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and becoming by profeſſion, as well as by precept, infidels; it is impoſſible not to conſider it as a revolution from piety, and
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:039134_0007_1013AF78BA7410C8"/>
from morality; and leaving politics intirely out of ſight, we ſhudder at the preſent view, and ſhrink from the diſtant proſpect.</p>
            <p>I am very ſenſible, that the ſtory of JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIA, interwoven as it is with the Count DE LAUNA, would if portrayed by the pen of a Conſtantia, or decorated by the inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poetry of a Philenia, been adorned with a thouſand graces, that my ſimple ſtyle can never beſtow; but it is with ſome pleaſure I reflect, that if it cannot obtain the praiſe of the literati, it will not offend the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſt, and I have a prevailing hope, that its various errors will be paſſed over in ſilence, when it is conſidered that the motive which induced its publication, was a wiſh to do good, or at leaſt to guard againſt evil.</p>

               <p>JUST at the cloſe of one of thoſe delightful days, ſo common in the ſouth of France, the carriage of the Counteſs DE LAUNA deſcended into a charming valley, and the eye of the owner, which had for ſeveral hours been ſuffuſed with tears, was caught by the beauty of the ſcene; her heart had been ſo intirely occupied with ſome recent ſorrow,—ſo lacerated by affliction long ſince paſſed, that her imagination had wandered from the Coach, and had conducted her to the death bed of her beloved friend, or the ſide of an afflicted brother: indeed ſhe had ſome ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of a nature ſtill nearer to herſelf: but with an expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive heart and unuſual benevolence of ſoul, ſhe frequently forgot, or at leaſt buried her woes in the griefs of others:—At this time her mind was unuſually agitated; and when ſhe caught a view of the ſun now almoſt ſetting; a proſpect of the verdure with which the ſurrounding hills were cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, and a viſion of the lucid ſtream which flowed around them, ſhe thought how often her ſpirits had been calmed, and her mind harmonized, by a view of the beauties of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: "Surely (ſaid ſhe) they cannot wholly loſe their effect; I will try and ſteal if poſſible a tranſient tranquility from

objects ſo ſimple ſo ſublime!" She alighted and bidding her attendants drive to the top of a neighbouring hill, ſhe walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on; ſometimes ſtopping to ſurvey the beauty of the ſcene, and moralizing as ſhe went, ſhe thus found in ſome meaſure that tranquility of which ſhe had been in purſuit. Almoſt at the bottom of the hill, in a little turn of the road, ſhe found a neat Cottage; the perfect ſimplicity of which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted her attention; a ſeat was at the door, a door whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overſhadowed with grapes and woodbine; the frag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> from the houſe, no ſooner caught her car, than it reached her heart; and impatient to ſooth, even, if ſhe could not relieve, ſhe entered without ceremony, and was immediately ſtruck by the appearance of an old Man, who had juſt expired. By the ſide of his bed ſtood a young Girl, whoſe face was ſtrongly agitated by agonizing ſorrow, but it could not conceal her beauty; which even in that trying moment, was too uncommon to paſs unobſerved a moment; her hands were claſped together, her eyes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> upon the inan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imate body, and her whole frame ſeemed convulſed by affliction.</p>
               <p>The ſimple garb in which ſhe was attired, was by no means calculated to adorn; but could not veil the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of her perſon; after a ſecond's heſitation, Madam DU LAUNA, in a voice ſoft and plaintive, and a language that could not be miſunderſtood, for it came from the heart and it went to the heart; thus addreſſed the fair mourner. "I do not attempt to comfort you (ſaid ſhe) that muſt be the work of time, but heaven who pities your diſtreſſes, has ſent me, to ſhare them with you; whatever may be your ſorrows, when you are calmer you will confeſs them to me; and though I may not have the power to mitigate them, yet I will join my tears with yours, and by my ſympathy, aid you to bear them." There was in the manner, as well as the voice of the Counteſs, ſomething ſo faſcinating, ſo conſoling, and ſo perſuaſive, that the afflicted heart felt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and JULIA, ſomewhat ſoothed, ſuffered herſelf to be ſeated; her tears ſtill flowed, but they flowed in ſilence.</p>
               <p>In a few moments, a young man with a woman and two peaſants entered the room; the firſt appeared to be a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the deceaſed, and the two others, perſons whom he had brought with him, to perform the laſt duties to the

               <p>Here ſhe ended her relation, and the Counteſs thanked her for her narrative, and told her that ſhe ſhould return with her to the VILLA DE LAUNA. "I am rich, my dear, and of noble blood, (ſaid ſhe,) but they only ſerve to prove that riches cannot beſtow content, and nobility cannot confer happineſs: in the midſt of wealth and magnificence, I have been miſerable, and nothing but the hope of futurity, and a confidence that he who directs all things, cannot do wrong, could reconcile me one moment to life. I admire your ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, approve your conduct, and am glad that your edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation has been ſuch as to enlarge your mind and cultivate your ideas. In your ſociety I promiſe myſelf much pleaſure, and while I live, you ſhall not want a friend: ſay nothing, my dear; I know all you would ſay; but to liſten to the too greatful expreſſions of a feeling heart, would betray a civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that I hate, and receive a pain that is unneceſſary."</p>
               <p>JULIA now expreſſed a fear that the leaving of the Cottage would be a breach of her mother's commands: but Madam DE LAUNA convinced her of the impropriety and almoſt impoſſibility of her tarrying there unprotected, till the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of her uncle, who would moſt probably conſider her as an intruder, and treat her as ſuch. "There is no doubt, ſaid ſhe, a ſecret hangs over your birth; with me you will be ſecure; I am now going from Paris, where I have been to viſit a brother who has returned from an exile of many years, and a dying friend. I will introduce you at my houſe as a young Lady of whom I have the care, my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are faithful; leave this place in the care of Simon—I will write your uncle; and when he returns he will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly diſcloſe every thing that appears like an enigma; in the mean time I will do all in my power to make up to you the loſs of your Friends: and I again repeat, that in me you ſhall always find a friend.</p>
               <p>The next day the humble obſequies of the old Man were performed, and the ſweetly mournful countenance of JULIA attracted all the eyes of the ruſtic followers. The Counteſs walked by her ſide, and ſupported and incouraged her; the genuine dignity and highly poliſhed affability of Madam DE LAUNA; the richneſs of her dreſs, the ſimple and unador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beauty of JULIA; formed a ſtriking contraſt to the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:039134_0016_1013AF8F27174F18"/>
peaſant groap around her, and the humility of the Prieſt, his bald and reverend forehead, with his religious garb and fervent piety; the rural ſpot (but a few paces from the cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage) where Pierre was interred, formed a ſcene really pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureſque. When they returned from the funeral, the carriage was ready, the Counteſs had before given orders to Simon. She now put a purſe into the hand of the Prieſt, gave ſome money to the attending peaſants, and leading JULIA from the houſe, ſeated her in the carriage, and the farm and the Cottage were out of ſight in an inſtant.</p>
               <p>Madam DE LAUNA ſaw her young friend ſo wholly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed by a grief that ſhe knew to be entirely natural, that for ſometime ſhe forbore to offer any conſolation; deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to let nature have its full play, and ſenſible that the unadulterated mind of JULIA, would, if let alone, ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume its calmneſs.</p>
               <p>The mind of JULIA had indeed nothing to cope with, but ſorrow; ſhe knew too little of the world to be ſuſpicious, and her natural diſpoſition was too cheerful and to good to harbour any jealous thoughts. She had given herſelf up to the Counteſs without one fear, and in full confidence of her merit. In doing ſo, ſhe did but juſtice to her exalted virtues; but ſhe would have been full as likely to have truſted herſelf to the vicious and deſigning, who could have aſſumed the garb, and the appearance of active benevolence. But providence beheld the innocent girl unpractiſed in the ways of deceit; unacquainted with vice or folly, and ſent this worthieſt of women as a friend to comfort and protect her.</p>

               <head>HISTORY OF THE COUNTESS DE LAUNA.</head>
               <p>AS the Counteſs DE LAUNA will continue to make a conſiderable figure in the following pages, it may perhaps be not unneceſſary to give a few ſketches of her hiſtory, and tho' it is ſo blended with that of her brother the Marquis of ALVADA, we ſhall be pardoned by the candid, if ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of his are intermixed with it.</p>
               <p>The ancient family of ALVADA and DE LAUNA, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready become connected, and it was the fervent wiſh of the Count and the Marquis, that the titles, honors and eſtate, ſhould be ſtill more intimately blended; the reſpective ladies had been intimate friends from their birth, and with the enthuſiaſm natural to youth and innocence, they fell in with their huſband's plans, and looked forward with delight to that period, when their grand children ſhould be equally dear, becauſe equally attached to both. The Marquis AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VADA was bleſt with a ſon one year after his marriage; and the Counteſs DE LAUNA became a mother within two years; the children thus affianced in their cradles became fond of each other at an early age, and when the Counteſs preſented her huſband with a ſon in leſs than three years after the birth of her daughter, they only regretted that the Marchioneſs was not favoured with a daughter: this wiſhed for event did not take place, till young DE LAUNA was twelve years old. But this diſparity of age did not prevent theſe friendly and affectionate parents from indulging their favorite wiſh; and the Count determined at all events to preſerve the heart of his ſon, till CAMILLA, the daughter of the Marquis, was old enough to receive him: with this

                  </gap> ALVADA took place; that event was only delayed, till the young lady arrived at the age of fifteen. This marriage was preformed before all the dependents and vaſſals of both families; and many of the nobility and gentry were invited to be preſent at a ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that more ſtrongly united two noble families. As ſoon as the rejoicings that followed the wedding were over, young DE LAUNA was ſent abroad with a worthy tutor, who had ſtrict injunctions to prevent all intercourſe with the other ſex; to improve his mind and manners, and make him acquainted with every branch of knowledge uſeful, neceſſary or ornamental. But the joys of all connected were dreadfully damped by the death of the young bride, which followed the birth of a ſon; in a few days thus event haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that of the young <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

bore teſtimony of his piety; but it bore teſtimony likewiſe of his tenderneſs, and of the charms of SEIGNORA LAVINIA, a young lady poſſeſſed of a large fortune, deſcended from a family ancient and honorable. A lady, who had all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting ſimplicity of rural innocence, blended with all the grace and elegance of a court education, and trained beneath the eye of an aunt who was acknowledged the beſt and moſt accompliſhed woman in Italy. It is not ſurpriſing that LA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VINIA was all ſhe appeared; the pride and the delight of all that knew her. Surrounded by admirers of her own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſhe gave a decided preference to ALVADA; nor did her friends wonder at this preference, for his perſon was indeed graceful; his manners refined; his morals unimpeached; and his abilities ſuperior; with all the virtues engraven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his heart; he had received all the advantages of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent education; he was at that time more than thirty years old, and in becoming acquainted with LAVINIA, he ſoon experienced that tender, fervent attachment, that every heart of ſenſibility will at ſometime or other in their lives feel: he left her with vows of love and unerring truth, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in France juſt time enough to receive the parting breath of his father: determined to obey his dying command, he ſoon ſettled every thing to the ſatisfaction of his mother, and ſiſters, and in one year he returned to Italy, when LA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VINIA conſented to receive his vows at the ſacred Altar; in a few months before that time had elapſed, poor CAMIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LA. who ſeemed to be pointed out for wounds from all ſides, received a letter informing her of the death of her ſon; this loſs was an aggravation to her former troubles; but ſtill ſhe was ſupported, and behaved with a fortitude that did her hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, and when the Count DE LAUNA, returned after an abſence of ſixteen years, conſented to give him her hand in compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the promiſe ſhe had made her dying father; but previous to this ſtep, ſhe informed the Count of her prior attachment, and of its conſequence, the Count was one of thoſe rare characters in whom a ſenſe of honor ſuperſedes almoſt every other; the beauty of CAMILLA had engaged his attention; her virtues, and he felt the full force of a firſt love: But notwithſtanding that, he would have left her free from preſuaſion, if ORMOND had lived: he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired her frankneſs, and loved her the more for her candor; even the tears ſhe ſhed for his rival, endeared her to his heart, and leading her to the Altar, he thought he poſſeſſed

one of the greateſt bleſſings, and one of the brighteſt orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that had ever adorned the marriage ſtate. Upon his ſide it was productive of the pureſt delights; on her's it was calm and not unpleaſing; in giving him her hand, ſhe had obeyed a dying father, and a mother who loved her ſuperior to every earthly bleſſing: That mother ſhe loſt the fourth year after ſhe became Counteſs DE LAUNA, her huſband's increaſed aſſiduity and affection in ſome meaſure ſucceeded in making her forget her loſs; and eight years paſſed on happily: In that time the Marquis had brought home his beautiful and amiable wife: but at home he found thoſe troubles he had ſhunned abroad; his ſon now near twenty was profligate and wicked, he had art enough to hide both from his father, but not to conceal the chagrin he felt from his ſecond marriage, which he ſuppoſed would produce children to ſhare his fathers eſtate, if not wholly poſſeſs his affection; thus influenced by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and avarice, he refuſed to ſee his mother-in-law; and two years elapſed without an interview: his grand father had made him independent and he reſided upon his own eſtate; the Marquis often heard of his exceſſes and grieved at debaucheries he could not prevent. The mild and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſpirit of the Marchioneſs was affected by his malice and folly; but no unkind or repining word eſcaped her lips, and ſhe ſtrove to render her huſband and connections happy, by a conſtant perſeverance in every virtue; but illneſs ſeemed to effect what filial affection and duty had in vain ſtrove to perform. The Baron, (for his grand father had procured him a title) was ſeized with a violent fit of illneſs, which his phyſicians pronounced to be mortal on the fourth day; compunction then ſeized him, and notwithſtanding he was but newly initiated into the myſtery of the ſect that had given themſelves the title of ILLUMINATA, his conſcience told him it was no ſhield againſt the hand of death; it was then he ſent to beg his father and mother-in-law, to viſit him and receive his laſt ſigh; the Marquis and his lady obeyed the ſummons; an entire reconciliation took place, and ſuch was the effect that he recovered from his fever, but was ſuppoſed to be in a decline. As the human heart is never ſofter than when newly reconciled to an object al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways beloved, and for ſome reaſon neglected, ſo the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis ſeemed more attached than ever to his ſon; in the fear of his death he forgot all his errors; in the hope of his recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery he hoped he was cheriſhing recovered virtues.</p>

This proſpect gave the Marquis extreme plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and the Baron ſeemed to ſhare his parent's joy; but though his fond father was deceived, the Marchioneſs was not; as his ſickneſs abated, ſhe ſaw the depravity of his heart in a thouſand inſtances, and ſhe felt a grief that ſhe could ill conceal when the Marquis was obliged by the commands of the King to make a journey to the court of Spain; he had not been gone long when her uneaſineſs was increaſed, her ſuſpicions turned into certainties, and his conduct was ſo vile, that ſhe wrote her huſband, and the Counteſs DE LAUNA, but the letters were intercepted; the Marquis was at a diſtance, and when a rumour that ſhe was unhappy, reached the Counteſs, ſhe was juſt recovering from a ſick bed, and as ſoon as the Count could leave her, he ſet off for the Baron's; but alas! this lovely woman was no more. Two days before his arrival ſhe had expired, in conſequence of a premature labor: he deſired to ſee the corps, and though he examined it with a critical eye, he found nothing that could juſtify his ſuſpicions, that ſhe came to her death by any unfair means—this ſuſpicion was founded on a thorough knowledge of the Baron's cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; and ſome acquaintance, with a ſet of vain Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers he was connected with: but his apparent grief, the affirmation of the Phyſician that attended, and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that was with her, convinced him he was miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: her funeral was performed with great magnificence, but the Marquis' grief knew no bounds. He at firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like a man diſtracted, and for one year he continued in Spain, deprived of reaſon, and this was followed by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere melancholy. The death of her lovely ſiſter was a ſevere affliction to the Counteſs, they had thought and felt alike, and a ſimilarity of ſentiment had created and nurſed the moſt perfect and ſincere friendſhip. She mourned her loſs with tears of heartfelt ſorrow; but an event ſoon hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that called her mind from more diſtant affliction, and fixed them upon her own. Summoned to attend the Court upon the King's Marriage, ſhe went with her huſband and upon entering the drawing room, her eye was caught by
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:039134_0023_10136EB20F62C050"/>
never to be forgotten, her long loved and long mourned ORMOND. At firſt ſhe thought it a deluſion, a viſion of fancy, ſhe gazed with aſtoniſhment; ſhe doubted the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of her ſenſes; ſhe had believed him dead from the authority of his own brother. How then could this be? ſhe now ſaw him advancing toward her with a pale face indeed, hollow eyes; his eyes had loſt all their ſweetneſs of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the roſes of youth ſeemed blaſted upon his cheek by an untimely froſt; but they ſtill retained their fire, and fierceneſs, and ſorrow ſeemed to have taken the place of complacency and good humour: pride and haughtineſs had leſſened the reign of mildneſs and dignified humility. She made not theſe remarks; ſhe fainted, and her huſband with wonder and afflection, carried her from the preſence.—ORMOND, with an exclamation of ſurpriſe, followed: it was ſome time after her recovery that the aſtoniſhed Count could conceive the meaning of the ſcene to which he had been a witneſs. At length the behaviour of ORMOND, left him no room to doubt that he was his early rival in her affections, and ſtill living to diſpute his right. He loved his wife, he loved his honor, and a long train of diſtreſſing cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ruſhed upon his view. It is not our deſign to enlarge upon the ſcene, nor could the feeble pen do it juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. From ſome things that came to light after; and that a gentleman connected with the family related, it was learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the noble family of ORMOND could not brook the idea that the principal hope of their race ſhould be allied to a catholic; the marriage was illegal, performed without wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; the party under age; and no conſent from connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. ORMOND was deceived into a belief that CAMILLA was dead; and the Prieſt who performed the nuptials, aided the deceit: thus both unſuſpicious themſelves, were both deceived. ORMOND, had paſſed ſeveral years in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, and was recalled but fifteen months previous to this event, to take poſſeſſion of his title and eſtate, as his father was dead, and he was now choſen by the Court of Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Britain, to congratulate the king of France upon his nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials; the moment he ſaw the Counteſs he knew her, and with one retroſpective glance, he ſaw into the deception—but his temper was changed, he was no longer the amiable youth that CAMILLA had loved, and had ſhe ſeen him as he now appeared, DE LAUNA, had never known a rival; for his temper was revengeful, haughty &amp; overbearing, and unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:039134_0024_1013AFA0DC2FD200"/>
of her peace and quiet: The next day he ſent a challenge, couched in ſuch terms of defiance, that it was impoſſible not to accept of it; they met, fought, and DE LAUNA fell, covered with his own blood, and ſinking beneath a mortal wound; but ORMOND, eſcaped to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</p>
               <p>The terror, the grief of the Counteſs, is only to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the feeling mind, and not to be deſcribed. In a few weeks, with an heart broken by ſorrow, and a frame, ſhattered by illneſs, ſhe followed the remains of her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> to the VILLA DE LAUNA, nor had ſhe left it till within one month of the Commencement of this tale.—It is very neceſſary to add that the Duke of ORMOND had claimed her as his wife, and preſſed his ſuit with all the ardour of paſſion. But ſhe had ſteadily refuſed every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of this kind. Second marriages, ſhe diſliked from principle; but to wed the man whoſe hands were ſtained with her huſband's blood; was an idea too dreadful to be dwelt upon, and her heart ſickened at the thought. ORMOND was lately dead, and though it is probable ſhe felt ſome pangs at this event; certain it is that ſhe had been more calm ſince, than at any period of her widow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: Tried in the ſchool of affliction: tutored by the rough hand of ſorrow; ſhe now lived only for others; to bleſs a numerous train of dependents; to comfort the afflicted, to bind up the broken hearted, to pour the oil and wine of kindneſs and ſympathy into the boſom of the oppreſſed, was her buſineſs, and her pleaſure: and her ample fortune, gave her ſufficient power. She had never left the retirement that was endeared by her ſufferings, and by her happineſs, till called by the deſire of a dying friend, and the ſickneſs of her brother, who had returned to France not leſs wretched, though more calm; and whoſe afflictions were by no means leſſened by the conduct of his ſon: now the Count DE LAUNA, ſon to the BARON; this title deſcending to him, upon the death of his uncle. This was the woman who became the protector of JULIA, and to them we will after ſo long a digreſſion, return.</p>

               <p>FOR ſeveral hours after they left the Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, ſilence was obſerved by the Counteſs, and JULIA, continued abſorbed in unpleaſing reflections. But juſt as the Sun was ſetting they entered a little village; a ſight ſo novel attracted the eye of JULIA, and ſhe could not forbear an exclamation of ſurprize and wonder; to her the little town ſeemed the capital of the world, and the humble church near its centre; a building of immeaſurable magnitude. The Counteſs enjoyed her aſtoniſhment, and rather increaſed the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo natural to the inexperienced, and to the innocent mind: ſhe did not tell her that Paris was an hundred times larger, or that the Chateau DE LAUNA, was more magnificent than the little convent, at which ſhe meant to tarry for the night.</p>
               <p>She had been always acquainted with the AB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BESS, and loved and reſpected her perſon and her character, and had often ſaid if ſhe ſhould ever retire to a convent, which ſhe had once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated, it would be this: is not to be

doubted but ſhe met with a hearty and friendly welcome, and both Nuns and ſuperiors vied with each other to entertain the penſive and wondering JULIA, whom the Counteſs recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to their care, for the night; refreſhment and repoſe were highly neceſſary, and extremely welcome to the wearied frame of the unfortunate girl; but for ſome time her agitated mind for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bade its approach; wearied nature at length found it near midnight; and when JULIA awoke at ſunriſe, the next morning, ſhe found her mind calm, and her perſon reanimated with health, hope and ſpirits.</p>
               <p>She met the Counteſs in the parlor, and after the uſual ſalutations of the morning, they accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the invitation of the ABBESS, to join their early veſpers, which were performed to the admiration of JULIA. One of the ſiſters ſhowed her every apartment in the Nunnery; and in ſo doing oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and aſtoniſhed her, and filled her mind with ſenſations ſo intirely new, as almoſt to exclude her recent ſorrows, and furniſhed her with a fund of neceſſary and uſeful reflections for the day: at nine they bid adieu to theſe hoſpitable recluſes, and began a journey that was much more pleaſing than the preceding day.</p>
               <p>The eye of JULIA, which for years had been bounded by one narrow farm, was never ſatiſfied with gazing upon the vaſt horizon; the amazing tract of land, variegated by hills, meadows, woods and waters, attracted her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>tention; and though the proſpects in ſome parts were neither grand nor romantic, though the hand of induſtry had neither turned the globe, nor cultivated the ſoil for miles around; yet to her it was an inexhauſtible ſcene
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:039134_0027_1013AFAD64627400"/>
of delight and aſtoniſhment. As ſhe made her natural and lively remarks, the Counteſs liſtened with pleaſure, and ſaw with wonder the power of nature over an heart unuſed to the world. The minuteſt beauties did not paſs unnoticed, and what would have eſcaped the obſervation of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly cultivated mind, was to her a ſource of moralizing and enjoyment. You are extremely like a lovely woman, ſaid Madam DE LAUNA, who now ſleeps in the cold embrace of death; the ſame beauty, the ſame bewitching ſimplicity, the ſame native good ſenſe, and reflecting pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and to theſe ſhe added all the elegance of a Court, and poſſeſſed every virtue and every grace in an eminent degree; the likeneſs ſtruck me laſt evening, and this morning too, I could not but remark it. Nineteen years ago, (ſhe added with a ſigh,) I viſited this convent with her, my brother and huſband; we were all happy; compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively, I was ſo; for though I had bid adieu to thoſe flattering hopes of romantic felicity, that once flowed in my diſturbed imagination, yet, I was calm and contented, I enjoyed all the bleſſings of friendſhip, and one of the beſt of huſband's. The friend that poſſeſſed my warmeſt eſteem, and that huſband are long ſince ſecreted in the gloomy manſions of the grave; taken away by means the moſt ſhocking; ſacrificed to the baſeſt of paſſions. Forgive me my love; I pain you when I ſhould aſſuage the anguiſh of your heart, by a ſad retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of my ſorrows.—But I was going to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that you reminded me of that lady, and not withſtanding the difference of your lives and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations you think and ſpeak ſo much alike, that I almoſt fancied I ſaw her again; beheld once

more her fair frame, reanimated by life and reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all its former lovelineſs. When you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked the reſignation of the penſive Abbeſs, the paleneſs of the Nuns, the ſighs of the Novice, and the gloom of the Cloiſter, I heard her voice in your's and found your ſentiments ſo exactly what her's was, that I went back near twenty years and looked around for my huſband and brother: but alaſs! you are all that remains of joy to me: The fleeting viſion of the original and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt of men are no more; and my brother, by the cruel events of his life, is rendered uſeleſs to ſociety and burthenſome to himſelf. JULIA, with all the warmth of an affectionate heart, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the hand of her benefactreſs to her lips, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to cheer the ſpirits which were ſo low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered by reflections, by aſking queſtions that intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a converſation that laſted till they came within ſight of the VILLA DE LAUNA, and an involuntary exclamation of pleaſure and ſurpriſe burſt from her lips.</p>
               <p>The elegance, taſte, fancy and art that were here diſplayed; rural beauty mingled with gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur and magnificence, elevated the mind, while they charmed the eye: every neceſſary and real convenience were conſpicuous, and at the ſame time rendered ſo ornamental, that it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a perſon who had ſeen the world and been moſt acquainted with the grand, and the noble, not to admire it. The connoiſſeur and the critic ſought in vain for faults, and vainly wiſhed to find ſomething to blame, that they might diſplay their own talents: but they returned diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though not chagrined, for the hoſpitality and benevolence of the Counteſs, overpaid them for

               <p>What then muſt be the ſenſations of a girl of eighteen, who recollected no houſe, but a Cottage of two rooms, and whoſe ideas of the ſuperb, were formed from books, and the converſation of an old Man, of ſlender abilities, who knew but little; and a woman, whoſe mind was always too much agitated by misfortunes, to pretend to give infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation on architecture. She could not expreſs her ſurpriſe; ſhe found no words to tell her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, and ſhe was loſt in aſtoniſhment: The Counteſs ſo charmed with ſimplicity, and ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous expreſſions, almoſt forgot every thing that related to herſelf; but her vaſſals and dependents, by the teſtimonies they gave of joy at her return, convinced her that neither abſence nor misfortunes could efface from the grateful mind a ſenſe of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits received, when conferred in ſuch a manner as to convince the obliged they were conferring favors; ſhe could not receive ſuch proofs of their grateful affection without tears; they aſſembled around the carriage with their humble paſtor at their head to inquire for her health, and bleſs her for her return, while her ſmiles and affability were diſpenſing bleſſings and comforts around her. Oh, my dear Madam, ſaid JULIA, how rejoiced I am to find the world ſo good and ſo amiable, I had ſuppoſed that there were ſome wicked &amp; miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable amongſt them, but all thoſe people look ſo good and ſo happy, that I am ſure I have been deceived. How bleſt muſt you be in the power to render them ſo happy and ſo good, and ſo glad to ſee you too: I had no idea that the world was ſo amiable. The world, my love, ſaid the

Counteſs, you ſee but little of the world; but yet added ſhe, theſe humble and happy ruſtics, are an epitome of thee.</p>
               <p>They now alighted, and after inquiries for the welfare of all, Madam DE LAUNA ordered whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome food and liquors for them, and diſmiſſed them, with an invitation to dance upon the green that day fortnight. It was near night when they arrived, and ſoon after a ſlight repaſt, JULIA was conducted to her apartment, they conſiſted of a bed chamber, dreſſing room and cloſet, thoſe my dear (ſaid her benefactreſs) are yours, they have been fitted up for ſome time, and I have been in purſuit of an inhabitant for them, and am rejoiced that I have found ſo pleaſing an owner. The books, furniture, and muſical inſtruments are your own. Tomorrow I will furniſh a wardrobe for you, and here added ſhe, taking a ſmiling lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle girl that juſt then entered, is your attendant, ANNETT, you are henceforth to obey this young lady, and ſee that you do nothing to diſpleaſe her.

Not one word, my dear, as you value my eſteem, you are my friend, my companion, and as ſuch my equal, and not a ſervant.

               <p>The next day JULIA attended the Counteſs in ſeveral viſits of charity, and beheld the effuſions of benevolence and gratitude with ſo much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and a pleaſure ſo new, that ſhe began to think her very being was changed, and that her heart was filled with ſenſations to which ſhe muſt have ever been a ſtranger: but for her excellent friend; the native condeſcenſion of her heart, that humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſoul, which the amiable delight to cheriſh and encourage, taught her to be affable to all around her, while the innate dignity of conſcious rectitude and conſcious honor, forbade every thing like ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility or meanneſs. She ſoon grew beloved by the ſervants and every day rendered her more dear to the Counteſs. She was never tired of ramb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling over the pleaſure grounds, of ſetting under groves of Orange, Lemon or Citron, or attending to the feathered ſongſters, that every hour ſerenad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, nor had the lombardy Poplar, the lofty beach, the graceful Elm, and the venerable Cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut, leſs beauties, becauſe intermixed with leſs plenteous exotics; they were all ſurveyed with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm and delight, and ſhe literally "looked through nature. up to nature's God."</p>
               <p>The Counteſs had real pleaſure in informing her mind, and felt a ſincere ſatisfaction in making her acquainted with every thing that could either pleaſe or impro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

There is nothing that more endears an amiable dependent to a truly generous heart, than a knowledge of that very dependence, and a ſenſe that it is in the power of the benefactor to render the obliged intirely happy: ſuch were the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs, and JULIA, and a ſenſe of obligations on one ſide, and a wiſh to oblige, joined to good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, frankneſs and good abilities, all concurred to cement the affection which they naturally felt for each other; thus grateful and affectionate, JULIA paſſed four weeks tranquil and happy, the peaſants had their ball, and ſhe was delighted that ſhe had learned to dance; but till now had never been a partaker of the pleaſing exerciſe and now at the deſire of her patroneſs, ſhe danced and found the muſic ſo animating and ſo agreeable that ſhe enjoyed it highly.

               <p>ABOUT three weeks after, the Counteſs was informed, that a ſtranger wiſhed to ſpeak with her; ſhe ordered him to be admitted, and was ſurpriſed, to ſee a Man near forty years old, who was an entire ſtranger to her. What are your commands, friend? ſhe aſked. The man replied, he had waited upon her by her own direction, upon account of a letter, which he then held in his hand, and which he ſaid he had received three weeks ſince. The Counteſs immediately recollected the letter ſhe had written from the Cottage, to JULIA's uncle. Are you the ſon of <hi>Monſieur</hi> PIERRE? (ſaid ſhe.) I am, Madam, he replied. 'Tis my uncle exclaimed JULIA, in a tone of pleaſure; and ſhe aroſe and advanced towards him; he ſtepped a little back and repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, no, young lady, I have not that honor. How! cried the Counteſs, did not you ſay your name was PIERRE, the ſon of the old man, who died at AVIGNON. I am his ſon, Madam, but ſtill I have not the honor to be related to that young Lady; 'tis upon that account that I have come here, otherways I ſhould not have been ſo bold, and given you this trouble. After a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's heſitancy, the Counteſs rejoined, this young
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:039134_0034_1013AFBF4F4A4E80"/>
lady was the grand-daughter of your Father; her relationſhip would reflect honor upon any one; why then do you deny her as a neice? ſhe wants nothing of you. Excuſe me, Madam, ſaid the man, and you Mademoiſelle, pray, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, I ſhould think myſelf highly honored by being your uncle, for I am a poor man. a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; and you a fine young lady; but I ſhould act a diſhoneſt part were I to ſay I am your uncle. Who are you then, interrogated the Counteſs, &amp; who is ſhe? if ſhe has been deceived, act a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous part, and undeceive her. She now ſaw JULIA almoſt ſinking under her various emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; Emotions too ſtrong not to be impreſſed upon her face. Do not give way to theſe agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions my dear, cried the kind, the feeling woman, I will always be your friend, and you ſhall never know the want of a relation. I know your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and I feel it, Madam, but do forgive this weakneſs; to find myſelf denied by the only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that I could claim as a relation. She would have proceeded, but tears ſtopped her utterance. The Counteſs again demanded of PIERRE, who ſhe was? He ſtopped a few minutes, as recollecting himſelf, at length he ſaid, my father was a poor, a very poor man, he never had any child, but my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; my mother died when I was but three days old; my father was never married again: when I was twelve years old he put me out as a lackey, to attend upon the Chevalier St. ENNO: and he himſelf was entertained as a ſervant to the young Baron DE LAUNA. I went with my maſter to CLEAVES, and never ſaw my Father until I was twenty years old; he then came to viſit me, and
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:039134_0035_1013AFC48BEFE880"/>
told me he had quitted the BARON's ſervice, and was obliged to change his name; he ſaid he had the care of a woman, and a little girl, who owned a farm at AVIGNON, and that he ſhould in future live upon it; but as he did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the cultivating of it himſelf, he ſhould keep a ſervant. When I aſked him who this woman was, he ſaid ſhe went by the name of VALLACE, but that was not her real name, and ſhe was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to take great care to conceal herſelf and child, as its life would be in danger if diſcovered; my Father told me that he depended upon my ſecrecy, and charged me in my letter never to mention it to any one but ourſelves. I have liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſixteen years at CLEAVES, with a <hi>Monſieur</hi> D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>NVILLE, and have written my Father regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly once a year; his anſwer always told me he was well, and that he wanted for nothing; this made me quite eaſy; but when I heard by SI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MON of his ſudden death, and from your lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's letter found I was ſuppoſed to be heir to what he left, I thought it was my duty to inform you of the truth; as to this young lady, ſhe is the right owner of the little land my father cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated, and the houſe he lived in, and I wiſh it was as much again, for your ſake Mademoiſelle; for SIMON tells me that you were very kind to my Father, and if it is in my power ever to ſerve you, I ſhall be glad and ready.</p>
               <p>Both JULIA and the Counteſs continued ſome time in a ſtate of aſtoniſhed ſilence; at length the former thanked him for his good wiſhes, and aſked how ſhe ſhould proceed. I am pleaſed with your honeſty, my friend, you ſhall not loſe

                  </gap> I am not ſurpriſed at what you told me, I never ſuppoſed JULIA what ſhe appeared; I will take it upon me to ſay, the Farm and the Cottage are yours, with all that belong to it; I only beg you will be ſilent concerning this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair; if you can leave your ſervice, I ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe you to reſide at the late habitation of your father; I am perſuaded you can make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable ſupport from the land that ſurrounds it, and if we ſhould want your evidence, we ſhall know where to apply. JULIA confirmed the promiſe of her benefactreſs, and as ſoon as PIERRZ left them, he took poſſeſſion of his new abode, and was from that moment a faithful adherent to the Counteſs.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as he left the room, Madam DE LAUNA embraced her young friend with expreſſions of the tendereſt ſatisfaction; I am afraid, my dear, (ſaid ſhe) that I am ſo little minded as to feel what is called family pride; I am almoſt aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to confeſs that I already love you better than when I ſuppoſed you were deſcended from old PIERRE. Do not miſtake me, in imagining that I can ſuppoſe any grade of life, however lowly, excludes the virtues, nor that there is any, but is at ſome times graced with all that's good and amiable; but I cannot help thinking theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances very rare; this I do not impute ſo much to any original defect, as to the effects of a narrow and confined education; the ſociety to which they are habituated; and the narrow ſphere in which they move. I thought from my firſt ſeeing you, that you could not be in any ſhape related to the man of the Cottage, and I have
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:039134_0037_1013AFC8BA5048A0"/>
no doubt you are deſcended from, or connected with ſome of our chief Nobility; I doubt it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much, (cried JULIA,) but I am not enough acquainted with the world to diſpute the juſtice of your remark; though I own my dear Madam that there is a <hi>forlornneſs</hi> in the idea of not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the acknowledged relation of one perſon in the world; of not knowing one perſon in whoſe veins one drop of my blood <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lows; that is ſo painful, that I would gladly barter it, for what I ſhould feel to know myſelf nearly related to one of your honeſt tenants. Conceive yourſelf relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me, then (ſaid the Counteſs,) call me by the endearing appellation of Mother, conſider me as ſuch, and no one will prove a tenderer one. Oh! my Child, if my ſon had lived, I ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be a mother, but providence has denied me ſuch a bleſſing. I ſhould be ungrateful to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, replied JULIA, if I did not acknowledge the vaſt, the mighty bleſſing I received; forgive then my revered, my beloved benefactreſs, this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary laſpe of gratitude, you are indeed more than a mother to me. Such was the tide of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent that ſo tenderly ruſhed upon her, that to have reſtored the child of the Counteſs, ſhe felt ſhe would have given up her own life, and ſuch was the ſimilarity of emotions that ſwelled in both boſoms, that the Counteſs conceived without explanation the full force of her virtue and gratitude.</p>
               <p>To diſſipate theſe ſenſations, ſhe propoſed an airing, and after a pleaſing ride of ſeveral hours, in which their eyes had been regaled by the moſt delightful views, and their ſpirits refreſhed and
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:039134_0038_1013AFCA42946298"/>
enlivened by the cool air and fragrant breeze; when upon their return, ſhe ordered her ſervants to drive back of the little road, and croſs the river where it was fordable. She here pointed out ſome proſpects that JULIA had never ſeen, and ſuch a univerſal harmony ſeemed to pervade all nature, that every painful idea was ſucceeded by calmneſs &amp; tranquillity. But this tranquillity was interrupted by the horſes taking fright at the fall of a tree upon the oppoſite ſide, and in ſpite of the driver's endeavours turned down the ſtream, and were in a moment beyond their depth; and the carriage inſtantly overturned. JULIA was uppermoſt, and the ſervant who retained his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of mind, burſt open the door of the coach, and with difficulty dragged her out and drew her to the ſhore. Quite exhauſted with his burden, and heavy with his wet and cumberous clothes, he could do no more, and the Counteſs muſt have inevitably periſhed; but the ſudden appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a young man raiſed a hope in his mind: for God's ſake (he cried in a convulſive agony,) <hi>Monſieur,</hi> ſave my Lady, ſhe is drowning in yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der carriage. The impetuous ſtranger waited not, but plunging into the water, he was in a moment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by its ſide. The horſes were by this time cleared from their tackling, and had diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared with the driver; the coach was full of water, and the Counteſs ſunk ſenſeleſs to the bottom; the intrepid youth entered, and with great difficulty forced her from it, and in a few minutes brought her to the ſhore; but not one ſymptom of life or animation, flattered them with remaining life. By this time ſeveral ſtout
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:039134_0039_1013AFCE2E8D2510"/>
woodmen were collected, and the Ladies by the direction and aſſiſtance of the young ſtranger, were conveyed to a ſmall cottage cloſe by the edge of the wood. The extreme ignorance of the people was ſuch, that they now thought they had done every thing that could be done, and but for the perſevering care of her deliverer, his former exertions had been thrown away; the ſurgeon had been ſent for from the Villa, but before his arrival, the aid that was then neceſſary, would be no longer needful; he ordered two countrywomen that were in the woodman's cot, to undreſs and put both the ladies into a warm, but very coarſe bed, and with vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, that were found in the pockets of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs, he aſſiſted to rub their temples and hands; in a few moments JULIA recovered, but when ſhe ſaw her friend and protectreſs, apparently dead, her agony became extreme, and ſhe relapſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a ſtate of inſenſibility. The young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman with active and humane zeal, diſtributed his care and attention alike to each; It was more than half an hour before the Counteſs gave the leaſt ſymptom of returning life; and then it was ſo very weak and faint, that one leſs animated than her preſerver, would have given up the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt as hopeleſs, and improbable. But his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions were continued till ſhe opened her eyes, and attempted to aſk where ſhe was. At that moment the ſurgeon arrived, he immediately opened a vein, and gave her a cordial, which ſhe ſwallowed with ſome difficulty, and JULIA who had now recovered a ſecond time, had the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible joy to hear him ſay ſhe would be quite
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:039134_0040_1013AFD22D5E8C38"/>
well in an hour; in this, however, his ſanguine hopes outran his judgment, for though ſhe recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered her voice and recollection, ſhe was ſtill weak and dangerouſly ill. JULIA, my love, ſaid ſhe, where are we? and what place is this, that we are got to? I thought we were in the water; I am ſick and dizzy; I believe I have had a dreadful dream. The emotions of JULIA were ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived her of the power of expreſſion, ſhe could only claſp her arms around her and weep; joy, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, gratitude, fear and hope, alternately aſſerted their power, and ſuch a variety of ſenſations, ſtruggled at once for vent, that her reaſon was almoſt overpowered. To calm the tumults of her mind, and to ſatisfy the Counteſs, the ſurgeon gave her an account of her danger and eſcape, and begged her to be compoſed. An opiate which he adminiſtered, had the effect he wiſhed, and after a few hours repoſe, the Counteſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it her intention to return to the VILLA, and begged her deliverer would accompany her. The young man heſitated for a few moments; he felt it would look as though he wiſhed for thanks, and perhaps reward, for an act of human<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, that he would have performed with equal avidity, for the beggar or the king, for his friend and his enemy; and his heart which was warm and generous, revolted at the idea; but that heart was ſuſceptible to the charms of beauty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, and he felt himſelf drawn by a power that he did not comprehend, for till now he had never given a decided preference, to any one of the ſex; nor did he underſtand the nature of a charm ſo ſweet at to be irreſiſtable, in the preſſing
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:039134_0041_1013AFD3CFC47408"/>
invitation he received. A coach and attendants were ſent from the Villa, and Madam DE LAUNA felt a ſincere joy to hear that her ſervant had been ſaved, though both of the horſes were drowned. She now rewarded every perſon who had been ſo active in aſſiſting her; and at nine in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arrived at Villa. Her ſervants had been told ſhe was dead, and moſt of them, with many of her vaſſals had come with agonizing hearts to the wood, and nothing but the abſolute injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſurgeon, and his declaration that her perfect recovery, depended upon the calmneſs of her mind, could moderate their joy, at finding her alive. But thoſe that had not left the houſe, when they ſaw her, became quite frantic, and made the air reſound with their acclamations of pleaſure, and their conduct upon this occaſion was the moſt convincing proof of her goodneſs and their affection. They got around her deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erer, and were ſo clamorous in their demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of gratitude, that one leſs intereſted or leſs amiable, would have turned with diſguſt from them. But the innate benevolence of FRANCIS COLWORT, his love of merit, the noble frankneſs of his diſpoſition, were ſuch, that he enjoyed thoſe tranſports that gave him an high idea of the worth of the Counteſs, and of her young companion. JULIA, who was intirely recovered, refuſed to leave the apartment of her friend for the night; but it was with great reluctance that her conſent was granted.</p>
               <p>Mr. COLWORT, was conducted to the beſt apartment, by the houſekeeper, who wiſhed him every bleſſing, and left him in poſſeſſion of the
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:039134_0042_1013AFD694B014E0"/>
beſt and greateſt; an heart pleaſed with having performed an act of humanity, and a conſcience void of offence.</p>
               <p>The next morning the Counteſs was not well enough to breakfaſt in the parlour, but ſhe ſent to requeſt her gueſt would take his morning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt in her dreſſing room. Both ſhe and JULIA were prepared to eſteem a man who had rendered them ſo eſſential a ſervice. For JULIA, her heart was ſo grateful, and ſhe viewed the benefit ſhe had received as of ſo vaſt a magnitude, that had he been old, ugly and deformed, her glowing imagination would have painted him young, lovely and amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But the aid of imagination was intirely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary to add one charm, or one grace, to the manly form and intelligent countenance of FRANCIS COLWORT. In that countenance, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imated by good ſenſe and benevolence; ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the index of one of the beſt of minds, and a counterpart of her own, where virtue and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine dignity of ſoul, preſided; and a high ſenſe of honor ſparkled in his eyes; courage tempered by diſcretion; good humour, untinctured by meanneſs or ſervility, and a frankneſs that did not even border upon inſolence or ill manners; and when he entered the apartment, with a ſtep firm, and a manner majeſtic; with a graceful, modeſt and eaſy dignity; it is not at all ſurpriz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="47" facs="unknown:039134_0043_1013AFD94276C878"/>
been ſo fortunate as to ſave was ſo valuable; as he aſſured her, he ſhould have taken the ſame care of the moſt inſignificant of his fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and her heart, which was pained by the ſenſe ſhe had of the obligation ſhe was under, became quite calm and eaſy; and after a few minutes the converſation turned upon general to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pics, and the forenoon was paſſed in the ſocial, familiar manner, that is ſo endearing to old friends, and minds of ſimilar ſentiments; mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally pleaſed with each other at the firſt ſight: ſenſible of the pleaſure of obliging, and being obliged. A few hours made them acquainted with the worth of each other, and they were in that time mutually charmed. With frankneſs and without heſitation, in anſwer to the Counteſs inquiries, he informed her that he had come to France, upon ſome buſineſs for an uncle, who had been the guide of his youth; as he had at a very early period loſt his parents, that he had performed the affairs that called him from <hi>London,</hi> and now meant to ſpend a few weeks in rambling over the country, previous to his return, and that he ſoon intended to make a voyage to America. My uncle wiſhes me to go into trade, [ſaid he,] becauſe he has accumulated a large property by traffic, and I wiſh to viſit a great people whoſe ſtruggles for liberty, have emancipated ſeveral millions from tyranny and oppreſſion; who have laws without an arbitrary government, and liberty without anarchy and confuſion.

correſpondence, my plans will not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere with my uncle's, and I flatter myſelf we ſhall both be gratified. But does not the length of the voyage affright you (ſaid the Counteſs,) by no means Madam, he replied. In what time can it be performed, (aſked JULIA,) he informed he that it did not uſually exceed five weeks, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe winds, he added, ſometimes rendered it four times as long. What an amazing while, (ſighed JULIA,) to be toſſed upon the boſom of the deep; and yet I think a view of the boundleſs Ocean uninterrupted by any other object, muſt be ſublime. I think ſo too, cried the youth, and own I wiſh to behold it; and yet its ſameneſs muſt tire a vacant mind, or a mind that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in purſuit of novelty. But a mind, young man, (replied the Counteſs,) that always carries about a fund of knowledge, and uſeful entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will never be tired of viewing the grand and the ſublime works of nature. It ſurpriſes me, ſaid COLWORT, that ſo many of its real beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties paſs unnoticed, except by few; we ſee every day the riſing and ſetting ſun, but how is this grand object unnoticed, except by few, and the heart alive to enthuſiaſm and delight, can never ſee them without renewed rapture and delight, and the ſenſations muſt be unutterable, when in all its majeſty it is beheld withdrawing its ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor from this our horizon, and retiring to bleſs and enlighten other regions. I can never (ſaid JULIA,) behold its ariſing without a pleaſure that I have no words to expreſs. It reminds me of ſome truly noble and worthy heart, who ſets out in the morning determined to fulfill all the
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:039134_0045_1013AFDEA4342488"/>
duties of the day, to bleſs and make all they meet happy. The ſame ſimile holds good at its ſetting, (rejoined COLWORT,) for it retires, like the excellent perſon you mention, ſatiſfied with having done right, and in all the majeſty and pride of virtue: But ladies, I fear I intrude; I ſhall carry away ſome of the ſweeteſt and moſt refined impreſſions, and if I could hope to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered by you, it would ſhorten and ſweeten my voyage. You are not going (ſaid the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs?) indeed I ſhall not permit it. I ſhall tarry in France but one fortnight, Madam. Tarry here then; you have ſeen the Capital, and from hence you may ramble around the country; we will either walk, or ride with you. I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to take a little tour, for ſome time, for the ſake of my young friend: with you added to our party, we ſhall receive much more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and pleaſure too. If I conſult only my own heart, Madam, I ſhall gratefully accept your invitation; for I am ſure I muſt be happier here, than elſewhere; but I fear I ſhall intrude upon your goodneſs. Leave that to me, replied the Counteſs, JULIA knows my heart, and ſhe ſhall tell you when you intrude.</p>

               <p>IN the afternoon JULIA played upon her harpſicord and accompanied it with a voice ſoft, ſweet and harmonious: COLWORT found a flute; he joined the little concert, and the judicious ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections of ſongs added ſentiment to the charms of melody. After ſome time ſpent in this ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and pleaſing amuſement, they left their inſtruments, and COLWORT aſked the Counteſs if ſhe was extravagantly fond of muſic. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay that I am, ſhe replied; I love a little of it; a good ſong and a ſweet voice, pleaſes me; when I uſed to dance, I admired the violin; the ſound was enlivening; with church muſic, I am delighted; it is a part of the ſervice that ought never to be omitted, or abridged: it excites de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, it elevates the heart, and it ſoftens thoſe religioniſts that are either too auſtere, or too ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid, and I own I am always an enraptured liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. How comes it about, Madam, cried COL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WORT, that performers of muſic, or thoſe who poſſeſs that art are ſo often addicted to vices? is it not becauſe it ſoftens the heart, and debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates the natural fortitude of the mind, and leaves it expoſed to pleaſures that enervate the nobleſt faculties of the ſoul? Your remark is new (ſhe replied) and I believe juſt, for I have obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

the votaries of ſenſuality, are generally attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it; I have never thought with your SHAKESPEARE, that the "man who hath not muſic in his heart, is fit for treaſons, robberies and murders:" It is an illiberal remark: I have found many perſons who had neither ear nor taſte for muſic, and yet poſſeſſed every virtue: When ſentiment is expreſſed by an harmonious voice, and an amiable countenance which has breathed harmony of ſoul and ſweetneſs of diſpoſition; I am a warm admirer of it, but am aſhamed when I hear people talk of dying, of fainting, merely at the magic of ſweet ſounds and I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt perſuaded that the charms of a rational and refined converſation will be preferred by all who are capable of joining in it.</p>
               <p>The next week was ſpent in excurſions around the country, and as the Counteſs was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well, JULIA, at the deſire of her friend ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied COLWORT either in the carriage, on horſe back, or in his walking rambles, and every moment paſſed together, ſerved to endear them to each other, by diſcovering a ſimilarity of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, taſte, and diſpoſition; they almoſt forgot the hours of retirement before they parted at night; and they aroſe early in the morning to meet with renewed pleaſure, to communicate ſome remark, or ſome idea, that had occurred ſince they parted, or which had been before for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</p>
               <p>One week flew by, on wings of down; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had paſſed imperceptibly, and a third was nearly elapſed; the Counteſs beheld a growing attachment, and ſhe beheld it with pleaſure and

approbation; ſhe marked its progreſs with ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and reſolved to render it happy. She obſerved one day a cloud upon the face of COL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WORT, and aſked the cauſe; I have been in a dream of bliſs, for I had almoſt forgotten the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of one who is entitled to my love, reſpect &amp; gratitude, (he replied,) but this moment reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions has come to my aid, and reminded me of my duty. I ſee you are ſurprized, and I am ſure you will forgive me, if I explain the cauſe of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> only regret, that I can know in your company. My uncle has only one child, a lovely daughter, who was till within two years, the principal pride and pleaſure of his life; but ſhe formed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection that has blaſted all his hopes in her. She married a man totally unworthy of her, and went with him to America: ſhe is now in deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute circumſtances, deſerted by her huſband, and ſuffering all the ſtings of poverty in a foreign country. It is to bring home the unfortunate ELEANOR, to reſtore her to parental love, and protection; that is my principal inducement to go to America. It was the thought of her woes and of her father's ſorrows, that embittered one moment ſpent here. Before he had finiſhed, or they had time to comment upon this informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a ſervant entered with a letter from his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle: he opened and read it without one apology, and found it was time to leave the enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Villa, and return to the affairs of the world; but he could not help betraying ſome emotion, his countenance became more ſoftened. Both the ladies aſked if he had received any bad news; yes, indeed, ſaid he, I have, though I
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:039134_0049_1013AFE86C08E748"/>
ought not to think it ſo; but I am ſummoned directly to London, the ſhip in which I embark for America, ſails in ten days, and tomorrow I muſt attend the calls of duty and leave thoſe I love beſt upon earth. If that is the caſe, ſaid the Counteſs, why then do you leave us? why take this hated voyage? you are ſenſible of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing debt I owe you; and if I know any thing of the human heart, you will be happier here than elſewhere; ſuffer me then to fix you here for life, or if you prefer England, there is no need of going to America, to eſtabliſh your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. I conſider you as my children, and as ſuch I ſhall ſpeak to you; I know you do not wiſh to impoſe upon each other, or deceive me: I am perhaps better acquainted with the progreſs that a tender affection has made in your hearts than you are yourſelves: It is innocent, my ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able friends, and you need not be aſhamed of it; I have been an intereſted obſerver, from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you firſt met, till now; I am drawn towards you both, by cords that I do not perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; but let the ſentiment be derived from what ſource it will, I own I love you both, better than I do any other object, and I would ſeign render you happy: I will leave you for a few moment, and then return to hear upon what you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided; only remember this, that an ample for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune waits your acceptance; and that whatever place you fix upon, for your abode, I will be either an inmate, or a neighbor.</p>
               <p>She went out, before either COLWORT or JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIA, could recover from their aſtoniſhment, to attempt expreſſing either gratitude or acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edgement.
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:039134_0050_1013AFEB4FC5EB08"/>
COLWORT emboldened by this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening, waited but a few moments, till the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous confuſion of his heart had in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſubſided, before he made an avowal of an attachment as ſincere and tender, as it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſioned, JULIA liſtened almoſt ſinking with bluſhes, and fluttering with a rapture till then unknown; his words vibrated upon her ear; they conveyed to her heart the ſofteſt, ſweeteſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and though overpowered by the impreſſion, yet ſhe would not have exchanged the ſenſation for any other ſhe had ever known; unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the world, coquetry and prudery were equally ſtrangers to her unadulterated mind, and ſhe had attained that happy medium which is the reſult of pure nature, and with a frankneſs and modeſty untinctured by art or affectation; ſhe acknowledged a preference to his virtues and his perſon, of which ſhe had till then been a ſtranger, and which ſhe believed would continue as long as her life; but ſhrinking from conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhe told him the little ſtory of her former days, and owned herſelf unacknowledged by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny relation, friend, or protector except the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs, to whoſe humanity, ſhe was indebted for all the advantages ſhe enjoyed; while COLWORT admired the native honor of her unſullied mind, he loved her the better for her misfortune and frankneſs, and her narrative had raiſed Madam DE LAUNA, to a pinnacle of excellence in his eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that no one had ever attained to before.</p>
               <p>Their converſation was broken off by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the lady, that now occupied almoſt an equal ſhare of their eſteem; but in attempting
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:039134_0051_1013AFECD14C3130"/>
to expreſs his thanks, he found it impoſſible to do juſtice to his feelings; he then confeſſed that his voyage to America was inevitable; that gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and affection to his uncle, required it; and declared he thought he ſhould never be happy, though equally bleſt by love, friendſhip and affluence, until he had reſtored his unhappy couſin, to the arms of her parents; he promiſed however that ſix months at fartheſt ſhould return him to the Villa, and then it JULIA would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his hand, he would ſettle in any part of England or of France, that was agreeable to JULIA and her benefactreſs; that his own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, though limited, was not dependant upon another, and he ſhould chuſe to depend upon his own exertions, for increaſing it, rather than upon the bounty of any one. I own to you Madam, (ſaid he) that bound to you both by the ties of gratitude and affection, that poſſeſſed of every other wiſh of my heart, I ſhould not be happy unleſs bleſt with your ſociety; I have now, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, made a candid confeſſion of my heart, thoughts and ſituation, and you will judge if I ought not to purſue the plan I had originally laid down; I make a ſacrifice indeed, but where would be the virtue in performing my duty, if I did not; love, friendſhip, eſteem, gratitude and intereſt, bid me ſtay in this delightful ſpot; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain gratitude and honor bid me leave it, for a while, but I truſt to return ſhortly and part from you no more: ſuffer me my beloved JULIA, and do not let your delicacy ſhrink from the avowal, to call you mine, ſuffer me in the preſence of this beſt of women to ſwear, eternal fidelity and amity
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:039134_0052_1013AFF201BC07E0"/>
to you, and let her witneſs an exchange of vows, leſt if either, ſhould ſuffer one light or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant thought, to interfere with its truth, this benefactreſs and friend, ſo intereſted for both, may be an evidence againſt us. I cannot but approve your intention, (ſaid the Counteſs,) tho' I grieve at the neceſſity that tears you from us; I will be reſponſible for JULIA, I will be reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for you, and I hope before the expiration of a year, to give you to each other, and ſee you united beyond the power of ought, but death, to ſeparate you.</p>
               <p>It would be only a repetition of what has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been repeated a thouſand times, to go in to a detail of what paſſed between JULIA, and her lover. He took his leave of her the next day, after promiſing to write long and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial letters, and with an heart filled with love, gratitude, admiration and regret, left the VILLA DE LAUNA, for Calais, at which place he meant to take a packet for Dover.</p>
               <p>The Counteſs and JULIA, felt a vacancy in their hearts, after his departure, that was painful, nor was the void filled up by finding his place at the table deſerted; ſo forcibly were their minds impreſſed at his abſence, his intended voyage, and the dangers which imagination preſented as his attendants, that whether, walking or riding, he was the continued ſubject of converſation; a topic which never tired them.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as he arrived in London, he wrote them, and though his letters were of neceſſity ſhort, they very forcibly expreſſed the ſenſations of his heart. Before they received theſe letters,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:039134_0053_1013AFF398A78218"/>
he muſt have been ſeveral days upon his paſſage; yet every change of weather was obſerved and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to; and JULIA never looked at the moon, but ſhe thought her eſteemed COLWORT might at that moment be contemplating the ſame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: his miniature that he had ſent her from London, was her conſtant companion, and the day after ſhe had received it, the Counteſs came into her dreſſing room with another picture in her hand; look here JULIA, ſaid ſhe, holding it up, whoſe likeneſs is this? Dear Madam (ſaid the ſurprized girl) it is Mr. COLWORT, did he ſend it to you, it is indeed a great reſemblance; yes (rejoined the Counteſs) it is a reſemblance, but I dare ſay taken before his birth; this picture, my dear, was deſigned for the man I loved as fondly as you do Mr. COLWORT, though not with ſo much prudence: May he never change as the original of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

I ſaw the amazing reſemblance on the firſt of your lover's arrival, (continued Madam) &amp; am almoſt aſhamed to own that my partiality for the CHEVALIERE ariſes in ſome meaſure from his likeneſs to the unfortunate author of all my ſorrows; at firſt I ſuppoſed there muſt have been ſome relationſhip; but upon inquiries, I found he was wholly a ſtranger, except from report to the family of ORMOND, but it is really ſurpriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that two perſons, no ways connected by the ties of blood, can be ſo much alike. JULIA

ſaw that her friend was much affected, and though no ſubject could be more pleaſing to her; though ſhe would have delighted to trace the cauſe of this reſemblance, from feature to fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yet ſhe turned the ſubject to ſome other, and aſked ſome queſtions that no way concerned her, only as they ſerved to withdraw the mind of the Counteſs from ſee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <p>NOTHING happened for ſeveral weeks worth relating; but one morning when JULIA went into the chamber of the Counteſs, ſhe found her ſo much indiſpoſed, that her affectionate heart took an immediate alarm. Madam ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared calm and compoſed, and though ſhe would not acknowledge herſelf ſo ill as ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, yet ſhe told JULIA, that ſhe was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of a ſever, and informed her that a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of years before, ſhe had been attacked in the ſame manner, and that though her life was then ſpared, the phyſicians had declared ſhe could never ſurvive ſo cruel a diſtemper in future. I have a preſage (ſaid ſhe) that I ſhall not recover;—I wiſh to perform ſome neceſſary buſineſs, and to ſend for an advocate from the next town: I have neglected this duty to along, and fear my reaſon will not be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> to perform it now.</p>
               <p>The grief of the affectionate JULIA, cannot be deſcribed, but it did not for one moment pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent her fulfilling every duty of friendſhip. When the phyſician arrived <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> looks were cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by anxiety, his anſwers doubtful, and he even urged the Counteſs to finiſh her worldly buſineſs
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:039134_0056_1013AFFE0BFFFDB0"/>
as ſoon as poſſible. This was only to make a will, in which ſhe bequeathed JULIA, fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand crowns, and the like ſum to COLWORT: the reſidue of her noble fortune, excepting lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies which were large and liberal, to her ſervants, would devolve upon her brother, the Marquis ALVADA, and his ſon the Count DE LAUNA.</p>
               <p>When the ſervants knew that their miſtreſs was making a will, they filled the houſe with their lamentations, and every apartment echoed with their affliction; as for JULIA, her's were ſilent, and tho' her grief was not of the boiſterous kind, her ſorrows were deep and afflictive. She attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the bedſide of her friend every moment, and preſented every medicine to her lips, her ſoft hands fixed the pillow that ſupported her throb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing head, and wiped the damp drops from her forehead &amp; temples, her arm was always ready to aſſiſt her, and when ſhe fixed and placed the bed and clothes, a kind of tranſient <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aſe ſeemed to follow.</p>
               <p>The Marquis &amp; Count were ſent for, but before this was done, the Counteſs loſt her reaſon, &amp; ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered all the pangs that the <hi>delirium</hi> of a fever could inflict, the phyſicians were detained at the Villa, &amp; for ſome days a conflict was maintained between a good conſtitution and a dreadful diſorder, and which would get the victory was doubtful; upon the ninth day after ſhifting her poſition a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times, ſhe ſunk into a deep ſleep, in which ſhe continued for ſix hours, the phyſician ſat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one ſide of the bed and JULIA upon the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, watching that breath that they expected every moment to leave the worn-out frame of their
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:039134_0057_1013AFFF8E329908"/>
expiring friend, and now and then wetting her parched lips with a liquid that the nurſe had prepared. The doctor declared that if ſhe ever awaked, ſhe would be in ſome meaſure recovered, or elſe in the laſt agony of expiring nature. The laſt hour of this ſleep appeared the longeſt of JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIA'S life; ſhe counted the ſeconds as they moved upon her watch, and liſtened for the clock to ſtrike twelve, with an impatience that ſhe had never known, as if the hour of midnight was to decide her fate, for it was the opinion of all, that the Counteſs would not ſurvive that time.</p>
               <p>But the clock had ſtruck twelve; and it was near one, when awakening with a deep ſigh, ſhe ſtretched out her feeble hand, and aſked for ſomething in ſuch a manner, as declared ſhe had regained her perfect recollection. JULIA had kept her ſorrow within due bounds, but ſhe could not ſo eaſily conquer or control her tranſports. She threw herſelf upon her knees; kiſſed the hand which ſhe held in hers, and in a delirium of joy, ſhe thanked heaven for this recovery; declared her ſelf the happieſt creature in the world, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the doctor with a thouſand expreſſions of frantic extacy. The ſenſible ſon of GALEN, found it neceſſary to curb her feelings. For the preſent, he perſuaded her to be more ſilent, and calm, which he aſſured her were highly neceſſary, as the Counteſs muſt ſtill be kept very quiet.</p>
               <p>She obeyed him, but though ſhe obſerved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a death like ſilence, ſhe could not ſubdue her joy; ſhe ſeemed to move on air; every care was lighter than down, and ſhe could with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty refrain from embracing every one who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached her.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="unknown:039134_0058_1013B0029104B080"/>
This night was a criſis that declared the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs a candidate for lengthened life: in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe was much better, and though her recovery was ſlow, it was attended with the moſt pleaſing preſages.</p>
               <p>The very day after her diſorder had aſſumed a favorable aſpect, the Marquis and his ſon arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; though the utmoſt caution was uſed in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming her they were come, yet ſhe was obliged to take ſometime to prepare her mind for an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, and ſent out the doctor to receive them. In leſs than half an hour ſhe became ſo compoſed, that they were introduced; ſhe held out her hand to her brother, ſaid ſhe was rejoiced to ſee him and thanked him for this viſit. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis who loved her tenderly, embraced her with emotion, and the Count expreſſed his ſatisfaction to find her out of danger. After they were ſeated, I cannot ſupport a converſation myſelf (ſaid ſhe very weakly) that taſk muſt devolve up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon my friend, Madamoiſelle VALLAICE, who does me the honor to reſide with me.—The Marquis now turned, and for the firſt time beheld the elegant form and intereſting face of JULIA; ſimple and unadorned, habited in a white <hi>Robe de Chambre,</hi> her beautiful hair ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over her fine forehead, and her charming mild eyes fixed upon the languid face of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs, animated with hope, and expreſſive of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme ſenſibility; ſhe returned the ſalutations of the Marquis with a graceful curtſy, and a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle inclination of her head; ſhe offered him her chair that he might ſet by his ſiſter, and the ſoft accents of her voice which tremblingly expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

               <p>It was many years ſince he had experienced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny emotion at the ſight of youth and beauty, but the beauty of JULIA was of that nature to arreſt the eye, to reach the heart, and to engage eſteem and reſpect from every beholder. The Marquis felt his whole ſoul drawn <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

She now aroſe to preſent the friends of her benefactreſs with a cordial; her motion ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid and eaſy, became again the ſubject of wonder. Where did you meet with this young lady, ſiſter? By an accident, the moſt fortunate to me, (ſhe replied.) JULIA added, the accident was indeed an happy one for her. The ſweetneſs of her voice again fixed his attention. Oh! CAMILLA, (ſaid he) ſuch was once the lovelieſt of women; ſay, did you never think ſhe reſembled—The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs (interrupted the Counteſs,) yes, brother from the moment I ſaw her, the likeneſs ſtruck me forcibly; but I ſee you are moved, I am ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry you have ſeen my JULIA; ſhe will abſent her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I am ſure, if the ſight of her, pains you.—Certainly (cryed JULIA.) I would not for worlds give a moment's pain; ſhe was going,—No, (ſaid the Marquis detaining her) your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence would indeed diſtreſs me, I am an old Man, Mademoiſelle, and you may permit an old Man to look upon you; for indeed I find a pleaſure

in it, that I am not accuſtomed to; I am both old and unfortunate, ſay, will you indulge me with your ſociety, for there is a charm in it, that I thought was loſt forever.</p>
               <p>Oh (ſaid JULIA with impaſſioned fervor) if I can indeed give pleaſure to the beloved and reſpected brother of my benefactreſs, even a momentary pleaſure, I ſhall indeed be happy; too happy, too much honored, and grow vain. Amiable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (ſaid the Marquis) where are your parents, tell me that I may congratulate them upon ſo great a bleſſing. Alas! ſhe replied, I have none, and except your excellent ſiſter, not one friend in Europe. Then you ſhall be my daughter, (he ſaid) I never had one, and will be a father to you, ſay will you own me for a father?</p>
               <p>Happy Oh moſt happy ſhall I be (replied the grateful girl, to call you by ſo reſpected, ſo endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a name, and on my knees, I thank you for this condeſcenſion. He embraced her with tears, and ſhe joined her tears with his; ſhe wondered at emotions ſo new, and ſo pleaſing, and when ſhe beheld his hair whitened by ſorrow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>During the firſt part of this converſation, the Count had regarded JULIA with looks very different from his father's; his eyes had wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over every charm, and confeſſed its power; and he thought her an object worth his attention; but when the Marchioneſs was mentioned, he had
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:039134_0061_1013B00ACB916148"/>
retired with ſome emotion to the window, till the Counteſs prayed her brother to introduce his ſon to his adopted daughter; you are an old Batch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eldor, Nephew (ſaid ſhe,) but you muſt guard your heart, and think of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>IN one week the Counteſs was ſo well as to leave her chamber, and in leſs than two to ride out, and aſſociate with her family as uſual. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning health brought with it cheerfulneſs, and all its pleaſing attendants. She was anxious to render the Villa agreeable to her brother and his ſon; for, though ſhe deteſted the character of the latter, ſhe wiſhed to try what effect ſhe could have upon his mind, when at a diſtance from his vicious aſſociates.</p>
               <p>The Marquis grew every day fonder of JULIA, and ſhe looked up to him every moment with increaſing reverence and affection. The more the Count became acquainted with JULIA, the more dangerous he found her; too lovely not to be admired; too conſtant to change, and too frank to diſſemble: But notwithſtanding his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion he formed of her fidelity, his vanity repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented himſelf as irreſiſtible, and he began to form hopes, and to think that a connection with her virtues, would reſtore him ſome of thoſe he had loſt; and ſecure to him the good will and favor of the Counteſs, which he had penetration enough to know he was not poſſeſſed of; with
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:039134_0063_1013B01153B00A00"/>
this thought he ſtrove to render himſelf agreeable to her, and aſſumed a merit that he was a ſtranger to; but while laviſh in the praiſe of virtue, tho' loud in his declamation againſt vice; ſhe ſaw through the veil; penetrated through the cloud he had wrapped himſelf in, and found he was an infidel. "For tho' his tongue dropped manna, and could make the worſe appear the better reaſon," yet ſhe looked and found that all was falſe and hollow; nor was he ſuch a novice in the human heart, as not to read hers, he was indeed an adept in deception himſelf, and underſtood the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of mankind as well, if not better, than peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in general; he ſaw that JULIA deſpiſed him, and he could not hide from himſelf that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſhe ſhould.</p>
               <p>He was indeed a very ſingular character, his mind was never formed for virtue, and early in life he diſcovered traits of a deſigning, artful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; his father was very young, and at that time abſent; he was flattered and careſſed by all who knew him; and at the age of fifteen, put under the care of one of the worſt of men, who knew how to render the vices, and weakneſſes of others ſubſervient, to his own intereſt. This man was a member, though a concealed one, of the <hi>Illuminati,</hi> and he ſaw what an advantage would accrue to the ſociety, by adding to their number the principal of ALVADA and DE LAU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NA's family, whoſe great eſtates would enrich them, and whoſe power would ſerve as a protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; with this view he indulged all his pupil's vicious propenſities; turned all religion into ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule, and learned him to conceal his vices with
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:039134_0064_1013B012D5CBF0D8"/>
art and caution. The young man was an apt ſcholar, and by the time he was twenty, had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſome crimes that made even his tutor ſhudder; he had indeed been ſucceſsful in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment, but ſome little piccadilla as they were called by his party, had eſcaped him, and ſealed his character with the ſtamp of infamy, in the opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of every perſon of worth and merit; nor could any pretentions to virtue ever reſtore it to any thing like purity. Dark in his deſigns; ſudden in his reſolves; obſtinately attached to his own opinions; vain of his underſtanding; and though in many reſpects ignorant; proud of his talents, and after all, though courageous in the proſecution of his deſigns, he had a latent weakneſs and imbecility of mind, or rather cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice of thought; for, it could not be called conſcience, that ſometimes made his aſſociates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to truſt him, though they ſcared to refuſe him their confidence, for he was envious and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious. Thus, though hated and deſpiſed, by them all, he was their ruler, held their lodges at one of his houſes, and was now next in dignity to their Grand Maſter; he hated royalty, yet was ſometimes ſo vain, as to aſpire at the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a ſceptre; he laughed at religion, and he trembled at its power and wiſhed, to poſſeſs it; he turned virtue into ridicule, while he had known it exiſted; and he adored honor, at the moment he ſneered at its dictates; as a ſlave to vice, he was unacquainted with reaſon, for its laws had never once controled one vicious thought, nor prevented one bad action. This was the Count DE LAUNA, a man who had not been one
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:039134_0065_1013B015801D1938"/>
fortnight at the Villa before he made ſerious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals to the innocent and amiable JULIA.</p>
               <p>Never was the power of virtue more fully proved over the vicious, than in the preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; not that virtue embodied, could have made a laſting impreſſion on a mind ſo vitiated as the Count DE LAUNA; but it had a tranſient effect, it arreſted him in his career, it ſtopped the progreſs for the preſent, and it occaſioned a lapſe in his illegal purſuits. He was never tired of the company of JULIA, and though her whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct was a cenſure upon his own, and he ſaw he was indebted for the little civility and reſpect ſhe granted him, to his father and aunt, though he feared ſhe hated him, yet he loved her as a being of ſuperior merit. When he came into her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, he loſt that haughty triumph that was ſo evident in his countenance and demeanior, and became humiliated to ſuch a degree, that he deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed himſelf for his ſervility which he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unable to conquer.</p>
               <p>The Marquis enjoyed in the quiet of the Villa, a ſatisfaction, to which he had been long a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; his health was benefitted; his mind was calm, and his reaſon, which had been much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranged, was perfectly reſtored; the Counteſs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved this change with pleaſure; ſhe loved her brother and did every thing in her power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long a viſit, that rendered her much the happier; his ſon was in his opinion reſtored to virtue, and JULIA whoſe whole attention was marked with a kind of reverential attention, performed for him a thouſand little offices, that more properly belonged to his domeſtics; when he entered the
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:039134_0066_1013B01706AD32B0"/>
room where ſhe was ſetting, ſhe aroſe involunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily; if his ſeat was inconvenient, or unpleaſant, ſhe was ſure to fix one more commodious; if he walked, ſhe attended him; if he ſlept, as he ſometime did in his chair or ſopha, ſhe played ſome ſoft tunes upon the harp or piana; if he wiſhed it, ſhe read to him, and in ſhort ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo neceſſary to his comfort, that he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy without her; thus ſhe cheated him of his ſorrows, and concealed her own; for ſhe was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy about COLWORT of whom ſhe had heard nothing ſince his embarkation for America.</p>
               <p>Thus paſſed three months, and the Count had exerted every talent to prevail with JULIA to accept his hand and fortune, but all his perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions proved that thoſe talents which had been ſo ſucceſsful with other women, were nothing to her, and he had the extreme mortification to find, he had not advanced one ſtep farther towards her favor, at the end of three months unwearied conſtancy, than when he began the attempt.</p>
               <p>More company now appeared at the Villa, theſe were Madamoiſelle GYRON and DONNA OLIVIA a Spaniſh lady; this laſt lady was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantly related to the Counteſs, and had taken this opportunity to play off her hitherto ſucceſsful charms upon the Count. Mademoiſelle GY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RON, had always felt the warmeſt eſteem and love for the Counteſs; ſhe was certainly a fine wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and though an air of penſive ſadneſs was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and though ſhe wiſhed to conceal it, it was always obſerved. She had heard with extreme ſatisfaction of her late recovery, and ſhe took this opportunity to renew their old friendſhip, and congratulate her upon her returning health.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="unknown:039134_0067_1013B01B1A271D38"/>
The Chevalier ENON, a coxcomb and an Ital<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian Nobleman, who was a kinſman of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs, attended theſe ladies, and they came prepared to render this party as pleaſurable as poſſible. DONNA OLIVIA, was a finiſhed Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quette; ſhe had beauty, and ſhe added to it an haughtineſs that was inſufferable to good minds; but which pleaſed men of a particular deſcription, but the mild and modeſt JULIA felt ſo humbled by it at firſt, that ſhe ſeemed to ſhrink from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and it was ſeveral days before ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered her uſual eaſe and gentle dignity. The Italian was an old beau, but his heart was honeſt and his ideas often truly diverting.</p>
               <p>The Counteſs introduced JULIA as her ward, and as ſhe knew the power of wealth over the human heart, ſhe intimated that her fortune was conſiderable, this was done merely to ſave her young friend the mortifications that any ſlight or neglect would occaſion. By the men ſhe was pronounced a divinity. Madamoiſelle was charmed with her, and as ſhe had a large ſhare of penetration, had ſtudied the mind of man, and knew the world; ſhe ſaw that ſome myſtery hung around her, and ſhe was determined, though not from a bad motive, to develop it if poſſible. But the praiſes that all concurred to give her, enſured her of DONNA OLIVIA's envy; ſhe looked upon her as a ſimple country girl, whoſe beauty ſhe was obliged to acknowledge, but was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intirely unacquainted with the <hi>beau monde,</hi> and treated her with that neglect that ſhe ſuppoſed the world would approve of, and that was moſt likely to pain her. But with all her ſimplicity
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:039134_0068_1013B01DD0DCC5C0"/>
the noble minded girl heeded not her neglects, and if ſhe felt it, her conduct was ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed her innate ſuperiority.</p>
               <p>For one week the Chevalier was in love, he dreſſed, danced, ſung and talked nonſenſe, but all to no purpoſe; JULIA was diverted with his follies, and he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ound the purſuit vain, and like a true Frenchman grew himſelf ſick of it.</p>
               <p>DONNA OLIVIA exerted all her talents to pleaſe the Count, and it is certain that he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be pleaſed, and paid her an attention at once flattering to her, and ſurprizing to his friends. The truth is, he was tired of his unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful attentions to JULIA, and eſtimating her by ſome that he had formerly known, he ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the fear of rivalry would alarm her jealouſy and wound her pride, and in the end ſerve his purpoſe better than the marked reſpect and deference he had hitherto paid her. With this view he actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made love to OLIVIA, who wiſhed for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much as to ſecure her conqueſt, and pleaſed with her lover, flattered herſelf that ſhe ſhould ſoon become Counteſs DE LAUNA; this idea was really ſuggeſted by an affection to the Count's perſon, independent of his rank and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence; but for one moment it did not exiſt in his boſom, he had never once thought of matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial fetters, unleſs JULIA, would put them on for him, ſince he ceaſed to teaze her with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions that were irkſome to hear, and which would have flattered the pride of moſt women, only gave her pain; ſhe behaved with her uſual eaſe and good humour, and was always calm and ſerene. The Counteſs was happy to ſee her
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:039134_0069_1013B020868A7040"/>
friends and the whole party were moſt agreeably entertained.</p>
               <p>One morning, after the ſubject of converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had ſhifted ſeveral times, according to the whim or fancy of the company, it turned upon men of honor and the common acceptation of the word.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>"HONOR's a ſacred tye, the Law of Kings;</hi>

                  </l>
               </q>
               <p>What can be more binding upon a man of nice honor, (ſaid the Count,) than his honor; what pledge to ſacred, what ſo ſolemn! Why nothing replied the Counteſs,) nothing, and yet I do not believe the Engliſh Moraliſt ever meant to have the ſentiment you have quoted, applied to our modern men of honor, a principle of rectitude and of religion, will render the word of a plain honeſt man, of ten times more conſequence than what you call a principle of honor. And yet cried OLIVIA, the mind muſt be mean and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious, that would not truſt the word of a man of honour, even if it had not all the good quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that you ſeem to think neceſſary. I think, (ſaid the Counteſs) that a man has no reaſonable pretentions to honor, who is deſtitute of thoſe requiſites; and I am ſure no word was ever more wrongly applied; no term more proſtituted, than that which is the ſubject of Converſation. Theſe men of honor as you call them, and as they call themſelves, will undoubtedly defend their reputation, at the riſque of their lives, even if that reputation, has been ſtained with every infamous, every vicious deed; they will pay their debts of honor, and cheat the honeſt tradeſman, who furniſhes them with the neceſſary articles of
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:039134_0070_1013B02336204ED8"/>
life; they will fight for their king, their country, or their honor; but I believe there are but few of them who would not ſeduce the wife or daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his friend, bring diſtreſs into his own family, blaſpheme his God, redicule religion, and trample upon all laws but thoſe of honor. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I think (continued ſhe,) that a man muſt act from higher principles, before he can be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a man of honor, he muſt be fearful to offend a God of purity, who ſees into his moſt ſecret thoughts, words and actions; he muſt in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the commands of that God, do to all men as he wiſhes to be done by; when this is the principle he proceeds upon, he will be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally a man of honor, ſuch a man may boaſt the noble diſtinguiſhing perfection with propriety, and ſuch a man is the American WASHINGTON, he has fought, bravely fought for his country, but I never heard of his fighting a duel: he has really protected the rights of man, and avenged the injuries of his fellow-citizens, but never brought ſorrow or ruin to the families of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen; in him, the wives, daughters and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of America find a friend and protector. Let no one henceforth claim the ſacred title of a man of honour, unleſs he can like him, "keep a conſcience void of offence towards God and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards man." But a modern man of honor is a more dangerous character, than a downright knave, who is known to be a villain, and ſcorns not to be called ſo; for the former acts in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, and in deceiving others, often deceives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; the world infatuated with the glare of his character, will admire, fear and truſt him: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:039134_0071_1013B025DF74EEC8"/>
there are ſome whoſe inclinations always ſide with the laws of honor and virtue, for we do find perſons who are poſſeſſed of ſo tranquil a temper, and have ſo happy a temperature of blood and ſpirits, that they are inclined to do right and virtuous actions, even without any fixed principle; but theſe perſons are in great danger of falling into temptation; their eaſe and imbecility of mind may betray them into evils, which require principle, and fixed ideas of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of ſhun; and in general I am perſuaded where a principle of religion does not prove a ſafeguard to honor, that however dazzling it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, when the inclinations, the intereſts, or wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es can be indulged at its expence, honor is found an inſufficient barrier, and flies as a phantom of the morning, or as the <hi>ignis fatuus</hi> of a vapory night, and leaves the deluded wretch plunged in vice and miſery.</p>
               <p>I know your aſſertion to be juſt (ſaid Madam GYRON,) and I will produce an inſtance that has fallen within my own obſervation. A man of the higheſt ſenſe of honor, who had fought to eſtabliſh it, who was admired and even eſteemed by all, became at one and twenty, when his ideas of honor or rather his character was at its Zenith, the guardian of a young lady juſt then fourteen, the daughter too of his beſt friend and protector: Her fortune was pretty conſiderable, her perſon rather pleaſing, her life had been innocent; her mind pure, and her heart unadulterated by art, or the world: But this man of honor within one year ſeduced her from the paths of virtue, deprived her of her honor, and rendered her a
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:039134_0072_1013B0288C3E5E70"/>
wretch indeed; he was then married, but when five years afterwards he left his wife; when he had ſtripped his unhappy ward of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and left her in a Convent almoſt in want of the neceſſaries of life, he then refuſed her the only reparation in his power, and left her ſtill to ſuffer: But when by the death of a diſtant rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhe became miſtreſs of an ample and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent property indeed; this man of honor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſought her out and would again have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived her, for he offered marriage: But ſhe nobly ſcorned him and ſought a great, a laſting revenge, a revenge that has planted his pillow with thorns, and till this moment he lives a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer in continual fear, that he ſhall be puniſhed for a crime of which he is not guilty; but ſtill by ſome he is conſidered as a man of honor; his ſtory is concealed, but how much better would a principle of religion and rectitude of heart have been, than this ideal, fantaſtic honor which he profeſſed; the one would have ſerved as a refuge in diſtreſs; would have ſhielded him from the commiſſion of guilt at which his ſoul ſhrinks with horror; would have left him peace of mind, if ſuſpected, and he would not ſhudder, as he now does, leſt the thunder burſt over his head, and the red lightning blaſt his guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
               <p>But (aſked the Count,) what was the nature of this revenge; it could not be too great, for he was indeed a villain. That is a ſecret, ſhe replied, but it was great and glorious. The Counteſs was about to make ſome remarks upon revenge, and its conſequences; but upon caſting her eyes
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:039134_0073_1013B02B3898DC70"/>
upon Madam GYRON'S face, ſhe beheld it unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually fluſhed, her eyes ſparkled with the fire of paſſion, and her whole frame appeared ſo ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itated, that ſhe dropped the converſation, and propoſed a walk.</p>

                     <p>The very day of my arrival, after a pleaſant paſſage, I was ſo fortunate, as to hear of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate couſin; poor girl, her wretched huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band it ſeems is no more, and now upon the banks of Kennebeck, almoſt upon the confines of the United States, ſhe has found a ſhelter, and but for ſome humane perſons there, ſhe muſt have ſuffered every evil of poverty and diſtreſs.

Within the laſt week, I have made my bow to many, and delivered my letters of recommendation, and in conſequence of them, been waited upon by many gentlemen, and entertained with a magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence that was to me quite unexpected; plain hoſpitality would have been much more pleaſing. I aſſure your ladyſhip, that this new world imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates the old, ſo well, that it would be difficult to ſay which is the original; the gentlemen have their clubs and gaming tables, and the ladies have, what in London, would be called routes, but in this town are termed mere tea parties; even cards are not mentioned, but they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly introduced, and met with every where; the ladies play as high as circumſtances will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and though the fatal mania, that has deſtroyed ſo many families, has not ariſen to that height here, that it has in Europe, I think the worſt conſequences may be expected, and I have never beheld a beautiful women ſeated at the card table without thanking heaven, that ſhe was neither my wife, or ſiſter, it has always appeared not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ridiculous, but mean, that our very amuſement ſhould become a matter of traffic, and that we cannot ſpend an evening without ſuffering diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordant paſſions to interrupt our ſerenity, with the hope of gain, or fear of loſs; it is indeed worſe than loſs of time, for it is vainly trifling with what is moſt precious—our temper and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; it is indeed ſpoiling both; for I have never met with a woman who had practiced gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one year, but evil paſſions had ſo coroded her heart, that they were imprinted upon her face, and gloom and diſappointment, overſpread that
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:039134_0077_1013B03643E7E0C0"/>
face upon which ſmiles and good humour uſed to appear in their moſt bewitching charms. How much more amiable, how much more feminine does woman appear, when converſation or books, or any other rational employment conſtituted there amuſement, or occupied there time, than when ſpending it in this ſhameful manner; and what dependence can be put upon a woman whoſe good humor depends upon the turning up of a card, or whoſe cheerfulneſs may be diſpelled by the caſting of a dice. But I will hope that here, as well as in Paris or London, there are many even of the firſt councils, who have never ſhuffled a pack of cards, or ſhook a dice box.</p>
                     <p>A few evenings ſince, I was ſo fortunate as to be introduced to two ladies who are famous in the literray world; Mrs. MORTON, the darling daughter of the muſes, who writes under the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature of Philenia, and Mrs. MURRAY, the refin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and the elegant Moraliſt, who has taken that of CONSTANTIA; theſe ladies are very different, and both very engaging; Mrs. MORTON is ſtill a very lovely woman, though ſhe is the mother of a conſiderable family, and has grown up daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: her Beacon-hill, an epic poem that I have read before I left Europe, is enough to place her in the firſt grade of poets, but I have ſince I come here, ſeen ſome little fugitive pieces that are ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and I think brighter effuſions of genius.</p>
                     <p>I have ſeldom met with a woman who conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes more ſenſibly or with more propriety upon every ſubject, than Mrs. MURRAY; ſhe has lately publiſhed the Gleaner, a periodical work, in three volumes, that does great honor both to

I have dined with this lady, and was charmed with my entertainment, and pleaſed to find that her literary purſuits did not interfere with her domeſtic virtues; ſhe is a moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent wife, and one of the beſt of mothers, and the perfect order and arrangement of her houſe-hold, declare her a complete houſe-wife; ſhe employs every hour uſefully, and her employments do not interfere with her converſation, which is always ſenſible, lively and inſtructive, and let the ſubject be what it will, ſhe always renders it intereſting. I have but ſeldom known any one ſo pleaſed with the praiſes of others, or ſo willing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend ſiſter excellence, and defend an injured and abſent perſon: I am much pleaſed with her poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and join many of her friends in wiſhing ſhe would conſent to give a few volumes to the public.</p>
                     <p>Your ladyſhip will perhaps wonder to hear me talking of good houſewifery and economy, for through I have the honor to addreſs the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs DE LAUNA, yet I have been brought up in a merchant's family, and my good aunt plumed herſelf upon her good management, and was real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

one of the moſt notable dames in the world: Beſides you have told me what a charming little dairy woman my JULIA was, when you firſt found the dear Cottager; and the perfect order that preſides at the Villa convince me that your Ladyſhip has not a contempt for what in an high ſtation may be conſidered only as a ſubaltern virtue; but in the middle ſtyle of life, as well as amongſt the induſtrious citizens and tradeſmen, ought to be held of the higheſt grade, and the want of it has brought miſery and ruin upon many a family; a ſteady purſuit of economy and attendance upon domeſtic affairs would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from diſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>I have been more than once delighted when buſineſs has obliged me to call upon a mechanic, to find at an early hour his wife up, his breakfaſt ready; his children clean, &amp; his humble habitation in order; ſmiles of unaffected cheerfulneſs have overſpread every face, and irradiated every coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and he has looked forward to increaſe of wealth and reſpectability, through the agreeable medium of induſtry in himſelf, and good manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his wife. I have more than once too left this pleaſing picture of domeſtic bliſs, and after an hour or two, called upon ſome of my more faſhionable acquaintance, I have there beheld juſt at twelve, or perhaps one, juſt riſen from her uneaſy ſlumbers, a woman who apeing high life, has ſpent her night at the virgils of the card ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and who has been ſacrificing her huſband's property, her own reputation and honor at the haunts of diſſipation, and upon the altar of folly: Gloom, chagrin and caprice, have been pictured
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:039134_0080_1013B03E643AD378"/>
upon every feature of her face, and her faſhionable diſhabille has been far leſs becoming, than the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Thus it is, my dear Madam, our father's toil hard to give us an education, we become gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and moſt readily ſpend what has been earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſweat of their brows, and ours ſons or grand-ſons at farthereſt muſt return to labor or all the ills of poverty: I am now, my dear Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſpeaking of thoſe in a middling rank of life, and my thoughts have not aſpired at nobility; indeed my acquaintance with thoſe have been limited, for though I have now and then met with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Laſt evening I went to the theatre for the firſt time, and acknowledge I went with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable prejudice upon my mind; uſed alone to the play houſes in London, I had no idea that I ſhould meet with a good houſe or good per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, the play was the production of one of our beſt Engliſh poets, and I was moſt agreeably ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed to find the ornaments and ſcenery, not only pretty and well fancied, but really elegant,
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:039134_0081_1013B04130829440"/>
and before the end of the firſt act, I became ſo much intereſted by the juſt as well as comic act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that my mind ſtrayed not from the ſtage for the evening: I was much pleaſed with both the male, as well as the female actors; and am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to think if due incouragement is given, that Mr. HODCKINSON, will become as famous both in comedy and tragedy, as GARRICK was in Great-Britain. Many things have been ſaid and written againſt theatrical amuſements in this town, and much oppoſition was made to the building of a theatre; I have heard the arguments upon both ſides, and confeſs I am inclined to think a well regulated play-houſe, and a well choſen, and well performed play, can never injure the morals or manners of a perſon of any worth, and of what conſequence are thoſe, who are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſpoiled? The human mind is ever in purſuit of ſomething; it requires amuſement to relax it after buſineſs, and thoſe who are too great, or too indolent to attend to buſineſs or improvement, will ſeek amuſement at the tavern or gaming ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if no better place preſents, and I am much miſtaken if either of them are more injurious to the minds, health and eſtate of our young men, than a theatre, and I have no doubt, but if one was not permitted, ſome more detrimental mode of ſpending time, would be invented and without its utility.</p>
                     <p>I am perſuaded your patience is quite exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this long letter, but I have followed your directions, and tried to prove whether your aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion was juſt, when you ſaid, it could never be tired of the letters of your friends.

               <p>THE Count had been a concerned ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of JULIA'S emotion, at receiving COLWORT'S letter, and though the omen that he drew from it was diſcouraging; he was determined to make one more attempt, to gain her affections in an honorable way, and if he ſucceeded, to be as much reformed, and for as long a time as poſſible; but if he failed, to preſs a project that his own dark boſom had long harbored.</p>
               <p>With this view, he followed her to a little ſummer-houſe, in the garden, after dinner; as ſoon as ſhe ſaw him, ſhe prepared to leave him, and purſue her walk; I intreat, Mademoiſelle, (ſaid he with ſome ſolemnity) that you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume your ſeat, and permit me the pleaſure of a few moments converſation with you; ſhe was ſilent, but ſat down; after a little heſitation he reſumed: It is now four months ſince I have known you, and in that time, do me the juſtice to believe, that my heart has not ceaſed to beat for you, nor for one moment has my mind been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed on any other ſubject: He was going on, but ſhe interrupted him, with, I am ſorry to hear
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:039134_0084_1013B0480CFCE7C8"/>
it, my Lord, I hoped indeed that your mind had regained its uſual occupations, and was employed, in a more uſeful manner; I beg your Lordſhip will not think me diſreſpectful, but I wiſh to be excuſed from ſaying any thing more, upon a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that has already waſted too many moments; nothing has happened to change my mind, and I aſſure you that it remains the ſame. "A few minutes (ſaid he,) is no great ſacrifice, even to an enemy, and ſurely, JULIA, you will not deny that to me, while I plead ſomething in my behalf that you have not yet attended to; I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind you of the eaſe and affluence that will be yours, if you conſent to make me happy; nor do I mention a ſplendid title; I know you are above ſuch paltry conſiderations; but I would wiſh you to reflect one moment, upon the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, they will moſt certainly confer; ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to any you could ever receive in a connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Chevalier COLWORT, if you ſhould ever meet him again, which I think very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; you have known this young adventurer but a ſhort time; he has but a ſmall fortune; you muſt leave the friends who love you, to whom you are attached; you muſt leave France, a charming country, where your cheerfulneſs will endear you, and make you reſpected, and reſide amongſt ſtrangers; upon that haughty, unſocial Iſland, you will be deſpiſed; as a foreigner, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly as a French woman; for a depend upon it, no friendſhip, no amity can long ſubſiſt between a native of Britain and France; the averſion is rooted, it cannot be eraſed; it will embitter your future days, and render you unhappy; tied down
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:039134_0085_1013B04C2298EB18"/>
to their cold and frigid rules, you will be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conſolations of love or friendſhip; for they are capable of neither; but if you conſent to give me your hand, you will live with the Counteſs who loves you; you will be adored as the miſtreſs of all around you, and the poſſeſſion of unbounded wealth will give you the power to ſuccour the afflicted, and to aſſiſt the needy. My former life, has not been what I could wiſh, for upon reflection, I have been guilty of follies that I grieve for; of imprudence, that I regret; but it is rather my misfortune, than my fault; for I am perſuaded. I never ſhould have erred as I have done, if I had, at an early period of my life met a JULIA: It is in your power to perfect a reformation; it is with you to ſave me not only from preſent ſorrow, but perhaps from future miſery; you will make my father happy by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting his ſon a penitent and reformed: Oh, JULIA, do not turn from me an averted face; do not be deaf to my intreaties, but ſmile upon me, and give me that dear hand, and ſay you will be mine.</p>
               <p>I am grieved, my Lord, (ſaid JULIA, as ſoon as he had ceaſed ſpeaking,) that you ſhould after four months acquaintance with me, entertain ſo poor, and ſuffer me to ſay ſo unjuſt an opinion of me, as to ſuppoſe me ſo unſtable, and ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent: I wiſh you happy, my Lord: I wiſh it for your own ſake, for that of your excellent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and for your much loved aunt: If you have been guilty of follies, I hope you will in future be more circumſpect; a conſciouſneſs of having done wrong generally precedes repentance, and
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:039134_0086_1013B04ECA39E798"/>
from my ſoul, I wiſh you happy; I wiſh you may find a woman much more capable of making you happy, and more capable to move in ſo high a ſphere, than the humble girl you now addreſs. I feel the force of what you have ſaid; am ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the honour you do me; but, my Lord, why will you wiſh to deprive me of the only qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that would entitle me to your eſteem? In becoming yours, my Lord, I muſt forfeit my vows, break through a ſacred and ſolemn engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; a voluntary engagement too, and thus loſe my own good opinion, and loſe with it all hopes of happineſs. No, my Lord, I am incapable of a conduct ſo vain, ſo trifling, and ſo frivolous: I refuſe the profound honor, my Lord, becauſe I am engaged to another, and becauſe wealth, and a title however adorned, however noble and exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, could not compenſate to me the loſs of my probity; the loſs of the man I ſincerely love and eſteem, and ſuffer me to ſay, the loſs of your Lordſhip's good opinion.</p>
               <p>She aroſe to leave him, but he threw himſelf between her and the door, with a countenance inflamed by anger, and a frame agitated by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting paſſion, he ſwore ſhe ſhould not leave him: think for a moment, (ſaid he,) before you ſeal your ruin, this is the laſt time I will ever put it in your power to reject or receive; I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready thrown away too much time upon you, but you ſhall be mine, be heaven, you ſhall.</p>
               <p>Never, my Lord, (ſhe replied,) I never will be yours, nor will I ſeal my ruin, by giving a conſent to what I ſhould deteſt myſelf; for, reflecting upon for a moment, with any degree of compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:039134_0087_1013B0518789FE20"/>
Never, cried he, enraged; the time will come, when with all the ardent fondneſs of your ſex, you will beg in vain for the honor you now reject; by heaven, he added, while fury flaſhed in his eyes, I am half a mind to murder you and myſelf; but the time will come, for revenge, when, and that ſhortly too, you will repent this madneſs; but penitence will then come too late, and ſelf reflections will render you doubly wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; you ſhall never ſee that curſed adventurer more, never ſee again that infatuating ſavage.</p>
               <p>I rejoice, my Lord, (replied ſhe, almoſt ſmiling from the complacency of the idea,) I rejoice that your power is not adequate to your will, and that my fate is in the hands of one, who can controul both you and I at pleaſure; who with one thought can bid this whirlwind of the paſſions ceaſe, who will never put it in the power of a vain mortal, to ſay what ſhall, or what ſhall not be done; there is no ſituation, my Lord, above his reach, nor no one ſo humble as to be below his condeſcending care and kindneſs; he has promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to protect the orphan, and as ſuch, my Lord, I will depend upon him: Let me go, ſaid ſhe, firmly, I inſiſt upon being detained no longer; I inſiſt upon paſſing, and ſhe paſſed him with a ſpirit that amazed him; leaving him aſtoniſhed at her fortitude, and his mind a prey to conflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſions.</p>
               <p>But the fortitude of JULIA forſook her; as ſoon as ſhe had left him, a kind of indignant deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration had ſupported her in his preſence, but ſhe hurried to her chamber, burſt into tears, and was giving full vent to her emotions, when ſhe
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:039134_0088_1013B054465EA938"/>
was interrupted by Madam GYRON, who had been in purſuit of her, and was ſurprized to find her in ſuch a ſituation: Dear Mademoiſelle, ſaid ſhe, what is the matter? JULIA could not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; what is the matter ſhe repeated, it is not a reprehenſible curioſity, for that I could ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, it is a better motive that makes me inquire into this extraordinary emotion, perhaps my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice may be of ſervice to you; do my dear JULIA, confide in me, and whatever may have cauſed your grief, it ſhall be a ſecret, if you wiſh it, and I am ſure you will never repent the confidence that I ſolicit.</p>
               <p>It was indeed a releaſe to JULIA to unfold to this friendly and ſenſible woman, the preſent cauſe of her ſorrows, and to receive with gratitude the advice ſhe offered her: Madam told her in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, that ſhe highly approved of her refuſal, and ſpirited behaviour: I know him to be a villain, (ſhe added,) I know ſuch things of him as make me ſhudder only to think of; but his threats are not to be deſpiſed, for he is powerful and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious: I would have you behave as uſual to him; he will, I fancy, ſoon leave the Villa, and then conſtraint will be no longer neceſſary; but do not inflame him to revenge, by informing his aunt, till his departure, and I believe we ſhall all be glad of his abſence. I fancy, ſaid JULIA, DONNA OLIVIA will not acquieſce in your ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but I ſuppoſe ſhe does not know him as he is. DONNA OLIVIA, my dear, has been uſed to affluence from her cradle, ſhe cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt without it; her family is ruined, her fortune ſpent, ſhe loves the Count, and ſuch are her ideas
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:039134_0089_1013B0571A31BFE0"/>
that ſhe would accompany him to the Altar, though he ſtood confeſſed the villain before her, and ſhe knew that his heart was engaged to you.</p>
               <p>Is it poſſible, (ſaid JULIA,) that any one can think or feel ſo? Why, I had rather labor for bread, and receive the ſcanty pittance of hard earned induſtry, than to be the wife of ſuch a man. And ſo had I, (replied Madam,) but my dear, we muſt go down; take no notice of what has paſſed, and I will contrive, in a day or two, to free you from ſuch a conſtraint, as the preſence of that wretch will inflict.</p>
               <p>They then joined the company, and had the ſatisfaction to find the Count was not with them: indeed he was too much diſcompoſed to aſſociate with any one, and with a confidential ſervant had rode out. This man had been long a faithful auxiliary, and he now diſcloſed to him, ſchemes of the blackeſt die; nor did the fellow miſs this opportunity to inform his maſter ſome hints that had dropped from a ſervant of Madam GYRON's, which the guilty conſcience of both the Count and the man immediately ſuggeſted, alluded to a tranſaction that had paſſed ſome years before, and fearful leſt any thing more ſhould be ſaid, he concluded to leave the Villa.</p>
               <p>In purſuance with this reſolution, he did not return untill the Counteſs and her gueſts had retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; he then waited upon the Marquis in his bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, and formed an excuſe that obliged him to depart immediately for Paris; the Marquis admitted his excuſe, and at his requeſt conſented to ſay every thing to the Counteſs and her friends that was neceſſary: He took leave of his father
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:039134_0090_10136EAE49797DC8"/>
that night, and before the riſing of the next ſun, was with all his attendants, half a league from the Villa.</p>
               <p>The company were ſurpriſed to find he had left them in that abrupt manner, but all readily admitted his excuſes, except DONNA OLIVIA, who could not conceal her chagrin, and diſappointment; but before night ſhe received a ſummons to viſit her brother who was very ill, and Madam, GYRON, who had come in the ſame carriage readily agreed to return with her, and the Chevalier ſignified his intentions of accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them the next day.</p>
               <p>The Counteſs unwilling to be ſo ſoon depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the ſociety of her friend, urged her longer ſtay, and the Marquis and JULIA added their moſt preſſing perſuaſions to her invitation, but ſhe pleaded ſome buſineſs that muſt be ſoon at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, and promiſed a longer viſit when the coming winter had excluded other viſitors.</p>
               <p>The Italian concluded to ſtay a few days lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at the Villa, and then return immediately to Spain, and not go again to Paris. The next day he remarked that JULIA, had a happy mixture of the French and Italian in her countenance: You have all the vivacity of the one, ſaid he, with all the bewitching ſoftneſs of the other; was your father a Frenchman, Mademoiſelle? Indeed I do not know, (ſhe replied,) while the crimſon that mantled upon her check, diſcovered that her mind had underwent a ſudden emotion. Not know, (he repeated, amazed at her anſwer;) not know of what country your father was? I never was ſo happy as to know a father, (ſhe
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:039134_0091_1013B05DACD8F8E8"/>
ſaid, while her voice trembled as ſhe ſpoke.) Was your mother an Italian? ſhe interrogated.) Of that I am likewiſe ignorant, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> I believe ſhe was a native of France. Perceiving that his queſtions embarraſſed her, he dropt them, and ſoon after ſought the Counteſs, who finding he knew ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of JULIA, told him part of her ſtory with a ſtrict injunction of ſecrecy. In a few days he left them, and the Counteſs, her brother, and JULIA, again enjoyed that ſocial intercourſe which conſtitutes the ſweeteſt happineſs of congenial ſouls.</p>

               <p>IN about four weeks they were ſurprized one afternoon by the arrival of a number of men at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by two officers, who entered the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in which the Counteſs and her friend were ſeated, without ceremony, and ſeized upon JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIA, as a priſoner of ſtate: It would be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to expreſs the ſurpriſe or diſtreſs of the Counteſs, and the trembling girl; they begged an explanation, and deſired to know for what ſhe was arreſted; what was the crime alledged againſt one ſo innocent and inoffenſive. I ſhould be ſorry to offend your ladyſhip, ſaid one of the officers, I only do my duty, nor do I know for what Mademoiſelle is arreſted; here is my war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant which you may read.</p>
               <p>The Counteſs read with aſtoniſhment, and found it was under the great ſeal, and that it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ſeize the perſon of JULIA VALLAICE, a reſident at the Villa of the Counteſs DE LAU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NA, and conduct her to the frontiers of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and then deliver her up to the Spaniſh Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, who was one of the preſent company. It was in vain for the Counteſs to expatiate with theſe men, or to oppoſe a power ſo ſuperior; the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:039134_0093_1013B0631563E420"/>
had rode out, and all that ſhe could do was to aſſure JULIA, that ſhe and her brother would moſt certainly her; that they would firſt attend at Court and obtain all the information neceſſary, and uſe all their power for her releaſe. It was in vain that ſhe perſuaded them to tarry till the return of the Marquis, and till her car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage could be got ready. All the indulgence that could be obtained was for JULIA to take a trunk of clothes, and that ANET ſhould go with her in a carriage, which they had brought for the purpoſe of carrying her. The Counteſs put a purſe into her hand at parting, and gave another to the officers, who promiſed ſhe ſhould have ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery care and attention paid her during her journey. She hung upon the neck of her generous benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, ſhe wept upon her boſom, while the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs half diſtracted, knew not what to do, or how to conduct herſelf. Truſt in your innocence, my dear, ſaid ſhe, truſt in him who is the father of orphans, and the friend of the afflicted. Oh, Madam, and muſt I leave you, muſt I indeed be dragged from you? We part, but for a ſhort time, ſaid the Counteſs, I will be with you in a few days; ſhe could add no more, for the officers ſeparated them, and put the trembling JULIA into a carriage that waited.</p>
               <p>This tranſaction was ſo ſudden, and ſo unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; the tranſition from liberty and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to ſlavery and miſery; from all the bleſſings of friendſhip, and the moſt elegant and refined ſociety, to the company of men whoſe perſons were unpleaſing; whoſe manners were rough and diſagreeable; had taken place in ſo ſhort a time,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:039134_0094_1013B064AD35B718"/>
that when JULIA found herſelf ſhut up in a cloſe carriage with the officers, and ANET, ſhe could hardly ſuppoſe herſelf awake; ſhe thought it muſt be a dream, and ſhe tried to ſhake off the fetters of ſleep, that ſhe might eſcape from ſo dreadful a viſion. But her efforts were vain, ſhe found indeed it was a reality, a painful reality; and inſtead of the ſoothing, the ſentimental friend, the charming Counteſs, ſhe was driving from her, in company, that ſhe almoſt feared to look upon.</p>
               <p>She endeavored to recollect every paſſage of her life, to look back upon her infant hours, to form ſome probable conjecture, if poſſible, for what crime ſhe was now a priſoner, but it was in vain; ſhe only ranſacked the annals of an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent heart, of a life void of offence. She then ſearched the records of her memory for an enemy, and here indeed ſhe was more ſucceſsful, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection in a moment preſented the Count, he had threatened her with vengeance, and now in idea her accuſer, her judge, and her jailor, ſtood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, the Count DE LAUNA. She ſaddened at the horrid thought, and the hints and caution of Madam GYRON, ruſhed upon her mind, and brought ſuch a confuſion of afflicting images and ſuſpicio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, that ſhe almoſt ſunk under them.</p>
               <p>From this ſtate ſhe was recalled by the tears of ANET, who ſat crying oppoſite to her, and who had for a few minutes been forgotten: ſhe now endeavored to comfort the little girl, by an aſſurance that the Counteſs would ſoon follow, and that whatever happened to herſelf, ſhe would be taken care of; the voice of JULIA, who ſtiffled her own uneaſineſs, and appeared as calm
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:039134_0095_1013B0662F7B0780"/>
as poſſible, operated like a charm upon her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate attendant, and reſtored her to tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity: She aſſured her lady that ſhe would gladly go with her all over the world, and that ſhe was only diſtreſſed for the Counteſs, and her, and would be quite eaſy as to what concerned herſelf.</p>
               <p>JULIA now began to queſtion the officers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the cauſe of her arreſt; the Frenchman could not, and the Spaniard would not give her any information, and after a few fruitleſs enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, they all continued ſilent, and the mind of JULIA, wandered back to the Villa, which was now for behind her; ſhe ſaw, in imagination, the anxiety and diſtreſs of the Marquis, and his ſiſter, and almoſt fancied ſhe heard their voices, as they talked of her; ſhe ſometimes too, thought of COLWORT, and a ſigh followed. Her uncertainty was an aggravation to the anguiſh of her heart, and ſhe wiſhed this ſtate of ſuſpence over, let the end be ever ſo dreadful; for ſhe thought a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the worſt, could not exceed her preſent affliction. In conſideration of her attendant, ſhe concealed her fears and combated with forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude the agonizing ſurmiſes that ſhe could not diſmiſs: I every picture that her fancy drew, the Count ſtood foremoſt, and there was no evil that ſhe dreaded, that could bear any compariſon to thoſe ſhe feared from him, and her heart ſunk at the idea of meeting him.</p>
               <p>It is not our intention to deſcribe her journey, nor the towns and villages ſhe paſſed through; they only ſtopped to change horſes, and for refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and travelled with ſuch expedition, as left JULIA, no hope of being overtaken by her friends,
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:039134_0096_1013B16456EDFEC0"/>
until they reached the place of their deſtination. Upon the frontiers of the kingdom, the French officer left them, and JULIA had reaſon to regret his departure: The Frenchman was humane and civil, he had told her the names of the towns they had paſſed, and given her ſome ſketches of the inhabitants, and ſhe had endeavored to diveſt herſelf of perſonal fears, enough to attend; in ſome meaſure ſhe had ſucceeded, and ſhe found his communications a ſource of ſatisfaction: But the Spaniſh officer, who now took her into his cuſtody, was haughty and vain, ſupercilious and illnatured; and had beſides a really weak underſtanding.</p>
               <p>With this man ſhe continued ſome days lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; had her conſtitution been leſs firm, ſhe muſt have ſunk under the fatigue of ſuch a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, with a perſon and mind ſo harraſſed by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant fatigue and agitation: But a kind of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration kept her up, and her fortitude ſeemed to increaſe with her trials, and ſhe found the reſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhe had within herſelf, more numerous, than ſhe ſuppoſed them.</p>
               <p>At the cloſe of the fifth day, they arrived at M—, and JULIA was told her journey was terminated here: But when the coach ſtopped before a large high houſe, dark looking and ill contrived, ſhe trembled ſo, ſhe could hardly alight, and her tottering limbs would ſcarce ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port her, for ſhe there expected to meet the Count; but here ſhe was miſtaken, for ſhe was only met by too bad looking men, and an appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently innocent woman, who conducted her up two pair of ſtairs into a large Chamber, with a
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:039134_0097_1013B06A379821C8"/>
ſmall grated window, little furniture, and a bad fire; the weather was now cold, and ſhe felt the want of that cheering element; and when ſhe found herſelf only with ANET, and heard the door ſhut and the key turned upon her, her heart died within her, and overcome with fatigue and cold, ſhe found herſelf incapable of taking off her outſide garment, and ſunk into a chair, and for a moment become inſenſible either to the miſeries of retroſpection or anticipation.</p>
               <p>The cries of ANET, ſoon brought up the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who exerted herſelf for the relief of JULIA, and her recovered reaſon was ſoftened by ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, which by a guſh of tears, in ſome meaſure, relieved her almoſt burſting heart: She accepted the repaſt that the woman had provided and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming in ſome meaſure calm; ſhe ſuffered the bed to be warmed, and went immediately to it, after inſiſting upon her little attendant being a partaker of it. This was the firſt time ſhe had been undreſſed ſince ſhe had left the Villa, for the purpoſe of repoſe, and it now ſeemed to fly from her intreaties, and ſhe wooed it with wiſhes that ſeemed to drive it far from her; but towards day ſhe ſunk into a profound ſlumber, and did not awake, till the woman, ſhe had ſeen the night before, came to inform her that two perſons wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in an adjourning apartment to ſee her.</p>
               <p>She aroſe to dreſs herſelf with ſuch a confuſion of thought, and hurry of ſpirit, that ſhe could hardly put on her clothes; her face was pale and languid, a faint blush juſt tinged her cheeks; her hair which had not been dreſſed for many days fell in a kind of natural curl about her neck and
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:039134_0098_1013B06BC5786400"/>
forehead, and though her eyes had not loſt their brilliancy, they were more ſoft and gentle than uſual; yet the mild and reſolute fortitude of her mind was impreſſed upon her countenance, and ſhe prepared to accompany her attendant with dignity, tempered with ſweetneſs.</p>
               <p>She was only led to an oppoſite chamber, where ſhe found two perſons, one a young man of a pleaſing but troubled aſpect, and the other an old one, who wore an appearance of diſcontent and ſuſpicion: They both met her at the door, and ſeemed equally ſurpriſed at the elegance of her perſon, and manners; the glow upon her cheek was hightened to crimſon, by a ſenſation of ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led fear and indignation of conſcious virtue and aſſured innocence; with an air of reſpect they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted her to be ſeated, and aſſured her that no injury was intended her, and that if ſhe was not intirely ſatisfied with her apartment, ſhe ſhould immediately be put into poſſeſſion of a better: She replied that ſhe did not complain of her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, ſhe only wiſhed to be informed upon what pretext ſhe had been torn from her friends, and treated and confined as a priſoner. They replied, ſhe would ſoon be informed of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery circumſtance, and that reparation ſhould be made for every appearance of injury ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; they then converſed upon different ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and dropped no hint of what related to her confinement and ſituation; ſhe endeavored to join in the converſation which was ſeveral times addreſſed to her.</p>
               <p>In near an hour after, three men entered, one of them produced the materials for writing, and
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:039134_0099_1013B06FD6917B28"/>
the others began to interrogate her concerning her former life. They explained to her the nature of an oath, and then with great ſolemnity adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered it to her, when ſhe laid her hand upon the book, which ſhe obſerved to be the Bible, ſhe trembled, but ſhe lifted her heart up to heaven for ſupport, and went through the awful ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny without heſitation. They aſked her where ſhe was from? She anſwered that ſhe did not know. Where ſhe had lived? At Avignon, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til about ſix months ago, ſince which, with the Counteſs DE LAUNA. Who were her parents? Her father ſhe had never known; her mother, ſhe deſcribed with the circumſtance of her loſs. She anſwered all theſe queſtions with clearneſs, and without any apparent reluctance, and was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with reſpect, conducted back to her apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the door once more locked upon her.</p>

She got the keeper of the priſon to procure her the implements for drawing, and ſome books; the firſt he got agreeable to her direction; but he had no taſte, and was ignorant and ſuperſtitious, and he brought her ſome devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional tracts, and ſhe threw them by, for neither inſtruction nor amuſement could be gathered from them.</p>
               <p>She had ſome turn for drawing, but what could ſhe exerciſe that talent upon; her high grated window only gave her the proſpect of a dark nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſtreet, with a large brick building, the back of which was towards her, and which ſeemed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to prevent the rays of light or wholeſome air, from entering her gloomy apartment, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſufficiently excluded them, for ſhe had not ſeen the ſun, ſince her reſidence in it.</p>
               <p>She indeed ſketched the figure of ſome haughty Spaniards as they walked by in ſolemn ſtate, wrapped up in their black cloaks; but the ſameneſs, ſoon tired her, and ſhe could not row as formerly, draw from imagination; her heart was chearleſs, and her mind too gloomy, and ſhe choſe not to tinge the canvas with thoſe ſombre ſhades, and ſhe threw by the pencil;
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:039134_0102_1013B07838973E60"/>
her mind was inventive, ſhe aſked the woman that attended her, for work; plain uſeful ſewing ſhe preferred, and ſhe was ſoon furniſhed, and in this found a reſource againſt her ſorrows, and a ſolace in her affliction. She inſtructed ANET to work, and the jailor's wife began to find a benefit from their induſtry.</p>
               <p>While her fingers were ſo uſefully employed, her mind was at liberty to range at pleaſure, and in imagination ſhe often viſited the Villa; often felt the embraces of the Counteſs, and her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; often too, fancy repreſented them as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her relief, and ſhe accompanied them in their journey, found them ſtopped at the door of her priſon, liſtened to every noiſe or ring of the bell, and almoſt expected to ſee them enter her apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Some times too, ſhe croſſed the Altantic, and beheld her beloved COLWORT enjoying all the pleaſures of liberty and peace, improving his mind by obſervation, or occupied in ſoothing the broken ſpirit of his couſin, and cheriſhing her infant with tenderneſs and benevolence.</p>
               <p>Her mind had never known ſuſpicion, and ſhe was ſaved a vaſt deal of uneaſineſs, that mean diſpoſitions are ſubjected to; ſhe had never for one moment doubted, the continued affection and friendſhip of the Counteſs, or her brother, and a ſhadow of jealouſy had not for one inſtant cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her dependance, upon the conſtancy of COL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WORT. She ſometimes gave way to fear; that ſickneſs prevented her friends from coming to her relief; and then, indeed, ſhe was wretched.</p>
               <p>In leſs then a week, ſhe received another viſit from the gentlemen who had waited upon her
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:039134_0103_1013B079C384F488"/>
at firſt, underwent the ſame interrogatories, and returned the ſame anſwers; and was again recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to her priſon. Six days paſſed on as uſual, and her patience became almoſt exhauſted; and when led again to the preſence of the perſons, who had twice before queſtioned her, ſhe begged to know how long ſhe was to ſuffer this confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and what was alledged againſt her? I wiſh, Madam, I could anſwer you, ſaid the eldeſt, but I cannot. And why not, cried JULIA, with ſome ſpirit, I am unuſed to aſk favors, but in this caſe ſurely, it is natural, and excuſable; I only beg to be informed, why I am thus confined? I have been torn from friends that I love, from a ſituation that was delightful, from ſociety that was deareſt to my heart, and hurried along for ſeveral hundred miles, and after that, confined in a dark and gloomy priſon, without friends, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſociety, and without amuſement; not one intimation is given why I thus ſuffer? To ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, I am reſigned, and will be ſatisfied with the decrees of thoſe who have my fate at their diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal; all I aſk, is an end to this ſtate of ſuſpence, and I think I have a right to demand an anſwer, and a relief to the painful ſenſations that doubt occaſions. Three weeks from this, Madamoiſelle, (returned her interrogator,) the Lord High Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, with the other Judges, will return to this city, the court will then ſet, and a final decree will be given. Good God, ſaid JULIA, am I to be arraigned before the Lord High Advocate, and tried as a criminal, as a ſtate offender; what have I ever done to merit this treatment? You are not to be treated with ſuch ignominy, replied
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:039134_0104_1013B07EC18C5CC0"/>
the youth, nor are you to be brought as a criminal before any tribunal, and no one who looks upon you for a moment, would credit an aſſertion ſo improbable.</p>
               <p>I did not wiſh for a compliment, ſhe anſwered, I only wiſh for information. And that, he ſaid, is the only requeſt that cannot be granted; we are bound by the moſt ſolemn oaths, not to declare for what you are confined; if we break thoſe oaths, we are perjured. If that is the caſe, ſaid JULIA, ſighing, I muſt aim at reſignation; pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience is a virtue often called into exerciſe, and long and frequent uſe only, increaſes it; when our virtues lay dormant, and inactive, we do not juſtly appreciate them; it is practice that ſhews how really valuable they are, and how great their utility is. Indeed, ſaid the young gentlemen, we are grieved for you, and wiſh for nothing more, than to have the power to relieve your mind from ſuſpence, and your perſon from confinement. It is evident that you can practice every virtue; you are too lovely and amiable, to permit us to doubt it. Were I happy, ſighed JULIA, ſeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior, perhaps your compliments might make me vain; I am at preſent too much the reverſe to be elated. He bowed, and ſhe was again led back to her chamber, with a heart doubly oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; ſhe thought ſhe ſaw in the countenance of the young man, pity for her fate, while the old one ſeemed to betray ill nature, and ſquint ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. What they had ſaid reſpecting a court and a final decree, created a thouſand new images of horror; her mind recurred to the direction ſhe had received from her mother, not to leave the
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:039134_0105_1013B080447F7D40"/>
Cottage; again PIERRE, the ſon of the old man, had ſaid, her life when an infant, depended upon the concealment of her real name; that ſhe thought was now diſcovered, and her life would than be ſacrificed to ſome intereſted enemy. She had often wiſhed, ſhe could remove the veil, that wrapped her birth in impenetrable obſcurity; that veil ſhe now ſuppoſed would be ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and her death cloſe the ſcene; even to that ſhe looked with ſome degree of impatience; ſo greatly did ſuſpence aggravate every evil ſhe ſuffered: In the affection of the Marquis and his ſiſter, ſhe was ſecure, and ſhe had expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they would have come, or ſent to her ſuccour: She ſtill hoped they would appear; but, the ſad idea occurred, that perhaps, they were withheld from giving her any aſſiſtance, by that hand of power, that had confined her: perhaps too, they had upon inquiries found her ſtate ſo hopeleſs and deſperate, that every attempt was laid aſide, as fruitleſs and unavailing. In theſe reflections ſhe indulged, until her mind became a perfect chaos, and ſo much agitated, as to be little ſhort of diſtraction. She traverſed her apartment with hurried ſteps, till after ten, when ſhe heard a low ſtep approach her door, the key was turned with evident caution, and ſhe beheld the young man enter, whom ſhe had ſeen in the morning.</p>
               <p>He was alone, and approached her with evident confuſion and reſpect. Forgive this intruſion, ſaid he, forgive this unſeaſonable viſit, which is meant, if poſſible, to relieve you from ſome of the diſagreeable things that ſurround you. Your meaning is ſo very kind, replied JULIA, that I
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:039134_0106_1013B08319ED4C70"/>
am willing to overlook the impropriety. Have you any good news for me? Have my friends ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived? Is ſuſpence and concealment no longer neceſſary? I have heard nothing new, Madam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oiſelle, I do not even know your friends, and I am bound by a ſolemn oath not to reveal the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of your confinement. But the knowledge of it will injure no one, but myſelf; and free you from ſuſpence, and I could not reſt till I had relieved you, even at the expence of my honor. And do you think, ſaid JULIA, that I would buy tranſient eaſe, to myſelf, at ſuch a price? No ſir, if my curioſity is not to be gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, except at the expence of your truth, I will ſacrifice that curioſity, great as it is, and endure this ſuſpence, until I may with honor be relieved from it. There was a heroiſm in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that exerted a ſpirit that aroſe almoſt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm; it taught her the value of virtue, and learned her how much eaſier it was to endure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merited ſufferings, than pleaſure purchaſed at the expence of truth, even of another; the firſt ſhe had borne for weeks; her health was good, her nerves ſtrong, her capacities for reflection or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, for buſineſs or amuſement, by no means impaired; her appetite as good as it could be without exerciſe; but, at the idea of the laſt her heart ſickened, her limbs trembled, ſhe became pale, and ſhe would not have involved a fellow creature in guilt, for a world and liberty.</p>
               <p>The young gentleman gazed upon her with aſtoniſhment; he had that morning ſeen her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs; he obſerved, ſhe had pleaded with an energy of language; with an air of affliction, and
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:039134_0107_10136EB542B3F888"/>
had almoſt melted the heart of his companion, and now when her ſorrow was heightened by their refuſal, when anxiety and agitation was impreſſed upon every intereſting feature, ſhe could nobly refuſe to have her heart eaſed, her curioſity gratified, and her favorite requeſt granted, rather than ſuffer a ſtranger to forfeit his word, or to loſe his honor. This was a ſtretch of virtue, a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble height, to which CARLOS had never ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any mortal could aſpire to.</p>
               <p>I am charmed with your character, Madam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oiſelle, ſaid he, and hope that you will not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain too low an opinion of me; your beauty and your ſufferings led me aſtray; your fortitude and honor have reſtored my ſcattered reaſon, and I hope I ſhall be able to follow ſo noble an example. I thank you, ſaid JULIA, for your conſideration; to know that any one ſympathizes with me, is a relief to my ſorrows; and I ſhall always be grateful for the favor you intended me, for I ſhall always remember what a price you would have paid. He heſitated a moment, he looked upon her face, and the virtue that had until then reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his heart, was not proof againſt her ſoft and gentle beauty; he would have bartered it, to have made her happy, for it was death to ſee her miſerable. It is in my power, Madamoiſelle, ſaid he, it is in my power to free you from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, but ſhall I do it, or not? you yourſelf ſhall determine; upon your deciſion my fate now hangs; I will this night prepare a carriage, and ſet out with you for your friends; but he added with a ſigh, it is highly probable this may coſt a dear and reſpected father, his life; yet it
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:039134_0108_1013B085C7F4B288"/>
is a riſque, I am willing to run; a ſacrifice, I am willing to make; a proof that I am this moment ready to give. Heaven forbid it, ſaid JULIA, I would rather ſuffer impriſonment for life, with innocence, than by ſuch a ſtep incur the deſerved puniſhment of a guilty conſcience; no ſeignior, I am at length content to await the decrees of fate and its appointed time, for my death or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relief, but I will not involve you in my diſtreſſes, and I adviſe you, ſeignior, to appreciate virtue at too high a rate, than ever, even, for a moment of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to part with her; do not ſuffer either your ſympathy or benevolence to betray you, to loſe your honor or fortitude; they then become weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and are no longer virtues. I entered your priſon, he replied, with ſenſations very different from thoſe I ſhall feel at leaving it, I then pitied you as unfortunate; I now envy you as one of the firſt and nobleſt of characters; but amidſt the glare of your virtues, I muſt ſtill do homage to your beauties, I muſt, Madamoiſelle, I muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote my life, myſelf and fortune to you; Oh ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me to hope, that when this gloomy ſcene has paſſed, when this eventful period has elapſed, that one thing may be remembered with pleaſure; Oh promiſe when that time comes, to liſten to my vows, and to unite your fate with mine. I ſhould indeed be guilty, ſhe returned, of what I have always conſidered as unpardonable, if I heſitated to aſſure you, that though you will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways poſſeſs my gratitude and eſteem; that all my more affectionate thoughts, have long been in poſſeſſion of another; let this be ſufficient, and drop the only ſubject that I cannot liſten to with
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:039134_0109_1013B0899D090778"/>
pleaſure. I will obey you, ſaid he, though no one can tell with what anguiſh of heart I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh an hope, and the only one, that I had permitted to irradiate my proſpect; that proſpect is alas, more dark, more gloomy than ever, for ſhould the events of an approaching trial be as I apprehend, I ſhall leave my country, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence the life of a wretched wanderer, for how could I ſupport life and reaſon in a country dyed with the blood of a parent. Since I have ſeen you, I have indeed encouraged an hope, that matters might not turn out ſo badly, but be they what they will, I now find I have bid adieu to that tranquility that can make any place dear to me. Do not, interrupted JULIA, let ſuch melancholy fears tinge your mind; things may all be well, and it is a folly to anticipate evils that may never ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive, and wiſdom to be deluded by hope; you are ſtill very young; I don't know what ſcenes of ſorrow you allude to, but there are but few ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, but may be effaced, and the tranſient im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, that perhaps gives you pain at preſent, may and will ſoon be forgotten. I fear not, Madamoiſelle, he replied; indeed I do not wiſh it, for if I am to gain tranquility only by loſing ſome of the moſt delightful ſenſations; I own I have not fortitude to relinquiſh them. No greater proof can be given, cried JULIA, of the futility and folly of ſuch ſenſations, than not wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to part with them, when they are only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of pain, and cannot be indulged with honor; for my part, my proſpects are enveloped in ten fold miſery, and every ſtep I take, renders them darker and more perplexing; the abſolute
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:039134_0110_1013B08B1F75E8C8"/>
uncertainty I am in, at preſent, forbids my antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating; but I own that hope, even now throws a ray of light upon them. I wiſh it could be extended to you, and I think if you catch on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one gleam of ſo delightful a ſoother, you ought to encourage it. You are, indeed, he ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a delightful ſoother, but it is dangerous to be with you. I ought before this, ſaid JULIA, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting him, to have put an end to this viſit, and I thank you for ſo timely an intimation, and aſſure you that the pleaſure of ſocial and friendly converſation, has ſo relieved my mind, that I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got I was acting with impropriety. Do not wreſt what I ſaid, he cried, to ſuch a meaning, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a longer ſtay; for the moment, I quit you, I become a prey to gloomy doubts, and dark de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair. Indeed, ſaid the gentle girl, were I to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low only my inclination, your requeſt would be granted; but, it is time for you to go, and I muſt inſiſt upon it: She looked upon her watch, it was near twelve, you will carry my beſt wiſhes for your happineſs and tranquility. Good night, he ſaid, as he opened the door; you have taught me what it is to be virtuous, and to be miſerable. Virtue and miſery cannot long dwell together, ſhe obſerved, as ſhe bade him good night. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated the wiſh; the door was now lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the courſe of three weeks ſhe underwent ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral examinations, which all terminated as thoſe already narrated, at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

that in three days ſhe would appear before the Judges, and the old gentleman aſked her, with much civility, if ſhe did not want any thing to prepare her for this appearance. She anſwered him, that ſhe had or could procure, every thing ſhe wiſhed for, but her liberty; that with reſpect to her appearance, it was indeed, but of little conſequence, in compariſon to the event of that day, which, though dreaded, ſhe ardently wiſhed for.</p>

               <p>IT is now time to return to the Villa de Launa. When the Marquis returned from his ride, he was met by the ſervants who informed him of the departure of JULIA, and in a very incoherent manner, gave him a detail of that event, ſtupified by his information, it was with difficulty he reached his ſiſter's apartment, who could only confirm what he had already heard. Though as much ſhocked and diſtreſſed as the Counteſs, he endeavored to ſooth her by every argument that he could make uſe of, and aſſurances that every thing ſhould be done, to releaſe and reſtore her to them.</p>
               <p>Early the next morning they ſet off for Paris, and as ſoon as they arrived at that city, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis applied to the king; LOUIS received him with condeſcenſion and affability, the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Monarch, who has ſince drank the cup of affliction to the very dregs, had juſt began to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience the ſorrows that ſhowered ſo thick about him; his heart was open to the woes of others, and he wiſhed for nothing more than to ſee his people happy; but he could give the Marquis little information, and referred him to the Spaniſh ambaſſador; upon waiting at his
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:039134_0113_1013B095AE31DDE0"/>
Hotel, he was told, he was gone to paſs a week with a friend in the country. The next morning he appointed to follow him, but the exerciſes of his mind and perſonal fatigue, had brought on a fit of the gout, which fell immediately on his ſtomach, and confined him to his bed. The Counteſs, who loved her brother, and ſhuddered at th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> idea of his death, could not leave him for a moment; but though her anxiety for JULIA, was in ſome meaſure ſuſpended by this new af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, yet ſhe was not for one moment forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. Six days after his firſt attack, ſhe received a viſit from Madam GYRON, who had but juſt heard of her being at Paris. As ſoon as the Counteſs informed her of the cauſe of her jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and of her ſuſpence and uneaſineſs for JULIA, that lady with all the warmth of true friendſhip, offered to go herſelf to the Spaniſh Ambaſſador's, and learn the cauſe of JULIA's arreſt; ſhe ſaid he was a relation of her's, and would, ſhe knew, deny her nothing.</p>
               <p>She ſet off that very day for the country, and when arrived, heard ſome things of real import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to herſelf. Confuſed and agitated, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Paris, wrote an unſatiſfactory note to the Counteſs who was ſtill confined to her brother's bed-ſide; was preſent at the nuptials of a young lady ſhe had educated, and a young man ſhe had adopted as her ſon; got the depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſome perſons of reſpectability; and then, with the new married pair, ſet out for Spain, bearing letters from the Counteſs, accounting for the non-fulfillment of her promiſe, and fully fraught with love and tenderneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="unknown:039134_0114_1013B09730D99998"/>
We now return to JULIA, who the evening preceding her appearance at Court, found her mind much agitated beyond its uſual habit; ſhe could not ſleep, and aroſe early the next morning, that ſhe might be ready when called for; ſhe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired herſelf in a ſimple white robe, a ſmall cap, placed after the manner of the country, upon the top of her head, was her only borrowed orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But her ſoft and luxuriant hair, of the brighteſt auburn, curled in a thouſand natural but becoming ringlets, would have ornamented a face leſs beautiful than her own, which did not need the aids, which leſs handſome females find ſo neceſſary.</p>
               <p>At nine o'clock, ſhe was ſummoned to attend, and with a palpitating heart, obeyed the ſummons. The Court had not long been ſeated, the council upon both ſides convened; the concourſe was great; when attended by a thouſand graces, with an air at once humble and majeſtic, JULIA made her appearance; inſtantly the eyes of all were fixed upon her, and a murmur of applauſe ran through the building: She was led in by the jailer, and ANET was by her ſide; her appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance operated like a charm; even the Judges viewed her with partiality, and the Council, for the defendant, hoped every thing, from an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance ſo prepoſſeſſing. It is now time to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe the cauſe of her arreſt, and her myſterious confinement.</p>
               <p>Seignior DON PEDRO, a Spaniſh gentleman, had died of grief, for the loſs of an amiable wife; he had left an only child, a daughter, to the care of his brother, DON GASPERD, and by his will,
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:039134_0115_1013B098B2CD7670"/>
bequeathed his whole eſtate to that brother, if his infant daughter ſhould die before ſhe attained the age of one and twenty; but if ſhe lived until then, her fortune was to be at her own diſpoſal. The child was brought home to her uncle's houſe, but being ſeized with indiſpoſition, was carried into the country, with her nurſe, about ſix months after the death of her father; from that time ſhe had never been ſeen, and when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries were made for her, anſwer was given, that ſhe was in a Convent for her education; doubts had ariſen in the minds of many; the uncle had been unhappy and gloomy; but about three months previous to the arreſt of JULIA, the brother of the child's mother had returned from the Eaſt-Indies, and immediately demanded his Niece; DON GASPERD at firſt equivocated, then ſaid ſhe was dead, but being unable to prove this, declared ſhe had been ſtolen by her nurſe, as he ſuppoſed, for the ſake of ſome valuable trinkets, which ſhe had about her; that he had uſed every expedient, tho' ſecretly, to diſcover her; he could never find her. The newly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned uncle, who had loved his ſiſter with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme tenderneſs, immediately ſuppoſed that her life had been ſacrificed to ſecure her fortune, and directly commenced a proſecution againſt him, as the murderer of his ſiſter's child; this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened juſt before the Italian nobleman (who had long known DON GASPERD, and who entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no doubts of his innocence, viſited France; he there ſaw at the Villa DE LAUNA, JULIA, and hearing her ſtory, immediately ſuppoſed he had found DON GASPERD'S neice; with this news,

he ſat off for Spain, and an edict to ſummon her to appear, was made out, but her maternal uncle, DON ELZIVER ſuppoſing this all a deception, and burning to revenge the murder of his niece, got an order from the King to the Ambaſſador, for JULIA to be arreſted as a culprit, and that ſecrecy ſhould be more ſtrictly adhered to, pledged himſelf in an oath, and had the ſame adminiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to CARLOS, the amiable ſon of DON GAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PERD, that ſhe ſhould not be informed of the cauſe of her confinement, till ſhe appeared before the Judges. Notwithſtanding the prejudice he cheriſhed, and which had convinced him, ſhe was an impoſtor; he was charmed with her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, majeſty, and innocence; her good ſenſe and artleſs, tho' brilliant remarks, he could not help admiring; and her extreme frankneſs, almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced him, that if ſhe was a deceiver, ſhe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was deceived; and tho' he wiſhed to releaſe her mind, he had ſtrictly adherd to the oath he had taken, while CARLOS had loſt his reaſon, in his admiration of her beauty and pity of her ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</p>
               <p>In this auguſt Court, before thouſands of ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators, before the opening of the cauſe, JULIA was informed of theſe particulars; and tho' ſhe could not prove that ſhe was not the neice, or any ways connected with her, yet a pre-ſentiment, perſuaded her, that ſhe was not; ſhe had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went a ſtrict examination, previous to the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; the clearneſs and preciſion of her anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, and her artleſs manner, and her own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, had convinced all, that ſhe was no impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. After this neceſſary delay, the trial went on,
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:039134_0117_1013B09F2BBA1F50"/>
and the Counſel on both ſides diſplayed talents and abilities, that could not ſail to pleaſe lovers of eloquence, although the ſubterfuges that they made uſe of, ſtruck the innocent heart of JULIA, with diſguſt. Several gentlemen, with true Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh gallantry, preſſed forward to ſupport and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend JULIA, who had no friend near her; (CAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOS being too much intereſted to witneſs a deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, upon which the life of his father depended;) ſhe was indulged with a ſeat, and her counten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance betrayed the various agitations of her mind.</p>
               <p>The advocate for the proſecutor, endeavored to prove, that JULIA was an impoſtor; that the real neice of DON GASPERD was murdered; they brought forward the perturbated ſtate of his mind; imputed his gloom to guilt; and expati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated upon his avarice, upon his equivocating with Don ELZIVER, of the falſhoods he had told him, and the many ſhifts he had made uſe of, to get rid of this affair; and now, ſaid one, he has found a needy adventurer, and has compromiſed the matter with her; and is willing to give up the fortune of the poor murdered orphan, rather than his own life.</p>
               <p>JULIA, could hardly refrain from ſpeaking, but her indignation ſparkled in her eyes, and was fluſhed upon every feature of her face.</p>
               <p>When it was time for the advocate upon the oppoſite ſide to ſpeak, he plead forcibly in behalf of his client, and endeavored to prove him inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of the crime alledged to him; when near the cloſe of his defence, he produced evidence to prove, that JULIA was under the protection of the Counteſs DE LAUNA, treated by her as a
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:039134_0118_1013B0A214EADFA8"/>
daughter; by the Marquis as a child, and entit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the will of both to an hundred thouſand crowns; is it likely (ſaid he) that ſo noble, ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted a female, as the Counteſs DE LAUNA, would become an accomplice in ſo dark an affair? Is it likely that the Marquis ALVADA would abet any one in a ſcheme, to rob a man of his right, or to protect his murderer? But, ſaid he, we have in the face of this lady, the faireſt and moſt convincing proof of her innocence, (and he threw up the gauze veil that ſhaded, but could not conceal her beauty,) look at her, added he, and ſay if ſhe can be guilty; does not innocence and every virtue appear in every feature; and appeal to every feeling heart, againſt the injuſtice done her? Does not the varying crimſon tell you, how great is her indignation at this inſult, and how much her ſoul would recoil at the idea of deception? I will not ſay that JULIA VALLACE is niece to Don GASPERD, but I will undertake to prove that ſhe is no impoſtor; he then endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ored to touch the feelings of all, by repreſenting in terms pathetic, the crime of injuring beauty and innocence; when unprotected by wealth or power; the horror of condemning a man upon any, but the moſt poſitive proofs, and the miſery that would be deſerved and endured, if Don GASPERD ſhould be condemned and ſuffer, and in any future period found innocent. The judges inquired, if JULIA had no one of the jewels about her, for which the infant had been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be ſtolen; the uncle ſaid that amongſt them was a miniature of her mother, and that ſhe had a mark upon her arm occaſioned by a burn.
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:039134_0119_1013B0A39FE38B30"/>
Upon inquiry, JULIA owned ſhe had worn a pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that ſhe had always ſuppoſed to be her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's, but by the direction of the perſon from whom ſhe received it, had kept it out of ſight; ſhe produced it, ſome perſons declared it to be the picture of DONNA ELVIRA, but moſt of thoſe who remembered that lady, thought it was not; they remarked that the eyes of DONNA ELVIRA were black, thoſe of the miniature a ſoft blue; the features and colour of the picture were rather mild, than ſtriking; they were rich and delicate; a penſiveneſs ſeemed ſpread over them while, DON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NA ELVIRA was ſparkling, and to ſome had the appearance of boldneſs, JULIA was remarked by all to reſemble the portrait; but DONNA ELVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RA, was different, though lovely. The picture was returned, and with a dignified modeſty, ſhe replaced it in her boſom.</p>
               <p>She was next queſtioned reſpecting the mark, and when the glove was pulled from her ſoft white arm, it was apparent to all. This was regarded as an unequivocal proof; but ſome of the judges wiſhed to defer a deciſion, till the Counteſs DE LAUNA could appear, but the parties and populace preſſed ſo loudly for an immediate ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, that they became decided in favor of Don GASPERD, and he was ſolemnly acquitted; and JULIA acknowledged as his niece, and the heireſs of his brother's fortune.</p>
               <p>Congratulations flew around the Court; Don GASPERD thanked the judges, and CARLOS who was informed of the happy iſſue of this dreaded trial, half breathleſs with joy ruſhed into the Court, and with frantic emotions embraced his
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:039134_0120_1013B0A5211EED78"/>
father, declared his gratitude, and kneeling before JULIA, acknowledged her as his beloved couſin, and the ſaviour of his father; his dutiful emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions intereſted every one in his behalf, for every one had long loved his virtues, and Don ELZI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VER forgot his ſuſpicions, and ſaluted JULIA as his niece.</p>
               <p>But amidſt this confuſion of joy, a groupe of four perſons entered the court; and preſſing forward, attracted the general obſervation; they conſiſted of Madam GYRON, who ſtood foremoſt; an old woman who had the appearance of a domeſtic; a modeſt, a pleaſing looking young man and woman, dreſſed in a moſt magnificent manner.</p>
               <p>The appearance of theſe perſons who advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the bench, regardleſs of forms, had ſo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted the curioſity, that when ſhe ſolemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded an audience, it was inſtantly granted.—Don GASPERD, grew pale at her approach, and JULIA could not conceal the joy, which animat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every lovely feature in her face; when ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held a friend of the Counteſs; inſtead of addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the court, ſhe turned to JULIA, ſhe took her hand with tenderneſs, ſhe preſſed it with venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to her lips, ſhall I give you pain, my dear, ſaid ſhe, if I prove to a demonſtration, that you are no ways connected with Don GASPERD; that not one drop of his blood <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

property of another. I am come to prove you are not his neice; I bring in my hands proofs that cannot be diſputed. Many perſons, ſaid ſhe, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round in this auguſt aſſembly, have already acknowledged that they recognize me, and I am ſure that the only child of Don FELIX DE GY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RON and his amiable CISILLA, will be acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged; in me you behold that injured daughter (ſhe ſtopt, as if overcome by the ſenſe of what ſhe was about to unfold) but what ſhe had already ſaid, had fixed attention and raiſed curioſity to that height of expectation, that a ſilence almoſt like death enſued; every face was impreſſed with the magnitude of what they imagined, they ſhould hear; and a ſtillneſs pervaded the court, uninterrupted by even a breath; ſhe continued, I am that child, and at the age of fifteen, was left by my father, the friend, and protector of Don GASPERD, to his guardianſhip; the conſequenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es have proved, how miſtaken my poor miſguided father was, in his choice, and how unworthy Don GASPERD was of the confidence repoſed in him; he ſeduced me from the paths of virtue, robbed me of my honour, ſtripped me of my fortune, and left me in obſcurity, to miſery, and want; by the death of a diſtant relation, a few years after, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came miſtreſs of a plentiful fortune; I had then enough to educate my ſon, the fruit of my ſhame and diſhonour; but my country was the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of my ſeducer, and was hateful to me; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to leave it, but before I went, inſtigated by revenge, I ſtole the infant orphan of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and with her nurſe conveyed her to France. I took care that her identity ſhould be proved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond

the power of even a doubt; I placed her in a convent, I educated her as my own, and three weeks ago I gave her to my ſon in marriage; do not heſitate one moment, to determine upon the truth of what I aſſert; here is the miniature of DONNA ELVIRA; her mother; here are the jewels that was upon her daughter when pilfered from her uncle's country-houſe; here is a paper that contains proof, that I ſtole, educated and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her; if other witneſſes are neceſſary, here is the nurſe, who has not lived one day from under the ſame roof with her. I acknowledge that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge ſtimulated me to commit this crime, and but for Madamoiſelle VALLACE, I ſhould have puſhed it ſtill farther; I ſaw at one view all the conſequences; I was the firſt that infuſed ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion into the minds of the populace, I had it hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Don ELZIVER; I kept it alive, and I meant to, till the law had, as I hoped it would, executed my full vengeance upon Don GASPERD, and his life, had paid the forfeit of my loſt honor: But when I heard that JULIA, the innocent, the amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble JULIA, was implicated in the affair, that ſhe was by ſome conſidered as an accomplice; I could delay no longer, and have come from France, to ſacrifice a juſt revenge upon the ſhrine of forgiveneſs and mercy; for this purpoſe, and this alone, I am come; here is the daughter of DONNA ELVIRA, and the niece of Don GAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PERD; if a doubt remains, let thoſe who knew her mother, look, and acknowledge the ſtriking likeneſs in her child: GOD has fixed it as an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible mark, to aſcertain the truth of what I have declared: this young man is my ſon, the ſon too
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:039134_0123_1013B0AE77608B50"/>
of Don GASPERD; and the huſband, of his niece. Here ſhe ſtopt, and it was impoſſible to withhold belief; the truth found its way into every heart, and every mind felt the force of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction.</p>
               <p>The reſemblance of the young lady, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by a large number of perſons, who had known her mother; the declaration of Madam GYRON, and the nurſe were admitted, and the decree in favor of JULIA reverſed; but her heart thus relieved from ſuſpence, her perſon at liberty, and her innocence owned by all, found a pleaſure that the wealth of <hi>Indoſtan,</hi> could not have beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſhe ſaw in rightful poſſeſſion of that fortune, that a miſtaken juſtice had but one hour before decreed to her, innocence, youth and beauty; ſhe ſaw her huſband apparently worthy; ſhe beheld Don GASPERD, though vicious, in many reſpects, cleared from an unjuſt aſperſion; Don ELZIVER, ſatiſfied, and though ſhe ſhuddered at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful character of Madam GYRON, yet ſhe remembered her misfortune and pitied her errors; ſhe ſaw too a proſpect of a ſpeedy return to France, and longed to converſe with Madam GYRON, alone.</p>
               <p>But to return from this digreſſion, Don GAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PERD, acknowledged the juſtice of the vengeance that he had ſo ſeverely ſuffered by, and offered every reparation in his power, owned her ſon, and embraced his niece with every mark of tenderneſs. Don ELZIVER, followed his example, and embrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her with more tenderneſs and more avidity, than he had JULIA, for though her perſon and talents were really ſuperior to thoſe of his niece,
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:039134_0124_1013B0B29B4C4418"/>
yet his heart bore teſtimony of the validity, of her claim; and nature, pleaded ſo powerfully in his boſom, and when he viewed the features and countenance of his ſiſter upon the face of her daughter, that the force of blood overpowered his fortitude, and he could not refrain his tears; as for the generous CARLOS, delighted that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence of his father, was ſo fully cleared, that his life was ſpared, and all parties reconciled, with all the warmth of fraternal affection, he embraced his new brother, and told him with what joy he ſhould divide his inheritance, and what was ſtill dearer, his father's affection with him.</p>
               <p>They all attended Madam GYRON, to her houſe, and every offer of reparation was made to JULIA, but the diſintereſted girl, who enjoyed the joys of others, found herſelf fully repaired for all ſhe had ſuffered, in finding thoſe ſufferings, the means of doing good.</p>

               <p>AS ſoon as a moment, could be found Madam GYRON, delivered a packet from the Counteſs, and the tenderly affectionate explanations which they contained, removed from her mind every remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anxiety. She was invited to return to France as ſoon as poſſible, but deſired to reſide with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam GYRON, until an opportunity preſented her with good company, as companions, and ſhe was empowered to draw upon a merchant in Spain for what money ſhe wanted; a letter too was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed from COLWORT, breathing forth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of a ſincere and affectionate heart; to her ſurpriſe, it was dated in Virginia, and near the reſidence, of the ſage of Mount Vernon,—It was as follows:—</p>

                     <p>How difficult is it, my deareſt JULIA, for the heart which within a very few days has vibrated with pleaſure, ſunk with horror, and throbbed with gratitude, to expreſs a tender and pure affection to the beſt and deareſt of women! How very different, to clothe its ſenſations, in language, that can be pleaſing to her affectionate boſom, and not unacceptable to her delicacy? but while I write, ſuch a croud of contending emotions,
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:039134_0126_1013B0B6CD6CC098"/>
preſs upon my mind, that I know not how, to preſerve conſiſtence, or method, in this letter of narrative, for ſuch it will be; yes, my JULIA! the man whom you have honored, with your eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem; the man who triumphs in the dear idea of calling you his; the man whoſe chief delight ſhall be to make you happy, has ſhuddered with the fear of loſing theſe ineſtimable titles; he has been in the very ſhadow of death, and trembled upon the very verge of eternity.</p>

                     <p>And in the moment, when ſtruggling nature worn out, with a long, and arduous conteſt, was about to quit the wearied frame forever, the image of JULIA, was before my eves, and ſeemed to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid an approaching diſſolution; it was then that I found how much dearer you were to me than life; how much dearer, than all that life contains beſides you! It was in that tremendous moment, that every dear friend and beloved connexion, preſſed upon my recollection, that a multitude of ſins preſented themſelves to my view, and but for the idea of a SAVIOUR, would have added to the dreadful ſcene, terrors too diſtracting to have been ſupported with reaſon; but I caſt them upon him, who is willing to ſave; and even then a bright gleam of hope, illuminated the dreary proſpect, and pointed to a futurity, where no ſtorm ſhall diſturb the calm, of everlaſting hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>

I am ſometimes ſo loſt, to the diſtance that is between us, and ſo pleaſed to recollect the cord that ſo ſtrongly drew us together, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twined a mutual affection, from the day of our firſt acquaintance, that I feel as though every tranſaction of each muſt be known to each other, and often in my mind's eye, behold the fair form of my JULIA, and look to ſee if an approving ſmile irradiates her charming countenance; it is then, that the ſoft deluſion; the flattering dream ceaſes to deceive me, and reality, ſad reality, places three thouſand long, long miles, between us; but neither time, nor diſtance, can irradicate the tender and ſtrong attachment, that your virtues have impreſſed upon my heart, for it has ſtood the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Finding it impoſſible to procure a paſſage from Hollowel, to either France or Great-Britain, I found ſome difficulty in perſuading my poor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate couſin, to leave a place where ſhe had received a thouſand attentions, and kindneſſes, from the inhabitants, who are poſſeſſed of every ſocial and hoſpitable virtue, for Boſton, which had been the ſcene of her moſt ſevere afflictions. She was greatly altered, and wiſhed not to aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate with the gay, or the great; indeed ſhe wiſhed
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:039134_0128_1013B0BC6CE06358"/>
to be ſecreted from all the world, till in the arms of her parents, her faults and ſorrows were forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. She yeilded to neceſſity, and my entreaties; and with her lovely infant accompanied me, to Boſton; a paſſage ſoon preſented, and we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked on board the two Friends, bound for London, on the tenth of this month. The ſhip was large and convenient, and every comfort, was procured, that could render the voyage agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, to my fair companion, and her infant charge; for the firſt day the wind was freſh and favorable, but upon the next, it changed, and our courſe was altered: it continued unfavorable, without any violence, until the twentieth, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the night of the nineteenth, when a dreadful ſtorm commenced, with a violence that aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our ableſt ſeamen; until twelve o'clock, of the ſucceeding day, our veſſel ſtood its heavieſt ſhocks, and the riſing billows ſeemed not to affect her tall maſts and hardy ſides; but then we ſtruck againſt a ſunken rock, and with a moſt tremendous noiſe, both main and foremaſt come upon the deck, and were levelled with the ocean.</p>
                     <p>It would be impoſſible to paint, the horrors of our ſituation; the water now poured into the ſides of the ſhip, with a dreadful roar, and ſpeedy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, ſtared us in the face; in this ſtate our ſhip fixed firmly to the rock; every heart ſeemed to ſink; and as the laſt reſource, the long boat was got out, and it was unanimouſly agreed to leave the veſſel, which in a very few hours muſt go to pieces: it was then I had a proof of the ſtrong effects of maternal affection, no perſuaſion could prevail upon my couſin, to truſt her child in
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:039134_0129_1013B0C030E8D7F0"/>
the arms of any one, but herſelf; her maid had before croſſed the atlantic; and to the honor of woman, be it ſpoken, acted with as much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of mind, as the oldeſt ſeaman on board; but not for one moment would ſhe truſt her dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with her. She held him faſt, preſſed to her boſom, and the little fellow ſeemed to think his mother, his beſt protector, for he hung around her neck, and hid his little face upon her ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, while her fears ſeemed only for him. In this ſtate, while every ſea daſhed over us, and every other moment buried us beneath a wave; with the utmoſt difficulty we got her into the boat, and while I was preparing to follow, a billow foam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with redoubled fury, parted it from the ſhip, and left me behind. It was not without the moſt diſtreſſing emotions, I ſaw it borne aloft upon the top of the ſurge, and anon, overwhelmed in the ſea. I was the only one left upon the wreck, as my ſervant had taken upon himſelf the care of MARY, who was in the boat before, her lady. For ſome time I followed it with my eyes, and ſaw it buffeting the ſtorm, when I beheld a man plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the ocean, and ſwim towards the wreck. Judge what was my aſtoniſhment, when I found this to be the faithful fellow, who had attended me, as a ſervant, and finding I was not with the crew, choſe rather to ſhare the fate of his maſter, than ſeek ſafety without him. He was an able ſwimmer, and ſoon reached the veſſel, which he entered with more apparent pleaſure, than he had left it; my heart was melted at this proof of his affection; and he immediately propoſed to get the ſmall boat out, and try, if in that, we could
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:039134_0130_1013B0C1B2936728"/>
not reach the ſhore, which we now ſaw within a few miles; with amazing exertion, we at laſt ſucceeded, and having got the boat into the ſea, jumped into her, and in leſs than a minute the ſhip parted in the middle, and diſappeared from our view; we now endeavored to row to land; but our hands were benumbed with cold, and we were too feeble to go at any great rate; however we were within one half mile of it, when a w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ave overturned our ſmall boat, and we were thrown into the ſea! It was here, that death in its moſt dreadful ſhape, preſented itſelf to my view; but in a few moments, my ſenſes were loſt, and even JULIA, was ſhut out from my imagination. I cannot deſcribe as I ought the ſucceeding ſcenes, and therefore will paſs them by. When I came to myſelf, I found I was ſurrounded by negroes, who were doing all in their power to recall the vital ſpark, which ſeemed totally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed. Before I could open my eyes, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold theſe ſooty ſons of Africa, the fair viſion of my beloved JULIA, flitted before my imagination, and revived my fleeting ſpirits. My bodily pains were exquiſite, nor was my mind compoſed. It was ſometime before I could conceive of my ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and I had ſtared around with vacant, but aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhed looks, upon the ſurrounding objects, when the plaintive voice of my couſin, caught my attention; ſhe was in terms quite incoherent; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting my fate, and blaming herſelf as the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of my death. But when ſhe ſaw that I was alive, her joy became almoſt frantic, and I found by her frequent addreſſes to her boy, that his life was preſerved. Gratitude taught me to enquire
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:039134_0131_1013B0C46351CB38"/>
for my ſervant, as ſoon as I could uſe my voice, and my couſin told me, he was juſt recovering his recollection in an adjoining hut. She then informed me, the crew in the long boat, had got ſale on ſhore, and that we all owed our lives to the hoſpitality of theſe Negroes. I never had entertained that narrow prejudice, that affects ſome people, that a dark ſkin, cannot cover a fair heart. It is the complexion of the mind that ſtamps the man, a wretch or an hero; but ſtill I was ſurpriſed, at the kindneſs and attention of theſe ſlaves. Upon enquiry, I found we were upon the eſtate of the beſt and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt man, in the world; and that theſe kind pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors were the ſervants, or rather humble friends, of the Illuſtrious WASHINGTON; from him they had learnt to follow the dictates of humanity, to obey the impulſe of benevolence, and to tread the broad paths of philanthropy. See, my deareſt JULIA what the example of the great and truly noble, may do; theſe people are in a ſtate of hoſtility with all civilzed nations; the love of ſelf preſervation teaches them ſo to be; in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, more at variance, with their maſters, than with any others; nor is this to be wondered at; for their maſters are their tyrants. Yet behold them here performing every kind office; nor is this ſurpriſing, they are the ſervants of WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON; this wonderful man has made them happy, and learns them to make others ſo. Oh, my JULIA could the limits of a letter permit it, I could tell thee ſuch things of this man; could paint his domeſtic virtues, in ſuch a light; and inform thee of the thouſand acts of virtue and
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:039134_0132_1013B0C846A10198"/>
benevolence, as would fill thy gentle boſom with ſurprize and pleaſure; but it is what this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance will not permit; ſuffice it to ſay, we are at preſent foſtered in the boſom of this virtuous and noble family, whoſe revered chief, is my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, friend, and benefactor; he has put it in my power, to proſecute my voyage; and as ſoon as my couſin is ſufficiently recruited, we ſhall proceed from here to Philadelphia, and then take paſſage for London; and I hope by the permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Providence, to be with my deareſt JULIA by the firſt of June, there to claim the promiſed bleſſing; and receive the richeſt preſent, heaven in its indulgence, could beſtow. I ſhall not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the dangers I have eſcaped, nor the mercies I have received; but truſt your own feelings for a copy of my reflections; adieu my JULIA, join your prayers with mine, that the life of the beſt of men, may long be ſpared to his revering country, and his excellent family, and to add to the happineſs of JULIA, and her,</p>

               <p>Before the reading of her letters, JULIA, had retired, to a magnificent apartment, that was by Madam GYRON's direction, prepared for her; and joy in tumultuous tides ruſhed upon her mind, ſo as to deprive her, when ſhe reflected upon the events of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <p>IT was late in the morning when ſhe awoke, and her firſt thought, was to return immediately to France; anxious to embrace her friends, ſhe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got the difficulty that might attend her journey.</p>
               <p>Upon joining her friends below, ſhe found CARLOS with them, whoſe impaſſioned looks declared, how tender his feelings towards her were, he made the moſt affectionate inquiries for her health, and upon bearing her reſolution, joined Madam GYRON and her ſon and daughter, in perſuading her to tarry, till ſome of her friends were going to France, unleſs ſhe would permit him to attend, which he moſt ardently wiſhed to do; as ſhe could not be prevailed upon to accept this propoſal, ſhe concluded to tarry a week or two, till a gentleman and lady who called to ſee Madam, and who being about to travel to Paris, requeſted the pleaſure of conducting her, to her friends. Of this invitation ſhe accepted, and the concluſion gave great pleaſure to the family, ſhe was with, who all began, not only to admire, but to love her.</p>
               <p>In the courſe of twenty years, Madam GYRON had to calm the perturbation of a mind ill at eaſe; viſited almoſt every city in Europe, ſhe had by
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:039134_0134_1013B0CC7A02F3C0"/>
turns, partaken of all their amuſements, and for a ſeaſon, entered into all their diſſipations, but ſhe found it an ineffectual cure for a diſeaſed mind, and ſought in vain for a remedy, while ſhe nurſed that deadly paſſion, and bore about her all the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered malice, of indignant reputation and loſt hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. She was wealthy, and her liberality gave her friends and flatterers; her talents and her accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments had procured her both admirers and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emies; but her temper was ſoured by ill-treatment, and diſappointed love; and ſhe was at times ſo capricious, as to quarrel with thoſe ſhe loved beſt. This unhappy propenſity involved her in many difficulties, and in the midſt of her chagrin, ſhe ſometimes ſought in ſolitude, a relief, that ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty could not give her.</p>
               <p>Solitude, is indeed a relief, to a wounded ſpirit; it is a balm, to a diſtempered mind; but it is inſufficient to thoſe, who cheriſh an unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving temper; for in ſolitude, we look in upon our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and we cannot forgive the injuries we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. The inveſtigation muſt diſtreſs us, and we turn from a retroſpect ſo diſguſting. As for Madam GYRON, ſhe had never found a wiſh to forgive Don GASPERD, and of conſequence, thoſe retirements that gave leiſure and time for reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, convinced her it was her duty to forgive him, had become irkſome and diſguſting to her; to have heard of his death, would have diſtreſſed her, if death had approached in the natural way; for to ſuch an height was her thirſt of vengeance carried, that ſhe ſometimes enjoyed in idea, the pleaſure ſhe ſhould receive, in being the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal agent, to inflict an ignominious death. It was
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:039134_0135_1013B0CE022BB5B8"/>
in vain for ſuch a mind, to ſeek for peace; ſhe firſt began to feel compunction, when ſhe return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to France, and beheld her ſon amiable and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed; ſhe then contemplated his marriage with Don GASPERD's niece, who was truly lovely. She almoſt forgot her ſcheme of vengeance, and hearing at that time, he was really under arreſt, and that JULIA was likewiſe implicated in that affair; ſhe formed a reſolution of going directly to Spain, and laid a plan of proceedings which ſhe put in execution, as has been already narrated.</p>
               <p>She had now acknowledged her crime; made all the reparation in her power; a perfect recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation had taken place; her mind was freed from the ſting of a wounded conſcience; from intended iniquity; her temper ſweetened; and in the ſociety of her amiable ſon, and daughter, ſhe forgot ſhe had ever been injured. Or being ſo, ceaſed to think of it; her natural cheerfulneſs returned. Her unbounded wealth, put it in her power to gratify every whim, and ſhe now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played her taſte and elegance, by magnificent balls, and entertainments, in honour of the newly married pair. In theſe, ſhe imitated the faſhion of almoſt every court in Europe; balls, operas, maſquerades, and routs, at which all the nobility and gentry at M—, were invited, with all the ſtrangers of faſhion; and the Spaniards for a while forgot their ſtately gravity, and mingled in the motley dance of the ſprightly Frenchman, and liſtened to the ſoft muſic of the enervated Italian.</p>
               <p>JULIA was obliged to partake in all theſe diſſipating ſcenes; ſhe was followed, flattered, and
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:039134_0136_1013B0D317675D10"/>
careſſed; and indeed her perſon was ſo lovely as to attract univerſal attention; while the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her manners and affability, gained her the love and admiration of all; though her cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs charmed every heart, her perfect prudence, and innate delicacy, ſeemed to repel every impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety; and her admirers, declared that the ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhe created, were ſuch a mixture of reſpect, love, eſteem, and friendſhip, that they had never been ſenſible of before.</p>
               <p>At firſt the novelty of every thing carried a charm that could not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ail to delight her; but they would not bear repeating; they palled upon reflection, and ſhe ſoon grew ſick of this contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual round of amuſement, where not one moment was given to thought; and reflection was ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed, by gaiety; and ſhe longed for the quiet ſcenes of the Villa, where ſentiment gave a zeſt to every enjoyment; and virtuous and rational amuſements, rendered every ſcene pleaſant, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, and inſtructive. She ſighed for the ſociety of her benefactreſs, and longed again to attend the venerable Marquis; ſhe ſaw much company, but found little ſociety; ſhe gained many ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, but her heart ſickened for the bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of friendſhip; ſhe was introduced with ecla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, to a great deal of the gay world; but ſhe found, but little ſubſtantial enjoyment; and after a day ſpent in gaiety, and what is uſually termed pleaſure, ſhe retired with regret, to her own apartment, affrighted upon reflection, that ſhe could recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect no praiſeworthy action, or uſeful purſuit. There ſhe always found ANNET, who recollected that Madamoiſelle had loſt much of her color,
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:039134_0137_1013B0D5D2EC3918"/>
and was thinner, then ſhe had been at the Villa.</p>
               <p>With Donna ELVIRA, ſhe had but a few leiſure moments. That lady was indeed amiable, but ſhe had juſt eſcaped from a convent, to enjoy all that love, wealth, and rank could beſtow. She loved her huſband, and his mother; ſhe found the world as gay as ſhe wiſhed it, and as happy; every one was intereſted for her, and ſhe was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted by every thing. She had been uſhered into life, in too extraordinary a manner, not to engage the attention of all, upon firſt fight; and ſhe went from one ſcene to another, with aſtoniſhing avidity.</p>
               <p>Her huſband, who had made the tour of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, and was well acquainted with the world, was pleaſed with ſo new a character, and as he loved her, likewiſe loved to gratify all her wiſhes, but he did not then ſee, the danger to which a lovely, young, unexperienced woman, is expoſed; indeed he was really good, and had but very little of the Spaniard, in him; yet he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times looked beyond the preſent, trifling period; and with ſome degree of impatience, contemplat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſcheme of retirement, and ſighed for a more rational life.</p>
               <p>CARLOS was the only one, except this gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, in whosſe ſociety JULIA, could really take pleaſure; their good ſenſe, and extenſive know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, was a fund of information, and gave her much ſatisfaction; for CARLOS, ſhe felt a kind of fraternal friendſhip. He was amiable, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of it; but ſhe feared to indulge the ſocial intercourſe, that true friendſhip requires; for not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, the pains he took to ſuppreſs his feelings, ſhe ſaw that he loved her, with enthuſiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:039134_0138_1013B0D754BC2AA0"/>
paſſion; but in the huſband of Donna ELVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RA, ſhe found a friend, who eſteemed her perſon; revered her virtues; admired her talents, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whoſe advice ſhe could depend.</p>
               <p>Two weeks, and double that time had elapſed, and ſtill ſhe waited for her companions; ſhe grew every day more impatient, to return, and when at the end of another week, ſhe was informed that they would ſet out in three days, ſhe was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with joy.</p>
               <p>Madam GYRON, who loved her fair gueſt, determined to give a maſked ball, as a particular compliment before her departure. It was to be after the Engliſh faſhion, and cards of invitation, were diſtributed to all her acquaintance.</p>
               <p>JULIA, had from her earlieſt infancy, accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed herſelf to do that which her conſcience would approve; however ſhe might be perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the contrary. She had an innate and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſe of female propriety, and never had ſhe once deviated from it. She had always thought it, highly inconſiſtent, with the true dignity of a young woman, to appear in a borrowed character. For this reaſon, ſhe refuſed any garb, that would diſguiſe herſelf; or for one moment miſlead ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Madam GYRON, perſuaded in vain, and her eloquence was all loſt, upon her fair inflexible. I cannot, my dear Madam, ſaid ſhe; indeed I cannot act in a character, that providence has not given me; it has placed me in a very humble ſtation; it has alloted me a very plain and eaſy part; it is my duty to perform it well; nor will I militate againſt its decree, by taking one that is not aſſigned me. You are very humble indeed,
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:039134_0139_1013B0DA0D896C70"/>
my dear, (replied Madam,) but ſurely your mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſty and humility, will not be offended at the dreſs and character of a nun. But (cried JULIA,) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my conſcience, or inclination, would permit me to be a recluſe; I muſt refuſe, and beg you will no longer perſuade me. But indeed, I ſhall be a queen then; what aſſume the appearance of royalty! My moſt ambitious thoughts never aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired to it, for one moment. Strange girl, (cried Madam,) be a ſhepherdeſs then. Not by any means, Madam, I do not aſpire to be above my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and I do not mean to deſcend. You ſhould remember, my dear JULIA, that you are the friend and companion of the Counteſs DE LAU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NA, and by appearing with propriety, you do hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to her election, and attachment; but if you do not, you diſgrace her choice. I am perſuaded, returned JULIA, very ſeriouſly, that my preſent conduct would meet with her approbation; I ſhall dreſs in a manner much above myſelf; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I will ſhew the world, I glory in being her dependent; that I am indebted to her, not only for the conveniencies of life, but for its elegancies: But after all, I will not forget, that I am a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cottage girl; and the child of her bounty; is the plain, and ſimple JULIA VALLACE. But I am ſure, replied Madam, that the Counteſs would not have your appearance ſo ſingular, as to occaſion remarks. I know my dear Madam, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding your kindneſs, (ſaid JULIA,) that I am really too inſignificant, to attract much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, if my conduct is inconſiſtent with the ettiquette of the place, it will be attributed to ignorance, and in a few days at fartheſt forgotten;
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:039134_0140_1013B0DDE03698E8"/>
but if I did that, which I was conſcious was wrong, I am ſure the ſenſe of it would hurt me for many years, and embitter ſome of my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanteſt moments. Well then, replied Madam, take your own way; for I find you will not adopt mine. Pray, my dear Madam, (ſaid JULIA,) do not be offended, nor impute my refuſal to obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy; there are few things, I would not do to oblige you; I muſt ever feel under a thouſand obligations, that I can never return to you; and I hate the appearance of ingratitude. Tell me that you are not angry with me. Embracing her with affection, Madam aſſured her, ſhe did not think it poſſible, for any one to be offended with her: I have but one fault, to find with you, ſaid ſhe, you are too good, and too ſubmiſſive; I wiſh you were not half ſo faultleſs. JULIA kiſſed her hand, and went to her chamber, where ſhe dreſſed herſelf in a ſtile of elegance, ſuperior to what ſhe had ever worn.</p>
               <p>The rooms were hardly opened, before ſhe found herſelf ſurrounded, by characters of all deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criptions; from the king to the link boy; from the queen, to the opera girl; Dutcheſes, and noſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gay women; nurſes, and women of eaſy virtue; biſhops and ſailors; and in general, ſhe could not help obſerving, that people aſſumed thoſe charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters they like beſt, and in which they are the leaſt likely to ſhine, as they were moſt oppoſite to thoſe which providence had aſſigned them. She ſoon diſcovered CARLOS, whoſe impaſſioned voice, the moment he addreſſed her, rendered his maſk an inſufficient diſguiſe. At firſt, ſhe was pleaſed with the motley ſcene, and the remarks
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:039134_0141_1013B0E08981D298"/>
ſhe made to CARLOS, declared her pleaſure, and told at the ſame time, how ſoon it tired.</p>
               <p>Juſt as the company were ſummoned to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, a tall maſk offered to tell her fortune; ſhe held out her hand, and deſired he would exert his utmoſt ſkill. I will tell you one thing, fair lady, (he ſaid,) while he examined the ſpotleſs palm of JULIA, you will meet with a ſad diſappointment; the friends you mean to viſit, you will not ſee for ſome time, and many is the trial, that you will go through, before you are ſo fortunate.</p>
               <p>Though JULIA had never given credit to aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy; though her heart revolted at ſuperſtition; though ſhe knew her informer acted in a borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed character; yet ſo perverſe is the human heart, that ſhe felt her ſpirits depreſſed for a moment; the prediction caſt a ſhade upon her cheerfulneſs; and gave a ſombre tincture, to the ideas, that had before ſprung from the gay ſcene; which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded her, and hope of more rational enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>After ſupper, ſhe danced with CARLOS, and the company did not ſeparate till morning; ſhe retired languid and fatigued, to her chamber; and a diſturbed ſleep followed the hurry and buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the night.</p>

               <p>WHEN ſhe awoke from a diſturbed ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſhe found herſelf much indiſpoſed; a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent head-ach, cold, ſhivering fit, and a difficulty of breathing, declared her really ſick; ſhe how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever got up, and as ſhe was to ſet out for France, the day following; ſhe determined not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, attributing it to the fatigues of the preceding evening. She found her appetite intirely gone, and her attempts at cheerfulneſs and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, was vain, and ſhe was obliged to retire early, and take a medicine, that her friends pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for her.</p>
               <p>She was ſo determined to be well the next morning, that when ſhe aroſe after a ſleepleſs night, ſhe perſuaded herſelf, that ſhe really was ſo,
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:039134_0143_1013B0E38E1F72B0"/>
and with trembling hands, and limbs that could ſcarce ſupport herſelf, ſhe put on her riding habit, and aſſiſted ANNET to put up her things; and was quite ready, when Madam GYRON entered the chamber and informed her that her traveling companions were come by appointment, to break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt with her, and would ſet off immediately after.</p>
               <p>It was with difficulty ſhe got down to the breakfaſt parlor; and there her altered looks were obſerved by all; who united to perſuade her to defer her journey, for a few days longer, or at leaſt, till ſhe was better; ſhe aſſured them ſhe thought the excurſion, would be of ſervice to her, and that ſhe did not doubt ſhe ſhould be quite well, before ſhe had been an hour in the carriage; as they ſaw her heart was much ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on going, they did not oppoſe it, but after break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, of which ſhe did not taſte, when ſhe aroſe to bid farewell to the friends ſhe was leaving, and attend thoſe with whom ſhe was going, ſhe fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered and ſunk into a chair, unable to ſupport her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a moment longer, and was carried back to her chamber, almoſt inſenſible of every thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round her.</p>
               <p>The exertions of this morning, and of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding day, had ſo accelerated the progreſs of her diſorder, that ſhe found it impoſſible, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the violence with which ſhe was attacked.</p>
               <p>A phyſician was immediately ſent for, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his arrival, did not heſitate to declare, ſhe had taken the ſmall pox; the eruption began to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and ſhe grew delirious.</p>
               <p>The family had before had this diſeaſe, ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, to female beauty; yet they were thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:039134_0144_1013B0E8B0780138"/>
to unuſual conſternation; the manners of JULIA had been ſo attractive, ſo mild, and unaſſuming; her voice ſo ſweet, and her whole conduct ſo gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, that every domeſtic in Madam GYRON's houſe was diſtreſſed at her ſickneſs, and intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in her recovery. As for ANNET, unable to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the fortitude of her miſtreſs, ſhe became al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt diſtracted, and was obliged to leave an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, in which her diſtreſs, was ſo loud, as to diſturb the patient.</p>
               <p>Madam GYRON and her daughter never left her for a moment; the beſt of nurſes were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, and the ableſt of the faculty conſulted, and every thing done to render ſickneſs bearable; for the firſt ſeven days, the poor ſufferer was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible, to her pains, and her diſorder wore an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, ſo alarming, as to be pronounced mortal; but upon the eighth, it aſſumed a more favourable appearance, and came to a criſis that flattered them, with hopes of the moſt happy event; it was then that ſhe recovered her recollection, and knew the perſons around her.</p>
               <p>Madam GYRON wiſhed to make her ſuppoſe, that ſhe had been ſick with a fever; but the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition did not take, and ſhe begged to be informed what was the nature of ſo diſtreſſing a malady. Her mind was ſo debilitated by her ſuffering, that it ſhared in her corporeal weakneſs; and when ſhe learned ſhe had the ſmall-pox, ſhe ſhed ſome tears; but in a few hours, ſhe gathered ſtrength ſufficient to aſſiſt her fortitude, and ſhe returned fervent thanks to heaven for her returning health, and was perfectly ſatisfied, that the intire loſs of beauty, ſhould be the conſequence, of her illneſs.
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:039134_0145_1013B0EB5A35BB68"/>
She recovered by ſlow degrees; the tranquillity of her ſpirits, and patience, aided every medicine; at firſt her friends ſuppoſed the ravages made in her perſon, would be dreadful, but were agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly diſappointed, to find as ſhe recovered, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion wore out, and before ſhe was able to leave her chamber, ſcarce a mark remained.</p>
               <p>Madam GYRON, had deferred writing to the Counteſs, till ſhe was better, and intirely out of danger, as ſhe knew it would be impoſſible, for her to take a journey, at that time, and ſhe wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſave her from the pains of ſuſpence; ſo that the very next poſt after ſhe heard of her ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhe received a letter from JULIA, informing her that ſhe ſhould ſoon be able to commence her journey, to France; the benevolent heart of this worthy woman, was rejoiced at this news, and ſhe ſent off one of her own carriages, with her woman, and two men ſervants, to wait upon JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIA from Spain, and fraught with letters, breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt tenderly affectionate expreſſions, from the Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uis, as well as his ſiſter.</p>
               <p>JULIA was ſo much delighted at this proof of the Counteſs's attachment, that it accelerated her perfect recovery, and rendered her doubly impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to be with friends, whoſe affection, even ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence and affliction could not leſſen. She had it in her power, to reward ever perſon, in Madam GYRON's houſe, for every trouble ſhe had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned, and for the various proofs they had given of their regard, and attachment. And with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled gratitude, and affection; with many tears and few profeſſions, ſhe took leave of friends that ſhe found herſelf bound to, by ties of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:039134_0146_1013B0ECDC10E7F0"/>
and obligation; and ſet off for France, ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en weeks after ſhe had prepared to go there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>The ſon of Madam GYRON, and the excellent CARLOS accompanied her for two days, and then le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t her to finiſh her journey, only with her do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtics. CARLOS wiſhed to have gone ſtill farther, and even to Paris, but ſhe excuſed herſelf from conſenting to this requeſt. She eſteemed and valued this young gentleman, but ſhe was not blind to the progreſs that an hopeleſs paſſion had made in his heart and conſtitution, and longed for that abſence, that ſhe thought would eaſe, what could not be rewarded. This young gentleman im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after his return to M—, embarked for London, hoping by change of ſcene, and a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of objects, to eraſe in ſome meaſure from his heart, an attachment, that rendered him wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>For ſeveral days ſhe travelled unmoleſted; but when with in half a days journey of Paris, when ſhe was in anticipation, of enjoying the embraces of the Marquis, and his ſiſter, and longing to ſpring from the carriage to their arms; the coach was ſtopped by four men, on horſeback; one of whom opened the door, and deſired JULIA to alight; at firſt ſhe ſuppoſed the perſons footpads, and offered them her purſe, while her waiting woman and ANNET produced theirs for the ſame purpoſe; but the men refuſed the money, and told her it was herſelf they wanted; the woman clung around her, but her cries and their entreaties were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually vain; they dragged her from the carriage; and ſeated her in a chaiſe, that was in waiting, and
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:039134_0147_1013B0EE817F8B80"/>
two of them entered with her and bid the poſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion drive on.</p>
               <p>This tranſaction ſeemed performed by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of magic; and ſhe found herſelf between two ruffians, and almoſt before ſhe had the power to recollect herſelf. But when ſhe looked behind and ſaw her own carriage driving ſlowly the oppoſite way, ſhe grew almoſt diſtracted, her reaſon was upon the point of deſerting her; and in language almoſt frantic, ſhe demanded to know by what authority they had forced her from her ſervants, and begged to be reſtored to her friends. One of the men replied, he acted by the direction of a maſter, whom it was his duty to obey, and that ſhe was going were ſhe would find ſervants e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and friends too, if it was not her own fault.</p>
               <p>She found arguments thrown away, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties loſt, and knew it was worſe than folly to attempt reſiſtance, ſhe therefore was ſilent, revolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in her own mind the probable conſequence of this event. But to what end were her conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and how impoſſible for her to conceive the extent of the horrors that now ſurrounded her. Her tears flowed without controul, and ſhe ſat back in the chaiſe quite abſorbed in grief, while her companions did not notice her, and engaged in a converſation that would if ſhe had attended too, given her a worſe opinion of them, than ſhe could conceive any one of the human race deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But her thoughts were buſily employed by the Marquis, the Counteſs, and her lover, whom her imagination painted as diſtreſſed at her ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and endeavouring in vain to reſcue her. A
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:039134_0148_1013B0F3DFC1BAF0"/>
gleam of hope ſometimes appeared to aſſure her, that ſuch active meaſures would be taken, that ſhe ſhould be reſtored to her friends. A youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful mind, and a good one, will always form ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, that ſome fortunate event, may reſtore the bleſſings they have loſt, and preſent thoſe they wiſh for; while judgment, matured by frequent diſappointment, and by miſfortunes, will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the hope, romantic, and the wiſh vain, and futile.</p>
               <p>The little acquaintance ſhe had made in the world, had convinced her of the power of mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Her purſe was well filled, and ſhe hoped by that means to procure her liberty. She did not doubt but the Count was her perſecutor, ſhe ſtill dreaded his power, yet flattered herſelf that ſhe ſhould be able, with the aſſiſtance and care of heaven, to elude his arts, and eſcape the evils he had prepared for her; upon obſerving one of the men with attention, ſhe thought ſhe had ſee him before. He was tall, and had a ſtoop in his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and while ſhe endeavoured to recollect, when his voice convinced her, that he was the fortune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teller, that had foretold her diſappointment at the maſquerade. In this conjecture, ſhe was right; for this fellow had watched her motion from her firſt arrival in Spain, and had got information of every ſtep ſhe had taken, determined that ſhe ſhould be diſappointed; it was not very ſurpriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he was quite a ſkillful aſtrologer. Her ſickneſs had at that time prevented his execution of a plan, of which he was a diabolical agent, to a no leſs diabilocal ſuperior.</p>
               <p>In theſe reflections, the day was ſpent; and
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:039134_0149_1013B0F561C28460"/>
night coming on, a full moon ſhewed her a vaſt extent of woods and plains, while ſhe ſeemed to be travelling above them; indeed the carriage had aſcended a long ridge of hills, and went over a very rough road, with aſtoniſhing velocity. It was after midnight, they deſcended into a level plain, and ſoon after ſtopped at a lofty manſion, that ſeemed to have bid defiance to the hand of time. It was large, ſpacious and magnificent. But its brown walls, and lofty turretts informed the traveller, that it had been built in times of old; they entered by a large gate, that opened upon a court that was occupied by a variety of buildings, and that ſtood at the back of the chatteau. She was then taken from the carriage, and a large bell that hung at the portal of the door, was rung, to give notice of their arrival.</p>
               <p>It was ſome time before any one came, and ſhe had full time to ſurvey the moon, which in full orbed majeſty, now ſhone from its meridian height; ſhe ſighed, when ſhe thought of various regions it overlooked, and aſked her heart if one more wretched then herſelf, now gazed upon it. Perhaps at that very time, COLWORT was look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon that chaſte planet; perhaps too, his thoughts were as ardently fixed upon her, as hers were upon wretchedneſs. Oh could he but know, (ſaid ſhe,) how quick, he would fly to my relief! Her meditations were diſturbed by the appearance of two women, and a man ſervant, who were not half dreſſed. Well, ſaid the man, you are come at laſt; we have been looking for you, this three days. And a good look out you have kept, ſaid one of her conductors; here you
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:039134_0150_1013B0F819511FF8"/>
are all aſleep, while you ought to have been upon the watch. Come get us ſome ſupper, cried ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; we are ſharp ſet, and will eat all you have in the houſe. The devil a bit have I taſted, ſince five o'clock laſt night; and you SUSAN, do you look to this young woman, and ſee that ſhe has <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>very thing, that is comfortable.</p>
               <p>JULIA followed the woman acroſs a large hall, and up a winding ſtaircaſe; ſhe then croſſed two old faſhioned, but magnificent chambers, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paſſing two or three ſmall entries, ſtopped at a chamber, where the woman ſet down the light. This ſhe found was the end of her journey; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued with riding eighteen or twenty hours, ſhe would gladly have reſted, but a dreadful fear pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented her ſetting down; ſhe knew this muſt be the Count DE LAUNA's Chateau; ſhe had heard much of it, and what ſhe had ſeen, anſwered the deſcription; beſides ſhe ſaw hid beneath the horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's coat, the DE LAUNA livery upon ſeveral of the men. She now turned to one of the women and aſked if her lord was at home. No Madam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oiſelle, he is in Paris; how long has he been ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, (aſked JULIA, taking courage at her anſwer,) it is ſix month's ſince he was here; and then only for a few days, with ſome friends. And when is he expected, demanded JULIA! In a fortnight, (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the girl,) his father the Marquis, has been ſick, but is now getting better. But (cryed the other, miſtaking the cauſe of her enquiries,) you ſhall be as well treated, as though he was here, and want for nothing, Madamoiſelle; to this odd rejoinder, JULIA did not reply. You look ſadly fatigued, Madamoiſelle, (ſaid one of the women;)
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:039134_0151_1013B0F99C0F3270"/>
you had better take ſome refreſhment, and go to bed. Diſappointed, diſtreſſed, chagrined, and fatigued as JULIA was, ſhe had not learned to doubt the veracity of any one; and miſtruſt, was not added to the catalogue of evils, ſhe now endured. What the girl had told her was ſtrictly true, but one more acquainted with deceit, would have doubted her word. Thus, conſcious innocence, though not its own protector, is a ſhield againſt ſuſpicion, and a comforter in diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>She was ſo delighted to find the Count was abſent, that almoſt half her woes were loſt in that joy. She accepted the propoſed refreſhment, and went to bed, committing herſelf to the care of that power, whoſe eye pervades the abode of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and haunts of miſery; and enjoyed ſeveral hours of interrupted repoſe.</p>

               <p>WHEN ſhe awoke, the horrors of her ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation ruſhed upon her mind; ſhe had not as formerly, ANNET, as a companion; that faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful girl, who was a comforter to her in her priſon; a nurſe in her ſickneſs, and a friend in her exile; who had ſhared all her joys, and all her ſorrows, was now with the Counteſs; and JULIA a priſoner alone, and wretched, friendleſs and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn; far from the ſoothings of friendſhip, and diſtant from the cheerful voice of thoſe ſhe loved; in the power of a man, who poſſeſſed wealth and honour, and who was unprincipled, and wicked to the laſt degree of vice.</p>
               <p>She aroſe and ſurveyed her chamber. It was large, and furniſhed with crimſon velvet, fringed with gold; but ſo old, that it was black and tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; the chairs and toilet were the ſame, as the bed. An high old faſhioned japaned bureau ſtood in one corner; and the floor was covered with India matraſs; the room was hung with tapeſtry, and had once been rich, and beautiful, but its
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:039134_0153_1013B1015698A718"/>
beauty was loſt, to memory; and its value gone forever. The windows were of painted glaſs, and emitted ſo little light, as rather to increaſe, than leſſen the gloom; ſhe looked from them, and found the proſpect extenſive, and delightful; hills, vales, and meadows, crowned with lofty trees, and ſpread with verdant foliage, interſperſed with rivers; the ſtreams of which, were in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces croſſed by bridges, formed at once, a view, grand, noble and majeſtic; and in the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the beauties of nature, her heart aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed ſomething of its uſual tranquillity, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more aſſured, as ſhe looked upon the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous flocks that bleated in the meadows; alas! ſaid ſhe, I am as innocent as they are; why am I not ſo happy? Her reaſon replied, they have not the ſame reflective qualities, they are inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the charms of innocence; and to the blackneſs of vice, ſay, who would barter the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities that refined reaſon poſſeſſes, for the mean ſenſual pleaſures they enjoy; fed, but to be fitted for the knife of the butcher, or rendered delicious, for the table of the voluptuary; they catch the tranſient joy of the moment, nor dream that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow, they ſhall be ſerved up as a feaſt for the hungry, or the glutton, while I, ſaid JULIA, tho' oppreſſed and unhappy, look forward to futurity with hope, and bliſsful certainty.</p>
               <p>The woman, now entered with her breakfaſt, and ſhe eat but little, and endeavoured to enter into converſation with her; it was neither of thoſe ſhe had ſeen the night before; age had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her reſpectable; her hair was white, and time with his relentleſs finger had impreſſed her
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:039134_0154_1013B10437F7D1E0"/>
fore-head with his wrinkles; ſhe was dreſſed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently, and very neat, but not the leaſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of finery. She ſat down the ſalver which ſhe had brought, but did not look JULIA in the face; nor did ſhe ſpeak. JULIA viewed her with attention, and the examination of her features filled her with a pleaſing hope; how long, good woman, ſaid ſhe, have you lived at the chatteau? It is above nineteen years, ſhe replied. I ſhould ſuppoſe then (ſaid JULIA, with a ſigh) you are much attached to the Count? I am attached to my duty, and that leads me to regard the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of my employer. Was you ever in the ſervice of any one elſe, aſked JULIA? I ſerved the good old Marquis, his grandfather, and the preſent wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Marquis, his father, (replied ſhe,) and there love and duty went together. You know the Marquis, then ſaid JULIA? I know him and love him too. But he could not love what was not good, cried the old woman. At that moment ſhe looked in JULIA's face, you look good, ſhe added, but we are often deceived. Do you ſuppoſe me vicious, aſked JULIA? I have no right to ſuppoſe you ſo, ſhe replied, but if you are, as it is ſaid, a kept miſtreſs of the Count, you cannot be much the reverſe. Good heaven, ſaid JULIA, does any one sſuppoſe me ſo; I am innocent, I deteſt the Count, he has baſely forced me from my friends; the Counteſs DE LAUNA is my benefactreſs; he has artfully brought me here. Oh do believe, that I love virtue, and hate vice. I do believe you, ſaid the old woman, for you have not the look of one of thoſe bad women; but I was told you were a miſtreſs he had long kept, and that you
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:039134_0155_1013B105B9C27FC0"/>
were eloping with another man. It is falſe, ſaid JULIA, indeed, it is falſe; I never was the miſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs of any one, and hope I never ſhall be. She then told the honeſt and faithful PHILADA e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of her ſtory, to intereſt and convince her; the kind creature whoſe heart was attuned to the ſoft ſenſation of pity, aſſured JULIA, that ſhe ſhould have every liberty it was in her power to give her, and that ſhe would try to aſſiſt her eſcape; but that ſhe feared would be impoſſible: She perſuaded her to eat; to be cheerful, and told her, that ſhe might range at pleaſure, around all the apartments, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that floor; when JULIA with tears thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her: She looked up in her face; you intereſt me Madamoiſelle, ſaid ſhe, for you look ſo much like my good lady, the Marchioneſs, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help loving you; ſhe then went down, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chamber door unlocked, that ſhe might viſit the others, when her inclination led her.</p>
               <p>It was not long before JULIA, profited by this liberty, for though curioſity was not her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing paſſion; though ſhe knew how to ſuppreſs it, yet ſhe had her ſhare.</p>
               <p>The firſt room ſhe entered, was furniſhed with yellow ſatin, and was freſh and handſome; the ſecond with gilt leather, but neither had any thing to intereſt the heart, or call up any of its better feelings; but the third was wholly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with books and pictures; the window<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curtains were of a dark ſcarlet damaſk, with ſilver fringe; a writing table that had long been unuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſtood in the middle; a large pier glaſs hung between the windows, and the books were arrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon ſhelves, from the floor to the ceiling;
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:039134_0156_1013B1074A5C7740"/>
while the pictures occupied the oppoſite pannels. At the firſt glance, ſhe knew the Counteſs and the Marquis, and her affectionate heart did hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, even to their reſemblance, ſketched upon the ſenſeleſs canvaſs; but her attention was much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſed by one of uncommon beauty, that hung beſide the Marquis. This picture reminded JULIA, of ſome painting, or perſon that ſhe had ſeen before. The drapery was at the ſame time, a combination of ſimplicity and elegance; the charming countenance was lovely, and expreſſive, and her ſoft blue eyes, ſeemed fixt upon thoſe that were viewing them: She held upon her fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers a bird, and the benevolence that was expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in her looks; told the moſt curſory obſerver, that the little flutterer was happy. JULIA con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated this picture for ſome time, ſhe left it, walked to the other ſide of the room, but return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it in a moment; ſhe was drawn, by a power, that ſhe did not fully underſtand; but it was irreſiſtible; while ſhe ſtill gazed upon it, PHILADA entered. I have brought you ſome books, Madamoiſelle, ſaid ſhe, that will I believe, pleaſe you better than thoſe in the library. Have you looked at this picture, Madamoiſelle? JULIA replied, ſhe had; and that ſhe was charmed with it; and it was a very lovely picture. Is the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal alive? Oh no, cried PHILADA, with a deep ſigh; ſhe has been dead for many years; that picture was taken for the Marchioneſs, before ſhe left Italy, and ſent by the Marquis to his ſon. It is the very image of her, ſaid ſhe; juſt ſuch a ſweet ſmile; ſhe always wore juſt ſuch a ſoft look; how often have I ſeen the tears in her
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:039134_0157_1013B10C918E2400"/>
mild eyes, when ſhe ſaw any body unhappy. That picture at the right hand is the Marquis; he ſeems to be looking back upon the other, that was his firſt wife, the Count's mother: She was a pretty creature, but a mere baby, and not to be compared to the other. There Madamoiſelle, is the Count, and Counteſs DE LAUNA, they were a noble couple, and looked as grand and good, as you ſee them there. And who is this, ſaid JULIA, that hangs behind the Counteſs? It is a young Engliſh Lord, (replied PHILADA,) that loved her, and Madam was ſadly in love, with him; they were privately married; but the friends contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to break it off; if has coſt Madam, many a tear. JULIA now examined this picture with a ſcrutiny, that was occaſioned by hearing the Counteſs remark, the reſemblance, between her lover, and COLWORT; ſhe ſaw indeed, a likeneſs, but not the ſtriking one, that ſhe expected; ſhe turned to the portrait, that adorned the other ſide, and enquired who they were? Theſe on the left, ſaid her kind informer, are the old Count and Counteſs; theſe on the right, the old Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis, and his lady. Do Madamoiſelle, look in the glaſs, (added ſhe, as ſhe wiped off the duſt that had gathered upon it, with an handkerchief,) do look in the glaſs, and then look upon this picture, of the young Marchioneſs; and tell me if you do not ſee a likeneſs. I think I do, replied JULIA, after ſhe had for a moment done as ſhe was requeſted; but it is perhaps owing to my vanity. Oh Madamoiſelle, ſaid PHILADA, if you are as much like my lady in action, as you are in looks, you are good indeed; but I hope you will

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he Marchioneſs, very happy. Did not ſhe love the Marquis? Yes, and he loved; and if they had been let alone, they would have been happy until now together. Why ſaid JULIA, aſtoniſhed, what happened to them, and who interfered to prevent their happineſs? Why, Madamoiſelle, the Count hated her; but he fell ſick, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to repent, and ſo the Marquis brought her, to ſee him; would to heaven ſhe had never come. I attended my lady; ſhe had another woman with her, who loved her as well as I did; She had come from Italy, with her lady, and was always near her; but what could we do? But Madamoiſelle, I am telling you things, that does not concern you, and doing very wrong too, I fear. I think not, ſaid JULIA, I beg you would proceed; depend upon it, I will never betray you. I do not know how it is, ſaid PHILADA, but I cannot find it, in my heart, to deny you any thing. Well, as I was ſaying, we came to this chatteau, and the Count got well, but ſlowly; and the Marquis was diſtreſſed, for fear he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a conſumption; and loath to leave him alone a perſuaded the Marchioneſs to lay in here, for the Marquis was obliged to go to Spain; and after he was gone, the Count fell in love with his mother in law; the Marchioneſs was frighted and diſtreſſed, and cried night and day; and wrote to the Marquis, and would never let us be abſent from her for a moment. Well, Madam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oiſelle, the Count was enraged at her refuſal, and vowed he would be revenged, and my lady was ſcared to death, and took to her bed, and at laſt
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:039134_0159_1013B110C8BFE610"/>
was brought to bed of a little daughter; and that very day, the Count was cloſeted with a phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, for ſeveral hours, who left him and went immediately into my lady's apartment, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded her to take an Elixer, as he called it. She was always ſubmiſſive, to other people's will, and did as he deſired her; but ſhe grew worſe, and remembered how the Count had threatened her, and ſhe thought ſhe was dying; ſhe called me to her bed ſide, with ISABELLA. PHILADA ſaid ſhe, tell the Marquiſs I ever loved him, tell him that I fell a ſacrifice to that love; take care of my child; I wiſh the Counteſs DE LAUNA could bring her up; but I charge you both to deliver her to my Lord; ſhe ſaid much more, but I am a weak creature, and went into fits, but my poor lady died that night, and her little daughter died too, and the maid was carried off, for I have never ſeen her ſince; but I believe the Count had her conveyed away, and knew what was become of her. GOD forgive him; I fear I never ſhall. And you think, ſaid JULIA, who had liſtened, with emotion to the artleſs tale of PHILADA; you think the cordial proved fatal to the poor Marchioneſs; why did not you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form againſt the phyſician? Oh yes, ſaid PHILA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DA, it proved fatal; but what could a poor ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant do, againſt a rich and powerful Lord? the Marquis grew diſtracted, the Count DE LAUNA was killed in a duel; and Madam left the world for retirement; ſo that the matter was huſhed up, but I believe the Count ſuffers ſometimes in his own mind, though he does not believe in GOD, or the bible; I know he is afraid of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:039134_0160_1013B1136F7B8868"/>
and I believe he is haunted; with a troubled conſcience, ſaid JULIA; but the pure ſpirit of the amiable Marchioneſs, will never leave the realms of bliſs, to diſturb him; would to heaven I was with her, for I ſhudder to think that I am in the power of a murderer, an atheiſt, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural man; who fears not GOD and believes not in a future ſtate. Do aid me PHILADA; do aſſiſt me to eſcape; and you ſhall never come to any harm by your kindneſs. I will try, Madam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oiſelle, I will do all in my power; but this houſe is ſtrongly ſecured and guarded, and I am watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and am afraid I ſhall not be able to aſſiſt you. Why Madamoiſelle, there has been in the priſon, under the chatteau, perſons confined for years and years together, and I do not know if they are men or women; but three nights ago, they brought another, that was a man; but I do not know who it is. Where are they confined, ſaid JULIA? She anſwered in the priſon, beneath this part of the chatteau; but it is very deep, and a great way off.</p>
               <p>Juſt then, PHILADA was ſummoned to the kitchen, and JULIA was left for the remainder of the day, to indulge the moſt painful apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, for the information ſhe had received, had rendered every idea gloomy, and every thought ſad; how often do we pay this heavy tax, for the indulgence of our curioſity.</p>
               <p>That, and the following day, ſhe did not ſee PHILADA, but on the third morning, that vener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able domeſtic, brought her breakfaſt; ſhe apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logized for not having come before, as ſhe had been buſy in preparing the ſpring feaſt, for the
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:039134_0161_1013B1174FF4ABC8"/>
vaſſals of the Count; and to day Madamoiſelle, ſaid ſhe, I ſhall be fully employed in getting mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to rights, ſo that I ſhall not be able to attend upon you myſelf, until tomorrow; but you look ſad and gloomy, would not a walk do you good; if it is agreeable to you, you can walk upon the terrace that ſurrounds the upper part of this building. Alas! ſaid JULIA, I cannot be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from my melancholy reflections; for I have ſo faint a hope of being freed from the machinations of this dreadful man, that I cannot but be unhappy. But you are very good, PHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LADA; formerly I ſhould have enjoyed the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that I am ſure the terrace affords, and I will go now, as you ſo kindly propoſe it.</p>
               <p>PHILADA looked upon her with pity, as ſhe led the way acroſs the chamber, and up two nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſtaircaſes; ſhe then opened a door, and they were immediately upon the terrace. It would be impoſſible to deſcribe the beauties of the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive view, that were preſented, and JULIA loſt her preſent woes and anticipated evils, in delight and aſtoniſhment; ſhe tarried here for ſeveral hours, and only returned to her chamber at the time PHILADA had requeſted ſhe would receive her dinner; as ſhe was cautious that no one of the ſervants ſhould know, of the liberty ſhe allowed her.</p>
               <p>Her mind had experienced ſome tranquillity, while enjoying the freſh air, and cheering proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect; but when ſhe returned to her own apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the illuſion fled; the bubble was diſſolved, and in ſpite of fancy, ſhe was wretched. After taſting of her ſolitary meal, ſhe opened a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:039134_0162_1013B119F4C76DC8"/>
that lay on the table, and endeavored to read; but the charm that once gave her pleaſure in peruſing the works of genius, was fled; the beauties of poetry, ceaſed to delight; the hiſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic page, to inſtruct; and the fiction of romance, to amuſe; "hope, to borrow the words of an enchanting writer; had ceaſed to illumine the horizon of her proſpects, and dark clouds, and gloomy deſpair, occupied its place."</p>
               <p>In this deſpondent ſituation, ſhe ſpent ſeveral hours; but her chamber was warm, and ſhe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſought the freſh air of the terrace. The ſun which was near ſitting, juſt emerged from a cloud, and its yellow rays, darted with refulgent beauty acroſs the horizon, and ſurrounding hills; the ſoft rain that had juſt fell, had refreſhed the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows; and a gentle fragrance aroſe, like ſmoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incenſe to heaven. At a ſmall diſtance, ſhe beheld ſome fiſhermen, that had drawn their nets to the ſhore; one, had hung the finny fair upon a pole, and thrown it acroſs his ſhoulders; he walked towards his cottage; three children ran out to meet him; his wife ſtood in the door, and by her geſture ſeemed to invite his haſte, to partake of the repaſt, ſhe had prepared. JULIA's fancy followed him in; ſhe ſaw him ſeated; the coarſe, but clean table-cloth; the frugal meal; heard the laugh of the children; and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents of love and welcome from the wife; and formed ſo delightful a picture, that her imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions loved to dwell upon it.</p>
               <p>But the bleating of the flocks, awakened her from the deluſion, and ſhe beheld in reality the freſh and ruddy milk maid, bending beneath her
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:039134_0163_1013B11B772631D0"/>
full pail; while the lowing herd, and fleecy flocks, ſeemed prepared to take that repoſe, which indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent nature, allows to weary man; to all, but me, ſaid JULIA, all can repoſe; but alas! for me, far from thoſe I love; the ſweets of ſlumber are denied me, and I have not one viſion, that can lull me to repoſe, not a thought that can comfort me waking, or one idea, that can ſuggeſt an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable dream.</p>
               <p>While ſhe leaned againſt one of the battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſhe indulged theſe deſponding ſuggeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but before ſhe had purſued them long; her attention was arouſed by the opening of a door; looking around, ſhe ſaw a female that had juſt entered the terrace; her form was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtic; her motion ſlow, but graceful; and her dreſs was of the fineſt muſlin, which floated in the wind; her back was towards JULIA; ſhe obſerved that her ſteps were weak, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling; and that as ſhe walked ſhe held by the baniſters; ſhe walked away, and JULIA longed to ſee her face; felt all the force of curioſity, mingled with ſurpriſe; ſhe would have followed her, but feared ſuch a conduct, might be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, and obtruſive; it was not five minutes before ſhe returned; and looking at JULIA, claſped her hands, and raiſed her eyes, as aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed and affrighted.</p>
               <p>Oh Heaven! exclaimed ſhe, it is my ſiſter; my bleſſed, beautiful ſiſter; come from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of angels; from the ſociety of ſaints, from worlds of purity and joy. Oh, tell me, tell thy miſerable LEONORA; when ſhall I be freed from theſe fetters? when freed from a ſenſe of guilt?
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:039134_0164_1013B11F82DD13F8"/>
when will my crimes be blotted out? when ſhall I be at peace? Alas! ſaid JULIA, I am a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and a poor unhappy creature. Unhappy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied ſhe; have you broke your vows? are you guilty? No, ſaid JULIA, I am innocent of any great crime; yet I am miſerable. Miſery is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for the guilty, replied ſhe wildly; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent have no claim to it. If indeed you have broken no vows, if your conſcience is free from ſtain; and you do not look back with horror, upon ſome black tranſgreſſion, you are happy. The wildneſs of her fine eyes; the paleneſs of her face; her cheeks faded; her forehead denſe; and her once beautiful noſe pinched by the hand of ſickneſs; ſhewed indeed the ſad, the ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful picture of beauty in ruins; and thoſe ruins brought on, by the ſtings of a wounded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; and an heart corroded by guilt. JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIA gazed on her with aſtoniſhment, and with pity; ſhe was ſilent, and JULIA replied; but I have been forced from the friends I loved, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of my liberty; a priſoner within theſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted walls; and in the power of a baſe, unprinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled man; do you wonder that I am unhappy? I, ſaid the ſtranger, have no friends; no fortune; I have loſt my health; my title to the eſteem of the worthy; to the prayers of the virtuous; fled from my country; forſaken by the man I dared to love; who was the occaſion of all my woes; I have broken my vows; vows too the moſt ſolemn; the moſt ſacred, which any one but an impious wretch, would have reſpected, and loſt inevitably loſt my peace of mind. Good heaven, ſaid JULIA, what a catalogue of evils; let me
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:039134_0165_1013B1210760D6F8"/>
ſympathiſe with you, and I will forget my own ſorrows, to mitigate your's. "Will that reſtore my honor; my fame? will that ſtand between me, and divine juſtice? will that compenſate for the evils I have done to ſociety? Oh no; I am not to be trifled with; if indeed you are my ſiſter, tell me ſo; and ſay, die LEONORA! and be at reſt." Oh, ſaid JULIA, I have no ſiſter; I never knew ſuch happineſs. "Well then, (replied the ſtranger,) while a heavy ſigh ſeemed to rend her heart! but I ſhall die; and ſhortly be laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the clods of the valley; or confined with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the dark and narrow limits of the tomb." As ſhe ſpoke, ſhe faultered; a ſlight convulſion croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her countenance; and but for JULIA, ſhe muſt have fallen.</p>
               <p>At that moment an attendant entered. Good heaven! SIGNORA, ſaid ſhe, we have been diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for you, but you are ill, and weak. Let me aſſiſt you to your chamber; ſhe then called up another female ſervant, and with great tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and reſpect, perſuaded her to return. Lift me up, ſaid ſhe, I would once more look towards England. JULIA aſſiſted the women to raiſe her, ſhe looked to that part of the horizon, that pointed to the Britiſh ſhores, and for a moment ſeemed loſt in thought. Alas! (ſhe cried, with a mournful accent,) alas! he dies there, the victim of his own perfidy, and falſehood; but the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is not completely made; but one victim has fallen; another remains, and that ſoon will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat it; but GOD forgive him; I will go pray for his repoſe. She then leaned upon her domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, and left the terrace.</p>

               <p>JULIA's pity and wonder prevented her fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſo ſad a ſpectacle, and by dividing her concern, leſſened it. She found herſelf innocent, and in full poſſeſſion of her reaſon, and ſhe bent with humble gratitude to heaven, for both theſe bleſſings. She prayed for their continuance; ſhe prayed too, for the poor unfortunate, ſhe had ſeen; ſhe aſked the protection of that power, who is the guardian of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>; and let it not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct from her ſenſibility, when we ſay ſhe was calmer, and ſlept better than ſhe had for ſeveral nights.</p>
               <p>She awoke with the earlieſt rays of the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and was not entirely dreſſed, when PHILADA entered, with one of the young women ſhe had ſeen the day before upon the terrace. "I am ſorry, Madamoiſelle, (ſaid PHILADA,) that you met the SIGNORA yeſterday evening, ſhe has been ſadly affrighted all night; and tells her attendants, ſhe has ſeen her ſiſter's apparition; IRESILLA, who waits upon her, has come to requeſt you will viſit her in her own apartment, as ſhe is too low to leave her bed." JULIA replied, ſhe would go moſt willingly. Will you, Madamoiſelle, be ſo good as to promiſe me, not to mention the Count, if you ſhould, it will bring me into great trouble?
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:039134_0167_1013B125332C1130"/>
Certainly (ſaid JULIA,) I will never ſay any thing, that can injure you.</p>
               <p>They then conducted JULIA acroſs ſeveral a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments; till they opened a door that led to the ſouth wing of the building; two chambers in this ſuite were furniſhed in quite a modern ſtile; and were much larger than any ſhe had ſeen; the third was the bed chamber of the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate LEONORA. Upon a bed of yellow ſilk was laid this woman once ſo lovely; always ſo unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate; her emaciated arm, was out ſide the counterpane, while one hand was under her pale and faded cheek; the young lady you wiſhed ſo much to ſee, is here (ſaid IRESILLA.) JULIA approached the bed, and in gentle accents expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her ſorrow for the ſtate ſhe ſaw her in. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me, this trouble, lady, ſaid the dying peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; my imagination miſled me; I thought you were my ſiſter; my faithful attendants were ſorry to ſee me ſo miſtaken; and you have kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condeſcended to undeceive me; ſet down, and if you can bear a ſick chamber, and ſpare me a few moments your company, I think it will ſooth me. JULIA, ſeated herſelf; ſhe aſſured her, it would give her pleaſure to ſpend ſome hours with her; and PHILADA withdrew, ſaying ſhe would return by noon; ſhe then inquired of JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIA, if ſhe was of that country? I am a native of France, Madam, (ſaid JULIA.) You are young and lovely, returned the ſick lady; but I fear you are not happy. "Indeed, replied JULIA, I am very far from being happy. I do not aſk the ſource of your misfortunes, rejoined the lady; for I am too ill to converſe or attend; I muſt adviſe you to keep a quiet conſcience; do not, for a
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:039134_0168_1013B12A631195B8"/>
temporary pleaſure, however flattering, involve yourſelf in guilt; do not for one moment ſuffer yourſelf to think of happineſs, unattended by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence; be aſſured that it never was attained; be aſſured likewiſe, that you cannot long be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable, while you preſerve a conſciouſneſs of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done your duty; of having acted upright; and preſerving your honor; if afflictions crowd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round you; if you are tempted to deſpond by their weight, and numbers; put your truſt in him who has the peculiar care of innocence; be aſſured the clouds will diſperſe, and he will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for your relief; for me, I have forfeited his love; but I have a ſtrong hold upon his mercy; and though I have lived ſeventeen years, deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and miſerable, yet I die calm, ſatiſfied, and compoſed. For your inſtruction, I will preſent you with a manuſcript; it is a ſad, but faithful narrative of my tranſgreſſion, and its attendant woes; while you read it, you will condemn me; it is your duty to do ſo; but recollect the ſtate, to which you have ſeen me reduced, and ſhed a tear of ſympathy, for my failings, and my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes."</p>
               <p>"She then bid IRESILLA hand a caſket, and unlock it; here, (ſaid ſhe) is the manuſcript; and with it, I beg you will accept of this picture; it is the miniature of my ſiſter, whom you ſo much reſemble; keep it for my ſake, and poſſeſs the virtue, ſhe inherited, and you will be good indeed."</p>
               <p>JULIA had been too much affected to anſwer; ſhe could now only preſs the cold hand of LEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NORA, to her lips, ſhe placed the picture in her boſom; and after ſome time, thanked her for her bequeſt, which ſhe aſſured her ſhould have
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:039134_0169_1013B12D233DAEC8"/>
an happy effect. If ever you are tempted to ſwerve from the paths of virtue, (ſaid LEONORA) read that paper, and while you read it; remember you have ſeen the wretched writer, deprived of thoſe charms which rendered her an object of affection, upon the bed of death; deprived too, by the man who loved her, of that which alone could render her an object of eſteem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to this ſad, this deplorable condition we all muſt come; but it lays in the boſom of all, to render the hour of death, happy or miſerable. Had I endured all the auſterities of a convent; nobly combatted an illegal paſſion; and kept my faith unbroken; my temptations would now be a cauſe of triumph to me; and in joy, I ſhould now leave a world, whoſe vanity had failed to allure me; whoſe vices had tempted me in vain; and in whoſe wickedneſs I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhared. But now I ſhrink from the conflict; I am fearful of offended juſtice; and reſt only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on forgiving mercy. As ſhe pronounced the laſt words, ſhe ſunk back upon the pillow, faint and exhauſted. JULIA wiped the cold damps from her face; ſhe endeavored to aſſure her faith, with the promiſes of mercy, and forgiveneſs; of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love and conſolation; and with one of her cold hands in her's, ſet by the bed, while ſhe ſlept.</p>
               <p>To have beheld an object the moſt indifferent approaching its exit; ſtruggling with the laſt ſymptoms of a ſlow diſeaſe; combatting with the grim tyrant without a friend; without ſtrength; without ſpirits; her heart would have melted with ſympathy, and ſhe would have felt the ſenſations of pity; but when ſhe beheld a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſenſible, intereſting, and lovely; reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:039134_0170_1013B12EA6070028"/>
by misfortune, and acknowledged guilt; Pale, faded, wan, and afflicted; without a friend or relation to ſoothe; attended by ſervants; ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling to ſuppreſs her laſt ſigh; while ſhe heard her in a ſoft, trembling, and pathetic voice, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting her to perſevere in the paths ſhe herſelf had forſaken; while the laſt breath was hover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon her lips, inculcating the leſſons of truth, and virtue; with an energy that exhauſted her, and a pathos that almoſt wore her out; She gave a looſe to her feelings, and her tears flowed without control.</p>
               <p>It was near noon, when LEONORA awoke; but ſo very weak, that ſhe could not ſpeak; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in a whiſper; after taking a cordial, ſhe ſeemed inclined again to ſleep, and PHILADA entering, requeſted JULIA, to return to her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; ſhe kiſſed the cheek of the dying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> LEONO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RA; promiſed to viſit her the next day, and left her. As ſoon as ſhe got to her chamber and had diſmiſſed PHILADA, ſhe opened the paper, and read the following ſtory of that unfortunate wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
               <p>"It is unneceſſary to ſay, I am of a noble family, ſince the late beautiful and amiable Marchioneſs of Alvada was my ſiſter; born in Italy, and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in a convent; the darling of a fond mother who loved her children ſo well, as to ſpend moſt of her time with us; my heart never ſwerved from the rules of virtue; and honor was to me dearer than life. It was my bittereſt miſfortune in early youth, to loſe this beſt of mothers. After her death, I ſpent ſome time with my father; and there became acquainted with an old noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who wiſhed to marry me; my father flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:039134_0171_1013B1315068E1C8"/>
with the propoſed connection, preſſed my acceptance; but I refuſed; he then offered me the choice of a nunnery for life, or marriage with the Duke. I had no alternative, and I did not heſitate; I embraced the latter; and with a holy zeal, immediately took the veil; and with all the enthuſiaſm of miſplaced piety, performed all the duty of my ſtation; and became an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to my ſiſter nuns, and gained the love and admiration of the ſuperiors. For ſeveral years I was happy; but I loſt my father; my ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter married, and left Italy; my attachments to the world were leſſened; my love to it abated; and I was ſuperſtitiouſly attached to my convent, and my religion. I ſhed but few tears when my ſiſter died, though ſhe was the deareſt object of my earthly affection; and deſerved the love of all; but alas! my ſorrows were then near commenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and it was time for me to bid adieu, to all tranquillity.</p>
               <p>It was at a proceſſion, at which, the duties of my ſtation obliged me to make a public appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; I ſaw and was ſeen by an Engliſh noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; the moment his eyes met mine, I imbibed that fatal paſſion, that has ſince proved the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction of my happineſs: whenever he paſſed me, his looks declared that our ſenſations were mutual; and I retired to my cell, confuſed, ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated and wretched: I could not read; I could not pray; my mind burſt the walls of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent; and my imagination conveyed me to the man who had cauſed ſuch anxiety; three days after I received a letter from him; it was filled with profeſſions of tenderneſs, and love; a correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence enſued, for I had no power to reſiſt his
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:039134_0172_1013B13521B1CB20"/>
arts; and fell into the deluſion, that ſhut my eyes upon truth and its dictates. I ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to recount the various methods he uſed; nor the gradations, by which I loſt a ſenſe of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: I vainly thought that I could reconcile a breach of my moſt ſolemn vows; pledged upon the ſacred altar to the moſt high, with honor and with love; and at laſt was ſo infatuated, as to conſent to eſcape from my convent, and go to England, upon his promiſe that he would ſend ſome one, in whom he could confide, to meet me at Bruſſels, and conduct me to London; where I ſhould be introduced to him in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his mother and family, and that the holy prieſt ſhould be in waiting, and the day of my arrival ſhould make me his wife.</p>
               <p>His word once pledged, I dreamt not that he could break it; nor did I once think, I had ſet him an example, that he would follow: I was infatuated by a blind paſſion, that triumphed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver truth, and religion; that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>et death, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at defiance; for I riſqued my life, by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my vows; and ran vaſt hazard and danger by making my eſcape.</p>
               <p>But I ſurmounted every difficulty, and got the better of every fear; and with two faithful domeſtics, left my convent; and arrived at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; hitherto his promiſes had been punctually fulfilled. I had been met as he had appointed; and attended with the utmoſt reſpect; but the moment I arrived, he ſuppoſed me in his power, and though he did not throw aſide the maſk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely: I found myſelf diſappointed; inſtead of being conducted to his mother, and met by his relations, I was informed his venerable parent was
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:039134_0173_1013B136A3442ED8"/>
ſo ill, as to preclude the poſſibility of my being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced to her; and that of conſequence, my nuptials muſt be delayed.</p>
               <p>I entertained no ſuſpicion; but my regard to my honor, bid me abſolutely refuſe to ſee my lover, until I could be acknowledged as his wife, before all his connections; and though I made as great a ſacrifice to reputation, as ever was made, I obeyed the dictates of honor; in the interval, which I was perſuaded to believe would be ſhort, I endeavored to perfect myſelf in the Engliſh language; my wiſhes, my ardent wiſhes to pleaſe the man I conſidered as my huſband, were ſuch a ſtimulus to my exertion, that I became a profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and in a very ſhort time I was able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe in the language that I loved, in preference to any other, merely becauſe it was the language of the man I loved.</p>
               <p>I wiſhed to prove myſelf worthy his choice; to gain the eſteem of his friends; particularly of his mother, who I found was conſidered as the beſt of women; and I was ardent in the purſuit of every praiſeworthy accompliſhment.</p>
               <p>The perſon whom he employed, as my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructor, was not a common teacher, but a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman and an intimate friend of Lord B—. I was pleaſed with his ſociety, ſeparately from the benefit I derived from his leſſons; for he talked of my lover; extolled his virtues; and painted him as free from even the frailties of mortality; he accompanied me to public places; gave me all the information I thought neceſſary; and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced me to many perſons, whom he ſaid were the friends of Lord B—, but though the ſcenes I now frequented, were gay, feſtive, and new;
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:039134_0174_1013B13967FB4E48"/>
calculated to faſcinate the heart, inflate the imagination, and miſlead the underſtanding; yet I at laſt ſaw through the veil that hid the truth from my eyes; my ſuſpicions were firſt arouſed, by obſerving all the leſſons that my inſtructor gave me, were calculated to inflame the paſſions, to ſet vice in a fair point of view; to throw a ſhade upon virtue, honor, and religion; at laſt he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo bold, as to declare a preference to illicit love, rather than an honorable attachment and holy marriage.</p>
               <p>My temper, naturally warm, was raiſed; I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid him my preſence; and wrote my lover, to require an explanation of his conduct; and a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect avowal of his deſigns; before I received his anſwer, I was informed that I had been conſidered as an infamous woman; as a kept miſtreſs of his lordſhip; that the perſons to whom I had been introduced were of ſuſpicious characters.</p>
               <p>Good GOD, what were my ſenſations, at this information; I even now ſhudder to reflect upon the horror of my mind; I was every thing but diſtracted.</p>
               <p>When I received Lord B—'s letter, my eyes were intirely opened, and he ſtood confeſſed the villain, he had the audacity to avow his deſigns and with the moſt ſpecious arguments, he woed me to vice and folly; but why ſhould I enlarge upon ſo degrading a propoſal; my paſſions were exhauſted by their own violence; and I became ſo calm as to write him; I did not upbraid him, but I bid him adieu forever; I likewiſe wrote his mother, his venerable mother; I incloſed all the letters that had paſſed between her ſon and myſelf; I gave her a minute detail of my family, and likewiſe
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:039134_0175_1013B13C573C7C80"/>
of the arts that had been uſed to ſeduce me from my country; I ſtayed not for an anſwer; but by the aſſiſtance of a countryman, who had been my friend from my firſt arrival, I ſet out for Italy, and left my unhappy followers in his care; for had they returned, their lives were forfeited by law for having aided a nun, to eſcape from her convent.</p>
               <p>But for the humanity of this gentleman, I ſhould have gone directly back to my convent, and received the puniſhment that I deſerved, a ſevere puniſhment; a lingering and cruel death; but his perſuaſions prevailed, and I was admitted into another nunnery, as a penſioner; the little property that I had been able to take with me, I had divided between my ſervants; what I left behind, became the property of the convent; ſo that I was entirely deſtitute, and but for this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous man, muſt have been indebted to ſtrangers; and while he lived, he paid my board; but in five years, this worthy friend paid the great debt of nature, and fell a ſacrifice to the king of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and I was again deſtitute.</p>
               <p>But I was reſigned to my fate, and performed ſome of the meaneſt offices of the nunnery, for my ſupport.</p>
               <p>The Marquis ALVADA, heard of my ſituation, and offered me an aſylum at this place; I accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his generous offer, and found every thing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for my reception, that could render life bearable: But alas! how vain for a guilty mind, to ſeek for peace, how vain the care of friendſhip! the pomp of wealth! the eaſe of affluence! or the aſſiduity of the worthy!</p>
               <p>Until now, I had only ſuffered the pangs of
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:039134_0176_1013B13F323F2CA8"/>
diſappointed love; I had almoſt forgot my own crimes and the crimes of Lord B—, and when I heard he had put a period to his life; for he could not live without the woman he had ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured; I lamented him with tears of anguiſh! I accuſed my ſate of cruelty; I ſpurned againſt the Divine decrees, and murmured at the will of Heaven; my days were paſſed in ſorrow, and my nights in lamentation; but now that I had no employment, that every thing was provided for me; that no tongue accuſed me; that no voice condemned; now that I became the object of ſympathy, I had leiſure to look into my heart; I accuſed and condemned myſelf; my conſcience bore witneſs againſt me; my guilt ſtared me in the face; my broken vows aroſe in judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me; I endeavored in vain to forget my trangreſſions; I changed my name; I charged my attendants, never to mention it, or ought that could ſuggeſt one diſtreſſing idea.</p>
               <p>But my endeavors were fruitleſs; my reaſon and my miſery could not exiſt together; as there was no remedy for the latter, the former fell a ſacrifice; and for ſeveral years, I was a confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed maniac; at length I grew better; my reaſon was in ſome meaſure reſtored; and my recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, my painful recollection returned; but my health has gradually decayed, and I am now in the laſt ſtages of a conſumption; and ſo grievous are my ſelf-reflections; ſo acute the accuſations of my own conſcience; that at ſome periods I am not myſelf, but a poor diſtracted creature.</p>
               <p>I have until late only contemplated, and that with fear and trembling, the juſtice of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty;
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:039134_0177_1013B1430D91F7F0"/>
I have dreaded his vengeance, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precated his anger; but within a few weeks, the cloud ſeems to diſſipate, and I look forward to divine mercy, with a hope, that I would not barter for worlds; while that agreeable viſion floats upon my imagination; I am calm and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied; but ſometimes deſpair with all its black attendants haunts me; then my ſhattered reaſon is too weak for the conflict, and flies before it; but I bleſs GOD, that theſe dreadful fits are leſs frequent, as I approach my end; and I look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the tomb as the only refuge for the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable; as the ſafe and certain portal to everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bliſs. If this manuſcript ſhould fall into the hands of any one, who ſhould think my ſad ſtory worth reading, let them take warning by my fate, avoid my guilt, pity my weakneſs, and forgive my errors.</p>

               <p>JULIA wept over the above narrative, and found it to be the very ſtory that ROUSSEAU with his pen of fire tranſlated from the original language, and gave to the world as his laſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction; the letters of an Italian nun and an Engliſh nobleman; ſhe remembered that the Counteſs DE LAUNA had told her, the correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was original, and that the facts had come within her own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Her reflections were ſuch as may be imagined; ſhe ſaw more to pity than blame; ſhe ſighed at the frailty of human nature; and endeavored to forget her errors, in the contemplation of her ſufferings, and the recollection of her virtues.</p>
               <p>The next morning ſhe renewed her viſit, and found this unfortunate woman juſt breathing her laſt; as ſhe could not whiſper conſolation to her departing ſpirit, for ſhe lay ſenſeleſs, ſhe quitted the room in a ſtate of mind, eaſier to be conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than deſcribed; in leſs than an hour PHILA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DA came up, and informed her the laſt ſigh was over, and that the ſoul was freed from its clayey tenement, and emancipated from ſin and guilt. She likewiſe informed JULIA that as many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons would be naturally about the houſe, for ſome days, that her walks upon the terrace, and
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:039134_0179_1013B148A7B35868"/>
in the adjoining rooms, muſt be abridged, as ſhe might become the object of ſuſpicion.</p>
               <p>JULIA was grieved at this prohibition, but ſubmitted to it in ſilence; two gloomy days were paſſed in ſad reflection upon the fate of LEONORA, intermixed with anxiety for her own; ſhe ſaw no one, but PHILADA, who told her that the Marquis and Count had expected to hear of the death of LEONORA for ſeveral weeks, and had ſeveral days previous to that event, ſent down their directions, by a confidential ſervant of the Count's, as a ſpy, ſhe ſuppoſed upon her, which had obliged her to abridge her liberty.</p>
               <p>JULIA now learned that the funeral of LEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NORA, was to be the following day, and that her remains were to be interred in the tomb, that ſhe could ſee from her window, and was but a few paces from the Chatteau; ſhe was not ſorry, that ſhe could have an opportunity of ſeeing the laſt reſpect that was paid her, and when ſhe beheld the funeral proceſſion begin to move; beheld the coffin ſupported by ſix men, and followed by all the ſervants and dependants of this domain; as ſhe looked upon it and reflected, that in that ſmall and narrow compaſs, were contained every thing, that remained of LEONORA; whoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged ſoul and generous heart, enlightened by love, and dictated by a noble confidence, had found a convent too ſmall to contain her; who had with hurried ſteps and a throbbing heart, travelled from one kingdom, to another, was now going peaceably, and privately, inſenſible to that domain, whoſe doors would ſoon cloſe upon her forever.</p>
               <p>When ſhe ſaw her followed by a train of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:039134_0180_1013B14B7A960430"/>
peaſantry, without friend or relation, ſhe could not help looking back to the hours when ſhe and her ſiſters, were nurſed by the affection of her fond parents, in the very boſom of elegance, eaſe and affluence; when their wiſhes were prevented by fruition; when every attention was paid to their education; ſhe thought of the hope then entertained; and ſighed to reflect upon their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed hopes, unhappy life, and untimely end: Oh! Said ſhe, could they have looked forward, and ſeen them thus blaſted, how wretched it would have made their lives; how would it have added ſtings, even to the pangs of death. What a moral may be drawn from the fate of theſe love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, unfortunate women; how little does the fond parent know, while triumphing in the ripening beauties of a ſmiling infant offspring; for what they are preſerved; Oh added ſhe, recurring to her own ſad, deſolate ſtate; could mine, though poor and humble, have known to what a ſituation their JULIA would be left, and to what dangers expoſed, they would have wiſhed themſelves childleſs.</p>
               <p>As ſhe purſued theſe melancholy reflections, the proceſſion arrived at the place of its deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the coffin was carried in; the bearers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from the tomb; and its ponderous jaws, were cloſed upon the remains of LEONORA.</p>
               <p>JULIA had a ſtrange curioſity, to viſit the tomb; ſhe had never ſeen one; a pre-ſentiment told her ſhe ſhould reſt in that; and ſhe had this ſtrange wiſh ſo much at heart, that when PHILADA, brought up her ſupper, ſhe mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to her; I have a great curioſity, PHILADA, ſaid ſhe, could not you contrive to gratify it.—
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:039134_0181_1013B14E437F10B8"/>
LORD bleſs you Madamoiſelle, what a ſtrange requeſt, you make; I would not go into it for the world. Well, ſaid JULIA, let me go in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and do you keep watch without. Ah, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoiſelle, if once I did that, you would never return to the Chatteau, and I and mine ſhould be undone forever. No PHILADA, cried JULIA, I ſhould ſcorn a conduct like that; I wiſh to leave this place, indeed; but I would rather run every riſque of threatened danger, and at laſt die in it; than involve any one in ruin, or do a thing, that would bring any bad conſequences upon you; only let me viſit that tomb, and I promiſe you upon my honor that I will return. I ſhould be glad to oblige you, ſaid PHILADA, but I could not open it, to ſave both our lives; my ſon has the key, and could not go in the day time; and LORD have mercy upon us; who would go to viſit the dead at night? That would be the very time, I ſhould like to go; your ſon has the key; I am ſure he will go with us. Here PHILADA, give your ſon this guinea, and aſk him to go with us to night. No, I thank you, Madamoiſelle, LORD bleſs you, what go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſepulchre, the very night after a dead body was put into it; why I ſhould think, I ſaw the Seignora's ghoſt all the time. Indeed PHILADA, ſaid JULIA, there is no ſuch thing as a ghoſt.—But i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> you are reluctant to night, let it be tomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row night; ſpeak of it to your ſon; conſult with him reſpecting it; he will go with me, if you are unwilling. Well, Madamoiſelle, I will think of it; but I do not think it will ever do. JULIA, thus encouraged; made her take the money, and the moſt diſagreeable viſions floated upon her fancy till morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="unknown:039134_0182_1013B14FC5546910"/>
It was early when PHILADA came to her chamber; well PHILADA, ſaid JULIA, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhe ſaw her, what does your ſon ſay to the requeſt I made you? Have you ſeen him? I have, returned PHILADA, and he is ready to obey you; but I am afraid to venture. Of what can you be afraid? diſmiſs it, I beg of you, and this once oblige me. Why Madamoiſelle, ſaid PHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LADA, the good Marchioneſs, that I loved ſo well, lays there; the laſt time I was inſide that tomb, was to ſee her placed there, and my heart trembles within me, when I think of going again, but you are ſo much like her, and ſo urgent, that I will go with you; only you ſhall promiſe not to attempt to eſcape from me. I do promiſe, ſaid JULIA, I will not leave you; even if an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity ſhould offer; I will return back, to my chamber.</p>
               <p>PHILADA then agreed to call upon her at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven, and that her ſon ſhould be waiting for them, at the garden gate.</p>
               <p>All day Julia ſpent in anticipating the viſit of the night, and though ſome chilling reflections came over her, yet her heart did not miſgive her; when ſhe thought of entering the receptacle of the dead; and when it began to grow dark, ſhe waited with extreme impatience, though indeed it was mingled with fear, for the ſtriking of the clock. It had but juſt announced the hour, when PHILADA, faithful to her promiſe, knocked at the door, ſhe entered with, it is ſo ſtormy Madam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oiſelle, that I was thinking you had better not go, to night. Julia aſſured her that ſhe did not value the ſtorm, and obſerved they ſhould be leſs likely to be ſeen.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="unknown:039134_0183_1013B1529C25BFE0"/>
When Philada found her determined, ſhe deſired her to follow her; we muſt ſaid ſhe, go through the Seignora's apartments; her attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants have left the Chatteau, to day, and we ſhall run leſs riſque of a diſcovery; PHILADA led the way, and Julia followed; they paſſed thro' the chamber, in which ſhe had viſited the late inhabitant, when dying; as ſhe went by the bed, ſhe ſhuddered, and PHILADA trembled ſo, that ſhe could ſcarcely ſtand; ſhe took hold of Julia's arm involuntarily, and went on; when arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the bottom of the ſtaircaſe, ſhe left the candle and took a ſmall lantern, that was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready lighted; I think, Madamoiſelle, ſaid ſhe, in a whiſper, you had better take the candle; this gives but a dim light; and if the candle is put out, by the wind, we can light it again, for it is very dark, where we are going. Julia did as ſhe was requeſted, and immediately the great door, that led into the court yard, was opened; as ſhe had not felt the freſh air for a week, tho' the howling of a thunder ſtorm ſtruck her ears, yet it was not wholly unpleaſant to her; the walls were high, and almoſt ſurrounded by different buildings, ſo that in croſſing the court, ſhe felt no inconvenience from it, and indeed ſhe paid no attention to it. But when they came to a little gate, at the further end, it blew full in their faces, and in a moment extinguiſhed the candle ſhe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in her hand; the lantern of Philada only gave light enough to render the darkneſs viſible; it could hardly be called a guide; ſhe now gave it to Jaques, and by the advice of Julia took hold of his arm. I thought as how, ſaid Jaques, that you were not coming. Philada replied,
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:039134_0184_1013B15588F37548"/>
ſhe had done all ſhe could to perſuade Julia out of the notion of it, but finding her ſo bent upon it, ſhe had come with her; juſt at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant a violent clap of thunder, ſeemed to ſhake the firmament; Philada exclaimed, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia endeavored to aſſuage her fears; a violent flaſh of lightning followed, and the hail and rain were driven by the wind full upon them. LORD have mercy, ſaid Philada, if I ever get back to the Chatteau alive again, you will never catch me outſide the doors at night. Certainly, ſaid Julia, we are as ſafe here, as in the Chatteau, not quite ſo comfortable perhaps; but it will be but a few minutes, and I do not mind it at all. Nor I, ſaid Jaques; I wiſh mother was not quite ſo fraid. I cannot help it, ſaid Philada; Oh mercy, what a clap was there! Dear PHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lada, cried Julia, do not be ſo alarmed, we are as perfectly ſafe here, as we could be in our cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; every flaſh is commiſſioned by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and it cannot harm us, except by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs command. But, replied Philada, we have no buſineſs here, ſearching tombs in the night; and I am ſure no good can come of it. The young woman has paid me well, mother, ſaid Jaques; and I will ſearch the tombs every night, for the next year, for a good Engliſh guinea; it is my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and I am no more afraid, than I ſhould be at home in my bed. By this time, directed by the faint light, and white pailing, they arrived at the tomb, Jaques applied the key to the door, and with an harſh grating ſound it opened.—When Julia looked into this manſion of death, a kind of chilling horror, ſeemed to pervade her whole frame, and congeal her blood; but for
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:039134_0185_1013B1596F7DDA28"/>
ſhame, ſhe would have turned back; but ſhe ventured in, and Philada holding by the arm of her ſon, followed. Jaques was quite undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Julia with a trembling hand, lit the candle, it was large, and wax, and the bright light of that added to the glare of the lantern, which was now open, illuminated the tomb ſo that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry object was diſcernable.</p>
               <p>Julia looked in with a mixture of fear, awe, and ſatisfaction; and as ſhe caſt her eyes upon a row of coffins that were placed upon a ſhelf of black marble, heaved one ſigh, for what they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. Philada was ſo much affected, that ſhe ſat down upon a marble that was low, and unoccupied, ſhe held the candle in one hand, and reſting her head upon the other; Jaques offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to tell Julia to whom they all belonged; for though they have been put there before I came to the Chatteau; yet I know them all; for I was employed to keep them all clean and in repair. I will accept your offer, ſaid Julia, and pay you for your trouble; Jaques aſſured her he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready paid, and taking the candle, began to give her the information ſhe wiſhed; thoſe two rich coffins ſo covered with gold, and ſilver, are the old Count and Counteſs de Launa; they are long ſince turned to aſhes; nothing but bones remain; yet ſee how clean and bright they are. Julia viewed them, ſhe read upon the plates that adorned the lids, their names titles, fortunes and virtues. Alas, ſaid Julia, of how little real value is their titles, and eſtates; poſſeſſed by one who diſgraces the one, and diſhonors the other; and their virtues are only owned by diſtant branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of their family; no trace is to be found in their
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:039134_0186_1013B15AF213D300"/>
immediate ſucceſſor, of one virtue; to this we muſt all come, and ſhe turned again to Jaques. This, Madamoiſelle, was the Count De Launa; their ſon, from what I have heard of him, he was good, for he was greatly beloved. This then, ſaid Julia, contains what was once the huſband of my benefactreſs; the man whoſe worth ſhe ſtill reveres; whoſe memory ſhe loves, and whoſe loſs ſhe laments. Her thoughts glanced upon OR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MOND, and ſhe turned to another. This was the mother of my Lord, ſaid Jaques, and theſe little coffins contain ſome children, that belonged to the family; and here is the Seignora that was interred yeſterday, I would not open it Madam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oiſelle, (for ſhe put her hand upon it,) for I am ſure, it is offenſive. Julia withdrew her hand, poor Seignora, ſighed ſhe, at laſt you are at peace; for "here the wicked ceaſe from troubling, and here the weary are at reſt." The laſt tears are wiped from your eyes, you have breathed your laſt ſigh, reaſon no more deſerts you; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of frailty no more afflicts you, your tranſgreſſions are all forgiven, and your wounded boſom healed by the hand of a pitying Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. She turned from this to a coffin that ſtood a little apart from the reſt, it was ſtill covered by a velvet pall, fringed with gold, that ſaid Jaques was the lady that my poor mother laments ſo much; that was the laſt Marchioneſs; (Julia went cloſe to it), I can open it, Madamoiſelle, if you wiſh it. If, cried Julia, the gratification of my curioſity, would not too much affect your mother, I ſhould like to ſee what remains of her. I will ſee her too, ſaid Philada, for I always loved
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:039134_0187_1013B15DA1329C88"/>
her, and am not afraid of her. JULIA was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at PHILADA's reſolution, and offered her arm to aſſiſt her; and JAQUES opened the lid and turned down the rich white ſatin, with which the face was covered, and PHILADA exclaimed, Oh, Madamoiſelle, what a dreadful thing is death, and who would have ſuppoſed this to be my dear lady, and yet, ſaid JULIA, I am ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to find it ſo intire: I thought indeed that laying twenty years, in this damp place, would have deſtroyed every veſtige of a face, and yet ever feature remains, only the tincture of the complexion is changed. I have heard, ſaid JA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUES, that its preſervation is owing, to the rich ſpices and aromatics, that the Count DE LAUNA, had put in the coffin; JULIA now examined it with a kind of intereſted curioſity; look PHILA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DA, ſaid ſhe, the crimping is not out of the lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. That very linen, ſaid PHILADA, I did up, and crimped for her; I mended too a little rend I had made in that rich lace, when I carried it to her; I little thought it would be her burial clothes, I ſhall never forget her manner. PHILADA, ſaid ſhe, you take too much pains; you will wear your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out, with your cares; and then ſhe took ſome nice lawn from her drawer; here, PHILADA, ſaid ſhe, (in a kind gentle voice juſt like your own Madamoiſelle,) have that made up for a holiday ſuit; dear lady, it was the laſt preſent ſhe ever made me; and it is as good as new now. That ribbon too that is about the cap was brought down to ornament her baby linen; I tyed up that bow myſelf, it was a true lover's knot, Madamoiſelle, ſee the coronet is worked in gold upon the ends of it. I have heard, ſaid JULIA, that hair grows
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:039134_0188_1013B1607178B7F8"/>
after people are dead, I think it muſt be the caſe, for ſurely ſuch a quantity would not have been left to ſhade the face; O, ſaid Philada, my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy had a great deal to be ſure, but it has grown; I wiſh, added ſhe, in a trembling voice; I wiſh I had a lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>k of it. Your wiſh can eaſily be grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, for ſurely it ariſes from affection, and muſt be innocent, (ſaid JULIA,) and it cannot be criminal in JULIA, to take off a lock with my ſciſſors. Philada wept as irreſolute; what a dreadful thing, is death ſaid ſhe! I ſhudder at it! and I, ſaid JULIA, regard it as a bleſſing, far from conſidering it a dreadful thing; I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as the only ſolace for affliction, and wiſh that my own aching heart, were forever incloſed within this peaceful manſion; ſhe ſighed deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as ſhe ſpake, and JULIA, propoſed to return to the Chatteau, as they had been abſent near an hour. JULIA produced her ſciſſors, but JAQUES could not uſe them; and anxious to gratify Philada, aſſumed courage to do it herſelf; Jaques took the candle, and Philada held the lanthorn; and JULIA ſtooped to cut off the lock of hair, ſhe looked around the tomb, ſhe aſked her heart if it was ſacrilege, if ſhe was doing wrong? but conſcience anſwered in the negative, and ſhe was proceeding; ſhe had juſt touched the hair, when the ſtillneſs that pervaded the gloomy manſion was interrupted by a deep ſigh; and JULIA ſtarted, touched the face, to her hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror it ſunk into aſhes, and mouldered into duſt; not a feature remained; it was all an horrid chaſm, for the affrighted imagination to fill up. Julia was petrified; don't be ſcared, Madamoiſelle, ſaid Julia, it is only the preſſure of the air, effected it.
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:039134_0189_10136EB3A8134318"/>
Philada turned almoſt fainting from the coffin; and JULIA's trembling and paleneſs, declared her emotion; Jaques pulled up the ſatin covering, but before he could cloſe the lid, ſhe caſt a fearful glance around the tomb, and at a diſtant part of it, thought ſhe diſcovered a man; Philada ſaw it at the ſame time, and the lantern dropped from her hand, ſhe fell almoſt ſenſeleſs to the ground; the ſight JULIA, had witneſſed deprived her of the power of looking, and almoſt of breathing; ſhe ſtooped, but could give no ſuccor to Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da; who in a low and grieved tone of voice, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared ſhe had ſeen a ghoſt; Jaques helped his mother up, and though very courageous, was doubtful as to the nature of what he had ſeen; and aided her out of the tomb; but the inſtant the air met the candle, it was extinguiſhed, the light in the lantern was put out by the fall, and they were now in intire darkneſs, except the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and awful flaſhes of vivid lightning; the thunder too rolled over their heads, the winds howled as anſwering, and the rain beat with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing violence. This war of elements however in ſome meaſure recalled the ſcattered ſenſes of Philada, and ſhe exerted herſelf to walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Jaques, and JULIA; who was more terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied than ſhe had ever been before, yet ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to inſpire Philada, with a preſence of mind, that ſhe herſelf wanted. It was with ſome difficulty they reached the Chatteau, and Jaques helped them to JULIA's room; a candle was burning upon her table, and the moment they entered, Philada ſunk into a chair; and JULIA out of breath with her exertions, and terrified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond her power of expreſſion, ſet down and found
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:039134_0190_1013B165DACC69A0"/>
herſelf unable to move. Jaques went to his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's chamber and returned with a bottle and glaſs, and JULIA readily conſented to drink ſome wine; after Philada had taken a glaſs; they were ſo much refreſhed, that Jaques left them, and in a few minutes Philada declared herſelf unable to get to her own room, and ſaid, for the world ſhe would not lay alone. JULIA readily offered part of her bed, which was accepted with gratitude; but notwithſtanding their clothes were cold, and wet, it was ſome time before they could undreſs. Philada, ſaid JULIA, did you ſuppoſe that any one, but ourſelves was in the tomb. Dear Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoiſelle, there was not any other perſon there, it was an apparition, I ſaw it as well as you, and knew who it was; I have heard the Chatteau was haunted before; but never was ſure of it until now. Who did you ſuppoſe it to be, ſaid JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIA. I cannot think, but it was ſome perſon who followed us into the tomb. Oh, no, no, ſaid Philada, it was no living perſon, it was the Lord HENRY ORMOND, he died ten years ago; that killed the Count DE LAUNA; I am ſure it was he, for I have ſeen him, an hundred times when he was at the Marquis'; he uſed to viſit at the Count's, and I knew him at the firſt ſight of him; why, I looked upon him a minute, before I had ſtrength to fall down. I was ſhocked, ſaid JULIA, at the dreadful change in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs; but I do not think what we ſaw, was any thing ſupernatural; it might be the ſhade of ſomething we had not noticed before; and our imaginations were ſo much affected, that we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it more terrible, than it really was.</p>
               <p>They now went to bed, and notwithſtanding
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:039134_0191_1013B168ADCA7150"/>
her terrors, Philada got to ſleep, long before JULIA; for a very painful idea, was ſuggeſted to her mind, that her fortitude could not overcome, and that ſhe did not chuſe to mention. She thought upon recollection, that the figure ſhe had ſeen reſembled COLWORT; the obſervation Philada had made of it's being young ORMOND, confirmed her in the thought; for the Counteſs had often remarked, that COLWORT, bore a ſtriking likeneſs to her firſt lover. This was the time he was expected in France. She now fanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him dead, and that what ſhe had ſeen was his apparition. Thus ſuperſtition, with all its train of evils, entered a mind, that had hitherto been freed from its influence: but her natural good ſenſe, aided by the books ſhe had read, and the remarks of the which ſhe now recollected, ſoon in ſome meaſure overcome it, and the cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing light of the ſun, which now aroſe in bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt majeſty, helped to diſpel the fears of the night; yet when ſhe reflected upon the gloomy ſcene, and upon the ſudden change of the Marchioneſs; ſhe again experienced her former terrors; and did not wonder that her imagination had become im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated by ſuperſtition; ſhe endeavored to combat her fears, by hopes that COLWORT was ſtill living; and that the Counteſs would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, and reſcue him from the machinations of the Count.</p>

               <p>THE courage of Jaques, his good ſenſe and honeſt open countenance, ſuggeſted to her an idea, that he could aid her eſcape; hope began again to flatter her, and ſhe was impatient, until ſhe could put her plan into execution. She de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired Philada, as ſoon as ſhe awoke from a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed ſleep, to requeſt Jaques to come to her; I want to aſk him ſome queſtions, and have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a favor to aſk him. Philada promiſed to ſend him, but my dear Madamoiſelle, ſaid ſhe, you muſt promiſe me never more to aſk me, to go into a tomb again; ſo do not aſk it; for I never will go. I never will, ſaid JULIA, I paid too dear for the gratification of my curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity laſt night, ever to repeat it. When left alone, her mind again recurred to the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action of the preceding evening; and ſhe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored to think, ſome perſons had watched their motions, and perhaps were hid in the tomb, for the purpoſe of robbing the dead, of ſome of the valuable articles about them; but this thought was ſo much to the diſhonour of her ſpecies, and
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:039134_0193_1013B16F690EE8F8"/>
ſo repugnant to her heart, that ſhe could not give it a moment's continuance. When Philada re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with her breakfaſt, ſhe was ſorry to hear that Jaques, was gone to a village, near three leagues diſtant, and would not return until the following night, as he went upon buſineſs of the ſtewards, which would detain him until that time.</p>
               <p>She felt diſappointed at this intelligence, and the idea of ſpending this day alone in her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, was ſo irkſome to her, that ſhe requeſted Philada, to indulge her, with walking upon the terrace, and the adjoining rooms; this requeſt was granted, and ſhe immediately aſcended the former place, to enjoy the free air, and charming proſpect. She tarried ſeveral hours, and upon her return, viſited the chambers of LEONORA; every thing remained as ſhe had ſeen them, but upon opening a ſmall cloſet, ſhe was gratified to find a ſmall writing deſk, with every material for writing; ſhe did not ſcruple, to take ſome paper, pens, ink and wafers; with theſe, ſhe left theſe melancholy apartments, and returned to her own room.</p>
               <p>She now ſat down, and wrote a letter to the Counteſs; as ſhe did not doubt, ſhe ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail on Jaques, to carry it; this ſeemed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe and employ ſome of her time, and when evening was come, hopes of its ſucceſs had ſhed ſo pleaſing an influence upon her mind, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding her diſagreeable ſituation, ſhe ſlept ſoundly, and awoke refreſhed.</p>
               <p>She found upon enquiries, that Jaques would not be back until night, and Philada promiſed ſhe would bring him up to her, as ſoon as he had
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:039134_0194_1013B1720F1A9B90"/>
delivered his meſſages to the ſteward; ſhe now took a book, and once more aſcended the terrace; but ſhe had not been there long, when lifting up her eyes to behold the beautiful appearance of the ſurrounding hills, ſhe ſaw ſeveral carriages, and men on horſeback; at firſt ſhe thought they were going by; and how ardently did ſhe wiſh ſhe was flying with them, from her hated priſon; but they turned a ſudden angle in the road, and came directly to the Chatteau; in a moment ſhe conceived it was the Count, and his aſſociates, and her trembling limbs could ſcarce ſupport her; ſhe left the terrace, and ſhut herſelf in her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as if ſhe was more ſecure; or that a ſingle bolt could avail any thing againſt her oppreſſor; ſhe went immediately to the window, and there obſerved the carriages enter the Count's yard, and wheel round to the other part of the Chatteau, followed by the Chevaliers on horſeback. She could ſee no more of them; though the noiſe they made at their entrance, ſhe diſtinctly heard.</p>
               <p>When ſhe recollected her own weak defenſeleſs ſtate, and the power and ſtrength of the Count; her confidence forſook her, and her tears flowed apace, until reflection told her, to truſt in him, who is the protector and friend of the orphan, and thoſe who confide in him. She prayed with that genuine piety, which exiſts in the boſom of innocence; and her confidence increaſed; her courage returned; and her calmneſs once more reſumed.</p>
               <p>It was late when Philada entered: Ah! Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoiſelle, ſaid ſhe, I was afraid you would think I had forgot you; but we have had ſo much to do; my Lord is come, with a world of followers;
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:039134_0195_1013B1739339A180"/>
and has ordered ſuch a dinner for tomorrow, that I ſhall have to ſet up half the night, to prepare it. Did he mention me, ſaid JULIA? Philada repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the negative; he has brought a lady, with her woman, and has ordered the Seignora's apartment to be prepared for them, and the adjoining cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for himſelf. Perhaps he is married, ſaid JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIA, and if ſo, how happy ſhall I be? No, ſaid Philada, I inquired, and found ſhe was a kept miſtreſs; ſhe is very handſome, but ſhe looks ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry far from happy. Well, ſaid JULIA, if ſhe only learns him to forget me, I ſhall wiſh her hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; I am ſure, I have had no opportunity to ſpeak to my Lord, nor to come to you; but juſt now before they ſet down to ſupper, the Count had me called to the hall, and told me he wiſhed to ſpeak to me before he went to bed; and bid me wait in his chamber; ſo I thought I would bring up ſomething firſt for you; and then return. Do, ſaid JULIA, let me know, what he ſays to you; I have no inclination to eat, and beg you will carry it down again. Dear Madamoiſelle, you will be ſick, cried Philada, you have eat no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for two days; if you will take the refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I have brought you, I will come up after the Count has diſmiſſed me, and bring up Jaques who got home an hour ago, and is now with the ſteward; but if you will not, I will go to my own room, and not ſee you until the morning. The promiſe and threat prevailed; JULIA aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en her, ſhe would try, and animated with the hope, that Jaques would ſet off with her letter that night; ſhe drank a little wine, and eat ſome of PHILADA's delicacies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="unknown:039134_0196_1013B24EA9969758"/>
It was more than an hour before the honeſt creature returned; ſhe then entered with Jaques. Oh, ſaid JULIA, I am glad to ſee you, but tell me, I beg of you, Philada, what did the Count ſay of me? Why Madamoiſelle, I waited in his chamber for ſome time; at laſt he come. Well, Philada, ſays he, I am glad to ſee you; and want to know what you have done with the young woman I ſent to you. I told him what chamber you were in, and that you took on ſadly, and would not be comforted; he ſaid you were a fool, for that, he did not mean you any harm, and bid me tell you ſo; and that he ſhould viſit you tomorrow; he bid me not to mention you to the ſervants that came with him; or his gueſts, and to caution the domeſtics in the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not too; he then bid me good night, and I called Jaques, and came directly to you.—JULIA, thanked her for her information, and then addreſſed herſelf to Jaques; ſhe offered him her purſe, and all its contents, if he would carry that letter to the Counteſs DE LAUNA; ſhe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him of the protection of that lady, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to him her ſad, defenceleſs ſtate, in ſuch moving terms, that Jaques at length conſented, but he refuſed her money. If the Counteſs will take me into her ſervice, ſaid he, I ſhall be amply rewarded; if not, I ſhall be ruined; but the thoughts of having ſerved you, Madamoiſelle, will reward me; the money will do but little good. JULIA forced upon him as much as would defray his expences; and with a thouſand charges gave him the letter; the honeſt fellow left her with an aſſurance that he would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> that very hour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="unknown:039134_0197_1013B17651251578"/>
It was now near two o'clock, the ill ſhe preſag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Counts viſit; the hopes ſhe conceived from Jaque's honeſty, and expedition, filled her mind, with ſuch a variety of ſenſations, that ſhe felt no wiſh to ſleep; ſhe did not go to bed, but ſat down at the window, and lifting up the ſaſh, explored the expanded firmament; the blue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſe and myriads of ſtars that ſparkled with ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned luſtre; a light vapour had aroſe from the vallies beneath; and ſeemed to ſkim along the ſurface of the plain; and hang on the ſides of the hills; a gentle zephyr whiſpered through the trembling foliage, and juſt moved the tops of the trees, and when towards day, the moon which was in its wane, aroſe in the eaſt, attended by the morning ſtar, ſhe loſt her griefs in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the weather; ſuch an enchanting picture of the grandeur of the works of GOD; and of ſtill life was preſented, as calmed the tumults of her mind, and diſpoſed her to confidence and reſignation; ſhe beheld the approach of morning, with pleaſure; when with a faint light, the eaſtern horizon was tinged; until at length the ſuffuſion of yellow and crimſon was diſplayed, and the ſun emerging from its ſlumbers aroſe, and threw ſuch a blaze of glory, over all nature, as almoſt to dazzle the ſenſes; her reflections were ſo ſoothing, ſo cheering, and agreeable, that recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending herſelf to him who formed the world, who taught the ſun, moon and ſtars, their differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſtations, and all their various, but regular ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olutions; ſhe ſunk into a quiet ſleep, that laſted until Philada made her appearance.</p>
               <p>The kind creature only came with her break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt; for the increaſing cares, and buſineſs of the
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:039134_0198_1013B17A4BBA9428"/>
family claimed her whole time, and attention, and ſhe could only tarry a few minutes.</p>
               <p>Scarcely had ſhe left her, when the footſteps of a man were heard, approaching her door; and in a moment the Count made his appearance; JULIA aroſe, as he entered, and retired involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily to the remote part of the chamber. He approached her with reſpect; good morning, Madamoiſelle, ſaid he, pray take your ſeat, for I have ſomething to ſay, in vindication of my own conduct, that requires your attention. I am ſorry, my Lord, (ſaid JULIA, with ſpirit) that your conduct to me has been of ſuch a nature, as to exclude the poſſibility of a vindication; but you can command my attention, for I am your priſoner. You are no longer ſo (he replied) than you prefer confinement; give me your hand and you are from this moment free, the miſtreſs of my houſe, my heart, my fortune, the ſharer of my titles, my honour; I will preſent you as a daughter to my father; as a niece to my aunt; I ſaw you, and I loved you; unuſed to controul, I could not bear to give you up quietly, and ſee you in poſſeſſion of another; I have been ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in bringing you here, and it now depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on yourſelf, whether you return my affection and become my wife; or obſtinately bent upon your own deſtruction, you refuſe, and are forced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow theſe favours, which I had rather receive as the voluntary offerings of your heart. With my heart, ſaid JULIA, you can have no connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for before I knew your Lordſhip, I had beſtowed that upon another; but leaſt you ſhould miſtake, and ſuppoſe I wiſh to withdraw it, I own to your Lordſhip I never could have loved, or
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:039134_0199_1013B17BCC9DACE0"/>
eſteemed a man, that could act the part you have done; and there is no evil I could encounter ſo great, as a connection with one, whoſe conduct I ſo much and ſo ſeriouſly abhor, as I do yours. She pauſed, but as if amazed at her ſpirit, he did not reply. She proceeded, there is but one way, my Lord, to regain my eſteem, to make me wiſh you well or happy; reſtore me to your aunt; give me my liberty. And do you think (he interrupted) do you think me ſuch an idiot, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the pains I have taken; attached to you as I am, to act ſo inconſiſtent a part; no, I am not ſuch a fool. He was proceeding, when ſhe interrupted him: Suffer me, my Lord, to aſk you one queſtion, (ſaid ſhe,) how can you anſwer your conduct to me; to your conſcience; how can you anſwer to him, who created you; and who can inſtantly bid the vital ſpark that now animates your frame to ceaſe! who with a thought, can deprive you of life, and every thing that renders life dear to you? think my Lord what account you could give, if called upon to give it within a few hours, at that great tribunal, to which you, as well as I, my Lord, muſt appear. You are romantic, cried the Count, and talk of impoſſibilities; you are holding up a mere chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera which has no exiſtence, and cannot affright the truly enlightened mind; it is high time theſe bugbears, the mere tricks of cunning, and artful prieſtcraft, were eraſed from your underſtanding: your mind is enlarged; it is capacious; it is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to theſe notions that you have imbibed from a low and confined education: where is the tribunal you ſpeak of? it exiſts only in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flated imagination of the wild enthuſiaſt; the

very being you adore is imaginary; the future ſtate you threaten, a viſion of the heated brain; or the fiction of religion, to keep the world in awe: I am to myſelf a God, and to my myſelf accountable; I purſue my own pleaſure; if any one ſtands in my way, I put him out of it, with as little concern as I would kick a dog; or cruſh a ſpider; created as much by chance, as the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals he treads upon; man has only a higher rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh for pleaſure, and different views in purſuit, the world is filled with enjoyment, but it is hid from all, except a few, who have become enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, and now no longer afraid; ſeize with avid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity the offered bleſſing; while the vulgar herd are ſtill the ſlaves to ſuperſtition, and prejudice; move on in the ſame dull round, fearful to catch the tranſient pleaſure, leſt future puniſhment ſhould enſue. Are theſe your ſentiments, my Lord, (ſaid JULIA,) I ſhudder at their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and falſity; I no longer wonder at a conduct that has hitherto aſtoniſhed me, and for the honor of human nature I hope and believe you are alone. Your hopes deceive you then, (he replied,) more than twenty thouſand enlightened minds, have already imbibed theſe opinions, and a few years will diſcover them to the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Europe, and the wonder of the world; the temples that are now uſed as the ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The firſt characters in literature, the firſt in philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, have joined themſelves to our ſociety; men of all ranks, and all ages, have embraced our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents; and become bound by our lives; ſome

fair and beautiful women too, whoſe minds are too capacious, to be bound within the narrow, and confined limits that the ſex have been oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to walk by; have thrown off the fetters of preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and advanced within the circle of the illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated; theſe are perſons, whoſe births and fortunes are inferior to none; but diſdaining the ideas of birth and fortune, if you will permit me, I will preſent you to them, a convert, a lovely orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a brilliant ſuperior; for you will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of my dignity, and your own ſhining qualities, will fit you for their ſuperior. Never, my Lord, (ſaid JULIA) never; my ſoul ſhrinks from ſuch a connection; it riſes infinitely above them; the idea will be ſufficiently humiliating, that you have even made the propoſal; I would ſooner become the companion of an honeſt ruſtic, whoſe ſoul was dignified with the idea of immortality; whoſe mind was exalted with the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a GOD, and claimed affinity with angels, than ſtoop to the firſt character in the univerſe, curſed with ſuch degrading ſentiments. What is it that diſtinguiſhes man from the brute crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? It is neither power, wealth or honor, for they are all imaginary; the meaneſt inſect or the filthieſt reptile, has, when GOD permits, power to inflict death, and tortures; the ant and bee, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs wealth equal to all the coffers of the miſer, or the treaſuries of the great; and the lion of the foreſt boaſts an honor, ſuperior to every irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man in creation; it is, my Lord, that little ſpark of immortality; that celeſtial flame that GOD has breathed into him, that makes him diſcriminate between good and evil; that fits him to bear the miſfortunes of this life with digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

Not one word more, my Lord, ſaid ſhe, (for he was interrupting her;) I can attend to you no longer; for though your tenets are to me not dangerous; they are horrid; they ſhock me, and I ſhudder that I ever converſed upon them, and beg I may never be forced to liſten to them again.

               <p>AS ſoon as JULIA was left alone, ſhe began to reflect upon the conſequences of irritat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a man; a man who had wealth and power on his ſide; and who feared neither GOD nor man; who acknowledged no being ſuperior to himſelf; and who impiouſly defied the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine vengeance, by doubting his exiſtence. Her anger was weak and imbecile; ſhe had no friend, no protector, except that Being whom the Count had derided, and in whom ſhe had hitherto plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a confidence, in every evil; ſhe felt not her confidence weakened; but ſhe thought it beſt, if poſſible to gain time. She remembered, that the youthful and beardleſs ſhepherd, had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the lofty, and proud Goliah; and ſhe truſted that ſhe ſhould not be ſacrificed, weak, and humble as ſhe was, to this haughty defier of GOD and all that was ſacred; but ſhe determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to behave with prudence, that even thoſe who truſt in worldly prudence might not blame her; in three days, ſhe could reaſonably expect, the Counteſs warned of her danger, would be on the way to relieve her; and in four ſhe hoped to ſee her. She reſolved to write a line before the time the Count had proſcribed her, was expir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, requiring three more days; if that requeſt
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:039134_0204_1013B18A7A5C5690"/>
was granted, ſhe thought herſelf ſafe; if not, her whole reliance, was upon Providence, and as ſhe felt the need of that reliance, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he found it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed.</p>
               <p>One ſource of ſatisfaction was now denied her, that ſhe had before enjoyed; ſhe could no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er walk upon the terrace, but confined to a gloomy chamber, with no company, but her own reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; the day ſeemed long and irkſome; and when the evening arrived, Philada could only ſpend a few moments with her. By her ſhe learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the company was increaſed; that the Chatteau was as full as poſſible, and that they would the next day celebrate a great feſtival. How wicked (ſaid ſhe, as Philada locked the door) muſt the aſſociates of this man be? how wretched a proſpect have they before them? I will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy them their liberty, their mirth, or their gaiety, for I ſhould rather, infinitely rather, ſpend a long life, ſhut up, in this dreary, chamber, with the hopes I entertain of futurity, and the firm belief of a GOD, than like them enjoy every thing here, and have no hope that is ſubſtantial, to brighten the proſpects of a future ſtate.</p>
               <p>In theſe reflections, ſhe ſpent that, and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing night; and beheld the next approach with a trembling anxiety; two days were expir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſhe had not altered her reſolution reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Count; yet the more ſhe reflected, the more ſhe dreaded enraging him. She therefore wrote him a ſhort note, requeſting three days more, to conſider of his propoſal, and promiſing a final anſwer when that time was clapſed. In leſs than half an hour Philada returned, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting her with a ſtrip of paper, ſhe read the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words:</p>

               <p>This note daſhed her hopes intirely, for the Counteſs could not grant her any relief ſo ſoon; as it was impoſſible, for Jaques to have delivered his meſſage, and returned by that time; ſhe ſat down on the bed, and giving way to deſpair, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt expected he would come this night: She detained Philada with her for ſome time, and endeavored to prevail on her to aid her eſcape; but the terrors of her weak mind placed ſo many difficulties in the way, that JULIA could not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; and ſhe ſaw her cloſe the door upon her, with a preſage that ſhe never felt before.</p>
               <p>She ſat with her head, reſted upon the caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in a ſtate of mind that defied the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic of the ſpheres to ſoothe, or calm; and thoug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="210" facs="unknown:039134_0206_1013B18EBAD64950"/>
upon her ear, as Colwort's. The recollection of what ſhe had ſeen in the tomb, now ruſhed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her mind, and combining his appearance, with the voice; ſhe no longer doubted but he was dead; and that his apparition had now come to give her warning of her approaching fate; una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſuſtain ſuch ſhocking ſenſations, ſhe fainted and ſunk upon the floor, it was ſome time before ſhe recovered her recollection; and when ſhe did, ſuch horrid images ruſhed upon her mind, that ſhe had nearly relapſed into the ſame ſtate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. After ſeveral exertions, ſhe got to the bed, and there tears came to her relief; for ſome time ſhe indulged them, until at length nature wearied out with exertions, ſhe fell into a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed ſleep; which laſted however, but a ſhort time. She awoke with the firſt crowing of the cock, and again revolving in her mind the moſt horrid images, ſhe recollected that the criſis of her fate approached, and that fortitude would be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, to ſupport her; ſhe endeavored at reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and prayed for that ſupport ſhe needed. As the morning advanced, ſhe became calmer, and when Philada entered with her breakfaſt, ſhe had reſolution enough to eat ſomething.</p>
               <p>The day, however, was long and tireſome, and when at length the dreaded night come, and no news from the Counteſs, no releaſe from the Count, not one glimmer of hope entered her gloomy abode to cheer it from without; all her reſources were from within. The hours paſſed on without interruption until eleven, when the door opened, and the Count entered; he ſtarted at her pale face and languid looks, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for her health, and ſeated himſelf beſide

her. After heſitating for a moment, he aſked her with apparent agitation, if ſhe was ready, to give him an anſwer. She replied firmly, that ſhe had no anſwer to give him; that he knew her mind, and that it had not for one moment heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated with reſpect to her deciſion. I know I have nothing to expect from your juſtice (ſaid ſhe) let me claim ſomething from your pity! it is your mercy, that I now implore to protect me againſt yourſelf; I am defenceleſs and wretched, I throw myſelf upon your protection! Oh ſave me from the worſt of evils, and reſtore me to my friends; or if that is diſpleaſing, immure me in a nunnery; confine me to a convent, but do not force me to a connection that my ſoul abhors!</p>
               <p>She was upon her knees before him, and he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored in vain to raiſe her. No, never will I riſe, ſaid, ſhe until you have aſſured me of my ſafety! In my arms (he cried) you will be ſafe; they ſhall be your priſon, and I will be your guard, obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and ungrateful as you are; I will make you happy, for I love you; and that love ſhall plead my excuſe. He threw his arms around her and attempted to embrace her, but ſhe ſhrunk, as from the touch of a torpedo, and hardly knowing what ſhe did, called loudly for aſſiſtance. At that inſtant a violent puſh againſt the door forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it open, and ſome one exclaimed, turn villain, and defend yourſelf; the Count turned upon his opponent, and ſnatched his ſword from the table; ſeveral thruſts paſſed upon both ſides, until at length the ſword of the ſtranger entered the right arm of the Count; his foot got entangled in the carpet, and he fell with his head againſt the poſt of the bedſted, and fetching a deep groan, became ſenſeleſs.</p>

JULIA had raiſed herſelf an anxious witneſs, and when her deliverer approached her, ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered Colwort; her joy and aſtoniſhment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived her of the power of ſpeech, and to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty, ſhe could only anſwer by holding out both her hands. He preſſed thoſe hands to his lips, until at length her ſpirits became reſtored, and ſhe begged him to tell her from whence he came; this is no time for enquiries, cried he, do my love exert yourſelf, that we may leave this dreadful ſcene; and though he does not deſerve it, call ſome one to aſſiſt this bad man, for I would not leave him thus; and this manſion is full of his emmiſſaries. He is gone, (ſaid JULIA,) as ſhe ſtooped down; he is gone with all his vices, with all his load of crimes upon his head to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before an angry GOD.</p>
               <p>Colwort thought the ſame; but fears for her ſafety prompted a deceit; he aſſured her that the Count was only ſtunned by the fall, that he would ſend help the moment he had got her out of doors; thus aſſured, ſhe aſſumed fortitude to leave the chamber, and though ſhe trembled with fear and apprehenſion, yet his preſence encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged her, and with haſty ſteps, they gained the ſtaircaſe, when they began to deſcend, they heard the groans of the Count; this added to their ſpeed, and they were in a moment upon the firſt landing, when a light burſt from a room be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and they beheld a lady aſcending by the ſame ſtairs; it was impoſſible to avoid her; or to retreat; they muſt meet, and upon her turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a winding, the candle threw its rays full up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her face, and in the midſt of her fears and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, JULIA diſcovered Donna Olivia. She
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:039134_0209_1013B196E1BEEA80"/>
intreated to go back, but Colwort almoſt forced her forward, and in another moment they found themſelves diſcovered! Donna Olivia looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them aſtoniſhed; Colwort attempted to puſh by her, but ſhe beſought him to ſtop, and deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to know where they were going. Colwort enraged at this delay, refuſed an anſwer; and JULIA intreated Olivia to let them paſs unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted. Is it you, Madamoiſelle, (ſaid ſhe,) I wiſh not to detain you? I have but juſt diſcovered you were here, and with the old houſe-keeper have been laying a plan for your eſcape. In the Court yard you will find a horſe, and ſervant, who will attend you, to a place of ſafety; unleſs this young gentleman chuſes to have that pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure; read this paper, and after that deliver it, as directed, and when you think of the vicious O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livia, think of her with ſymphathy. It was no time for thanks, Colwort informed her of the ſituation of the Count, and with an haſty and agitated ſtep, ſhe left them, to go to him.</p>
               <p>COLWORT and JULIA deſcended the ſtaircaſe, croſſed the hall, and went into the court where they found horſes, and a ſervant who aſſiſted to ſet her on horſeback, and Colwort having mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they rode off with as much expedition as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; with a ſpeed, that newly acquired ſpirits, renovated hope, and liberty juſt recovered, lent them.</p>
               <p>So quickly had the incidents of the laſt half hour ſucceeded each other, that JULIA thought it almoſt the work of enchantment, and that her deliverance was the buſineſs of fancy, or an airy dream. The freſh air, the cloudleſs ſky, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand twinkling ſtars, reſtored her tranquillity, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:039134_0210_1013B1999C2903D0"/>
before her lover could aſſure her of her ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and enter into a converſation conſiſtent or regular. She then requeſted him to inform her, how he got information of her confinement, or what had brought him to her reſcue. I will, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied he, be as conciſe, as poſſible, for if the Count ſhould recover his recollection, his Chatteau is filled with his aſſociates, and we may be purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is now three weeks ſince I arrived in France; directed by the letters of the Counteſs, I ſet off for Paris, attended only by a faithful ſervant, that had accompanied me to America; we were within half a days journey of the capital when we were joined by two perſons, who had the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of gentlemen; they ſoon found, that my viſit was intended to the Counteſs DE LAU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NA, they were acquainted with her, and you, and informed me that you had both ſet out for the Villa three days ſince; that the health of Madam DE LAUNA, was ſo poor, that you had left Paris, the day after your return from Spain. The ſtory was feaſible, and I became the dupe; I had until then travelled in a public ſtage, but at the firſt Inn, I ordered horſes, for myſelf and ſervant, and ſet out for the Villa; the next day in the afternoon, we were ſurrounded, by ten men on horſeback, well armed and a carriage at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending; we defended ourſelves, for ſome time, but were at laſt ſeized, bound, and put into the carriage. In two days I arrived here with my guards, and was immediately led to a priſon; here I continued, near a fortnight, when in exploring the receſſes of my dungeon, for ſuch it might be called, I found a paſſage that led to a tomb; I immediately laid a plan to eſcape, for I knew
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:039134_0211_1013B19C43261B48"/>
not my tyrant nor the reaſon of this confinement. One night, laſt week, I ſaw a light in this recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle of death; I opened the door, that led to it with caution, and to my aſtoniſhment, beheld two women, and a man intently examining a coffin; I immediately formed the deſign of paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, which I could with eaſe, and ſafety, have done, but curioſity prompted me to exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine the faces of the perſons ſo employed; when I came a little more to the light, I thought in one, I diſcovered the features and countenance of my JULIA; before I could enough diveſt my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of ſurprize, to be aſſured of the truth of my conjecture, I was diſcovered. One of the women fainted, and the light was extinguiſhed; the firſt impulſe of my ſoul, was to aſſiſt you, for it was indeed yourſelf. But a ſentiment that I could not define, withheld me; the tomb was left open, and I left my priſon; I repaired to a neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cottage, where I gained much information reſpecting the Chatteau, and its inhabitants; I found too, that a lady was confined there. The next day the Count arrived with his friends; I diſguiſed myſelf like one of the attendants; and got admittance; as ſuch I had no fears of being diſcovered, I had been brought in the night, and ſince my arrival had ſeen no one, except the man who brought me my food; and him only by night; my dreſs was different, and my diſguiſe complete. Laſt night I found your cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber door, and called to you by name, but you were aſleep or did not hear me. A noiſe below obliged me to leave my ſtation; but to day I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured horſes, to be in waiting, and was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to reſcue you, or periſh in the attempt.
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:039134_0212_1013B19F02A137C0"/>
It was ſurely Heaven that ſent me, at that peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, when I was ſo much wanted; and yet, we ſhould not have effected our eſcape, but for the lady, who is, I ſuppoſe, the Count's miſtreſs.</p>
               <p>He ended his narrative, with expreſſions of gratitude, to that power, who had thus far pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected them, and profeſſions of a paſſion as tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and faithful, as it was ſincere; and JULIA gave him an account, of every thing, that had happened to her ſince he left the Villa. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation laſted until morning, and with a heart filled with grateful ſenſations, JULIA beheld the ſun ariſe. How different were her emotions now; and the laſt time ſhe ſaw it, ſhe remarked this difference to Colwort; who could now view her beautiful, and intereſting face, with rapture; and they enjoyed the moſt ſublime pleaſures, thoſe of mingled gratitude, love and friendſhip.</p>
               <p>As the morning advanced, they entered a little town, and Colwort left his horſes at the firſt Inn they came to, and hired a chaiſe, for that day's journey, and JULIA purchaſed ſome things, that were neceſſary, the fear of being overtaken prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their taking any repoſe, and after a ſlight refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they ſat forward to the Villa. When Colwort looked at JULIA and ſaw her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance animated, though her face was pale, and though her eyes expreſſed joy and hope, they were ſunk and languid; he thought he had nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſeen any thing ſo beautiful before; he held her hand in his; he preſſed it to his lips, and in the ſofteſt and moſt energetic language expreſſed his love, his delight, his hopes, and anticipated joys, of days and years, ſpent in her dear ſociety.</p>
               <p>They made long ſtages, and at night JULIA

found herſelf, ſo much fatigued, as to be unable to purſue her journey without repoſe; beſides the carriage, was only hired for one day, and was now diſmiſſed, when they ſtopped at a public houſe, and JULIA preferred paſſing the night, at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, that was in the neighbourhood; Colwort immediately conducted her, and ſhe was agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſurprized, to find when ſhe arrived, it was the ſame convent, ſhe had once been entertained at, with the Counteſs DE LAUNA; the Abbeſſ and ſeveral of the nuns recognized her, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived her with pleaſure for the night; Colwort was invited to ſtay to ſupper, with the ſuperior, and upon his taking leave, deſired to breakfaſt with them the next morning; as he left the parlour, JULIA followed him, with her eyes, and ſighed as the door ſhut him from her view; ſhe was aſhamed of the pre-ſentiment, ſhe was then ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, and endeavoured to ſhake it off; after a ſhort converſation, the Abbeſs conducted her to her chamber; and a bed and repoſe were never more welcome to the weary traveller, than they now were to the fatigued and exhauſted girl. But though ſhe wooed with the moſt pleaſing ſenſations, the drowſy god, it was late, and the convent clock had ſtruck twelve, before he deigned to cloſe her eyelids; when ſhe awoke, the ſun had riſen to a conſiderable height, and fearful that ſhe had treſpaſſed upon the rules of the houſe, or made Colwort wait, ſhe dreſſed her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in haſte, and deſcended to the parlour.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>AFTER the compliments of the morning, the Abbeſs expreſſed her ſurprize, that Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort did not make his appearance; ſhe wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed half an hour and then ſent a ſervant to the Inn to enquire for him; he was abſent but a few minutes, when he returned with the dreadful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that the young gentleman had been ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the officers of juſtice, for the murder of the Count DE LAUNA, and carried to Paris at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night.</p>
               <p>When JULIA heard this news, a death-like ſtupor pervaded her ſenſes; ſhe ſat like a ſtatue, no tears, no ſigh, declared her diſtreſs; her eyes fixt in deſpair upon the floor; her hands lifted up, and her whole frame in the attitude of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, too ſevere to be expreſſed; the Abbeſs moved and alarmed at her ſituation endeavoured to provoke her tears. After ſome time ſhe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, and when her full heart was in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure relieved, ſhe informed this benevolent wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, of all that had happened to her, and aſked her what ſhe would adviſe her to do? I would adviſe you, my dear, ſaid that good lady, to proceed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the Villa, inform the Counteſs of every circumſtance, and you will inſure her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in favour of Mr. Colwort.</p>
               <p>JULIA aroſe with ſpirit, and prepared to act,
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:039134_0215_1013B1A71E11E428"/>
agreeably to the advice, ſhe had received, which indeed agreed with her own ſentiments; but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſending out, no chaiſe or carriage of any kind was to be procured, for that day; and a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who lived in the neighbourhood of the Counteſs, and was a friend of the Abbeſs, heard of what had happened, and as he had buſineſs, a few miles, beyond the Villa, propoſed to carry JULIA to the Counteſs, the next morning, if ſhe would put herſelf under his protection.</p>
               <p>Though ſhe felt extreme reluctance, to tarry another night, from the Villa, and ſhe thought it her duty to take every ſtep, in her power, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe her lover immediately, yet ſhe was obliged to ſubmit to this delay.</p>
               <p>This day was perhaps the longeſt of her life, and the moſt painful. Very early the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the gentleman called at the convent; ſhe had been ready a long while, and after taking an affectionate leave, of the worthy Abbeſs, and friendly nuns, ſhe ſeated herſelf by the ſide of Monſieur Duboit, and began her journey to the, Villa; though this gentleman was ſenſible, and kind, yet he had not thoſe qualities, which could ſhorten the diſtance, to a mind ſo diſtreſſed as her's was; the unfortunate girl after a few at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts at converſation, became ſilent, and retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within herſelf, found a vaſt horde of miſery for her contemplation.</p>
               <p>The ſun had gained his meridian ſummit, and ſhe was awoke from her reverie by her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, who pointed out to her the buildings of the Villa; at this cheering ſight, hope which had almoſt deſerted, returned; her boſom became animated, and ſhe anticipated the embraces of
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:039134_0216_1013B1AB4B049650"/>
the Counteſs; her exertions in favour of Colwort, and his reſtoration to liberty; they were now within half a mile of the end of her journey, when they were overtaken by a ſervant, who came to inform Monſieur Duboit, that his eld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſon had met with a moſt diſtreſſing accident, and that his immediate preſence was required. The gentleman became diſtreſſed, and JULIA deſired he would let her alight, as ſhe could with eaſe, and pleaſure walk the little diſtance, in a ſhort time. She expreſſed her ſorrow for his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction; thanked him for his attention; and he permitted her to get out of the chaiſe.</p>
               <p>She proceeded with alacrity, until ſhe came to the gate, but was ſurprized, to find it locked; a circumſtance that perſuaded her, that the Counteſs, had not returned, as it was always left open, when ſhe was at home; ſhe rang the bell, and in a few moments ſaw the porter coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs the Park.—Oh Pedro, (ſaid ſhe,) I am glad to ſee you; where is your lady, and how do you all do? We are all well, Madamoiſelle (he replied,) my lady is ſtill at Paris. I am ſorry (cried JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIA,) for that, (and ſhe wondered that he did not open the gate,) when do you expect her? We do not know when; but we heard from her yeſterday (he ſaid in a ſulkey tone,) and ſhe ſent down word, (he added,) and an order, that you ſhould not be admitted at the Villa; not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted (ſaid JULIA,) then I am undone! I cannot help that (cryed he with great indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,) you won't enter here, and you had beſt leave the gate. Good Heaven, (ſaid JULIA,) where can I go? And what will become of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort? That is your look out, (ſaid the brutal
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:039134_0217_1013B1ACCC59E550"/>
fellow,) but I adviſe you to leave the gate im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.</p>
               <p>It would be impoſſible to deſcribe the ſtate of JULIA'S mind at this inſtant, but amidſt her own deſtitute and forlorn ſituation, the fate of her lover, was uppermoſt. The brutality of this man, added ingratitude to his baſeneſs, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned a pang, ſhe had never felt before; a few days before, ſhe had left the Villa, this fellow had been diſmiſſed, for ſome high miſdemeanor; but at the intreaties of JULIA, he had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and forgiven; he profeſſed the utmoſt gratitude for her interceſſion; and ſuch was her opinion of the human heart, that ſhe imagined, he would have died to ſerve her; his conduct o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened her eyes, and the haſty retroſpect ſhe now took of her ſhort and unfortunate life, ſhe found many inſtances that led her to ſuſpect thoſe merits, ſhe had been tenacious in ſuppoſing inhabited every boſom, were but the viſionary phantoms of her own imagination, or the garb that veil from mortal ken, the vices or follies of mankind.</p>
               <p>She did not however wait for another order to quit the gate, but with a burſting heart ſhe turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down the country road; ſhe knew not where to go, nor which way to proceed, but walked with hurried ſteps, until ſhe came to another avenue, that led to the houſe, ſhe had loved ſo well; a little ſeat had been raiſed out ſide the walk, it was now covered with jaſmine, and woodbine; and ſhe remembered how often ſhe had been ſeated upon it, with the Counteſs; ſhe recollected too, for memory now became a cruel and faithful intruder, that the very day before ſhe left that charming retirement, ſhe had read Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:039134_0218_1013B1AE596B08C8"/>
in Engliſh to the Marquis; ſhe recollected that upon that very ſeat, the Counteſs had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed her pity for the firſt offender, "and yet (ſaid ſhe,) ſhe drives me from her preſence, and ſends me out an helpleſs wanderer, to a world that I do not know, and to which I am a ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; I ſhall never more enter this walk again; never again taſte the pleaſure of being beloved by this beſt of women, or hearing her inſtructions; deſerted by the only friend I ever knew; loſt to my wretched lover; an helpleſs, friendleſs orph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; what will become of me?" As ſhe indulged theſe thoughts, a thouſand tender recollections ruſhed upon her mind, and almoſt overpowered her ſenſes: She ſunk on her knees before the ſeat and would have prayed, but the hurricane in her boſom, prevented her connecting her ideas. In this ſituation, wiſhing for death as her only friend, ſhe continued for a ſhort time; until ſhe was arouſed from this ſtupor, by a perſon who in a ſweet, perſuaſive, but manly voice, begged to know what had reduced her to ſuch diſtreſs; ſhe juſt looked up and waved her hand for him to leave her.—"What, leave you, (ſaid he) in this ſituation? No, Heaven forbid. Put it in my power, to ſerve you; let me ſee you compoſed, for I cannot leave you." Oh, (ſaid JULIA) I am wretched and undone; you cannot help me; leave me to that fate that follows me. "No, (replied he) lady, I will not leave you; if you are undone by the frailty of human nature, for who is exempt from frailty, I will pour into your wounded heart the balm and oil of ſymphathy, I will aſſiſt your ſteps to regain the paths of virtue; if you are unhappy by the baſeneſs or ingratitude of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:039134_0219_1013B1B220DE90E8"/>
I will ſymphathize with you in all your ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and be a companion in all your griefs; if you have loſt your friends, I and mine will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their place; if you are poor, my fortune is at your command; but deſire me not to leave you." Thank GOD, (ſaid JULIA,) I have no great error to accuſe myſelf of; but, I am deſerted by my friends; I have, no relations, no fortune; no houſe; no home; and know not where to lay my head. "The Saviour of mankind, the King of all the earth, (cried the ſtranger,) knew not where to lay his head; I profeſs myſelf his follower; an humble follower; but a ſincere believer in him, who died for ſinners; my religion bids me to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt thoſe who are diſtreſſed; confide in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion then; and let me be your protector; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til we can find one, who better deſerves that name." JULIA looked at him, and in his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting countenance, and intelligent, though plain features, read ſuch a collection of virtues as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſilenced every doubt; he ſpoke with all the energy of an honeſt, though enthuſiaſtic heart. She obſerved he had a chaiſe in waiting; his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alect, though he ſpoke good French, convinced her he was a foreigner, his tall and manly perſon almoſt awed her anxiety to peace. Alas, (ſaid ſhe,) what ſhall I do? "Let me convey you lady, to a place of eaſe, and ſafety, (he replied,) a few miles from hence lives a country woman of mine; ſhe is the daughter of ſorrow and has drank all the cup of affliction; misfortune has become fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to her; but ſtill ſhe preſerves every virtue, and cheriſhes every charity. I will carry you to her, and if a doubt ſtill remains, let this remove it. I love and am beloved by one, of the beſt of
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:039134_0220_1013B1B600723260"/>
her ſex; in a few weeks I ſhall receive her hand at the altar, as a pledge of laſting happineſs; if ſhe is what I think her, ſhe would not receive me with a tranſport of ardent welcome, were I capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble either of betraying one, who confided in me, or leaving one in diſtreſs; but if you will not be prevailed upon to go with me, tell me to what aſylum I ſhall convey you, for ſee the ſun is now verging to his repoſe, and I will not leave you."</p>
               <p>This laſt argument prevailed, and ſhe ſuffered herſelf to be put into the chaiſe, and the ſervant drove off.</p>
               <p>This young gentleman was one of thoſe few, who at the early age of twenty four was poſſeſſed of every virtue; his name was Roſwell, he was the eldeſt ſon of a worthy man, who cultivated a large unincumbered eſtate of his own, in the North of England; he had received all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of a good education; his perſon was good; his mind improved; his heart open; his temper frank, and his diſpoſition benevolent; early in life, he became attached to religion, and wiſhed at his quitting college, to take orders im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately; but his father who in the laſt three years had loſt all his children, thought this the ſcheme of monkiſh ſuperſtition, and to divert him from it, had inſiſted upon it, that he ſhould ſpend four years in France and Italy previous to this ſtep. This was a great ſelf denial, to the young man, who knew that the profeſſion he wiſhed to embrace, did not exclude the ſocial charities, innocent pleaſures, or real gratifications; he knew that it embraced them all in a moſt exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive point of view; for he was ſure that a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious Clergyman was the father of his people,
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:039134_0221_1013B1B785446768"/>
the friend of the poor, and the protector of all the children of ſorrow; beſides he had with extreme avidity from his childhood cultivated an acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with a lovely little orphan, who was left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the protection of his father; in mind and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent alike, they loved their own virtues in each other; early accuſtomed to love each other, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration was to them the greateſt afflicton, and to meet, the greateſt joy they were capable of taſting, they both diſcovered, while very young, that their happineſs would conſiſt in living for each other, and when Roſwell acknowledged his attachment, the bluſhing Lucretia, owned a ſimilar affection.</p>
               <p>His father had long known the virtues of this charming girl, he approved his ſon's choice, and engaged that in four years, Lucretia ſhould be his; Lucretia had prided herſelf upon her penetration for ſhe had at a very early age diſcovered thoſe qualities, that now began to mature; and ſhe not only loved but reverenced them; painful was the idea of four years' abſence, yet when Roſwell knew, that Lucretia was to be the ſure, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple reward of his obedience, he entered upon it with as much avidity, as the patriarch did, when he began his ſeven years ſervitude for the beaute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Rachel. And this attachment was perhaps neceſſary to preſerve a youth of his fire and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ergy, from the vices and follies with which he was ſurrounded. Half the term of probation was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſed, when he was ſummoned home upon a melancholy errand; to cloſe the eyes of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and comfort a widowed mother, was the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice that was aſſigned him; and he undertook it with reſigned alacrity. But when he arrived in England, the lamp of life was not ſo far extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:039134_0222_1013B1BB7A87D360"/>
in the father, but that he beheld his ſon's improvements with pleaſure, and fondly anticipat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that period when the talents and genius of Roſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, expanded by the hand of time, would aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh as well as better mankind; this idea purſued him in his dying moments, and ambitious for ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery improvement, he conjured his ſon to contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue his travels, for two years longer before he ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in life.</p>
               <p>Young Roſwell would, to ſooth and comfort a dying parent, have promiſed any thing, within the verge of poſſibility, and a few weeks after his deceaſe, left his native country, and returned to France; there with an heart full of his mother, and his Lucretia, he purſued every ſtudy that was either uſeful, or ornamental, and practiced every virtue that can do honor to human nature. His term of probation was nearly expired, and he meant to ſpend the laſt ſix weeks in France, with an old lady, that he reverenced and ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; this was the time of his meeting JULIA.</p>
               <p>For ſome time after they had commenced their little journey; loſt in grief, wonder and fear, unaccompanied by hope, ſhe rode ſeveral miles without ſpeaking, and Mr. Roſwell was too well acquainted with the human heart to interrupt this ſilence; he knew by experience, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort comes in vain, that comes too ſoon; and he forbore one word either of ſympathy, or remark; ſatisfied that he was performing a benevolent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he was laying plans to be ſtill more uſeful, and anticipating a pleaſing reward he ſhould meet with in his Lucretia's augmented love; more than half their little ride was performed, when he began a converſation by ſome remarks
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:039134_0223_1013B1BD003A2E88"/>
upon the twilight, that were ſo much like what ſhe had heard drop from the lips of Colwort, that they occaſioned a deep ſigh, and after a few moments ſilence, ſhe aſked him his country; when informed that he was an Engliſhman, ſhe felt ſomething like the revival of thoſe hopes, that had been ſo cruelly blaſted at the Villa; Do you know a young gentleman of your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, by the name of Francis COLWORT, ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired? "Only by report (he returned;) pray what of him?" Oh, (ſaid JULIA) he is miſerable, and I am the wretched cauſe; when I found you were his countryman, I did not know, I was ſo fooliſh as to admit hope. "Hope, (ſaid he) entertain it ſtill; it is a delightful viſitor; make it ſo wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come that it become a conſtant inhabitant of your boſom." Alas! ſaid JULIA, my fate has been ſo wayward, that it almoſt totally excludes the charming viſitant. "When you can without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed pain, young lady, favour me with a recit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of your ſorrows, you will oblige me, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, put it in my power to ſerve you; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs that can be done without the ſacrifice of a moment's quiet, I will not aſk the pleaſure."</p>
               <p>JULIA in a frank, and conciſe manner, inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him of the events of her life, and her real ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and in the courſe of her little narrative, diſcovered ſo much good ſenſe, and ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al merit, as inſured her the admiration, as well as eſteem of Roſwell. He aſſured her, that he would the very next day, take active meaſures in behalf of COLWORT, and ſee the Counteſs, as ſoon as poſſible, as he was ſure, ſhe had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon; in the mean time, he begged her
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:039134_0224_1013B1BFC2485DA8"/>
to be eaſy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and again aſſured her of the comfort and honor of the place ſhe was going to.</p>
               <p>Few Engliſhmen were better qualified, than Mr. Roſwell, for this undertaking; he had been in France ſo long, that he was well acquainted with its laws, cuſtoms, and manners; but his temper was ſo ſanguine, that he always looked upon the bright ſide of every picture, and he doubted not of his ſucceſs in ſpite of the Baſtile, which fancy had conjured up to torture him; but he carefully avoided to mention his fears, and only ſpake of hope; his converſation, was ſuch a combination of good ſenſe, genius, and ſolid piety, that every word he ſpake was full of conſolation; it calmed the tumults of her troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led mind, and ſoothed her into peace.</p>
               <p>It was near ten o'clock, at right, when they arrived at a little, neat manſion, that ſtood in the ſuburbs of a village, he lifted her from the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and with every expreſſion of comfort, led her into the houſe; here they were met by a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable woman, who had counted more than ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enty years. "My good Madam, (cried Roſwell,) how do you do? Here I have brought you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> charming companion: ſhe is unhappy, you muſt teach her to be otherways." I think (ſaid the old lady,) ſhe muſt be good, as you recommend her; I will endeavour to render her cheerful, at leaſt." She conducted them into a little parlour, and tho' ſhe was pleaſed with the perſon and manners of JULIA, yet ſhe was grieved at the evident marks of illneſs, that ſickneſs had impreſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her face. Indeed the tumults of her mind, the fatigues of her perſon, and want of reſt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected her ſo much, that ſhe found herſelf ſinking
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:039134_0225_1013B1C28C581478"/>
beneath them; after a ſlight repaſt, her kind hoſteſs conducted her to her chamber, where ſhe helped undreſs, and put her to bed.</p>
               <p>With a deep and heavy ſigh, JULIA laid her aching head upon the pillow, and endeavored to compoſe herſelf. But how different was her ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, to what it was a few days before, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by her lover on her way to her benefact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs, a thouſand gay viſions fluttered before her eyes, and dazzled her in proſpect. She was now deprived of that lover who would in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility ſuffer an ignominious death; diſcarded by that benefactreſs; in the care of ſtrangers; at a diſtance from any place ſhe had ever ſeen. Theſe reflections did not ſerve to cloſe her eyes, nor ſooth the tumultuous agitations of her heart; but ſhe lay apparently reſigned, and patient, until near day, when a tranſient ſlumber ſhut out the paſt, and to come, from her view, and ſhe did not awake until morning, dreſſed in all its ſplendor, appeared to drive the drowſy god, from ſcenes ſo light and charming.</p>
               <p>"How are you my dear, (ſaid Madam de Shong) who ſtood by her bed ſide? JULIA gave her hand, which was dry and hot, and replied ſhe was better than ſhe had been the night before, and would riſe directly. Do not riſe my love, (ſaid the kind woman,) you are too ill; ſhe left the room and returned in a moment with a medicine; ſhe then bathed her throbbing temples, and in a ſhort time ſhe became compoſed, and after a few hours reſt, became refreſhed and better.</p>
               <p>She did not ſee Roſwell until near night, when he came in, he found her in converſation with the old lady, who had engaged her friendſhip and
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:039134_0226_1013B1C66A129D58"/>
eſteem, by her mildneſs and benevolence; Roſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well aſſured her that if ſhe had been well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to have given him particular directions, he ſhould have ſet off that morning, in purſuit of Mr. Colwort; "but (ſaid he) I will go tomorrow, and only leave this injunction upon you, that you will be as eaſy as poſſible until my return; hope for every thing that you wiſh; but remember if thoſe wiſhes are not gratified, that he who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies them has not only infinite power, and infinite wiſdom, but infinite mercy." JULIA promiſed obedience to his directions, and after again ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing her ſenſe of the obligation, ſhe was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to him, retired to her apartment to write to COLWORT, and when ſhe had finiſhed her letter to him, wrote a few lines to the Counteſs DE LAUNA, in which ſhe expreſſed her gratitude for paſt favours; her ſorrow for having offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her; and her prayers and wiſhes for her hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; ſhe ſet the affair between the COUNT and COLWORT, in a true light, and implored her mercy and interference in behalf of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate young man. In this letter ſhe did not mention the place of her abode, nor drop one hint which would lead to a diſcovery of her real ſituation. The exertion that was neceſſary to the writing theſe letters, exhauſted her ſo much, that as ſoon as they were finiſhed, ſhe went to bed, as ſhe could there indulge her feelings, with more freedom, than in any other place. She a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe early, and ſound Roſwell ready to ſet out upon his benevolent journey; the fire of genius that was expreſſed upon his countenance, was ſo ſoftened by the expreſſion of humanity, ſo mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mixed with benevolence, that JULIA could
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:039134_0227_1013B1C7ECD5FF30"/>
not help thinking him one of the moſt intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men ſhe had ever ſeen. He attended to all her directions; received her letters, and promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do all within the power of a mortal, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore her lover, and happineſs; he bade them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieu, and was followed by their prayers and good wiſhes.</p>

               <p>WHEN he was gone, ſhe determined not to ſink into unavailing melancholy, and to avoid it, ſought for employment; Madam De Shong complied with her requeſt, and as ſhe employed all her moments to ſome uſeful purpoſe, preſented her with ſome linen that ſhe had taken to make; JULIA pleaſed that ſhe could be of ſervice, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with niceneſs and alacrity, and gave her wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy landlady pleaſure and ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>The third day after her arrival, they were at work in a little parlour; JULIA could not help making an obſervation, that had often occured to her that the manners of her entertainer were ſo poliſhed, that ſhe muſt have moved in a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:039134_0228_1013B1CAA32BD860"/>
different from her preſent ſphere. Your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark is juſt, my dear, ſhe replied, and as my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes I think will convince you, that you are not the moſt unhappy perſon in the world, I will, if my loquacious egotiſm will not tire you, I will tell you my ſtory. JULIA aſſured her, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could oblige her more, and ſhe began as follows:</p>
               <q>  
                  <p>"My father was a wealthy and reſpectable Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net of the County of Kent, in the kingdom of Great-Britain; of five children, I alone ſurvived my infancy; and of conſequence became the darling of my parents; the whole attention of my excellent mother was beſtowed upon my ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ucation, and my father was never ſo happy as when procuring ſomething to ornament or pleaſe his daughter; in my education my mother de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined that the uſeful, ſhould be mingled with the ornamental; and I was taught every kind of family employment; I have often thought that a kind of pre-ſentiment of the misfortunes, that were to attend my life, induced this; as I then thought unneceſſary care. I ſometimes ſpoke of this, to my mother, who always replied, that a woman ought to be acquainted with every kind of family buſineſs, before ſhe commenced houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper; that a knowledge in domeſtic affairs was oftentimes abſolutely neceſſary, and could not be an incumbrance in any ſituation, as it would not interfere with any polite or elegant ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment. I loved and reſpected my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents too much to diſpute their commands, and endeavored to make myſelf miſtreſs of all thoſe acquirements, that could endear me to them; as I was the undiſputed heireſs of a large fortune,
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:039134_0229_1013B1CE88C63358"/>
  it cannot be doubted, but I had a number of nominal lovers; and my heart ſoon gave the preference to a young gentleman, who was noble and wealthy, and had beſides ſuch accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as left theſe futile merits far behind them; my parents approved my choice; the day was affixed for my nuptials, but alas! it was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouded with woe, for my lover was ſeized with a violent fever, that terminated his exiſtence on the evening of that very day, to which I had for ſeveral months looked forward as the completion of my felicity; I do not pretend to deſcribe my feelings, at this beginning of my ſorrow; I thought then as you do now, that no miſery could e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual mine; I knew not that ſad experience, would convince me, that the afflictions that were to follow me through life, were began, but light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by this. For many months I became a prey, to the moſt corroding grief, I thought it virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, to be wretched; I indulged my afflictions; I even nurſed them; but one ſorrow was driven off by another; by an heavier evil; my belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mother fell into a decline, and died in my arms; I ſaw my father ſinking beneath a weight of woe; I felt this ſevere chaſtiſement; but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a proof of the power of aſſumed fortitude; to relieve him, I concealed my own grief; and ſoon became what I had only pretended, cheerful; my excellent mother had had a ſiſter married in France; ſhe had long been dead; her huſband too had paid the debt of nature, ſome years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the period I am ſpeaking of; they had left one child, a ſon, he now came over to England, to viſit us. In the ſociety of this poliſhed, ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, amiable young man, I forgot my ſorrows,
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:039134_0230_1013B1D00B565418"/>
 and loſt a fooliſh prejudice, the error of young minds, that leads us to imagine the virtuous heart can never feel but one attachment. I had not allowed myſelf to reflect that ſimilar virtues, and ſimilar abilities, would create ſimilar attachments; it was the fate of this young man to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me, and to learn my heart a tender affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a ſecond time; indeed, ſo agreeable were its emotions, that I willingly indulged them, and received with avidity, impreſſions ſo pleaſing; my father beheld this change with pleaſure, he approved my choice, and in a few months, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the happy wife of the Chevalier Deſhong, in leſs than a year, I was bleſſed with a fine ſon, a circumſtance that gave us peculiar pleaſure, and was highly gratifying to my poor father. A large eſtate in Kent, was ſettled by entail upon the eldeſt grandſon that my father ſhould have, but in caſe of the death of that child, without heirs, it was to go to a very diſtant branch of the family; this was a valuable poſſeſſion, and my father did not look with philoſophy upon the probability of its going out of his family, and was quite tranſported with a child, whoſe healthy, promiſing appearance flattered him with the idea of long life.</p>
                  <p>"We were all happy for ſeveral years, and my felicity at that time was more, than I had any reaſon to expect, and more than could continue; in the courſe of this time, I had two ſons, and two lovely daughters; our board was covered with plenty; we were ſurrounded with elegance; and health ſpread its blooming tints upon every face; the firſt interruption to this ſeven years bliſs, was the death of my excellent, and lamented
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:039134_0231_1013B1D2C7ABEDA0"/>
 parent; he had been in a languiſhment, for ſome months, and met death with calmneſs and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
                  <p>"For ſeveral weeks after this event, I felt loſt to the world, and my family, but a dreadful acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent recalled me to renewed miſery; my eldeſt ſon, a lovely boy of eight years old was drowned in bathing; you are not a mother, and can but faintly conceive my agony; I ſhall paſs over my feelings, nor attempt to deſcribe them.</p>
                  <p>"My huſband propoſed that we ſhould go to France; I had buried all that rendered England dear to me, and conſented. But previous to this ſtep the young gentleman to whom our Kentiſh eſtate devolved, upon the death of my dear boy, had taken poſſeſſion of it, though he and his guardian had requeſted us to occupy it until he was of age; but every apartment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called ſome ſcene of pleaſure, and every tree was the ſhadow of departed bleſſings; and I wiſhed not to ſtay, where I thought I could never regain my peace, or tranquillity. My huſband turned the remainder of our property into money, and placed it to the amount of forty thouſand pounds in a principal banking houſe in London.</p>
                  <p>"We arrived in France, in ſafety, the care of my family by degrees diverted my attention, and before a year had elapſed, I became, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calm, but cheerful; I now began to obſerve ſomething uncommon in my daughter, an infant that was born three months after I loſt my ſon; but I hoped as ſhe grew older, it would wear off, and that ſhe might become like other children, but alas! I was miſtaken.</p>
                  <p>"We had not lived in France more than five
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:039134_0232_1013B1D4655E6FD0"/>
 years, and indulged in all the pleaſures of benev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, and affluent beyond our wiſhes, when we heard that the houſe, in which our property was veſted, had failed; my huſband was alarmed at this intelligence; went over to England; he found the report true, and as much fraud was ſuſpected, commenced a law ſuit that became tireſome and expenſive; for thirteen months, he continued in my native country; and ſpent a large ſum of money, after what was already gone; he returned diſappointed, and diſcouraged; but we were ſo imprudent as to continue our equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page and ſplendid way of living; until our houſe and property was attached; this was the final ſtroke to my unfortunate huſband, and he could not ſurvive it; in three months he fell a victim to diſeaſe, brought on by ſorrow, and died of a broken heart. There are ſome events that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſuch agonizing ſenſations, that it is danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to look back upon them; this is of that number, and I muſt paſs it over in ſilence.</p>
                  <p>"My children ſtill tied me to the world, and life was ſtill dear to me; two hundred louis dours, the produce of my jewels, and ſome furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, was all I preſerved, from the wreck of our once noble fortune; ſome friends of my huſband's, now exerted themſelves in my behalf; they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured my ſons admittance to the military ſchool, where all their neceſſary expences were defrayed, and were beſides extremely kind to me; but I could not brook dependence; I was ſtill too proud; my ſpirit was not ſubdued, and I ſet up a boarding houſe, for Engliſhmen; in this I was ſucceſsful, and now found the benefit of my mother's inſtruction; I educated my daughters
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:039134_0233_1013B1D85EC169C0"/>
 myſelf; with a houſe maid, and one man ſervant, I performed the buſineſs of my family. My table was ſo well ſupplied, my cookery ſo good, and ſo neat, that my houſe was filled with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable boarders; but though when in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with my family, I appeared cheerful, when I retired to my unfortunate Louiſa, my heart was burſting; of all the woes to which human nature is ſubjected, there is none can equal the diſtreſs of a fond mother, when ſhe finds that Providence has given her an idiotical child; this was my ſad ſate, my daughter was very pretty, but not one ray of reaſon, animated her fine features, or ſparkled in her beautiful eyes; no ſentiment, but rage was ever expreſſed upon her countenance; her paſſions were violent in the extreme, and ſhe required all the attention of one perſon, to keep her comfortable; her ſiſters by turns attended her, and if any thing could have made amends for the wretchedneſs ſhe occaſioned, it would have been their good ſenſe, good humour, and amiableneſs; but there is no evil, to which we do not by long habit, and acquaintance become ſo familiarized, as to looſe part of its deformity; in time I was really comfortable, and began again to enjoy life. My ſons completed their educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; commiſſions were given them of a rank ſuperior to what they had a right to expect; and they left France, to join the regiment abroad; fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the good wiſhes of all that knew them; and for young men covered with glory; my heart ſunk when they left me; I was not enough of the Roman, to ſee them go unmoved, and all the mother was in my boſom.</p>
                  <p>"Directly after their departure, the young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:039134_0234_1013B1DC5548D270"/>
 who inherited the eſtate of my ſon's, come over to Paris, to viſit me; I was charmed with his perſon, as I had before been by his character; and when he aſked the hand of my eldeſt daughter Maria, I gave my conſent with pleaſure; my dear girl did not heſitate to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a reciprocal attachment, and they were married within ſix months, of his arrival in France.</p>
                  <p>"They tarried with me ſix months longer, and their virtues not only endeared them, but the the world to me; at length it became neceſſary for my ſon in law, to return to England, and ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery perſuaſion was made uſe of, to prevail upon me to accompany him, but I could not leave France, yet I conſented that Sophia ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them; and I promiſed to join them the enſuing Autumn; I parted from theſe belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed children with tears, but the proſpect of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs that awaited them, ſweetened the parting pangs, and ſix weeks after I received a letter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming me of the ſad fate of both veſſel and crew, the packet was overſet by a gale of wind, and every ſoul except the captain periſhed! I now thought my woes could not increaſe, but I was miſtaken; the very next poſt brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence that my eldeſt ſon had fallen in battle; when I look back upon theſe events, that have been paſſed more than twenty years, I wonder that I retained my reaſon. But he who wounds the heart, can heal it, and he who afflicts can relieve.</p>
                  <p>"My heart was indeed almoſt broken, "woes came in cluſters around me," and when I beheld my poor unfortunate daughter, I exclaimed how
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:039134_0235_1013B1DDD6727D90"/>
 inſcrutable are the ways of Providence, thus to remove the uſeful, the lovely, and the amiable ornaments of ſociety; and leave her who is a wretched burden. But I bowed ſubmiſſive, and was reſigned; this wretched girl lived ten years after her ſiſter, and then died of a malignant fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that raged in Paris.</p>
                  <p>"After her death I diſmiſſed my lodgers, and with a ſum of money, ſufficient for my own  ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, retired to this village, where I lived con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with my little; a boarder in a cheap, but good family; until it pleaſed GOD to take my only earthly comfort; my ſon died abroad, and with his laſt breath bequeathed me this little girl; he had married in Flanders, and loſt his wife, at the birth of her child; I received her with about fifty piſtol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s. A ſhort time after the poor little thing became wholly an orphan; my health was poor, I could do but little, ſhe added to my expences, though her ſociety gave me pleaſure; and my ſmall fund was exhauſted, when accident brought me acquainted with Mr. Roſwell; he found out my circumſtances (and as my pride was now gone; as I no longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered dependance, when it is not the fruits of vice, folly, or indolence, a diſgrace,) he removed all my difficulties; he purchaſed this little man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, furniſhed it, hired me a ſervant, and ſettled an annuity upon me, ſufficient to render me comfortable; I ſhall not need it long, and he will find a rich reward for all his goodneſs; for he is benevolence itſelf. If I can ſoften your troubles, I ſhall be doubly happy; as I am ſure nothing can be more grateful to him. I look back with agony, it is true, but without regret;
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:039134_0236_1013B1E08A78AA00"/>
 and my greateſt miſfortune, gives me ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; for if I have loſt the deareſt, beſt of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, I ſhall leave none to tread the wayward paths that I have; none to encounter the bitter miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, that have been my attendants, through life; or to drink the dregs of ſorrow, that has been ſo copiouſly poured out to me. I look to the grave with joy and ſatisfaction, where I ſhall meet all I have loved here, and ſpend an eternity of joy, without the fear of ſeperation."</p>

               <p>Here ſhe ended; and JULIA with a look of mingled admiration and ſympathy, thanked her for a narrative ſo full of inſtruction, and promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to profit by her example, and to acquieſce with a cheerful reſignation with the will of Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence.</p>

               <p>A FEW days after Madam De Shong had made the above communications of her life and ſorrows, to JULIA, the latter took from her pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et book, the paper that Olivia had given her, the night ſhe left the Chatteau; ſhe recollected that ſhe had deſired her to read it, and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it as directed; it was directed to the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier St. Armand, of the order of the Knights
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:039134_0237_1013B1E22750DD78"/>
of Malta; ſhe heſitated a moment, to whom ſhould ſhe ſend it, or who would convey it to the Chevalier; and recollection told her that Mr. Roſwell would take that care upon himſelf, and ſhe read as follows:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>"The injured St. Armand will undoubtedly be ſurprized, that the wretched Donna Olivia, ſhould addreſs herſelf to him, in preference to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; the man whom ſhe has treated the worſt, is ſurely not the perſon, to be applied to in the hour of diſtreſs; but to whom ſhould the wretched apply, but to thoſe, whoſe ſolemn vows, and generous diſpoſitions have bound to protect and aſſiſt.</p>
                  <p>"Frown not upon me, nor caſt in ſcorn a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per by, becauſe it comes from one who has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done you, and herſelf; to you, ſhe will make all the reparation in her power; to herſelf alas! ſhe can make none; recollect when I came from Spain, the only daughter of a Grandee of that Kingdom, had you been the only one, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed me, I had been happy, for my heart did juſtice to your merit; though my head was dazzled, by the incenſe offered to my vanity; the Duke of Orleans, ſtood foremoſt, and I had the folly to expect to become his wife; it was at this time, that ambition, and vanity tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed over love and reaſon; it was at this time I refuſed the only man, who really loved me, and in purſuit of a phantom, loſt every claim to happineſs.</p>
                  <p>"I will not pretend to deſcribe my feelings, when I received your letter, informing me you had taken the vows, and bid me adieu forever; the change was ſo evident, that it was obſerved;
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:039134_0238_1013B1E5E8663960"/>
  the Duke was diſguſted and left me; but I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained my ſpirits again; plunged into diſſipation, and loſt ſight of every thing praiſe-worthy; years of proſperity flew by like a dream of the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; or like the ſhadows with the ſetting ſun.</p>
                  <p>"At length my father died, and left me pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, but in a ſlender manner; I had been uſed to affluence, to grandeur, and to adulation, I could not live without them, and I did not know of how little eſtimation they are, compared to virtue, and honor.</p>
                  <p>"Chance threw in my way the Count de LAU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NA, and from him I received thoſe praiſes, ſo neceſſary to my exiſtence. My brother died, and all my property was diſſolved, my flatterers left me; my friends deſerted me; and nothing was left but miſery and want upon one ſide, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and the Count on the other; I heſitated, and his fallacious arguments proved my ruin; his ſophiſtry blinded me to the truth, and I fell an infatuated victim, to vice and his baſeneſs.</p>
                  <p>"No time was left me for reflection, 'till I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the Chatteau; until then my ſenſes had been bewildered; I had been blinded by ſhew and magnificence, and the adulation of the Count's friends intirely finiſhed my ruin; but when I commenced my journey; the ſcales be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to fall from my eyes, and a few days after my arrival, the veil was intirely removed, and I beheld the enormities of this wretched, deluded, ſet of men, in their true colours.</p>
                  <p>"You have already heard that the Count DE LAUNA was a principal member of the ſect of Illuminati, he had ſo impoſed upon me, as to perſuade me to become one of the order, and
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:039134_0239_1013B1E9D3978890"/>
  a promiſe of uncommon honor had ſo dazzled me, that I was pleaſed, and impatient until I was inveſted; the day after I came to the Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau, I was with a mock ſolemnity, made acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their tenets, tenets ſo abhorrent to GOD; ſo diſgraceful to man, that I ſhuddered at the recital. They do not believe in GOD, or a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtate; they ſuppoſe all things the work of chance; and all relationſhip is diſſolved; it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and honorable in their opinion to form con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections, that we ſhould think criminal with mothers or ſiſters. It is juſt and prudent, to take away the life of any that offends them; it is bravery to imbrue their hands in the blood of a brother who is ſuſpected; and death is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as an everlaſting ſleep. Theſe are but a ſmall part of their deſtructive ſentiments; it would take whole ſheets to relate the half of them. I revolted at the idea of an oath ſo ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emn as they propoſed, and one week is given me to conſider of it; but a ſolemn feaſt was held to nature, the Goddeſs they adore, and I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted to perſonate that Deity; I heſitated, and aſked what would be required of me? Judge what is my ſurprize, when informed that diſrob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all coverings, except a veſt of ſilver gauze, I am to be expoſed to the homage of all the ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety preſent, upon a marble pedeſtal placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the altar, upon which ſacrifices are to be offered. Though dead to virtue, I was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely loſt to decency, and I refuſed; I bluſh to ſay that one of my attendants appeared as the Goddeſs, and that her behaviour charmed them all.</p>
                  <p>"This ſect increaſes daily; they will in a few
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:039134_0240_1013B1ECD35BD750"/>
  years overturn Europe and lay France in ruins. But I am determined to leave them, and retire to a Convent; I write to caution you and your brave companions, againſt their arts, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt you will get me admittance; I know your generoſity, I know your benevolence, and I throw myſelf upon it; refuſe not this requeſt; but fix upon the order which is moſt ſevere; that I may retire to ſpend the remainder of my days in prayer, and penitence. I ſhall be in Paris in nine days from this, before that the Malteſe fleet will arrive, and you will receive it; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect a line to me, at the Count's houſe in the City, and tell me where I may fly, to bury my ſhame, and guilt in obſcurity, and retirement; Oh think of me, with ſympathy, pity, and forgive the loſt OLIVIA."</p>

moſt active meaſures, to diſcover JULIA; all Paris and its ſuburbs were ſearched, every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in the Kingdom examined; until worn out with unſucceſsful enquiries, they gave up in deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair what appeared ſo vain and fruitleſs; and the Count concluded to viſit his Chatteau, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſe of the death of Leonora, as an argument for his going down at that time; he had for ſome time kept Donna Olivia, and though he ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her in great magnificence, neither his father or aunt knew of his connection; he had held up the tenets of the Illuminati to her view; he had dazzled her underſtanding, and impoſed upon her vanity; but though ſhe ſacrificed to vice, her ſoul bowed to virtue; and when ſhe looked in upon herſelf, ſhe was ſhocked at the folly of her proceedings; ſhe accompanied him to the Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau, and from her arrival, was viewed with jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy and ſuſpicion; they would not confide to her half their ſecrets; until ſhe had taken the oaths, and as ſhe heſitated, they became ſtill more uneaſy; what ſhe had known of them, ſhocked her to the ſoul, and ſhe could not help viewing them as fiends from the infernal regions; and ſhe did not fail to remonſtrate to the Count againſt the iniquity of his proceedings; but tho' the underſtanding of Olivia, was ſuperior to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſhe had by becoming a ſlave to a vicious propenſity, overthrown her own arguments, and ſhe ſaw that he turned from her with diſguſt; ſhe found her once ardent lover, cold, and inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; anxious to diſcover the reaſon; ſhe ſought the cauſe with avidity, and found that JULIA was confined in the houſe; ſhe was no longer ſurprized, and her pity for the unfortunate girl,
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:039134_0242_1013B1F17420B618"/>
was heightened by her admiration of thoſe vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which Philada extolled ſo highly. She was ſenſible of the danger to which ſhe was expoſed, and after laying a plan for her eſcape, retired, and wrote the letter that is mentioned in this chapter, and was haſtening to her apartment when ſhe met her deſcending with Colwort.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as they were gone, ſhe went to the Count, whom ſhe found inſenſible, his arm bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and his temple, which he had ſtruck in his fall, ſwollen to an amazing degree; it was ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hours before he recovered his recollection, and when he did, after conſulting a ſurgeon, who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him in no danger; he enquired for JULIA and her deliverer, when informed of their eſcape, his rage knew no bounds, and ſummoning ſome of his aſſociates, they took different routs in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of the fugitives. COLWORT they overtook, and conveyed to a private priſon. JULIA eſcaped them, though ſome of them delivered an order in the name of the Counteſs, that ſhe ſhould not be admitted at the Villa; while a party laid wait for the unprotected girl; this part of their ſcheme was rendered abortive, by the humane care of Mr. Roſwell, and they retired to the Chatteau with an account of their achievement.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, Jaques faithful to his prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſe, had delivered JULIA'S letter to the Counteſs; who read with amazement its contents, and hearing from Jaques every circumſtance that had occured at the Chatteau, took him into her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and then accompanied by the Marquis, and a retinue too numerous to fear the Count, and his myrmidons ſet out for the retreat of the Count; they travelled with all the expedition that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:039134_0243_1013B1F425448AE8"/>
of the Marquis would permit; but when within a few leagues of the end of their journey, were met by a meſſenger, who informed them that the unhappy man, was at the point of death, they puſhed forward, and arrived but a few hours before the cloſing of a life, filled with guilt and iniquity. The change in the Count was obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed directly after the return of thoſe who went in purſuit of JULIA, and COLWORT; and was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by an accident, that proves the retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Providence. The Count had always kept with him the doctor, who, officiated at the illneſs of his mother in law; he had adminiſtered the cordial that quickened her paſſage from ſcenes of mortality and pain, to thoſe of joy unfading; finding it neceſſary to open a vein; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the loſs of blood had been great, he applied by miſtake a lancet diped in a moſt deadly poiſon; his whole maſs of blood was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and ſymptoms of approaching death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; the doctor's agitation betrayed his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and he applied every art of medicine, in vain; it was then that his aſſociates, his falſely named friends, left him; but his ſervants ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſurgeon, until the Marquis ſhould arrive. He was then left only to the unfortunate Olivia, and his ſervants. The deſertion of theſe people ſeemed to convince him of his errors; he begged Olivia to write the Marquis; to intreat he would haſten to him, for indeed he had a dreadful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to ſettle with him. This unhappy woman obeyed his directions; and was ſurprized to find they arrived ſo much ſooner than they could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.</p>
               <p>She left the Count in a partial ſleep, and met
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:039134_0244_1013B1F5C3D18618"/>
them in the parlour, the Counteſs was ſurprized to find her there; and her diſtreſs and confuſion told them how much ſhe felt her humiliating ſtate; in a conciſe manner, ſhe told them the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents that had ſhortened the life of the Count, and as ſoon as he awaked, they went to his bed chamber, were they found him in his laſt ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; he ſtretched out his hand to his father; begged his forgiveneſs for all his vices; owned they had been many, and aggravated; lamented his early departure from virtue; his connection with her oppoſite, and attributed it to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and pernicious doctrine of the vile ſect with whom he had aſſociated; he begged every one would leave the room, but his father, his aunt, and Philada, and when his requeſt was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with, he began to remark the retribution of that power, whoſe exiſtence he had denied; who had choſen that very hand, as the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his death, that he had employed to fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh the days of the amiable Marchioneſs, while the Marquis heard this recital, his agony and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itation was ſo great, that his unhappy ſon became more bewildered; he was forced to take a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial, and when he endeavoured to proceed, he was evidently dying, his voice was thick and difficult to be underſtood; but the name of the Marchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſs, was again pronounced, of a child, and of a ſervant; at length he found he could not make himſelf intelligent, he ſtopped as if to recollect himſelf, and then added, I am too weak to ſay what I wiſh; ſend to the houſe of Monſieur Nancrede in Paris; there is confined a woman, whoſe teſtimony is true, believe her; confide in her; ſhe will unravel a ſcene of iniquity; ſhe
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:039134_0245_1013B1F9A5812A70"/>
will direct you to find a loſt—his words died upon his lips; he fell into convulſions, and died without pronouncing another ſyllable.</p>
               <p>When they ſaw he was really gone; the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy father with the Counteſs retired into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther apartment, and left the wretched remains to the care of his domeſtics.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as he was interred, which ceremony was performed without pomp or parade; the Marquis prepared to examine the doctor, but he had eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped amidſt the general confuſion; Donna Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via now urged them to ſend to Paris, as ſhe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured them that ſome important ſecret, hung up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the releaſe of a woman whom the Count had ſince his confinement, ſeveral times mentioned; and had aſſured her that ſhe had been confined ſeveral years; at the ſame time ſhe gave ſuch an account of the deliverer of JULIA, as convinced them it was Colwort; upon inquiry of the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the priſon, not a doubt remained; and they ſought to find out the place of his confinement; determined to releaſe and make him happy. As for JULIA they did not heſitate to ſuppoſe ſhe was at the Villa, and the Counteſs ſent off a ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, to inform her of all that had happened at the Chatteau; but the man returned in a few days, with an account of her having been denied admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and that they had heard nothing of her ſince; this was diſtreſſing to the affectionate heart of the Marquis and his ſiſter; who feared ſhe was betrayed again into the hands of the Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nati; and both entertained ſo dreadful an idea of this ſect, that they dreaded the thoughts of her ſufferings and danger.</p>
               <p>Within a few days the perſon who had been
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:039134_0246_1013B1FD7733E988"/>
ſent to Paris, returned with intelligence from Monſieur Nancrede, that the woman who had been intruſted to his care, had corrupted the man who attended upon her, and with him made her eſcape; thus was a ſecret of apparent great import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, ſtill enveloped in clouds of myſtery; this perplexed and diſtreſſed the Marquis and his ſiſter; the former of whom was now bending be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the accumulated weight of ſorrow and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, and the latter ſuffering all the pains of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere friendſhip for a beloved object.</p>
               <p>Several weeks paſſed off in this manner, when one afternoon a ſervant informed the Counteſs, that a young Engliſhman wiſhed to ſpeak to her. The ſervant added a ſecond time, he is an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhman, Madam, and the Counteſs whoſe imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination dwelt upon JULIA and Colwort, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſuppoſed it muſt be him; ſhe ordered him to be admitted, and the moment he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the door, ſhe ſaw indeed that it was not her young friend; ſhe was diſappointed, for though his air was elegant, his perſon genteel, and his countenance expreſſive, and prepoſſeſſing, it bore no reſemblance of her deliverer; with a ſigh of chagrin, ſhe aſked his buſineſs; I have preſumed to wait upon you, Madam, in behalf of a very lovely, but a very unfortunate young woman; could I flatter myſelf my embaſſy, would be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, I ſhould be very happy. If unfortunate in other reſpects, (ſaid the Counteſs,) ſhe has been fortunate, in her ambaſſador, for I am convinced I cannot deny any thing to your intreaties. I have been taught to expect every thing from your philanthropy, Madam, and I am convinced miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune never ſued in vain. The writer of this
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:039134_0247_1013B1FEF8C0EE40"/>
letter, (he ſaid, and he laid it upon the table by her, bowing). The eye of the Counteſs was caught by the direction, ſurely, ſurely I am not deceived (ſaid ſhe,) it is the character of my beloved JULIA; it is indeed, (ſaid Roſwell,) for it was himſelf, the character of the amiable JULIA VALLACE, and it is upon her account, that I wait upon you. She needs no interceſſion, ſhe cried, as ſhe opened the letter, and I thank heaven that I have a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of ſeeing my amiable friend again; tell me ſir; tell me where ſhe is, and where I ſhall find her; my arms, my heart, are open to receive her.—This will be a rich, a reviving cordial to her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted ſpirit, (cried Roſwell) I will haſten on the wings of impatience, to bear theſe tidings of joy. Amiable young man, (ſaid the Counteſs) how I venerate the warmth, the generoſity of your feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; but I will read, what ſhe ſays, I am ſure you will excuſe me. In peruſing this letter of JULIA'S, the tears of the Counteſs bore witneſs of her affection. When ſhe ended, ſhe made a thouſand enquiries of Roſwell, and though he ſpake with modeſty of his own ſervices, yet he painted her diſtreſs in true colours. Madam DE LAUNA expreſed her gratitude, for his goodneſs and explained the treachery that had given the appearance of cruelty to any part of her conduct; She then aſked if he had been ſucceſsful, with reſpect to Colwort Roſewell informed her that he ſhould have been with her three weeks ſince, but for an alarming indiſpoſition with which he was ſeized upon his journey; that he had made every poſſible ſearch for his countryman, hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to without ſucceſs; but if he was aided by her and the Marquis, he had no doubt but his next
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:039134_0248_1013B201A253C010"/>
attempts would be more effectual. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs aſſured him of every poſſible aſſiſtance from herſelf and brother; and when the Marquis came in, informed him of the pleaſing buſineſs of Roſwell, and preſented him as the deliverer of JULIA. The venerable man received him with every expreſſion of regard, and gratitude; and Roſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well found by his manner as well as looks, how dear JULIA was to him. They concluded to ſet out the next morning for the habitation of Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am De Shong, as they both declared that they would run no farther riſque of diſappointment, to themſelves; or of her ſafety, by truſting her in leſs affectionate, or leſs intereſted hands, than their own.</p>

               <p>WE will now return to JULIA, whoſe fate ſeemed to draw towards a criſis, dreadful indeed! For two of the four weeks, that Roſwell had been abſent, ſhe and her venerable friend had looked for him, with increaſing impatience. When they beheld the ſun ariſe in the morning, they hoped, that he with them, would greet its exit;
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:039134_0249_1013B2038E3A1700"/>
but every evening brought a new diſappointment. For every morning found them fluſhed with hope.</p>
               <p>Working and reading divided their time; and converſation ſupplied every interval, with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing new and intereſting. After ſitting up late one night, and talking over again, every topic that they loved to dwell on; they retired to their ſeperate apartments, and a gentle ſlumber, had ſealed up their ſenſes, when they were awoke by the cry of fire. JULIA, who was firſt alarmed by finding her apartment enveloped in flames, which had caught the curtains, that were around the bed, ſprang up, and ruſhed immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through the fire, into Madam DE SHONG'S room; ſhe had preſence of mind, to pull too the door, and though that and every other apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was in a blaze, it had not reached the chamber of her hoſteſs, who was that moment arouſed by the ſmoke, and the cries of the people without, who were juſt collected.</p>
               <p>JULIA ſaw ſhe was bewildered, and beſought her to get up, and endeavour to ſave herſelf; the little Maria was running about, in great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs; and a perſon entered the window, by a ladder; come Madamoiſelle, (he cried,) we will ſave you; truſt yourſelf to me. Not before Madam DE SHONG, has eſcaped the fire (ſaid JULIA with firmneſs) ſave yourſelf, my dear children, (cried the old lady;) my life is nearly at an end; your's is juſt beginning. The perſon declared, this was no time for argument, and as he found JULIA would not go, until her friend was ſafe, with the aſſiſtance of a young, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive man, he lifted her from the window, and in a
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:039134_0250_1013B2088F415D70"/>
moment ſhe was upon the ground; JULIA next inſiſted that Maria, ſhould deſcend the ladder; and though frighted, the little girl was too active to need much aſſiſtance; a young gentleman who had before perſuaded JULIA to go down, caught her in his arms, and forced her from the window, and in leſs than a minute the roof ſunk in. The maid ſervant who laid below ſtairs had awaked the firſt, ſhe had attempted to aſcend the ſtairs, to inform thoſe above, but found the ſtaircaſe an intire body of fire; ſhe then alarmed the neighbourhood, with her cries, and though every one was ſafe, not one article of cloathing, or furniture, was preſerved from this moſt devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing element.</p>
               <p>The young man, who had at the riſque of his own life ſaved that of JULIA, ſtill ſtood by her, he had wrapped her in a large cloak of his own; for ſhe was only habited in her night cloaths, and by every ſoothing attention, endeavored to keep her ſpirits from fainting; but her concern was wholly occupied by Madam, and ſhe ſeemed to loſe every perſonal concern, in her anxiety for her.</p>
               <p>The confuſion had in ſome meaſure ſubſided, and they were carried into a neighbouring houſe and put to bed; but the moſt painful ideas, drove off every thought of ſleep; Madam reflected that perhaps ſome accident, had happened to Roſwell which might prevent his return, and that in this helpleſs, unfriended ſtate, ſhe ſhould be left to ſuffer all the evils attendant upon poverty, and old age. JULIA'S reflections were not of a more pleaſing nature; ſhe recollected that but for her, Mr. Roſwell would have been with them at the
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:039134_0251_1013B20B4EBDF0E8"/>
time of this dreadful accident; and that perhaps the ſpark that caught the houſe, had fell from her candle; her purſe that was by no means ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted had fallen a prey to the fire, and her cloaths had periſhed with it. This laſt want, was ſupplied the next morning by the charity of ſome neighbours, and for ſeveral days their kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was continued; but it then ſeemed to ceaſe, and every hour their impatience to hear from Roſwell increaſed; the fifth day after their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, the young gentleman who had ſaved JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIA, called upon them, and after lamenting the evil to which he had been a witneſs, expreſſed his admiration of the young lady, and without any heſitation propoſed that they ſhould all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide with him, at his houſe which was large and convenient. While Madam and JULIA expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their gratitude for this offer, which the latter was about to accept, when he turned to JULIA and with an aſſurance unequalled, offered to ſettle an annuity upon her for life, and take the care of her friend, and the little girl upon himſelf, if ſhe would conſent to live with him as a miſtreſs.</p>
               <p>Her aſtoniſhment at this affrontive propoſal, aroſe to anger that ſhe had never felt before, and in the moſt ſpirited terms ſhe refuſed him, and told him that ſhe ſhould in future value her life much leſs than ſhe had ever done before, becauſe it had been ſaved by a man, that ſhe ſo ſincerely deſpiſed; ſhe concluded by deſiring him to leave the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and Madam repeated her commands, in a void of decided authority, that was not to be trifled with.</p>
               <p>He had but juſt left them, when the perſon to whom the houſe belonged, entered, and informed
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:039134_0252_1013B20D0FC6AE58"/>
them that they muſt quit the apartment that very night, as they expected ſome friends that rendered it neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Madam was really ſick, and JULIA knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the neighbourhood; they knew not what to do, nor which way to turn when Calliſta, the girl, who had lived with Madam, and who was much attached to her, called to ſee them, ſhe reſided with her ſiſter, who occupied only one room; and ſupported herſelf by labour; this girl told them ſhe believed they could get lodgings, or at leaſt a room, for a few days, at a tavern, about a mile from their old reſidence.—It was now afternoon, and JULIA accompanied by Calliſta, walked immediately there; ſhe tried ſeveral houſes on the way, but met with no ſucceſs, and when ſhe arrived, found herſelf ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued, as convinced her the diſtance muſt be treble what ſhe had been informed. She told the tavern-keeper, that they expected a friend who would pay all their expences, and that if any thing ſhould prevent his coming, Madam would ſend to her banker, at Paris, for her annuity, which would become due in a month. The man made many objections, but at laſt her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions, aided by the intreaties of Calliſta, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed; and he ſet out in a chaiſe, for Madam, who immediately leſt the houſe ſhe was at, and arrived juſt as it grew dark; JULIA who had not returned, had buſied herſelf in preparing the apartment, which was up two pair of ſtairs, was ſurprized to find Maria was not with her, and heard with much ſatiſfaction, that a perſon who lived near, had invited the little girl to ſpend a week with their children, who were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:039134_0253_1013B20FC2CF44D0"/>
her age; this leſſened their expences, and JULIA aſſured Madam of her alacrity, in ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the want of an attendant.</p>
               <p>For ſeveral days, they were ſupplied with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions from the landlord's table; but after that the reſource failed, and JULIA who began to be apprehenſive of extreme want, propoſed to Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, that ſhe would walk to a Convent, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to procure ſome employ, for ſhe had tried in vain, in the neighbourhood, and every perſon was obliged to do their own work. The walk was long and tireſome, and when JULIA inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Abbeſs of her ſituation, that lady, though liberal of her advice, refuſed her any employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſuffered her to depart, without that refreſhment, of which ſhe certainly ſtood in need.</p>
               <p>She had ſcarcely ſet forward on her return, when ſhe was overtaken by the very man, whoſe inſolence had ſo added to her affliction, and ſo much offended her; ſhe ſtarted when he joined her, and was irreſolute whether to return, or go on, but reflection told her that it was not proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he would inſult her on her way; ſhe kept forward, and gave no anſwer to his inquiries, until the began to aſk her pardon, for the inſult he had dared to offer her, in his late viſit. JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIA then told him, if he really wiſhed her to think of him with leſs anger than ſhe then did, he muſt leave her, as ſhe could not enter into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny converſation with a man who had treated her ſo ill; but he replied he was then on his way to find her, to offer her all the reparation in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; I have been wretched, ſince I left you (ſaid he,) that I dared to inſult ſo much virtue and delicacy; and as I can never love or honor any
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:039134_0254_1013B213A08F9628"/>
woman as I do you, I have now come to beg you will accept my hand, and become the partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of that ample fortune, which Providence has beſtowed upon me; he heſitated and JULIA loſt her anger, but with firmneſs ſhe informed him, that her vows of tenderneſs and fidelity, had long been given to another; and if they were ſtill divided by that fate that had been ſo cruel to them, ſhe ſhould never tranſfer her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to another; but ſhe ſhould always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his propoſals as an honor that ſhe ſhould reflect upon with pleaſure; as it convinced her, her conduct had not been reprehenſible. He then lamented his attachment, but begged, tho' ſhe could not love him, ſhe would give him a claim upon her eſteem, and oblige him by accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that aſſiſtance of which he was ſure ſhe ſtood in need; he beſought her with ſo much earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to accept at leaſt a temporary ſupply, that for a moment her wants and thoſe of her venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble friend, made her heſitate; but prudence got the better, and with a grateful but modeſt firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhe refuſed every aſſiſtance, however trifling. He appeared diſtreſſed at her refuſal, and left her, chagrined and unhappy; a conſciouſneſs of having done her duty, now became her only ſupport; before ſhe arrived at her temporary abode, the weather became tempeſtuous, and night came on with additional horror and darkneſs. She went immediately to her friend whom ſhe found faint for want of nouriſhment, as ſhe had not taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for the day; this was likewiſe the caſe with JULIA; and her walk had ſo exhauſted her, that it was with difficulty ſhe could go through the unpleaſing taſk of relating her ill ſucceſs; but tho'
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:039134_0255_1013B2152262CF88"/>
ſick and faint to the heart, Madam held her hand with tenderneſs to her lips, embraced her with affection, and aſſured her that her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct had been exactly conſiſtent with female de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum.</p>
               <p>For ſome time, they converſed upon their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy ſituation, and endeavoured to inſpire each other, with that fortitude which was ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; when a girl who attended at the Hotel came up for ſome chairs, for Madamoiſelle (ſaid ſhe) we have a power of company below; we may thank the ſtorm for that however. JULIA then recollected a miniature picture, that her mother had hung around her neck when quite a child, it was richly ſet in gold, and ſurrounded by two rows of diamonds; ſhe looked at it for a moment, her own wants however preſſing, would never have tempted her to part with it, but when ſhe reflected that Madam DE SHONG was really ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for hunger, ſhe took it from her neck, and preſſing it to her lips, with a deep drawn ſigh, ſhe followed the girl out of the chamber, and putting it in her hand, requeſted her to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to diſpoſe of it to ſome of the gueſts below. The girl who really pitied them, and whoſe heart was truly ſympathetic, looked at JULIA'S pale face with tears, and delivering her a candle which ſhe was carrying away, aſſured her ſhe would ſell it to the beſt advantage, and return to her immediately.</p>
               <p>JULIA returned to the chamber, with the light, and upon the inquiries of her friend was obliged to confeſs what ſhe had done; tho' Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam felt the full force of the ſacrifice JULIA had made, yet ſhe could not wiſh her to recall it,
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:039134_0256_1013B217CECE2940"/>
and liſtened with a palpitating heart for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of their meſſenger.</p>
               <p>The girl went directly to the room that was appropriated to the gueſts, and having ſet down the chairs, advanced to a lady, who ſat with a gentleman by the fire, and who was examining with critical ſcrutiny the face of an old gentleman and a lady, who had juſt entered; a young man was buſied with ſeveral attendants, in getting refreſhments, and wiping the wet from the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's habit. But when the girl preſented the picture and begged to know if none of their hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors would pleaſe to buy it; ſhe held out her hand, and having examined it for a moment, and turning a ſpring diſcovered two miniatures inſtead of one, and with a kind of frantic aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment demanded to ſee the perſon, who ſent it, as ſhe was ſure it was ſtolen; the girl declared the innocence of the young lady, who had, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired her to ſell it, and after ſome time offered to conduct her to the chamber; and the gentlemen declared they would accompany them, with a view to ſuccor that diſtreſs, that the girl had in ſimple, but pathetic language, delineated.</p>
               <p>It would be impoſſible to deſcribe the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the whole party, upon entering the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the affrighted girl whoſe ſprightly activity left the others far behind her, entered juſt time to ſay, that a lady with a great many others were coming up to ſecure JULIA as a thief, and was ſure, the picture was ſtolen.</p>
               <p>JULIA was ſupported by a conſciouſneſs of her innocence; but Madam already weak, almoſt fainted with apprehenſions; and JULIA on her knees at the bed ſide begged her to be compoſed, and held a ſmelling bottle to her noſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="unknown:039134_0257_1013B21A917F1488"/>
In this affecting ſituation, pale as death, and her heart throbbing with a variety of ſenſations; in a mean chamber almoſt without furniture, her eyes fixed upon her almoſt dying friend, JULIA heeded not the entrance of the ſtrangers, but in a moment the ſilver toned voice of Roſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, caught her ear. Good Heavens, (he cried) what do I ſee, Madam DE SHONG, JULIA VAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LACE? What has brought you here, why have you left …. but before he proceeded, the Counteſs held JULIA faſt locked in her arms, and called her by all the tendereſt names, that love and friendſhip could dictate. Half frantic with joy, her emotions became too powerful, and preſſing the Counteſs to her boſom, ſhe faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Madam was nearly in the ſame ſituation, and the humane maid declared they were both dying for want of food, as they had eat nothing for near two days. Roſwell, almoſt diſtracted, flew down ſtairs and returned in a moment, with ſome cake and cordial from the coach; JULIA was now recovering, and the perſuaſions of the Counteſs prevailed on her to take a bit of the cake, and drink ſome of the liquor. Madam was ſupplied by Roſwell, who with all the tenderneſs of a ſon, whole boſom glowed with a fond and reſpectful affection towards an indulgent mother, perſuaded her to take the refreſhment he had brought.</p>
               <p>In leſs than half an hour, they became com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed enough to communicate the cauſe of their removal, and the Counteſs declared it the work of Heaven, for if the ſtorm had not obliged them to ſeek a ſhelter at the Inn, they ſhould not have ſtopped until they arrived at the lately deſtroyed
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:039134_0258_1013B21EAD6CFF70"/>
dwelling, and they ſhould not have found them until morning, when help in all probability would have come too late.</p>
               <p>JULIA now began to recollect the cauſe of their being together, and deſired to ſee her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer, and that her miniature might be returned, the lady who had ſtood quite back, but who had obſerved all that had happened, now came for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Tell me, (ſaid ſhe,) if JULIA does not remember the woman who protected her as a mother; who ſaved her infant life, and who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted herſelf to her and ….. but before ſhe could finiſh the ſentence, JULIA exclaimed, it is my mother! good Heavens it is my mother! and ſhe ſunk upon her knees before her; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you, Oh yes! and rejoice to ſee you; rejoice that you are reſtored to me. The lady embraced her with tears and affection. I am my dear and honored young lady, (ſaid ſhe) not your mother; ſhe has long ſince fallen a victim to cruelty and vice; but I can reſtore you to a parent that deſerves ſo great a bleſſing; here, ſir, (ſaid ſhe) turning to the Marquis, I reſtore to you a daughter, the daughter of your much lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Marchioneſs, who with her dying breath, bade me preſerve her for you. Surely, (ſaid the Marquis) you deceive me; I can never be ſo bleſt, I never had a daughter. I do not deceive you, (ſaid the woman,) as ſure as you ſtand there, this young lady is your daughter. Look at me, ſir, view me well, has twenty years ſo altered me, that you have forgotten that Iſabella, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed your beloved Marchioneſs from Italy.—What, (cried the Marquis,) are you indeed that faithful Iſabella, whom my wife eſteemed ſo
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:039134_0259_1013B2202F539DA8"/>
much; Oh! I no longer doubt, and with grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and joy, I embrace the bleſſing that you preſerved for me; but how preſerved, I cannot yet divine; my lovely daughter, come to the arms of a fond, and affectionate parent; whoſe greateſt bleſſings are comprized in you. JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIA embraced her father with a tranſport that was new to her heart, but ſo pleaſing, ſo exquiſite, that ſhe would not have exchanged it, for all the joys of the ſenſualiſt, and all the riches of the Eaſt. It was not that ſhe knew herſelf the daughter of a Nobleman of the firſt wealth and reſpectabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Kingdom; but that ſhe had found a parent, whoſe virtue had rendered him beloved and eſteemed by all. That ſhe could attend to him all hours; watch his declining years, and ſooth the infirmities of old age; it was this, that gave ſo ſincere a joy to her heart; that her tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port defied the power of expreſſion; that ſhe could claim as a right the protection of thoſe friends who loved her as ſuch, before they knew of her relationſhip; her boſom had been ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed to ſenſations delightful as theſe, that now ruſhed in a full tide of proſperity upon her, that it needed the abatement of not ſeeing COLWORT amongſt the friends that now ſurrounded her; to prevent its effects being too ſtrong, too mighty, to be ſupported; but wonder and aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment ſuſpended for a while, the tranſports of all.</p>
               <p>The Counteſs was the firſt to aſk an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation; ſhe did not doubt the truth, the pleaſing truth, but ſhe wiſhed to know by what wonderful means this daughter, had been preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſhe recollected the countenance of Iſabella,
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:039134_0260_1013B222DC9FAAD0"/>
and after embracing JLUIA, as a lovely and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved neice, ſhe begged that her curioſity might be ſatisfied. I will with pleaſure obey you, Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, after the tumults of this dear child's heart have ſubſided; I think the attendant declares that neither ſhe nor this venerable woman, have taken any nouriſhment for twenty-four hours; until the ſlight one that has been preſented; and though her agitated ſpirits are now inſenſible to every thing but joy, at finding friends ſo beloved; yet nature muſt be exhauſted. After ſupper, which is now preparing, I will unfold all my ſtory, by that time, we ſhall all be more compoſed; more fitted to receive ſome alloy, than we are at preſent.</p>
               <p>Every one approved of her motion, and they went immediately below; Madam DE SHONG felt the renovation of her youth, and deſired to be aſſiſted down, if what was to be told was not a ſecret. The Marquis declared that he ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, and revered her character, that he had not a wiſh to conceal any thing from her; and Roſwell, with all the nervous ſtrength of youth, and the tenderneſs of an amiable heart, without difficulty, aſſiſted her below ſtairs.</p>
               <p>When ſeated at the ſupper table, JULIA look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed around her, with tearful eyes, and an happy heart, her ſenſations were ſo exquiſite; preſſed by her father to partake of this or that little del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icacy; that ſhe aſked if it was indeed real, that ſhe was ſo bleſt! ſo happy!</p>

               <p>WHEN the cloth was removed, the huſband of Iſabella reminded her of her promiſe, and ſhe began as follows:</p>
               <q>  
                  <p>"You will, ſir, recollect with what reluctance, my lady parted from you, when you were order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Court of Spain; you had been gone but a few days when the Baron dared to inſult her with a declaration of love; my lady's heart was almoſt broken by his impiety; ſhe immediately wrote to you, but the letter never reached you, and ſhe behaved with ſo much ſpirit, that the Baron deſpairing of obtaining his wiſhes, was affronted, his love was turned into hate, and he vowed revenge; my poor lady, was ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his domeſtics, and I ſaw was apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of her life; ſhe could confide in none, but Philada and me, and never ſuffered us both to be out of her preſence, at a time; one day being much indiſpoſed,—Iſabella (ſaid ſhe,) if I ſhould die, without ſeeing the Marquis, as I think I ſhall, and leave a child behind me, ſwear to me that you will protect that child; that you will preſerve her from the malice of the Baron; that you will never deliver her into any hands but the Marquis, or the Counteſs DE LAUNA; but run no riſque of her falling into the power of the Baron; it will ſtand between him, and vaſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions,
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:039134_0262_1013B229520BC810"/>
  and he will ſtop at nothing, to put the little orphan out of the way; I took the oath ſhe required, and ſhe put into my care two caſkets of rich jewels, with the miniature of your lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and herſelf, which you had cauſed to be fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together by a ſpring, when you courted her. My poor lady was a true propheteſs for that very night, ſhe was delivered of a daughter, and died in a few hours after. Philada who loved her with a faithful affection, was ſo ſhocked at her illneſs, that ſhe was ſeized with fits; no one was near her, but myſelf, and I was perſuaded that her death was occaſioned by a cordial with ſome drug, that a phyſician of the Baron, had prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; of this I was convinced, by a converſation that I heard between them; and I then diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered that the infant's life would the next morning be ſacrificed, as well as the mother's, as the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor promiſed to put it to ſleep before the Count and Counteſs DE LAUNA could be appriſed of this event. I looked at the little creature, then aſleep in my lap, and while I wept over it, I vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſave it if poſſible; I had no time to loſe, the old valet was honeſt, in him I could confide, and aſſiſted by him, I that night left the Chatteau, and conveyed my infant charge to a Cottage, a few leagues diſtant; we knew that we were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe; we could not reach the Counteſs DE LAU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NA, without certain ruin; we retired to a greater diſtance and in a large foreſt, in the hoſpitable Cottage of a worthy pair, we became boarders. It was ſeveral months, before I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to make any inquiries; I then found that the late Count DE LAUNA was dead; that the Counteſs was diſtracted, and that the Marquis
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:039134_0263_1013B22C00897B50"/>
  was ſtill in Spain; that the Baron had taken the title of Count DE LAUNA, and that it was report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and believed, my infant charge had died with her mother. This reſolved me to continue where I was, which I did until JULIA was ſixteen years old; I then thought it was time to find her friends, and I left my retreat; my inquiries for you and the Counteſs betrayed me; and the perſon, in whom I had in ſome meaſure confided, was one that was employed by the Count; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned as uſual to the Cottage, fluſhed with the news; that I heard I was indeed ſo impoſed upon, that I had nearly ruined myſelf by telling JULIA, and the perſon that deceived me, the ſecret of her birth, and retreat; I had always paſſed as her mother, and called the faithful valet my father; but I was now ſo impatient to tell the dear girl, who ſhe really was, that nothing but a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it might eventually injure her, prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I left her with the aſſurance, that all ſhould be unravelled the next day, and with a charge not to leave the Cottage. I forgot to mention that upon the death of the old people who owned the Cottage, we ſold the jewels, and purchaſed it, this happened when JULIA was but two years old. Upon my arrival at the houſe, I had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to meet my informer, I was ſeized by ſeveral men and threatened with death, if I did not diſcover where the child was, that I had ſtol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in her infancy; but I bid defiance to their threats and was proof againſt their perſuaſions; I was carried to the Count's Chatteau, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined there, for two years; every artifice was uſed to tempt me to diſcover where my treaſure was; wealth, honors, and power were promiſed, if I
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:039134_0264_1013B22D828CBD90"/>
  gave her up; but on the contrary, perpetual im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, with famine, and filth was the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries that ſhould attend me through life, if I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed. But I ſcorned them all, and in the end triumphed; one thing I ſucceeded in, which was having an advertiſement inſerted, in ſeveral of the public papers, which I had written with a view to quiet the fears of JULIA; a crown pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on one of my gaolers to ſend it to the printers, and he was removed from his care of me, upon its being diſcovered.</p>
                  <p>The education I had given JULIA, had taught her, to conquer her curioſity, to employ all her time, to be reſigned and contented, in all ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; I had taught her to reverence the Deity, to obey his commands; to do all the good ſhe poſſibly could to her fellow creatures. I knew theſe principles were ſo engraven upon her heart, that miſfortunes could not ſhake them, nor bad example eraſe them. I knew her temper was ſweet and mild; her diſpoſition, ſoft, juſt, and humane. I knew that her mind was filled with noble and refined ſentiments; that ſhe had a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of heart; a rectitude of thought ſeldom to be met with; that ſhe had real fortitude, and not one particle of pride or vanity; reflecting upon her virtues, ſo like her mother's, gave me comfort. The old valet was as good, as honeſty itſelf, he was old, but healthy, and I doubted not that ſhe would be reſtored to her friends and me.</p>
                  <p>At the end of two years, two painful ſolitary years, I was removed from the Chatteau to Paris; this gentleman was appointed to take care of me; he pitied my misfortunes; the tranſition from pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to love, is ſmall; we ſoon contracted a mutual
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:039134_0265_1013B22F049AAA48"/>
  attachment, and I promiſed to become his wife, if he would effect my eſcape; we ſucceeded, and retired for a few weeks from the kingdom; but before we left France, the holy prieſt joined our hands; in a very ſhort time my huſband receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a letter, informing him of the death of the Count DE LAUNA, and of the ſearch that the Marquis had made for me, as my motives for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment were at an end, and I wiſhed for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, than to inform you, my Lord, of the circumſtances that I have now related; and if poſſible, preſent your daughter to you; we ſet off for France immediately, and were on our way to the Villa, when I heard in Paris you were gone, the ſtorm obliged us to take ſhelter here, and here my purſuit is ended, for I have here found the dear object of my hopes; and found her juſt what I wiſhed her, riſing ſuperior to miſfortunes, and eſcaped from the ſnares that vice and perfidy had laid for her, and in reſigning her to you, my Lord, as a rich bleſſing, I ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the dying commands of my beloved and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected lady."</p>
               </q>
               <p>Here Iſabella finiſhed her narrative, which had ſhe followed the dictates of her own heart, ſhe would have rendered it more lengthy and affecting; but in pity to the Marquis, ſhe ſurpreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many circumſtances, that ſhe knew would on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerve to diſtreſs him. But the intelligence, excepting what related to JULIA, was not new to him; Philada had before given her opinion, and indeed the Count's confeſſion, had rendered the matter certain. The Marquis could never think of his wife's untimely end, without grief of heart, nor of his ſon, without agony; yet to find a
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:039134_0266_1013B23428864868"/>
daughter, the exact reſemblance of her mother, who inherited with it all her beauties, her virtues, and her accompliſhments, was a balm, to his wounded heart, and ſoothed all his ſorrows; he embraced her, with tears of tender love, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, her he found in her, a rich reward for all his ſufferings. And then turning to the faithful woman, who had thus preſerved her; it is not in my power, (ſaid he,) to repay the debt I owe you, for your unceaſing love, to my amiable, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented wife; and for preſerving this ineſtimable treaſure, my child; but I ſhall conſider you, and your huſband, as my beſt friends, and will as ſoon as I arrive at my ſiſters, make ſuch a ſettlement as ſhall ſecure eaſe and affluence to yourſelves and heirs. And you Madam, (ſaid he) addreſſing himſelf to Madam De Shong, may from this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment bid adieu to every difficulty, that wealth can remove. Stop, ſtop, my good brother, (ſaid the Counteſs) and do not in your joy diſcover ſo engroſſing a diſpoſition, I demand this venerable, and worthy woman, as my ſhare of bleſſings, ſhe ſhall have an equal right with myſelf to ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery thing I poſſeſs; and I requeſt that ſhe will leave this village with us tomorrow, to reſide with me, an honored friend, and reſpected com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion; I ſhall conſider myſelf accountable for the education, and fortune of her grand-daughter. Ah my friends, (cried Madam) how greatly is my old age bleſſed, beyond my deſert, or expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. I ſhall grow too fond of life; but I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be grateful to you all, and grateful to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven who has given you wealth and hearts to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it ſo beneficial to your fellow creatures.—But (ſaid Roſwell) I find I am to be cheated intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:039134_0267_1013B236DE6BFE90"/>
and you Madam are looking out for others to make happy, and quite neglect your poor coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman; but I acquieſce, and rejoice in this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral joy. A joy, (replied JULIA) we ſhould never have known but for you, and amidſt all theſe friends, ſo honoured, ſo beloved, and to whom I am ſo obliged, not one has a ſtronger claim on my gratitude, and eſteem; for I was an outcaſt, and you took me in; diſtreſſed, and you relieved me; afflicted, and you comforted me; but tho' I want words to ſpeak my gratitude of all theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, yet my heart feels all, and is now burſting with a ſenſe of them.</p>
               <p>But we muſt leave a converſation, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give at full length, and let the imagination conceive the feelings that cannot be deſcribed. It was late when they parted for the night; and when JULIA laid her head upon the pillow, a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of contending ſenſations, concurred to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent reſt. Her joy that ſhe had found a father, noble, rich, and worthy, whoſe heart was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing with tenderneſs towards her; that ſhe had in the Counteſs met a friend that had long loved her as a child, and was happy to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge her as a kinſwoman, who approved of all her conduct, and cleared her of the ſhadow of blame. She had found too the woman, who had been a mother to her in her infancy, who had ſaved her life, and had implanted in her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom the love of virtue, and hatred of vice. The wealth of her father put it in her power, to repay every favor ſhe had received; to aſſiſt the poor; to comfort the afflicted; and to cheer the aching heart; but amidſt all theſe new found bleſſings, ſhe was unhappy, and ſhe found that in the arms
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:039134_0268_1013B23860496180"/>
of affluence, in the lap of luxury, and in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of benevolence, ſhe could be wretched; for COLWORT was not found; he was probably ſuffering a rigorous confinement, that his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for her had occaſioned; and perhaps death would be the ſad, the dreadful conſequence; theſe reflections prevented her enjoyment, and with a ſigh, ſhe acknowledged ſhe could never know quiet.</p>

               <p>EARLY the next forenoon, they left the Village, after ſatisfying every demand, that could be made upon Madam De Shong; and JULIA liberally rewarded the humanity of the girl, who had preſented the picture for ſale, and whoſe feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were ſo powerfully operated upon, by the ſufferings of herſelf and friend; the old maid ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, who had been much attached to her miſtreſs, was again taken into her ſervice, and followed in a carriage, with the waiting woman of the Count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs. They called and took up the little Maria; and though Mr. ROSWELL longed to be on his way to England, yet he accompanied them to the Villa, as he was anxious to ſee Madam De
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:039134_0269_1013B23B4F48C3F8"/>
Shong ſettled in her new habitation, and JULIA was ſo earneſt in her perſuaſion to ſee him there; the rewards were ſo ample to all that had been kind to the late ſuffering, now wealthy Madam De Shong and JULIA, that the mean and little minded, regretted that they had been want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in generoſity.</p>
               <p>Before evening they arrived ſafely at the Villa, and were greeted by all its inhabitants with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of joy. Annet hung round JULIA, with a joy that her little heart had never known before. The porter had before this been aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his brutality to JULIA; the reflection and taunts of his fellow ſervants had puniſhed him; but before her arrival the meſſage from the Count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs, had convinced him how unacceptable his conduct would be to that lady; he now aſked her pardon, with a ſervility that always proves the little mind, and JULIA who never felt anger for an hour together, aſſured him it was forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
               <p>One of her firſt cares was to enquire for the Chevalier St. Armond, but the letter from Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via had been burnt with her cloaths, though ſhe recollected the contents; but her father removed her difficulties, and thought it not neceſſary to apply to the Chevalier; he preſented Donna Olivia, with an eſtate that ſupplied her with ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery wiſh of her heart. By this time Convents in France were nearly annihilated, and in a few months ſhe diſpoſed of that eſtate, and returned to England, where the remainder of her days are paſſing in eaſe and retirement.</p>
               <p>The Marquis put Iſabella and her huſband in poſſeſſion of a ſum that rendered their lives eaſy,
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:039134_0270_1013B23F2F42FFC0"/>
affluent, and free from anxiety. Madam De Shong choſe, with her little girl, to be a depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant upon the bounty of the Counteſs, and that lady and JULIA, continued to pay her every at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention that her merits and her misfortunes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled her to. The Marquis, at the requeſt of his daughter, ſent for Philada, that ſhe who ſo well loved his wife, might ſpend her old age, in the ſame houſe with her daughter, freed from the cares and buſineſs that ſhe had ſo faithfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and Jaques became what he ſo much wiſhed to be, a footman to JULIA, who took care that his wages ſhould be ſo large, as to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him to ſave a moiety every year; his ſervices were eaſy, and he was treated rather as an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble friend, than a domeſtic; while his mother was happy in being always near the child of her beloved Marchioneſs.</p>
               <p>Roſwell, ſpent only a few days with them, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient to embrace his mother and his Lucretia; he left the friends he loved and eſteemed, (and of whoſe happineſs he had been ſo inſtrumental,) with regret, and eſtabliſhed a correſpondence with them, which they agreed, ſhould laſt forev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed in the ſociety of a parent and aunt, that eſteemed her their choiceſt bleſſing; the pride and ornament of them both, with full power to gratify the benevolent feelings of her heart; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured of eaſe and affluence, in the full enjoyment of friendſhip, and the poſſeſſion of every virtue, JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIA wondered, ſhe was not happy, but whenev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er her thoughts turned towards COLWORT, which they did continually, ſhe was conſcious of the moſt agonizing feelings. Every ſearch had been
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:039134_0271_1013B240B10EF9A8"/>
made for him, without effect; letters from Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land informed them, he had not been heard of, and every enquiry proved equally fruitleſs. One whole year, had paſſed off in this ſtate of uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and in that time, JULIA's hand was ſought by ſome of the firſt men in the kingdom. Her beauty, goodneſs, and talents were of a nature ſo alluring, ſo charming, that it was impoſſible not to love and admire her; but conſidered as the only child, of the Marquis, heireſs of the vaſt poſſeſſions of him, and the Counteſs; ſhe was an object of ſuch importance, as to draw the wealthy and the noble from the remoteſt parts of France; but ſhe did not heſitate to confeſs herſelf engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in her refuſal of their love, poſſeſſed her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of their eſteem.</p>
               <p>It would have been pleaſing to the Marquis and her aunt, if ſhe could have made an election from her numerous admirers; they did not preſs her to do a thing that could for a moment add to the pangs ſhe evidently ſuffered, though ſhe ſtrove to conceal them.</p>
               <p>Juſt a year had expired, when the Counteſs received a letter from the daughter of Madam Gyron, informing her that lady was rapidly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining, and the phyſicians had ceaſed to flatter her with the hopes of recovery, and one of her laſt wiſhes was, to ſee Madam DE LAUNA, before her death, whom ſhe now beſought to viſit her at Paris. Though the Counteſs had no wiſh to leave her charming retreat, ſhe could not refuſe a requeſt, that was evidently the fruits of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. The Marquis choſe not to leave the Villa at ſo warm a ſeaſon of the year, yet he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, that his daughter, ſhould accompany his
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:039134_0272_1013B24356F5E630"/>ſiſter, and leave him, in the care of Madam de Shong, and Maria; though JULIA felt unwill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to quit a parent, ſhe ſo revered, yet ſhe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed his wiſhes, and ſet out with the Counteſs.</p>
               <p>They arrived at Paris, but three days before the death of Madam Gyron, who was conſoled to have an opportunity, to ſee, and take leave of her friends, and directly after her interment, they left Paris and ſet out for the Villa.</p>
               <p>At the cloſe of the ſecond day, they put up at an inn upon the road; the evening was uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly charming; a bright and lovely moon, had ariſen, juſt as the ſun had withdrawn its rays; the day had been remarkably warm, but a ſoft and delicious coolneſs entered at two large win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and refreſhed the air. In a frame of mind rather formed for penſive ſadneſs, than converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Counteſs had ordered the candles to be taken away, that they might enjoy the moon, and in a few moments they were ſo occupied by their own reflections, as not to heed the entrance of ſome perſons, who came in to an adjoining apartment which was only ſeparated from that in which they ſat, by a callico curtain, that hung ſuſpended from the ceiling. After a ſhort time however, their attention was forcibly drawn by the following converſation.</p>
               <p>My friend, (ſaid one of the ſtrangers,) is now enjoying a ſweet, and profound ſleep; the firſt he has been bleſt with for ſome days; while that is the caſe, do ſatisfy my curioſity and tell me, what has brought you to France in theſe times of trouble, and confuſion; to ſatisfy a dying friend, (replied the other,) I have left London, and to ſatisfy you, I will give you an account of
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:039134_0273_1013B24668891340"/>
the cauſe of my journey. It is now near thirty years ſince the Earl of Ormond, ſent his eldeſt ſon, to ſpend ſome time in France; an antient friendſhip had ſubſiſted between the family of Ormond, and Maravalda; the young gentleman was recommended to the Marquis, and treated with the utmoſt hoſpitality at his Chatteau, where the family then reſided, and which he was deſired to conſider as his home, while he contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued on the Continent; the Marquis had an only daughter, a very lovely girl, of about fifteen; a mutual attachment, was the conſequence of a conſtant intercourſe, and the young people got married, without conſulting friends, on either ſide; ſhortly after theſe private nuptials, the young Lord was recalled, and when he informed his father of the connection, he had formed, he found him abſolutely averſe to his proceedings, upon the account of the young lady's being edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in the Roman Catholic Religion, and as he found his endeavours, to alter his ſon's mind but vain, he impoſed upon him with an account of her death. Lord William, the ſecond ſon, went to France himſelf, and in concent with the young lady's mother, who was equally averſe to the match, as ſhe had been by her parents engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Count DE LAUNA, ſhe was likewiſe deceived, and led to believe that Lord Henry had died, ſoon after his arrival in England; but the lady was pregnant, and the fruits of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent attachment, was put into Lord William's hands, that he might be educated in England. In the courſe of the voyage, the idea was ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, to bring up the little boy, a ſtranger
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:039134_0274_1013B24A2AD915F0"/>
to his birth, and conceal, if poſſible, the whole af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair; he was well acquainted with his brother's ſtrong attachment, and he thought it probable, that he would never marry, and by concealing the child, he ſecured to himſelf, without diſpute, his brother's fortune, as well as title. The boy, was delivered to a wealthy merchant, who was intruſted with the ſecret, and who brought him up as the ſon of a deceaſed brother; thus he has grown up in ignorance of himſelf; but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits are ſeldom proſpered; Lord William, by the death of his father and brother, without heirs, came into quiet, and undiſturbed poſſeſſion of the fortune, and honors of his family; tho' he has been twice married; he has never had a child. He is now in a very alarming ſtate of health, his conſcience, has become a troubleſome monitor, and I am ſent over to viſit the Counteſs DE LAU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NA, for ſhe is the mother of the young man, and to aſk her pardon for the deception that has been practiſed upon her.</p>
               <p>It was with the utmoſt difficulty, that the Counteſs reſtrained herſelf, but her agitation was ſo great as to betray her, for her impatience was incontroulable; with hands claſped together, ſhe aroſe, and exclaimed, where is my ſon, tell me if I have a child; Oh tell me. She could walk but a few ſteps, and ſunk into a chair, while her quick, and convulſive ſobs, declared the agitated ſtate of her mind; JULIA with trembling hands was rubbing her temples, and in a faint voice beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging her to be calm. The ſervant entered with lights, and the gentleman who had heard the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, came into the room; it was ſome time
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:039134_0275_1013B24BAC734D90"/>
before ſhe appeared to take any notice of thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round her, and JULIA dreading the intire loſs of her reaſon; informed the perſons, who ſhe was, and begged them to give her an account, as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable as poſſible, when ſhe recovered her recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. Indeed, ſhe had ſtruggled ſo long with contending paſſions, it was no wonder that a variety of painful emotions burſting at once up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, reduced her to an alarming ſituation; by degrees ſhe came intirely to herſelf, and for ſome time ſeemed to be endeavouring to recollect herſelf. How are you my dear Madam, (ſaid JULIA?) Why, well my child. Has any thing been the matter, (cried the Counteſs in a weak voice?) Oh, now I remember; where are thoſe perſons, JULIA, that were in the next room, for ſurely, I have not dreamed? No, (my dear Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,) you have not, and when you are compoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thoſe gentlemen will inform you of every thing you can wiſh to know. I am calm, I am compoſed my dear; Oh tell me, if indeed I am ſo bleſſed as to have a ſon. After ſome heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the gentleman informed her, his errand was intirely to her, and begged to know if ſhe could forgive the Earl. If my ſon is living, (ſaid ſhe) from my ſoul, I can forgive that cruel family all the evils I have received at their hands. He was living a few months ſince, ſaid the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, his nominal uncle, received a letter from him; then he is not dead ſhe interrupted? I hope not, Madam, (he replied,) he left England ſome time ago, to viſit this country; I have promiſed his uncle, if poſſible to find him, and preſent him to you, one of the moſt amiable
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:039134_0276_10136EC24F774250"/>
young men, and one of the moſt accompliſhed in the world. A thouſand bleſſings on you, for this kind, benevolent intention, (cried the Count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs;) but tell me, ſome clue by which I may find him, what name does he bear? by what ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſhall I addreſs him, except by that of my ſon? His uncle, Madam, (ſaid the ſtranger,) called him <hi>Francis Colwort.</hi> Gracious Heaven, exclaimed the Counteſs, it was my ſon! Oh, my dear Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, reiterated JULIA, Mr. COLWORT was your ſon. COLWORT (interrupted the other gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,) COLWORT, did you ſay, Frank. I did; Oh, I have known him, (cried the diſtracted mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;) known him to be the beſt, and worthieſt of men; Heaven ſent him to ſave his mother's life, and even then my heart acknowledged him, as mine, but gracious Heaven, I have loſt him forever. Do not thus miſtruſt the goodneſs of Providence, (ſaid the ſtranger,) how long ſince you have ſeen him? It is now two years ſince he left the Villa; a year ago he was living, but I have too much reaſon to form the moſt dreadful fears. Take courage, Madam, it is not one fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night ſince he was living; and the Counteſs DE LAUNA, and a Madamoiſelle Vallace where the conſtant themes of his hopes and fears. Then he is ſtill alive, (cried JULIA, ſmiling through her tears,) and we ſhall yet be happy. Put an end to my ſuſpence, (ſaid the Counteſs) for I can bear it no longer; tell me where he is. The gentleman then begged her to be calm, and with great caution informed her that about two months ſince, he had found COLWORT, who was his moſt dear and intimate friend, a cloſe
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:039134_0277_10136EB9D0E604F0"/>
priſoner in the carmagnole, that he had found his way to him, and by the power of gold, and a little flattery to the keeper; he had effected his eſcape; that they were on their way to the Villa when he was taken ſick, and had not yet recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Where is he, (interrupted the Counteſs,) tell me where he is, that I may fly to attend him, for who is ſo fit as a mother, to be about the ſick bed of her ſon? Not to night, Madam, he is too weak, ſuch a meeting would overcome him, and undo all that my care has effected; he is in this very houſe, in the care of people whoſe duty, and buſineſs it is to attend upon him; but great cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be uſed to introduce you to his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. When the Counteſs heard that her ſon was in the ſame houſe with her, ſhe would have gone directly to him, but for the prudence of his friend; and after a few moments reflection, ſhe conſented to be guided by him.</p>
               <p>But nothing could prevent her from ſpending the night in an apartment next to his chamber, with JULIA; when the door was opened ſhe could hear him turn upon his bed, diſtinguiſh his breath, and his faint voice when he aſked for the medicine. It was near day when he ſeemed to be quite awake from a refreſhing ſlumber; his friend who had ſet by him, then informed him that an Equipage with many attendants had ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived there the night before, and the ſervants were informed, it belonged to the Counteſs DE LAUNA; he pauſed, and COLWORT, with ſome impatience inquired if he ſaw the perſons who came in the carriage. His friend told him, he had ſeen two ladies, and had reaſon to think one
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:039134_0278_1013B25189D41530"/>
was the Counteſs, but the other appeared young and handſome. The agitation of COLWORT, rendered him ſo inquiſitive, that he at length owned JULIA was with the Counteſs, in the houſe, and that he would at their riſing, requeſt them to pay a viſit to the ſick chamber; it was then that the returning pride of COLWORT, gave his friend new hopes, he was anxious to appear well, and even handſome, before JULIA; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps his illneſs had weakened his mind, as well as his perſon, for could a man be vain; could he wiſh to be handſome?</p>
               <p>When the ſun aroſe, the gentleman left the room, and COLWORT kept his eyes fixed on the door, and waited his return, with great impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; in leſs than ten minutes he beheld him enter with thoſe perſons ſo beloved, ſo long wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for; he ſtretched out his hand to them, and the Counteſs and JULIA ſtationed themſelves at the ſides of his bed, and endeavored to articulate ſome kind enquiry, or ſome affectionate queſtion; but their lips refuſed to do juſtice to the feelings of their hearts, and their tears and looks could on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſs their emotion. In a few moments the phyſician arrived, and in a modeſt, but deciſive manner, pronounced the patient out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but declared him ſtill ſo weak as to require great care, and attention; the ladies laid an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bargo upon their lips, leſt he ſhould be injured, but ſat by him the whole day, and though the Counteſs longed to call him ſon, longed to preſs him to her maternal boſom, her diſcretion over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came her impatience, and ſhe waited until con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed health ſhould authoriſe ſuch a diſcovery.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="unknown:039134_0279_1013B25595ACD7E8"/>
The next day he was amazingly better, for to the kind attentions of friendſhip, was added the ſoothing cares of love, and his medicines opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more kindly when preſented by JULIA, or her aunt, then when given by his friend; he ſat up ſome time, and enjoyed their ſociety. In three days the gentleman from England made his appearance, COLWORT was rejoiced, but ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed to ſee him; aſked a thouſand queſtions reſpecting his friends at home, and as he was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly attached to him, related every occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that had happened to him. In anſwer to this information, the gentleman told him, he had a very wonderful ſtory to relate reſpecting himſelf, which required ſteady attention, and more fortitude, than he appeared at preſent to poſſeſs. Thus prefaced, he told him every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, concealing only the name of the Counteſs, and at the end, told him he had been ſo fortunate, as to diſcover his mother, who was rich, and amiable, and would with joy receive him as her ſon, on one condition, which, was that he conſented to marry her niece, that ſhe tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly loved, and who would be heireſs to a noble fortune. If that is the condition, (ſaid COLWORT, with energy,) ſhe will never acknowledge me; my faith is pledged; and if this change, in my ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, has effected a change in JULIA VALLACE, I will never marry, I would die to ſerve or pleaſe a parent; the name of mother vibrates upon my ear, and is dear to my heart, but if a mother, I have never known, can wiſh the only pledge of an unfortunate attachment, to violate his moſt ſacred engagement, I fear I could never love her
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:039134_0280_1013B25717AB4F98"/>
as I ought. But (ſaid the gentleman,) if Madam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oiſelle ſhould happen to be the niece, and the Counteſs the mother. Ah, (ſaid COLWORT,) am I ſo bleſſed, can I have ſuch a mother? Have I ſuch a ſon, ſaid the Counteſs? (Embracing him with tenderneſs.) Yes my ſon, you are my child, and without one condition, I receive you to my heart, and thank Heaven for ſo great a bleſſing; but to the reader's imagination, the remainder of the ſcene muſt be referred.</p>
               <p>In a few days, Mr. COLWORT, now Francis Ormond, was able to leave the inn; his two friends at the invitation of his mother, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him to the Villa, where they found the Marquis impatient to receive his ſiſter's ſon. Smiles of real chearfulneſs, and heartfelt ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, once more reviſited the countenance, and animated the features of JULIA; the whole family participated in her joy, and her nuptials were ſolemnized directly after her return. By this time the troubles in France had gained ſuch a criſis, that it was neceſſary for every friend to order, for every lover of peace and religion, to leave that ill-fated nation. The principles of the Illuminata triumphed; anarchy, confuſion, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, and bloodſhed ſucceeded; and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis was, though old and infirm, pitched upon as a victim; but being nearly related to ſome perſons, then in power, who had not yet loſt ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery ſenſe of humanity, he was ſo fortunate as to leave the kingdom, and with the Counteſs DE LAUNA, having diſpoſed of their eſtates much under their real value, tranſmitted the money to England, whither they retired with all their ſervants, Madam DE SHONG, Iſabella, and her huſband.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="285" facs="unknown:039134_0281_1013B259E55C06A0"/>
The care and attention of their ſon, and daughter, ſoftened the fatigues of the voyage.—And the philanthropy which reigned in their boſoms, rendered them literally citizens of the world; they regarded France deſpoiled of all her virtues, no longer as their country, and carrying with them, all they held dear, London ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came agreeable.</p>
               <p>They were received by the Earl of Ormond, with a mingled pleaſure and remorſe; he now approached the confines of the grave, and gave up thoſe poſſeſſions without regret, which he had been guilty of deceit to obtain. The Counteſs was too happy in her ſon's merits and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments, to harbour any reſentment againſt his uncle, and a perfect reconciliation preceded his death, which event took place in leſs than one month after their arrival; he left the whole of his eſtate, and ample poſſeſſions to his nephew; his title deſcended to a diſtant branch of the family, as the marriage of the Counteſs, and the father of her ſon, was certainly illegal; and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond and JULIA preferred the claim of virtue and benevolence, to that of rank, and the title of plain Mr. and Mrs. Ormond was more pleaſing, and vibrated with more delight upon their hearts, than Earl and Counteſs, with half a dozen right honorables at the end of them. Old Mr. COL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WORT, who had acted rather as a parent, than an uncle, to his nominal nephew, was one of the firſt who greeted them with a welcome in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; the affection which he felt for him, was returned, and gratitude for reciprocal favours had bound the ties of friendſhip ſo cloſely, that
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:039134_0282_1013B25B6D89A760"/>
nothing but the laſt ſigh can extinguiſh it. His daughter whom Ormond had brought from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, accompanied her father; anxious to ſee one, whom ſhe conſidered as her beſt friend and deliverer; and to pay her reſpects to that JULIA whom ſhe had admired and loved from his deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nor was her pre-ſentiment in her favour leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened by acquaintance; for JULIA ever fond of the unfortunate, carreſſed, and cheriſhed her with affection, that increaſed every hour,</p>
               <p>As ſoon as ROSWELL heard of the arrival of his friends, he left his pariſh and family, to bid them welcome, and certainly no one out of their own circle was more deſervedly dear. His Lucretia had crowned his happineſs; his mother was well, and both longed to ſee and embrace thoſe whoſe virtues they eſtimated ſo highly. He informed them, that a large eſtate which lay within two miles of his neat and convenient parſonage, was now to be ſold, and as the Ormond ſeat was in its vicin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, he urged them ſo ſtrongly to purchaſe it, that the proſpect of being his neighbour pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed; and the Marquis immediately conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the purchaſe; they then retired, and the two houſes became alternately the reſidence of the family; the huſband of Iſabella, as he was the friend of the family, now became their joint ſtewart; Madam DE SHONG was inſured all the conveniencies of life, and all its elegancies; and the conſtant intercourſe that was kept up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ROSWELL, and his amiable wife, as it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed all their pleaſures, ſweetened the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing days of that excellent woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="287" facs="unknown:039134_0283_1013B25F69DEC000"/>
Not long after their ſettlement JULIA was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed to receive a viſit from CARLOS; ſhe found that young man, as good as ever, delighted with her happineſs, and cured of a paſſion, that he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> found hopeleſs. The daughter of Mr. COLWORT was at that time on a viſit at the grove; ſhe had recovered her beauty and her ſpirits, and the generous Spaniard felt the force of her charms, he frankly confeſſed that he had once loved JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIA, and now offered a heart that had been ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the power of a tender attachment; as this had been the caſe with the lady, ſhe could make no reaſonable objection; and urged by her father, by ORMOND and JULIA, perſuaded by the Counteſs, and her brother, ſhe conſented that Mr. ROSWEL ſhould perform the ceremony of marriage at the grove; a ceremony that render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſucceeding days of both, as happy as is conſiſtent with a ſtate ſubjected to the changes of mortality.</p>
               <p>Juſt at the time of this wedding, Mr. Ormond was ſummoned up to London, to viſit a convict that had received ſentence of death for a murder; when he was introduced to the unhappy man, he found a perſon he had never ſeen before; but the myſtery was ſoon unravelled; the wretch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed he was the phyſician who had preſented a poiſoned cup to the Marchioneſs, and who by miſtake had been the cauſe of the Count's death. He declared himſelf innocent of the crime for which he was about to ſuffer, but thought the vengeance of heaven had overtaken him, for his former iniquities. The confeſſion he made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the Illuminata and their horrid deſigns
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:039134_0284_1013B26375CC5AA8"/>
upon the Marquis; ſet their characters and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, in a light too ſhocking to be delineated. ORMOND juſtly ſtruck with their enormities, thanked heaven, that he had eſcaped with thoſe he loved, from a country, that had become the nurſery of this horde of vipers. He aſſured the unhappy man of his, and the family's forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and left him to ſuffer the ſentence of the law.
