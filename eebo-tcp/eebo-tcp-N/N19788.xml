            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>OBSERVATIONS, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>MANY Phyſicians have publiſhed in the newſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of this country, their methods of preventing and curing this diſeaſe, which may be ranked as one of the moſt deſtructive and fatal;—but none of them have yet thought of favoring the public with an accurate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the nature and particular ſymptoms of the fever, that makes ſuch cruel havoc.</p>
            <p>Never agreeing among themſelves, they have mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually oppoſed the opinions of each other, and have often beſtowed reciprocal offence. The reſult of this difference of ideas, always dangerous for ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humanity, has been, that each preſcribed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own manner, as well for preſerving perſons againſt the contagion, as for treating the diſeaſe, by bleeding, draſtic purges, by ſtimulants, by diluents, by demulcents, by antiſeptics, and by tonics, without pointing out, in the ſmalleſt degree, the circumſtances or particular caſes, wherein ſuch medicines might be employed or rejected.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:025855_0005_0FCF6C628B121758"/>The moſt credulous amongſt the people, alarmed by the public papers, and by the numerous precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions adviſed to be taken againſt the pretended peſtilence, began to adminiſter medicines to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and in order to avoid imaginary evils, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced real ones; ſome by having recourſe to the heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing regimen, gave additional fire to their diſeaſe, and thus created their own graves—others applied to phyſicians, who, ſmitten with fear, thought that they perceived peſtilential appearances in a common diſorder, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered medicines, which could only add to the evil. Of conſequence, thoſe who did not fall a ſacrifice, reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with difficulty. Hence the number of the ſick and dead have amazingly encreaſed; and the ſentiment of fear operating upon every mind, has made the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the inhabitants to leave the city, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake in it, without attendance or aſſiſtance, the ſick, who were not able to quit it. <note n="*" place="bottom">I could mention ſeveral facts to prove the melancholy ſituation of the ſick, from the deſertion of their friends; but we muſt forgive thoſe individuals, in favor of many of the inhabitants of Philadelphia, who have hurried to the aſſiſtance of the poor with an ardor which does ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to humanity.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Would to God, that inſtead of that fear carried to exceſs, the citizens of Philadelphia had imitated the Turks! thus behaving like them towards thoſe, would not have abandoned their children, nor the children
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:025855_0006_0FCF6C63EDAAB068"/>their parents, the ſervants their maſters, nor friends each other; but every one would have contributed to comfort and ſolace one another. The phyſicians were frequently compelled, by motives of humanity, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come nurſes to the ſick, who were unable of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to take the medicines. <note n="*" place="bottom">They have by their flight to the country fully complied with the Latin Diſtich,
<q>
                     <l>Hoc tria labificam tollunt adverbia peſtem,</l>

                  </q>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe remarks may ſound harſhly, but they are founded upon my own experience as well as that of ſeveral other phyſicians, who, whilſt others were argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the means of preſerving the city from the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, were courageouſly treading in the path of prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, ſolicitous to fulfil the ſacred and religious duties of their profeſſion.</p>
            <p>In order to make up as much as in my power lies, for the void left by thoſe who have ſpoken of that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe in the public papers, I ſhall endeavour to expreſs my ideas as clearly and preciſely as I can.</p>
            <p>I may have miſtaken the inductions with which the diagnoſtic ſigns of the diſeaſe have furniſhed me. I may alſo have miſtaken the proximate and diſtant cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the preſent epidemic. But what I am to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, ſhall be leſs ſounded on theory, which often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, than on practice, and my clinical obſervations.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:025855_0007_0FCF6C6645B4E060"/>Thus, I will only ſay what I have ſeen or believe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to have ſeen, in my patients. I ſhall neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerate nor diſguiſe any thing. I only ſeek for truth, and I write but for the good of humanity, without intending to give my obſervations for inconteſtable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions. Hippocrates has ſaid of medicine, <hi>Ars longa, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſio celeris, experimentum periculoſum, et judicium diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile.</hi> I have, then, no other aim but to ſtimulate my col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues, more learned than me, to enlighten the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic. It is our duty likewiſe to undeceive the phyſicians in other parts of this continent, and of Europe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſpecifics recommended in the newſpapers of North America, which may be very fatal to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>All epidemics are more or leſs contagious. They can be but the effect of a common and univerſal cauſe: the vitiated nature of aliments, or a derangement of the temperature of the atmoſphere, cauſe them. If the air is not infected, diſeaſes cannot be epidemic, and this is ſo, <hi>indeed,</hi> though it only attacks the natives.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <q>Many circumſtances, ſays Boerhaave, induce us to believe that the cauſes of epidemic diſeaſes reſide in the air, and depend upon the inexplicable variety of the exhalations therein contained.</q>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>What can be the cauſe of that corruption of the air? For what reaſon are the natives and thoſe inured to the climate of Philadelphia alone infected, with the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:025855_0008_0FCF6C67AC0CD330"/>prevailing diſeaſe, whilſt foreigners eſcape it? they are the firſt ſubjects of our enquiry.</p>
            <p>The ſummer of 1792 was very warm. We were tormented by an amazing number of flies and other inſects, till the middle of November. The following winter was very moderate as to cold, but ſubject to ſurpriſing variations. By various meteorological obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, it appears that the thermometer<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Reaumur's.</hi>
               </note> aſcended and deſcended from eight to ten degrees in a ſingle day. There was almoſt a conſtant rain, till the end of the Spring, which was very cold, and very damp. There was no hard froſt, and the ſnow had ſcarcely fallen, when it was ſucceeded by a thaw. <note n="§" place="bottom">According to the obſervations of Hippocrates,
<q>when the winter has been too mild, or too cold, when the Spring or Summer, and the following Autumn have been dry, we muſt fear cruel diſeaſes.</q>
The muſquitoes were uncommonly numerous during Autumn:
<q>a certain ſign,</q>
ſays Dr. Lind, of an unwholeſome atmoſphere.</note> The waters, which, without being frozen, had been ſtagnant; the quantity of inſects, which winter had killed, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails of the fiſh made uſe of in the city, caſt by the ſide of the Delaware, the rotten ſkins of the dead animals, and reptiles left near the wharves, or at a ſhort diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the city, have all certainly contributed to fill the air with putrid and hurtful miaſma. Theſe added to the quantity of vapours, and of corpuſcles of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:025855_0009_0FCF2F2B744C84F0"/>all kinds with which the atmoſphere is always loaded, cannot but rarify or thicken the liquids, affect the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids, and derange the animal economy, in the moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible manner.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <q>A ſtench which proceeded from the lakes about two leagues from Montpellier,</q>
ſays Mr. Sauvage, in his Noſology,
<q>produced peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial pleuriſies in the neighbouring cities.</q>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides the burning heat of this Summer, we have had a ſmall ſhare of wind, rain, or thunder ſince Spring; and thoſe three agents are neceſſary to purge the air from the putrid miaſma, and the infectious par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles with which it was impregnated. The exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons continually produced by the rays of the ſun, from the prodigious number of burying places in Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, muſt be ſubjoined to the other cauſes of infection. To theſe we likewiſe muſt add the great conſumption of meat, ſalt proviſions, and green fruits; the ſtrong drink, an ill fermented beer, and cyder made of green fruit; we will perceive, I think, in this manner of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the inhabitants of this country, (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conformity of their conſtitutions to the atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, of which I ſhall ſpeak hereafter) that their ſtomachs were much more diſpoſed to receive the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid miaſmas of the air, than the ſtomachs of thoſe who have obſerved a good regimen, and have been regular in their eating, and ſober in their drinking. Let one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:025855_0010_0FCF6C6AB4710898"/>the moſt part of thoſe who have been attacked by this diſeaſe. He will find that ſeven-eighths have been ſtrong perſons, mechanics who had not obſerved any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimen, and children, whom green fruits, and an immenſe quantity of water melons, and ſweet potatoes, have cauſed to be attacked by worms, which killed them, without the moſt part of the latter being attacked by any particular fever, either bilious, putrid, or malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Beſides, we are not ignorant, that every country has its periodical diſeaſes; that the ſpring, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinox, and ſummer, produce a great deal of diſorder in the animal oeconomy, and that as ſoon as the air is infected, the character of endemical diſeaſes is chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and they become more ſerious, and mortal. That being once admitted, we ſhall proceed, to inveſtigate the nature of the fever, which the air and ſo many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſes have produced, and we ſhall afterwards examine which are the ſureſt means of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. I do not flatter myſelf that I ſhall analyſe theſe objects with certainty: phyſic being a ſcience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectural, notwithſtanding its own principles, and the maſs of knowledge requiſite for practiſing it.—I will then only relate the obſervations which I have made upon a conſiderable number of patients, and the infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences with which they have ſupplied me.</p>
            <p>Fevers, in general, may be ranked in two claſſes: eſſential fevers, and ſymptomatic fevers. Theſe take
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:025855_0011_0FCF6C6CEE79A8C8"/>their origin from a local vice, or from another diſeaſe cauſed by ſome accident, or by ſome putrid miaſma re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding in the air; and whoſe characters vary infinitely, owing as well to the complexion, to the ſolids and liquids, as to the ſtomach, to the liver, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to the whole hypogaſtric region, and abdominals, &amp;c. We ſhall ſay nothing of the eſſential fevers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the fault of the blood and humours alone: which appear to us to have no affinity with the epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical diſeaſes, ſince they are the effects of a complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of cauſes belonging to the individual.</p>
            <p>The reigning fever as far as I have been able to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, begins by pains in the loins, and in the head, at firſt light, and afterwards acute, accompanied with chills more or leſs conſiderable. The face then becomes very red, as well as the eyes, which are filled with tears. Some are delirious from the firſt day of the fever, ſome only towards the third day, after which they ſink into a ſtate of weakneſs, or into a profound lethargy, from which they never recover. The belly, and <hi>hypocon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dres,</hi> excepting a few pains, are almoſt in their natural ſtate; but the ſtomach is generally tenſe or painful. The tongue, in all caſes, from the beginning to the end, is loaded with a whitiſh cruſt, and the edges are of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high red.</p>
            <p>Some have vomitings from the firſt days, others only towards the third or fourth day. The matter which
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:025855_0012_0FCF6C6E74ED1668"/>they then bring up, is whitiſh, green or black. Some vomit pure blood. They have a bloody flux, always preceded by bleeding of the noſe more or leſs conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. Some are thirſty, and others, though their tongue is dry, are not ſo. The ſkin is ſometimes dry, and ſhrivelled, and ſometimes much covered with ſweat. But I have not perceived on the ſkin of any of my patients, any buboes or carbuncles or any other peſtilential eruption. I have obſerved on three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons only, ſome few red ſpots, like the bite of a fly, on the ſtomach or breaſt.<note n="*" place="bottom">Thoſe ſpots were ſo inconſiderable, that I doubt whether I may rank them among the petechiae, or milliary eruptions.</note> Many are fatigued and low ſpirited.</p>
            <p>Some have kept their ſpirits, and have exhibited all the good ſymptoms, during four days, till the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the fifth, when all is changed, and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is deſpaired of. The urine, as to quantity, is the ſame as in a ſtate of health; as to quality, it is highly coloured, with a great deal of a whitiſh ſediment. But ſome have, towards the beginning of the ſeventh day, conſiderable evacuations of blood.<note n="†" place="bottom">Amongſt my patients, I had but one who had an entire ſuppreſſion of urine during five days. Warm baths and flaxſeed mucilages were of great ſervice to him, and he is now recovered.</note> The pulſe, that compaſs of phyſicians, is here very equivocal. It ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:025855_0013_0FCF6C701CFC3250"/>correſponds with the alarming ſymptoms which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the diſeaſe, excepting the ſtarting of the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons; and that in a few patients, I have neither found the pulſe intermittent, nor altogether obliterated.— More or leſs motion, ſtrength or weakneſs was all that I could obſerve; ſo that, during the time of my attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance I regarded, with more attention, the other ſigns, than the ſtate of the pulſe. In that variety of ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, the patients die on the ſecond, third, fifth, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, or ninth day, of the diſeaſe; and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the obſervation of thoſe critical days, ſeveral have elapſed without having any ſenſible criſis, whereby nature could drive away the diſeaſe. They recovered in proportion as the alarming ſymptoms ceaſed, which happens very ſeldom in acute diſeaſes. Some women, attacked with that fever during their menſes, had them ſuddenly ſuppreſſed, and children ſometimes paſſed up and down a great quantity of worms, for the moſt part very red. In the critical days, the hiccup torments the patients in a moſt cruel manner, and then the eyes and ſkin of ſome become yellowiſh. Several patients who ſpate or vomited blood, bled at the noſe, evacuated a brown matter, and were tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the hiccup, did however recover, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding thoſe alarming ſigns, which together with the other ſymptoms, announced the approach of death. But thoſe who vomited a black matter, who piſſed blood, who were heavy and ſleepy, who became
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:025855_0014_0FCF6C718122B9C8"/>yellow before the ſeventh day, or whoſe ſtomach was much ſwelled, eſpecially thoſe who in the beginning of the diſeaſe, made any uſe of cathartics, died be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the fifth and eighth day.<note n="*" place="bottom">It is well known that purgatives do not act only upon the ſtomach and inteſtinal canal, but their action is communicated to the liver, the pancreas, and the ſpleen.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe are the obſervations, I have made on my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, whoſe different ſituations I have ſtudied with the moſt ſteady application.</p>
            <p>What is then this fever? Is it the ſweating ſickneſs, the putrid bilious fever, the inflammatory fever, or the diſeaſe of Siam, or the malignant fever?—I do not know; but I am convinced, that it unites in itſelf almoſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very characteriſtic ſign of theſe diverſe fevers. Beſides, it diſguiſes itſelf, varies and aſſumes ſo many different aſpects, according to the complexion and conſtitution of the patient, the ſtate of the maſs of blood and humours, the diſeaſes, which he was ſubject to, when he was attacked with that fever, and ſtill much more than it is ſuppoſed, to the tranquility and agitation of his mind, that all judgment, and even inductions, upon its particular character, are liable to error.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs it appears that it is produced by one
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:025855_0015_0FCF6C72F6469B88"/>and the ſame cauſe: that it ſhews the cauſe of its own principle, and is only derived from an inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the miaſmas of the air, combined with the diſpoſitions of the body, produce an inflammation in the epiſgraſtic region, which affects the liver and the hypocondria in ſuch a manner, that the blood, the bile, and other humours acquire more fluidity, owing to the heat increaſing the dilatation of the veſſels, cauſing a diſſolution of the blood and of the humours, which are the principal characters with which the fever in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is accompanied. Pains in the ſtomach and reins, the firſt ſigns of this diſeaſe, are ſucceeded by the pathagnomic ſigns, as well as by vomitings and piſſing of blood; and it is certain, that all which can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the gaſtritis, of which the ſeveral ſpecies have been deſcribed by Sauvage and Hoffman, and eſpecially draſtic cathartics, ſtrong emeticks, and all that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the fluidity of the humours, ſuch as mercury, &amp;c. are not only contrary to the treatment of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, but may occaſion certain death. And how many ſince it prevails have been victims of the violent treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and pretended ſpecifics?<note n="*" place="bottom">It is true that Mr. Roſenſten, a celebrated Swediſh phyſician, preſcribed calomel with camphor and aloes, as a preſervative againſt the ſmall pox, a diſeaſe well marked. But who is yet acquainted with the nature of an epidemic, ſo as to preſcribe preſervatives in the beginning of the diſeaſe? Beſides mercury diſſolves the blood, and above all the other humours. It is then, contrary and dangerous, for all that has a tendency to diſſolution, and conſequently in the prevailing diſeaſe. Let the bodies of thoſe who die of that diſeaſe be opened, it will be found that the lower part of the belly, and all the epigraſtic are the only ones af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, while the heart and the brains are in their natural ſtate. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, let the dead bodies of thoſe who uſed mercury and cathartics, be examined, and it will appear, whether in theſe, the evil has not been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed and whether the gangrenous ſpots do not viſibly diſcover the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent irritations cauſed by thoſe corroſive medicines. The philoſophical ſtone of phyſic, the univerſal panacea, is not yet diſcovered, and were it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt poſſible things, one may well be allowed to doubt that Heaven had only reſerved that diſcovery to the phyſicians of this part of the globe.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:025855_0016_0FCF6C746F1C7490"/>The reſult of all that I have ſaid is that in the cure of this diſeaſe, no regular ſyſtem can be followed.— Therefore, I followed none, nor have I adopted any one medicine in preference to another. My preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were only regulated by the conjectures which I have drawn from the examination of my patients, and the informations they could give me concerning their conſtitutions, and the ſtate of their health before they were taken ill.</p>
            <p>After that, here is a ſummary of the method I have followed, and ſtill conſtantly follow, with ſuch ſucceſſes, that compared, with the number of patients, whom I fear to have been the unfortunate victims of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:025855_0017_0FCF6C779657AE48"/>the means uſed in vain to cure them, confirms me more and more in the reſolution I have taken to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that practice.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>I have viſited and attended during the courſe of this diſeaſe, that is to ſay, ſince the 28th Auguſt to this day, more than 160 patients, of whom 117 were really attacked with the fever, which it would be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to call by a very characteriſtic name. Of that number I had the misfortune to loſe 19. To eleven of theſe I was only ſent for on the 2d, 4th or 5th day after they were taken ill, after they had been treated by other phyſicians, after they had taken violent vomits, cathartics, tincture of bark, with liq. laud. as they themſelves informed me. Every one complained of beating pains on their ſtomach already much ſwelled.— Eight others who ſent for me in the beginning of this ſickneſs, had on the ſecond or third day of my treatment, conſiderable vomitings of a black matter, the jaundice, piſſed blood, and died on the 4th, 5th, 7th or 9th day.</p>
                  <p>I do not mention other patients whom I have viſited and treated during that time the number of which exceeds fifty. Many had but little remittent, or colliquative fever. A greater number were affected more in mind than body, having conſulted me, the more I attributed their uneaſy ſituation to the fear they were ſeized with, and the more that I aſſured them they were not ſick, the leſs they believed me. I was obliged in order to cure them, to make uſe of an innocent ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem, by giving them ſome agreeable potions concealed under the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſting appearance of medicines; and though they were only made with a few grains of cooling powders of ſtahl, they operated on them, by the merit of perſuaſion, by reſtoring to them the tranquility of mind they had loſt.</p>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:025855_0018_0FCF6C78EDA34DC8"/>As ſoon as I was called to viſit a patient, and as ſoon as I perceived the leaſt ſign of inflammation, I, firſt of all, ordered him to be bled once or twice, and regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the quantity of blood to be let, according to his age, and the ſtrength of his conſtitution. If it was the firſt day of the ſickneſs, and the inflammation was not likely to be of conſequence, and if the patient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined much to vomiting, I adminiſtered to him either a vomit in a large quantity of water, or ſome purgative of ſenna, manna, cream of tartar, and ſalt of ſeignette to cleanſe the firſt paſſages. If he complained of a head ach, which did not leſſen, or if the inflammation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, I preſcribed bleeding after the purgatives<note n="*" place="bottom">None of my patients were bled more than twice, and they loſt but 6 or 8 ounces of blood at a time. My well grounded fear of the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the blood, made me to be very cautious about bleeding, which I preſcribed but in caſe of need, and according to the ſigns I perceived in my patients. Thus many recovered without having been bled.</note>, and during that time until the third day, I only preſcribed plentiful and cooling drinks, and in proportion as the ſtrength failed, or I ſuſpected a beginning of diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the humours, I did not ſpare cordials, or the moſt ſoftening aſtringents, mixed with mucilages and antiphlogiſtics; not forgetting, when occaſion requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, antiſeptics, for which I uſed the alexipharmic eſſence of ſtahl, and the camphoric tincture of beſoard; I alſo preſcribed bliſters, when I perceived the leaſt
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:025855_0019_0FCF6C7A7056F060"/>ſign of ſleepineſs. I have never purged any patient, excepting thoſe who took phyſic on the firſt day; but about the ſixth day of his illneſs, or when I perceived, by his urine, that the coction was made, I never uſed bark, which I look upon rather as a good ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than as an antiputrid, before the diſeaſe is abating. As to children, all I preſcribed for them was bermifu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and glyſters made of milk and honey, and every one evacuated a conſiderable quantity of reddiſh worms.</p>
            <p>Amongſt all the melancholy ſymptoms of this cruel diſeaſe, I found none ſo difficult to calm as vomitings, and hiccup. Acids compoſed of dulcified marine, and vitriolic ſalt, had but little ſucceſs. I ſucceeded much better, as well againſt continual vomitings as againſt bloody evacuations, with a ſtrong mucilage made of flax-ſeed, gum-arabic, honey, and cinnamon water, of which I directed my patients to take a ſpoonful every ten minutes.</p>
            <p>Topics of emollient herbs boiled in ſtrong wine, vinegar applied warm on the ſtomach, the lower part of the belly, and the reins, have alſo been of great ſervice with me againſt the pains of thoſe parts. I uſed no narcotics. If the patient, when the diſeaſe abated, was tormented with a want of ſleep, I only adminiſtered to him almond-juice very thick, mixed
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:025855_0020_0FCF6C7BEF680068"/>with diacodium. In fine, my whole treatment was at firſt only eſtabliſhed upon the inflammation, which I always believed to be the origin of that diſeaſe, and afterwards on the diſſolution of humors which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and therefore I made the application according to circumſtances, and the different ſhapes in which the diſeaſe preſented itſelf, and of the beſt advices given us by the moſt eminent authors who have written on phyſic.</p>
            <p>But is, or is not this diſeaſe contagious? A queſtion which I think I am only able to anſwer by a diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which experience ſeems to juſtify. It is contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for thoſe, whoſe organical conſtitution has great homogenity with the air of this country. The affinity and relation exiſting between their conſtitution, and the impreſſion of this atmoſphere, gives them a near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er diſpoſition to receive the impreſſions of the putrid miaſmas, with which the air is impregnated, and which alter and trouble, more, or leſs that equilibrium of the ſolids and liquids, ſo neceſſary to maintain good health. The diſeaſe is not contagious for foreigners, whoſe conſtitutions have little homogenity with that dry air. We are convinced of it by the prodigious num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers abounding in this city, none of whom were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked with that diſeaſe, whilſt the moſt part of the natives, and thoſe uſed to the climate, were taken ill with it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:025855_0021_0FCF6C7D6DFC9928"/>The relations of man with all that ſurrounds him, and the influence of the air on the conſtitutions, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deſcribed. We ſee the effects of them without often being able to penetrate the cauſes. We can give but conjectures on that head; and I only ground this, upon this certain fact, that men accuſtomed to a climate, are much more ſubject to the hurtful variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and influences of its atmoſphere, than thoſe, whoſe complexion, through a phyſical propenſity, is ſtill ſubject to the nature of the climate that they have juſt quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. From thence ariſe endemic diſeaſes, which do not affect foreigners, and from thence alſo the peculiar diſeaſes which attack new-comers, without affecting the natives, as experience has often ſhewed to us in our colonies.</p>
            <p>Such are, in a few words, what I have obſerved in this diſeaſe, and the methods I have followed to cure it. This is what the little leiſure, left me by my patients, could allow me to commit haſtily to writing. The public will not, certainly, find, in my ſtyle, any thing to make amends for the dryneſs of the ſubject I am wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon. If what I ſay, has nothing new nor learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what I have ſhewn, without order and method, is at leaſt ſaid with candor and ſincerity. My aim is to obtain light, in order the better to ſerve my patients; and ſhould this ſhort publication prove agreeable to the public, I will give a longer diſſertation on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:025855_0022_0FCF6C7F25C5DC60"/>epidemic. If, after what I have juſt ſaid, any phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, having followed a method different from mine, may have met with greater ſucceſs, I beg that they would publiſh their obſervations. I aſſure them, before hand, of my ſincere gratitude, and of the thanks of the public; <hi>non eſt in medico ſemper relevetur ut aeger.</hi>

            <head>POSTCRIPT.</head>
            <p>Whilſt this paper was in the hands of one of my friends, who had undertaken to tranſlate it into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, and print it, I had an opportunity of viſiting the new aſylum of the unfortunate, at Buſh-hill. For this favour, I was indebted to Mr. Deveſe, a phyſician and ſurgeon from, St. Domingo, who, by a happy choice, has been entruſted with the care and direction of the hoſpital at Buſh-hill; and who, to a feeling heart, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites the knowledge requiſite for doing honour to his two profeſſions. At my requeſt, he was kind enough to have opened, in my preſence, the bodies of two pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, who had died of the reigning diſeaſe. Of theſe two, the one had, before he came to the hoſpital, made uſe of the draſtic purges with mercury, and the other had been treated in a more mild manner. The anatomical inſpection of theſe two bodies, and of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others, made in the ſame hoſpital, has confirmed, in a moſt incontrovertible manner, the truth of what I have advanced, in one of my notes (P. 31,) and have plainly proved the havoc that thoſe violent medicines, when adminiſtered in an inflammatory ſickneſs, have cauſed in the ſtomach and inteſtines, the effects where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were perceived upon the bodies of other patients who died of that diſorder, although treated in a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent manner. Therefore if the <hi>virus</hi> of that epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal diſeaſe, yields, but with difficulty, to the cool anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlogiſtic method, much more will it deſtroy the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:025855_0024_0FCF6C81EEF0E820"/>in a ſtill ſhorter time, if, with the intention of oppoſing it, we augment its violence by medicines ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logous to its deſtructive nature.</p>
            <p>How much that new hoſpital has penetrated my heart with gladneſs! The ſituation, the cleanneſs, the neatneſs that reign in every room, the contented and ſatisfied looks of the patients, who ſeem to bleſs their benefactors from the bottom of their hearts; the vigilance, the activity of the French under-ſurgeons, American nurſes, and others whom I found there; the obliging and ſolacing manner in which they ſpeak to the patients; in a word, every circumſtance has moved my ſenſibility, in ſuch a way, as to ſhed tears. Without prodigality, there is nothing waſted in that hoſpital. The moſt valuable medicines, the moſt exquiſite wines, the niceſt and moſt ſuitable diet, in ſhort, every thing is in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances, and every thing is deſtined for the relief of thoſe unhappy and devoted perſons, whom the epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic has ſtruck with <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
