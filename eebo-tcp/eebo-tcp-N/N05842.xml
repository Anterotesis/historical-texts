            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE are many who imagine, that unleſs their Performances are dedicated to ſome Great Perſon of the firſt Rank, they looſe their Value, and are ſoon thrown aſide as uſeleſs—yet at the ſame Time are ſo laviſh of their Talents, that they think themſelves hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py if they are indulged the Favour of being quite extravagant in ſtuffing the ſame with ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Complements, but <hi>laughing in their Sleves,</hi> to uſe an old homely Saying, while they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to <hi>ingraciate</hi> themſelves into Favor with thoſe they have <hi>no real Regard for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Author of the following Piece thinks himſelf arriv'd almoſt to the Pinnacle of Honour, that he can take the Liberty, and hopes to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulg'd the Favour, of addreſſing himſelf to a great Number of <hi>Freemen,</hi> (not forgetting the <hi>Clergy,</hi> who I heard was rouſed on this Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as well they might, ſome of whom came to ſee him afterwards, though he was condemn'd without Benefit of Clergy) in whoſe Veins there is yet a <hi>free Circulation</hi> of that noble Blood,

ſome of which was formerly ſpilt, to <hi>procure the Privileges</hi> we now enjoy under the beſt of Kings, and that without the leaſt ECLIPSE, unleſs at ſome particular Times, when Pride and Ambition fires the Breaſts of thoſe who have had ſome <hi>little Share</hi> in the <hi>Honours of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> but quite miſtaking the End and Deſign thereof, have run themſelves into ſuch <hi>wrong Notions</hi> by their intemperate Zeal, which has even vented itſelf upon ſome of thoſe very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Perſons who gave them their Authority; which for want of Skill to conduct properly, or what is worſe, ſuch an high Opinion of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that <hi>Reaſon</hi> for a while has been <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thron'd,</hi> and the Imagination they have had of Power above all Law and Reaſon, has taken Place.—As I am now only ſpeaking of what has been in Times paſt, I hope no one will think I am aiming at any Perſon's Conduct in the preſent Government of Affairs—No, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, this is only to put you upon your Guard; I have not the falſe Complaiſance to Flatter thoſe who I am well aſſured had rather have Truth deliver'd with Simplicity, than only the Appearance thereof in a pompous Stile; and therefore ſhall take the Liberty of ſubſcribing my ſelf your ſincere Friend and humble Servant, while you continue ſtedfaſt, and do not give up your <hi>Birth-Rights.</hi>—</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is cuſtomary for Authors to apologize by Way of Preface to the World for their Writings; and ſurely thoſe of a low Claſs I think, ought never to publiſh without one. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſuch great Men as <hi>Lock, Pope, Dryden, Shakeſpear, Milton,</hi> or <hi>Butler,</hi> need none to their Works, but common Scriblers ſhould offer an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for troubling the Public; which happens to fall to my Lot at this Time. I muſt acknowlege, I ſhould have been glad had I remain'd in <hi>Obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> as I have done for many Years, and ſlid out of this <hi>noiſy World unnoticed:</hi> But as there is an over-ruling Providence, and every Thing will in the End turn to the Advantage of Truth and Honeſty; ſometimes even in this Life, but moſt certainly will in the <hi>future.</hi>—So I deſire to be reſign'd, waiting for the Event.</p>
            <p>But not to be too tedious, or raiſe the Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Reader, with more in my Title and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, than there is in the Book itſelf, ſhall only obſerve, That I doubt not the following Piece will be thought by many, if not all, who peruſe it, to be
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007418_0005_102D8347BA2BC8E0"/>
a <hi>new, remarkable, unprecedented Procedure,</hi> eſpecially as it was done in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation: Therefore ſhall ſubmit this plain, honeſt Account of the whole Matter, to your better Judgment, who ſhall take the Pains to give it a reading; and doubt not all proper Allowance will be made, as it is the firſt Time the Author has taken the Freedom, or rather Courage, to venture without a Pilot, as he would not willingly have any one even <hi>ſuſpected</hi> to be concern'd, leſt it ſhould be accounted a <hi>Libel,</hi> and upon that very <hi>SUSPICION,</hi> be thrown into a ſtinking Stone Goal, though never ſo innocent, and ſuffer in the <hi>ſame Manner</hi> as if he was the <hi>real Author:</hi> without Law, nay, contrary to Law, and in direct Oppoſition even to the poor dim Light of Nature, if I am not very much miſtaken. And as I have experienc'd the ſame for another Perſon (and it may perhaps be the Lot of many more, unleſs divine Providence, in the Uſe of appointed Means, interpoſe) yet I would not wiſh my greateſt Enemy to remain there ſo long, unleſs I was ſure it was lawful to take away his Life, as it had like to have coſt me mine—there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would not publiſh this Affair, if I apprehended any other Perſon would be thought the Author be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides myſelf, or any ways acceſſory thereto; but I am well aſſur'd the plain unpoliſh'd Stile it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in, will convince them to the contrary, and that it is only their bumble Servant,</p>

            <p>PERHAPS there has not any Occurrence for many Years happen'd, eſpecially, in this Country, which has occaſion'd <hi>more Speculation</hi> than a late Proceeding of the Lower Houſe of Aſſembly againſt the Author of the following Piece, only upon <hi>Suſpicion</hi> of his being concern'd in printing and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing a Pamphlet entitled, <hi>The MOMSTER of MON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STERS</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>There has not, ſays the Author of this Pamphlet, to my Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, been any</hi> Monſter <hi>in this Town; nor any Thing like a</hi> Monſter. <hi>There has nothing happened lately which could na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally give Occaſion to ſuch a</hi> Fiction; <hi>nor any Thing to which it can be juſtly apply'd in the Way of Allegorical Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And the Perſons who ſhall attempt this, muſt be very</hi> ſimple, or ill-natur'd, <hi>for it is mercly a</hi> Work of Fancy and Imagination, <hi>of which there is neither Type nor Antitype. And having declar'd this, I think I may innocently let it ſee the Lights, as a very harmleſs, toothleſs Producton, wiſhing that all other</hi> Romancers <hi>and</hi> Storytellers <hi>had been as fair and ingenuous, to undeceive their Readers—Pag. 23.</hi>
               </note>

            <p>Had Expreſſes been immediately diſpatch'd the News could not have flew quicker to the moſt diſtant Parts of the Province, and the other Governments upon the Continent; and no Doubt will be the <hi>Wonder</hi> of our <hi>Mother Country,</hi> when they have a true Account of this notable Affair, which if the Reader will but have Patience a while, he will find it was an <hi>unheard of Attack upon the Liberty of an Engliſhman,</hi> than which ſcarcely any Thing is dearer, if he has but the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007418_0007_102D834BC14D30E0"/>
Spirit of a Man: And as my Antagoniſts in a few Months will become weak as other Men, and looſe their Strength, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> did when his Locks was ſhorne, no one can object, but that I ſhall be upon an Equality with them, ſo that what was done only by a <hi>pretended Power,</hi> (which is no very good Character, when Laws <hi>human</hi> and <hi>divine,</hi> as well as <hi>Reaſon,</hi> are ſet aſide) will have a due Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
            <p>And though it may be thought by ſome, a Freedom not becoming a private Perſon, to complain of a <hi>real</hi> or <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Injury</hi> received by thoſe in Authority, and eſpecially of thoſe who are look'd upon the <hi>Guardians of our Liberty,</hi> and the <hi>Fathers of the Country;</hi> yet when its done with a becoming Modeſty, and proper Deference, ſurely every Man who is born free, and eſpecially the <q>Engliſh, who deſerve the Liberties they enjoy; and are ſo much the more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of them, as they have ſpared no Pains to preſerve them, whoſe Breaſts are all on Fire for Liberty:</q> I ſay, when this is the Caſe, every Man, who has not <hi>juſtly forfeited it,</hi> will think he has a Right to vindicate himſelf, and have the <hi>ſame Satisfaction,</hi> in Proportion, as if the Injury had been done to any <hi>Gentleman of Fortune,</hi> or <hi>high Character in Life,</hi> as an unjuſt Preſident eſtabliſh'd or conniv'd at, may be of <hi>fatal Conſequence</hi> to a free Conſtitation. To uſe the Words of One who ſpeaking of the different Forms of Government in <hi>Europe,</hi> ſays, <q>None of them appears ſo perfect as that of <hi>England:</hi> Here it is that we find united all the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications neceſſary to make the <hi>People happy,</hi> and the <hi>Prince great,</hi> as long as he is <hi>juſt.</hi>
               </q> It was the Opinion of <hi>Solon,</hi> "That a State could not be happy, except the <hi>Magiſtrates were as Subject to the Laws, as private Perſons were to the Magiſtrates.</hi> According to the Sentiments of this venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sage, the Conſtitution of a Government ſhould be ſo framed, as to keep an <hi>Equilibrium</hi> between the People and the Prince." As what I am now writing is only an Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to ſomething of an extraordinary Nature, hope I ſhall be excuſed, and not incur the Cenſure of being too <hi>verboſe,</hi> as perhaps it might give too great a Shock to ſome Perſons,

and would ſcareely be credited, unleſs their Minds were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to receive the Truth before hand, which it my Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And as it is an acknowledged Truth, "That nothing is <hi>ſo dear</hi> to an <hi>honeſt Man,</hi> as his good Name, nor ought he to neglect the juſt Vindication of his Character, when it is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriouſly</hi> attack'd by any;"—ſo this, I think, being my Caſe, I hope to make it appear to every honeſt, unprejudiced Perſon, that I have been moſt ſeverely, cruelly, and unjuſtly treated; and that I have a Right from the Laws of GOD and Man to make my Complaint, without a <hi>partial Reſpect to Perſons;</hi> and no one will have Reaſon to ſay, <hi>I ſpeak Evil of Dignities,</hi> or of the <hi>Rulers of the People;</hi> for I am deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd to ſtick cloſe to the Truth, and certainly that will <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail</hi> with thoſe who have any Regard for their own Freedom, or their Poſterity—</p>
            <p>And though I have had many Thoughts concerning the Publication of this Affair, I now think upon the whole, it is for the beſt; and therefore ſhall give the Publick the Truth, the whole Truth, and nothing but the Truth; for ſhould this be overlook'd, our <hi>Children perhaps may pay Reverence to a grey-headed Error;</hi> therefore this ought not to be wink'd at, leaſt it ſhould take deeper Root;—but as a faithful Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion would act, it ought to be cut out, and thrown away as an <hi>eating Canker,</hi> which in a little Time would eat out the <hi>Vitals</hi> of that <hi>noble Principle of Liberty,</hi> for the Sake of which our <hi>pious Forefathers</hi> ventur'd their <hi>Lives,</hi> and all that was <hi>dear</hi> to them—</p>

                     <p>Daniel Fowle <hi>was brought into the Houſe, and examined, and then was recommitted to their Meſſenger by Order of the Houſe.</hi>

and after my proper Complements before that <hi>Grand Aſſembly,</hi> was interrogated in the following Manner, by Mr. Speaker, viz. <hi>Do you knew any Thing of the Printing this?</hi>—Holding it out—Upon which I deſired it in my own Hands; which was granted:—After looking over it ſeme Time, I ſaid, it
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007418_0012_102D83558E77F2F0"/>
was not of my printing, neither had I any ſuch Letters in my Print-Houſe:—After ſome conſiderable Pauſe, and the Gentlemen looking upon one another, I was aſk'd, <hi>Whether I knew any thing relating to ſaid Book?</hi>—I then deſir'd the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Houſe, Whether I muſt anſwer to that Queſtion? But notwitſtanding this reaſonable Requeſt, there was no Vote paſs'd, that I could perceive, excepting three or four Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſaid <hi>Yes, Yes,</hi> very earneſtly: Upon which I inform'd them, I could not ſay, <hi>I had no Concern;</hi> for as I heard there was ſuch a Pamphlet to ſell, I had bought two Dozen, and ſold them out of my Shop, and ſhould not tho't any Harm if I had ſold an hundred of them. This brought on tne follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Queſtions</hi> and <hi>Anſwers,</hi> viz. <hi>Who did you buy them of?</hi>—I reply'd, they were ſent, I thought, by a young Man, but could not tell his Name.—<hi>Who did he live with?</hi> I then again deſir'd the Opinion of the Houſe, Whether I was oblig'd to tell who I bought of?—Three or four again roſe up and ſaid <hi>I muſt:</hi> Upon which I ſaid, I believ'd the young Man liv'd with Mr. <hi>Royal Tyler.</hi> It was then demanded, <hi>Whether I had any Converſation with him about them?</hi> I reply'd, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I might in the ſame Manner as I had with many others, not that I imagin'd him the Author, or any other Perſon, for I never agreed with any Body about the Printing of it, neither was it ever offer'd to me. I was then aſk'd, <hi>Whether any of my Hands aſſiſted in the doing of it?</hi> I anſwer'd, I believe my Negro might, as ſometimes he work'd for my Brother. I was then queried, <hi>Whether my Brother had any Help?</hi> I ſaid, No. Then a Gentleman ſaid, <hi>Somebody muſt help him, for one could not print alone:</hi> As this was what I never knew before, I reply'd, one could print, and I could do five hundred with my own Hands.—I was next queſtion'd, <hi>Whether I ever ſaw any of it while printing?</hi> As I was determin'd to ſhew no Contempt of Authority, I acknowtedg'd I had ſeen ſome of it printing off, as Printers tranſiently go into one another's Houſes.—<hi>Whoſe Houſe was it?</hi>—I think it was my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's—<hi>What is his Name?</hi>—Zechariah—<hi>Where does he live?</hi> Down by Croſs-Street.—One Gentleman ſtood up and ſaid, <hi>ſometime ago I ſaid I bought but two Dozon,</hi> afterwards
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:007418_0013_102D83580D2A8778"/>
                  <hi>I bought a hundred;</hi> to which I reply'd, <hi>I would</hi> have bought a hundred if I could have ſold them. Another then ſtood up and ſaid, before I had Time to anſwer, YOU DO NOT KNOW WHEN YOU LIE: Upon which I ſaid, Begging your Pardon, Sir, <hi>I know when I</hi> LIE, <hi>and what a Lie is as well as your ſelf:</hi> to which there was no Reply.</p>
               <p>They then concluded I was the Author, as I could bring no Body elſe—I deſired I might have a little Time to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as the Book was publiſh'd ſeveral Months paſt, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I might give more Light in the Affair; but inſtead of tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me to go to my Print-Houſe to enquire who brought the Books there, I was <hi>lock'd up for three Hours in the upper Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Court-Houſe:</hi> Then was ordered down to make my Appearance before the Hon. Houſe a ſecond Time, and was further examined relating to this MONSTROUS BU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SINESS, to know if I could ſay any thing more, or give any further Light; (I underſtood Mr. ROYAL TYLER had been ſent for, and examin'd in my Abſence) but as I had nothing to correct in my Anſwers before, told them I could not give any further Light.—Upon which one ſtood up and ſaid, <hi>when I was in the Houſe before, I ſaid that I bought the Books of</hi> ROYAL TYLER;—Here I was ſuſpicious they intended to get me to acknowledge I had them of him. Which was not true in Fact. I deny'd and ſaid I believe his Boy left them at the Shop. Which I find alſo I am miſtaken in. And after being oblig'd to repeat over great Part of what I had before ſaid, was <hi>ordered again in the above Loft,</hi> where I was confin'd till between nine and ten o'Clock at Night, without Company or Priſoners Fare—From thence was ordered, <hi>Malefactor-like,</hi> attended with a Crowd of Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators, who were waiting at the Doors, to know the <hi>Event of the Monſter,</hi> to his Majeſty's Goal in <hi>Boſton;</hi> as ſoon as I was <hi>guarded</hi> to the Priſon-Keeper's Houſe, many Friends came to ſee me, endeavouring to keep up my Spirits; but no one imagin'd what was to follow, nor I myſelf;—but every one concluded, as Security enough was offer'd, that I might have the beſt Chamber and Bed in the Priſon-Keeper's Houſe; a while after my neareſt Friends withdrew, and wiſh'd me a

good Night. It being now between 11 and 12 at Night, we came to the Point in Hand, <hi>whether I muſt actually go into the Goal;</hi> I was told I muſt, and that into the <hi>Stone-one;</hi> this I ſaid was <hi>cruel hard;</hi> but go I muſt and did; where I now am an Engliſhman, free born; having been for <hi>many Years entitled to the Privilege of voting for ſome of the Members of that very Houſe,</hi> by whoſe Order I am now committed for no other Reaſon, but upon SUSPICION of printing and publiſhing the aforeſaid Book entitled the MONSTER <hi>of</hi> MONSTERS;<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>This Affair was thought of ſo much Conſeqnence to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, that the 25th of</hi> October <hi>being the next Day,</hi>
                     <p>Reſolved, <hi>That the Houſe will now take under Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration the Affair of</hi> Daniel Fowle, <hi>now in his Majeſty Goal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Reſolved, <hi>That it appears to this Houſe, that</hi> Daniel Fowle <hi>has been concerned in pnbliſhing a Scandalous Pamphlet, intitled,</hi> The Monſter of Monſters; <hi>in which the Houſe are greatly reflected on in Breach of their Privileges.</hi> Vot. <hi>p.</hi> 67.</p>
                     <p>October 26, <hi>The Meſſenger of the Houſe inform'd the Speaker that</hi> Royal Tyler <hi>requeſted that he might appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Houſe before they adjourned: He was accordingly admittod into the Houſe, and repreſented, that his Family was in diſtreſſed Circumſtances, and pray'd he might be admitted to Bail. Whereupon</hi> Mr. Speaker, <hi>by Order of the Houſe, declared to him, he might return to his Family, provided he gave his Word of Honour to the Houſe, he would be forth coming when by them required: which he accordingly did, and then withdrew.</hi> See Printed Votes of the Houſe, P. 69.</p>
                  </note>—but as I have heard of many Wonders in the World, this ſeems to be the WONDER of WONDERS; and I think from this Time I ſhall never more wonder at any Thing;—But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome may ſay, this is only a Whim, a Fancy of ſome Lunatick Perſon, who imagin'd this Thing while he was dreaming of MONSTERS. Can it be true in Fact! Is it poſſible under the <hi>Engliſh Conſtitution!</hi> Is it poſſible among a <hi>Free People!</hi> Eſpecially is it any way likely among <hi>New-England Subjects!</hi> Search for a Parralel in all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Records!

                  <hi>dead;</hi> the firſt ſtiring of any Thing I could hear, was the Noiſe of Rats, which ſeem'd to be of a prodigious Size, and have Reaſon to think if I had been favour'd with a Club, I might have been the Death of ſome of them. As I was now depriv'd of all <hi>human Company,</hi> I wiſhed for my little Dog <hi>Corriden,</hi> and was ſorry I had not thought of him before, whoſe Company perhaps I might have been indulg'd. About two o'Clock I heard a moſt <hi>terrible Groan</hi> as of ſome human Perſon, which ſtartled me a little, but had Reſolution enough I thought, to encounter, had it been One from the other World; the <hi>Groan appear'd to be very long and piercing:</hi> In a few Minutes after, I ſpoke out with as ſtrong a Voice as I could, <hi>Who's there!</hi> This ſeem'd to bring the <hi>Dead to Life;</hi> for I ſoon found I had rouſed the Priſoners in the other Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and was immediately anſwer'd by one who ſaid his Name was <hi>Wyer, I ſuppoſe you have heard of me;</hi> he was to have been executed the Thurſday following. I told him I was ſorry for his Misfortune; and adviſed him to behave ſutably under his Affliction; he thank'd me, and bid me a good Night; he was in the next Room; only a Plank Partition parted us. Soon after I was hail'd by one in the upper Loft, whoſe Name is <hi>Webb,</hi> to know if I had juſt come in, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired I would not take it amiſs, as Priſoners were as kind to one another as the Place would allow of; I then told him between eleven and twelve. From that Time till eight the next Morning, I had no more Converſation with any Body; ſoon after I heard <hi>Wyer</hi> at Prayer, who ſeem'd to be very peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, then there was a general Muſter of the Priſoners, and calling to one another, ſome for <hi>Tobacco;</hi> ſome for <hi>Rum, Sugar, Water,</hi> &amp;c. ſome <hi>Swearing, Crying</hi> and <hi>Praying;</hi> ſo that I was entertained with a Variety, which ſeem'd as though I had got into another World. As I found my Companions muſt be <hi>Murderers, Thieves, common Cheats,</hi> &amp;c. I imagin'd I might make a good Improvement by converſing with theſe notorious Sinners: And though it is ſaid <hi>a Man may be known by his Company;</hi> yet I beg Leave to contradict that general prevailing Notion, and differ from ſome; I think there is an Advantage in being with all Sorts of Perſons, if Prudence is

uſed and the Place does not ſtink too much. Had I not been here, I ſhould not have known the Behaviour of a poor Melefactor bound in Chains; I ſhould not have had ſo clear an Idea of that <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Reſignation,</hi> which is ſo much talk'd of, and ſo little practiſed in the World. I than deſired the Priſon Keeper to remove me any where in the Priſon, ſo I might get out of this Place, for I was <hi>almoſt ſuffocated with the Smell.</hi> He told me he could not, unleſs I went above with <hi>Webb;</hi> which I readily accepted of; and in about two Hours after was removed; which Place was <hi>pleaſant</hi> in Compariſon of the other. I indeavour'd now to make the beſt of my companion; and though I had heard a <hi>notorious Character of him,</hi> muſt ſay, he behaved to me with all the Civility of a good natur'd Man.</p>
               <p>*¶* Is it not very unaccountable, as this Affair took up ſo much Time, and was carried on with <hi>ſo much Deliberation,</hi> that it was <hi>never</hi> ſent up to the Honourable Board, to know if his <hi>Excellency</hi> and <hi>Honours,</hi> (who are two Branches of the Legiſlature) approved of it? Had this been done, as I think it ſhould, with Submiſſion to better Judgment; and had I been ſo happy as to have been favour'd with their Opinion, doubt not it would have met with but a <hi>very cool Reception,</hi> and finally thrown out, as not being for the <hi>Dignity of the General Aſſembly</hi> to take Notice of ſuch an <hi>imaginary Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> or if in their Wiſdom ſhould have thought otherwiſe, I cannot entertain the leaſt Doubt but that the Law would have been the Rule for my Trial, and that it could never find Place in the Heart of a ſincere and upright Chriſtian of <hi>proſecuting it to Effect</hi> in the Manner it was done.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I was ordered half a Hour ago by the Priſon-Keeper to come out of the cloſe Stone-Goal, into his Dwelling-Houſe, I think it neceſſary imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to give ſome further Account of this <hi>extraordinary Affair,</hi> which is not mention'd fully in my firſt and ſecond Papers.</p>
               <p>I have been 48 <hi>Hours confin'd in a ſtinking cloſe Stone-Goal,</hi> a particular Account of which I gave in my ſecond Paper. It is now more than ever before a <hi>pleaſant Thing for my Eyes to behold the Sun.</hi> I am now allow'd the Uſe of Pen, Ink, Paper, the Pleaſure of ſeeing my Relations, and many Friends, whom before I knew nothing of. I ſeem to myſelf as <hi>one almoſt riſen from the Dead,</hi> and though weak in Body, can perceive a Revival as I have the Liberty of <hi>breathing a freer Air.</hi> While I was in Tribulation, I am inform'd the <hi>People were in Doubt, ſaying one to another, What meaneth this?</hi> And tho' I had not the Uſe of the Bible, I cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, whether that in particular was forbid me.</p>
               <p>But as I have had many Thoughts, ſome Parts of Scripture came freſh in my Mind, ſuch as, "if this Counſel or this Work be of Men, it will come to Nought;" And that "there is no Wiſdom nor Underſtanding, nor Counſel againſt the LORD." I was inform'd <hi>about Midnight,</hi> that the Jaylor had received a ſtrict Charge to <hi>

his Fellow-Sufferers, "They have beaten (<hi>or abuſed</hi>) us openly uncondemn'd (<hi>i.e. by the Law</hi>) being <hi>Romans,</hi> and have caſt us into Priſon; and now do they thruſt us out pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily? Nay, verily, but let them come themſelves and fetch us out:" Perhaps their hard Hearts may relent, when they ſee the Situation we are in, as it is natural for <hi>the Eye to affect the Heart.</hi> So it is applicable in ſome Meaſure to my Caſe, as I was put into the <hi>inner Room</hi> in the Priſon, and that at <hi>Midnight, uncondemn'd,</hi> i.e. by the Law; and I am an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhman,</hi> free-born, not having forfeited my Liberty any more than the <hi>above Romans;</hi> and I now deſire that the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority that put me in, would by Virtue of that ſame Power take me out, and not thruſt me out privily. I had heard that the Chief Magiſtrate, and ſome others, gave this good Advice; <hi>Take heed to yourſelves, what ye intend to do as touching thoſe Man.</hi> If any ſhould ſay <hi>I am mad, or beſide my ſelf;</hi> it could not be wondered at conſidering the Treatment I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly received; but I can affirm with all ſeriouſneſs in the Words of <hi>St. Paul, I am not mad, but ſpeak forth the Words of Truth and Soberneſs.</hi> I only ſpeak freely, and <hi>every Man of common Senſe</hi> has this Right, and I think every Man is more or leſs concern'd in an Affair of this Nature, <hi>for this Thing was not done in a Corner,</hi> unleſs it was in a Corner of the Court-Houſe. I did nothing that was worthy of Death or of Bonds, the <hi>former</hi> I was in great Danger of, the <hi>latter</hi> I actually experienced; when at the ſame Time I ought to have been ſet at Liberty. I have Reaſon to think twenty four Hours more would have put an End to my Life, for I had catch'd a prodigious Cold the firſt Night, as the Wind blew hard in upon me the whole Time; and had that been the Caſe, <hi>what Satisfaction</hi> could have been made to injur'd Innocence? Would it have been any Mitigation, becauſe it was done by the Repreſentatives of the People, or at leaſt by a Number of them? No! the Crime would have been ſo much the more aggravated, as it cannot be ſuppoſed they were ignorant of what they were doing, though I have ſo much Charity as to think that <hi>forty Men of ſuperior Senſe then ſetting,</hi> would ſooner have <hi>cut off</hi> their Hands than been
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:007418_0024_102D836D02219BC8"/>
guilty of ſuch a <hi>baſe Action;</hi> but ſuppoſe moſt Votes carried it.</p>
               <p>After I was deliver'd from this doleful, melancholly Stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Place, into Mr. <hi>Young's</hi> Dwelling Houſe, I had a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Account of the Doctor's attending my Wife, who on this Occaſion, was thrown into <hi>Fainting Fits,</hi> and <hi>Heſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terick Diſorders,</hi> of which perhaps ſhe may never recover ſo as to be the ſame Woman as before. Here is a further Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of this <hi>unprecedented Conduct</hi> of thoſe who had no Right to put me there, as I hope I ſhall be able to prove—The whole Time ſhe was <hi>forbid Admittance,</hi> who would willingly have kept with me: How then muſt this appear to a thinking Mind, that the dearer Part of a Man's Self muſt be as it were torn from him, which <hi>God had join'd together, and no Man had a Right to put aſunder,</hi> excepting in ſome particular Caſes, of which there can no Shadow of a Reaſon be pretended here. I could only hear while in Goal, the tender <hi>Cries of an aged Mother,</hi> for the Sight of her Son, the Interceſſion of Friends for a Relief, and the encouraging Words of ſome to keep up a good Heart; and the Pity of the poor Melefactor, who ſaid, he thought I was worſe off than himſelf. Soon after I had got into the Priſon-Keeper's Houſe, being weak in Body, and ſcarcely able to walk, my dear Companion, with Aſſiſtance, came in, whoſe <hi>Paleneſs and quivering Lips, with Trembling,</hi> was enough to move a Stoick. Here, I acknowlege, I want Words to paint this Scene in <hi>true and lively Colours;</hi> and as I imagine Language, were I capable, would only eclipſe a true Idea of it, ſo I think nothing but a compleat Orator, a Maſter of Language, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly acquainted with human Nature, <hi>can draw it to its Life;</hi> therefore ſhall forbear.</p>
               <p>The Day being now far ſpent, and my Friends taking their Leave, I retired to a Chamber, and went to Reſt as ſoon as I could; having a tolerable Night's Refreſhment, I awoke with conſiderable Strength of Body, heard two Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons preach'd to the poor Melefactor; as there was a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Perſons came to ſee the Priſoner on this Occaſion, there was Enquiry, <hi>how I came out.</hi> I alſo heard the Houſe had ſent for the <hi>Mittemus</hi> on Saturday, and that the Sheriff
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:007418_0025_102D836F2ABB3198"/>
would not give up the Orignal, for I was not under Bonds, nor any Body for me, that I ſhould not depart the Priſon-Yard; and the Doors and Gates being <hi>frequently open</hi> I had opportunity enough to go out, but being determin'd to ſhow no Contempt of Authority, nor any other Orders, am now, on Monday, (October 28.) ſtill confin'd waiting for the Pleaſure of the Hon.

                     <hi>Having had my Trial before the Lower Houſe, and</hi> ſuſpected <hi>to be guilty, on Tueſday the fifth Day after Confinement, it was "Ordered,</hi> that <hi>Daniel Fowle</hi> be brought to the Bar of the Houſe, and Reprimanded by the Speaker, for his publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Scandalous Libel, called, <hi>the Monſter of Monſters,</hi> greatly reflecting upon the Honour of this Houſe; and then be diſcharged, <hi>paying Coſts.</hi>
                     <p>The ſaid <hi>Daniel Fowle</hi> was accordingly brought to the Bar of the Houſe, and Reprimanded by the Speaker.</p>

               <p>This Affair, I underſtand, is the chief Topick of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in Town, and well it may be, for it is a new Thing in the Land. As I live under the Conſtitution of <hi>England,</hi> ſhall tranſcribe a few Thoughts out of that approved Piece, entitled the <hi>Spirit of Laws,</hi> Vol. 1. P. 216, and ſo on.—</p>
               <p>"The Liberty of the Subject is a Tranquility of Mind, ariſing from the Opinion each Perſon hath of his Safety. In order to have this Liberty, it is requiſite the Government be ſo conſtituted as <hi>one Man</hi> need not be <hi>afraid of another."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Legiſlative and Executive Powers are <hi>united, in the ſame Perſon,</hi> or in the ſame <hi>Body of Magiſtrates,</hi> there can be <hi>no Liberty;</hi> becauſe Apprehenſions may ariſe, leaſt the ſame Monarch or Senate ſhould enact <hi>tyrannical Laws,</hi> to execute them in a tyrannical Manner."</p>
               <p>"Again, There is <hi>no Liberty,</hi> if the <hi>Power of judging</hi> be not <hi>ſeparated</hi> from the Legiſlative and Executive Powers. Were it join'd with the Legiſlative, the Life and Liberty of

It may not be amiſs here to tranſcribe ſome Paſſages of that excellent Book, entitled the <hi>Engliſh Liberties;</hi> or, The <hi>Free-born Subjects Inheritance:</hi> The Author, in his Preface ſays, "Let us then by peruſing this Treatiſe deeply imprint in <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  <note n="*" place="bottom">MAGNA CHARTA, <hi>Pag. 22. Chap. 29. This excellent</hi> Charter <hi>was read at Weſt-minſter Hall in Preſence of the Nobility and Biſhops, with</hi> lighted Candles <hi>in their Hands, the King all the while laying his Hand on his Breaſt, and at laſt</hi> ſolemnnly <hi>Swearing faithfully and inviolably to obſerve all the Things therein contained, as he was a Man, a Chriſtian, a Soldier, and a King. Then the Biſhops extinguiſhed their Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, throwing them on the Ground, crying,—Thus let him be extinguiſhed and ſtink in Hell, who</hi> violates <hi>this Charter. It was thought to be ſo beneficial to the Subject, and a Law of ſo great equity, in Compariſion of thoſe which were formerly in Uſe, that King</hi> Henry, <hi>for the granting it, had the fifteenth Penny of all the moveable Goods both Temporal and Spiritual.</hi> Cham. <hi>Dict.

We will ſell to no Man, we will not deny or defer to any Man, either Juſtice or Right.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No Freeman ſhall be taken,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe Words deſerve to be written in Letters of Gold, and I have often wondered
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:007418_0028_102D837486B0EBD0"/>
that they are not inſcribed in CAPITALS, in all our <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Judicature, Town-Halls</hi> and moſt <hi>publick Edifices;</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo eſſential to our Engliſh Freedom and Liberties, and becauſe my <hi>Lord Coke</hi> in the ſecond Part of his <hi>Inſtitutes,</hi> has many excellent Obſervations on this Chapter; I ſhall recite his very Words;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That no free Man ſhall be taken, or impriſoned, but by the Law of the Land,</hi> i. e. by the Common Law, or by the Statute Law, for the <hi>Liberty</hi> of a <hi>Man's Perſon</hi> is more dear to him than any Thing, and therefore if he be <hi>wronged</hi> in the Liberty, 'tis very reaſonable be ſhould be relieved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No Man ſhall diſſeiſed,</hi> i. e. put out of Seiſin or be diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of his Freehold, i. e. of his <hi>Lands</hi> or <hi>Tenements,</hi> or <hi>Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood,</hi> or of his <hi>Liberties,</hi> or <hi>Free-Cuſtoms,</hi> which belong to him as his <hi>Birth-right,</hi> unleſs it be by Lawful Judgment, i. e. by a Verdict of his Equals, or Men of his own Condition, or by the <hi>Law of the Land,</hi> i. e. to ſpeak once for all, <hi>by the due Courſe and Proceſs of Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No Man ſhall be taken,</hi> &amp;c. i. e. reſtrained of his Liberty, by Petition, or Suggeſtion, to the King or Council, unleſs it be by Indictment or Preſentment, of good and lawful Men, living near the Place where ſuch Deeds were done. The Warrant or <hi>Mittimus,</hi> containing a Lawful Cauſe, ought to have a Lawful Concluſion, &amp;c. and him ſafely to keep until he be delivered by Law, &amp;c. and <hi>not</hi> until the <hi>Party commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> ſhall farther Order.</p>
               <p>If any Man, by <hi>Colour of Authority</hi> where he hath not any in that <hi>particular Caſe,</hi> ſhall perſume to arreſt or impriſon any Man, or cauſe him to be arreſted or impriſoned, this is againſt this Act, and it is <hi>moſt hateful,</hi> when it is done by <hi>Countenance of Juſtice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are three Things, which the Law of <hi>England</hi> (which is a Law of Mercy) principally regards and taketh Care of, viz. <hi>Life, Liberty</hi> and <hi>Eſtate.</hi> Next to a Man's Life, the neareſt Thing that concerns him, is <hi>Freedom of his Perſon;</hi> for indeed what is Impriſonment, but a kind of <hi>civil Death?</hi> Therefore, faith <hi>Forteſcus,</hi> the Laws of <hi>England</hi> do, in <hi>all Caſes,</hi> favour Liberty."</p>

If the Impartial ſhould think upon peruſing the foregoing, that I have wrote with any unbecoming Paſſion or Prejudice, I am willing to acknowlege it. But at the ſame Time muſt obſerve, to uſe the Words of an excellent Writer, "All <hi>Anger</hi> or <hi>Reſentment</hi> cannot be condemned, although there is little lovely in any Degree of it. An intire Inſenſibility of <hi>all injuries,</hi> of which there are but few Inſtances, would be a very inconvenient Diſpoſition; expoſing a Man to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnelies and Petulance of others; nor conſiſtent with his own Character."</p>
               <p>Is it not very ſurpriſing, ſuch a Vote ſhould paſs that Houſe, when I declar'd the Book was not of my printing, neither had I any ſuch Types to print with? If it be ſaid it was put to Vote, and there was a Majority for my Committment, and Mr. Speaker was ordered to ſign a Mittemus to put me into the Common Goal, I think he might with as much Propriety have ſign'd my <hi>Death Warrant</hi> if order'd. If it then be ſaid, Mr. Speaker was againſt this Proceeding, could he not in a genteel Manner have excuſed himſelf, and deſired the Houſe to appoint another for this Caſe, and conſidered if he did me Wrong, though by their Influence, or Order, it would not excuſe him, unleſs they had an abſolute Power to take away Life at Pleaſure—[I here ſhall inſert that Paſſage in the Engliſh Liberties, Pag. 3. "'Tis true the Law itſelf affirms, the King can do no Wrong; which proceeds not only from a Preſumption, that ſo excellent a Perſon will do none, but alſo becauſe he acts nothing but by Miniſters, which (from the loweſt to the higheſt) are anſwerable for their Doings; ſo that if a King in his Paſſion ſhould command <hi>A</hi> to kill <hi>B,</hi> without Proceſs of Law, <hi>A</hi> may yet be proſecuted by Indictment, or upon an Appeal, (where no Royal Pardon is allowable) and muſt for the ſame be executed, ſuch Command notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding."] Would he in Fact have done it, had I been his Son in Law, though ordered by the whole General Aſſembly? No I dare ſay, he would not; and he certainly muſt know, or at leaſt ought to know, in order to qualify him for that Office, I was not dealt with in a <hi>due Courſe and Proceſs of Law;</hi> and that their Power did not extend, in ſuch Caſes to
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:007418_0030_102D83791ACA5E30"/>
any but their own Members. All I 'deſir'd was a fair Trial at Common Law, which I doubt not is founded upon Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and if I had been condemn'd, would have endeavoured to be calm and eaſy, and thrown them in the Heap of Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes Mankind are ſubject to.</p>
               <p>If this was a juſt Method of Proceeding, why was not the other Printers ſent for, and againſt whom Warrants were iſſued? It ſeems there was no Occaſion for this; but if they could ſacrifice an innocent Perſon, it might be a Terror to others. Is this juſt? Has it the Appearance of Juſtice! Nay, would any of them have carried the Affair to ſuch a monſtrous Heighth with a Relation or an Acquaintance? Would Mr. Speaker have ſign'd that Mittimus had I been nearly allied to his Family? It is unaccountable, that a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who for ſeveral Years has had almoſt the unanimous Vote of this Town to repreſent them, ſhould act thus, when he muſt know our Liberties Were <hi>touch'd to the Quick;</hi> (for I would not in the leaſt imagine he could be IGNORANT) and that the plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> of eſtabliſhing ſuch a Precedent would be this: If I can be <hi>ſecure,</hi> or <hi>protected,</hi> I will do all in my Power to put every Man into the Stone Goal that ſhall pretend either directly or indirectly to find Fault with the Conduct of the Houſe of Repreſentatives, while I am Speaker, even if they <hi>barely ſuſpected;</hi> and whatever they order, I will ſign, and we will be Judges of <hi>Parallels</hi> and <hi>Innuendoes,</hi> though we ſhould incur the Cenſure of <hi>Juvenal,</hi> who ſays, "There are a <hi>Sett of Creature</hi> Who have <hi>no Mercy on Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> and are ready to <hi>anſwer,</hi> even when they are <hi>abſolute</hi> Strangers to the <hi>Subject."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Strange! That Men who have had Liberty and Property continuallly ſounding in their Ears from the Preſs and Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit; even from their Infancy, ſhould be guilty of this unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable Conduct? Is the Nature of <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Wrong</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered? Is this Glory departing from <hi>New-England</hi> which our Renowned Predeceſſors purchaſed with ſo much Blood and Treaſure? We hope not. We have our Courts of Juſtice not yet overthrown: For we have the Grand Privilege of <hi>Trials,</hi> by our Country, that is by <hi>Juries;</hi> and I hope never to ſee
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:007418_0031_102D837B03E5F0A8"/>
the Day, when the People of this Country, will be ſo <hi>ſtupid</hi> as <hi>tamely</hi> to give up the Privilege they of Right enjoy; but always have a Godly Jealouſy, when there is the leaſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment either in <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Religious</hi> Affairs, and more eſpecially when the very <hi>Foundation</hi> is ſtruck at; and act like Men; fear not ſtern Countenances, the Threats of a Priſon, nor the rattling of Chains; but imitate the noble Courage of your Fathers, who are now ſleeping quietly in the Duſt, and fear'd none of theſe Things, as they knew they were acting in a juſt Cauſe; and have overcome, and no Doubt gain'd the Prize: For ſhould you act an <hi>inglorious</hi> Part, and they, could riſe out of their Graves, you would not be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged as their Children, but the <hi>degenerate Plants</hi> of a ſtrange Vine.</p>
               <p>Now while we have Opportunity, let us conſider, that as <hi>Life</hi> once loſt, can never be recovered; ſo when <hi>Liberty</hi> is baniſh'd, or by bad Treatment, takes it Flight to another Climate, where it will be kindly receiv'd, it's almoſt as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to recover it again in its native Beauty, as it is for the <hi>Ethiopian to change his Skin, or the Leopard his Spot.</hi>
