            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>IN religious matters we eaſily run into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes. Nothing is more common than to ſee people embracing one error, under the plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible pretence of avoiding another.</p>
                  <p>Many, through fear of infidelity, during the night of ignorance and ſtorm of paſſion, run againſt the wild rocks of ſuperſtition and enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm; and frequently do it with ſuch force, that they <hi>make ſhipwreck of the faith,</hi> and have little of <hi>godlineſs</hi> left, except a few broken pieces of its <hi>form.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Numbers, to ſhun that fatal error, ſteer quite a contrary courſe: Suppoſing themſelves guided by the compaſs of reaſon, when they only fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that of prejudice, with equal violence they daſh their ſpeculative brains againſt the oppoſite rocks of deiſm and profaneneſs; and fondly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate themſelves on eſcaping the ſhelves of fanaticiſm, whilſt the leaky bark of their hopes is ready to ſink, and that of their morals is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſunk already. Thus, both equally over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look ſober, rational, heart-felt piety, that lies between thoſe wide and dangerous extremes.</p>

                     <p>IN every religion there is a principal truth or error, which, like the firſt link of a chain, neceſſarily draws after it all the parts, with which it is eſſentially connected. This leading principle, in Chriſtianity diſtinguiſhed from De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, is the Doctrine of our corrupt and loſt eſtate: for if man is not <hi>at variance</hi> with his Creator, what need of a <hi>Mediator</hi> between God and him? If he is not a <hi>depraved, undone</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, what neceſſity of ſo wonderful a <hi>Reſtorer</hi> and <hi>Saviour</hi> as the Son of God? If he is not <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved</hi> to ſin, why is he <hi>redeemed</hi> by Jeſus Chriſt? If he is not <hi>polluted,</hi> why muſt he be <hi>waſhed in the blood of</hi> that immaculate <hi>Lamb?</hi> If his ſoul is not <hi>diſordered,</hi> what occaſion is there for ſuch
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017930_0011_0FA37E37BAA9D280"/>
a divine <hi>Phyſician?</hi> If he is not <hi>helpleſs</hi> and <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable,</hi> why is he perpetually invited to ſecure the <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> and <hi>conſolations</hi> of the Holy Spirit? And, in a word, if he is not <hi>born in ſin,</hi> why is a <hi>new birth</hi> ſo abſolutely neceſſary, that Chriſt declares with the moſt ſolemn aſſeverations, <hi>without it no man can ſee the kingdom of God?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This doctrine then being of ſuch importance, that genuine Chriſtianity ſtands or falls with it; it may be proper to ſtate it at large; and as this cannot be done in ſtronger or plainer words, than thoſe of the ſacred writers, and our pious reformers; I beg leave to collect them, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the reader with a picture of our natural eſtate, drawn at full length by thoſe antient and maſterly hands.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. Moſes, who informs us, that <hi>God created man in his own image, and after his likeneſs,</hi> ſoon caſts a ſhade upon his original dignity, by giving us a ſad account of his fall. He repreſents him after his diſobedience, as a criminal under ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death; a wretch filled with guilt, ſhame, dread and horror; and a vagabond, turned out of a loſt paradiſe into a <hi>curſed</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, where all bears the ſtamp of deſolation for his ſake. Gen. iii. 17. In conſequence of this apoſtacy he died, and <hi>all die in him: for, by one man ſin entered into the world, and death by ſin; and ſo death paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinned</hi> in him, who was all mankind ſeminally and federally collected in one individual. 1 Cor. xi. 22. Rom. v. 12.</p>
                     <p>The ſacred hiſtorian, having informed us how the firſt man was corrupted, obſerves, that <hi>he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat a ſon in his own image,</hi> ſinful and mortal like himſelf; that his firſt-born was a murderer;
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:017930_0012_0FA37E3878A582B8"/>
that Abel himſelf offered ſacrifices to avert divine wrath, and that the violent temper of Cain ſoon broke out in all the human ſpecies. <hi>The earth,</hi> ſays he, <hi>was filled with violence—all fleſh had cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted its way—and God ſaw the wickedneſs of man was great in the earth,</hi> ſo great, <hi>that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil, continually.</hi> ONLY <hi>evil,</hi> without any mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of good: And CONTINUALLY, without any intermiſſion of evil. Gen. vi. 5.</p>
                     <p>When the deluge was over, the Lord himſelf gave the ſame account of his obſtinately rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous creature. <hi>The imagination of man's heart,</hi> ſaid he to Noah, <hi>is evil from his youth,</hi> Gen. viii. 21. Job's friends paint us with the ſame colours: One of them obſerves, that <hi>Man it born like the wild aſſes' colt:</hi> And another, that <hi>he is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable and filthy, and drinks iniquity like water.</hi> Job xi. 12. and xv. 16.</p>
                     <p>David doth not alter the hideous portrait: <hi>The Lord,</hi> ſays he, <hi>looked down from heaven upon the children of men; to ſee if there were any, that did underſtand, and ſeek God.</hi> And the reſult of the divine inſpection is: <hi>They are all gone aſide, they are all together become filthy: There is none that doth good, no not one.</hi> Pſ. xiv. 2. Solomon gives a finiſhing ſtroke to his father's draught, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming us, that <hi>Fooliſhneſs is bound in the heart of a child,</hi> and not of a child only, for he adds, <hi>The heart of the ſons of men is full of evil, and while they live, madneſs is in their heart.</hi> Prov. xxii. 15. Eccl. ix. 3.</p>
                     <p>Iſaiah corroborates the aſſertions of the royal Prophets, in the following mournful confeſſions: <hi>All we, like ſheep, have gone aſtray—We are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteouſneſſes are as filthy rags.</hi> Iſa. liii. 6. and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lxiv. 6.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="16" facs="unknown:017930_0013_0FA37E393AEBA9F8"/>Jeremiah confirms the deplorable truth, where he ſays: <hi>The ſin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, and with the point of a diamond; it is graven upon the tables of their hearts.—O Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem waſh thy heart from wickedneſs, that thou mayſt be ſaved.</hi>—For <hi>the heart is deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked: Who can know it?</hi> Jer. iv. 14, and xvii. 1.9.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Prophets delineate mankind in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, impenitent ſtate. And do the Apoſtles dip their pencil in brighter colours? Let them ſpeak for themſelves. The chief of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, that <hi>the natural,</hi> unrenewed <hi>man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives not the things of the Spirit of God,</hi> and that <hi>they are fooliſhneſs to him.</hi> 1 Cor. ii. 14. And he lays it down as matter of fact, that <hi>the carnal mind,</hi> the taſte and diſpoſition of every unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate perſon, <hi>is</hi> not only averſe to goodneſs, but ENMITY itſelf <hi>againſt God,</hi> the adorable fountain of all excellence. A blacker line can hardly be drawn, to deſcribe a fallen, diabolical nature. Rom. viii. 7.</p>
                     <p>Various are the names, which the Apoſtle of the Gentiles gives to our original corruption; and they are all expreſſive of its pernicious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and dreadful effects. He calls it empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically <hi>Sin,</hi> a ſin ſo full of activity and energy, that it is the life and ſpring of all others:—<hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling Sin,</hi> a ſin which is not like the leaves and fruits of a bad tree, that appear for a time, and then drop off; but like the ſap that dwells and works within, always ready to break out at every bud:—<hi>The body of Sin,</hi> becauſe it is an aſſemblage of all the members which conſtitute the human frame:—<hi>The law of ſin,</hi> and <hi>the Law in our members,</hi> becauſe it hath a conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

force, and rules in our mortal bodies, as a mighty tyrant in the kingdom which he hath uſurped:—<hi>The old man,</hi> becauſe we have it from the firſt man, Adam; and becauſe it is as old as the firſt ſtamina of our frame, with which it is moſt cloſely interwoven:—<hi>The fleſh,</hi> as being propagated by carnal generation, and always oppoſing the Spirit, the gracious prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, which we have from Adam the ſecond:— And <hi>Concupiſcence,</hi> that myſtic Jezebel, who brings forth the infinite variety of <hi>fleſhly, worldly,</hi> and <hi>mental luſts, which war againſt the ſoul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor are St. James and St. John leſs ſevere than St. Paul, upon the unconverted man. The one obſerves, that his <hi>wiſdom,</hi> the beſt property naturally belonging to him, <hi>deſcendeth not from above, but is earthly, ſenſual, and deviliſh:</hi> And the other poſitively declares, that <hi>The whole world lieth in wickedneſs.</hi> James iii. 15. 1 John v. 19.</p>
                     <p>Our Lord, whoſe ſpirit inſpired the Prophets and Apoſtles, confirms their lamentable teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. To make us ſeriouſly conſider ſin, our mortal diſeaſe, he reminds us, that <hi>The whole have no need of a Phyſician, but they that are ſick.</hi> Luke v. 31. He declares, that <hi>men love darkneſs rather than light.</hi> That <hi>the world hates him</hi>; and that <hi>its works are evil.</hi> John iii. 19. and xv. 18. and vii. 7. He directs all to pray for the <hi>pardon of ſin,</hi> as <hi>being evil,</hi> and <hi>owing ten thouſand talents</hi> to their heavenly creditor. Mat. vi. 12. vii. 11. xviii. 24. And he aſſures us, that <hi>the things, which defile the man, come from within</hi>; and that <hi>out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, thefts, covetouſneſs, wickedneſs, deceit, laſciviouſneſs, an
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:017930_0015_0FA37E3ABB5FB500"/>
evil eye, blaſphemy, pride, fooliſhneſs,</hi> and, in a word, ALL MORAL EVIL. Mark vii. 21. Mat. xv. 19.</p>
                     <p>Some indeed confine what the ſcriptures ſay of the depravity of the human heart, to the aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned Heathens and perſecuting Jews; as if the profeſſors of morality, and chriſtianity, were not concerned in the dreadful charge. But if the apoſtolic writings affirm, that Chriſt <hi>came not to call the righteous, but</hi> SINNERS; that <hi>he died for the</hi> UNGODLY; and that <hi>he ſuffered, the juſt for the</hi> UNJUST; it is plain that, unleſs he did not ſuffer and die for moral men and chriſtians, they are by nature <hi>ſinners, ungodly,</hi> and <hi>unjuſt</hi> as the reſt of mankind. Rom. v. 6. 1 Pet. 3.18.</p>
                     <p>If this aſſertion ſeems ſevere, let ſome of the beſt men that ever lived, decide the point, not by the experience of immoral perſons, but by their own. <hi>I abhor myſelf,</hi> ſays Job, <hi>and repent in duſt and aſhes.</hi> Job xlii. 6. <hi>Behold, I was ſhapen in iniquity,</hi> ſays David, <hi>and in ſin did my mother conceive me.</hi> Pſ. li. 5. <hi>Wo is me, for I am undone,</hi> ſays Iſaiah, <hi>becauſe I am a man of unclean lips.</hi> Iſa. vi. 5. <hi>I know,</hi> ſays St. Paul, <hi>that in me, that is, in my fleſh, dwelleth no good thing.</hi> Rom. vii. 18. <hi>We ourſelves,</hi> ſays he, to Titus, <hi>were ſometimes fooliſh, diſobedient, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, ſerving divers luſts and pleaſures, living in malice and envy, hateful and hating one another.</hi> Tit. iii. 3. And ſpeaking of himſelf, and the Chriſtians at Epheſus, he leaves upon record, this memorable ſentence: <hi>We were</hi> BY NA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURE <hi>the children of wrath even as others.</hi> Eph. ii. 3. Such humbling thoughts have the beſt men entertained both of their natural eſtate, and themſelves!</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>From the whole, ſpeaking of all mankind in their unregenerate ſtate, he juſtly infers, that <hi>deſtruction and miſery are in their ways.</hi> And, leſt the ſelf-righteous ſhould flatter themſelves,

that this alarming declaration doth not regard them, he adds, that <hi>the ſcriptures conclude</hi> ALL <hi>under ſin</hi>; that <hi>there is no difference, for</hi> ALL <hi>have ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God</hi>; and that <hi>the moral law</hi> denounces a general curſe againſt its violators, <hi>that</hi> EVERY MOUTH <hi>may be ſtopped and</hi> ALL THE WORLD <hi>may become guilty before God.</hi> Rom. iii. 9. to 23. vi. 19. Eph. ii. 2.</p>
                     <p>If man is thus corrupt and guilty, he muſt be liable to condign puniſhment. Therefore, as the Prophets and Apoſtles agree with our Lord, in their diſmal deſcriptions of this depravity; ſo they harmonize with him, in their alarming ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of his danger.

                     </p>
                     <p>Our church is uniform in her woful accounts of man's miſery. Hear her in the 1ſt Homily for Whitſunday: <hi>Man,</hi> OF HIS OWN NATURE (ſince the fall) <hi>is fleſhly and carnal, corrupt and nought, ſinful and diſobedient to God, without any ſpark of goodneſs in him, without any virtuous or godly motion, only given to evil thoughts and wicked deeds.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Homily on the nativity, ſhe ſpeaks thus: <hi>He</hi> (diſobedient man) <hi>was now curſed and abhor'd. Inſtead of the image of God, he was now become the image of the devil, the bond ſlave of hell. Altogether ſpotted and defiled, he ſeemed to be nothing elſe but a lump of ſin; and therefore, by the juſt judgment of God, he was condemned to everlaſting death. Thus, in Adam, all men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came univerſally mortal, having in themſelves nothing but</hi> 
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">Prejudiced perſons, who inſtead of conſidering the entire ſyſtem of truth, run away with a part de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached from the whole, will be offended here, as if our Church "damn'd every body". But the candid Reader will eaſily obſerve, that, inſtead of dooming any one to deſtruction, ſhe only declares, that the Saviour finds all men in a ſtate of condemnation and miſery, where they would eternally remain, were it not for the compaſſionate equity of our gracious God, which does not permit him to ſentence to a <hi>conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of <hi>eternal</hi> torments, any one of his creatures, for a ſin, of which they never were <hi>perſonally</hi> guilty; and of which, conſequently, they can never have any <hi>conſciouſneſs.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>everlaſting damnation of body and ſoul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſame doctrine is delivered with the ſame plainneſs in the 2d part of the Homily on the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:017930_0021_0FA37E3F449585E0"/>
paſſion. <hi>Adam died the death, that is, became mortal, loſt the favour of God, and was caſt out of paradiſe, being no longer a citizen of heaven, but a firebrand of hell, and a bond-ſlave of the devil. And St. Paul bears witneſs, that by Adam's offence death came upon all men to condemnation, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came plain reprobates, and caſt-aways, * being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually damned to the everlaſting pains of hell-fire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Agreeable to this, we are taught, in the 2d part of the Homily on repentance, that <hi>part of that virtue conſiſts in an unfeigned acknowledgement of our ſins to God, whom, by them we have ſo grievouſly offended, that if he ſhould deal with us according to his juſtice, we deſerve a thouſand hells, if there were ſo many.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſame vein of wholeſome, though unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant doctrine runs through the Liturgy of our church. She opens her ſervice by exhorting us <hi>not to diſſemble, nor cloak, our manifold ſins and wickedneſs.</hi> She acknowledges in her confeſſions, that <hi>we have erred and ſtrayed from God's ways like loſt ſheep,</hi>—that <hi>there is no health in us,</hi>—that we are <hi>miſerable ſinners, miſerable offenders, to whom our ſins are grievous,</hi> and <hi>the burden of them is intolerable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>She begins her baptiſmal office by reminding us, that <hi>all men are conceived and born in ſin.</hi> She teaches in her catechiſm, that <hi>we are by nature born in ſin, and the children of wrath.</hi> She con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes in the collect before the general thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, that <hi>we are tied and bound with the chain of our ſins,</hi> and intreats God to <hi>let the pitifulneſs of his great mercy looſe us:</hi> And in her ſuffrages ſhe beſeeches him to <hi>have mercy upon us,</hi> to <hi>ſpare us,</hi> and <hi>make ſpeed to ſave us</hi>; a language that can ſuit none but condemned ſinners.</p>
                     <p>Duly ſenſible of our extreme danger till we

have ſecured an intereſt in Chriſt, at the grave ſhe ſupplicates the <hi>moſt holy God, not to deliver us into the bitter pains of eternal death</hi>; and in the litany ſhe beſeeches our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>by his agony and bloody ſweat, by his croſs and paſſion,</hi> to <hi>deliver us from his wrath and everlaſting dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi> Thus is our church every where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with herſelf, and with the oracles of God, in repreſenting us as corrupt, condemned creatures, in Adam: till we are penitent, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved believers in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>The doctrine to be demonſtrated in this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe being thus fully ſtated, in the conſentaneous words of the ſacred Writers, and our pious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, I ſhall cloſe this part by an appeal to the Reader's candour and common ſenſe.

                     <p>AS no man is bound to believe what is contrary to common ſenſe; if the above-ſtated doctrine appears irrational, Scriptures, Articles, Homilies, and Liturgy, are quoted in vain: When men of parts are preſſed with their authority, they ſtart from it as an impoſition on their reaſon, and make as honourable a retreat as they poſſibly can.</p>

                           <p>If we let our thoughts aſcend, from the little ſufferers, to the mothers that bear them, we ſhall find another dreadful proof of the divine diſpleaſure and of our natural depravity. Does not a good maſter, much more a gracious God, delight in the proſperity and happineſs of his faithful ſervants? If mankind were naturally in their Creator's favour, would he not order the fruit of the womb to drop from it, without any more inconveniency, than ripe vegetables fall
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:017930_0032_0FA37E477972E4D8"/>
from the opening huſk, or full-grown fruit from the diſburdened tree? But how widely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent is the caſe!</p>
                           <p>Fix your attention on pregnant mothers: See their diſquietude and fears. Some go before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand through an imaginary travel, almoſt as painful to the mind, as the real labour is to the body. The dreaded hour comes at laſt. Good God! What lingering, what tearing pains; what redoubled throes, what killing agonies at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it! See the curſe—or rather, ſee it not. Let the daughter of her who taſted the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fruit without the man, drink that bitter cup Without him. Fly from the mournful ſcene, fly to diſtant apartments—But in vain—The din of ſorrow purſues and overtakes you there.</p>
                           <p>A child of man is at the point of being born; his tortured mother proclaims the news in the bittereſt accents. They increaſe with her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing agony. Sympathize and pray, while ſhe ſuffers and groans—Perhaps while ſhe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers and dies: For it is poſſibly her dying groan that reaches your ear. Perhaps nature is ſpent in the hard travel; her ſon is born, and with Jacob's wife, ſhe cloſes her languid eye and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires. Perhaps the inſtruments of death are upon her: The keen ſteel mangles her delicate frame: As Caeſar's mother, ſhe generouſly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers her body to be opened, that her unborn child may not be torn from her in pieces; and the fertile tree is unnaturally cut down, that its fruit may be ſafely gathered.</p>
                           <p>Perhaps neither mother nor child can be ſaved, and one grave is going to deprive a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted mortal of a beloved Rachel, and a long expected Benjamin. If this is the caſe, O Earth! Earth! Earth! conceal theſe ſlain, cover their
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:017930_0033_0FA37E483AE92D40"/>
blood, and detain in thy dark boſom, the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful curſe that brought them there. Vain wiſh! Too active to be confined in thy deepeſt vaults, it ranges through the world: With unrelenting fierceneſs it purſues trembling mothers, and forces them to lift up their voice for ſpeedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief: Though varied according to the accents of an hundred languages, it is the ſame voice, that of the bittereſt anguiſh: And while it is reverberated from hamlet to hamlet, from city to city, it ſtrikes the unprejudiced inquirer, and makes him confeſs, that theſe clouds of unbribed witneſſes, by their loud, conſentaneous evidence, impeach SIN, the tormenter of the woman, and murderer of her offspring.</p>
                           <p>But ſuppoſe the caſe is not ſo fatal, and ſhe is at laſt delivered; her labour may be over, yet not her pain and danger; a lingering weakneſs may carry her ſlowly to her grave. If ſhe reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, ſhe may be a mother, and yet unable to act a mother's part. Her pining child ſucks her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered breaſt in vain: Either the ſprings of his balmy food are dried up, or they overflow with a putrid, loathſome fluid, and excruciating ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers cauſe the ſoft lips of the infant to appear terrible as the edge of the ſword.</p>
                           <p>If ſhe happily eſcapes this common kind of diſtreſs, yet ſhe may date the beginning of ſome chronical diſeaſe, from her dangerous lying-in; and, in conſequence of her hard wreſtling for the bleſſing of a child, may with the patriarch go halting all her days. How ſenſible are the marks of divine indignation, in all theſe ſcenes of ſorrow! And conſequently how viſible our ſinfulneſs and guilt.</p>
                           <p>Nor can the juſtneſs of the inference be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, under pretence that the females of other
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:017930_0034_0FA37E48F96FF2F0"/>
animals, which neither <hi>do</hi> nor <hi>can</hi> ſin, bring forth their young with pain, as well as women. For, if we take a view of the whole earth, we ſhall not ſee any females, except the daughters of Eve, who groan under a periodical diſorder, that intails languor and pain, weakneſs and mortal diſeaſes, on their moſt blooming days. Nor do we in general find any, that are delivered of their offspring with half the ſorrow and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of women. Theſe two remarkable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances loudly call upon us, to look for the cauſe of the ſorrow, which attends the delivery of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male animals, where that ſorrow is moſt ſenſibly felt; and to admire the perfect agreement, that ſubſiſts between the obſervations of natural phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, and the aſſertion of the moſt ancient hiſtorian.

                           <p>If we advert to mankind, even before they burſt the womb of their tortured mothers, they afford us a new proof of their total degeneracy. For reaſon dictates, that if they were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in ſin, the Father of mercies could not, conſiſtently with his goodneſs and juſtice, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the cold hand of death to nip them in the unopened, or juſt opened bud. This neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs happens every hour. Who can number the early miſcarriages of the womb? How many millions of miſerable embrios feel the pangs of death before thoſe of birth, and prepoſterouſly turn the fruitful womb into a living grave? And how many millions more of wretched infants, eſcape the dangers of their birth-day, and ſalute the troubleſome light, only to take their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely leave of it, after languiſhing a few days

on the rack of a convulſive, or torturing diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? I aſk again, Would a good and righteous God ſeal the death-warrant of ſuch multitudes of his unborn, or newly born creatures, if their natural depravity did not render them proper ſubjects of diſſolution?</p>
                           <p>It is true, the young of beaſts ſuffer and die, as well as infants; but it is only becauſe they are involved in our miſery. They partake of it as the attendants of a noble traitor ſhare in his deſerved ruin. Sin, that inconceivable virulent and powerful evil, drew down God's righteous curſe upon all that was created for man's uſe, as well as upon man himſelf. Hence only ſprings the degeneracy and death, that turn beaſts to one promiſcuous duſt with mankind. Compare Gen. iii. 17. Rom. v. 12. and viii. 22. We may then juſtly infer, from the ſufferings and death of ſtill-born or new-born children, that man is totally degenerate, and liable to deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even from his mother's womb.</p>

                           <p>But take your leave of the infant corpſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready buried in the womb, or depoſited in a cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin of a ſpan long; fix your attention on the healthy, ſucking child.

                           <p>Part of the divine image, in which he was made in Adam, conſiſted in purity, power, and knowledge: But now, he is naturally the leaſt cleanly, as well as the moſt helpleſs and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of all animals.

<pb n="39" facs="unknown:017930_0036_0FA37E4A788D0918"/>
ſake of its truth, I would venture to ſhew, that there is no compariſon between the cleanlineſs of the little active animals, which ſuck the filthy ſwine, and of helpleſs infants, who ſuck the purer breaſts of their tender mothers. But, caſting a veil over the dribbling, loathſome, little creatures; without fear of being contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted I aver, that the young of thoſe brutes, which are ſtupid to a proverb, know their dams, and follow them as ſoon as they are dropped; whilſt infants are months without taking any particular notice of their parents, and without being able, I ſhall not ſay to follow them, but even to bear the weight of their ſwaddled body, or ſtand upon their tottering legs.</p>
                           <p>With reference to the knowledge neceſſary for the ſupport of animal life, it is undeniable that brutes have greatly the advantage of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Fowls and fiſhes, immediately and with amazing ſagacity, ſingle out their proper nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, among a thouſand uſeleſs and noxious things: But infants put indifferently to their mouth all that comes to their hand, whether it be food or poiſon, a coral or a knife: And, what is more aſtoniſhing ſtill, grown-up per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſcarce ever attain to the knowledge of the quantity, or quality of the meat and drink, which are moſt ſuitable to their conſtitutions.</p>
                           <p>All diſordered dogs fix at once upon the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary vegetable, that can (in ſome caſes) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their diſtreſs: But many phyſicians, even after ſeveral years ſtudy and practice, hurt and ſometimes kill their patients by improper medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.

                           <p>Again. Other animals are provided with a natural covering, that anſwers the double end of uſefulneſs and ornament: But indigent man is obliged to borrow from plants, beaſts, and worms, the materials with which he hides his nakedneſs, or defends his feebleneſs; and a great part of his ſhort life is ſpent in providing, or putting on and off garments, the gaudy tokens of his ſhame, or ragged badges of his fall.</p>
                           <p>Are not theſe plain proofs, that man, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his ſuperior rank, and primitive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, ſhould in all things have the pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, is now a degraded being, curſed for his apoſtacy with native uncleanlineſs, helpleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ignorance, and nakedneſs above all other animals?</p>

hour in evidencing their love to him and to each other: they ſpent their golden moments in admiring the variety and beauty of his works, finding out the divine ſignatures impreſſed upon them, ſwaying their mild ſcepter over the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent creation, and enjoying the rich, incorrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible fruits, which the earth ſpontaneouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the greateſt perfection and abundance. Thus their pleaſure was without idleneſs or pain, and their employment without toil or wearineſs.</p>
                           <p>But no ſooner did diſobedience open the floodgates of natural evil, than arduous labour came in full tide upon mankind; and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand painful arts were invented to mitigate the manifold curſe, which ſin had brought upon them.</p>
                           <p>Since the fall, our bodies are become vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable and ſhamefully naked; and it is the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of thouſands to make, or ſell all ſorts of garments for our defence and ornament. The earth has loſt her original fertility; and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands more with iron inſtruments open her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, to force her to yield us a maintenance; or with immenſe labour ſecure her precarious, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying fruits: Immoderate rains deprive her of her ſolidity, and earthquakes or deluges deſtroy her evenneſs; numbers therefore are painfully imployed in making or mending roads. Each country affords ſome only of the neceſſaries or conveniencies of life; this obliges the mercantile inhabitants to tranſport, with immenſe trouble and danger, the produce of one place to ſupply the wants of another. We are expoſed to a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of dangers: Our perſons and property muſt be ſecured againſt the inclemency of the weather, the attacks of evil beaſts, and the
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:017930_0046_0FA37E51FB8F0E18"/>
aſſaults of wicked men: Hence the fatigue of millions of workmen in wood and ſtone, metals and minerals; and the toils and hazards of millions more, who live by making, wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or uſing the various inſtruments of war and ſlaughter.</p>
                           <p>Diſorder and injuſtice give riſe to govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, politics, and a labyrinth of laws; and theſe employ myriads of officers, lawyers, magiſtrates, and rulers. We are ſubject to a thouſand pains and maladies; hence myriads more preſcribe and prepare remedies, or attend and nurſe the ſick. Our univerſal ignorance occaſions the tedious labour of giving and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving inſtruction, in all the branches of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and divine knowledge. And to complete the whole, the original tongue of mankind is confounded, and even neighbouring nations are barbarians to each other: From hence ariſe the painful lucubrations of critics and linguiſts, with the infinite trouble of teaching and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing various languages.</p>
                           <p>The curſe introduced by ſin, is the occaſion of all theſe toils.

                           <p>To go no farther than this populous pariſh, with what hardſhips and dangers do our indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent neighbours earn their bread! See thoſe who ranſack the bowels of the earth to get the black mineral we burn: How little is their lot preferable to that of the Spaniſh felons, who work the golden mines?</p>

men have time to proſtrate themſelves; the fiery ſcourge grazes their back, the ground ſhields their breaſts; they eſcape.

Half dead themſelves, they hold their dead or dying companions in their trembling arms. Merciful God of Shadrach! Kind protector of Meſhech! Mighty deliverer of Abednego!

                           <p>Leave theſe black men at their perilous work, and ſee yonder bargemen hauling that loaded veſſel againſt wind and ſtream. Since the dawn of day, they have wreſtled with the impetuous current; and now, that it almoſt overpowers them, how do they exert all their remaining ſtrength, and ſtrain their every nerve! How are they bathed in ſweat and rain! Faſtened to their lines as horſes to their traces, wherein do they differ from the laborious brutes? Not in an erect poſture of body, for in the intenſeneſs of their toil they bend forward, their head is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:017930_0049_0FA37E5437D7E218"/>
and their hands upon the ground. If there is any difference, it conſiſts in this: Horſes are indulged with a colar to ſave their breaſt; and theſe, as if theirs was not worth ſaving, draw without one: The beaſts tug in patient ſilence and mutual harmony; but the men with loud contention and horrible imprecations. O ſin, what haſt thou done! Is it not enough that theſe drudges ſhould toil like brutes, muſt they alſo curſe one another like devils?</p>
                           <p>If you have gone beyond the hearing of their impious oaths, ſtop to conſider the ſons of Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can confined to theſe forges and furnaces. Is their lot much preferable? A ſultry air, and clouds of ſmoke and duſt, are the element in which they labour. The confuſed noiſe of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter falling, ſteam hiſſing, fire-engines working, wheels turning, files creaking, hammers beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ore burſting, and bellows roaring, form the diſmal concert that ſtrikes the ears; while a continual eruption of flames, aſcending from the mouth of their artificial volcanos, dazzle their eyes with an horrible glare. Maſſy bars of hot iron are the heavy tools they handle, cylinders of the firſt magnitude the enormous weights they heave, veſſels full of melted metal the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous loads they carry, ſtreams of the ſame burning fluid the fiery rivers, which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct into the deep cavities of their ſubterraneous moulds; and millions of flying ſparks, with a thouſand drops of liquid, hiſſing iron, the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſhowers to which they are expoſed. See them caſt; you would think them in a bath, and not in a furnace: They bedew the burning ſand with their ſtreaming ſweat: nor are their wet garments dried up, either by the fierce fires
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:017930_0050_0FA37E54F8B93D80"/>
that they attend, or the fiery ſtreams which they manage. Certainly, of all men, theſe have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to remember the juſt ſentence of an offended God: <hi>In the ſweat of thy face ſhalt thou eat thy bread, all the days of thy life.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>All indeed do not go through the ſame toil; but all have their ſhare of it, either in body or in mind. Behold the ſtudious ſon of learning; his intenſe application hath waſted his fleſh, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted his ſpirits, and almoſt dried up his ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical moiſture. Conſider the man of fortune: Can his thouſands a year exempt him from the curſe of Adam? No; he toils perhaps harder in his ſports and debaucheries, than the poor plowman that works his eſtate.</p>
                           <p>View that corpulent epicure, who idles away the whole day, between the feſtal board and the dozing couch. You may think that he, at leaſt, is free from the curſe which I deſcribe: But you are miſtaken: while he is living, as he thinks, a life of luxurious eaſe and gentle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>activity, he fills himſelf with crude humours, and makes way for the gnawing gout and rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gravel. See even now, how ſtrongly he perſpires, and with what uneaſineſs he draws his ſhort breath, and wipes his dewy, ſhining face! Surely he toils under the load of an undigeſted meal. A porter carries a burden upon his brawny ſhoulders; but this wretch has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed one into his ſick ſtomach. He will not work; let him alone, and ere long acute pains will bathe him in as acute a ſweat, as that of the furnace-man; and ſtrong medicines will exerciſe him to ſuch a degree, that he will envy even the collier's lot.</p>

                           <p>To cloſe the horrible proſpect, view the ruins of cities and kingdoms, the calamities of wrecks and ſieges, the horrors of ſea-fights and fields of battle; with all the crimes, devaſtations, and cruelties, that accompany revenge, contention, and war; and you will be obliged to conclude with Job, that corrupt <hi>man is born to trouble as the ſparks fly upward</hi>; with David, that <hi>the earth is full of darkneſs and cruel habitations</hi>; and with every impartial enquirer, that our depravity, and God's juſtice, concur to make this world <hi>a vale of tears,</hi> as well as a field of toil and ſweat; a vaſt priſon for rebels already "tied with the chains of their ſins," a boundleſs ſcaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold for their execution, a golgotha, an <hi>aceldama,</hi> an immenſe <hi>field of</hi> torture and <hi>blood.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Some will probably ſay, "This picture of the world is drawn with black lines, but kinder providence blends light and ſhade together, and tempers our calamities with numberleſs bleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings." I anſwer: It cannot be too thankfully acknowledged, that, while patience ſuſpends the ſtroke of juſtice, God, for Chriſt's ſake, reſtores
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:017930_0055_0FA37E58B8CBA858"/>
us a thouſand forfeited bleſſings, that <hi>his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may lead us to repentance.</hi> But alas! What is the conſequence, where divine grace does not prove victorious over corrupt nature? To all our ſins, do we not add the crime of either en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the favours of providence with the greateſt ingratitude, or of abuſing them with the moſt provoking inſolence.</p>
                           <p>Our actions are far more expreſſive of our real ſentiments, than our words. Why this variety of exquiſite food, ſays the voluptuary, whoſe life loudly ſpeaks what his lips dare not utter? Why this abundance of delicious wines, but to tempt my unbridled appetite, and pleaſe my luxurious palate?—Would God have given ſoftneſs to ſilks, brightneſs to colours, and luſtre to diamonds, ſays the ſelf-applauding ſmile of a fooliſh virgin, who worſhips herſelf in a glaſs? Would he have commanded the white of the lily thus to meet the bluſh of the roſe, and heighten ſo elegant a proportion of features, if he had not deſigned that the united powers of art, dreſs, and beauty, ſhould make me ſhare his divine honours?—Why are we bleſſed with dear children and amiable friends, ſays the ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous behaviour of fond parents and raptured lovers, but that we ſhould ſuſpend our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs on their raviſhing ſmiles, and place them as favourite idols in the ſhrine of our hearts?— And why has heaven favoured me both with a ſtrong conſtitution, and an affluent fortune, ſays the rich ſlave of brutiſh luſts, but that I may drink deeper of earthly joys and ſenſual delights?</p>
                           <p>Thus bleſſings abuſed or unimproved, become curſes in our hands: God's indulgence encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages us to offend him: We have the fatal
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:017930_0056_0FA37E59794CFDB8"/>
ſkill of extracting poiſon from the ſweeteſt flowers; and madly turn the gifts of providence into weapons, to attack our Benefactor and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy ourſelves. That there are then ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted gifts, does not prove that mankind are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, but that <hi>God's patience endureth yet daily,</hi> and that a Saviour <hi>ever liveth to make interceſſion for us.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Should it be farther objected, that "our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures counter-balance our calamities:" I anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer: The greateſt part of mankind are ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with want and cares, toil and ſickneſs, that their intervals of eaſe may rather be termed "an alleviation of miſery," than "an enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of happineſs." Our pains are real and laſting, our joys imaginary and momentary. Could we exerciſe all our ſenſes upon the moſt pleaſing objects, the tooth-ach would render all inſipid and burdenſome; a fit of the gout alone damps every worldly joy, while all earthly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights together cannot give us eaſe under it: So vaſtly ſuperior is the bitterneſs of one bodily pain, to the ſweetneſs of all the pleaſures of ſenſe!</p>
                           <p>If objectors ſtill urge, that "ſufferings are needful for our trial:" I reply, They are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for our <hi>puniſhment</hi> and <hi>correction,</hi> but not for our <hi>trial.</hi> A good king can <hi>try</hi> the loyalty of his ſubjects, without putting them to the rack. Let Nero and Bonner <hi>try</hi> the innocent by all ſorts of tortures, but let not their barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity be charged upon a God ſtrictly juſt, and infinitely good.</p>
                           <p>However, "calamities prove a bleſſing to ſeme."—And ſo does tranſportation: But who ever inferred from thence, that reformed felons were tranſported for the <hi>trial</hi> of their virtue,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:017930_0057_0FA37E5A395F39B0"/>
and not for the <hi>puniſhment</hi> of their crimes? I conclude therefore, that our calamities and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries demonſtrate our corruption, as ſtrongly as the puniſhments of the baſtinado and pillory, appointed by an equitable judge, prove the guilt of thoſe, on whom they are frequently and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely inflicted.</p>

                           <p>Would to God the multiplied calamities of life were a ſufficient puniſhment for our deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate wickedneſs!

                           <p>Guided by their groans and funeral lights, let us proceed to the dreary charnal-houſes and

calvaries, which we decently call <hi>vaults</hi> and <hi>church-yards:</hi> and without ſtopping to look at the monuments of ſome, whom my objector re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members as vigorous as himſelf; and of others, who were perhaps his partners in nightly revels; let us haſten to ſee the duſt of his mouldered an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, and to read upon yonder coffins, the dear name of a parent, a child, perhaps a wife, turned off from his boſom into the gulph of eternity.</p>
                           <p>If this ſight does not convince him, I ſhall open one of the noiſome repoſitories, and ſhew him the deep hollows of thoſe eyes, that darted tender ſenſation into his ſoul; and odious rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles fattened upon the once charming, now ghaſtly face, he doted upon.—But, methinks he turns pale at the very propoſal, and, rather than be confronted with ſuch witneſſes, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, that he is condemned to die, with all his dear relatives, and the whole human race.</p>
                           <p>And is this the caſe? Are we then under ſentence of death? How awful is the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!

And is it not (as being the greateſt of temporal evils) appointed by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and divine laws, for the puniſhment of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital offenders; whether they are named <hi>felons</hi> and <hi>traitors,</hi> or more generally called <hi>men</hi> and <hi>ſinners?</hi> Let matter of fact decide.</p>
                           <p>Whilſt earthly judges condemn murderers and traitors to be hanged or beheaded; does not <hi>the Judge of all,</hi> ſentence ſinful mankind, either to pine away with old age, or be waſted with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions, burned with fevers, ſcalded with hot humors, eaten up with cancers, putrified by mortifications, ſuffocated by aſthmas, ſtrangled by quinſeys, poiſoned by the cup of exceſs, ſtabbed with the knife of luxury, or racked to
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:017930_0059_0FA37E5BB98E8328"/>
death by diſorders as loathſome, and accidents as various as their ſins?</p>
                           <p>If you conſider the circumſtances of their execution, where is the material difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the malefactor and the ſinner? The jailor and the turnkey confine the one to his cell: The diſorder and the phyſician confine the other to his bed. The one lives upon bread and water: The other upon draughts and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſes. The one can walk with his fetters: The other loaded with bliſters can ſcarcely turn himſelf. The one enjoys freedom from pain, and has the perfect uſe of his ſenſes: The other complains he is racked all over, and is frequently delirious. The executioner does his office upon the one in a few minutes: But the phyſician and his medicines, make the other linger for days, before he can die out of his miſery. An honeſt ſheriff, and conſtables armed with ſtaves, wait upon one; while a greedy undertaker and his party, with like emblems of authority, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the other: And if it is any advantage to have a numerous attendance, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon the felon his the greater train.</p>
                           <p>When the pangs of death are over, does not the difference made between the corpſes conſiſt more in appearance than reality? The murderer is diſſected in the ſurgeon's hall gratis, and the rich ſinner is embowelled in his own apartment at great expence. The robber expoſed to open air, waſtes away in hoops of iron; and the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman confined to a damp vault, moulders away in ſheets of lead: And while the fowls of the air greedily prey upon the one, the vermin of the earth eagerly devour the other.</p>
                           <p>And if you conſider them as launching into the world of ſpirits; is not the advantage, in one reſpect, on the malefactor's ſide? He is ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:017930_0060_0FA37E5C7ADD7158"/>
aſſured he muſt die; and when the death-warrant comes down, all about him bid him prepare, and make the beſt of his ſhort time: But the phyſician and chaplain, friends and attendants, generally flatter the honourable ſinner to the laſt: And what is the conſequence? He either ſleeps on in carnal ſecurity, till death puts an end to all his deluſive dreams; or, if he has ſome notion that he muſt repent, for fear of diſcompoſing his ſpirits, he ſtill puts it off till <hi>to morrow</hi>; and in the midſt of his delays God ſays, <hi>Thou Fool,</hi> THIS NIGHT <hi>thy ſoul ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of thee.</hi> What wonder is it then, if when the converted thief goes from the ignominious tree to paradiſe, the impenitent rich man paſſes from <hi>his purple bed,</hi> into an awful eternity, and there <hi>lifts up his eyes in</hi> unexpected <hi>torments?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>If theſe are truths too obvious to be denied, wilt thou, Sinner, as the thoughtleſs vulgar, blunt their edge, by ſaying, with amazing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern, "Death is a debt we muſt all pay to nature?" Alas! This is granting the point; for if all have contracted ſo dreadful a debt, all are in a corrupt and loſt ſtate. Nor is this debt to be paid to <hi>Nature,</hi> but to <hi>Juſtice</hi>; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe dying would be as eaſy as ſleeping, or any other natural action: But it is beyond expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion terrible to thee, from whoſe ſoul the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer has not extracted <hi>ſin,</hi> the monſter's <hi>ſting:</hi> And if thou doſt not ſee it now in the moſt alarming light, it is becauſe either thou imagineſt it at a great diſtance; or the double veil of raſh preſumption, and brutiſh ſtupidity, is yet upon thy hardened heart.</p>
                           <p>Or wilt thou, as the poor Heathens, comfort thyſelf with the cruel thought, that "thou ſhalt not die alone?" Alas! dying companions may increaſe, but cannot take off the horror of deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.

Beſides, though we live in a crowd, we generally die alone: Each muſt drink that bitter cup, as if he were the only mortal in the univerſe.</p>
                           <p>What muſt we do then, in ſuch deplorable circumſtances? What! But humble ourſelves in the duſt, and bow low to the ſcepter of divine juſtice; confeſſing that ſince the righteous God has condemned us to certain death, and in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to a far more lingering and painful death, than murderers and traitors are made to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, we are certainly degenerate creatures and capital offenders, who ſtand in abſolute need of an Almighty Redeemer.</p>
                           <p>Permit me now, candid Reader, to make a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn appeal to thy reaſon aſſiſted by the fear of God. From all that has been advanced, does it not appear, that man is no more the favoured, happy, and innocent creature he was, when he came out of the hands of his infinitely gracious Creator? And is it not evident that, whether we conſider him as born into this diſordered world, or dying out of it, or paſſing from the womb to the grave, under a variety of calamitous circumſtances, God's providential dealings with him prove, that he is by nature in a corrupt and loſt eſtate?</p>

                     <p>WE have hitherto conſidered man as a miſerable inhabitant of a wretched world. We have ſeen him ſurrounded by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of wants; purſued by legions of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, maladies, and woes; arreſted by the king of terrors: caſt into the grave; and ſhut up there, the loathſome prey of corruption and worms. Let us now conſider him as a <hi>moral agent</hi>; and by examining his diſpoſition, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and conduct, let us ſee whether he is wiſely puniſhed, according to the ſentence of impartial juſtice; or wantonly tormented, at the caprice of arbitrary power.</p>
                     <p>We cannot help acknowledging, it is highly reaſonable, firſt, that all intelligent creatures ſhould love, reverence, and obey their Creator; becauſe he is moſt eminently their Father, their Maſter, and their King: Secondly, that they ſhould aſſiſt, ſupport, and love each other, as fellow-ſubjects, fellow-ſervants, and children of the ſame univerſal parent: And thirdly, that they ſhould preſerve their ſouls and bodies in peace and purity; by which means alone they can be happy in themſelves, profitable to man, and acceptable to God. This is what we ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally call <hi>natural religion,</hi> which is evidently founded upon eternal reaſon, the fitneſs of things, and the eſſential relation of perſons.</p>
                     <p>The propriety of theſe ſanctions is ſo ſelf-evident, that <hi>the Gentiles, who have not the</hi> written <hi>law, are a law unto themſelves, and do</hi> (but alas!
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:017930_0063_0FA37E5EB976F3E8"/>
how ſeldom, and from what motives!) <hi>the things contained in the law,</hi> thus <hi>ſhewing that the work,</hi> the ſum and ſubſtance <hi>of the law,</hi> though much blotted by the fall, <hi>is</hi> ſtill <hi>written in their heart.</hi> Nor will it be eraſed thence in hell itſelf; for nothing but a ſight of the equity of God's law, can clear his vindictive juſtice in the guilty breaſt, give a ſcorpion's ſting to the worm that gnaws the ſtubborn offender, and arm his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding conſcience with a whip of biting ſerpents.</p>
                     <p>Since the moral law ſo ſtrongly recommends itſelf to reaſon, let us ſee how univerſally it is obſerved or broken: So ſhall matter of fact de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, whether we are pure and upright, or pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted and depraved.</p>

                        <p>But <hi>one</hi> tranſgreſſion would be ſufficient to render them obnoxious to God's diſpleaſure, and to bring them under the fearful curſe of his broken law: For, even according to the ſtatutes of this realm, a man, who <hi>once</hi> robs a traveller of a ſmall ſum of money, forfeits his life; as well as the bloody highwayman, who for years barbarouſly murders all thoſe whom he ſtops, and accumulates immenſe wealth by his repeated barbarities.</p>

                        <p>What can be the reaſon of this amazing dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference? —What but rebellious ſenſe, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton appetite, raiſed at the ſight or idea of ſome forbidden object! The bait of pleaſure appears, corrupt nature ſummons all her powers, every nerve of expectation is ſtretched; every pulſe of deſire beats high; the blood is in a general fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the ſpirits are in an univerſal hurry; and though the hook of a fatal conſequence is often apparent, the alluring bait muſt be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. The fear of God, the moſt ineſtimable of all treaſures, is already gone; and if the ſinful gratification cannot be enjoyed upon any other term, a good reputation ſhall go alſo. Reaſon indeed makes remonſtrances; but the loud clamours of fleſh and blood, ſoon drown her ſoft whiſpers. The carnal mind ſteps im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periouſly upon the throne: Senſe, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers the greateſt conquerors, bear down all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: The yielding man is led captive by a brutiſh luſt; and while angels bluſh, there is joy in hell over the actual, and compleat degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of an heaven born ſpirit.</p>
                        <p>Some indeed affirm, that theſe conflicts ſuit a ſtate of probation and trial. But it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that either our temptations are too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent for our ſtrength, or our ſtrength too weak for our temptations; ſince, notwithſtanding the

                        <p>Nor can we exculpate ourſelves by pleading, that theſe triumphs of ſenſe over reaſon, are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther long nor frequent. Alas! How many perpetrate an act of wickedneſs in a moment, and ſuffer death itſelf for a crime which they never repeated!</p>
                        <p>See that chryſtal veſſel. Its brightneſs and brittleneſs repreſent the ſhining, and delicate nature of true virtue. If I let it fall, and break it, what avails it to ſay, "I never broke it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore —I dropped it but once—I am exceſſively ſorry for my careleſſneſs—I will ſet the pieces together, and never break it again:" Will theſe excuſes and reſolutions prevent the veſſel from being broken—broken for ever? The reader may eaſily make the application.</p>
                        <p>Even Heathen moraliſts, by their fabulous account of the companions of Ulyſſes, turned into ſwine, upon drinking <hi>once</hi> of Circe's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted cup, teach us, that <hi>one</hi> fall into ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, turns a man into a brute; juſt as one ſlip into unchaſtity or diſhoneſty, changes a modeſt woman into a ſtrumpet, or an honeſt man into a thief. Again,</p>
                        <p>Ought not reaſon to have as abſolute a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over appetite, as a ſkilful rider has over a well-broken horſe? But ſuppoſe we ſaw all horſemen univerſally maſtered, one time or other, by their beaſts; and forced, though but for a few minutes, to receive the bit, and go or ſtop at the pleaſure of the wanton brutes: ſhould we not wonder, and juſtly infer, that man had loſt the kind of ſuperiority, which he ſtill main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains over domeſtic animals?

                        <p>We may then conclude, that the univerſal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of our lower faculties againſt our ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior powers, and the triumphs of ſenſe over rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, demonſtrate, that human nature has ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered as fatal a revolution, as theſe kingdoms did, when a degraded king was ſeen bleeding on the ſcaffold, and a baſe uſurper lording it in the ſeat of majeſty.</p>

                        <p>And has our MEMORY eſcaped unimpaired by the fall? Alas! let us only conſider, how eaſily we forget the favours of our Creator, and recollect the injuries of our fellow-creatures; how little we retain of a good book, or pious diſcourſe, and how much of a play, or frivolous converſation: and how exactly we remember an invitation to a party of pleaſure, whilſt the loudeſt calls to turn to God, and prepare for death, are no ſooner heard than forgotten.—Let us, I ſay, conſider theſe things, and we ſhall be forced to confeſs, that this uſeful power loſes like a ſieve the living water of truth, drinks in like a ſpunge the muddy ſtreams of vanity, and is never ſo retentive, as when it is excited by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, or ſome other deteſtable temper.</p>

of doing it with all our might, we frequently remain as inactive, as if we were bound by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible chains; and we wonder by what charm the wheels of duty thus ſtop againſt our appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent inclination; till we diſcover, that the ſpring of our will is broken, or naturally works the wrong way. Yes, it is not only unable to follow the good, that the underſtanding ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves, but full of perverſeneſs to purſue the evil, that reaſon diſapproves: We are prone to do, contrary to our deſign, thoſe things which breed remorſe and wound conſcience; and ſooner or later, we may all ſay with the Heathen prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, who was going to murder her child,

                        <p>But as the heart-felt love of God is ſuppoſed to be downright enthuſiaſm by ſome moraliſts, who, daſhing in pieces the firſt table of the law againſt the ſecond, pretend that all our duty to God conſiſts in the love of our neighbour; let us examine the unconverted man's charity, and ſee whether he bears more love to his fellow-creatures than to his Creator.</p>
                        <p>Nothing can be more erroneous than his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>charity.</hi> He confounds it with the bare <hi>giving of alms</hi>; not conſidering that it is poſſible to do this kind of good, from the moſt ſelfiſh and <hi>uncharitable</hi> motives.

                        </p>
                        <p>Sometimes too he affixes to that word, the idea of a fond hope, that every body is going to heaven: For if you intimate, that the rich vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuary is not with Lazarus in Abraham's bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and that the fooliſh virgins are not promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly admitted to glory with the wiſe, he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at. "your uncharitableneſs," and thanks God "he never entertained ſuch unchriſtian thoughts of his neighbours."</p>
                        <p>He conſiders not, that <hi>charity</hi> is the fair off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of the <hi>love of God,</hi> to which he is yet an utter ſtranger; and that it conſiſts in an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, diſintereſted benevolence to all mankind, our worſt enemies not excepted: A benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that ſweetly evidences itſelf by bearing with patience the evil which they do to us, and kindly doing them all the good we poſſibly can, both with reſpect to their ſoul and body, their property and reputation.</p>
                        <p>If this is a juſt definition of charity, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renewed man has not even the outſide of it. To prove it, I might appeal to his impatience and ill-humour, his unkind words and cutting ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries (for I ſuppoſe him too moral ever to ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or curſe any one:) I might mention his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percilious behaviour to ſome, who are intitled to his affability as men, countrymen, and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: I might expatiate on his readineſs to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culpate, enrich, or aggrandize himſelf at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of <hi>others,</hi> whenever he can do it without expoſing <hi>himſelf.</hi>

                           <p n="3">III. The ſame objectors will probably reply,
<q>If corruption is univerſal, it cannot be ſaid to be equal; for numbers lead a very harmleſs, and not a few a very uſeful life.</q>

                           <p>To this I anſwer, that all have naturally <hi>an evil heart of unbelief,</hi> forgetful of, and <hi>departing from the living God.</hi> In this reſpect, <hi>there is no difference, all the world is guilty before God.</hi> But, thanks be to the Father of mercies, all do not remain ſo. Many cheriſh the ſeed of ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural grace, which we have from the Redeemer; they bow to his ſcepter, become <hi>new creatures, depart from iniquity, and are zealous of good works.</hi> And the ſame gracious power that has renewed them, is at work upon thouſands more; hourly reſtraining them from much evil, and daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing them to many uſeful actions.</p>
                           <p>With reſpect to the harmleſſneſs, for which ſome unrenewed perſons are remarkable, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpring from a better nature than that of their fellow mortals; for the nature of all <hi>men,</hi> like that of all <hi>wolves,</hi> is the ſame throughout the whole ſpecies. It muſt then be owing to the reſtraining grace of God, or to a happier con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, a ſtricter education, a deeper ſenſe of decency, or a greater regard for their character:
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:017930_0098_0FA37DCEBA6CF478"/>
perhaps only to the fear of conſequences, and to the want of natural boldneſs, or of a ſuitable temptation and fair opportunity to ſin. Nor are there few, who paſs for temperate, merely becauſe the diabolical pride lurking in their heart, ſcorns to ſtoop ſo low, as to indulge their beaſtly appetites: While others have the undeſerved reputation of good-natured, becauſe they find more delight in quietly gratifying their ſheepiſh indolence or brutal deſires, than in yielding to the uneaſy, boiſterous tempers, which they have in common with devils.</p>
                           <p>As to the virtues by which ſome of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted diſtinguiſh themſelves from others, they either ſpring from God's preventing grace, or are only vices in diſguiſe. The love of praiſe, the deſire of honour, and the thirſt of gold, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite thouſands to laudable deſigns, and uſeful actions. Wicked men, ſet on work by theſe powerful ſprings, do lying wonders in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral world, as the magycians did in the land of Egypt. They counterfeit divine grace, and for a time ſeem even to outdo believers themſelves. Hence it is, that we frequently ſee the indolent induſtrious, the coward brave, the covetous charitable, the phariſee religious, the Magdalen modeſt, and the daſtardly ſlave of his luſts a bold aſſerter of public liberty. But the ſearcher of hearts is not deceived by fair appearances: He judges of their actions according to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives whence they ſpring, and the ends for which they are performed: <hi>You are,</hi> ſays he to all theſe ſeemingly virtuous ſinners, <hi>like whited ſepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but within are full of dead mens' bones, and of all uncleanneſs.</hi>

Others of them, whoſe hypocriſy is not of ſo groſs a kind, are like perſons infected with a mortal diſeaſe, who, though the maſs of their blood is tainted, and ſome noble part attacked, ſtill walk about, do buſineſs, and look as freſh-coloured as if they were the picture of health. Ye ſons of Aeſculapius, who, without feeling their pulſe, and carefully weighing every ſymptom, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce them very well upon their look alone, do ye not blunder in phyſic, juſt as my object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors do in divinity?</p>

<q>It is wrong to father our ſinfulneſs upon a pretended natural depravity, when it may be entirely owing to the force of ill example, the influence of a bad education, or the ſtrong ferment of youthful blood.</q>

That theſe ſeeds lurk within the heart, before they are forced up by the heat of temptation, appears indubitable, if we conſider, 1. That all children, on particular occaſions, manifeſt ſome early inclination to thoſe ſins, which the feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their bodily organs, and the want of proper ferments in their blood, do not permit them to commit: 2. That infants betray envy, ill-humour, impatience, ſelfiſhneſs, anger, and

obſtinacy, even before they can take particular notice of ill examples, and underſtand bad counſels: And, 3. That though uncleanneſs, fornication, and adultery, on account of the ſhame and danger attending them, are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſo much ſecrecy, that the <hi>examples</hi> of them are ſeldom, if ever, given in public; they are nevertheleſs ſome of the crimes which are moſt univerſally or eagerly committed.</p>
                           <p>Beſides, if we were not more inclined to vice than virtue, good examples would be as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and have as much force, as bad ones. Therefore, the generality of bad examples can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ariſe but from the general ſinfulneſs of man; and to account for this general ſinfulneſs by the generality of bad examples, is <hi>begging</hi> the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and not <hi>proving</hi> the point.</p>
                           <p>Add to this, that as weeds, ſince the curſe, grow even in fields ſown with the beſt wheat; ſo vice, ſince the fall, grows in the midſt of the beſt examples, and the moſt excellent educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Witneſs the barbarous crimes committed by pious Jacob's children, and penitent Adam's eldeſt ſon.</p>

<q>But if Cain ſinned, ſay our objectors, and all mankind ſin alſo, it is no more than Adam himſelf once did by his own free choice, though he was created as exempt from original depravity as an angel.

                           <p>To this I reply, It is not one accident or ſingle event, but a continual repetition of the ſame event, that proves a proneneſs. If a man, who is perfectly in his ſenſes, by ſome unfore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen

The ſtrong fumes have already reached their heads; and while ſome ſtagger home, others triumphantly keep the field of exceſs; though one is already ſtamped with the heavineſs of the ox, another worked up to the fierceneſs and roar of the lion, and a third brought down to the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs of the vomiting dog.</p>

Silver ſpurs, or ſteel talons, ſharper than thoſe of the eagle, are barbarouſly faſtened to their feet: Thus armed, they are excited to leap at each other, and in an hundred repeated onſets to tear their feathers and fleſh, as if they were contending vultures; and if at laſt one blinded, covered with blood and wounds, and unable to ſtand any longer the metallic claws of his antagoniſt, enters into the agonies of death; the numerous ring of ſtamping, clapping, ſhout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, eagerly betting, or horridly curſing ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, is as highly delighted, as if the tortured, dying creature, was the common enemy of mankind.</p>
                        <p>In another place, a multitude of ſpectators is delightfully entertained by two brawny men, who unmercifully knock one another down, as if they were oxen appointed for the ſlaughter,

and continue the ſavage play, till one, with his fleſh bruiſed and his bones ſhattered, bleeding, and gaſping as in the pangs of death, yields to his antagoniſt, and thus puts an end to the ſhocking ſport.</p>
                        <p>But it is perhaps a different ſpectacle, that recommends itſelf to the bloody taſte of our bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Heathens. Fierce dogs are excited by fiercer men, with fury to faſten upon the noſe, or tear out the eyes, of a poor confined animal, which pierces the ſky with his painful and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable bellowings, enough to force compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the heart of barbarians, not totally loſt to all ſenſe of humanity; whilſt in the mean time the ſurrounding, ſavage mob, rends the very heavens with the moſt horrid imprecations, and repeated ſhouts of applauding joy; ſporting themſelves with that very miſery, which human nature (were it not deplorably corrupted) would teach them to alleviate. <note n="†" place="bottom">

By this ſtrange procedure they want, at beſt, to decide whether a tract of land, to which none of them all lays any claim, ſhall belong to a certain man whom they call Sultan, or to another whom they name Caeſar, neither of whom ever ſaw, or will ſee, the ſpot ſo furiouſly contended for: And very few of thoſe creatures who thus mutually butcher one another, ever beheld the animal for whom they cut each others throats. From time immemorial this has been the way of mankind almoſt over all the earth. What an exceſs of madneſs is this!

<q>Famine, peſtilence, and war, are the three moſt famous ingredients of this lower world. The two firſt come from God; but the laſt, in which all three concur, comes from the imagination of princes or miniſters. A king fancies, that he has a right to a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant province. He raiſes a multitude of men, who have nothing to do, and nothing to loſe; gives them a red coat and a laced hat, and makes them wheel to the right, wheel to the left, and march to glory. Five or ſix of theſe belligerent powers ſometimes engage together, three againſt three, or two againſt four: But whatever part they take, they all agree in one point, which is, to do their neighbour all poſſible miſchief. The moſt aſtoniſhing thing, belonging to their infernal undertaking, is, that every ring-leader of thoſe murderers, gets his colours conſecrated,
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:017930_0110_0FA37DD7B97142E0"/>
and ſolemnly bleſſed in the name of God, before he marches up to the deſtruction of his fellow creatures. If a chief warrior has had the good fortune of getting only two or three thouſand men ſlaughtered, he does not think it worth his while to thank God for it: But if ten thouſand have been deſtroyed by fire and ſword, and if (to compleat his good fortune) ſome capital city has been totally overthrown, a day of public thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving is appointed on the joyful occaſion. Is not that a fine art which carries ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation through the earth; and, one year with another deſtroys forty thouſand men, out of an hundred thouſand!</q>

                        <p>But let us look around us at home: When perſecuting Popery had almoſt expired in the fires, in which it burned our firſt church-men, how ſoon did thoſe who ſurvived them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence perſecutors of the Preſbyterians?

                        <p>When evidences of the moſt oppoſite intereſt, agree in their depoſition of a matter of fact, its truth is greatly corroborated.

                        <p>When the Heathens made their temples ſtream with the blood of ſlaughtered hecatombs, did they not often explicitly deprecate the wrath of heaven and impending deſtruction?

<q>Who can, without horror, conſider the whole earth as the empire of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction! It abounds in wonders; it abounds alſo in victims; it is a vaſt field of carnage and contagion. Every ſpecies is, without pity, purſued and torn to pieces, through the earth, and air, and water. In man there is <hi>more</hi> wretchedneſs, than in <hi>all</hi> other animals put together: He ſmarts continually under two ſcourges, which other animals never feel; anxiety, and a liſtleſſneſs in appearance, which make him weary of himſelf. He loves life, and yet he knows that he muſt die. If he enjoys ſome tranſient good, for which he is thankful to heaven, he ſuffers various evils, and is at laſt devoured by worms. This knowledge is his fatal prerogative: Other animals have it not. He feels it every moment, rankling and corroding in his breaſt. Yet he ſpends the tranſient moment of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, in diffuſing the miſery that he ſuffers; in cutting the throats of his fellow-creatures for pay; in cheating and being cheated; in robbing and being robbed; in ſerving that he may command; and in repenting of all that he does. The bulk of mankind are nothing more than a crowd of wretches, equally cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal and unfortunate, and the globe contains rather carcaſſes than men. I tremble, upon a review of this dreadful picture, to find that it implies a complaint againſt providence, and I wiſh that I had never been born.</q>
[<hi>Voltaire's Goſpel of the Day.</hi>] <note n="*" place="bottom">
                              <p>Wild error is often the guide, and glaring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction the badge, both of thoſe, who reject re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, like Voltaire; and of thoſe, who indirectly ſet aſide one half of it, like the Phariſees and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians around us. See a ſtriking proof of it. This very author, in another book, (O! ſee what <hi>anti-chriſtian</hi> morality comes to!) repreſents the horrible ſin of Sodom as an <hi>excuſable miſtake of nature,</hi> and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us, that
<q>At the worſt of times, there is at moſt upon earth, one man in a thouſand, that can be called wicked.</q>
Now for the proof!
<q>Hardly do we ſee one of thoſe enormous crimes, that ſhock human nature, committed in ten years at Rome, Paris, or London, thoſe cities where the thirſt of gain, which is the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of all crimes, is carried to the higheſt pitch—If men were eſſentially wicked, we ſhould find every morning huſbands murdered by their wives, &amp;c. as we do hens killed by foxes.</q>
According to this apoſtle of the deiſtical world, it ſeems, that the moſt intenſe thirſt of gold is no degree of wickedneſs; that a woman, to be very good, needs only not cut her huſband's throat while he is aſleep; and that it even little matters whether ſhe omits the dire murder out of regard to <hi>his</hi> life, or <hi>her own.</hi> What moral philoſophy is here! Why, if the ſin of Sodom is a peccadillo, a frolickſome miſtake; and nothing is wickedneſs but a treacherous cutting of an huſband's or a parent's throat; I extend my charity four times beyond thee, O Voltaire, and do maintain, that there is not one wicked man in <hi>five thouſand.</hi>

nakedneſs, ſtocks and priſons, racks and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; which indeed was all that they could, or did expect, in conſequence of Chriſt's expreſs declarations. Neither was a deſire of honour the motive of their actions; for their Lord himſelf was treated with the utmoſt contempt, and had more than once aſſured them, that they ſhould certainly ſhare the ſame fate: Beſides, they were humble men, not above working as mechanics for a coarſe maintenance, and ſo little deſirous of human regard, that they expoſed to the world the meanneſs of their birth and occupations, their great ignorance and ſcandalous falls.</p>
                     <p>Add to this, that they were ſo many, and lived at ſuch diſtance of time and place from each other, that had they been impoſtors, it would have been impracticable for them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive and carry on a forgery, without being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected. And as they neither would nor could <hi>deceive</hi> the world; ſo they neither could nor would <hi>be deceived</hi> themſelves: For they were days, months, and years, <hi>eye</hi> and <hi>ear</hi> witneſſes of the things which they relate; and when they had not the fulleſt evidence of important facts, they inſiſted upon new proofs, and even upon ſenſible demonſtrations; as for inſtance, Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, in the matter of our Lord's reſurrection, <hi>John</hi> xx. 25. And to leave us no room to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion their ſincerity, moſt of them joyfully ſealed the truth of their doctrines with their own blood.

In this reſpect the caſe of the primitive Chriſtians widely differed from that of Mahomet's followers: For thoſe who adhered to the warlike, violent impoſtor, ſaved their lives and properties, or attained to honour, by their new, eaſy, and fleſh-pleaſing religion: But thoſe, who devoted themſelves to the meek, ſelf-denying, crucified Jeſus, were frequently ſpoiled of their goods, and cruelly put to death; or if they eſcaped with their lives, were looked upon as the very dregs of mankind.</p>

Nay, is it not as abſurd to aſſert it, as it would be to affirm, that the offices for the 5th of November, and the 30th of January, were forged by crafty prieſts; and that the Papiſts, Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, and Royaliſts of the laſt century, agreed to impoſe upon the world the hiſtory of the gun-powder plot, and of king Charles's decollation, with which thoſe parts of our liturgy are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably connected?</p>

Moſes, who leads the van of their ſacred au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, ſums up his hiſtory of the Iſraelites, and draws up their character in theſe diſgraceful words, which he ſpake to their face: <hi>You have been rebellious againſt the Lord from the day that I knew you,</hi> Deut. ix. 24.

is wholly founded upon the vulgar no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we have our ſouls immediately from God by infuſion: It will therefore entirely fall to the ground, if we can prove, that we receive them, as well as our bodies, by traduction from Adam: And that this is fact, appears, if I am not miſtaken, by the following arguments,</p>
                           <p n="1">

On the contrary, it is ſaid, that <hi>God reſted on the ſeventh day from</hi> ALL <hi>his work</hi> of creation.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Eve herſelf was not <hi>created</hi> but <hi>in</hi> Adam: God breathed no breath of life into her, as he did into her huſband, to make him <hi>a living ſoul.</hi> Therefore when Adam ſaw her, he ſaid, <hi>She ſhall be called woman, becauſe ſhe</hi> [her whole ſelf, not her body only] <hi>was taken out of man.</hi> If then the ſoul of the firſt woman ſprang from Adam's ſoul, as her body from his body, what reaſon have we to believe, that the ſouls of her poſterity are immediately infuſed, as Adam's was when God created him?</p>
                           <p n="3">3. All agree, that under God we receive <hi>life</hi> from our parents; and if <hi>life,</hi> then certainly our <hi>ſoul,</hi> which is the <hi>principle of life.</hi>

                           <p>'But upon this ſcheme,' will objectors ſay,
<q>if Adam was converted when he begat a ſon, he begat a converted ſoul.</q>
This does by no means follow; for if he was born of God after his fall, it was <hi>by grace through faith,</hi> and not by nature through generation: He could not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore communicate his <hi>ſpiritual regeneration</hi> by <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural generation,</hi> any more than a great ſcholar can propagate his learning together with his ſpecies.</p>

                           <p>Should ſome perſons reject what I ſay of the traduction of ſouls, in order to illuſtrate the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation of original ſin: and ſhould they ſay, that they have no more idea of the <hi>generation,</hi> than honeſt Nicodemus had of the <hi>regeneration of a ſpirit:</hi> I beg leave to obſerve two things,</p>

                           <p>Secondly, Should my objectors be verſed in natural philoſophy, they need not be told, that even the kind of generation, which they allow, is as much a <hi>myſtery</hi> to man, as the movement of a watch is to a child, that juſt ſees the caſe and the glaſs.

Matter of fact daily proves, that we readily admit the evidence of men, while we pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily reject the teſtimony of God. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore Biron's extraordinary account of the giants in Patagonia is or was every where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: But that of Jeſus Chriſt, concerning thoſe who <hi>walk in the broad way to deſtruction,</hi> is and has always been too generally diſregarded, Matt. vii. 13.</p>
                        <p>On reading in a news-paper an anonymous letter from Naples, we believe, that rivers of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid fire flow from the convulſed bowels of a mountain, and form burning lakes in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent plains: But if we read in the ſcripture, that <hi>Tophet,</hi> the burning lake, <hi>is prepared of old</hi> for the impenitent, we beg leave to with-hold our aſſent; and unleſs divine grace prevents, we muſt fall in, and feel, before we will aſſent and believe, Iſa. xxx. 33.</p>
                        <p>Who, that has ſeen a map of Africa, ever doubted whether there is ſuch a kingdom as that of Morocco, though he never ſaw it, or any of its natives?

Though Chriſt himſelf invites us to it, and many pious perſons not only teſtify they enjoy it, but actually ſhew its bleſſed fruits in heavenly tempers, a blameleſs life, a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant death.

                        <p>And ye, numerous tribe of patients, how do ye ſhame thoſe who call themſelves Chriſtians! So entire is the truſt which you repoſe upon a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician's advice, whom perhaps you have ſeen but once, that you immediately abſtain from your pleaſant food, and regularly take medicines, which, for what you know, may be as injurious to your ſtomach, as they are offenſive to your palate: But we, who profeſs Chriſtianity, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally quarrel with Chriſt's preſcriptions; and if we do not underſtand the nature of a remedy which he recommends, we think this is a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient reaſon for refuſing it.

                        <p>One falſe witneſs is often ſufficient to make us believe, that a neighbour vows to do us an injury: But twenty miniſters of Jeſus cannot perſuade us, God <hi>hath ſworn in his wrath,</hi> that if we die in our ſins <hi>we ſhall not enter into his reſt,</hi> Pſal. xcv. 11. or that if we <hi>come to him</hi> for pardon and life, <hi>he will in no wiſe caſt us out,</hi> John vi. 37.—The moſt defamatory and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable reports ſpread with uncommon ſwiftneſs, and paſs for matter of fact: But when St. Paul teſtifies, that <hi>if any man hath not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his,</hi> Rom. viii. 9. who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves his teſtimony?

                        <p>Iſaiah aſks, <hi>Who hath believed our report?</hi> And Jeſus ſays, <hi>When the Son of man cometh, ſhall he find faith upon the earth?</hi> Alas! there would have been no room for theſe plaintive queſtions, if <hi>the word of God</hi> had not been propoſed to our faith; for the moſt groundleſs and abſurd aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men, find multitudes of believers.

                        <p>It is evident that man has a fooliſh and <hi>evil heart of unbelief,</hi> ready to <hi>ſtrain out a gnat</hi> in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine revelation, while he greedily <hi>ſwallows up the camel</hi> of human impoſture.

If we are not <hi>by nature conceived in ſin,</hi> and <hi>children of wrath,</hi> millions of infants, who die without actual ſin, have no need of the blood of Chriſt to waſh their robes, nor his Spirit to purify their hearts.

                        <p>Nor does it appear, why it might not be as abſurd with regard to the reſt of mankind, did they but act their part a little better: For if we are naturally innocent, we have a natural power to remain ſo; and by a proper uſe of it, we may avoid ſtanding in need of the ſalvation procured by Chriſt for the <hi>loſt.</hi>

                        <p>Nay, if innocent nature, carefully improved, may be the way to eternal life, it is certainly the readieſt way, and the Son of God ſpeaks like the grand deceiver of mankind, when he ſays, <hi>I am the way,</hi> NO MAN <hi>cometh to the Father</hi> but BY ME.

                        </p>
                        <p>Take away then the doctrine of the fall, and the tower of evangelical truth, built by Jeſus Chriſt, is no more founded on a rock, but upon the ſand: Or rather, the ſtately fabric is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly thrown down, and leaves no ruins behind it, but the dry morality of Epictetus, covered with the rubbiſh of the vileſt metaphors, and buried in the moſt impertinent ceremonies.</p>

                        <p>Leaving therefore that trite objection to the unthinking vulgar, once more, judicious reader, ſummon all your rational powers; and, after imploring help from on high to uſe them aright, ſay, whether theſe laſt arguments do not prove, that no <hi>Chriſtian</hi> can deny the compleat fall of mankind, without renouncing the capital doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of his own religion; overturning the very foundation of the goſpel, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes to receive; ſtaining the glory of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, whom he pretends to honour; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly taking from his crown, <hi>wiſdom, truth,</hi> and <hi>charity,</hi> the three jewels that are its brighteſt ornaments.—Sum up then all that has been advanced concerning the afflictive dealings of

God's providence with mankind, and the baſe conduct, or wicked temper of mankind towards God, one another, and themſelves.—Declare, if all the arguments laid before you, and cleared from the thickeſt clouds of objections that might obſcure them, do not caſt more light upon the black ſubject of our depravity, than is ſufficient to ſhew that it is a melancholy truth. —And finally pronounce, whether the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of our corrupt and loſt eſtate, ſtated in the words of the ſacred writers, and of our pious reformers, is not <hi>rationally demonſtrated,</hi> and eſtabliſhed upon the firmeſt baſis in the world, <hi>Matter of Fact, and</hi> the dictates of <hi>common ſenſe.</hi>

                     <p>WHEN a doctrine has been clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, the truths that <hi>neceſſarily</hi> ſpring from it, cannot reaſonably be rejected. Let then common ſenſe decide, whether the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing conſequences do not <hi>neceſſarily</hi> reſult from the doctrine of the fall, eſtabliſhed in the preceding parts of this treatiſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. INFERENCE. If we are by nature in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and loſt eſtate, the grand buſineſs of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters is to rouze our drowzy conſciences, and warn us of our imminent danger: It behoves them to <hi>cry aloud and ſpare not, to lift up their voice like a trumpet,</hi> and <hi>ſhew us our tranſgreſſions and our ſins.</hi> Nor are they to deſiſt from this unpleaſing part of their office, till we <hi>awake to righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>lay hold on the hope ſet before us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If preachers, under pretence of peace and good-nature, let the wound feſter in the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their hearers, to avoid the thankleſs of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of probing it to the bottom: If, for fear of giving them pain by a timely amputation, they let them die of a mortification: Or if <hi>they heal the hurt of the daughter of God's people ſlightly, ſaying, Peace! Peace! when there is no peace</hi>; they imitate thoſe ſycophants of old, who, for fear of diſpleaſing the rich, and offending the great, <hi>preached ſmooth things, and propheſied deceit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This cruel gentleneſs, this ſoft barbarity, is attended with the moſt pernicious conſequences,
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:017930_0175_0FA37E0879E99F60"/>
and will deſervedly meet with the moſt dreadful puniſhment. <hi>Give ſinners warning from me,</hi> ſays the Lord to every miniſter: <hi>When I ſay to the wicked,</hi> the unconverted, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſurely die; and thou giveſt him not warning, he ſhall die in his iniquity,</hi> in his unconverted ſtate; <hi>but his blood will I require at</hi> THY <hi>hand.</hi> See Matt. xviii. 3. Ezek. iii. 18. and xiii. 10.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. INFER. If we are naturally depraved and condemned creatures; <hi>ſelf-righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>pride</hi> are the moſt abſurd and monſtrous of all our ſins. The deepeſt repentance and profoundeſt humility become us: To <hi>neglect</hi> them, is to ſtumble at the very threſhold of true religion; and to <hi>ridicule</hi> them, is to pour contempt upon reaſon, revelation, and the firſt operations of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace on a ſinner's heart.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. INFER. If the corruption of mankind is univerſal, inveterate, and amazingly powerful, no mere creature can deliver them from it. They muſt remain unreſtored; or they muſt have an almighty, omniſcient, omnipreſent, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied, infinitely patient Saviour; willing day and night to attend to the wants, and public or ſecret applications of millions of wretched ſouls; and able to give them immediate aſſiſtance throughout the world; in all their various trials, temptations, and conflicts, both in life and in death. Is the moſt exalted <hi>creature</hi> ſufficient for theſe things?</p>
                     <p>When ſuch a vaſt body as mankind, ſpread over all the earth for thouſands of years, made up of numerous nations, all of which conſiſt of multitudes of individuals, each of whom has the ſprings of all his faculties and powers enfeebled, diſordered, or broken:—When ſuch an immenſe
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:017930_0176_0FA37E093901A0C0"/>
body as this, is to be reſtored to the image of the infinitely holy, glorious, and bleſſed God; common ſenſe dictates, that the amazing taſk can be performed by no other than the original Artiſt, the great Searcher of hearts, the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Creator of mankind.</p>
                     <p>Hence it appears, that, notwithſtanding the cavils of Arius, the Saviour is GOD OVER ALL <hi>bleſſed for ever, all things were made by him, he upholds all things by the word of his power,</hi> and every believer may adore him, and ſay, with the wondering apoſtle, when the light of faith ſhone into his benighted ſoul, <hi>My Lord and my</hi> God!</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. INFER. If our guilt is immenſe, it cannot be expiated without a ſacrifice of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite dignity: Hence we diſcover the miſtake of Heathens and carnal Jews, who truſted in the ſacrifices of beaſts; the error of Deiſts, Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans, and Socinians, who ſee no need of any expiatory ſacrifice; and the amazing preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of too many Chriſtians, who repoſe a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of their confidence in the proper merit of their works; inſtead of placing it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely in the infinitely meritorious ſacrifice of the immaculate Lamb of God, humbly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that all the gracious rewardableneſs of the beſt works of faith, is derived from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood and <hi>original</hi> merit.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. INFER. If our ſpiritual maladies are both numerous and mortal, it is evident, we cannot <hi>recover</hi> the ſpiritual health that we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed in our firſt parents, but by the powerful help of our heavenly Phyſician, the ſecond Adam. How abſurd is it then to ſay, that we
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:017930_0177_0FA37E09F9263408"/>
are ſaved, or <hi>recovered,</hi> by doing good works, without the quickning grace of a Saviour!</p>
                     <p>A wretched beggar is lame both in his hands and feet: An officious man, inſtead of taking him to a perſon famous for his ſkill in relieving ſuch objects of diſtreſs, aſſures him, that the only way of getting well, is to run of errands for his prince, and work for his fellow-beggars. You juſtly wonder at the cruelty and folly of ſuch a director: But you have much more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be aſtoniſhed at the conduct of thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable empirics, who direct poor, blind, lame ſinners, labouring under a complication of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual diſorders, and ſick even unto eternal death, to ſave themſelves merely by ſerving God, and doing good to their neighbours; as if they needed neither repentance towards God, nor faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, nor yet free grace to enable them to repent, believe, and ſerve God acceptably.</p>
                     <p>How much more rational is the evangelical method of ſalvation! <hi>We are ſaved,</hi> ſays the apoſtle, we are reſtored to <hi>ſaving health,</hi> and a ſpiritual activity to ſerve God and our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, <hi>not by works, not of ourſelves</hi>; but <hi>by grace,</hi> by mere favour; <hi>through faith,</hi> through ſuch an entire confidence in our Phyſician, as makes us gladly take his powerful remedies, abſtain from the pleaſing poiſon of ſin, and feed on thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truths, which communicate angelical vigor and happineſs to our ſouls. Eph. ii. 8.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. INFER. If our nature is ſo compleatly fallen and totally helpleſs, that in ſpiritual things <hi>we are not ſufficient of ourſelves to think any thing</hi> truly good <hi>as of ourſelves, but our ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency is of God</hi>; it is plain, we ſtand in abſolute

need of his Spirit's aſſiſtance, to enable us to pray, repent, believe, love, and obey aright. Conſequently, thoſe who ridicule the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and his ſacred influence, deſpiſe the great <hi>helper of our infirmities,</hi> and act a moſt irrational, wicked, and deſperate part. Rom. viii. 26.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. INFER. If by nature we are <hi>really</hi> and <hi>truly</hi> born in ſin, our regeneration cannot be a mere metaphor, or a vain ceremony; our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual birth muſt be <hi>real</hi> and <hi>poſitive.</hi> How fatal therefore is the miſtake of thoſe, who ſuppoſe that the <hi>new birth</hi> is only a figurative expreſſion for a <hi>decent behaviour!</hi> How dreadful the error of thoſe, who imagine that all, whoſe faces have been typically waſhed with material water in baptiſm, are now effectually <hi>born again of</hi> living <hi>water and the</hi> Holy <hi>Spirit!</hi> And how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable the caſe of the multitudes, who, in the church of England, are under this danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous miſtake, ſo prudently guarded againſt by our pious reformers!</p>
                     <p>In our catechiſm, they clearly diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>the outward viſible ſign or form in baptiſm,</hi> and <hi>the inward ſpiritual grace:</hi> And by defining the latter, <hi>a death unto ſin, and a new birth unto righteouſneſs,</hi> they declare that whoſoever is not <hi>dead</hi> or dying <hi>to ſin</hi> and <hi>alive to righteouſneſs,</hi> is not truly regenerate, and has nothing of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm but the <hi>outward and viſible ſign.</hi> In the 27th of our articles they mention, that <hi>baptiſm is</hi> not the new birth, but <hi>a</hi> SIGN <hi>of regeneration or new birth, whereby, as by an inſtrument, they who receive baptiſm rightly, are grafted into the church.</hi> And if our church returns thanks for the regeneration of the infants whom ſhe has
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:017930_0179_0FA37E0B7A11A190"/>
admitted to baptiſm, it is chiefly <note n="*" place="bottom">I ſay <hi>chiefly,</hi> becauſe our church gives thanks alſo for Chriſt's general grace and mercy to children, declaring herſelf <hi>perſuaded of the good-will of our heavenly Father towards this</hi> [unbaptized] <hi>infant,</hi> through Chriſt, who ſaid, that <hi>of little children is the kingdom of heaven.</hi> The truth lies between the error of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> who ſuppoſe that unbaptized infants are <hi>ſinleſs</hi> like angels; and that of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who affirm that they are <hi>graceleſs</hi> as devils.</note> upon a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable ſuppoſition, that they have <hi>received it rightly,</hi> and will, <hi>for their part, faithfully perform the promiſes made for them by their ſureties.</hi> If they refuſe to do it <hi>when they come of age,</hi> far from treating them as her regenerate children, ſhe denounces a general excommunication againſt them, and charges them <hi>not to come to</hi> her <hi>holy table, leſt Satan brings them, as</hi> he did <hi>Judas, to deſtruction both of body and ſoul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. INFER. If the fall of mankind in Adam, does not conſiſt in a capricious imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his perſonal guilt, but in a real, preſent participation of his depravity, impotence, and miſery; the ſalvation that believers have in Chriſt, is not a capricious imputation of his perſonal righteouſneſs; but a real, preſent par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of his purity, power, and bleſſedneſs, together with pardon and acceptance.</p>
                     <p>Unſpeakably dangerous then is the deluſion of thoſe, whoſe brains and mouths are filled with the notions and expreſſions of <hi>imputed righteouſneſs</hi>; while their poor, carnal, unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate hearts remain perfect ſtrangers to <hi>the Lord our righteouſneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">
                        <pb n="183" facs="unknown:017930_0180_0FA37E0C4120B628"/>IX. INFER. If the corrupt nature which ſinners derive from Adam, ſpontaneouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces all the wickedneſs that overſpreads the earth; the holy nature which believers receive from Chriſt, is alſo ſpontaneouſly productive of all the fruits of righteouſneſs, deſcribed in the oracles of God: <hi>Good works ſpringing out</hi> 
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">This is to be underſtood of a moral, and not of an abſolute, irreſiſtible neceſſity; for faith never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans the believer.</note> NE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CESSARILY <hi>of a true and lively faith,</hi> Art. xii.</p>
                     <p>Such miniſters therefore, as clearly preach our fall in Adam, and that faith in Chriſt which is productive of genuine holineſs and active love, will infallibly promote good works and pure morality: When thoſe who inſiſt <hi>only</hi> upon works and moral duties, will neither be zealous of good works themſelves, nor inſtrumental in turning ſinners from their groſs immoralities. The reaſon is obvious: Evangelical preachers follow their Lord's wiſe directions: <hi>Make the tree good, and the fruit ſhall be good alſo</hi>; but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts will have <hi>corrupt trees bring forth good fruit,</hi> which in the nature of things is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, Matt. xii. 33. Luke vi. 43. Therefore, as nothing but faith <hi>makes the tree good,</hi> and as <hi>without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God</hi>; the Chriſtian, that will <hi>come to him</hi> with good works, <hi>muſt</hi> not only <hi>believe</hi> [as Heathens] <hi>that he is, and that he is a rewarder of thoſe who diligently ſeek him</hi>; but alſo that <hi>he was in Chriſt, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling the world unto himſelf,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="10">X. INFER. If corruption and ſin work ſo powerfully and ſenſibly, in the hearts of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate, we may, without deſerving the name of Enthuſiaſts, affirm, that the regenerate are
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:017930_0181_0FA37E0CF9E44060"/>
ſenſible of the powerful effects of divine grace in their ſouls; or, to uſe the words of our 17th article, we may ſay, <hi>They feel in themſelves the workings of the Spirit of Chriſt:</hi> For <hi>where</hi> the poiſon of <hi>ſin hath abounded,</hi> and has been of courſe abundantly felt; <hi>grace,</hi> the powerful an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote that expels it, does <hi>much more abound,</hi> and conſequently may be much more perceived.</p>
                     <p>Therefore <hi>the knowledge of ſalvation by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins,</hi> the aſſurance of faith, and <hi>the peace of God paſſing all underſtanding,</hi> are the EX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PERIENCED <hi>bleſſings</hi> of the converted; as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly as a guilty conſcience, the gnawing of worldly cares, the working of evil tempers, the tumults of unbridled appetites, and the uproars of rebellious paſſions, are the EXPERIENCED <hi>curſes</hi> of the unconverted.</p>
                     <p>Reader! If theſe inferences are juſtly drawn, is it not evident, that the <note n="*" place="bottom">Thoſe doctrines, pointed out in the ten above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned inferences, are—1.

Salvation by faith in him. 6. The influences of his Holy Spirit. 7. The reality of the new birth. 8. The neceſſity of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſalvation. 9. The zeal of believers for good works, and 10. The comfortable aſſurance which they have of their regeneration.</note> principles generally exploded among us, as enthuſiaſtical or method<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical, flow from the doctrine demonſtrated in this treatiſe, as naturally as light from the ſun? Theſe conſequences lead you perhaps farther than you could wiſh; but let them not make you either afraid or aſhamed of the goſpel. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, like clouds, will vaniſh away; but truth, which they obſcure for a time, like the ſun,
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:017930_0182_0FA37E0DBAE4ACE8"/>
will ſhine for ever. A great man in the law ſaid, <hi>Fiat Juſtitia, ruat mundus.</hi> Improve the noble ſentiment, and ſay with equal fortitude, <hi>Stet Veritas, ruat mundus:</hi> Let truth ſtand, tho' the univerſe ſhould ſink into ruins.</p>
                     <p>But happily for us, the danger is all on the ſide of the oppoſite doctrine; and that you may be convinced of it, I preſent you next with a view of the
<q>

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. As the tempter cauſed the fall of our firſt parents, by inducing them to believe, that they <hi>ſhould not ſurely die,</hi> if they broke the divine law: So, now we are fallen, he prevents our recovery by ſuggeſting, 'the bitterneſs of death is paſt,' and 'we are in a ſtate of ſafety.'—Hence it is, that you ſleep on in carnal ſecurity, O ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded ſons of men, and even dream, ye are ſafe and righteous. Nor can ye eſcape for your lives, till the veil of unbelief is taken away, and ye awake to a ſight of your corrupt and loſt eſtate: For there is no guarding againſt, nor flying from, an unſeen, unſuſpected evil: Here, as in a conſpiracy, the danger continually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes, till it is happily diſcovered.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If we are not ſenſible of our natural cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and the juſtice of the curſe intailed upon us on that account; can we help thinking God a tyrant, when he threatens unconverted moraliſts with the ſevereſt of his judgments, or

cauſe the black ſtorms of his providence to overtake us and our deareſt relatives?</p>
                     <p>Anſwer, ye ſelf-righteous Phariſees, that ſo bitterly exclaim againſt the miniſters, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare by the authority of ſcripture, that, <hi>except ye repent, ye ſhall all periſh.</hi> Anſwer, fond mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whoſe tears of diſtraction mix with the cold ſweat of the convulſed, dying infant on thy lap. Doſt thou not ſecretly impeach divine juſtice, and accuſe heaven of barbarity? Ah! if thou didſt but know the evil nature, which thou and thy Iſaac have brought into the world; if thou ſaw'ſt the root of bitterneſs, which the hand of a gracious providence even now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts from his heart; far from being ready to <hi>curſe God, and die</hi> with thy child, thou wouldſt patiently acquieſce in the kindly ſevere diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation: Thou wouldſt <hi>clear him when he is judged</hi> by ſuch as thyſelf, and even <hi>glorify him in the evil day of</hi> this painful <hi>viſitation.</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. Though man's heart is hardened as ſteel, it does not frequently emit the helliſh ſparks of ſuch murmurings againſt God, becauſe it can ſeldom be ſtruck by the flint of ſuch ſevere af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions; yet the miſchief is there, and will break out, if not by <hi>blaſphemous deſpair,</hi> at leaſt its contrary, <hi>preſumptuous madneſs.</hi> Yes, reader, unleſs thou art happily made acquainted with the ſtrength of thy inbred depravity, thou wilt raſhly venture among the ſparks of temptation: With carnal confidence thou wilt aſk,
<q>What harm can they do me?</q>
And thou wilt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the hazardous ſport, till ſin and wrath conſume thee together. Nor will this be more ſurprizing, than that one, who carries a bag of gun-powder, and knows not the dangerous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his load, ſhould fearleſsly ruſh through

                     <p n="4">4. This fatal raſhneſs is generally accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a glaring inconſiſtency. Do not you make the aſſertion good, ye ſaints of the preſent age, who pretend to have found the ſecret of loving both God and the world? Do not we hear you deny to men, that you are <hi>condemned</hi>; and yet cry to God to <hi>have mercy upon you?</hi> But if you are not condemned, what need have you of <hi>mercy?</hi> And if you are, why do you deny your loſt eſtate?

Ignorance of the myſtery of iniquity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you, muſt, in the nature of the things, cauſe you to neglect prayer, or to pray out of charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. As unhumbled moraliſts, inſtead of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching the throne of grace, with the ſelf-abaſement of the penitent Publican, ſaying, <hi>God be merciful unto me a ſinner:</hi> you will provoke the Moſt High, by the open profaneneſs of the Sadducee; or inſult him by the ſelf-conceited ſervices of the Phariſee, boaſting ye
<q>do no harm,</q>
and <hi>thanking God,</hi> ye <hi>are not as other men.</hi> On theſe rocks your formal devotion will ſplit, till you know, that, as the impenitent and prayerleſs ſhall periſh, ſo the Lord accepts no penitential prayer, but that of <hi>the man, who knows the plague of his own heart</hi>; becauſe he alone prays in his own character, and without hypocriſy, 1 Pet. v. 5. 1 Kings viii. 38.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. And as you cannot approach the throne of grace aright, while you remain inſenſible of your corruption; ſo the reading or preaching of God's word, till it anſwers the end of convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

is of no ſervice to you, but rather proves, to uſe St. Paul's nervous expreſſion, the <hi>ſavour of death unto death.</hi> For when the terrors of the law only ſuit your caſe, you vainly catch at the comforts of the goſpel; or rather, you remain as unaffected under the threatnings of the one, as under the promiſes of the other: You look on mount Sinai and mount Sion with equal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference, and the warmth of the preacher, who invites you to <hi>fly from the wrath to come,</hi> appears to you an inſtance of religious madneſs. Nor is it a wonder it ſhould, while you conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue unacquainted with your danger: When a mortal diſeaſe is neither felt nor ſuſpected, a pathetic addreſs upon its conſequences and cure, muſt be received by any reaſonable man, with the greateſt unconcern; and the perſon that makes it in earneſt, muſt appear exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ridiculous. Again,</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>My people are deſtroyed for lack of knowledge,</hi> ſays the Lord. This is true, particularly with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the knowledge of our depravity. Reader! if thou remaineſt a ſtranger to it, thou wilt look upon ſlight confeſſions of outward ſins, as true repentance; and the <hi>godly ſorrow that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth repentance to ſalvation,</hi> will appear to thee a ſymptom of melancholy. Taking an external reformation of manners, or a change of ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and opinions, for true converſion, thou wilt think thyſelf in a ſafe ſtate, while thy heart continues habitually wandering from God, and under the dominion of a worldly ſpirit. In a word, ſome of the branches of the tree of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption thou mayſt poſſibly lop off, but the root will ſtill remain and gather ſtrength. For it is plain, that a bad root, ſuppoſed not to exiſt,
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:017930_0186_0FA37E1135B84DD8"/>
can neither be heartily lamented, nor earneſtly ſtruck at with the ax of ſelf-denial.</p>
                     <p>Even an Heathen could ſay, <note n="*" place="bottom">Initium eſt ſalutis notitia peccati, nam qui pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care ſe neſcit corrigi non vult: Deprehendas te op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portet antequam emendes. Sen. Ep. xxviii.—Et hoc ipſum argumentum eſt in melius tranſlati animi, quod vitia ſua, quae adhuc ignorabat, videt. Ep. vi.</note>
                        <q>The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſin, is the firſt ſtep towards ſalvation from it: For he, who knows not that he ſins, will not ſubmit to be ſet right: Thou muſt find out what thou art, before thou canſt mend thyſelf.—Therefore when thou diſcovereſt thy vices, to which thou waſt before a ſtranger, it is a ſign that thy ſoul is in a better ſtate.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. It is owing to the want of this diſcovery, O ye pretended ſons of reaſon, that thinking yourſelves born pure, or ſuppoſing the diſeaſe of your nature to be inconſiderable, you imagine it poſſible to be your own phyſicians, when you are only your own deſtroyers. Hence it is, that while you give to Jeſus the titular honour of <hi>Saviour,</hi> you ſpeak perpetually of being
<q>ſaved merely by your duties and beſt endeavours.</q>
Hear him warning you againſt this common deluſion: <hi>O Iſrael,</hi> ſays he, <hi>thou haſt deſtroyed thyſelf, but in</hi> ME <hi>is thy help found. The whole need not a phyſician, but they that are ſick,</hi> beyond all hopes of recovering themſelves.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The preſcriptions of this wiſe Phyſician, are exceſſively ſevere to fleſh and blood, and ſome of his remedies as violent as our diſeaſe. Therefore, except we ſee the greatneſs of our danger, we ſhall beg to be excuſed from taking the bitter potion. Who can have reſolution enough to <hi>cut off a right hand, to pluck out a right eye, to take up his croſs daily, to deny himſelf, and

loſe even his own life,</hi> or what is often dearer, his fair reputation?—Who, I ſay, can do this, till a ſight of imminent ruin on the one hand, and of redeeming love on the other, makes him ſubmit to the painful injunctions? Thou lovely youth, noted in the goſpel for thy harmleſsneſs, I appeal to thy wretched experience. When the Phyſician of ſouls, at whoſe feet thou waſt proſtrate, commanded thee to <hi>ſell all and follow him,</hi> what made thee <hi>go away ſorrowful</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done? Not barely thy <hi>great poſſeſſions,</hi> but the ignorance of thy condition: For <hi>all that a man hath will he give for his life,</hi> when he ſees it in immediate danger, Matt. xix. 22.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. If it is a deſperate ſtep to turn away from the Prince of life, it is a daring one to approach him with a mere compliment. Of this never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs you are guilty, ye unawakened ſinners, who daily appear before the throne of grace, with <hi>thanks</hi> and <hi>praiſes</hi> to God, <hi>for his ineſtimable love in the redemption of the world by our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> Alas! When you deny the ſtate of ſin and miſery, in which you are by nature, and yet preſume to thank God for <hi>redemption</hi> from it, do not you mock him as ſolemnly as you would the king, were you to preſent him every day an addreſs of thanks, for redeeming you from Turkiſh ſlavery, when you never knew yourſelves ſlaves in Turky? O how provoking to God muſt theſe unmeaning thankſgivings be! Surely one day they will be ranked among the indignities, offered by earthly worms to <hi>the Majeſty on High.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="11">11. Some indeed, more conſiſtent than you, openly throw off the maſk. Seeing neither the unfathomable depth of their miſery by the fall, nor the immenſe height of their aggravated ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities,
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:017930_0188_0FA37E1241F66548"/>
they do not trifle with, but at once <hi>deny, the Lord that bought them.</hi> Yes, far from admiring the eſtabliſhed method of a ſalvation, procured at ſo immenſe a price, as the incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and crucifixion of the Son of God, they are not afraid to intimate it is irrational: And upon their principles they may well do it; for if our ruin is not immenſe, what need is there for an immenſely glorious Redeemer? And if our guilt reaches not up to heaven, why ſhould the Son of God have come down from thence, to <hi>put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">12. As we ſlight or reject the Saviour, till we are truly convinced of the evil and danger of ſin; ſo we worſhip a falſe god, a mere idol. For, inſtead of adoring Jehovah, infinite in his holineſs and hatred of ſin, inviolable in the truth of his threatnings againſt it, and impartial in his ſtrict juſtice—a God in whoſe preſence unhum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſinners <hi>are not able to ſtand,</hi> and <hi>with whom evil cannot dwell</hi>; we bow to a <hi>ſtrange god,</hi> whom pious men never knew—a god formed by our own fancy, ſo <hi>unholy</hi> as to connive at ſin, ſo <hi>unjuſt</hi> as to ſet aſide his moſt righteous law, and ſo <hi>falſe</hi> as to break his ſolemn word, that we muſt <hi>turn or die,</hi> Ezek. xxxiii. 11. Is not this worſhipping a god of our own making; or as David deſcribes him, a <hi>god altogether ſuch as ourſelves?</hi> To adore an idol of paſte, made by the baker and the prieſt, may be indeed more fooliſh, but cannot be more wicked, than to adore one made by our wild imagination, and impious unbelief.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. We may go one ſtep farther ſtill, and affirm, that till we are deeply convinced of ſin, far from worſhipping the true God, [which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies knowing, loving, and admiring him in all
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:017930_0189_0FA37E1300B847C8"/>
his perfections] we hate and oppoſe him in his infinite <hi>holineſs</hi> and <hi>juſtice.</hi> The proof is obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: Two things diametrically oppoſite in their nature, can never be approved of at once. If we do not ſide with divine holineſs and juſtice, abhor our corruption, and condemn ourſelves as hell-deſerving ſinners; far from approving, we ſhall riſe againſt the holy and righteous God, who ſentences us to eternal death for our ſin: We ſhall at leaſt wiſh he were leſs pure and juſt than he is; which amounts to wiſhing him to be no God. While proud fiends betray this horrid diſpoſition, by loud blaſphemies in hell; ye do it, O ye unconvinced ſons of men, by your averſion to godlineſs upon earth. <hi>Haters of God,</hi> is then the proper name, and <hi>enmity againſt him,</hi> the ſettled temper of all unhumbled, unconverted ſinners, Rom. i. 30. and viii. 7.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. When the nature of God is miſtaken, what wonder if his law is miſapprehended? <hi>The law is good,</hi> ſays St. Paul, <hi>if a man uſe it lawfully</hi>; but if we make an improper uſe of it, the conſequence is fatal. Since the fall, the law of God, as contradiſtinguiſhed from the goſpel of Chriſt, points out to us the ſpotleſs holineſs, and inflexible juſtice, of its divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. It teaches us with what ardor and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy we ſhould love both our Creator and our fellow-creatures. As a bank caſt againſt the ſtream of our iniquity, it accidentally ſerves to make it riſe the higher, and to diſcover its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity; for <hi>by the law is the knowledge of ſin.</hi> It demonſtrates man's weakneſs, who <hi>conſents in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to the law that it is good, but finds not how to fulfil it,</hi> Rom. vii. 16, 19. As a battery erected againſt our pride, when it has its due effect, it ſilences all our ſelf-righteous pleas, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:017930_0190_0FA37E13B8A265D8"/>
us that a returning ſinner <hi>is not juſtified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Chriſt:</hi> a broken law, a <hi>law</hi> which <hi>worketh wrath,</hi> being abſolutely unable to abſolve its violator. — In a word, <hi>it is our ſchool-maſter to bring us to Chriſt,</hi> and drives us with the rod of threatned puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to make us touch the ſceptre of mercy, held out to us from the throne of grace.</p>
                     <p>But, while we remain ſtrangers to our help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and hopeleſs ſtate by nature, far from making this proper uſe of the law, we truſt in it, and fancy that the merit of our unſprinkled obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to it, is the way of ſalvation. Thus we <hi>go about to eſtabliſh our own righteouſneſs, making light of</hi> the atoning blood, which marks <hi>the new and living way</hi> to heaven. This very miſtake ruined the Phariſees of old, and deſtroys their numerous followers in all ages, Rom. ix. 31.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. And when we form ſuch wrong appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of the <hi>law,</hi> is it poſſible that we ſhould have right views of the <hi>goſpel,</hi> and receive it with cordial affection? Reaſon and experience anſwer in the negative. What ſays the goſpel to ſinners? <hi>You are ſaved</hi> BY GRACE, through mere favour and mercy, <hi>not</hi> by the covenant <hi>of works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt</hi> like the Phariſee, Eph. ii. 8. Now, ye decent formaliſts, ye fond admirers of your own virtue, are you not utterly diſqualified to ſeek and accept a pardon in a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel way? For your ſeeking it upon the footing of mere <hi>mercy,</hi> implies an acknowledgment, that you deſerve the ruin threatned againſt ſinners. And ſuppoſe a pardon were granted you, before you had a conſciouſneſs of your ſad deſerts, you could not receive it as an act of <hi>mere grace,</hi> but only as a reward juſtly beſtowed upon you for the merit of your works. It is plain then, that
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:017930_0191_0FA37E1479570420"/>
according to the goſpel plan, none can be fit ſubjects of ſalvation, but thoſe who are truly ſenſible of their condemnation.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. But as the grace of God in Chriſt, is the original and properly meritorious cauſe of our ſalvation: So the grand inſtrumental cauſe of it is <hi>faith</hi> on our part. <hi>Through faith are ye ſaved,</hi> ſays St. Paul. Now if to have faith in Chriſt, is habitually to lift up our hearts to him, with an humble and yet chearful confidence, ſeeking in him all our <hi>wiſdom, righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>ſtrength,</hi> as being our inſtructing <hi>Prophet,</hi> atoning <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and protecting <hi>King</hi>; it is evident, that till we awake to a ſight of our fallen ſtate, we cannot believe, nor conſequently be ſaved. O ye that never were ſenſible of your ſpiritual blindneſs, can you with ſincerity take Jeſus for your guide, and deſire his <hi>Spirit to lead you into all truth?</hi> Does not David's prayer. <hi>Open thou mine eyes, that I may ſee the wonderful things of thy law,</hi> appear to you needleſs, if not fanatical? And is not the Redeemer's <hi>prophetic office</hi> thrown away upon ſuch ſons of wiſdom as you are?</p>
                     <p>Have you a greater value for Jeſus than they, O ye <hi>juſt men,</hi> who have <hi>no</hi> ſenſible <hi>need</hi> of heart-felt <hi>repentance,</hi> and whoſe breaſts were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dilated by one ſigh, under a due ſenſe of your guilt and condemnation? Can you, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hypocriſy, apply to him as the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> of the <hi>guilty,</hi> claim him as the <hi>Advocate</hi> of the <hi>condemned,</hi> or fly to him as the <hi>Saviour</hi> of the <hi>loſt?</hi> Impoſſible! Ye fondly hope, ye never were loſt, ye were always
<q>good livers, good believers, good churchmen;</q>
ye
<q>need not make ſo much ado</q>
about an intereſt in the blood of the new covenant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="195" facs="unknown:017930_0192_0FA37E15382221E8"/>And ye, who fluſhed with the conceit of your native ſtrength, wonder at the weakneſs of thoſe, that continually bow to the ſceptre of Jeſus's grace for protection and power; can you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſmile of pity hear him ſay, <hi>Without me ye can do nothing?</hi> Is it poſſible that you ſhould ſincerely implore the exertion of his royal power, for victory over ſins, which you ſuppoſe your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves able to conquer; and for the reſtoration of a nature, with the goodneſs of which you are already ſo well ſatisfied? Your reaſon loudly anſwers, No: Therefore, till you ſee yourſelves corrupt, impotent creatures, you will openly neglect the Redeemer, give to your aggravated ſins the name of 'human frailties,' and truſt to your baffled, and yet boaſted endeavours. Self-deception! art thou not of all impoſtors the moſt common and dangerous, becauſe the leaſt ſuſpected?</p>
                     <p>To ſum up and cloſe theſe important remarks: Look at thoſe who, in myſtic Babylon, are not truly ſenſible of their total fall from God, and you will ſee them ſetting their own reaſon above the holy ſcriptures; and their works in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition with the infinitely meritorious ſacrifice of Chriſt. Inquire into their principles, and you will diſcover, that they either openly explode as enthuſiaſtical, or ſlightly receive as unneceſſary, the doctrines of ſalvation by faith in Chriſt, and regeneration by the Spirit of God. Examine their conduct, and you will find they all <hi>commit ſin,</hi> and <hi>receive the mark of the beaſt</hi> ſecretly <hi>in their right hand, or</hi> openly <hi>in their foreheads,</hi> Rev. xiii. 16. Sort them, and you will have two bands, the one of Sceptics and the other of Formaliſts, who, though <hi>at</hi> as great <hi>enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween themſelves</hi> as <hi>Pilate and Herod, are</hi> like

them <hi>made friends together,</hi> by jointly <hi>deriding</hi> and <hi>condemning</hi> JESUS in his living members.</p>
                     <p>And if with the candle of the Lord you ſearch the Jeruſalem of profeſſing Chriſtians, you will perceive that the want of an heart-felt, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling knowledge of their natural depravity, gives birth to the double-mindedneſs of hypocrites, and the miſcarriages or apoſtacy of thoſe, who once diſtinguiſhed themſelves in the evangelical race: You will eaſily trace back to the ſame corrupt ſource, the ſeemingly oppoſite errors of the <hi>looſe Antinomian,</hi> and the <hi>phariſaic Legaliſt,</hi> thoſe ſpiritual thieves, by whom the ſincere Chriſtian is perpetually reviled: And in ſhort, you will be convinced, that if you ſet your eyes upon a man, who is not yet deeply conſcious of his corrupt and loſt eſtate, or whoſe conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it has worn away, you behold either a trifler in religion, a dead-hearted Phariſee, a ſly hypocrite, a looſe Antinomian, a ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited formaliſt, a ſcoffing infidel, or a wretched apoſtate.</p>
                     <p>You ſee, reader, what a train of fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences reſults from rejecting, or not properly receiving, the doctrine demonſtrated in theſe ſheets: And now, that you may cordially em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it, permit me to enumerate the

                     <p>Again, no ſooner are we properly acquainted with our helpleſſneſs, than we give over leaning on an arm of fleſh, and the broken reed of our own reſolutions.

                     </note> ſerious and well-diſpoſed reader.

                  </p>
                  <p>Thou art happily weary of feeding upon the huſks of earthly vanities. I have a right there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as a ſteward of the myſteries of God, to bring out of the divine treaſury, the pearls of evangelical truth; and I gladly caſt them before

                     <hi>thee,</hi> perſuaded, that far from awakening thy anger, they will excite thy deſires, and animate thy languid hopes.</p>
                  <p>Inſtead of ridiculing, or dreading an heart-felt conviction of thy loſt eſtate, thou now ſeeſt it is a deſirable privilege, an invaluable bleſſing. Ready to mourn, becauſe thou canſt not mourn, thou complaineſt, that thou haſt only a confuſed view of thy total depravity.

                        <hi>PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS</hi> on the nature and depth of penitential ſorrow.</head>
                     <p n="1">I. Thou knoweſt, that <hi>except thou</hi> truly <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteſt, thou ſhalt</hi> ſurely <hi>periſh,</hi> and that there is no true repentance, where there is not true ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for ſin. <hi>I rejoice,</hi> ſays St. Paul to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, <hi>that ye were made ſorry after a godly manner: For godly ſorrow worketh repentance to ſalvation, not to be repented of; but the ſorrow of the world worketh death.</hi> Hence it appears, that there are two ſorts of ſorrow ſpringing from oppoſite ſources; <hi>God</hi> and <hi>the world</hi>; the one a <hi>godly ſorrow,</hi> and the other <hi>the ſorrow of the world.</hi> Learn to diſtinguiſh them by their various cauſes and effects, ſo ſhalt thou avoid the danger of miſtaking the one for the other.</p>
                     <p>The ſorrow of the world, which many cover
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:017930_0204_0FA37D9C8BEDBDD0"/>
with the cloak of religion, ariſes from fear of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, dread of poverty, ſecret jealouſy, revenge diſſatisfied, love diſappointed, baffled ſchemes, loſſes in buſineſs, unkindneſs of friends, provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of enemies, or the death of ſome idolized relative. Nay, this ſorrow may ſometimes ſpring from a mixture of ſelf-righteous pride and ſlaviſh fear. Some cannot bear to be robbed of their fond hopes of meriting heaven by their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary good works: They loſe all patience, when they ſee their beſt righteouſneſs brought to light, and expoſed as <hi>filthy rags:</hi> They are cut to the heart, when they hear, that their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent good deeds deſerve puniſhment as well as their black enormities: Or like condemned male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, they dread the conſequences of their crimes, while they feel little or no horror for the crimes themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Exceedingly fatal are the effects of this ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, in the perſons whom it overcomes: Their indignant hearts, unable to bear either diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, contradiction, or condemnation, riſe againſt ſecond cauſes, or againſt the decrees of providence; fret at the ſtrictneſs of the law, or holineſs of the Lawgiver; and pine away with uninterrupted diſcontent. Hence, ſpurning at advice, direction, and conſolation, they wring their hands, or <hi>gnaw their tongues with anguiſh</hi>; impatience works them up into ſtupid ſullen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or noiſy murmuring; they complain, that their <hi>puniſhment is greater than they can bear</hi>; and, imagining they are more ſeverely dealt with than others, they haſtily conclude. <hi>Behold, this evil is from the Lord, why ſhould I wait for him any longer?</hi> Thus black deſpair ſeizes upon their ſpirits; and, if grace does not interpoſe, they either live on <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

<pb n="210" facs="unknown:017930_0205_0FA37D9D459CA928"/>
iniquities, as Cain, Pharaoh, and Haman; or madly lay violent hands upon themſelves, as Ahitophel, and Judas.</p>
                     <p>This ſorrow cannot be too much guarded againſt, as it not only deſtroys many perſons, but does immenſe hurt to religion. For thoſe who are glad of any pretence to pour contempt upon godlineſs, taking occaſion from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this ſorrow, harden their own hearts, and prejudice all around them againſt the bleſſed, <hi>godly</hi> ſorrow, which every miniſter of the goſpel endeavours to excite; maliciouſly repreſenting it as one and the ſame with the miſchievous <hi>ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of the world.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Their miſtake will be evident, if we trace godly ſorrow back to its ſource. It does not ſpring merely from fear of puniſhment; but chiefly from humbling views of God's holineſs, the impurity of the human nature, the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinfulneſs of ſin, and the tranſcendent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the law, which condemns the ſinner.</p>
                     <p>And this happy ſorrow differs not leſs from the other in its effects, than it does in its cauſe. The perſons who are bleſſed with it, far from murmuring, or fretting at the divine command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſee it to be <hi>holy, juſt, and good,</hi> both in its preceptive and penal part. They ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely acquicſce in it, that they would not alter it, if they could. They clear God, accuſe themſelves, ſubſcribe their own ſentence, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, <hi>It is of the Lord's mercies, that we are not conſumed.</hi> Each of them can ſay, <hi>Wherefore ſhould a living man complain, a man for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſins? It is good that he ſhould both hope, and quietly wait for God's ſalvation: I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore watch to ſee what he will ſay unto me, for he will ſpeak peace unto his people.</hi>
                        <pb n="211" facs="unknown:017930_0206_0FA37D9E0DED8958"/>
Thus in a conſtant uſe of all the ordinances of God, they meekly wait, wreſtling with their unbelieving fears, till victorious <hi>faith comes by hearing</hi> of the matchleſs love of Jeſus Chriſt; and then, <hi>fearing the Lord and his goodneſs,</hi> they <hi>ſing the ſong of the Lamb,</hi> and run upon his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful errands.</p>
                     <p>As thou ſeeſt, ſerious reader, the nature, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and excellence of <hi>godly ſorrow,</hi> thou art probably deſirous of being informed, how deep thine muſt be, to conſtitute thee a <hi>true</hi> penitent. Know then, that it muſt be deep enough to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter thy moſt pleaſing, profitable, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual ſins, and to prevent thy reſting without a clear ſenſe of thy peculiar intereſt in Chriſt.— It muſt be profound enough to make him and his goſpel infinitely precious to thee, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, under God, the bleſſed effects mentioned in the fifth part of the preceding treatiſe.</p>
                     <p>To be more particular, a true penitent may certainly without deſpair or madneſs, go as far in godly ſorrow, as David does in his peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial pſalms, or our church in the firſt part of the homily on faſting.
<q>When good men, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> feel in themſelves the heavy burden of ſin, ſee damnation to be the reward of it, and behold with the eye of their mind the horror of hell, they tremble, they quake, they are inwardly touched with ſorrowfulneſs of heart for their offences, and cannot but accuſe themſelves, and open their grief unto Almighty God, and call on him for mercy. This being done ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, their mind is ſo occupied, partly with ſorrow and heavineſs, partly with an earneſt deſire to be delivered from this danger of hell and damnation, that all deſire of meat and drink is laid aſide, and loathing of all worldly
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:017930_0207_0FA37D9ECAFE9728"/>
things and pleaſures comes in place, ſo that they like nothing better than to weep, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to mourn, and both with words and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of body, to ſhew themſelves weary of this life.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs it muſt be obſerved, that godly ſorrow needs not be equal, either in degree or duration, in all penitents. Thoſe, whoſe hearts, through divine grace, open as readily and gently as that of Lydia, happily avoid many of David's pangs and Job's terrors. The powerful and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantaneous, or the gentle and gradual manner, in which ſouls are awakened; the difference of conſtitutions; the peculiar ſervices that a few are called to, and for which they are prepared by peculiar exerciſes; the horrid aggravations that have attended the ſins of ſome; and the ſevere correction, which the Lord is obliged to give others, for their ſtout reſiſtance againſt his grace—all this may help us to account for the various depths of diſtreſs, through which differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent penitents paſs in their way to Chriſt and ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>The Lord does not needleſsly afflict the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, any more than a tender father un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarily corrects his diſobedient children: He only wants us to forſake our ſins, renounce our own imaginary righteouſneſs, and come to Chriſt to be made partakers of his merits, holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and felicity. The ſorrow, which anſwers theſe ends, is quite ſufficient; though it ſhould be ever ſo light, and of ever ſo ſhort a duration. On the contrary, a diſtreſs as heavy as that of Judas is unavailable, if inſtead of driving us from ſin to Jeſus Chriſt, it only drives us from profaneneſs to hypocriſy, or from preſumption to deſpair.</p>

View in that faithful mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, the picture both of the natural and of the regenerate man, and aſk thy conſcience which thou reſembleſt moſt. If, imitating the godly man deſcribed in the firſt pſalm, thou <hi>meditateſt in the law of the Lord day and night</hi>; the ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the heavenly rule will ſoon ſhew thee how very far gone thy thoughts, words, actions, tempers, and nature, are from original righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</p>
                     <p>To this meditation, add a frequent ſurvey of the follies of thy childhood, the vanity of thy youth, the worldly-mindedneſs of thy riper years, the capital tranſgreſſions which conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence accuſes thee of, and the <hi>hardneſs of heart,</hi> and <hi>alienation from the life of God,</hi> that the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures charge thee with. Confeſs all to the Lord as thou art able, remembering that the wages of ſin is <hi>death,</hi> who flies faſt upon thee
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:017930_0210_0FA37DA10EFC5978"/>
with the wings of time—<hi>Death,</hi> who often gives no warning, and uſhers in <hi>judgment,</hi> with all the horrors of <hi>hell,</hi> or the joys of <hi>heaven</hi>; and pray, that theſe awful realities may affect thee now, as they will in thy laſt moments.</p>
                     <p>Frequently reflect, how total muſt be our loſs of ſpiritual life, which cannot be repaired but by a <hi>reſurrection,</hi> a <hi>new birth,</hi> or <hi>a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Col. iii. 1. John iii. 7. Gal. vi. 5. and how deſperate the diſeaſe of our fallen nature, which cannot be healed but with the blood of a divine Phyſician. <hi>Conſider,</hi> attentively conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Him,</hi> whoſe piercing look ſoftened the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate heart of curſing Peter, whoſe amazing ſufferings brought an hardened thief under the deepeſt concern for his ſalvation, and whoſe dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing groans <hi>rent the rocks, ſhook the earth, and opened the graves.</hi> The tender flower of evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical ſorrow grows beſt in the ſhade of his croſs: A believing view of him, as ſuffering for thee, will melt thee into penitential tears, and ſeal upon thy relenting heart the gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>They ſhall look upon him, whom they have pierced, and mourn,</hi> Zech. xii. 10.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, improve the daily oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, which thou haſt of ſtudying human corruption in the life and tempers of all around thee, but chiefly in thy own careleſs and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful heart: Take notice of its pride and ſelf-ſeeking, of its riſings and ſecret workings, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when unexpected temptations trouble thy imaginary peace of mind: For, at ſuch a time, thy corruption, like the ſediment in the bottom of a vial that is ſhaken, will ſhew its loathſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>Converſe frequently, if thou canſt, with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons deeply convinced of ſin. Attend a plain,
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:017930_0211_0FA37DA1CBBB0570"/>
heart-ſearching miniſtry as often as poſſible; and when the ſword of the Spirit, the word of God, pierces thy ſoul, beware of fretful impatience. Inſtead of riſing with indignation againſt the preacher, and ſaying, as proud Ahab did to the man of God, <hi>Haſt thou found me, O mine enemy?</hi> account him thy beſt friend, that wounds thee deepeſt, provided he brings thee to Chriſt for a cure: And when the arrows of the word fly abroad, drop the ſhield of unbelief, make bare thy breaſt, welcome the bleſſed ſhaft, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that the only way of conquering ſin, is to fall wounded and helpleſs at the Redeemer's feet.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs the impreſſions of the word will ſoon wear off, if thou doſt not importunately intreat the Searcher of hearts, to light the candle of his grace in thy ſoul, that thou mayeſt clearly ſee whether thy <hi>inward parts</hi> are <hi>holineſs to the Lord,</hi> as thou fondly ſuppoſeſt; or <hi>very wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> as the ſcripture teſtifies. It is only in God's light, that we can clearly diſcover our blindneſs.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>light,</hi> it is true, <hi>ſhineth in darkneſs,</hi> but frequently <hi>the darkneſs comprehendeth it not.</hi> That this be not thy dreadful caſe, do not <hi>grieve</hi> and <hi>quench the</hi> convincing <hi>Spirit,</hi> by perſiſting in the <hi>wilful</hi> omiſſion of any duty, or <hi>deliberate</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of any ſin: Nothing but <hi>obſtinate unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi> darkens the mind, and hardens the heart, more than this. Therefore inſtead of burying thy <hi>one talent</hi> with <hi>the ſlothful ſervant,</hi> earneſtly pray the Lord to make thee faithful to thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, and to deepen them daily till they end in a ſound converſion.</p>
                     <p>In order to this, do not ſlightly heal the wound in thy conſcience: It is better to keep

it open, than to ſkin it over by improper means: Many, through a natural forwardneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, have recourſe to them; and ruin is the conſequence of their miſtake. That thou mayſt avoid it, ſerious reader, I intreat thee to pay a due regard to the following</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="cautions">
                     <head>
                        <hi>CAUTIONS,</hi> Proper for a penitent, who deſires to make his calling and election <hi>SURE.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p n="3">III. When thou haſt affecting views of thy loſt eſtate, beware of reſting like Felix in ſome pangs of fear, fits of trembling, and reſolutions of turning to God by and by, <hi>when</hi> thou <hi>ſhalt have a convenient ſeaſon.</hi> Neither give place to deſponding thoughts, as if there was no appeal from the tribunal of juſtice to the throne of grace.</p>
                     <p>Run not for eaſe to vain company, bodily indulgence, entangling affections, immoderate ſleep, exceſſive drinking, or hurry of buſineſs. <hi>Cain built a city</hi> to divert his trouble of mind, and multitudes like him, by <hi>the cares of this world, the deceitfulneſs of riches, or the deſire of other things,</hi> daily <hi>choak</hi> the good ſeed, the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>word</hi> of conviction, Mark iv, 19.</p>
                     <p>Be not ſatisfied with faint deſires of living the life of the righteous, or idle wiſhes of dying their death. Remember that <hi>the deſire of the ſlothful kills him:</hi> and if thou haſt experienced ſome drawings of grace, meltings of heart, or breathings after God; ſit not down at laſt, as the Laodiceans, in a careleſs ſtate, <hi>neither hot nor cold.</hi> It is far better to go on thy way

weeping, and ſeeking <hi>the pearl of great price</hi> till thou really find it, than to reſt contented with an haſty conceit that thou art poſſeſſed of it, when thou art not.</p>
                     <p>Stop not in an outward reformation, and a form of godlineſs, like many, who miſtake the <hi>means</hi> or <hi>doctrines of grace</hi> for grace itſelf; and becauſe they ſay their heartleſs prayers both in public and private, or go far and often to hear the goſpel preached in its purity, fondly hope, that they are the favourites of God, and in the high way to heaven.</p>
                     <p>Under pretence of increaſing thy convictions, do not bury them in heaps of religious books. Some read till their heads are confuſed, or their hearts <hi>paſt feeling.</hi> Thus, though <hi>ever learning, they are never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. Hear</hi> then, as well as <hi>read</hi> the word of life; but think not thyſelf converted when thou haſt <hi>received it with joy:</hi> The ſtony-ground hearers went as far as this: <hi>Herod</hi> himſelf <hi>heard John gladly, honoured him, did many things,</hi> but left the moſt important undone; for he never diſmiſſed the inceſtuous woman he lived with; and at laſt ſacrificed to her revenge, the honeſt preacher he once admired.</p>
                     <p>Do not confound the <hi>covenant of works</hi> made with <hi>innocent</hi> Adam <hi>before</hi> the fall, and the <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace</hi> made with <hi>ſinful</hi> Adam <hi>after</hi> the fall, Gen. ii. 17. and iii. 15. and Rom. v. 11.—21. They are excellent in their place, but when they are mixed together, they deſtroy each other's efficacy. The dreadful thunders, heard in paradiſe loſt; and the melodious ſongs uttered in paradiſe regained, do not ſtrike <hi>at once</hi> the ſame ſpiritual ear. The galling yoke of the law of works, and the heavy load of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:017930_0214_0FA37DA4EDC66DF8"/>
are dropt; when we take upon us Chriſt's eaſy yoke, and ſubmit to his light bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. In a word, the firſt Adam gives place to the ſecond when we <hi>find reſt unto our ſouls.</hi> Let then the <hi>curſe</hi> of the law of innocence, be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the <hi>bleſſing</hi> of the goſpel: or rather, let it make way for the grace of Chriſt in thy ſoul, as an emetic makes way for a cordial in a diſordered ſtomach. If thou takeſt them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, their reſpective uſe is prevented. The firſt covenant loſes its <hi>humbling</hi> efficacy, and the ſecond its <hi>reſtorative</hi> power. Therefore, if thou haſt really <hi>received the ſentence of death in thyſelf</hi>; leave the curſe of the firſt covenant in the grave of Chriſt, <hi>crucified for thy ſins</hi>; and welcome the pardoning, renovating grace of Chriſt, <hi>riſen again for thy juſtification.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On the other hand, reſt not contented with ſpeculative knowledge, and unaffecting, though clear ideas of the goſpel-way of ſalvation. Light in an unrenewed underſtanding, miſtaken for the <hi>myſtery of faith in a pure heart,</hi> like an ignis fatuus, or falſe light, leads thouſands through the bogs of ſin into the pit of deſtruction, Acts viii. 13.</p>
                     <p>Pacify not thy conſcience by activity in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſervices, and a warmth in God's cauſe: Party ſpirit, or natural ſteadineſs in carrying on a favourite ſcheme, yea, or ſeeking thy own glory, may be the ſprings that ſet thee on work. Jehu faithfully deſtroyed Baal and Jezebel, but his zeal for the Lord covered the ſecret deſire of a crown. Take care alſo not to miſtake gifts for graces; fluency of ſpeech for convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power, the warmth of natural affection for divine love; or an impulſe of God's Spirit, on ſome particular occaſion, for an evidence of

ſpiritual regeneration, Balaam ſpoke and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied like a child of God, and <hi>many will one day ſay to</hi> Chriſt, <hi>Lord, have we not propheſied, ſpoke all myſteries, caſt out devils, and done many wonderful works in thy name?</hi> to whom he will anſwer, <hi>Depart from me, I know you not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Avoid the ſelf-conceit of many, who feed on the corrupted manna of their paſt experiences, and confidently appeal to the waſted ſtreams of thoſe conſolations, which once refreſhed their hearts; when, alas! it is evident, <hi>they have</hi> now <hi>forſaken the fountain of living water,</hi> and <hi>hewn to themſelves broken ciſterns that held no water</hi>; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the mire of evil tempers, ſelfiſh views, and heartleſs profeſſions of faith, may paſs for <hi>the ſtreams which gladden the city of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Neither do thou heal thyſelf by touches of ſorrow, by tears, good deſires, or outward marks of humiliation for ſin, as king Ahab. Nor by exceſſive faſting, retiring from buſineſs, or hard uſage of the body, as many Roman Catholics: nor yet by miſapplying the doctrine of predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and ſetting down notions of election for evidences of ſalvation, as many Proteſtants: No, nor by <hi>doting about queſtions, ſtrifes of words, and perverſe diſputings, which eat as a canker,</hi> as ſome in St. Paul's days, and too many in ours, 1 Tim. vi. 4.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, think not thou art abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely made whole when the power of outward ſin is weakened or ſuſpended, when thou haſt learned the language of Canaan, canſt ſpeak or write well on ſpiritual ſubjects, art intimately acquainted with the beſt miniſters of Chriſt, and haſt caſt thy lot among the deſpiſed chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, taken their part, ſhared in their reproach, and ſecured their eſteem and prayers.

Judas did ſo for years: <hi>Saul was</hi> once <hi>alſo among the prophets:</hi> Ananias and Sapphira were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be good believers for a time, the fooliſh virgins joined in ſociety with the wiſe, and were perhaps unſuſpected, to the laſt; and Peter himſelf ſtood in need of <hi>converſion,</hi> long after he had outwardly <hi>left all to follow Chriſt,</hi> Luke xxii. 32.

faith; becauſe it chiefly grew from the ſeed of prejudice and education, as the faith of Jews and Turks; and not from the ſeed of divine grace and power, as the faith of St. Paul, Gal. i. 15. and becauſe it never yielded the heavenly fruits which <hi>goſpel faith</hi> infallibly produces: Such as—<hi>a vital union with Chriſt,</hi> Gal. ii. 20. <hi>The pardon of ſins,</hi> Col. i. 14. Acts xiii. 30.—<hi>Peace with God,</hi> Rom. v. 1.—<hi>Dominion over ſin,</hi> Rom. vi. 14.—<hi>Victory over the world,</hi> 1 John v. 4.— <hi>The crucifixion of the fleſh,</hi> Gal. v.—<hi>Power to quench the fiery darts of the wicked,</hi> Eph. vi. 15.— <hi>Joy unſpeakable,</hi> 1 Pet. i. 8.—<hi>And the ſalvation of thy ſoul,</hi> 1 Pet. i. 9. Heb. x. 39.</p>
                     <p>Be not afraid of this conviction of unbelief; for it generally goes before divine faith, as the fermentation of a grain of corn in the earth, is previous to its ſhooting its ſtalk towards heaven. <hi>God concludes,</hi> ſhuts us up <hi>in unbelief,</hi> ſays St. Paul, <hi>that he may have mercy upon</hi> us, Rom. xi. 32. <hi>When the comforter is come,</hi> ſays our Lord, <hi>he will convince the world of ſin, becauſe they believe not in me.</hi> This is the tranſgreſſion which peculiarly deſerves the name of <hi>ſin,</hi> as being the <hi>damning</hi> ſin according to the goſpel, Mark xvi. 16. the ſin that binds upon us the guilt of all our other iniquities, and keeps up the power of all our corruptions. Its immediate effect is to <hi>harden the heart,</hi> Mark xvi. 14. and make <hi>it depart from the living God,</hi> Heb. iii 12: and this hardneſs and departure are the genuine parents of all our actual ſins, the number and blackneſs of which increaſes or decreaſes, as the ſtrength of unbelief grows or decays.</p>
                     <p>A conviction of this ſin is of the utmoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, as nothing but an affecting ſenſe of its heinouſneſs and power, can make us entirely

weary of ourſelves—nothing but a ſight of its deſtructive nature can prevent our reſting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a compleat cure.</p>
                     <p>But when thou art once convinced of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, do not increaſe the difficulty of believing, by imagining true faith at an immenſe diſtance. Conſider it as very near thy heart. That which convinces thee of ſin and unbelief can in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and with the greateſt eaſe, convince thee of righteouſneſs, and <hi>reveal in thee Chriſt the hope of glory.</hi> How quickly can the Spirit take of the things that belong to him, and ſhow them unto thee! <hi>Say not</hi> then <hi>in thy heart, Who ſhall aſcend into heaven, or deſcend into the deep</hi> to get me the ſeed of faith? But let St. Paul ſhew thee <hi>the new and living way. The word is nigh thee,</hi> ſays he, <hi>even in thy mouth and in thy heart, that is the word of faith which we preach; that if thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thy heart that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved</hi>; for <hi>we are ſaved by faith; faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.

For JEHOVAH <hi>our righteouſneſs</hi> is <hi>the Seed of the woman and the Son of man:</hi> The Godhead and the manhood are wonderfully joined in him: And in conſequence of this myſterious union, he is not only a proper <hi>mediator between God and man,</hi> but the ſole medium of reconciliation and union, between the offended Majeſty of heaven and the rebellious ſons of Adam. As the brazen ſerpent lifted up in the wilderneſs, when viewed by the wounded Iſraelites, was the only means by which the poiſon of the fiery ſerpents could be expelled, and health reſtored to their tortured, dying bodies: So Jeſus lifted up on the croſs, when beheld by the eye of faith, as bleeding and dying in our ſtead, is the only way by which ſin, the ſting of death, can be extracted out of our guilty, periſhing ſouls: the only antidote that can reſtore us to ſaving health and eternal life, John iii, 14. Apply whatever we will, beſides this ſovereign remedy, we may poiſon, but can never heal the enve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomed and mortal wound.</p>

Though his riches were immenſe and unſearchable like himſelf, though heaven was his throne, and earth his footſtool, he became poor, and was deſtitute of a place where to lay his head, that we might be rich in faith here, and heirs of the kingdom hereafter. Though he was, is now, and ever ſhall be the joy of the heavenly powers, and the object of their deepeſt adoration; he was voluntarily deſpiſed of men, that we might be honoured of God: He was acquainted too with griefs, that we might rejoice with joy unſpeakable and full of glory, Tho' ſupreme Lawgiver and Judge of all, matchleſs love made him yield to be judged, and unjuſtly condemned at Pilate's bar, that we might be

                     <p>He is even now near to thy heart; he ſtands at the door, and gently knocks by the word of his grace.

                     <p>But perhaps thy guilty heart receives no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation from theſe lines.

And how ſoon would thy gloomy fears give place to triumphant joy, if thy thoughts of him correſponded with his gracious deſigns concerning thee!</p>
                     <p>Wouldſt thou know him better; behold him through the glaſs of his word, and not through the miſt of thy fears; and thou wilt ſee that, far from watching over thee for evil, he fixes upon thee the piercing eye of his redeeming love; waits, that he may be gracious to thy

                        <p>Not by works of righteouſneſs which thou haſt done, but according to my mercy I ſaved thee. I am the Lamb ſlain from the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world. What my gracious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe plann'd before time, I have executed in time. My life and death have compleated the wonderful bridge, by which thou canſt go over the great deep fixed between an holy God, and thy ſinful ſoul. Concerning a main arch of this mighty work, with one of my laſt breaths I ſaid, <hi>It is finiſhed</hi>; and I now confirm the glad tidings with regard to the whole. With my right hand, and with my holy arm, I have gotten myſelf the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and parted for thee, not the waves of the red ſea, but the dreadful billows of the fiery gulph.

                        <p>Whence ariſes, ſinner, this backwardneſs to truſt in my promiſe, and venture after me? Doſt thou ſuſpect the ſincerity of my tenders of grace? And by thinking, that I ſecretly except thee from my mercy, when I offer it thee openly, doſt thou ſtill make me a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembler, a liar? O wrong me not ſo far. I am the Truth itſelf: I abhor diſſimulation in my creatures: And I, that ſay, A man ſhould not uſe deceit, ſhall I uſe deceit? Shall I have

concord with Belial? Shall there be an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between the faithful Witneſs, and the father of lies? Shall I ſentence him, that loveth a lie, to the lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone, and be guilty of making one myſelf? Horrible to ſuppoſe! Reject the blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous thought, ſinner, it wounds me in the tendereſt part.</p>
                        <p>No, no, I do not put on a maſk of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended love, to hide a rancorous, unforgiving temper: The general invitation that formerly paſſed my lips, is ſtill the very language of my heart, <hi>Whoſoever will, let him come and take of the water of life freely</hi>; and the promiſe which I formerly made, is ſtill firmer than the pillars of heaven, <hi>Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> Let theſe words, like incorruptible ſeed, beget thee again to a lively hope, and help thee to ſtir thyſelf up to lay hold on me, and my great ſalvation.</p>
                        <p>I grant <hi>that no man cometh unto me, except the Father draw him:</hi> But does he not ſay, I have loved thee with an everlaſting love, therefore <hi>with loving-kindneſs, with the cords of a man, with bands of love have I drawn thee?</hi> Does he not draw thee even now? Who ſtirs thee up to repentance? Who raiſes in thee a deſire of coming unto me by prayer? Who indulges thee at times with ſweet hopes and alluring joys, to encourage thee to come? Is it not my Father, and thine, thou poor, ſtarving prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal? And that nothing may be wanting on his part to make thee come, to drawing does he not add driving? Does he not obſtruct all thy proſpects of creature-happineſs, and blaſt all thy worldly, yea, and all thy ſelf-righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſchemes? And while he touches thy heart

with the rod of diſtreſs, does he not lay the ſcourge of affliction on thy back, and put this gracious invitation in thy hand? Away then with thy hard thoughts of my Father: He and I are a flame of eternal love: I and the Father are one.</p>
                        <p>Neither ſay thou in thy heart, This is a day of trouble, rebuke, and blaſphemy; the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are come to the birth, and there is not ſtrength to bring forth. Shall I bring to the birth, and not give ſtrength according to the day? Doſt thou fear that my zeal, my ſtrength, and the ſounding of my bowels towards thee are reſtrained? Am not I Jeſus ſtill? Is my love waxed cold that it cannot pity? Is my hand ſhortened at all that it cannot ſave? Is mine ear heavy that it cannot hear? Or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the ſea, I clothe the heaven with blackneſs; and if, in the greateſt ſtorm, I ſay to the raging billows. <hi>Be ſtill!</hi> There is a great calm: Fear not then, the zeal of the Lord of hoſts—my zeal will do this, and more, for thy ſoul; yea, I will do for thee exceeding abundantly above all that thou canſt aſk or think.</p>
                        <p>I ſee what paſſes in thy heart, O thou un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe and ſlow of heart to believe, all that I and my prophets have ſpoken: I read thy new excuſes. Thou ſayſt thou doſt not ſuſpect me, my faithfulneſs and my power; but thyſelf, thy helpleſſneſs, and the treachery of thy own deſperately wicked heart.—What! ſhall this ſore evil hinder thee from coming to me, who alone can remedy it?

Conſider not the deadneſs and hardneſs of thy heart, but the reviving, ſoftening love of mine; not thy want of power, but my om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence; not the ſuggeſtion of Satan, but the declarations of my goſpel.

                        <p>Thou haſt played with the fiery ſerpents, they have bitten thy heart, but I have already ſuck'd the worſt of the mortal poiſon. In the perilous attempt my ſoul was ſeized with ſorrow even unto death, and an unheard-of agony, attended with a bloody ſweat, came upon my body. A racking croſs was the bed I was ſtretched upon: Sharp thorns proved the pillow on which I reſted my faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing head. The bittereſt ſarcaſms were my conſolations; vinegar and gall my cordials; a band of bloody ſoldiers the cruel wretches appointed to tear open my veins; whips, nails, hammers, and a ſpear, the inſtruments allowed them to do the dreadful operation. For hours I bled under their mercileſs hands: And thy fearful curſe, O ſinner, flowed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with my blood. In the mean time, noon-day light was turned into the gloom of night, a dire emblem of the darkneſs that overſpread my agonizing ſoul: And at laſt, while earthquakes rocked me into the ſleep of death, I gave up the ghoſt, with cries that aſtoniſhed my bittereſt enemies, and made them ſmite their breaſts in pangs of involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:017930_0250_0FA37DC13A993498"/>
ſympathy. Thus, to make thee partaker of my ſaving health, I took the ſhameful and painful conſequences of thy mortal diſtemper upon me. And now, ſinner, deſpiſe no more ſuch amazing love, requite it with a believing look. Conſider my wounds, till thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence feels their wonderful effect. Behold my atoning blood, till thou canſt witneſs it heals all thy infirmities.</p>
                        <p>Knowing the terrors of the Lord, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade men. Come, thou poor priſoner of hope, turn by faith to the ſtrong hold of my protection.—Up! for God will deſtroy this Sodom, the wicked world where thou linger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt —Up! for the great and terrible day of the Lord approaches.—As I live, there is but one ſtep between thee and death, and another between death and hell.</p>
                        <p>Let my love even conſtrain thee to ariſe, and to follow me, that I may receive thee unto myſelf, and complain no longer, that, with reſpect to thee, I have laboured in vain, and ſpent my ſtrength for nought. Surely, ſinner, I deſerve thy grateful love, for I have fought thy fierceſt enemies. Dreadful was the battle! My fleſh was torn, my blood ſpilt, my life loſt in the obſtinate combat: But I have ſlain the lion and the bear, I have vanquiſhed Death and the Grave, and reſcued thy poor, helpleſs ſoul: And now let thy good Shepherd rejoice over his loſt ſheep: Let gratitude compel thee to come into the fold of my church, and join the little flock of my faithful followers. And if thou canſt not come, do but look wiſhfully at me, and I will lay thee on my ſhoulders rejoicing, and

carry thee in triumph into the richeſt paſtures of my grace.</p>
                        <p>Once more I turn ſupplicant: Once more I ſtand at the door and knock—Saul! Saul! It is hard for thee to kick againſt the ſharp goads of my love—Martha! Martha! one thing is needful, Chuſe the good part, chuſe me—O Abſalom, my ſon! my ſon! Give me thy heart; I have died for thee, do not crucify me afreſh—Lay down the ſpear of unbelief, and thine is my grace, my glory, my kingdom, the kingdom of heaven.</p>
                        <p>Be not afraid to ſurrender; rebellious as thou art, I love thee ſtill—Can a woman for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get her ſucking child, that ſhe ſhould not have compaſſion on the ſon of her womb? Yea, ſhe may forget, yet will I not forget thee. If thou wilt not take my word, believe my oath: Becauſe I can ſwear by no greater, I ſwear by myſelf: <hi>As I live, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked,</hi> but that the wicked turn from his way and live: Turn then, turn unto me, for I have redeemed thee: I have caſt all thy ſins into the depth of the ſea, and will ſubdue all thy iniquities.</p>

Long, too long have I waited for thy return, thou poor, wandering, weary prodigal. Let me ſee in thee the travel of my ſoul, and be ſatisfied. By the myſtery of my holy incarnation and dreadful temptation, by my agony and bloody ſweat, by my infamous death and glorious reſurrection, I beſeech thee, come to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning God by me. If thou haſt nothing

Only let me heal thy backſlidings, and love thee freely; let my left hand be under thy head, and let my right hand embrace thee. See the wounds which I have received for thee in the houſe of my friends! Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thruſt it into my ſide, and be not faithleſs, but believing. Cleave to me with full purpoſe of heart, follow me through the regeneration, and thou ſhalt not only be one of my jewels, but a crown of glory, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God: Yea, as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, ſo will I rejoice over thee, and give thee a name better than that of Son and Daughter—I, the Holy One of Iſrael, will be thy life and glory—I, thy Maker, will be thy huſband, and thy all.</p>

May the Almighty now be juſt, and yet the juſtifier of him that believeth in Jeſus? Is there no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, no reſpect of perſons with him?

                     <p>Be no longer afraid, that it will be preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in thee to believe, and that God will be offended with thee, if thou makeſt ſo free with Jeſus, as to waſh inſtantly in the fountain of his atoning blood. He not only gives thee LEAVE to believe, but he INVITES thee to <hi>do it freely.</hi> Nay, he COMMANDS thee to believe, for <hi>This is his</hi> COMMANDMENT, <hi>that we ſhould believe on the name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He even enforces the precept by a double PROMISE, that if thou believeſt, thou <hi>ſhalt not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> And that nothing may be wanting to ſtir thee up to this important buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he is gracious enough to threaten the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of it with the moſt dreadful PUNISHMENT; for <hi>he that believeth not, ſhall not enter into his reſt,</hi> and <hi>ſhall be damned</hi>; and that he that to the end remains <hi>fearful and unbelieving, ſhall be caſt into the lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond death.</hi> How canſt thou doubt then, whether thou art welcome to receive <hi>the Son given,</hi> by believing on his name?</p>
                     <p>Come to him juſt as thou art, and he will make thee what thou ſhouldſt be. When he counſels thee to buy of him the gold of faith, and the garment of ſalvation, take him at his goſpel word: Come without regarding thy ſtuff: The poorer thou art, the better: The oil of his grace flows moſt abundantly into empty veſſels: His charity is moſt glorified in the relief of the moſt miſerable objects: His royal bounty ſcorns the vile compenſation of thy wretched merits: He ſells like a king, like the King of kings, without money and without

price. <hi>Aſk and have,</hi> and <hi>Take freely,</hi> are the encouraging mottos written upon all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable treaſures of his grace.</p>
                     <p>Be of good comfort then, riſe, he calleth thee: Stretch out thy withered hand, and he will reſtore it: Open thy mouth wide, and he will fill it: Bring an empty veſſel, a poor, hungry heart, and he will give into thy boſom good meaſure, preſſed down, ſhaken together, and running over.</p>
                     <p>And now what meaneſt thou, ſleeper? Why tarrieſt thou? Ariſe, and waſh away thy ſins, calling on the name of the Lord. Loſe not time in conferring with fleſh and blood; much leſs in parleying with Satan, or conſulting thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing heart: Here delays lead to ruin: The Philiſtines are upon thee, inſtantly ſhake thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: If thou art not altogether blinded by the god of this world, and led captive by him at his will; this moment, in the powerful name of JESUS, burſt the bonds of ſpiritual ſloth—break, like a deſperate ſoul, out of the priſon of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief —eſcape for thy life—look not behind thee—ſtay not in all the plain.—This one thing do; leaving the things that are behind, Sodom and her ways, preſs forwards towards Zoar, and eſcape to the mount of God, leſt thou be conſumed. By the new and living way conſecrated for us, in full aſſurance of faith, fly to the Father of mercies—paſs through the croud of Laodicean profeſſors—preſs through the opening door of hope—take the kingdom of heaven by violence.</p>
                     <p>With halting, yet wreſtling Jacob, ſay to the Friend of ſinners, <hi>I will not let thee go unleſs thou bleſs me.</hi> If he makes as if he would go farther;

                     <p>But perhaps thou art now devoid of active power, and broken in ſpirit. The hurry of thy ſelf-righteous nature ſubſides. Wounded and half dead, thou lieſt in the way of miſery, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the paſſing by of thy heavenly Deliverer. Thou hadſt ſet thy heart upon being bleſſed in one particular manner, and God in his wiſdom thinks it beſt to bleſs thee in another. Thou wouldſt ſcale the new Jeruſalem and ſtorm hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; but he chuſes it ſhould come down into thy ſoul as a fruitful ſhower deſcends into a fleece of wool. Be ſtill then, and know that he is God. Let him break thy ſelf-will, which hides itſelf under godly appearances; and let him practically teach thee, that ſalvation is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth; but of God who ſheweth mercy.</p>
                     <p>Meekly dive into the amazing depth of theſe words, <hi>In quietneſs and reſt ſhall be your ſtrength. Stand ſtill and ſee the ſalvation of God.</hi> The fire,

Thou art for a time taken from the foaming billows of ſelf agitation, and led by the ſtill waters; a calm ſucceeds the impetuous ſtorm, and a paſſive waiting thy reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, fruitleſs endeavours. Thou art in the caſe of one fallen into the ſea, who having ſtruggled long and hard to eſcape drowning, is obliged to yield at laſt. Yield then, weary ſinner, yield to thy happy fate. Fully ſurrender to the God of thy life. Entirely abandon thyſelf to Jeſus. Freely truſt him with thy preſent and eternal ſalvation. Whether thou ſwim or ſink, let thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf go into the ocean of mercy. Catch at no broken reed by the way, but calmly venture into the unfathomable depths of redeeming love. Loſe thus thy life, and thou ſhalt find it. The <hi>power</hi> of God will ſoon be <hi>made perfect in thy weakneſs</hi>; and when thy ſtrength is renewed, earneſtly wreſtle again. Thus go on, alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately ſtriving and waiting, according to the leadings of the Holy Spirit, till, having paſſed through all the interior diſpenſations of divine grace, thou enter by faith into the reſt that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains for the people of God, and take poſſeſſion of that kingdom of God, which conſiſts in righteouſneſs, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</p>

generation, among whom I allow thee to ſhine, as a burning light in a benighted world. Son! all that I have is thine, be ever with me, and thou ſhalt inherit all things. Yes, whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas; whether my firſt apoſtles, or my choice mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; or the world, or life, or death, or things preſent, or things to come; all is thine, for thou art Chriſt's, and Chriſt is mine.

                     <p>Start not, believing reader, at theſe ſayings, as if they were too glorious to be credited. They are the true ſayings of God. The Lord himſelf ſpoke them for thy comfort. They are the precious pearls, which I promiſed thee out of the unſearchable treaſures of Chriſt: If ſwine trample them under their feet, wear thou them on thy breaſt. Inſtead of being offended at their tranſcendent excellence, magnify the God of all conſolation, who, having <hi>delivered up his own Son for us all, with him alſo freely gives us all things,</hi> conſequently the richeſt mines of goſpel grace. And giving vent to the juſt tranſports of thy grateful heart, cry out with the beloved diſciple, <hi>Behold what manner of love the Father hath beſtowed upon us, that</hi> WE <hi>ſhould be called the ſons of God!—Unto Him who</hi> thus <hi>loved us, and waſhed us from our ſins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and prieſts to God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever.</hi> Amen.</p>

                     <hi>APPENDIX,</hi> Concerning the evangelical harmony that ſubſiſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween living faith and loving obedience.</head>
                  <p>THE myſtery of our ſalvation is thus opened by St. Paul, <hi>By</hi> GRACE <hi>are ye ſaved, through faith, which</hi> WORKETH <hi>by love.</hi> This apoſtolic declaration ſubdivides itſelf into the following propoſitions, which, on account of their clearneſs and importance, may, with propriety, be called GOSPEL AXIOMS. 1. <hi>Ye are ſaved by</hi> GRACE. 2. <hi>Ye are ſaved through a faith which</hi> WORKS <hi>by love.</hi> Theſe propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, like two adamantine pillars, ſupport the whole doctrine of Chriſt, concerning <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>works; grace</hi> and <hi>rewardableneſs</hi>; or <hi>mercy</hi> on God's part, and <hi>obedience</hi> on our own:—A doctrine, which, though clear as the day, has nevertheleſs been ſo obſcured by endleſs contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, that thouſands of Proteſtants and Papiſts know it in its purity no more.</p>
                  <p>According to the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe axioms, all that go to heaven, give divine <hi>grace</hi> the glory of their ſalvation; becauſe they are all ſaved by mere favour, through the redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt. And according to the <hi>ſecond</hi>
                     <pb n="266" facs="unknown:017930_0261_0FA37DC99B642D30"/>
axiom, all that go to hell, are obliged to clear divine <hi>juſtice,</hi> becauſe they are condemned merely for their avoidable unbelief, and obſtinate diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience. Upon this evangelical plan, the righteous are <hi>graciouſly</hi> rewarded, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous <hi>juſtly</hi> puniſhed: The doctrines of God's <hi>mercy,</hi> in giving grace for Chriſt's ſake, and of man's <hi>faithfulneſs</hi> in uſing it bv Chriſt's help, ſweetly coincide; and from their bleſſed union ſprings the juſt proportion of every part of the goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Theſe axioms are ſo ſtrongly maintained, and ſo frequently alluded to by the ſacred writers, that whoever rejects either the one or the other, might as well reject one half of the bible. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively conſider them aſunder, and your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced reaſon will perceive their <hi>equity.</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially compare them together, and inſtead of finding them incompatible, (as ſome prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed perſons would perſuade us they are) you will ſee, that they <hi>harmonize</hi> in ſo exquiſite a manner, as to anſwer the moſt excellent ends in the world.</p>
                  <p>To give you an idea of their working in the breaſt of believers, permit me to compare them to thoſe two oppoſite, and yet conſentaneous motions of the heart, which anatomiſts call <hi>diaſtole</hi> and <hi>ſyſtole.</hi> The one forcibly dilates, the other powerfully contracts, that noble part of the human body; and both together, by means ſeemingly contrary, cauſe the circulation of the blood, and diffuſe vital powers through all the animal frame. —Juſt ſo paſſive <hi>faith,</hi> and active <hi>love.</hi>—The one perpetually <hi>receives</hi> favours from God, the other perpetually <hi>beſtows</hi> them upon man; and thus, by continually performing their
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:017930_0262_0FA37DCADC755EB0"/>
contrary (not contradictory) offices, they make ſpiritual life circulate through the believer's ſoul, and enable him to diffuſe kindneſs and good works throughout the ſocial body, of which he is a member.</p>
                  <p>From the animal, paſs we to the planetary world; and we ſhall ſee another ſtriking em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of the harmonious oppoſition, which ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts between the two goſpel axioms. There we eminently diſcover the <hi>centripetal</hi> and the <hi>centrifugal</hi> force. Though oppoſed to each other, they are nevertheleſs ſo admirably joined together, that from their exquiſite combination, reſults the harmonious dance of the ſpheres; I mean, the circular motion of the planets around the ſun, and around each other.—Such is the wonderful effect of <hi>evangelical promiſes,</hi> and <hi>legal precepts,</hi> when they meet in a due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion in an upright heart. The <hi>promiſes,</hi> which are all wrapped up in the <hi>firſt</hi> goſpel axiom, powerfully <hi>draw</hi> believers to Chriſt, who is the Sun of Righteouſneſs, and the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Chriſtian ſyſtem: The <hi>precepts,</hi> which the <hi>ſecond</hi> axiom neceſſarily ſuppoſes, drive them forward in the ſtrait line of duty. Being thus delightfully attracted, and powerfully impelled, like planets of a different magnitude, in the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament of the church, believers rapidly move in the orb of evangelical obedience, where the <hi>original</hi> light of Chriſt warmly ſhines into their own ſouls, and their <hi>borrowed</hi> light mildly gleams upon their fellow-mortals.</p>
                  <p>If ever you ſaw a perſon, thus ſwiftly and evenly moving in the immenſe circle of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and ſocial duty; freely receiving all from his God, and freely imparting all to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:017930_0263_0FA37DCAFAA57168"/>
you have ſeen one of the <hi>ſtars in the Lord's right hand</hi>—you have ſeen one, who prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically holds the two goſpel axioms—one, who <hi>believes</hi> as a ſinner, and <hi>works</hi> as a believer—one, in whoſe heart the doctrines of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>works, free grace</hi> and <hi>free obedience, divine faithfulneſs</hi> and <hi>human fidelity,</hi> are juſtly balanced—one, who keeps at an equal diſtance from the dreadful rocks, upon which <hi>Antinomian believers,</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-chriſtian workers,</hi> are daily caſt away—In a word, you have ſeen an adult Chriſtian, a man who <hi>adorns the doctrine of Chriſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in</hi> ALL <hi>things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the two goſpel axioms are of ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, that the health and vigour of every Chriſtian, flow from the proper union of their power in his heart; is it not deplorable to ſee ſo many people every where riſing againſt them? <hi>Self-conceited moraliſts</hi> violently attack the <hi>firſt</hi> axiom; and <hi>ſelf-humbled ſolifidians</hi> will give the <hi>ſecond</hi> no quarter. Thoſe oppoſed aſſailants have all, I grant, a zeal for God, but not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to knowledge; for the <hi>former</hi> know not, that they rob God of <hi>his glory</hi>; and the <hi>latter</hi> do not conſider, that they pour upon him <hi>our ſhame.</hi> The <hi>one</hi> refuſe to acknowledge him the <hi>grand author</hi> of our <hi>bliſs:</hi> The <hi>other,</hi> to mend the matter, repreſent him as the <hi>grand contriver</hi> of our <hi>ruin.</hi> Both, nevertheleſs, have truth on their ſide; but alas! it is only <hi>a part</hi> of the truth as it is in Jeſus; and truth divided, like an animal cut through the middle, is dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully mangled, if not entirely deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>You are alſo deſired to obſerve, judicious reader, that as a juſt proportion of ſail and bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſt, next to a favourable wind, makes a ſhip
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:017930_0264_0FA37DCBBAE23418"/>
ſail with ſpeed and ſafety; ſo the juſt balance of the two goſpel axioms, next to the Spirit of God, makes a believer run ſwiftly and ſafely the race that is ſet before him. He does not properly <hi>run,</hi> he merely <hi>hops</hi> in the way of truth, who, diſcarding one of the goſpel axioms, moves only upon the other. <hi>Antinomian Laodiceans</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and <hi>Anti-chriſtian Phariſees,</hi> are equally blameable. For the piety of the <hi>former</hi> ſtands only upon the <hi>firſt</hi> axiom; and the devotion of the <hi>latter</hi> has no other baſis than the <hi>ſecond.</hi> The <hi>one</hi> will hear of nothing but faith; the <hi>other</hi> will be told of nothing but <hi>works.</hi> But the <hi>ſound</hi> believer is for a <hi>faith</hi> that <hi>works</hi> righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Faith unfeigned,</hi> and <hi>obedient love,</hi> are of equal importance to the true Chriſtian. Thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious graces, which anſwer to the goſpel axioms, like a well proportioned pair of heavenly ſteeds, mutually draw the ſteady chariot of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion acroſs the valleys of diſcouragement, and over the hills of difficulty, which he meets with in his way to heaven. If I might carry on the allegory, I would obſerve, that all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, which the right hand ſteed has over the other, is, that it is <hi>firſt</hi> put in the traces: But this is no proof of his ſuperiority, for he will be taken off at the gate of heaven; and <hi>obedient love</hi> alone, ſhall have the honour of drawing the Chriſtian's triumphal car through the realms of glory.</p>
                  <p>Reader, if in the theory and practice you maintain both goſpel axioms; if, inſtead of ſetting up the one in oppoſition to the other, you ſtand upon the ſcriptural line in which they harmonize; you have ſurmounted the greateſt
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:017930_0265_0FA37DCC8409D428"/>
difficulty there is in the Chriſtian religion; you hold <hi>the faith once delivered unto the ſaints.</hi> And now, prepare to <hi>contend for it:</hi> Arm your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the fight; for <hi>Antinomian believers</hi> will attack you on the <hi>left</hi> hand, and <hi>Phariſaic un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers</hi> on the <hi>right.</hi> But be not afraid of their number; patiently receive their double fire. They may gall one <hi>another,</hi> but they cannot hurt <hi>you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Truth</hi> is great, and <hi>Love</hi> powerful; if you fight under their glorious banners, tho' the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of contempt, and the brands of calumny, will fly thick around you, you ſhall not be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly wounded. Only <hi>take the ſhield of faith,</hi> with this motto, '<hi>By grace I am ſaved through faith</hi>; and <hi>quench with it the fiery darts</hi> of ſelf-conceited legaliſts. <hi>Put on the breaſt-plate of righteouſneſs,</hi> with this inſcription,
<q>Faith works by righteous love, the mother of good works:</q>
This piece of celeſtial armour, will keep off the heavieſt ſtrokes of <hi>ſelf-humbled goſpellers.</hi> And animated by the Captain of your ſalvation, through the oppoſite forces of thoſe adverſaries, urge your evangellically-legal way, till you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change <hi>the ſword of the Spirit</hi> for a <hi>golden harp,</hi> and your daily croſs for an heavenly crown.</p>
                  <p>Such is the happy medium, that the author of this book deſires to recommend. Some time ago, he thought himſelf obliged to oppoſe good miſtaken men, who, in their zeal for the <hi>firſt</hi> goſpel axiom, wanted to repreſent the <hi>ſecond</hi> as a 'dreadful hereſy.' And now he lets theſe papers ſee the light, not only to prove to the free thinkers of his pariſh, that the <hi>firſt</hi> axiom is highly rational; but to convince the enemies of the <hi>ſecond</hi> axiom, that, though he has expoſed
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:017930_0266_0FA37DCD3A42A088"/>
their miſtakes with regard to <hi>works,</hi> he receives the <hi>genuine</hi> doctrines of grace as cordially as they; and is ready ſcripturally, and rationally, to defend ſalvation by <hi>faith,</hi> againſt: the moſt plauſible objections of ſelf-righteous moraliſts.</p>
                  <p>He juſt begs leave to obſerve, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding pages guard the <hi>firſt</hi> goſpel axiom; that the <hi>Four Checks to Antinomianiſm,</hi> guard chiefly the ſecond; that <hi>the Equal Check to Phariſaiſm and Antinomianiſm,</hi> guards both at once; and that thoſe tracts contain a little ſyſtem of prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and polemical divinity, which, it is hoped, ſtands at an equal diſtance from the errors of moral diſbelievers, and immoral believers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This</hi> book is chiefly recommended to diſbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving moraliſts, who deride the doctrine of ſalvation by grace <hi>through faith</hi> in the day of converſion, merely becauſe they are not properly acquainted with our fallen and loſt eſtate. And the <hi>Checks</hi> are chiefly deſigned for diſbelieving Antinomians, who riſe againſt the doctrine of a believer's ſalvation by grace <hi>through</hi> the <hi>works</hi> of faith in the great day, merely becauſe they do not conſider the indiſpenſable neceſſity of evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical obedience, and the nature of the day of judgment.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Appeal,</hi> the careleſs, ſelf-conceited ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is awakened, and humbled. In the <hi>Addreſs,</hi> the ſerious, humbled ſinner, is raiſed up, and comforted. And in the <hi>Checks,</hi> the fooliſh vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin is re-awakened, the Laodicean believer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, the prodigal ſon laſhed back to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's houſe, and the upright believer animated to mend his pace in the way of <hi>faith working by love,</hi> and to <hi>perfect holineſs in the fear of God.</hi>
