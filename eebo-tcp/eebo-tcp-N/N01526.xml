         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>For the Time is come that Judgment must begin at the Houſe of GOD; and if it first Begin at us, what ſhall the End be of them that. Obey not the Goſpel of GOD!

GOD the Father, the Supream Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, the Lord of Providence, and Abſolute Paramount, Sovereign of the Church and World, Viſible and Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. In His Government, His Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of Sovereignty and Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs, Grace and Holineſs, Mercy and Faithfulneſs, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Equity, are gloriouſly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplendent. To ſtrict Juſtice appertain His Commanding, Rewarding &amp; Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, as a Judge Vindictive: To Grace and Mercy belong His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, Rewarding, Puniſhing, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing, and Pardoning as a Father; His Diſpenſations Refer either to the whole World, or to Particular Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Provinces, and Societies, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, or to Individual Perſons. And foraſmuch as the Infliction of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon Multitudes of Sinners of all ſorts, at one and the ſame time or ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; has a Tendency to ſtrike the greater Terrour, and to prevent the more Tranſgreſſion, &amp; to demonſtrate the Lord's moſt impartial hatred of

Ah Lord God! <hi>Who knoweth the Power of thine Anger?</hi> and all the Terrors of the LORD, &amp; of His Fatherly Wrath, which ſometimes is like the Wrath or an Enemy, Who can bear them? This is GOD's Strange Act; &amp; 'tis dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful work indeed: And He doth it, that ſo His Children may be greatly <hi>Afraid of GOD,</hi> (as <hi>David,</hi> when <hi>

Thus 'tis with many Thouſands in the Day of GOD's Anger (who as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks) have yet the Root of the Matter in them, and the Seed of GOD, altho' ſadly buried under the Clods: And many Wiſe Virgins (as in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) are ſo overwhelm'd with their Sick Sleep, as to Lie for Dead, for a Seaſon, and but Few Waking <hi>Noahs</hi> and <hi>Daniels</hi> left in a Nation.</p>

the Means and End are inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and GOD enables us duly to Uſe the Appointed Means, we may moſt certainly Conclude, that He has infallibly Decreed the End.

               <p>USE III.

Wherefore with ſubmiſſion to, and in Proſecution of that Decree, Let us make our humble Addreſſes, that the <hi>LORD will not ſuffer the Rod of the Wicked to lie very long on the Lot of the Righteous, to compel them to put forth their Hands to Iniquity.</hi> Pſal. 125.3. <hi>Nor will Himſelf be ſorely An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with 'em from Generation to Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Pſal. 85.4, 15.

What Evangelical Preachers were the Holy Prophets, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah?</hi> And what fearful Perdition was the

Portion of Diſobedient Reprobates in their Days? <hi>Jer.</hi> 42.22. And how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Thouſands of the Goſpel-Deſpiſing <hi>Jews</hi> afterwards were diſpatch'd into an horrendous Eternity, in a Time of Judgment, in the Reign of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Veſpaſian?</hi> When GOD lays Judgment to the Line, and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Plummet, and His own People Eſcape not fore Puniſhment; all the moſt flouriſhing Pretences of the Wicked to Hope of Eſcape, are Vain.</p>
               <p>Their Uſual Pretences are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Infinite Mercy of GOD. But GOD may be (and is) of an Infinitely Merciful Nature, and <hi>yet not be Merciful to Wicked Tranſgreſſors:</hi> Pſal. 59.5. <hi>He that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them, will ſhew them no favour; Iſai.</hi> 27.11. Almighty GOD is as Infinite in Juſtice, as in Mercy: and Incorrigible Sinners are fit Objects for His Juſtice to be Glorify'd upon, and no longer for His Mercy &amp; Patience to be abuſed
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:001812_0047_0FB83F2A4DA539A0"/>
by 'em: To what Purpoſe is it to waſte any more Time upon them, who are already as Stubble fully dry, fit fewel for Unquenchable Fire? They obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately perſevere in <hi>their Rejection of</hi> CHRIST, and of the Mercy of GOD in HIM, freely offered to 'em, ſo that they can lay no Claim to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Mercy, on CHRIST's account; and it's impoſſible they ſhould have it otherwiſe: Now if thoſe who are in CHRIST JESUS, and lay Claim to the Mercy of GOD by Faith, &amp; have a good Title to it, yet Eſcape not ſore Temporal Puniſhments for their Sins, much leſs can Chriſtleſs Sinners ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to Eſcape. Surely GOD will Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject their Plea for Mercy, who obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately &amp; incorrigibly Reject CHRIST and Mercy. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24.31.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another of their uſual Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is, that they will Repent of their Sins, and Believe in CHRIST JESUS afterwards: But,</p>

it is utterly to be deſpaired of; the Malignity of their Wills appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be Inſuperable and Incurable by all Means: After ſo many years Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering and Hardning, it's impoſſible that of <hi>Themſelves</hi> they ſhould Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to Life and Fruitfulneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>From the Lord they have no hope</hi>: For when the Time of Deſtroying Judgment is Come, it's too late for ſuch as have out-ſtood their whole Day of Grace, to expect His Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. GOD is weary of Waiting, and <hi>HIS SPIRIT will no longer strive with them.</hi> Gen. 6.3. <hi>Their Iniquity is full?</hi> The Set Time for Offers of Mercy is Ended: <hi>The LORD being Angry, is riſen up, and has ſhut the Door, they being without:</hi> Luk. 13.25. Mercy has had its long Days, and now Juſtice and Fury muſt have Theirs; The Days that are now Come upon 'em, are not Days of Patience, but Days of Vengeance; they have no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, no Ground to flatter themſelves with Expectation that GOD will give
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:001812_0049_0FB83F2E39F65D18"/>
'em the Faith and Repentance which they hate, and are continually doing all they can to harden themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt. They therefore will act ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Irrationally, if they Promiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves an Eſcape from Deſtruction.</p>
               <p>USE. Have the Wicked no Juſt Pretences to Hope for Eſcape from Deſtruction, and horrendous Ruine, when the Day of God's Patience is Ended? And ſhall it be eaſier for <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> in the Judgment, than for the Rejecters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and for Rebels againſt the Light? And will it be e're long too late to ſeek for Peace with God? I ſay too late, when the Day of Grace is Ended! Let them then be Convinced, that 'tis moſt Reaſonable, and account it their wiſdom, duty, and intereſt, that they take the Preſent Time, to ſeek Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very from their Wicked and Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Eſtate; Not Delaying a Day lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; Not daring to put off this moſt Important Work, till afterwards.

            <p>This <hi>Roman Catholick Church</hi> (as it Calls it ſelf) is a Myſtical <hi>Babylon</hi> for Idolatry, Sorcery, and Univerſal Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; and a <hi>Sodom</hi> for Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and <hi>Egypt</hi> for Cruelty and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.8.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Among Modern Authors, Mr. <hi>Junieu</hi> and Mr. <hi>Petto</hi> are of the Opinion, that the Vials are Poured out before the Witneſſes Reſurrection, and that the Seventh Hour Glaſs is at its laſt Sand then.</p>

            <p>WITH their Sophiſtries, and Signs, and Lying Wonders, and Diabolical Miracles, they would deceive (if it were Poſſible,) the <hi>Elect</hi> themſelves; but GOD's Decree and Promiſe have made it Impoſſible that they ſhould to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, finally deceive <hi>Them,</hi> and utterly Cheat and Strip 'em of their Saving Garments.</p>

            <p>As for Thoſe that Complain, It's too much for 'em to be ſo Strict and Holy as they ſee ſome Saints to be, and that to be ever taking heed to themſelves and watching of their Hearts and Ways is Unattainable; thereupon Contenting themſelves to live at a looſe End; They Speak and Act as Becomes not Chriſtians, to whom the Evangelical Command is Poſſible, and who can (in a degree) <hi>do all Things thro'</hi> CHRIST <hi>ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</hi> Phil. 4.13.</p>
            <p>You perhaps have long been <hi>Accoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed not to Watch</hi>; But <hi>One Cuſtome</hi> may be Remov'd and Taken away (tho it be a Second Nature) By the Bringing in of <hi>Another Cuſtome</hi>; and Acts often Multiply'd, make a Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome. <hi>Suidas</hi> Relates concerning the Watchful <hi>Marcellus,</hi> that by long Uſe
