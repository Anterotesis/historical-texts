            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>SO Moſes the ſervant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab—And the children of Iſrael wept for Moſes in the plains of Moab thirty days—And there aroſe not a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſince in Iſrael like unto Moſes.</p>

               </gap> of the Sanctuary, that it has not been my cuſtom; nor do I approve of the practice of introducing political ſubjects in the houſe of God, on the Lord's Day: when ſubjects of ſupreme and divine importance may be furniſhed, for greater edification to the immortal mind. Nor do I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to introduce them upon this occaſion, farther than their connexion, with the character of a great and good man, may require.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:039139_0004_1013EB92D700EE68"/>SHOULD I be entirely ſilent at this time, I might, and perhaps juſtly, be conſidered inſenſible of the obligations, which we owe one to another, wanting in reſpect to a great and illuſtrious character, and ungrateful to the Governor of the Univerſe, who alone raiſes up ſaviours and deliverers for his people.</p>
            <p>THEN let me drop a tear, grateful to the memory of the man, who was favored of his God, and honorable in the ſight of all the people; tho it be loſt among the tears of thouſands, whoſe hearts may be touched, with more pungent ſorrow.</p>
            <p>THE world, my Brethren, hath in every age, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced characters celebrated by fame: Conquerors, Tyrants, Philoſophers or Lawgivers. But how rarely have the characters of the humane conqueror, a humble lawgiver, a ſubmiſſive citizen, and a meek and humble chriſtian been united in one man. When Tyrants fall, they are to be pityed, when wiſe Legiſlators, they are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretted: But when men of this excellent combination of character, we, like the children of Iſrael, ſhould weep, or like the devout men who carried Stephen to his buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, make great lamentation over him.</p>
            <p>THE character now deſcribed, and the duty to be practiſed, at the departure of ſuch a man, if not fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the paſſage under conſideration, may be farther illuſtrated under the following particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">I. THE character of Moſes as hereafter expreſſed, "And there aroſe not a prophet ſince in Iſrael like unto Moſes."</p>
            <p n="2">II. THAT human greatneſs and excellency afford no exemption from Death.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:039139_0005_1013EB946ADD82C0"/>III. THE duty of a people when characters eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſeful are removed.</p>
            <p>IN purſuance of this plan we are in the</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt place, To conſider the Character of Moſes. Here we may obſerve, many important circumſtances coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to render it truly illuſtrious. Poſſeſſed naturally of a ſound penetrating mind, the foundation, and juſt prelude of his future greatneſs. Brought up in an empire, where the arts and ſciences, then known, flouriſhed to a great degree of perfection; and indulged with all the privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and advantages, which, ſuch a high ſtate of national improvement, could afford. And, whatever might be the ſyſtem or principles, by which, the nation was gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erned, Moſes muſt have been acquainted with them all. To which may be added, an opportunity of acquiring all the embelliſhments of the Egyptian Court.</p>
            <p>THIS high ſtate of refinement, in addition to his meek and placid temper, was, but truly, calculated to teach his heart to feel another's woe. To animate his ſoul with ſtrong deſires to be the deliverer of his brethren, from the Egyptian yoke.</p>
            <p>NOW ſuffer me, for a moment, to lead your minds to conſider the ſtate of God's covenant people.—From the days of Joſeph, God's people Iſrael, gradually, ſunk into a ſtate of ſlavery.—Having preſerved themſelves a diſtinct people, living within the juriſdiction of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian Court, and, under the bleſſing of divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, becoming very numerous; the jealouſy of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious haughty nation was eaſily excited.—Pride, the foſter parent of luxury and extravagance, deſires un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful means for its gratifications, and often leads to cruelty and oppreſſion. The moſt ſuitable means, now to be deviſed, for its gratification, and the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:039139_0006_1013EB9693938538"/>
ſubjection of this infant nation, were, to lay them under contribution. And to augment that tribute from time to time, till they ſhould become complete ſlaves and vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals. —But, however this might enrich her coffers, as it proved inſufficient to check the progreſs of their growing numbers, recourſe muſt be had to murder and deſtruction. —Thus reduced to the greateſt diſtreſs and poverty, the ſituation of the houſe of Iſrael was truly helpleſs, defence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and forlorn.</p>
            <p>AT this critical moment, God raiſed up a deliverer for his people.</p>
            <p>HERE let us admire the power and wiſdom of that God, under the ſuperintendency of whoſe providence all things ſubſiſt; who alike feeds the oppreſſor and the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed: Yet aſſuredly, ſees the affliction of his people, hears the cries of the oppreſſed, and comes down to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them from their enemies with a mighty hand and with a ſtretched out arm.—Nor are the inſtruments which he raiſes up and uſes for affecting the great purpoſe of his providental Government, leſs worthy, honorable or deſerving, for having received their power and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from God.</p>
            <p>THO' the miraculous power of God wonderfully inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, yet the firmneſs and intrepidity of Moſes was highly expreſſed in his conduct at the Egyptian Court. The imperiouſneſs and power of the Egyptians, the pov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, fears and prejudices of the Iſraelites, were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, contributing equally to evince his valour and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. —I need not particularize the inſtances of his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and valour, at the Red ſea, at the conqueſt of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lek, at Sinai, at Taberah, at Zin and Median.</p>
            <p>NOR was his character leſs conſpicuous as a <hi>legiſlator,</hi> than a leader of the hoſt. No ſooner had he brought the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:039139_0007_1013EB98E5BAE3C8"/>
people through the red ſea, and placed them in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſafety, than he became intent upon the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of juſtice. By the advice of Jethro his father in-law, he eſtabliſhed a civil government, that juſtice might be more perfectly adminiſtered, long and deſervedly held in high eſteem. The method apparently met the divine approbation. Very ſoon, <hi>the Governor of the Univerſe</hi> called Moſes to the top of Sinai, and committed to him <hi>that perfect code of moral precepts,</hi> which he afterwards delivered to the children of Iſrael. Theſe, <hi>the great pole Star of Legiſlation,</hi> are of equal importance to direct the due execution of juſt and equitable laws, by proper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted authorities. Moſes was the head of Legiſlative and Executive authorities, and from this period was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged with the moſt ſenſible and moſt frequent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications from the Divine preſence. Whom, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſacred hiſtorian, <hi>the</hi> LORD <hi>knew face to face.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHILE <hi>Legiſlative</hi> and <hi>Military talents</hi> made him fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, <hi>meekneſs</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtian graces</hi> rendered him ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. However, in theſe and many others, he might be a type of the great CAPTAIN <hi>of our ſalvation,</hi> yet his character as a man was truly deſerving.</p>
            <p>THOUGH God raiſed up <hi>Joſhuas</hi> to lead his hoſts, and <hi>Samuels</hi> to judge his people, yet in no character have theſe talents been ſo agreeably united, <hi>for there aroſe not a prophet ſince in Iſrael like unto Moſes.</hi>

            <p>AND notwithſtanding ſuch a combination of the moſt excellent talents, as rarely centre in one man, yet they afford him no ſhield from calumny, nor ſhelter from the reproaches of an ungrateful rebellious people. That people often ſinned againſt God, in murmuring againſt Moſes, at the <hi>red ſea,</hi> in the <hi>wilderneſs,</hi> at <hi>Sinai</hi> and the water of <hi>Meribah.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:039139_0008_1013EB9C31060C80"/>NOR are ſuch talents a ſufficient ſecurity againſt ſin. Even <hi>Moſes,</hi> after he had carried the children of Iſrael through the wilderneſs, with much patience and tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſinned againſt God at the waters of <hi>Meribah kadeſh.</hi> But the Lord forgave him his ſin. Notwithſtanding he ſaid, thou ſhalt ſee with thine eye, but ſhalt not paſs over this Jordan, into the good land, whether the children of Iſarel go to poſſeſs it. Therefore <hi>get thee up into this moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Abarim, into mount Nebo; and die in the mount whether thou goeſt up, and be gathered to thy people.</hi> Which leads us to conſider in the</p>
            <p n="2">2nd. place, THAT human greatneſs and excellency afford no exemption from death.</p>
            <p>IF a ſingle teſtimony could eſtabliſh a truth, this had been ſufficient. But we are not reduced to the neceſſity of relying on a ſingle teſtimony. Our Fathers where are they, and the Prophets do they live forever? Death hath paſſed upon all men,—for death hath reigned from Adam until Moſes—and from Moſes until now.— Death ſtalks, alike unconcerned, over the Prince upon the throne, and the peaſant in the cottage. Oh! thou relent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs tyrant, wilt thou never be ſatisfied? Can no ties of nature or affection move you? Shall not the love, nay, I had almoſt ſaid the adoration of millions make thee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent? —Wilt thou pay no reſpect to the higheſt talents— to the greateſt achievments—to the moſt eſſential ſervices rendered to the world, nor to thoſe chriſtian graces which advance men near to the perfection of Angels? No!— no!—But rather like the envious fair, who eagerly deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries, and crops the fineſt flower!—</p>
            <p>Will there never be an end?—O yes! my heart exults! That holy one, who led captivity captive, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived gifts for men, ſhall diſarm thee of all thy terrors,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:039139_0009_1013EB9ECE740708"/>
and diſpoil thee of all thy powers, for the laſt enemy which ſhall be conquered is Death. But in the mean time there is a ſuitable and proper temper to be exerciſed by the people of God. Which will lead me in the</p>
            <p n="3">3d place, To conſider the duty of a people when characters eminently uſeful are removed.—</p>
            <p>THIS is expreſſed in the ſecond paragraph in the text. <hi>"And the children of Iſrael wept for Moſes in the plain of Moab, thirty days."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MANY and various methods have been adopted to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs ſorrow. By external deportment, ſadneſs of the countenance, forms of dreſs, mournful ſounds, and bitter lamentations. But none appear to be ſo natural, ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al or ſincere as that of weaping. It is not certain, that every heart which is ſincerely affected can expreſs its ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row by a flowing tear. The heart may be ſo ſwelled with ſorrow, as entirely to forbid the tear to flow. When, to give aloof to tears, would afford great relief to a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened ſoul. But men can rarely weep, except the heart is ſenſibly impreſſed. Hence it is conſidered as carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with it the higheſt evidence of ſincere ſorrow. That the grief of the children of Iſrael, at the removal of ſo great and amiable a character as Moſes, was ſincere, is hardly to be doubted. And we have ſtill farther evidence of its ſincerity, by its univerſality. It was not a few of the Elders of Iſrael, of the family connexions, or more intimate acquaintance and relations, who were affected by this diſpenſation, but the whole houſe and family of Iſrael. This was farther expreſſed by the long period which they devoted to ſorrow and woe. However many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances may be recorded in the Jewiſh Hiſtory of long periods of ſorrow and weeping, yet few, if any, have exceeded the preſent account; and few which have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:039139_0010_1013EBA0AFCEC8E8"/>
greater evidence of its propriety and ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>DEATH, as the conſequence of ſin, hath given juſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of great ſorrow. That ſorrow, upon ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, is a dictate of nature, is founded on experience. That it is a duty is made plain, by a train of divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and precepts. And that it is conſiſtent with the moſt lively oracles of our holy religion, appears, from the illuſtrious comment which it received, from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> at the Grave of Lazarus. Still my Brethren, this ſorrow ſhould bear ſome proportion to the magnitude of its exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cauſe. When Individuals die, <hi>friends, relatives</hi> and <hi>neighbours</hi> may weep. But when <hi>great</hi> &amp; <hi>illuſtrious Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters</hi> fall, the <hi>fathers</hi> of the people, it becomes a <hi>whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to put on garbs of the deepeſt humiliation.</p>
            <p>I TRUST by this time, my hearers have formed ſome juſt idea of the improvement, I deſign to make of the preſent ſubject—</p>
            <p>INDEED my Brethren, in many reſpects, our ſituation is not diſſimilar from the children of Iſrael. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed a <hi>Moſes,</hi> we a WASHINGTON. A character, than whoſe, none can be more deſervedly eſteemed, nor any ought, more ſincerely to be loved. Since the days of Moſes, there hath not a character ariſen, to grace the page of Hiſtory, more unſullied, or, who hath a juſter claim to honor and renown. A ſecond Moſes raiſed up of God, to be a deliverer of this American Iſrael.</p>
            <p>MANY of you, on painful recollection, can remember, when your liberties were in danger. When you were oppreſſed by a great and powerful nation. A nation ſkilled in arts and wars: Who ſat Miſtreſs of the ſeas, and governed nations with a nod. A nation, whom ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:039139_0011_1013D685B3B50B98"/>
had rendered lofty and imperious, and whom pride and haughtineſs had made as liſtleſs to your entreaties, as the Egyptians to the miracles of Moſes.</p>
            <p>NOR can you fail to recollect the ſtate of this infant nation. How weak, how defenceleſs? How unſkilled in warlike atchievments? How helpleſs in the ſight of the nations? Without were fightings, within were fears. This was our ſituation, when the <hi>Lord</hi> raiſed up a <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> for the hoſt, added <hi>ſtrength</hi> to his <hi>Courage, wiſdom</hi> to his <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and <hi>prowreſs</hi> to his <hi>wiſdom.</hi> Made him a deliverer of his people. Repeated ſucceſſes, and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable praiſes which would have elated the heart of any other man, ſeemed only calculated to teach him hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and dependence on God. Such was the human<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and benevolence of this conqueror, as to put to ſilence the tongue of malice and envy.</p>
            <p>NO ſooner, under the providence of God, was the <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>Independence</hi> of this nation ſecured, than the eyes of all the people were upon him. By their united voice, he entered the Cabinet, with as much dignity, as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired from the field. There for years he held the reins of riſing empire. Altho, there he diſplayed talents which have aſtoniſhed the world, yet it could not be expected, but ſome, who were prejudiced in favor of the <hi>leeks</hi> and <hi>Onions</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> or ſtrongly attached to the <hi>idolatries</hi> of <hi>Canaan,</hi> would inſtigate a rebellion againſt him.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER God may raiſe up in his ſucceſſors, Joſhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as to lead the hoſt and Judges to rule the people; Yet they never can, under exiſting circumſtances, nor ought they ever to expect, to arrive, at that degree of unſullied univerſal fame with their predeceſſor.</p>
            <p>EVEN here, I know not whether moſt to admire, that
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:039139_0012_1013EBA70ADFDFE0"/>
train of ſhining talents expreſſed in the cabinet and field, or the dignity with which he retired from riſing empire to private life. In this, he leaves on long record, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample without precedent for the great. The eaſtern world may boaſt of an Alexander, Ceazar, Pompey, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon or Lycurgus, but where is the man, in the meredian of life, on the ſummit of human greatneſs, at the head of empire; who freely did reſign the reins of ſtate, and retire with pleaſure to the humble ſtation of a private cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izen. In ſubmitting himſelf to thoſe laws, whoſe ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature had rendered valid, he exhibited the moſt unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable evidence of his own integrity. He manifeſted himſelf a faithful imitator of his Lord and Maſter; in being willing to be governed by thoſe laws which he had framed for his people.</p>
            <p>FAIR Virtue ſhone—in this bleſſed retreat—to crown his name—But here alas! the joyful theme muſt end.</p>
            <p>DISEASE was ſhort, and his flight was rapid, leſt the united prayer of Millions had prevailed, e're his fleeting ſpirit had reached the world of bliſs. Methinks he ſound all heaven in joy, but left the world in tears.</p>
            <p>NOW boaſt thou Tyrant of thy ſuperior conqueſt, for thou haſt no more WASHINGTONS to conquer. Or rather ſay, his truſt in God, diſarm'd thee of thy ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and reſignation to the King of Saints, deprived thee of a conqueſt.</p>
            <p>'TIS all the ſame to us, we mourn him dead. How happy when our duty and inclination coincide. Your ſolem garbs beſpeak a heart of ſorrow.<note n="*" place="bottom">The Houſe of God was dreſſed in deep mourning.

Theſe inſpire our hoſts with fortitude and courage, for the moſt daring enterprizes: and fill our enemies with terror and diſmay. Theſe change the counſel of Ahithophel into fooliſhneſs.

Will make our <hi>Senators wiſdom</hi> and our <hi>exactors</hi> righteouſneſs. Will ſtill tumults, ſettle diviſions, heal animoſities, and make us an humble obedient and happy people.</p>
            <p>MAY he, who is the choſen head of this people, while he ſtands gazing at the aſcent of his predeceſſor, catch the falling mantle, and be diſpoſed to rule this people in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him, <hi>by whom Kings reign and princes decree juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MAY he alſo, who is raiſed up to be the <hi>Joſhua</hi> of our hoſts, who hath accompanied our Moſes thro' the trials of the wilderneſs, have the preſence of that God, before whom the walls of Jericho were laid proſtrate, and the waters of Jordan were drawn backward. And may that God, who hath hitherto compaſſed us with favor as with a ſhield, again fill our hearts with joy and gladneſs, <hi>through him that hath loved us and given himſelf to die for us.</hi>

            <head>AN APPENDIX, Giving a particular account of the behaviour of Gen. WASHINGTON, during his diſtreſſing illneſs, &amp;c. by two of his Phyſicians.</head>

            <p>SOME time in the night of Friday the 13th inſt. hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been expoſed to a rain on the preceding day, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral WASHINGTON was attacked with an inflammatory affection of the upper part of the windpipe, called in the technical language <hi>Cynache Trachealis.</hi> The diſeaſe commenced with a violent ague, accompanied with ſome pain in the upper and fore part of the throat, a ſenſe of ſtricture in the ſame part, a cough, and a difficult, rather than a painful deglutition, which were ſoon ſucceeded by a fever, and a quick and laborious reſpiration. The neceſſity of bloodletting ſuggeſting itſelf to the General, he procured a bleeder in the neighbourhood, who took from his arm in the night 12 or 14 ounces of blood. He could not by any means be prevailed on by the family to ſend for the attending phyſician till the following morning, who arrived at Mount-Vernon at about 11 o'clock on Saturday. Diſcovering the caſe to be highly
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:039139_0015_1013EBAD660CFB68"/>
alarming, and foreſeeing the fatal tendency of the diſeaſe, two conſulting phyſicions were immediately ſent for, who arrived, one at half after three, and the other at four o'clock in the afternoon: in the mean time were employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two pretty copious bleedings, a bliſter was applied to the part affected, two moderate doſes of calomel were given, and an injection was adminiſtered, which operated on the lower inteſtines, but all without any perceptible advantage, the reſpiration becoming ſtill more difficult and diſtreſſing. Upon the arrival of the firſt of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting phyſicians, it was agreed, as there were yet no ſigns of accumulation in the bronchial veſſels of the lungs, to try the reſult of another bleeding, when about 32 ounces of blood were drawn, without the ſmalleſt apparent alleviation of the diſeaſe. Vapours of vinegar and water were frequently inhaled, ten grains of calomel were given, ſucceeded by repeated doſes of emetic tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, amounting in all to 5 or 6 grains, with no other effect than a copious diſcharge from the bowels. The power of life ſeemed now manifeſtly yielding to the force of the diſorder; bliſters were applied to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, together with a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of bran and vinegar to the throat. Speaking, which was painful from the beginning, now became almoſt impracticable; reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion grew more and more contracted and imperfect, till at half after eleven on Saturday night, retaining the full poſſeſſion of his intellects—when he expired without a ſtruggle.</p>
            <p>HE was fully impreſſed at the beginning of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, as well as through every ſucceeding ſtage of it, that its concluſion would be mortal; ſubmitting to the ſeveral exertions made for his recovery, rather as a duty, than from any expectations of their efficacy. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the operations of death upon his ſyſtem as coeval
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:039139_0016_1013EBB0A15518A8"/>
with the diſeaſe; and ſeveral hours his before death, after repeated efforts to be underſtood, ſucceeded in expreſſing a deſire that he might be permitted to die without further interruption.</p>
            <p>DURING the ſhort period of his illneſs, he oeconomiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his time, in the arrangement of ſuch few concerns as required his attention, with the utmoſt ſerenity; and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated his approaching diſſolution with every demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of that equanimity for which his whole life has been ſo uniformly and ſingularly conſpicuous.</p>
