            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

And he took them into his Arms, put his Hands upon them, and bleſſed them,</hi> Mark <hi>10.13.—16.</hi> Now this Action of our Saviour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates that ſome Children are bleſſed, and that with ſpiritual Bleſſings in heavenly Things, being the Heirs of the Kingdom of God. And no doubt the <hi>Infant-Seed</hi> of <hi>Believers</hi> make no ſmall Part of the Kingdom of Glory. Yea, there have been ſome <hi>little Ones</hi> in whom have been found remarkable Signs of an extraordinary Converſion: Such Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations

of a ſaving Knowledge of God, and of Chriſt, as gave abundant Reaſon to hope they were taught of God; the Power of God's Grace being magnified in the natural Infirmities of their Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Child,</hi> who is the Subject of the enſuing <hi>Narrative,</hi> (drawn up by another Hand, and well atteſted;) is juſtly reckon'd One of this happy Number. Her Behaviour in her Sickneſs was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove her Years. And her dying Speeches ſeem'd plainly to ſhew that the Favour of God in Chriſt, was in her Eſteem better than Life. May God ſupport her pious <hi>Mother</hi> under her great Languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Pains, with the joyful Hope of going to this deſireable Child; but more eſpecially of being <hi>preſent with the Lord,</hi> when ſhe ſhall be <hi>abſent from the Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, Let us <hi>praiſe</hi> our glorious Lord, who gives ſuch Grace unto Children, and ordains Strength out of their Mouths.</p>
            <p>Let <hi>godly Parents</hi> be excited and encouraged to come to the Throne of Grace, to aſk Grace for their Children. Bleſſed be God! The Infant-Seed of Believers, are not Aliens from the Common-Wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> nor Strangers to the Covenant of Promiſe. <hi>No, The Promiſe is to you, and to your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> God's Promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> before the giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Law, was, That <hi>He would be a God to him, and to his Seed after him,</hi> Gen. <hi>17.7.</hi> And the Word of God aſſureth us, that the <hi>Bleſſing of Abraham is come upon the believing Gentiles,</hi> Gal. <hi>3.13, 14, 16.</hi> What an Encouragement is here given to our Faith, in praying for our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren! What an Obligation is here laid upon us, to
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:005008_0004_100E5C8863CCB028"/>
give up our Children unto God in <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and then to bring them up in the <hi>Nurture and Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of the Lord!</hi> The more diligent and faithful we are in anſwering our Covenant Engagements, the more Comfort ſhall we probably enjoy in our Children while they live, and the more Hope ſhall we have in their Death, if it pleaſeth God to take them from us in their Childhood.</p>
            <p>Let <hi>Children</hi> alſo be affected and mov'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after the God of their Fathers, and to ſeek him early. Cry to him, <hi>My Father, Thou art the Guide of my Youth.</hi> Offer up your firſt ripe Fruits unto God. Begin in the Morning of your Days to ſerve him who is the Lord of all your Time. You are ſtrongly oblig'd to this, not only as God is your Creator, but alſo as you are his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by a Covenant Relation. When you were baptized, God's Name was called upon you, and you were devoted to his Service. Do not then alienate yourſelves from him; but glorify him with your Souls and Bodies which are his. Prize this great Privilege of being born under the Shadow of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; but take heed leſt you be carnally confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and ſecure. Know it, if your Lives are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Unclean, you ſhall be caſt into outer Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, tho' you are the Children of the (viſible) Kingdom. Be earneſt with God therefore to give you that inviſible Grace which is repreſented by Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> This divine Ordinance teacheth you, That by Nature you are defiled, being <hi>ſhapen in Iniquity and conceiv'd in Sin.</hi> Seek to God then to waſh you thoroughly from your Iniquity, and to cleanſe you from your Sin, by pouring out his holy Spirit upon you, and ſo applying the Blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:005008_0005_100E5C670A68F290"/>
to your Souls. In a Word, labour to know the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures from your Childhood, learn your Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm, pray to God, keep the Sabbath holy, be du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful to your Parents, fly the Sins of Pride, Idleneſs, Uncleanneſs, Lying, Calling wicked Names, and all other youthful Luſts; and follow the Things that are pure and lovely and of good Report.</p>
            <p>Now, That you may be animated and encouraged to make haſte to keep God's Commandments, by the exemplary Inſtance of early Piety ſet before you in the following Pages, I do in an eſpecial Manner commend this <hi>little Book</hi> to your attentive Reading, and you to the <hi>Bleſſing</hi> of that God who teacheth us to profit, beſeeching him to fulfill that gracious Promiſe in you, Iſa. <hi>54.13. And all thy Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhall be taught of the Lord, and great ſhall be the Peace of thy Children.</hi>

Then ſhe began to inquire concerning God, and the Nature and Affairs of her Soul, and ſhe ſaid, ſhe was afraid ſhe had not lived up to that End for which ſhe was made. She was asked, What was the End ſhe was made for? The Child anſwered, — To glorify God: But I am afraid I have not lived to the Glory of God, as I ſhould have done. She was told, That ſhe muſt pray to God, that he would be pleaſed to pardon her Sins, and give her Grace to ſerve and glorify him.</p>

                  </gap> her ſelf with ſuch wonderful Patience as that all that came near admir'd. She wou'd often put up that Requeſt, <q>Heavenly Father,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005008_0009_100E5C6C5B603D60"/>
Give me thy Chriſt, give me thy Grace, and pardon all my Sins, for Jeſus Chriſt's ſake, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</q> Then ſhe ſaid, What is Sanctification? And made Anſwer to herſelf, <q>It is the Work of God's free Grace.—What are the Benefits which in this Life do accompany or flow from Juſtification, Adoption, and Sanctification? They are, Aſſurance of God's Love, Peace of Conſcience, Joy in the Holy Ghoſt, Increaſe of Grace, and Perſeverance therein to the End.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Being aſk'd, if ſhe was willing to die, and go to Chriſt; ſhe ſaid Yes: But Child you know you are a Sinner; ſhe ſaid, Yes: And you know where the Wicked go when they die; ſhe ſaid, Yes, they are caſt into Hell: And being aſk'd if ſhe was not afraid of going thither; ſhe ſaid, No, For Chriſt is an all-ſufficient Saviour, and he is able to ſave me, and I hope he will: Tho' I have not yet ſeen Chriſt, yet I hope I ſhall ſee him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A while after ſhe ſaid, I am weary of this World, and long to be gone: O when ſhall I go, O when ſhall I go! Her Mother aſked her, if ſhe was willing to leave her alone? She anſwer'd, Yes, For when you die, I hope you will go to Heaven too.</p>
               <p n="4">4. She feeling an Alteration in herſelf, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd her Mother to ſend for Mr. SEWALL, and when he came, he asked her how ſhe did; ſhe anſwered, Very weak: He aſked her if ſhe was willing to die? She ſaid, Yes: He ſaid, Do you know that you are a Sinner? She ſaid, Yes: He aſk'd her, if ſhe had not heard that there was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother and a better World than this? She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005008_0010_100E5C915AD53F58"/>
Yes. He aſk'd her ſeveral other Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but they ſlipt my Memory. He was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to aſk her one Queſtion, but ſaid it was a great one to ask a Child, but however he would, and ſaid to her, Child, are you willing humbly to ſubmit to the Will of God, either for Life or Death? She ſaid, Yes.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A while after ſhe was weeping, and being aſked the Reaſon, ſhe ſaid, <q>I tho't I ſaw the Flames of Hell, and was going there, but I tho't I ſaw Chriſt, and he called me to come to him, and then I was not afraid; and I have cried to God for Grace to ſerve him.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. A while after ſhe was taken with Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion Fits, and lay ſeveral Hours, all Hopes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery being taken away: But ſhe reviving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, her Pain returned with greater Violence: She prayed to God to take her away out of this miſerable World, and cried, —<q>O God, my God, If thou wilt pleaſe to take me away, I will be willing to bear what Pain thou ſhalt pleaſe to lay upon me: O God, my dear God, I love thee dearly!</q> And this ſhe repeated ſeveral Times over.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Her Mother ſitting by her weeping, the Child ſaid, Dear Mother, you make me have more Pain: Her Mother ſaid, No, my dear Child, I don't: She ſaid, Yes, you cry, and that troubles me, and cauſes me to have more Pain.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Mr. SEWALL being ſent for again, he ſaid, Child, Is it not better to be in Heaven with God and Chriſt, than to be here? She anſwered, Yes, Yes. He aſk'd her if he ſhould pray to God that he would be pleas'd to take her to himſelf?
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005008_0011_100E5C6E90EB2570"/>
She made a quick Reply, doubling her Words, Yes, Yes. He asked her another Queſtion, but being in great Trouble, it ſlipt my Memory: But the Child made no Anſwer to it, and only ſaid, I am ſpent.</p>
               <p n="9">9. A few Hours after, her Pains abating a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the Fits returned with more Violence than before, and held her for ſeveral Hours, and then left her. She lay for ſome Days ſo ſenſeleſs that ſhe knew not thoſe that came to ſee her. But it pleaſed God to reſtore her again to her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Health: And before ſhe was able to ſit up, ſhe wou'd call for her Book, and lay and read by the Hour together.</p>

                  <hi>The III. SECTION.</hi> Containing a brief Account of her, from her firſt remarkable Illneſs in the Fall and Winter, <hi>1716,</hi> to her ſecond, in <hi>April, 1718.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>HE had by Courſe read almoſt thro' the Old Teſtament; but at other Times her Delight was to read in the New, concerning the Birth of Chriſt, and his Sufferings; and would aſk the Meaning of what ſhe read.</p>
               <p n="2">2. One Day as ſhe ſat by herſelf reading the 7th of the Revelations, concerning the Number of them that were ſealed; when ſhe came to the 9th Verſe, ſhe was overheard to weep 'till ſhe came to the End of the Chapter.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="7" facs="unknown:005008_0012_100E280D286D5D80"/>3. One Morning as ſhe lay in her Bed, ſhe aſked, What was meant by the Fountain, and the Houſe of David, and the Inhabitants of Jeruſalem, in Zech. 13.1.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hearing a Sermon from <hi>Luke</hi> 15. concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Prodigal Son; a few Days after, ſhe was ſaying the Text over to herſelf; ſhe then aſk'd, Who was meant by the Father; and who by the Son?</p>
               <p n="5">5. She had begun to learn the Proofs of the Aſſemblies Catechiſm; and when ſhe came to that in, 1 Joh. 5.7. She aſked, If the Father was God, and if the Son was God alſo, and if the Holy Ghoſt was God alſo? For it is ſaid here, That there are Three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe Three are One: And this ſeems as if there were Three Gods, and yet three is but One. And ſhe deſired to be told ſomething of this Myſtery. She was told, There was but one GOD, tho' there were Three Perſons in the Godhead. That Chriſt was the Eternal Son of God, and the ſame in Subſtance and equal with the Father in Power and Glory, and was God. Then ſaid the Child, Tho' Chriſt be the Son of God, yet is He God alſo? Anſwer was made her, Yes: and the Holy Ghoſt was the Spirit of God, and proceeded both from the Father and the Son, and was the ſame in Subſtance with them both, and was equal in Power and Glory. And a while after ſhe aſked. If Chriſt took upon him the Nature of a Man? She was told that he did.</p>
               <p n="6">6. She rejoiced greatly when the Lord's Day came, eſpecially if it were fair Weather for her
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005008_0013_100E5C7279E54230"/>
to go to the Publick Worſhip of God. And when ſhe came Home, ſhe would take a Book, and ſit and read, till it was time to go to the Afternoon Exerciſe, without the leaſt ſign of Wearineſs. And if ſhe was detained at Home on the Sabbath; ſhe would not ſpend the Day in Idleneſs, but in religious Imployments.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It pleaſed God to exerciſe her with great Pain in every Part of her Body, which did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing impair the Natural Quickneſs and Strength of her Senſes. But between two or three Months before her Death, her Underſtanding was bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to admiration.</p>
               <p n="8">8. When the Spring came on, and mention was made of the Publick Catechizing; ſhe Rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced greatly, and would be often ſpeaking of its drawing near. One Morning as ſhe lay in her Bed ſhe ſaid; O that charming Duty, O that ſweet Day is coming: Being aſk'd, what Day ſhe meant? She anſwered, Catechizing Day, I mean that ſweet Day. A few Days after ſhe ſaid, I won't depend upon going to Catechizing, for I believe I ſhall be prevented by ſome means or other. She was told, If ſhe was well and the Weather per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, nothing elſe wou'd hinder her. Ah! ſaid the Child, I am perſwaded, I ſhall be prevented ſome way or other from going. And according to the ſtrong Impulſe ſhe had upon her Mind, it proved to her: For ſhe was taken Sick two or three Days before the Catechizing came, which was in April 1718.</p>

               <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN She was firſt taken, ſhe was in ſome doubt of her ſpiritual State, and ſaid, She was afraid ſhe did not belong to God, nor love him as ſhe ſhould; for Mother, you have told me, that they that fear God and love him, would make it their chief Care and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to keep his Commandments; but I am afraid I have not kept them as I ought. Her Mother aſk'd her, what particular Command ſhe cou'd accuſe her ſelf of breaking? She ſaid, The Fifth Commandment ſaith, Honour thy Father and thy Mother, and have I honoured you? have I obeyed you as I ought? Her Mother told her; You have been an obedient Child to me, and wherein you have offended in any ſmall Matter, I do forgive you, and pray God to forgive you alſo.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Day following ſhe cryed out — I am a great Sinner, a great Sinner, what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of me, Oh! what will become of me, I am afraid that God will not have Mercy on me, my Sins are ſo many and ſo great. She was told, tho' her Sins were never ſo many and great, yet the Mercy of God was greater, and more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant than her Sins; for that was like himſelf In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and endureth forever, that there was For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs with him; and that he had Promiſed, that thoſe who confeſs and forſake their Sins ſhould
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005008_0015_100E5C747904B9B8"/>
Mercy. But ſaid the Child, Satan tempts me to Deſpair of Mercy, becauſe my Sins are ſo great and many. But ſhe was then Exhorted not to give way to the Temptations of Satan, but to hope in the Mercy of God; for the Lord taketh Pleaſure in them that Fear him, and in them that hope in his Mercy. And ſhe was told that he ſay'd in Iſa. 55.7. <q>Let the Wicked forſake his Way and the unrighteous Man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have Mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly Pardon.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. A while after ſhe ſaid, behold I was ſhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in Iniquity, and in Sin did my Mother con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me: I am a miſerable and ſinful Creature; Convinced I am of Sin, but afraid not Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; I am a poor Creature that has no ſight of my Intereſt in Chriſt; and without a Chriſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Chriſt, I am undone for ever; Oh for a Chriſt, Oh for a Chriſt, for a Chriſt to ſave me! And then ſhe prayed, and ſaid —</p>
               <p n="4">4. Lord, have Mercy on me according to thy loving Kindneſs; according to the Multitude of thy Tender Mercies blot out all my Trangreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions with thine own Blood: Waſn me thro'ly from mine Iniquities, and cleanſe me from my Sins: Create in me a clean Heart, O God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new a right Spirit within me: O give me a new Heart, a humble Heart, a broken Heart, and contrite Spirit: Oh Sanctify me by thy Holy Spirit thro' out, in Soul, Spirit, and Body: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new me in the whole Man after thine own I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage in Knowledge, Righteouſneſs and true Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs: Oh give me a Chriſt, give me thy Grace,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005008_0016_100E5C9B0E47E628"/>
Pardon all my Sins: O Lord take away all mine Iniquities, and receive me graciouſly, Circumciſe my Heart to fear thy Name, and lead me in the Way that is pleaſing in thy Sight: Oh be my God in Life, my Guide unto Death, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeble Portion of my Soul forever: Fit and prepare me for all Changes, but eſpecially for Death my great and laſt Change: And this I beg for thy Son Jeſus Chriſt's ſake, AMEN.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In the time of her Health ſhe was very careful of her Words, and no ill Language was ever heard to proceed from her Lips. Yet now in her Sickneſs, ſhe examin'd her ſelf what Sins ſhe had been Guilty of, both in Words and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And taking a view of the Commandments, ſome of them ſhe ſaid ſhe was afraid ſhe had been guilty of breaking, and did accuſe her ſelf of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience. and condemn'd her ſelf for her Sins. And being in great Pain of Body; ſhe ſaid, Now am I ſuffering the Deſert of my Sins: Oh that I might have but a Moments caſe: But I need not wonder that I have no caſe, for I deſerve none: Have Mercy upon me O Lord, for I am weak: O Lord heal me, for my Bones are ſore vexed: Look upon my Afflictions and my Pain, and forgive all my Sins.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Mr. <hi>Prince</hi> came in to ſee her: She deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to Pray with her: He aſk'd her what he ſhould Pray for? She anſwered That God would be pleas'd to Pardon all her Sins, and give her an Intereſt in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="7">7. A while after ſhe cried out, O I am a poor Creature that wants Aſſurance: Oh for Aſſurance, Oh for Aſſurance! Oh that God wou'd be pleas'd
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005008_0017_100E5C776231A1B0"/>
to lift up the Light of his Countenance upon me! O that he would be pleas'd to own me in his Covenant, and Bleſs me. Her Mother ſeeing her in this Diſtreſs, aſk'd her if ſhe ſhould ſend for Mr. SEWALL to talk with him, and hear what he had to ſay to her? The Child anſwered, Mr. SEWALL may give me Encouragement as you do, but except God ſpeaks to me too, all will ſignify nothing. Well Child, ſaid her Mother, wait upon God ſtill, who will in his own Time, I hope, ſpeak Peace to thy Soul. Mr. SEWALL was ſent for, but he was not at home.</p>
               <p n="8">8. She was told for her Encouragement, that ſhe was a Lamb of Chriſt's Flock; and that he had ſaid, he would take the Lambs in his Arms, and carry them in his Boſom; and ſuffer little Children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of ſuch is the Kingdom of Heaven; and you know that Promiſe in Prov. 8.17. I Love them that Love me, and thoſe that ſeek me early ſhall find me. The Child anſwered, If the Lord will pleaſe to help me, I will ſeek him. She was told that the Lord would help her, and was exhorted to truſt in the Free Grace and Mercy of God thro' Chriſt. Oh, ſaid the Child; I am willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Chriſt, but I am afraid Chriſt is not will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Anſwer was made, that if ſhe was willing to accept of Chriſt, that to be ſure Chriſt was will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to accept of her: She anſwered, I am willing.</p>
               <p n="9">9. A while after ſhe ſaid, I will venture my Soul upon Chriſt, and if I periſh, Lord, it ſhall be at the Fountain of thy Mercy: For thou haſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, that whoſoever cometh unto thee, thou wilt in no wiſe caſt out. O Lord I deſire as I am able, to come unto thee, and I am ſure thou wilt
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005008_0018_100E5C9CDC9FCDF8"/>
not caſt me off. And ſhe was compos'd for ſome time: But Satan aſſaulted her again in ſetting her Sins before her; and ſhe cried out, Oh the Sin of my Nature, (unleſs my Soul be ſprinkled with the Blood of Chriſt,) is enough to undoe me, were I guilty of no other.</p>
               <p n="10">10. About a Month before her Death, on the Sabbath in the Afternoon, ſhe ſaid to her Mother; Now I have a believing ſight of Chriſt: Now Chriſt is mine and I am his: Oh, how ſweet is Chriſt: Oh he is ſweet, he is ſweet! and if you did but taſte and feel what I do, you would long to be gone. Then ſhe ſaid; Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly: Dear Jeſus, ſweet Jeſus, come quickly. Then ſhe ſaid; Lord Jeſus give me Patience, give me Patience to wait thy Time, for thy Time is the beſt Time: Lord Jeſus give me Patience.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Her Mother ſat weeping by her, and to comfort her, the Child ſaid; Dear Mother, tho' we part now, it will be but a little while before you will follow and come to me: and that will be a happy meeting for us, to meet at the Right Hand of Chriſt in the great Day. Then ſhe thank'd her Mother for the Inſtructions and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections ſhe had given her, and ſaid had it not been for them I might have gone to Hell; but it won't be long now before the bleſſed Angels will come and carry my Soul to the Boſom of Chriſt; Oh I long to be gone, I long to be gone to that Bleſſed Place: Sweet Jeſus, come quickly.</p>
               <p n="12">12. A while after ſhe ſaid: My Pain is great which I undergo to go to Chriſt; but not ſo great as the Pains Chriſt underwent for me: Oh I won<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005008_0019_100E5C7C08813348"/>
I wonder that Chriſt ſhould be ſo willing to die for me who am ſo great a Sinner.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Mr. SEWALL was ſent for again; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came, the Child was ſpent with extream Pain and much ſpeaking, that ſhe was not able to ſay any thing to him. In the Night ſhe aſk'd the Young Woman that watched with her, to read the 25th of Matthew to her.</p>
               <p n="14">14. One Morning ſhe aſk'd; where is that Place of Scripture? Eat O Friends, drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved. The Glaſs ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Table, ſhe aſk'd to have it turned, and ſaid; my Glaſs is almoſt run, my Work is almoſt ended.</p>
               <p n="15">15. On Thurſday was three Weeks before her Death, her Mother ſeeing an Alteration in her, ſaid, my Child is ſtruck with Death. Upon which ſhe replyed, Is Death come and am I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, am I prepared? She lay ſtill for ſome time, and then ſaid; O Death where is thy Sting; O Grave where is thy Victory, and what wilt thou gain by this thing!</p>
               <p n="16">16. There was a Perſon ſhe had a peculiar Reſpect for, and deſired her Mother when ſhe had opportunity, to ſpeak to her; for ſhe was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid ſhe did not conſider her Soul and Eternity.</p>
               <p n="17">17. The Lord's Day following ſhe ſaid over the 23d Pſalm, and when ſhe had concluded it, her Mother aſk'd her; if ſhe was not afraid to paſs thro' the dark Valley of the ſhadow of Death? ſhe anſwer'd; No, for God hath promis'd that he will never leave me nor forſake me, neither will he ſuffer me to leave or forſake him.</p>
               <p n="18">18. She lying in great Pain Day and Night,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005008_0020_100E5CA09C985BB8"/>
wou'd often ſay, Lord Jeſus give me Patience, give me Patience, that I may not diſhonour God. She ſaid, Oh if I ſhou'd be deceiv'd at laſt, and deceive others, and they think <hi>I</hi> am Good, how miſerable ſhall <hi>I</hi> be forever?</p>
               <p n="19">19. Her Aunt <hi>Stone</hi> being preſent, and the Child being in great Pain, and complaining of thoſe about her, for refuſing to do ſomething for her which ſhe found relieved her, but they were fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of overdoing, ſhe ſaid,—They do not pity me, but <hi>I</hi> hope Chriſt pities me, and will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a Place for me. A little while after, being reſtleſs with her Pains, ſhe check'd her ſelf ſaying, —Why do <hi>I</hi> complain? Chriſt endured more than this for me: <hi>I</hi> wonder how he did to bear it. And a little while after hearing it Thunder; ſhe ſaid, it Thunders, <hi>I</hi> am afraid God will kill me with it; but whether he kills me with that, or with this Pain, if <hi>I</hi> may but go to Chriſt, it will be well.</p>
               <p n="20">20. The Tueſday following Mr. SEWALL came to ſee her, and after ſome Diſcourſe, he aſk'd he on what ſhe depended for Salvation? She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, on Chriſt and the Promiſes. He ſaid, well Child hold faſt thy Faith, and ſtill truſt in Chriſt. Then ſhe ſaid; Oh <hi>I</hi> long to be gone to that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Place. He aſked what bleſſed Place? She not readily anſwering, he ſaid; do you mean Heaven? She ſaid, Yes: And when he was going away, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd him to remember her in his Prayers: And aſk'd him when he would pleaſe to come again to ſee her?</p>
               <p n="21">21. Two Perſons being in the Room, they ſaid to one another; this Child has been a Child
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005008_0021_100E5C7FE73B8888"/>
affliction all its Days. The Child replyed; and it is for my Good.</p>
               <p n="22">22. She had another Combate with Satan and ſaid, He wou'd perſuade her that Chriſt was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from her: And ſhe cried out, Oh what ſhall <hi>I</hi> do, Oh what ſhall <hi>I</hi> do? <hi>I</hi> am undone! She ſaid, O Lord, caſt me not out of thy ſight; caſt me not away from thy preſence, and take not thy holy Spirit from me: Reſtore unto me the Joy of thy Salvation, and uphold me with thy free Spirit; never leave me nor forſake me: But guide me by thy Counſel while here, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards receive me to thine heavenly Kingdom: And this <hi>I</hi> aſk for thy Son Jeſus Chriſt's ſake; and in Teſtimony of my deſire and Aſſurance to be heard, <hi>I</hi> ſay, AMEN.</p>
               <p n="23">23. She was comforted again in the Night: And the Watcher ſitting by her Bed ſide, about Midnight, heard her ſay,
<q>
                     <l>Yonder, Yonder, up above,</l>
                     <l>Sits my Saviour, cloath'd in Love,</l>
                     <l>And there's my ſmiling God.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="24">24. She ſaid, ſhe had ſomething to ſay to Mr. SEWALL the next time he came to ſee her: And being aſk'd, what it was, ſhe ſaid, ſhe would thank him for the many Prayers he put up for her, for God had heard and anſwered them.</p>
               <p n="25">25. At another time ſhe ſaid concerning Chriſt; Why is his Chariot ſo long a coming? Why ſtay ſo long the Wheels of his Chariot? For me to ſtay is Pain; but to Die is Gain.</p>
               <p n="26">26. Mr. PRINCE coming to ſee her the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day before her Death, ſhe deſired him to Pray with her, he ſaid well, and what ſhall we Pray
