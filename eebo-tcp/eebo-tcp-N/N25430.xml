            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE BOARDING SCHOOL, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>ON the delightful margin of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimac, in one of the moſt pleaſant and beautiful ſituations, which that fertile and healthful part of America affords, lived Mrs. Williams, the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous relict of a reſpectable clergyman.</p>
            <p>She had two daughters, lovely and promiſing as ever parent could boaſt.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Williams's circumſtances were eaſy. She poſſeſſed a little patrimony, to which ſhe retired, after her huſband's deceaſe; but a deſire of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving this for her children, and a wiſh to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their advantage and enlarge their ſociety, induced her to open a Boarding School.</p>
            <p>As ſhe had an eye, no leſs to the ſocial pleaſure, than to the pecuniary profit of the undertaking, ſhe admitted only ſeven, at a time, to the privilege of her tuition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:033748_0004_0FF9214543A98BB8"/>Theſe were all young ladies, who had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly received the firſt rudiments of learning, and been initiated into the polite accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which embelliſh virtue and ſoften the cares of human life. They had generally lived in the metropolis, and had acquired the graces of a faſhionable deportment; but they poſſeſſed different tempers and diſpoſitions, which had been variouſly, and, in ſome reſpects, erroneouſly managed.</p>
            <p>To cultivate the expanding flowers, and to prune the juvenile eccentricities, which were diſſeminated among theſe tender plants; or, to ſpeak without a figure, to extend and purify their ideas, to elevate and refine their affections, to govern and direct their paſſions, required an eye, watchful, and a hand, ſkilful as thoſe of the judicious Mrs. Williams.</p>
            <p>While her judgment and prudence aided the uſeful acquiſitions of the mind, a ſprightly fancy and a cheerful diſpoſition, regulated by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and diſcretion, qualified her to enter, at once, with becoming dignity and condeſcending eaſe, into all their concerns; to participate their pleaſures; while, with candour and mildneſs, ſhe reproved their errors, detected their follies, and facilitated their amendment.</p>
            <p>As the young ladies had finiſhed their ſchool education, before Mrs. Williams received them to her manſion, her inſtructions were more
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:033748_0005_0FF9214F58F76350"/>
eſpecially deſigned to poliſh the mental part, to call forth the dormant virtues, to unite and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range the charms of perſon and mind, to inſpire a due ſenſe of decorum and propriety, and to inſtil ſuch principles of piety, morality, benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, prudence and economy, as might be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful through life.</p>
            <p>Their time was, accordingly, diſpoſed in a manner moſt conducive to the attainment of theſe objects. Every part of it was employed to ſome valuable purpoſe; "for idleneſs," Mrs. Williams obſerved, "is the ruſt of the mind."</p>
            <p>Whatever tended to enlarge, inform, improve, or amuſe, ſhe ſuppoſed worthy their attention.</p>
            <p>She particularly endeavoured to domeſticate them; to turn their thoughts to the beneficial and neceſſary qualifications of private life; often inculcating, that
<q>
                  <l>Nothing lovelier can be found in woman,</l>
                  <l>Than to ſtudy houſehold good;</l>
               </q>
and labouring to convince them of the utter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificance and uſeleſſneſs of that part of the ſex, who are
<q>
                  <l>Bred only and completed to the taſte</l>
                  <l>Of luſtful appetence; to ſing, to dance,</l>
                  <l>To dreſs, and troll the tongue, and roll the eye.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Early riſing ſhe recommended, both by precept and example. This, ſhe ſaid, would not only
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033748_0006_0FF9217A04DB9378"/>
promote their health, but render them miſtreſſes of many hours, which muſt otherwiſe be loſt in enervating ſloth and inaction. "And ſhould we," continued ſhe, "who have ſo much cauſe for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion, thus ſacrifice the beſt part of our time?"</p>
            <l>"Falſely luxurious, will not man awake,</l>
            <l>And, ſtarting from the bed of ſloth, enjoy</l>
            <l>The cool, the fragrant, and the ſilent hour,</l>
            <l>To meditation due, and ſacred ſong?</l>
            <l>And is there aught in ſleep can charm the wiſe?</l>
            <l>To lie in dead oblivion, loſing half</l>
            <l>The fleeting moments of too ſhort a life?</l>
            <l>Total extinction of th' enlighten'd ſoul!</l>
            <l>Or elſe to ſeveriſh vanity alive,</l>
            <l>Wilder'd and toſſing through diſtemper'd dreams?</l>
            <l>Who would in ſuch a gloomy ſtate remain,</l>
            <l>Longer than nature craves; when every muſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </l>
            <l>And every blooming pleaſure wait without,</l>
            <l>To bleſs the wildly devious morning walk?"</l>
            <p>Another laudable practice of Mrs. Williams, was perfect regularity in the government of her pupils, and in the arrangement of their daily exerciſes. "When," ſaid ſhe, "we obſerve the order of the natural world, and admire the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency and harmony of every part, we may hence derive a leſſon, for the regulation of our conduct, in the ſphere aſſigned to us."</p>
            <p>Purſuant to this plan of operation, the young ladies aroſe at five; from which they had two hours at their own diſpoſal, till the bell ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned them at ſeven, to the hall, where, the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033748_0007_0FF921C4D229E700"/>
ceremonies of the morning ſalutation over, they breakfaſted together; their repaſt being ſeaſoned with the unreſtrained effuſions of good humour and ſociability. On theſe occaſions, Mrs. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams ſuſpended the authority of the matron, that, by accuſtoming her pupils to familiarity in her preſence, they might be free from reſtraint; and, feeling perfectly eaſy and unawed, appear in their genuine characters. By this mean ſhe had an opportunity of obſerving any indecorum of behaviour, or wrong bias; which ſhe kept in mind, till a proper time to mention, and remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate againſt it; a method, the ſalutary effects of which were viſible in the daily improvement of her pupils.</p>
            <p>The breakfaſt table removed, each took her needle-work, except one, who read ſome amuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and inſtructive book, for the benefit and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of the reſt. The ſubject was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by Mrs. Williams, who conferred the reading upon them in rotation.</p>
            <p>At twelve o'clock, they were diſmiſſed till one, when dinner again called them together, which was conducted in the ſame manner as the morning repaſt.</p>
            <p>Having reſumed their occupations, the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the day produced ſome piece of her own compoſition, either in proſe, or verſe, according to her inclination, as a ſpecimen of her genius and improvement. This being ſubmitted to Mrs.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:033748_0008_0FF9221D538B3068"/>
Williams's inſpection, and the candid peruſal and criticiſm of her companions; and the ſubject canvaſſed with great freedom of opinion, they withdrew from the taſks of the day to ſeek that relaxation and amuſement, which each prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. No innocent gratification was denied them. The ſprightly dance, the ſentimental ſong, and indeed every ſpecies of paſtime, conſiſtent with the decorum of the ſex, was encouraged, as tending to health, cheerfulneſs, and alacrity.</p>
            <p>In theſe pleaſing purſuits and enjoyments, the preſent claſs of happy companions had nearly completed the term allotted them by their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and were ſoon to leave the peaceful ſhades in which they delighted, when, being aſſembled on the Monday morning of their laſt week, their revered Preceptreſs thus accoſted them:</p>
            <p>"As the period is approaching, my dear pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pils, when I muſt reſign your ſociety, and quit the important charge of inſtructor and friend, which I have ſuſtained with ſo much pleaſure, and, I truſt, with ſome degree of fidelity, I ſhall ſum up the counſels, admonitions, and advice, which I have frequently inculcated, and endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to impreſs them on your minds, as my vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory addreſs. For this purpoſe, during this laſt week of your reſidence with me, I ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with your uſual exerciſes, and ſubſtitute a collection of my own ſentiments, enforced by the pathos of the occaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:033748_0009_0FF9227E8C0410A8"/>"Your docility, and cheerful diligence in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to my inſtructions; your modeſt, affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate, and reſpectful behaviour, together with the laudable progreſs you have made in every branch, which you have purſued, have well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded my care, and engaged my approbation and love. To me, therefore, a ſeparation will be painful. To you the period is important. It is a period, which, while it relieves you from the confinement of ſcholaſtic rules, introduces you to new ſcenes of cares, of pleaſures, of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and of temptations, which will call for the exerciſe of every virtue, and afford opportunity for improving the endowments, both natural and acquired, which you poſſeſs. Think not, then, that your emancipation from ſchools, gives you liberty to neglect the advantages which you have received from them. The obligations under which you are laid to your parents for the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation they have given you, require a diligent improvement of every talent committed to your truſt.</p>
            <p>"Of needle-work you are complete miſtreſſes, from the moſt delicate and highly finiſhed, to the moſt ordinary, though perhaps not leſs uſeful, economy of mending and making the coarſer garments of family uſe. Many, I am aware, ſuppoſe <hi>this laſt</hi> a ſpecies of learning, which is beneath the attention of a lady: but Clara will
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:033748_0010_0FF92284363D19F0"/>
tell you how valuable it has proved to her; and how valuable it <hi>may</hi> prove to you.</p>
            <p>"Nurſed in the lap of affluence, and accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to unbounded expenſe, Clara little thought, at your age, that ſhe ſhould ever depend on her needle for the livelihood and decent appearance of a riſing family. A diſcreet and prudent moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er early inculcated the leſſons of induſtry and economy, which ſhe now practices; and taught her that the knowledge could be of no diſſervice, though ſhe never had occaſion for it. She mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with the brighteſt proſpects. But a ſeries of unavoidable diſaſters, ſuch as no human wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom could foreſee or prevent, reduced her to narrow circumſtances; and, to complete her misfortune, ſhe was left a widow with four ſmall children. Her parents were in the grave; her patrimony was gone! In this exigence, what was her reſource? Not fruitleſs lamentations, and unavailing complaints. She immediately ſummoned her reſolution; and by the uſe of her needle has ever ſince ſupported herſelf and family with decency, and been highly reſpected for her prudent exertions and exemplary induſtry. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly the reverſe of this amiable character is that of Belinda. She was educated in the ſame way with Clara; the ſame ſchools gave them tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition; and ſimilar proſpects awaited their entrance into life. Calamities attended the progreſs of each; but different as their tempers and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:033748_0011_0FF9228FE2730010"/>
was their conduct under them. The fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fortunes of Clara were awhile ſuſpended by her diſcretion and frugality; while the ruin of Belinda was haſtened by her extravagance, diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, and idleneſs. View them, now, in their reduced ſtate! Neatneſs, cheerfulneſs, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity preſide in the dwelling of Clara; negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, peeviſhneſs, and ſloth are legibly ſtamped on that of Belinda. The ear is pained by her complaints of poverty; the eye is diſguſted by her ſlatternly appearance, and oſtentatious diſplay of the tattered remnants of finery, which beſpeak the pride and indolence of their owner; who will neither convert them into more comfortable garments, nor, by repairing, render them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming.</p>
            <p>"I hope, however, that occaſions like theſe may never call for your exertions. But there may be caſes, when, to know the uſe of your needles will anſwer important purpoſes, even in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted ſtation, and amidſt the ſplendor of afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and plenty.</p>
            <p>"Matilda dignified a princely fortune by the exerciſe of every virtue which can adorn a lady. Among theſe, charity ſhone conſpicuous. Her maid ſaid to her, one day, Madam, would you have me lay aſide theſe caſt-clothes for ſome poor perſon? Yes, replied Matilda; but ſit down, and mend them firſt. Don't you ſee they need it? Why, Madam, rejoined the girl, is it not enough
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:033748_0012_0FF8C5DEDA6E0978"/>
for you to give them away? I ſhould think the leaſt they can do is to mend them for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves! In that caſe, ſaid Matilda, my bounty would be greatly diminiſhed. People, who need charity have not the neceſſary materials for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſuch articles into repair; and ſhould I fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them, perhaps they have never been taught to uſe their needles. No more have I, returned the maid. Have you not? ſaid Matilda. Well then, ſit down, and I will direct your ingenuity upon theſe clothes. By this mean you may learn a very uſeful leſſon, I aſſure you; a leſſon, which by practiſing for yourſelf, will enable you to lay up part of your wages againſt the time when ſickneſs or old age ſhall take you from your labours.</p>
            <p>"Such examples of condeſcenſion and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to inferiors, are of more real and laſting uſe than pounds prodigally beſtowed.</p>
            <p>"Do you ſeek higher teſtimonies of the honor and utility of this employment? You may col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect many from the hiſtories which you have read during the laſt year. Among the Romans, and ſeveral other nations of antiquity, a ſcarf, wrought by the needle of a favourite fair, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as an honorable token of reſpect, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved as an invincible ſtimulus to heroic deeds. Ladies of the firſt rank and ſtation conſidered it as no derogation from the dignity or delicacy of their character, to make their own apparel,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:033748_0013_0FF922972FC33FC8"/>
and that of their families. The virtuous Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea, when her huſband was going to fight in the cauſe of Cyrus, her generous deliverer, magnificently adorned his perſon, and decorated his armour with her own needle-work.</p>
            <p>"We ought never to be idle. No moment ſhould be unoccupied. Some employment, ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utary, either to body or mind, or both, ſhould be conſtantly purſued; and the needle is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at hand to ſupply the want of other avoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The liſtleſs vacuity, which ſome young ladies indulge, renders them extremely unhappy, though they are inſenſible of the cauſe, and ſeek to beguile the time in frivolous amuſements.</p>
            <p>"A ſtill more endearing motive remains to be ſuggeſted; and that is the pleaſure, which your accompliſhments in this ornamental and uſeful art muſt afford your parents; and the pain, which your neglect of it hereafter muſt occaſion them.</p>
            <p>"But your faithful and aſſiduous improvement of time, ſince you have been with me, is a ſure pledge of your perſeverance in the path of duty, and your progreſs in every virtue.

               <p>BEING aſſembled, this afternoon, Mrs. Williams thus reſumed her diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>"Reading is ſo common a part of education, that the value of it is not duly eſtimated; nor the manner of performing it, ſufficiently attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to. It is not the mere propriety of pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, accent, and cadence, which conſtitutes good reading. You muſt enter into the ſpirit of the ſubject, and feel intereſted in the matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you can profit by the exerciſe.</p>
               <p>"But you are ſo well acquainted with the manner of reading, that the quality of books moſt worthy of your peruſal is the only point on which I need to enlarge.</p>
               <p>"Romances, the taſte of former times, are now ſo far out of vogue, that it is hardly neceſſary to warn you againſt them. They exhibit the ſpirit of chivalry, knight-errantry, and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant folly, which prevailed in the age they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pict. But they are not intereſting; nor can they be pleaſing to the correct taſte and refined deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the preſent day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="unknown:033748_0016_0FF922ACF79F8468"/>"Novels are the favourite, and the moſt danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous kind of reading, now adopted by the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erality of young ladies. I ſay dangerous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the influence, which, with very few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, they muſt have upon the paſſions of youth, bears an unfavourable aſpect on their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and virtue. The ſtyle in which they are written is commonly captivating; and the lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uriance of the deſcriptions with which they abound, extremely agreeable to the ſprightly fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and high expectations of the inexperienced and unreflecting. Their romantic pictures of love, beauty, and magnificence, fill the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with ideas which lead to impure deſires, a vanity of exterior charms, and a fondneſs for ſhow and diſſipation, by no means conſiſtent with that ſimplicity, modeſty, and chaſtity, which ſhould be the conſtant inmates of the female breaſt. They often pervert the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, miſlead the affections, and blind the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</p>
               <p>"A melancholy example of this ſort is exhib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited in Juliana. Juliana was the only daughter of a wealthy merchant, who grudged no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe which could pleaſe or embelliſh his dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling child. He, however, poſſeſſed neither leiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure nor abilities "to teach the young idea how to ſhoot;" but thought it ſufficient that he gave her every advantage, which could be derived from the various ſchools, to which ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned.
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:033748_0017_0FF922B3B29733D0"/>
She had a brilliant fancy, and a fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for books, which, properly directed, might have proved of great uſe to her. But, having no better principles inſtilled into her mind, ſhe indulged herſelf in the unlimited reading of novels, and every light publication which a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating library could furniſh.</p>
               <p>"Hence her imagination took wing, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her far above the ſcenes of common life. The exceſſive refinement of her mind admitted no ordinary amuſements or avocations. Plain truth from her own ſex was an inſult; and from the other, nothing leſs than adoration would ſatisfy her unbounded vanity. Her beauty (of which ſhe really had a conſiderable ſhare) and the large fortune which ſhe would probably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit, gained her many admirers; ſome of whom were men of unqueſtionable merit. But a ſober, rational courtſhip could not anſwer her ideas of love and gallantry. The ſwain, who would not die for her, ſhe deemed unworthy of notice.</p>
               <p>"Her father ſtrongly recommended a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as well calculated, in his opinion, to make her happy, and as having his entire approbation; but ſhe rejected him with diſdain, though ſhe could produce no one objection againſt his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or character.</p>
               <p>"Her father acquieſced; expreſſing, however, his regret at the miſtaken notions ſhe had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed; and warning her moſt pathetically againſt
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:033748_0018_0FF923A2A4D394F0"/>
the indulgence of ſo romantic a diſpoſition; yet all in vain. He was conſidered as an illiterate plodder after wealth, which ſhe had a right to beſtow as ſhe pleaſed.</p>
               <p>"At laſt the lovely youth whom ſhe had ſo long contemplated, made his appearance. A mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itary captain entered the town on the recruiting ſervice. Young, handſome, eaſy, bold and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming; with all the <hi>bon ton</hi> of the coxcomb, and all the inſolence of the novice. He ſaw Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liana; he ſacrificed to her charms, and conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. She could not reſiſt the allurements of his gallantry. His affectation of dying love was received with apparent pleaſure; while art and duplicity took advantage of her weakneſs, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate her into engagements to pity and relieve him. Her friends ſaw her danger, and warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remonſtrated againſt her imprudent conduct, in receiving the addreſſes of a man, deſtitute of property to ſupport her, and void of every kind of perſonal merit. Her father entreated and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored the rejection of her lover, till, finding every other method vain, he at length reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbade him the houſe, and his daughter's company. This was viewed as perſecution; and, conſiſtently with her ſentiments of adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous love, a clandeſtine amour was commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Her father ſurpriſed them together; and, enraged at their diſgraceful intrigue, ſeized the captain, and endeavoured to turn him out of doors.
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:033748_0019_0FF923AEFA7B67B0"/>
He violently reſented this ungentlemanlike treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as he termed it, and defended himſelf with his ſword. The old gentleman received a ſlight wound, in the ſcuffle; but accompliſhed his purpoſe. Juliana was terrified at this ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, and, dreading her father's diſpleaſure, ran out with her paramour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His lodgings were near, and thither, favoured by the darkneſs of the night, he inſtantly led her. She involunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily followed him, without conſidering the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety of her conduct. Here he drew his ſword, and, throwing himſelf at her feet, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed his deſpair, and declared himſelf reſolved to put an immediate end to his life. She en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to reaſon him into calmneſs; but in vain. He was ſenſible, that, if he now relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed her to her father, he ſhould loſe her forever. His apparent agony overcame her, and ſhe gave him her hand.</p>
               <p>"Her father was almoſt diſtracted at her elope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He traced her ſteps, and, following her to the houſe, condeſcended to ſoothe her with parental kindneſs; and promiſed her pardon and continued affection, if ſhe would renounce her worthleſs lover, and return. She confeſſed it was too late; that ſhe was his wife.</p>
               <p>"Petrified with aſtoniſhment, he looked at her, for ſome time, with ſpeechleſs grief; and, ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his arm, bound up with the wound he had
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:033748_0020_0FF923B3CE76A6E8"/>
received, left her with every token of anguiſh and indignation!</p>
               <p>"When the fever of paſſion had abated, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning ſenſe of duty in Juliana, and, in the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, the fear of loſing the property which he ſought, induced them to ſeek a reconciliation, and make ſubmiſſive efforts to obtain it. But her father was too highly incenſed to grant it to him, on any terms; or to her, on any other than the utter rejection of her unworthy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion. Theſe terms were not complied with.</p>
               <p>"Sorrow and vexation preyed ſo deeply upon the mind of this afflicted parent, that they brought on a rapid decline; and he died without again ſeeing his undutiful and ruined daughter. His eſtate was divided between Juliana and her four brothers. Her portion was received by her huſband, and ſoon ſpent in diſſipation and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. Having rioted on the fortune of his wife, while ſhe often pined at home for want of the common neceſſaries of life, he left her, to join his regiment, promiſing remittances from time to time, for her ſupport. This promiſe, however, was but ill performed; and ſhe now feels the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful effects of her folly, in the accumulated ills of poverty and neglect. Yet ſhe ſtill cheriſhes the moſt paſſionate fondneſs for what has proved her bane. A friend called to ſee her, not long ſince, and found her the emblem of wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſloth. Her emaciated form, her ſqualid
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:033748_0021_0FF923BD72CE2638"/>
appearance, the diſorder of her houſe, and her tattered raiment, beſpoke the ſhameful negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the owner. Yet ſhe was ſitting with a novel in her hand, over which ſhe had apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been weeping. She expatiated largely on the tale it contained, while her children, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited a picture of real woe, engaged not her attention. Her friend enquired how ſhe could be thus intereſted and diſtreſſed by mere fiction, while every thing about her was calculated to arouſe the keeneſt feelings of her ſoul! She coolly replied, I have fortitude ſufficient to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port my own calamity, but I muſt ſympathize with the heroine of adverſity. I have not loſt my ſenſibility with my fortune. My only luxury is now imagination! How ill-timed, and how improperly exerted, was this kind of ſenſibility, in Juliana! Where, and what was her ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, when ſhe diſobeyed an indulgent parent, ſacrificed her reputation, and threw herſelf into the arms of a worthleſs man for protection— from what? from the kindneſs and love of her beſt friends!</p>
               <p>"But I would not be underſtood to condemn all novels indiſcriminately; though great pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is neceſſary to make a uſeful ſelection. Some of them are fraught with ſentiment; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey leſſons for moral improvement; and exhibit ſtriking pictures of virtue rewarded; and of vice, folly, and indiſcretion puniſhed; which may
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:033748_0022_0FF923BFB31A8118"/>
prove encouragements to imitate, or warnings to avoid ſimilar practices. I ſhall not deſcend to particulars. Thoſe, which are ſanctioned by the general voice of delicacy and refinement, may be allowed a reading; yet none ſhould engroſs your minds, to the neglect of more important objects; nor be ſuffered to monopolize too large a portion of your time.</p>
               <p>"Novels are a kind of light reading, on which the imagination feaſts, while the more ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial food which is requiſite to the nouriſhment of the underſtanding, is either untaſted or undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted. Imagination is a ſportive faculty, which ſhould be curbed by the reins of prudence and judgment. Its ſallies are delightful in youth, provided they be not too excurſive.</p>
               <p>"Poetry is, by ſome, ranked with novels; but I think injudiciouſly. Good poetry is certainly a ſublime ſource of entertainment and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. What muſic is to the ear, poetry is to the heart. There muſt, indeed, be a natural taſte for it, before it can be highly reliſhed or enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and this taſte, wherever it exiſts, ſhould be cultivated. I know of no kind of reading more richly formed for the mental repaſt of a liberal and poliſhed young lady, than the poetical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of true genius. The trifling and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delicate cantos of ordinary witlings, and every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day poetaſters, are unworthy your attention. But the ſpecies of poetry which I now recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:033748_0023_0FF923C56143F208"/>
is peculiarly adapted to ſoften the paſſions, excite ſympathy, and meliorate the affections. It ſoothes the jarring cares of life, and, pervading the ſecret receſſes of the ſoul, ſerves to rouſe and animate its dormant powers.</p>
               <p>"Many eſſays, written by monitors of both ſexes, are extant, which you may find profitable and pleaſing, both in youth and more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced age. Among the foremoſt of theſe, I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Mrs. Chapone's letters to her niece, which contain a valuable treaſure of information and advice.</p>
               <p>"But among your hours devoted to reading, hiſtory muſt not be without a place. Here an extenſive field of ages and generations, which have gone before you, is opened to your view. Here your curioſity may be gratified by a retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of events, which, by conducting your thoughts to remoteſt elimes and periods, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts and enlarges the mind. Here the various revolutions, the riſe, fall, and diſmemberment of ancient kingdoms and ſtates may be traced to the different ſprings of action, in which they originated. Hence you may gain a competent acquaintance with human nature in all its mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifications, from the moſt rude and barbarous, to the moſt civilized and poliſhed ſtages of ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This is a ſpecies of knowledge, which will not only be of conſtant uſe to you, in the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment of your own temper and manners, but
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:033748_0024_0FF923C6F567EBB8"/>
highly ornamental in your intercourſe with the polite and learned world.</p>
               <p>"But let your reading of every deſcription be regular and methodical. Never confuſe your minds by a variety of ſubjects at once. When you turn your attention to any one in particular, finiſh, and lay that aſide, before you take up another. Let what you read be well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood at the time, and well digeſted afterwards. Poſſeſs yourſelves, at leaſt, of the leading traits: otherwiſe your labour will be totally loſt. If con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, always recapitulate what you have been peruſing, and annex to it your own ſentiments and remarks, to ſome friend. If you have no friend at hand, who will be diſpoſed to hear, recollect, and run it over in your own thoughts. This will be a great aſſiſtance to memory. But whatever be the kind of reading which you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake, ſelect ſuch authors as good judges eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem the beſt, upon the ſubject. Have a partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular regard to the morality and delicacy of the books you peruſe.</p>
               <p>"When you read for mere amuſement, (which ſhould ſeldom happen) be careful not to corrupt and vitiate your taſte by frothy and illiberal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, which will degrade the dignity and fully the purity of your minds. That time is very greatly miſpent, which is beſtowed in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what can yield no inſtruction. Not a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's attention ſhould be given to books which

afford not ſome degree of improvement. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways have an eye, therefore, to profit, as well as to pleaſure. Remember that youth is the ſeed-time of life. You are now to cultivate that knowledge, which future years muſt ripen. Free from thoſe domeſtic cares, which will engroſs and occupy your minds, when placed at the head of families, a moſt ineſtimable price is now put into your hands to get wiſdom.

               <p>"Look upon Elvira. Her acquirements in a ſingle ſtate have qualified her for a ſhining pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of matronal duties. Her huſband's buſineſs abroad prevents him from attending to domeſtic avocations; nor need he be anxious reſpecting the management of his houſehold affairs. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vira is preſent to every occaſion. The ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendence of her family, and the education of her children is her delight. Capable of inſtructing them in every needful branch of ſcience, and of furniſhing them with every requiſite endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhe is, at once, their guide, their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and their friend. When her huſband re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns from the cares and fatigues of buſineſs, with what becoming eaſe and cheerfulneſs does ſhe diſſipate the anxiety which ſometimes hangs upon his brow, and exhilerate his ſpirits by the

enlivening charms of rational and refined con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation! In the entertainment of their friends, how diſtinguiſhed a part ſhe ſuſtains! Her pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of mind have been ſo happily improved, that ſhe is able to diſcuſs every ſubject with eaſe and propriety. To an enlarged underſtanding and a cultivated taſte, to an extenſive knowledge of the world and an acquaintance with polite literature, ſhe ſuperadds thoſe amiable virtues, which give ſociety its higheſt reliſh; while the elegance of her manners and the modeſty of her deportment are a proof of the greatneſs of her mind, and render her eſteemed, beloved, and reſpected by all who know her.</p>
               <p>"But I flatter myſelf that each of you, my dear pupils, will be an Elvira. Then will you do juſtice to the ſuperior advantages of your edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; be the delight of your friends, and the ornaments of your country.</p>
               <p>"Religious ſubjects muſt, by no means, be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in the courſe of your reading. Let the BIBLE be the rule of your faith and practice. If you wiſh an explanation of any particular paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, ſeek it from ſome judicious and pious friend, or in the writings of ſome judicious and learned commentator. But always attend chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to thoſe points which ſerve to mend the heart, rather than to thoſe knotty, metaphyſical diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, which tend only to perplex the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and involve the inquirer in ſuch laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths

               <p>"Writing is productive both of pleaſure and improvement. It is a ſource of entertainment which enlarges the mental powers more, perhaps, than any other.

               <p>"Celia and Cecilia were companions at a board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſchool. When ſeparated, they commenced an epiſtolary correſpondence, on which each val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued herſelf. Their former intimacy, which they termed friendſhip, prompted them to write with
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:033748_0032_0FF926332E8CF248"/>
unlimited confidence; and, without the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, to reveal every dictate of levity and thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs folly. They imagined themſelves perfectly ſecure from the cenſure of the critic. Their education had not taught them, that a virtuous mind ſhould ſhrink even from ideal indelicacy. Celia was courted by Silvander, a young man of whom ſhe was paſſionately fond; but ſhe had art and reſolution enough to conceal her letters from his inſpection, though he often ſolicited a communication of her correſpondence. At length he became impatient for a peruſal of letters which appeared ſo pleaſing and intereſting to the parties, and ſuſpicious that ſome particular cauſe directed their privacy. Influenced by theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, Silvander bribed a market-boy, who came from the village where Cecilia lived, and always conveyed the letters to and from her, to give them firſt into his hand. How aſtoniſhed was he to find the lightneſs of mind exemplified in them! Purity of ſentiment, delicacy of thought, and refinement of taſte were entirely laid aſide; and illiberal wit, frothy jeſts, double entendres, and ridiculous love-tales were ſubſtituted in their place. His name was uſed with ſo much free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and every circumſtance relative to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe, and propoſed connexion with Celia, was bandied with ſuch familiarity, that he was mortified, diſguſted, and chagrined, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme. He had the policy, however, to conceal

the diſcovery till he had copied a conſiderable number of Celia's letters, leaving out whatever had reference to his own affairs. He then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged himſelf by diſcloſing his knowledge to her, avowing his indignation at her weakneſs, duplicity and folly, and taking an immediate and final leave. Not content with this, he even cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated her letters among his acquaintance. This fixed the ſtamp of ignominy on the correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; and their names and characters were ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as ridiculous as ſcandal and malicious wit could deſire.</p>

In the midſt of theſe difficulties, his amiable and beloved wife was removed by death. This trial was greater than he could ſupport. He ſunk un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the affliction, and loſt his reaſon. Lucinda was the eldeſt of ſix children, the care of whom, with the melancholy taſk of attending and miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering to the neceſſities of her unhappy father, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved on her.

All who knew her motives and merit frequented her ſhop, and encouraged her by their cuſtom and kindneſs.

But in the midſt of hilarity and mirth, remember that modeſty, diffidence, diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and humility are indiſpenſable appendages of virtue and decency.</p>
               <p>"Muſic is a talent which nature has beſtowed, and which your application has conſiderably im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.

               <p>"Muſic and dancing, though polite and elegant accompliſhments, are, perhaps, the moſt faſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating, and, of courſe, the moſt dangerous of any that fall under that deſcription.

               <p>"Flattery was pleaſing to her ear, in whatever form it was preſented. The gay and licentious ſought her ſociety; and vanity with its attendant train of follies led her imagination far from the ſphere of life which Providence had aſſigned her. Her parents ſaw their own miſtake, and were alarmed at her's: but, alas! too late were their endeavours to prevent the miſchiefs which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended.

Wholly unacquainted with the world, and unſuſpicious of the ſubtle arts of the deluding libertine, ſhe ſcrupled not his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity, but liſtened to his inſinuating declarations of love and friendſhip. She was deceived by the vanity of appearing where her fancied merit would meet with the encouragement and reward it deſerved; and vainly imagining that her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty might ſecure her elevation and affluence, ſhe readily conſented to the fatal experiment, eloped from her father's houſe, and became a profeſſed actreſs.</p>
               <p>"Her parents were overwhelmed with grief and anxiety, at the diſcovery; but to no purpoſe were all their exertions to reclaim her.

               <head>Wednesday, A. M. <hi>MISCELLANEOUS DIRECTIONS</hi> for the <hi>GOVERNMENT</hi> of the <hi>TEMPER</hi> and <hi>MANNERS.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>"I SHALL now," ſaid Mrs. Williams, "endeavour to ſketch out for you the plan of conduct, which I think will be moſt conducive to your honor and happineſs while in a ſingle ſtate. Hitherto you have been under the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of parents, guardians, and inſtructors, who have regulated your deportment, and laboured to give you juſt ideas upon every ſubject and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. That period is now over. You are now launching into life, where you will think and act more for yourſelves.</p>
               <p>"The path of rectitude, my dear young friends, is narrow and intricate. Temptations lurk a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round to beguile your feet aſtray; and dangers which appear inſurmountable will often ariſe to affright you from the ways of virtue.</p>
               <p>"But remember that a crown of honor and happineſs awaits the undeviating purſuit of truth and duty. Let religion be your guide, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion your handmaid. Thus attended, you
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:033748_0047_0FF92796EB866138"/>
will eſcape the ſnares of youth, and ſurmount the perplexing cares of more advanced age. At your entrance on the ſtage of action, the allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of pleaſure will ſpread innumerable charms to court your acceptance. Beware of their faſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating wiles; and whatever courſe you adopt, be ſure it is ſuch as will bear the teſt of examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reflection. Let theſe be the criterion of all your purſuits and enjoyments. Make it an invariable practice to re-trace the actions and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences of the day, when you retire to reſt; to account with your own hearts for the uſe and improvement of the paſt hours; and rectify whatever you find amiſs, by greater vigilance and caution, in future; to avoid the errors into which you have fallen, and to diſcharge the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties incumbent upon you.</p>
               <p>"To neglect this, will be a ſource of great inadvertencies and failings.</p>
               <p>"To know yourſelves, in every particular, muſt be your conſtant endeavour. This knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge will lead you to propriety and conſiſtency of action. But this knowledge cannot be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained without a thorough and repeated inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your various paſſions, affections, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſities. When obtained, however, it will prevent the ill effects of flattery, by which you will doubtleſs be endangered, as you advance into the ſcenes of faſhionable life. It will ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you to diſtinguiſh flattery from that generous
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:033748_0048_0FF928B323FC43D8"/>
praiſe which is the effuſion of a feeling heart, affected by the perception of real merit. A young lady, unſkilled in the deceitful arts of a giddy world, is very apt to be miſled by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulation which is offered at the ſhrine of vanity. She is conſidered as a mark for the wit of every coxcomb, who wiſhes to diſplay his gallantry.</p>
               <p>"Flattery is a dazzling meteor, which caſts a deluſive glare before the eye; and which ſeduces the imagination, perverts the judgment, and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences the dictates of ſound reaſon. Flattery is, therefore, the poiſon and bane of the youthful mind. It renders the receiver blind to thoſe defects which ſhe ought to ſee and rectify, and proud of imaginary graces which ſhe never yet poſſeſſed. Self-knowledge, as before obſerved, will facilitate the detection of this diſguiſed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, by enabling you to inveſtigate your real accompliſhments and merits.</p>
               <p>"That praiſe which is the reſult of deſerved approbation from thoſe, whoſe good opinion you wiſh to enjoy, is worthy your attention and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acceptance: but the fulſome compliments and hyperbolical profeſſions of unmeaning and empty pretenders, calculated only to fill the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agination with the inflammable air of ſelf-conceit and arrogant pride, ſhould be rejected with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, and cordially deſpiſed by every lady of ſenſe and ſentiment, as an inſult upon her underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and an indignity to her ſenſibility.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="unknown:033748_0049_0FF928B613292E90"/>"Let it, therefore, be known to thoſe who court your favour by an oſtentatious parade of admiration and obſequiouſneſs, that their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation and duplicity are diſcovered, and that you are ſuperior to ſuch futility.</p>
               <p>"In order to diſcriminate between flattery and merited praiſe, critically examine your own heart and life. By this mean you will aſcertain what is really your due, and what is merely the effect of this inſidious art. But let no ideas of your own endowments, however juſt, elate you with an opinion of your ſuperior powers of pleaſing.</p>
               <p>"Be not oſtentatious of your charms, either of perſon or mind. Let modeſty, diffidence, and propriety regulate you, in regard to each. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted advantages will render you an object of envy to the weak minded of your own ſex, and of ſatire to the ill-natured part of the other. Never obtrude even your real graces and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments upon the world. The penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and judicious will ſee and applaud them, while retiring from the gaze of a misjudging and miſrepreſenting throng.</p>
               <l>"Naked in nothing ſhould a woman be,</l>
               <l>But veil her very wit with modeſty;</l>
               <l>Let man diſcover; let her not diſplay;</l>
               <l>But yield her charms of mind with ſweet delay."</l>
               <p>"Thoſe who are ſolicitous for beauty ſhould remember that the expreſſion of the countenance,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:033748_0050_0FF928BA5EFC4428"/>
in which its very eſſence conſiſts, depends on the diſpoſition of the mind.</p>
               <l>"What's female beauty, but an air divine,</l>
               <l>Thro' which the mind's all gentle graces ſhine?</l>
               <l>Theſe, like the ſun, irradiate all between;</l>
               <l>The body charms, becauſe the ſoul is ſeen.</l>
               <l>Hence men are often captives of a face,</l>
               <l>They know not why; of no peculiar grace.</l>
               <l>Some forms, tho' bright, no mortal man can bear;</l>
               <l>Some, none reſiſt, tho' not exceeding fair."</l>
               <p>"Beauty, my dear girls, is indeed a deſirable quality. Neither the pen of the moraliſt, nor the ſpleen of the ſatyriſt, nor the envy of ſuch as want it, could ever bring it into contempt or neglect. Yet mere external beauty is tranſient as the meteor, and frail as the bubble, which floats on the ſurface of the watery element.</p>
               <p>"Behold the diſconſolate and deſpiſed Flirtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la! and from her fate learn not to truſt in the effects or duration of this adventitious quality.</p>
               <p>"Early in life, Flirtilla was taught that her charms were irreſiſtible; that ſhe might aſpire to an abſolute aſcendency<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> over the hearts and paſſions of her votaries. A ſuperficial, but faſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ionable education added the allurements of art to thoſe of perſon, and rendered her a finiſhed coquette.</p>
               <p>"Her beauty and the gaiety of her manners gained her numerous admirers, who ſwarmed around, like the inſect tribe, eager to ſip the
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:033748_0051_0FF928BCE3503CC8"/>
fragrance of the equally fair and fading roſe. The incenſe of flattery, in every form, was her tribute.</p>
               <p>"Elated by this, ſhe gave free ſcope to her ruling paſſions, the love of pleaſure and diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Her beſt days were ſpent in the chaſe of vanity; and ſhe culled the flowers of life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſidering, that ſubſtantial fruit would be required at a more advanced period, as a ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute for the fading bloſſoms of youth. Her mind was barren of improvement, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently deſtitute of reſources.</p>
               <p>"She vainly imagined the triumphs of beauty to be permanent, till its declared enemy, the ſmall-pox, convinced her of the egregious miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take. By this ſhe found her empire ſuddenly overturned. The mercileſs diſorder had reduced her to a level with the generality of her ſex, in appearance, and, in enjoyment, far below them. Her glaſs faithfully repreſented this inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reduction. Regret and chagrin heightened the apparent calamity. She was remembered only as the contraſt of what ſhe once had been. Her lovers were diſguſted with the change, and ſought more pleaſing objects of attention; while men of ſentiment could not find a ſimilarity of diſpoſition, in her, to induce a connexion.</p>
               <p>"Her female acquaintance, who had envied her as a rival, or feared her as a ſuperior, now inſulted her with their pity, or mortified her
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:033748_0052_0FF928C108245DA8"/>
by remarks on the ſurpriſing alteration in her appearance.</p>
               <p>"Finding no alleviation from ſociety, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired from the world to nurſe, in ſolitude, the vexation and diſappointment ſhe experienced.</p>
               <p>"View her now, peeviſh, diſcontented, and gloomy! Her ideas of pleaſure were centered in that perſon, which is now neglected; in thoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments which have now forſaken her forever!</p>
               <p>"Thought ſhe ſtudiouſly ſhuns; for ſhe has nothing pleaſing to occupy her reflections, but what is irretrievably loſt!</p>
               <p>"Miſerable Flirtilla! thou truſtedſt in vanity, and vanity is thy recompenſe! How happy mighteſt thou have been, even in this change, if thy heart had been rectified, thy underſtanding improved, and thy mind liberally ſtored with uſeful ſentiments, knowledge, and information!</p>
               <p>"Cultivate, then, my young friends, thoſe diſpoſitions and attainments, which will yield permanent and real ſatisfaction, when ſickneſs, adverſity, or age ſhall have robbed your eyes of their luſtre, and diminiſhed the bloom and ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of your forms.</p>
               <p>"You are doubtleſs ſenſible that your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in life, does not depend ſo much on your external, as your internal graces.</p>
               <p>"The conſtitutional temper of your minds was given you by nature; but reaſon is added for its regulation.</p>
               <l>
                  <pb n="55" facs="unknown:033748_0053_0FF928C526CD3A40"/>
"On life's vaſt ocean diverſely we ſail;</l>
               <l>Reaſon the chart; but paſſion is the gale."</l>
               <p>"Our paſſions were certainly implanted for wiſe and benevolent purpoſes; and, if properly directed, may be of great utility. This direction nature will teach, and education improve. To their precepts we muſt implicitly liſten, if we would become reſpectable or contented.</p>
               <p>"Examine yourſelves, therefore, with impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ſcrutiny. Find out your particular faults in this reſpect, and exert your unwearied induſtry to amend them.</p>
               <p>"Poſſibly you may be naturally haſty, paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, or vindictive. If ſo, how wretched, at times, muſt the indulgence of this temper render you! When reaſon, awhile ſuſpended, reſumes its empire, and calm reflection ſucceeds the riot of paſſion, how ſevere muſt be your ſelf-condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and how keen your ſenſations of regret! Perhaps an unkindneſs of expreſſion to ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular friend, diſreſpectful treatment of an hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ored ſuperior, ill-timed reſentment to a beloved equal, or imperious and unbecoming ſeverity to a deſerving inferior, may give you the moſt pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful emotions, and degrade you in your own, as well as in the eſtimation of every obſerver! To prevent this evil, accuſtom yourſelves to check the firſt riſings of anger, and ſuſpend every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of diſpleaſure, till you can deliberate on the provocation, and the propriety of noticing
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:033748_0054_0FF928C951EF00E0"/>
it. It may have been undeſigned, and, therefore, not juſtly provoking. You may have miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the word, or action of offence, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry may remove the grounds of your ſuſpicion: or the perſon offending may be one with whom prudence and honor require you not to enter the liſts. But if neither of theſe conſiderations oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, reflect a moment, that your own reputation and conſequent happineſs are at ſtake; and that to loſe the command of yourſelves and your paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions is inconſiſtent with the delicacy of ladies, the moderation of chriſtians, and the dignity of rational beings.</p>
               <p>"Let every ſally alarm, and excite you to ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and new-diſcipline your forces; and to be more ſtrictly on your guard againſt the aſſaults of your foe.</p>
               <p>"The character of Camilla is a pattern wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of your imitation. While very young, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milla was unfortunately deprived of the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and regulating hand of a diſcreet and judicious mother. Her father was too much immerſed in buſineſs to attend to the cultivation of his daughter's mind.</p>
               <p>"He gave her the means of a genteel educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, praiſed her excellencies, and chid her faults, without being at the pains of teaching her how to amend them. The irritability of her temper he rather indulged, conſidering her as a girl of <hi>ſpirit,</hi> who would make her way in the
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:033748_0055_0FF8C61D2897B170"/>
world, in ſpite of obſtacles. She was naturally generous, tender-hearted, and humane; but her temper was as uncontrollable as the whirlpool, and as impetuous as the wind. Happily for her, ſhe had an uncommon ſtrength of mind, a ready apprehenſion, a quick perception, and a depth of underſtanding, ſeldom equalled. She ſaw her errors, was conſcious of her failings, and a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere ſufferer for her faults. But ſuch was the extreme quickneſs of her feelings, and ſo paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate her reſentment of any thing which appeared injurious or affrontive, that ſhe could not always repreſs them. She married a gentleman of a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilar temper, and of equal prudence. In the union of ſuch violent ſpirits, great harmony could not be preſaged. Their paſſions were lively, their affections ardent.</p>
               <l>"The honey-moon in raptures flew,</l>
               <l>A ſecond brought its tranſports too;</l>
               <l>The third, the fourth, were not amiſs;</l>
               <l>The fifth was friendſhip, mix'd with bliſs:</l>
               <l>But ere a twelvemonth paſs'd away,</l>
               <l>They found each other made of clay."</l>
               <p>"Inadvertencies gave offence; frequent alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations aroſe; both were tenacious of their rights, and averſe to condeſcenſion. Camilla ſaw the impending danger; ſhe became ſenſible that the happineſs of her life depended on amendment and caution; ſhe reſolved to avoid
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:033748_0056_0FF928CF19453D00"/>
giving or taking offence, with the greateſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; to ſuppreſs every emotion of anger; and when ſhe thought herſelf injured, to retire, or be ſilent, till paſſion had ſubſided, and ſhe could regain her calmneſs.</p>
               <p>"This was a hard taſk, at firſt; but perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance rendered it effectual to a thorough refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in each.</p>
               <p>"Her example and pathetic admonitions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced her huſband to adopt her prudent plan. They found their mutual endeavours productive of real ſatisfaction, and happineſs the reward of their exertions to ſecure it.</p>
               <p>"To be vindictive is equally, perhaps more fatal to our own, and the peace of others, than to be paſſionate. Violent paſſions of all kinds are generally tranſient; but revenge is the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of malice, the parent of diſcord, and the bane of ſocial love. It is an evidence of a weak and ſickly mind. True greatneſs will riſe ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to this ignoble ſpirit, ſo peculiarly ungrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in a lady, and inconſiſtent with that delicacy and ſoftneſs, which ought ever to characterize the ſex.</p>
               <p>"But an envious temper is, of all others, the moſt degrading and miſerable. Envy is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant poiſon, which rankles in the heart, and deſtroys the inward peace; even while there is an outward appearance of ſerenity. That mind, which cannot rejoice in the happineſs of others,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:033748_0057_0FF928D3F4EBA738"/>
is capable of very little in itſelf. To look with a grudging and evil eye on the enjoyments of our neighbour, muſt be a ſource of perpetual chagrin and mortification.</p>
               <p>"Envy indulged, is a puniſhment to its poſſeſſor. Eradicate, then, the firſt, and every emotion of ſo corroding and deſtructive a nature; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to excel only by that virtuous emulation, which is productive of improvement and reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability.</p>
               <p>"A kind, compaſſionate, benevolent, humane diſpoſition is an invaluable treaſure. It will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you bleſſings to ſociety, and objects of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal eſteem.</p>
               <l>"In <hi>you</hi> 'tis graceful to diſſolve at woe;</l>
               <l>With every motion, every word, to wave</l>
               <l>Quick o'er the kindling cheek the ready bluſh;</l>
               <l>And from the ſmalleſt violence to ſhrink,"—</l>
               <p>"This amiable temper, however, may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times degenerate into weakneſs.</p>
               <p>"Prudence ſhould be exerciſed, even in the indulgence of the moſt engaging qualities. In the progreſs of life, occaſions may call for that reſolution and fortitude, which admit not of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent ſoftneſs; but ſuch occaſions very ſeldom occur.</p>
               <p>"How alluring are the charms of ſympathy and charity! Happy are they who always feel the

               <head>Wednesday, P. M. DRESS.</head>
               <p>"DRESS" continued Mrs. Williams to her re-aſſembled and attentive pupils, "is an important article of female economy. By ſome it is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs conſidered as too eſſential. This is always the caſe, when it becomes the ruling paſſion, and every other excellence is made ſubordinate to it. A ſuitable attention to the etiquette of appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is neceſſary to render us reſpectable in the eyes of the world; and diſcovers an accommodat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſpoſition, which is, at once, engaging and uſeful in the commerce of ſociety. Females are taxed with being peculiarly attached to, and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated by the glare of ſplendor and ſhow. But I believe ſuperficial minds are not confined to ſex. Whatever form they actuate, to beautify and adorn it will be the principal object.</p>
               <p>"A certain ſpecies of gaiety and airineſs is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming in youth. Young ladies, therefore, act perfectly in character, when, under proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, they indulge their taſte in the decora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their perſons. But they ſhould be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially careful that their taſte be correct; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the modeſt delicacy which is the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and ornament of woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="unknown:033748_0060_0FF928E1B6EB5B50"/>"It is laudable to follow faſhions, ſo far as they are governed by theſe rules; but whenever they deviate, quit them with expreſs diſapproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diſguſt. Any aſſumptions of the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine habit are unbecoming. Dreſs and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſhould be correſpondent; and the engaging ſoftneſs and artleſs ſimplicity, which grace my pupils, muſt be quite inconſiſtent with the air and attire of the other ſex.</p>
               <p>"A gaudy and fantaſtical mode of decoration is by no means a recommendation. It beſpeaks a lightneſs of mind and a vanity of diſpoſition, againſt which a diſcreet and modeſt girl ſhould guard with the utmoſt vigilance. Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance is a great error, even where fortune will allow the means of ſupporting it. Many are the claims which the children of affliction and want have upon the ſuperfluous plenty of the rich. How much better expended would ſome part of their redundance be, in relieving the neceſſities of ſuch, than in decorating their own perſons, with every ornament which art can contrive to create expenſe!</p>
               <p>"Neatneſs and propriety ſhould be the main objects; for lovelineſs needs no foreign aid to give it a paſſport. Neatneſs is too often connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the idea of a prudiſh ſingularity; but no gaudineſs of apparel, no richneſs of attire, no modiſhneſs of appearance can be an equivalent for it. Propriety is that garb which becomes our
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:033748_0061_0FF928E7703B32D0"/>
ſituation and circumſtances in life. There cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ought to be a difference between different ages and conditions, in this reſpect. Many arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, ornamental to Miſs in her teens, would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear abſurd, fantaſtical, and ridiculous in maturer years. Neither ſhould the matronal robes, and the cloſe cap hide the natural ringlets, and eaſy ſhapes of the blooming girl.</p>
               <p>"It is a very falſe taſte which induces people in dependent and narrow circumſtances, to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the expenſive mode of dreſs which might be very decent for thoſe who move in a higher ſphere.</p>
               <p>"To endeavour to conceal indigence by the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of extravagance, is committing a great offence, both againſt ourſelves, and the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to which we belong. The means of ſupport ſhould always be attended to. A conformity to theſe will render you more reſpected for prudence, than a deviation for the ſake of ſhow without ſubſtance, can make you admired.</p>
               <p>"Louiſa and Clarinda are ſtriking examples. They were both the daughters of reputable pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, whoſe ſituations in the world were eaſy and comfortable, though not affluent. They were able to give their children a good education, but no other portion. Gay, volatile, and ambitious, Louiſa was the votary of faſhion. A ſuperior in dreſs excited the keeneſt ſenſations of envy in her boſom; and a rival in appearance gave
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:033748_0062_0FF8C6185769AAE8"/>
her unſpeakable mortification. Diſſatisfied with her natural charms, coſmetics and paints added to her expenſes, and betrayed her folly. She had many profeſſed admirers, who found her a willing dupe to flattery, and who raiſed her vanity by praiſing her excellent taſte.</p>
               <p>"Leander, a gentleman of liberal education, ſuperior merit, and handſome property, caſt his eye around for a companion to ſhare and enjoy theſe advantages with him. Louiſa caught his attention. The elegance of her perſon, and ſplendor of her appearance, charmed his imagination, and inſpired the idea of a fortune ſufficient to ſupport her expenſive ſtyle of living. He paid his addreſſes, and was received with the moſt flattering encouragement. But how great was his diſappointment, when he diſcovered the ſmallneſs of her reſources, and the impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of her management! This, ſaid he to himſelf, will never do for me. Were my income far ſuperior to what it is, it would not be ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to ſuch unbounded extravagance. Beſides, where ſo little economy is practiſed, while under parental government, what muſt be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of that unlimited indulgence, which the confidence due to a wife demands? Were I to abridge her expenſes, and endeavour to rectify her fantaſtical taſte, it would doubtleſs foment diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſion, diſcord, and animoſity, which muſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:033748_0063_0FF928EC7A766288"/>
in wretchedneſs. He reſolved, however, to try her real diſpoſition, by gently hinting his diſapprobation of her gaiety. This ſhe reſented; and a rupture, which ended in a final ſeparation, enſued. She found, too late, the value of the man, whom ſhe had ſlighted; and ever after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretted that folly which had irretrievably alien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated his affections.</p>
               <p>"The modeſty and neatneſs of Clarinda's garb next caught Leander's eye. Converſing with her on the ſubject of dreſs, the juſtneſs of her ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments gave him the higheſt ideas of the rectitude and innocence of her mind. A coſtly article was offered for her purchaſe; but ſhe refuſed it. It would not become me, ſaid ſhe, nor any other perſon who has not an affluent fortune. If I had a ſufficiency to buy it, I would procure ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more ſimple and neceſſary for myſelf; and the overplus might render an object of diſtreſs contented and happy.</p>
               <p>"Yet was Clarinda always elegantly neat; always genteelly faſhionable. Frugality and econ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omy, free from profuſion and extravagance, ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled her to indulge her own taſte entirely; and while ſhe enjoyed that, ſhe repined not at the fancied ſuperiority of others. Leander found her all he wiſhed, in appearance; all he hoped for, in reality. As their taſtes were correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and their higheſt aim, when united, to pleaſe
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:033748_0064_0FF928F232C79A70"/>
each other, they were not dependent on the breath of faſhion for their happineſs. A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with its forms did not elate their pride, nor a departure from them, fill their hearts with peeviſhneſs and diſcontent."</p>

               <head>Thursday, A. M. POLITENESS.</head>
               <p>"STILL more important than your habit, is your air and deportment. It is not ſufficient that theſe are pleaſing to the eye of the ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial obſerver. Your behaviour and converſation muſt be uniformly governed by the laws of politeneſs, diſcretion, and decorum. Elſe you will be diſguſting to people of refinement; and the judicious and diſcerning will diſcover the weakneſs of your minds, notwithſtanding the ſhowy ornaments, intended to conceal it from public view.</p>
               <p>"Inattention in company is a breach of good manners. Indeed, it is a downright inſult; being neither more nor leſs, than declaring that you have not the leaſt reſpect for any who are preſent. Either you do not value their good opinion, or you have ſomething more important than their converſation to occupy your minds.</p>
               <p>"You ſhould always be attentive to thoſe with whom you are converſant, let their rank and ſtanding be what they may. Your ſuperiors will eſteem you for your reſpectful treatment of them; your equals will love you for your kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:033748_0066_0FF929074FBC59D0"/>
and familiarity; your inferiors will reſpect you for your condeſcenſion and meekneſs.</p>
               <p>"Attention in company will be advantageous to yourſelves. Like the induſtrious bee, which ſips honey from every plant, you may derive ſome benefit or inſtruction from all kinds of ſociety. Some uſeful remark or information; ſome ſentiment which may allure you to the practice of virtue, or deter you from a vicious perpetration, may repay your labour, and be ſerviceable through life.</p>
               <p>"But ſhould there be no other motive than that of pleaſing your aſſociates, and rendering them happy, by making yourſelves agreeable, it may be conſidered as a ſufficient inducement to the practice of this branch of good-breeding. Many girls, in the thoughtleſs levity of their hearts, divert themſelves at the expenſe of others; and, with the utmoſt glee, point out any thing pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar in the appearance, words, or actions of ſome one in the company, whom they ſelect for a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of merriment and ridicule. This, by ſhrewd looks, ironical geſtures, or tittering whiſpers, is kept up, to the great mortification of the unhappy victim, and to the reproach and diſhonor of the offenders. Such conduct is a breach, not only of the rules of common civility, but of humanity; beſides being directly repugnant to the precept of doing to others as we would that they ſhould do to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="unknown:033748_0067_0FF9290AE2906768"/>"Be particularly careful, then, not to mortify, or give pain to an inferior.</p>
               <p>"Let the queſtion, "who maketh thee to differ?" ſuppreſs every emotion of ridicule, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, or neglect; and induce you to raiſe and encourage depreſſed merit by your notice and approbation.</p>
               <p>"As far as propriety, delicacy, and virtue will allow, conform to the taſte, and participate in the amuſements and converſation of the company into which you have fallen. If they be diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to you, avoid a ſupercilious avowal of your diſlike. This, inſtead of reforming, would prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably give them a diſguſt to you, and perhaps ſubject you to affronts. Yet where a diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating word or hint may be ſeaſonable, neglect not the opportunity of contributing to their ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efit and amendment.</p>
               <p>"Are you conſcious of ſuperior advantages, either mental or external, make no oſtentatious diſplay of them. Vanity too often leads young ladies to obtrude their acquirements on the eyes of obſervers, inconſiderately apprehending they may otherwiſe be unnoticed. Such forwardneſs always ſubjects them to cenſure, ridicule, and envy; the expreſſions of which deſtroy that ſelf-approbation which retiring merit invariably enjoys. However, exert that dignity of virtue which will render you independent of caprice, calumny, and unprovoked ſatire.</p>

               <p>"If you diſlike them, avoid them in future. If you witneſs errors, faults, or improprieties, conceal, or at leaſt extenuate them, as much as poſſible.</p>
               <p>"Make juſt allowances for thoſe who may differ from you in opinion; and be cautious never to miſrepreſent, or circulate what appears amiſs to you, and muſt, if expoſed, be injurious to others. Charity hides a multitude of faults. Certainly then, charity will never aggravate nor create them.</p>
               <p>"To give currency to a report, which tends to the diſadvantage and diſhonor of another, is defaming; and defamation is a ſpecies of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, which can never be expiated.</p>

               <p>"Independent in fortune; ſtill more ſo in mind, calumny gave her no pain, while ſhe was conſcious of the rectitude of her intentions.</p>

                  <pb n="71" facs="unknown:033748_0069_0FF929124FB8B820"/>"Leontine was a gentleman of property; agreeable in his perſon and manners; of ſtrict honor, and extremely tenacious of it; but of a ſevere and unforgiving temper. He paid his addreſſes to Eudocia; was accepted, approved, and beloved. Yet, though he had gained her affections, he had not ſufficient influence to regulate her conduct, and repreſs her gaiety. Her fondneſs for ſhow and gallantry, in ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, induced her to countenance the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and receive the flattery, of men, whoſe characters were exceptionable, in Leontine's eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation. He remonſtrated againſt her impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and gave her his ideas of female delicacy. She laughed at his gravity, and rallied him on his implicit ſubjection to the opinions of others.</p>
               <p>"Towards the cloſe of a fine day, Eudocia rambled along a retired road, to enjoy the air. She was alone; but the hope of meeting her beloved Leontine, whom ſhe expected that even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, imperceptibly led her beyond her intended excurſion. The rattling of a carriage cauſed her to ſtop; and, thinking it to be Leontine's, ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached it before ſhe perceived her miſtake. A gentleman of an elegant appearance alighted, and accoſting her politely, expreſſed his ſurpriſe at finding her ſo far from home without an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant. She found it was Florio, with whom ſhe had a ſlight acquaintance, having once met with him in company. She frankly owned her
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:033748_0070_0FF929284EC8F150"/>
motive for walking thus far; and refuſed his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation to return in his carriage. He renewed his requeſt; and his importunity, ſeconded by her fatigue, at laſt prevailed. At this moment the detracting Lavina paſſed by. She ſaw Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docia, and with a ſneering ſmile, wiſhed her a good night. Eudocia was unconſcious of fault, and therefore fearleſs of cenſure. But the art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Florio, deſirous of protracting the pleaſure of her company, took a circuitous route, which conſiderably increaſed the diſtance to her father's houſe. However, he conveyed her ſafely home, though not ſo ſoon as ſhe wiſhed. She found that Leontine had been there, and had gone to viſit a friend; but would ſoon return. Leon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine was juſt ſeated at his friend's, when Lavina entered.</p>
               <p>"She told the circle, that Florio had juſt paſſed her, and that he had company ſhe little expected to ſee with him. They inquired if it was his former miſtreſs? No, ſaid ſhe, he has diſcarded her ſome time ago, and if we may judge by appearances, has choſen a new one. Upon being aſked who, ſhe preſumed to name Eudocia. Every countenance expreſſed ſurpriſe and regret. In Leontine's, rage and reſentment were viſibly depicted. He roſe, and ſtepping haſtily to Lavina, told her he was a party con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and demanded an explanation of what ſhe had inſinuated. She perceived that ſhe had
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:033748_0071_0FF92942D0B008A0"/>
given offence, and endeavoured to excuſe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but he reſolutely told her that no evaſions would avail; that he inſiſted on the real truth of her ſcandalous report. Finding him thus deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, ſhe related the ſimple fact of ſeeing Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docia in a carriage with Florio, who was a known libertine, and accuſtomed to the ſociety of looſe women. Leontine aſked her how ſhe came to aſſociate the ideas ſhe had mentioned with Eudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia's name? She replied that the lightneſs of her behaviour had ſometimes rendered her cenſurable; and ſhe thought this inſtance, in particular, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized ſuſpicion. Leontine could not deny that ſhe was culpable in appearance; yet made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that though ſcandal might feaſt on the failings of virtue, he believed Eudocia's inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence much purer, and her heart much better than her detracters'; and, taking his hat, he wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the company a good evening, and left them.</p>
               <p>"His paſſions were on fire. He could not comprehend the myſterious conduct of Eudocia. Her abſence from home, at a time when he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected her to receive him, and her being ſeen at a diſtance, in company with a profeſſed deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auchee, were a labyrinth which he could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore. Though he doubted not Eudocia's honor, yet her folly and imprudence, in ſubjecting her character to ſuſpicion and reproach, he thought unpardonable. His reſentment determined him to break the propoſed connexion immediately;
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:033748_0072_0FF9296138172180"/>
and, leſt his love ſhould get the better of his reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olution, he went directly to the houſe.</p>
               <p>"As he could not command his temper, he appeared extremely agitated, and angrily told Eudocia that ſhe had cauſed him great uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and that he came to claim the ſatisfaction of knowing, why ſhe had avoided his ſociety, and made an aſſignation with a man who had involved her in infamy? Eudocia was aſtoniſhed, and juſtly offended at this addreſs. With all the dignity of conſcious innocence, ſhe replied, that as yet he had no right to challenge an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of her conduct; but for her own ſake, ſhe would condeſcend to give it. This ſhe did, by a faithful and undiſguiſed relation of facts. She then aſked him, if he was ſatisfied. He anſwered, No. For, ſaid he, though you have cleared yourſelf of guilt, in my apprehenſion, you will find it very difficult to free your char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter from the blemiſh it has received in the opinion of the world. Saying this, he told her, that, however highly he eſteemed her, ſo oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite were their diſpoſitions, that they muſt often be at variance; and ſo nice was his ſenſe of honor, that his wife, like Caeſar's, muſt not only be virtuous, but unſuſpected. She rejoined, that his ſentiments were apparent; and if what he then expreſſed were his opinion of her, it was beſt they ſhould part.</p>

               <p>"The impropriety of her conduct, and her loſing the affections of a man ſhe too ardently loved, together with the cruel treatment ſhe had juſt received from him, overwhelmed her with grief, and produced the moſt violent emotions of regret. She walked her room in all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of diſappointed hope. Her parents uſed every argument to ſoothe and conſole her; but in vain.</p>
               <p>"She yielded to their perſuaſions ſo far as to retire to bed; but reſt ſhe found not; and the morning preſented her in a burning fever. Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ontine called in the courſe of the day; but the friends of Eudocia refuſed to ſee him. An ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of her diſorder had rouſed him to a ſenſe of his raſhneſs, and he begged to be admitted to her chamber; but this ſhe utterly denied.</p>
               <p>"Her fever left her; but the diſeaſe of her mind was beyond the power of medicine. A ſettled melancholy ſtill remains; and ſhe lives the victim of calumniation!</p>
               <p>"To detract from the merit of others, beſide the want of politeneſs which it betrays, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the injuries which it always occaſions, is extremely impolitic.

At that time ſhe was at nurſe in a neighbouring village; between which and the metropolis, all communication being cut off, he was reduced to the neceſſity of leaving her to the mercy of thoſe to whom ſhe was entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Having received her from pecuniary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives only, they no ſooner found themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the profits of their labour and care, than they ſought relief by an application to the town for her ſupport. A wealthy farmer in the vicinity, who had often ſeen and been pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the dawning charms of Flavia, pitied her condition; and having no children of his own, reſolved to ſhelter her from the impending ſtorm, till ſhe could be better provided for. At his houſe, ſhe was brought up in a homely, though comfortable manner. The good man and his wife were exceſſively fond of her, and gave her every inſtruction and advantage in their power. Plain truths were liberally inculcated, and every exertion made to give her a habit of induſtry and good nature. Flavia requited their kindneſs by an obliging and cheerful, a docile and ſubmiſſive deportment. As ſhe advanced in years, ſhe increaſed in beauty. Her amiable diſpoſition rendered her beloved, and her perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al accompliſhments made her admired by all the

He ſought, and found her; and though ſenſible of his obligations to her foſter-parents for ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her from want and diſtreſs, ſtill he could not prevail on himſelf to make ſo great a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to gratitude as they wiſhed, by permitting his daughter to ſpend her days in obſcurity. The lively fancy of Flavia was allured by the ſplendid promiſes and deſcriptions of her father; and ſhe readily conſented to leave the friends of her childhood and youth, and explore the walks of faſhionable life.</p>
               <p>"When ſhe arrived in town, what new ſcenes opened upon the dazzled eyes of the admiring, and admired Flavia!</p>
               <p>"Wealth, with its attendant train of ſplendid forms and ceremonies, courted her attention, and every ſpecies of diſſipating amuſement, ſanction<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the name of pleaſure, beguiled the hours
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:033748_0080_0FF92A1BA57EE468"/>
and charmed the imagination of the noviciate. Each enchanting ſcene ſhe painted to herſelf in the brighteſt colours; and her inexperienced heart promiſed her happineſs without allay. Flattery gave her a thouſand charms which ſhe was hitherto inconſcious of poſſeſſing, and the obſequiouſneſs of the gaudy train around raiſed her vanity to the higheſt pitch of arrogance and pride. Behold Flavia, now, launched into the whirlpool of faſhionable folly! Balls, plays, cards, and parties engroſs every portion of her time.</p>
               <p>"Her father ſaw, too late, the imprudence of his unbounded indulgence; and his egregious miſtake, in ſo immediately reverſing her mode of life, without firſt furniſhing her mind with ſufficient knowledge and ſtrength to repel temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. He endeavoured to regulate and reſtrain her conduct; but in vain. She complained of this, as an abridgment of her liberty, and took advantage of his doating fondneſs to practiſe every exceſs. Involved in expenſes (of which loſſes at play compoſed a conſiderable part) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond her power to defray, in this embarraſſing dilemma, ſhe was reduced to the neceſſity of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the treacherous offer of Marius to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance money for the ſupport of her extravagance. Obligated by his apparent kindneſs, ſhe could not refuſe the continuance of his acquaintance, till his deluſive arts had obtained the reward he
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:033748_0081_0FF92A38CE49DE10"/>
propoſed to himſelf, in the ſacrifice of her honor. At length ſhe awoke to a trembling ſenſe of her guilt, and found it fatal to her peace, reputation, and happineſs.</p>
               <p>"Wretched Flavia! no art could conceal thy ſhame! The grief of her mind, her retirement from company, and the alteration in her appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, betrayed her to her father's obſervation. Highly incenſed at the ingratitude and baſeneſs of her conduct, he refuſed to forgive her; but ſent her from the enſnaring pleaſures of the town, to languiſh out the remainder of life in ſolitude and obſcurity."</p>

               <p>"THE filial and fraternal are the firſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a ſingle ſtate. The obligations you are under to your parents cannot be diſcharged, but by a uniform and cheerful obedience; an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and ready compliance with their wiſhes, added to the moſt diligent attention to their eaſe and happineſs. The virtuous and affectionate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of children is the beſt compenſation, in their power, for that unwearied care and ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude which parents, only, know. Upon daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whoſe ſituation and employments lead them more frequently into ſcenes of domeſtic tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; who are often called to ſmooth the pillow of ſick and aged parents, and to adminiſter with a ſkilful and delicate hand the cordial, reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to decaying nature, an endearing ſenſibility, and a dutiful acquieſence in the diſpoſitions, and even peculiarities of thoſe from whom they have derived exiſtence, are indiſpenſably incumbent.</p>
               <p>"Such a conduct will yield a ſatisfaction of mind more than equivalent to any little ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:033748_0083_0FF92A569D653908"/>
of inclination or humour which may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at your hands.</p>
               <p>"Pope, among all his admired poetry, has not ſix lines more beautifully expreſſive than the following:</p>
               <l>"Me, let the pious office long engage,</l>
               <l>To rock the cradle of declining age;</l>
               <l>With lenient arts extend a mother's breath,</l>
               <l>Make languor ſmile, and ſmooth the bed of death;</l>
               <l>Explore the thought, explain the aſking eye,</l>
               <l>And keep awhile one parent from the ſky!"</l>
               <p>"Next in rank and importance to filial piety, is fraternal love. This is a natural affection which you cannot too aſſiduouſly cultivate. How de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to ſee children of the ſame family dwell together in unity; promoting each other's wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and emulous only to excel in acts of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and good will. Between brothers and ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the connexion is equally intimate and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing. There is ſuch a union of intereſts, and ſuch an undivided participation of enjoyments, that every ſenſible and feeling mind muſt value the bleſſings of family friendſhip and peace.</p>
               <p>"Strive, therefore, my dear pupils, to promote them, as objects which deſerve your particular at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; as attainments which will not fail rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reward your labour.</p>
               <p>"Prudelia, beſide other amiable endowments of perſon and mind, poſſeſſed the moſt lively ſenſibility, and ardent affections.</p>

                  <pb n="86" facs="unknown:033748_0084_0FF8C66E6B158E68"/>"The recommendations of her parents, united to her own wiſhes, had induced her to give her hand to Clodius, a gentleman of diſtinguiſhed merit. He was a foreigner; and his buſineſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired his return to his native country.</p>
               <p>"Prudelia bid a reluctant adieu to her friends, and embarked with him. She lived in affluence, and was admired and careſſed by all that knew her, while a lovely family was riſing around her. Yet theſe pleaſing circumſtances and proſpects could not extinguiſh or alienate that affection, which ſtill glowed in her breaſt for the natural guardians and companions of her childhood and youth.</p>
               <p>"With the deepeſt affliction ſhe heard the news of her father's death, and the embarraſſed ſituation in which he had left his affairs. She was impatient to conſole her widowed mother, and to miniſter to her neceſſities. For theſe purpoſes, the prevailed on her huſband to conſent that ſhe ſhould viſit her, though it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him to attend her. With all the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of dutiful zeal, ſhe flew to the arms of her bereaved parent. But how great was her aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment and grief, when told that her only ſiſter had been deluded by an affluent villain, and by his inſidious arts, ſeduced from her duty, her honor, and her home! The emotions of pity, indignation, regret, and affection, overwhelmed her, at firſt; but recollecting herſelf, and exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

all her fortitude, ſhe nobly reſolved, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to ſnatch the guilty, yet beloved Myra, from ruin, rather than revenge her injured family by abandoning her to the infamy ſhe deſerved. To this intent ſhe wrote her a pathetic letter, lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her elopement, but entreating her, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to return and receive her fraternal em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace. But Myra, conſcious of her crime, and unworthineſs of her ſiſter's condeſcenſion and kindneſs, and above all, dreading the ſuperiority of her virtue, refuſed the generous invitation. Prudelia was not thus to be vanquiſhed in her benevolent undertaking. She even followed her to her lodgings, and inſiſted on an interview. Here ſhe painted, in the moſt lively colours, the heinouſneſs of her offence, and the ignominy and wretchedneſs that awaited her. Her affection allured, her reaſoning convinced her backſliding ſiſter. Upon the promiſe of forgiveneſs from her mother, Myra conſented to leave her infamous paramour, and retrace the paths of rectitude and virtue.</p>
               <p>"Her ſeducer was abſent on a journey. She, therefore, wrote him a farewell letter, couched in terms of ſincere penitence for her tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and determined reſolution of amendment in future, and left the houſe. Thus reſtored and reconciled to her friends, Myra appeared in quite another character.</p>

               <head>Friday, P. M. FRIENDSHIP.</head>
               <p>"FRIENDSHIP is a term, much inſiſted on by young people; but, like many others, more frequently uſed than underſtood. A friend, with girls in general, is an intimate acquaintance, whoſe taſte and pleaſures are ſimilar to their own; who will encourage, or at leaſt connive at their foibles and faults, and communicate with them every ſecret; in particular thoſe of love and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, in which thoſe of the other ſex are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. By ſuch friends, their errors and ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems are flattered and concealed, while the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent advice of real friendſhip is neglected, till they find, too late, how fictitious a character, and how vain a dependence they have choſen.</p>
               <p>"Auguſta and Serena were educated at the ſame ſchool, reſided in the ſame neighbourhood, and were equally volatile in their tempers, and diſſipated in their manners. Hence every plan of amuſement was concerted and enjoyed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. At the play, the ball, the card-table, and every other party of pleaſure, they were companions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="unknown:033748_0088_0FF92A8C1F900C30"/>"Their parents ſaw that this intimacy ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened the follies of each; and ſtrove to diſengage their affections, that they might turn their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to more rational entertainments, and more judicious adviſers. But they gloried in their friendſhip, and thought it a ſubſtitute for every other virtue. They were the dupes of adulation, and the votaries of coquetry.</p>
               <p>"The attentions of a libertine, inſtead of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them on their guard againſt encroachments, induced them to triumph in their fancied con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, and to boaſt of reſolution ſufficient to ſhield them from deluſion.</p>
               <p>"Love, however, which, with ſuch diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is the pretty play-thing of imagination, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailed the tender heart of Serena. A gay youth, with more wit than ſenſe, more ſhow than ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, more art than honeſty, took advantage of her weakneſs to ingratiate himſelf into her favour, and perſuade her they could not live without each other. Auguſta was the confident of Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na. She fanned the flame, and encouraged her reſolution of promoting her own felicity, though at the expenſe of every other duty. Her parents ſuſpected her amour, remonſtrated againſt the man, and forbad her forming any connexion with him, on pain of their diſpleaſure. She ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently acquieſced; but flew to Auguſta for counſel and relief. Auguſta ſoothed her anxiety, and promiſed to aſſiſt her in the accompliſhment
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:033748_0089_0FF92A9C1522D7C8"/>
of all her wiſhes. She accordingly contrived means for a clandeſtine intercourſe, both perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and epiſtolary.</p>
               <p>"Ariſtus was a foreigner, and avowed his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of returning to his native country, urging her to accompany him. Serena had a fortune, independent of her parents, left her by a deceaſed relation. This, with her hand, ſhe conſented to give to her lover, and to quit a country, in which ſhe acknowledged but one friend. Auguſta praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her fortitude, and favoured her deſign. She accordingly eloped and embarked. Her parents were almoſt diſtracted by her imprudent and undutiful conduct; and their reſentment fell on Auguſta, who had acted contrary to all the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of integrity and friendſhip, in contributing to her ruin; for ruin it proved. Her ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful paramour, having rioted on the property which ſhe beſtowed, abandoned her to want and deſpair. She wrote to her parents, but received no anſwer. She repreſented her caſe to Auguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, and implored relief from her friendſhip; but Auguſta alleged that ſhe had already incurred the diſpleaſure of her family on her account, and choſe not again to ſubject herſelf to cenſure by the ſame means.</p>
               <p>"Serena at length returned to her native ſhore, and applied in perſon to Auguſta, who coolly told her that ſhe wiſhed no intercourſe with a vagabond, and then retired. Her parents refuſed
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:033748_0090_0FF92AA894EEBFD8"/>
to receive her into their houſe; but, from mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of compaſſion and charity, granted her a ſmall annuity, barely ſufficient to keep her and her infant from want.</p>
               <p>"Too late ſhe diſcovered her miſtaken notions of friendſhip; and learned by ſad experience, that virtue muſt be its foundation, or ſincerity and conſtancy can never be its reward.</p>
               <p>"Sincerity and conſtancy are eſſential ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients in virtuous friendſhip. It invariably ſeeks the permanent good of its object; and in ſo doing, will adviſe, caution and reprove, with all the frankneſs of undiſſembled affection. In the interchange of genuine friendſhip, flattery is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly excluded. Yet, even in the moſt intimate connexions of this kind, a proper degree of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, attention, and politeneſs, muſt be obſerved. You are not ſo far to preſume on the partiality of friendſhip, as to hazard giving offence, and wounding the feelings of perſons, merely becauſe you think their regard for you will plead your excuſe, and procure your pardon. Equally cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſhould you be, of taking umbrage at cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which are undeſignedly offenſive.</p>
               <p>"Hear the excellent advice of the wiſe ſon of Sirach, upon this ſubject:</p>
               <p>"Admoniſh thy friend; it may be he hath not done it; and if he have done it, that he do it no more. Admoniſh thy friend; it may be he hath not ſaid it; and if he have, that he
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:033748_0091_0FF8C681058F37C0"/>
ſpeak it not again. Admoniſh thy friend; for many times it is a ſlander; and believe not every tale. There is one that ſlippeth in his ſpeech, but not from his heart; and who is he that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth not with his tongue?"</p>
               <p>"Be not haſty in forming friendſhips; but deliberately examine the principles, diſpoſition, temper, and manners, of the perſon you wiſh to ſuſtain this important character. Be well aſſured that they are agreeable to your own, and ſuch as merit your entire eſteem and confidence, before you denominate her your friend. You may have many general acquaintances, with whom you are pleaſed and entertained; but in the chain of friendſhip there is a ſtill cloſer link.</p>
               <l>"Reſerve will wound it, and diſtruſt deſtroy.</l>
               <l>Deliberate on all things with thy friend:</l>
               <l>But ſince friends grow not thick on ev'ry bough,</l>
               <l>Nor ev'ry friend unrotten at the core,</l>
               <l>Firſt, on thy friend, deliberate with thyſelf:</l>
               <l>Pauſe, ponder, ſift; not eager in the choice,</l>
               <l>Nor jealous of the choſen: fixing, fix:</l>
               <l>Judge before friendſhip; then confide till death."</l>
               <p>"But, if you would have friends, you muſt ſhow yourſelves friendly; that is, you muſt be careful to act the part you wiſh from another. If your friend have faults, mildly and tenderly repreſent them to <hi>her</hi>; but conceal them as much as poſſible from the obſervation of the world. Endeavour to convince her of her errors, to
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:033748_0092_0FF92AC3124C0D30"/>
rectify her miſtakes, and to confirm and increaſe every virtuous ſentiment.</p>
               <p>"Should ſhe ſo far deviate, as to endanger her reputation and happineſs; and ſhould your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions fail to reclaim her, become not, like Auguſta, an abettor of her crimes. It is not the part of friendſhip to hide tranſactions which will end in the ruin of your friend. Rather acquaint thoſe who ought to have the rule over her of her intended miſteps, and you will have diſcharged your duty; you will merit, and very probably may afterwards receive, her thanks.</p>
               <p>"Narciſſa and Florinda were united in the bonds of true and generous friendſhip. Narciſſa was called to ſpend a few months with a relation in the metropolis, where ſhe became acquainted with, and attached to a man who was much her inferior; but whoſe ſpecious manners and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance deceived her youthful heart, though her reaſon and judgment informed her, that her parents would diſapprove the connexion. When ſhe returned home, the conſciouſneſs of her fault, the frankneſs which ſhe owed to her friend, and her partiality to her lover, wrought powerfully upon her mind, and rendered her melancholy. Florinda ſoon explored the cauſe, and warmly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated againſt her imprudence in holding a moment's intercourſe with a man, who, ſhe knew, would be diſpleaſing to her parents. She ſearched out his character, and found it far inadequate to
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:033748_0093_0FF92AC637547978"/>
Narciſſa's merit. This ſhe repreſented to her in its true colours, and conjured her not to ſacrifice her reputation, her duty, and her happineſs, by encouraging his addreſſes: but to no purpoſe were her expoſtulations. Narciſſa avowed the deſign of permitting him to ſolicit the conſent of her parents, and the determination of marrying him without it, if they refuſed.</p>
               <p>"Florinda was alarmed at this reſolution; and, with painful anxiety, ſaw the danger of her friend. She told her plainly, that the regard ſhe had for her demanded a counteraction of her deſign; and that if ſhe found no other way of preventing its execution, ſhe ſhould diſcharge her duty by informing her parents of her proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. This Narciſſa reſented, and immediately withdrew her confidence and familiarity; but the faithful Florinda neglected not the watchful ſolicitude of friendſhip; and when ſhe perceived that Narciſſa's family were reſolutely oppoſed to her projected match, and that Narciſſa was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to put her raſh purpoſe into execution, ſhe made known the plan which ſhe had concerted, and by that mean prevented her deſtruction. Narciſſa thought herſelf greatly injured, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that ſhe would never forgive ſo flagrant a breach of fidelity. Florinda endeavoured to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince her of her good intentions, and the real kindneſs of her motives; but ſhe refuſed to hear the voice of wiſdom, till a ſeparation from her
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:033748_0094_0FF8C5DD4C3D9B20"/>
lover, and a full proof of his unworthineſs, opened her eyes to a ſight of her own folly and indiſcretion, and to a lively ſenſe of Florinda's friendſhip, in ſaving her from ruin without her conſent. Her heart overflowed with gratitude to her generous preſerver. She acknowledged her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf indebted to Florinda's benevolence, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from the baneful impetuoſity of her own paſſions. She ſought and obtained forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and ever after lived in the ſtricteſt amity with her faithful benefactreſs."</p>

               <head>Saturday, A. M. LOVE.</head>
               <p>"THE higheſt ſtate of friendſhip which this life admits, is in the conjugal relation. On this refined affection, love, which is but a more intereſting and tender kind of friendſhip, ought to be founded. The ſame virtues, the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and qualities which are neceſſary in a friend, are ſtill more requiſite in a companion for life. And when theſe enlivening principles are united, they form the baſis of durable happineſs. But let not the maſk of friendſhip, or of love, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you. You are now entering upon a new ſtage of action, where you will probably admire, and be admired. You may attract the notice of many, who will ſelect you, as objects of adula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to diſcover their taſte and gallantry; and perhaps of ſome whoſe affections you have really and ſeriouſly engaged. The firſt claſs your pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etration will enable you to detect; and your good ſenſe and virtue will lead you to treat them with the neglect they deſerve. It is diſreputable for a young lady to receive and encourage the officious attentions of thoſe mere pleaſure-hunters, who
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:033748_0096_0FF92ACF5985C870"/>
rove from fair to fair, with no other deſign than the exerciſe of their art, addreſs, and intrigue. Nothing can render their company pleaſing, but a vanity of being careſſed, and a falſe pride in being thought an object of general admiration, with a fondneſs for flattery which beſpeaks a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated mind. But when you are addreſſed by a perſon of real merit, who is worthy your eſteem, and may juſtly demand your reſpect, let him be treated with honor, frankneſs, and ſincerity. It is the part of a prude, to affect a ſhyneſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and indifference, foreign to the heart. Innocence and virtue will riſe ſuperior to ſuch little arts, and indulge no wiſh which needs diſguiſe.</p>
               <p>"Still more unworthy are the inſidious and deluding wiles of the coquette. How diſguſting muſt this character appear to perſons of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and integrity! how unbecoming the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy and dignity of an uncorrupted female!</p>
               <p>"As you are young and inexperienced, your affections may poſſibly be involuntarily engaged, where prudence and duty forbid a connexion. Beware, then, how you admit the paſſion of love. In young minds, it is of all others the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controllable. When fancy takes the reins, it compels its blinded votary to ſacrifice reaſon, diſcretion and conſcience to its impetuous dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates. But a paſſion of this origin tends not to ſubſtantial and durable happineſs. To ſecure
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:033748_0097_0FF8C68B2A06BA60"/>
this, it muſt be quite of another kind, enkindled by eſteem, founded on merit, ſtrengthened by congenial diſpoſitions and correſponding virtues, and terminating in the moſt pure and refined affection.</p>
               <p>"Never ſuffer your eyes to be charmed by the mere exterior; nor delude yourſelves with the notion of unconquerable love. The eye, in this reſpect, is often deceptious, and fills the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation with charms which have no reality. Nip, in the bud, every particular liking, much more all ideas of love, till called forth by unequivocal tokens, as well as profeſſions of ſincere regard. Even then, harbour them not without a thorough knowledge of the temper, diſpoſition, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of your lover, the advice of your friends; and, above all, the approbation of your parents. Maturely weigh every conſideration for and againſt, and deliberately determine with yourſelves, what will be moſt conducive to your welfare and felicity in life. Let a rational and diſcreet plan of thinking and acting, regulate your deportment, and render you deſerving of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection you wiſh to inſure.

               <head>Saturday, P. M. RELIGION.</head>
               <p>"HAVING given you my ſentiments on a variety of ſubjects which demand your partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular attention, I come now to the cloſing and moſt important theme; and that is Religion. The virtuous education which you have received, and the good principles which have been inſtilled into your minds from infancy, will render the enforcement of Chriſtian precepts and duties a pleaſing leſſon.</p>
               <p>"Religion is to be conſidered as an eſſential and durable object; not as the embelliſhment of a day; but an acquiſition which ſhall endure and increaſe through the endleſs ages of eternity.</p>

"Remember now your Creator, in the days of your youth, while the evil days come not,

nor the years draw nigh, when you ſhall ſay, we have no pleaſure in them." If you wiſh for permanent happineſs, cultivate the divine favour as your higheſt enjoyment in life, and your ſafeſt retreat when death ſhall approach you.</p>
               <p>"That even the young are not exempt from the arreſt of this univerſal conqueror, the tomb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of Amelia will tell you. Youth, beauty, health and fortune, ſtrewed the path of life with flowers, and left her no wiſh ungratified. Love, with its gentleſt and pureſt flame, animated her heart, and was equally returned by Julius. Their paſſion was approved by their parents and friends; the day was fixed, and preparations were making for the celebration of their nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials. At this period, Amelia was attacked by a violent cold, which, ſeating on her lungs, baffled the ſkill of the moſt eminent phyſicians, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated in a confirmed hectic. She perceived her diſorder to be incurable, and with inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible regret and concern anticipated her approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſſolution. She had enjoyed life too highly to think much of death; yet die ſhe muſt! "Oh," ſaid ſhe, "that I had prepared, while in health and at eaſe, for this awful event! Then ſhould I not be ſubjected to the keeneſt diſtreſs of mind, in addition to the moſt painful infirmities of body! Then ſhould I be able to look forward with hope, and to find relief in the conſoling ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of being united, beyond the grave,

with thoſe dear and beloved connexions, which I muſt ſoon leave behind! Let my companions and acquaintance learn from me the important leſſon of improving their time to the beſt of purpoſes; of acting at once as becomes mortal and immortal creatures!"</p>

               <p>"Too many, eſpecially of the young and gay, ſeem more anxious to live in pleaſure, than to anſwer the end of their being by the cultivation of that piety and virtue which will render them good members of ſociety, uſeful to their friends and aſſociates, and partakers of that heart-felt ſatisfaction which reſults from a conſcience void of offence both towards God and man.</p>
               <p>"This, however, is an egregious miſtake; for in many ſituations, piety nd virtue are our only ſource of conſolation; and in all, they are pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly friendly to our happineſs.</p>

which can not only enſure reſpect from thoſe around you, but inſpire you with reſignation to the divine will, and a patient acquieſcence in the moſt painful allotments of a holy Providence? Does wealth await your command, and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur with its faſcinating appendages beguile your fleeting moments? Recollect, that riches often make themſelves wings and fly away. A ſingle inſtance of miſmanagement; a conſuming fire, with various other misfortunes which no human prudence can foreſee or prevent, may ſtrip you of this dependence; and, unleſs you have other grounds of comfort than earth can boaſt, reduce you to the moſt inſupportable wretchedneſs and deſpair. Are you ſurrounded by friends, and happy in the ſociety of thoſe who are near and dear to you? Soon may they be wreſted from your fond embrace, and conſigned to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the dead!</p>
               <p>"Whence, then, will you derive ſupport, if unacquainted with that divine Friend, who will never fail nor forſake you; who is the ſame yeſterday, to-day, and forever?</p>
               <p>"Health and youth, my dear girls, are the ſeaſons for improvement. Now you may lay up a treaſure which neither ſickneſs nor adverſity can impair.</p>
               <p>"But the hour of diſtreſs is not the only time, in which religion will be advantageous to you. Even in proſperity, it will prove the beſt ſolace,

By correcting your paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, it will improve your joys, endear you to your friends and connexions, and render you contented, happy, and uſeful in every ſtage and condition of life.</p>
               <p>Religion will not deprive you of temporal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments; it will heighten and increaſe them. It will not depreſs, but exhilarate your ſpirits. For it conſiſts not in a gloomy, miſanthropic temper, declining the ſocial and innocent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of life; but prepares the mind to partake with ſatisfaction of every pleaſure which reaſon approves, and which can yield ſerenity and peace in the review. Be not aſhamed then of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing religious, and of riſing by that mean above the vain, unthinking crowd.</p>
               <p>"Let not the idle jeſts of heedleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>principled companions deter you from a ſtedfaſt adherence to the path of truth and righteouſneſs.

Stately domes, crowded ſtreets, rattling carriages, and all the noiſe and confuſion of a commercial city were ſubſtituted.

I told her no; that the wiſh to preſerve my health had called me up two hours before. Well, rejoined ſhe, you will not find any body to keep you company here, for two hours to come. I was chagrined at the information, and aſked her for a bowl of milk, it being paſt my uſual breakfaſt time. The milk man had juſt arrived, and I drank ſome; but it had loſt its flavour on the road. It was not like that which was ſerved us at Harmony-Grove. I ſtepped to the harpſichord, and having ſung and played a morning hymn, returned to my chamber, where, taking my work, I ſat down by the window to view the liſtleſs tribe of yawning mortals who were beginning to thicken in the ſtreets. One half of theſe appeared to be dragged forth by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, rather than any inclination to enjoy the beauties of a fine morning.</p>
               <p>At nine, I was ſummoned into the parlour to breakfaſt. My ſiſters gently chid me for diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their repoſe with my muſic. I excuſed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by alleging that I had been ſo long accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:033748_0115_0FF92BC6B62C8BA8"/>
to early riſing that I ſhould find it difficult to alter the habit.</p>
               <p>Here, madam, you have an account of my firſt night and morning's occupation. Were I to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with every new occurrence, through the year, and ſubjoin my own remarks, I muſt write volumes inſtead of letters.</p>

               <p>A line from Harmony-Grove would be a lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury to me.</p>

               <p>I DID not intend, when we parted at the boarding ſchool, that a whole month ſhould have elapſed without bearing you ſome teſtimony of my continued friendſhip and affection; but ſo numerous have been my avocations, and ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious my engagements, that I have ſcarcely call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a moment my own ſince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I returned home. Having been from town a year, I was conſidered as too antique to appear in company abroad, till I had been perfectly metamorphoſed. Every part of my habit has undergone a complete change, in conformity to the preſent faſhion. It was with extreme regret that I parted with the neatneſs and ſimplicity of my country dreſs; which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my ideas of modeſty, was more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming. But, I truſt, this alteration of appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance will have no tendency to alienate thoſe ſentiments from my heart, which I imbibed under the tuition of Mrs. Williams.</p>
               <p>I went, laſt evening, to the aſſembly; but though dazzled, I was by no means charmed, by the glare of finery and tinſelled decorations that were diſplayed.</p>
               <p>There were ſome ladies, whoſe gentility and faſhionable dreſs were evidently the product of
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:033748_0117_0FF92B88EB174FA0"/>
a correct taſte; but others were ſo diſguiſed by tawdry gewgaws, as to diſguſt me exceedingly.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Williams uſed to ſay, that the dreſs was indicative of the mind. If this obſervation be juſt, what opinion am I to form of the gay mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes who trip along the ſtreets, and throng the places of public reſort in this metropolis; the lightneſs and gaudineſs of whoſe appearance, beſpeak a ſickly taſte, to ſay no more!</p>
               <p>I am furniſhed with feathers, flowers, and ribbons, in profuſion. I ſhall, however, uſe them very ſparingly; and though I would not be entirely ſingular, yet I <hi>muſt</hi> inſiſt on conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my own fancy a little, and cannot willingly ſacrifice my own opinion to the capricious whims of faſhion, and her devotees. My aunt Laurence, who, you know, is extravagantly genteel, is making us a viſit. She laughs very heartily at my ſilly notions, as ſhe calls them, and ſtyles me a novice in the ways of the world; but hopes, notwithſtanding, that I ſhall acquire a better taſte, when I am more acquainted with faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able life. That I may be much improved by a more extenſive knowledge of the world, I doubt not; yet may I never be corrupted by that levity and folly, which are too prevalent among a part of my ſex.</p>
               <p>I will not, however, cenſure and condemn others; but attend to myſelf and be humble. Adieu.</p>

               <p>But you have often encouraged my eccentri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities by your ſmile, and muſt therefore ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge them.</p>
               <p>Nature has furniſhed me with a gay diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and happy is it for me, that a lax educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has not ſtrengthened the folly too commonly ariſing from it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Williams's inſtructions were very ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably interpoſed to impreſs my mind with a ſenſe of virtue and propriety. I truſt they have had the deſired effect; and that they will prove the guardian of my youth, and the directory of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer age. How often has the dear, good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man taken me into her chamber, and reminded me of indecorums of which I was unconſcious at the time; but thankful afterwards that they had not eſcaped her judicious eye; as her obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations tended to rectify my errors, and render
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:033748_0122_0FF92BFB72D75D98"/>
me more cautious and circumſpect in future. How ſalutary is advice like her's; conveyed, not with the dogmatic air of ſupercilious wiſdom; but with the condeſcending eaſe and ſoothing kindneſs of an affectionate parent, anxiouſly concerned for the beſt good of thoſe under her care!</p>
               <p>I was very happy at Harmony-Grove; and the reſult of that happineſs, I hope, will accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany me through life.</p>
               <p>Yet I find the gaiety of the town adapted to my taſte; nor does even Mrs. Williams condemn the enjoyment of its pleaſures.</p>
               <p>I was, laſt evening, at a ball; and I aſſure you, the attention I gained, and the gallantry diſplayed to attract my notice and approbation, were very flattering to my vanity; though I could not forbear inwardly ſmiling at the futile arts of the pretty fellows who exhibited them.</p>
               <p>Their ſpeeches appeared to have been ſo long practiſed, that I was on the point of adviſing them to exerciſe their genius, if they had any, in the invention of ſomething new. But a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite conformity to the <hi>ton</hi> reſtrained my ſatire. Adieu.</p>

               <p>I AM diſappointed and diſpleaſed, Cleora! I have long been anxious to procure the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs de Sevignè's letters, having often heard them mentioned as ſtandards of taſte and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance in the epiſtolary way. This excited my curioſity, and raiſed my hopes of finding a rich entertainment of wit and ſentiment. I have peruſed, and peruſed in vain; for they anſwer not my ideas of either. They are replete with local circumſtances, which, to indifferent read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, are neither amuſing nor intereſting. True, the ſtyle is eaſy and ſprightly; but they are chiefly compoſed of family matters, ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to her own movements and thoſe of her daughter; many of which are of too trifling a nature to be ranked in the claſs of elegant wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. I own myſelf, however, not a competent judge of their merit as a whole, even in my own eſtimation; for I have read the two firſt vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umes only.</p>
               <p>That letters ought to be written with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity of perſonal converſation, I allow; yet many ſuch converſations, even between perſons of taſte and refinement, are unworthy the public attention.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="unknown:033748_0124_0FF92C1A2D141D88"/>Equal was my chagrin, not long ſince, on reading Pope's letters. He, ſaid I to myſelf, who bears the palm from all contemporary po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, and who is ſo conſummate a maſter of this divine art, muſt ſurely furniſh a ſource of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior entertainment, when he deſcends to friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſocial communications.</p>
               <p>Indeed, there are good ſentiments and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious obſervations, interſperſed in his letters; but the greater part of them have little other merit than what ariſes from the ſtyle.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you will charge me with arrogance, for preſuming to criticiſe, much more to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, publications which have ſo long been ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by general approbation. Independent in opinion, I write it without reſerve, and cenſure not any one who thinks differently. Give me your ſentiments with the ſame freedom upon the books which you honor with a peruſal, and you will oblige your affectionate</p>

               <p>I RECEIVED your's with thoſe lively ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of pleaſure which your favours always afford. As I was peruſing it, my papa came into the room. He took it out of my hand, and read it; then returning it with the ſmile of approbation; I think, ſaid he, that your correſpondent has played the critic very well. Has ſhe played it juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Sir? ſaid I. Why, it is a long time, ſaid he, ſince I read the Marchioneſs de Sevigne's letters. I am not, therefore, a judge of their merit. But, with regard to Pope, I blame not the ſex for retaliating upon him; for he always treated them ſatirically. I believe revenge was no part of my friend's plan, ſaid I. She is far ſuperior to ſo malignant a paſſion; though, were ſhe capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſeeking it, it would be in behalf of her ſex.</p>
               <p>Company now coming in, the converſation ſhifted.</p>
               <p>I have often ſmiled at the pitiful wit of thoſe ſatiriſts and eſſayiſts, who laviſh abundant elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence on trifling foibles, the mere whims of a day; and of no conſequence to the body natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, moral, or political. The extenſion of a hoop, the contraction of the waiſt, or the eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the head-dreſs, frequently afford matter
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:033748_0126_0FF92C2A0FAE8AA8"/>
for pages of elaborate diſcuſſion. Theſe reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, too, always aim at the good of our ſex! I think it a great pity they do not lop off ſome of their own exuberant follies; though, perhaps, they wiſh us to exchange labours; and, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn for their benevolent exertions, that we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to expoſe and correct their errors. I have ſometimes thought their ſatire to be tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured with malice; and that the cauſe of their diſaffection may generally be found in perſonal reſentment. Had Pope and his coadjutors been favourites with the ladies, I doubt not but they would have found more excellencies in them than they have ever yet allowed.</p>
               <p>I have lately been reading the generous and polite Fitzoſborne's letters; and I need not tell you how much I was pleaſed and charmed with them.</p>
               <p>The juſtneſs of his ſentiments, and the eaſe and elegance of his diction are at once intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and improving. His letter and ode to his wife on the anniverſary of their marriage, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs any thing of the kind I have ever read. I verily think, that, had I the offer of a heart capable of dictating ſuch manly tenderneſs of expreſſion, and ſuch pathetic energy of generous love, I ſhould be willing to give my hand in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and aſſent to thoſe ſolemn words, "love, honor, and—(I had almoſt ſaid) obey."

               <p>I AGREE with you, that the habits of the weak and vain are too inſignificant to employ the pens of thoſe, whoſe literary talents might produce great and good effects in the political, moral, and religious ſtate of things.

               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the coldneſs of the ſeaſon, every heart ſeems to be enlivened, and every mind exhilarated by the anniverſary of the new year.

                  <salute>DEAR CLEORA,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I HAVE this week engaged in the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the nuptials of my friend, Amanda South. A ſplendid wedding, a gay company, an elegant ſupper, and a magnificent ball, were the ſum of our entertainment.</p>
               <p>I imagine ſuch exhilarating ſcenes deſigned to diſpel the anxiety and thoughtfulneſs, which ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery reflecting perſon muſt feel on this ſolemn occaſion. This untried ſtate preſents to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive mind ſuch a variety of new cares and duties, that cheerfulneſs, feſtivity, and hilarity ſeem neceſſary to baniſh the thought of them, ſo far as to render a delicate and ſenſible female ſufficiently compoſed to conduct with propriety. But I muſt confeſs, that, were I called to the trial, I ſhould chooſe to retire from the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe indifferent and unfeeling ſpectators, to whom the bluſhing modeſty of a bride is often a paſtime.</p>
               <p>Indeed, Cleora, when we look around the world and obſerve the great number of unhappy marriages, which were contracted with the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt proſpects, yet, from ſome unforeſeen cauſe, have involved the parties in wretchedneſs for life, we may well indulge a diffidence of our own
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:033748_0133_0FF92C6DE3033220"/>
abilities to diſcharge the duties of the ſtation, and be ſolicitous that our future companion ſhould in all reſpects be qualified to aſſiſt in bearing the burdens of the conjugal ſtate.</p>
               <p>Experience only can determine how far we are right in the judgment we form of ourſelves, and of the perſon of our choice. So many are the deceptions which love and courtſhip impoſe upon their votaries, that I believe it very difficult for the parties concerned to judge impartially, or to diſcern faults, where they look only for virtues. Hence they are ſo frequently miſled in their opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, and find, too late, the errors into which they have been betrayed.</p>
               <p>When do you come to Boſton, Cleora? I am impatient for your ſociety; becauſe your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is void of flattery, and your ſincerity and cheerfulneſs are always agreeable and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous. Adieu.</p>

               <p>INDEED, Harriot, I open your letters with as much gravity as I would a ſermon; you have ſuch a knack of moralizing upon every event! What mortal elſe would feel ſerious and ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental at a wedding? Poſitively, you ſhall not come to mine. Your preſence, I fear, would put ſuch a reſtraint upon me, as to render me quite fooliſh and awkward in my appearance.</p>
               <p>However, I muſt acknowledge it a weighty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair; and what you ſay has, perhaps, too much truth in it to be jeſted with. I believe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we had better reſolve not to riſk the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of a wrong choice, or imprudent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; but wiſely devote ourſelves to celibacy. I am ſure we ſhould make a couple of very clev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er old maids. If you agree to this propoſition, we will begin in ſeaſon to accuſtom ourſelves to the virtues and habits of a ſingle life. By ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving what is amiſs in the conduct of others in the ſame ſtate, and avoiding their errors, I doubt not but we may bring even the title into repute. In this way we ſhall be uſeful to many of our own ſex, though I am aware it would be a moſt grievous diſpenſation to a couple of the other; but no matter for that.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="unknown:033748_0135_0FF92C820D7DDF68"/>The world needs ſome ſuch examples as we might become; and if we can be inſtrumental of retrieving <hi>old-maidiſm</hi> from the imputation of ill-nature, oddity, and many other mortifying charges, which are now brought againſt it, I believe we ſhall ſave many a good girl from an unequal and unhappy marriage. It might have a ſalutary effect on the other ſex too. Finding the ladies independent in ſentiment, they would be impelled to greater circumſpection of conduct to merit their favour.</p>
               <p>You ſee that my benevolence is extenſive. I wiſh to become a general reformer. What ſay you to my plan, Harriot? If you approve it, diſmiſs your long train of admirers immediately, and act not the part of a coquette, by retaining them out of pride or vanity. We muſt riſe above ſuch narrow views, and let the world know that we act from principle, if we mean to do good by our example. I ſhall continue to receive the addreſſes of this ſame Junius, till I hear that you have acceded to my propoſal; and then, diſplay my fortitude by renouncing a connexion which muſt be doubtful as to the iſſue, and will certainly expoſe me to the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of being looked at, when I am married. Farewell.</p>

               <p>I HAVE juſt returned from a rural excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, where, in the thicket of a grove, I enjoyed all the luxury of ſolitude. The ſun had nearly finiſhed his diurnal courſe, and was leaving our hemiſphere to illuminate the other with his cheering rays.</p>
               <p>The ſprightly ſongſters had retired to their bowers, and were diſtending their little throats with a tribute of inſtinctive gratitude and praiſe.</p>
               <p>The vocal ſtrains re-echoed from tree to tree, and invited me to join the reſponſive notes. My heart expanded with devotion and benevolence. I wiſhed the whole human kind to ſhare the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and the happineſs which I enjoyed; while the inanimate creation around ſeemed to partake of my ſatisfaction! Methought the fields aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed a livelier verdure; and the zephyrs were unuſually officious in wafting the fragrance of aromatic gales. I ſurveyed the ſurrounding ſcenery with rapturous admiration; and my heart glowed with inexpreſſible delight at the lovely appearance of nature, and the diffuſive bounties of its almighty Author!</p>
               <p>Let others, ſaid I, exult in ſtately domes, and the ſuperfluities of pomp; immerſe themſelves
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:033748_0137_0FF92CA1C4C09938"/>
in the ſplendid novelties of faſhion, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous crowd of giddy amuſements! I envy them not.</p>
               <l>Give me a mind to range the ſylvan ſcene,</l>
               <l>And taſte the bleſſings of the vernal day;</l>
               <l>While ſocial joys, and friendly, intervene</l>
               <l>To chaſe the gloomy cares of life away.</l>
               <p>I wiſh not to abandon ſociety, nor to reſign the pleaſures which it affords; but it is a ſelect number of friends, not a promiſcuous crowd, which I prefer.</p>
               <p>When the mind is much engroſſed by diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting pleaſures, it is apt to forget itſelf, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect its own dignity and improvement. It is neceſſary often to retreat from the noiſe and buſtle of the world, and commune with our own hearts. By this mean we ſhall be the better qualified both to diſcharge the duties and participate the enjoyments of life.</p>
               <p>Solitude affords a nearer and more diſtinct view of the works of creation; elevates the mind, and purifies its paſſions and affections.</p>
               <l>O Solitude! in thee the boundleſs mind</l>
               <l>Expands itſelf, and revels unconfin'd;</l>
               <l>From thee, each vain, each grov'lling paſſion flies,</l>

                  <salute>DEAR SISTER,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I AM not ſo far engaged by the new ſcenes of faſhionable gaiety which ſurround me, as to forget you and the other dear friends, whom I left at Harmony-Grove. Yet ſo great is the novelty which I find in this crowded metropolis, that you cannot wonder if my attention is very much engroſſed. Mr. and Mrs. Henly, with their amiable daughters, are extremely polite and attentive to me; and have taken every method to contribute to my amuſement. I went, yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, in their company, to Commencement at Cambridge; and was very much entertained with the exhibition. I pretend not to be a judge of the talents diſplayed by the young gentlemen who took an active part; or of the proficiency they had made in ſcience. I have an opinion of my own, notwithſtanding; and can tell how far my eye and ear were gratified.</p>
               <p>I never knew before that dreſs was a claſſical ſtudy; which I now conclude it muſt be, or it would not have exerciſed the genius of ſome of the principal ſpeakers on this public occaſion!</p>
               <p>The female garb too, ſeemed to claim particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar attention. The <hi>bon ton,</hi> taſte, and faſhions of our ſex, afforded a ſubject of declamation to the
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:033748_0141_0FF92CD7D79D7C88"/>
orator; and of entertainment to the audience, compoſed, in part, of our legiſlators, politicians, and divines! I could not but think that thoſe ſcholars who employ their time in ſtudying, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigating, and criticiſing the ladies' dreſſes, might as well be occupied in the buſineſs of a frizeur or the man-millener; either of which would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford them more frequent opportunities for the diſplay of their abilities, and render their labours more extenſively uſeful to the ſex. Others might then improve the time, which <hi>they</hi> thus frivolouſly engroſſed on this anniverſary, in contributing to the entertainment of the <hi>literati,</hi> who doubtleſs expect to be gratified by the exertions of genius, and an apparent progreſs in thoſe ſtudies, which are deſigned to qualify the riſing youth of Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica for important ſtations both in church and ſtate.</p>
               <p>The aſſembly was extremely brilliant; the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſeemed to vie with each other in magnificent decorations. So much lovelineſs was viſible in their native charms, that, without any hint from the ſpeakers of the day, I ſhould have thought it a pity to add thoſe foreign ornaments, which rather obſcure than aid them.</p>
               <p>I was a little diſpleaſed by the unbecoming levity of ſome of my ſex; and apprehenſive leſt it might induce misjudging and cenſorious people to imagine that they were led thither more by
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:033748_0142_0FF8C787A28785F8"/>
the vanity of attracting notice, than to receive any mental entertainment.</p>
               <p>Without our conſent, we ran a race back to town, which endangered our necks. The avari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious hackman, deſirous of returning for another freight, had no mercy on his paſſengers or horſes. However, we arrived ſafely, though much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued by the pleaſure of the day.</p>
               <p>Pleaſure carried to exceſs degenerates into pain. This I actually experienced; and ſighed for the tranquil enjoyments of Harmony-Grove, to which I propoſe ſoon to return, and convince you how affectionately I am your's.</p>

               <p>YOUR enlivening letter reſtored us, in ſome meaſure, to your ſociety; or at leaſt allevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the pain of your abſence.</p>
               <p>I am glad you attended Commencement. It was a new ſcene, and conſequently extended your ideas. I think you rather ſevere on the claſſical gentlemen. We ſimple country-folks muſt not preſume to arraign <hi>their</hi> taſte, whoſe learning and abilities render them conſpicuous on the literary ſtage. They, doubtleſs, write on ſubjects beſt adapted to their capacities. As for the follies of faſhion, I think the gentlemen are under obligations to the ladies for adopting them; ſince it gives exerciſe to their genius and pens.</p>
               <p>You were tired, you ſay, with pleaſure. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thoſe diſſipating ſcenes, which greatly exhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arate the ſpirits, call for the whole attention, and oblige us to exert every power, are always fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguing.</p>
               <p>Pleaſures of a calmer kind, which are moder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately enjoyed, which enliven rather than exhauſt, and which yield a ſerenity of mind on reflection, are the moſt durable, rational, and ſatisfying. Pleaſure is the moſt alluring object which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the view of the young and inexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced.
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:033748_0144_0FF92CF35C4434C0"/>
Under various forms it courts our atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but, while we are ſtill eager in the purſuit, it eludes our graſp. Its faſcinating charms de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the imagination, and create a bower of bliſs in every diſtant object. But let us be careful not to fix our affections on any thing which bears this name, unleſs it be founded on virtue, and will endure the ſevereſt ſcrutiny of examination.</p>
               <p>Our honored mamma, and all your friends here, are impatient for your return. They uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly long to embrace, and bid you welcome to theſe ſeats of ſimplicity and eaſe: but none more ardently, than your affectionate ſiſter,</p>

                  <salute>DEAR MATILDA,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>ANXIOUS to make the beſt poſſible uſe of the education I have received; and fully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with the idea, that the human mind is capable of continual improvements, it is my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant endeavour to extract honey from every flower which falls in my way, or, to ſpeak with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a figure, to derive advantage from every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident. Purſuant to the advice of our excellent Preceptreſs, I keep this perpetually in view; and am therefore diſappointed when defeated in the attempt.</p>
               <p>This afternoon I have been in company with three ladies, celebrated for their beauty and wit. One of them, I think, may juſtly claim the rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utation of beauty. To a finiſhed form, a fair complexion, and an engaging, animating coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance are added. Yet a conſciouſneſs of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior charms was apparent in her deportment; and a ſupercilious air counteracted the effects of her perſonal accompliſhments. The two others were evidently more indebted to art than to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for their appearance. It might eaſily be diſcovered that paint conſtituted all the delicacy of their complexion!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="unknown:033748_0146_0FF92D0192DB4928"/>What a pity, that ſo many are deceived in their ideas of beauty! Certain it is, that artificial ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions ſerve rather to impair than increaſe its power. "Who can paint like nature?" What hand is ſkilful enough to ſupply her defects? Do not thoſe who attempt it always fail, and render themſelves diſguſting? Do they not really injure what they ſtrive to mend; and make it more indifferent than uſual, when diveſted of its temporary embelliſhments? Beauty cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly maintain its ſway over its moſt obſequious votaries, unleſs the manners and the mind uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly contribute to ſecure it. How vain then is this ſubterfuge! It may deceive the eye, and gain the flattery of the prattling coxcomb; but accumulated neglect and mortification inevitably await thoſe who truſt in the wretched alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native.</p>
               <p>From their good ſenſe, I had been led to expect the greateſt entertainment. I therefore waited impatiently till the firſt compliments were over, and converſation commenced.</p>
               <p>But, to my extreme regret, I found it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of ludicrous inſinuations, hackneyed jeſts, and ſatirical remarks upon others of their acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance who were abſent. The pretty fellows of the town were criticiſed; and their own adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in ſhopping were related with ſo much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuteneſs, hilarity, and glee, that I bluſhed for the frivolous levity of thoſe of my ſex, who could
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:033748_0147_0FF92D09F42190D8"/>
ſubſtitute buffoonery for wit, and the effuſions of a perverted imagination for that refined and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving converſation, which a well cultivated mind and a correct taſte are calculated to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford!</p>
               <p>If, ſaid I to myſelf, this be the beauty and the wit of poliſhed ſociety, reſtore me again to the native ſimplicity and ſincerity of Harmony-Grove!</p>
               <p>I took my leave as ſoon as politeneſs would allow; and left them to animadvert upon me. Independent for happineſs on the praiſe or cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſuperficial minds, let me ever be conſcious of meriting approbation, and I ſhall reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented in the certain proſpect of receiving it. Adieu.</p>

               <p>I SYMPATHIZE with you, my dear Sophia, in the diſappointment you received in your expectations from beauty and wit.</p>
               <p>You may nevertheleſs derive advantage from it. Your refined and delicate ideas raiſe you too far above the ſcenes of common life. They paint the defects of your inferiors in ſuch lively colours, that the greater part of the community muſt be diſpleaſing to you. Few, you ſhould remember, have had the advantages which you have enjoyed; and ſtill fewer have your penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting eye, correct taſte, and quick ſenſibility. Let charity then draw a veil over the foibles of oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and candour induce you to look on the beſt and brighteſt ſide.</p>
               <p>It is both our duty and intereſt to enjoy life, as far as integrity and innocence allow; and, in order to this, we muſt not ſoar above, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate ourſelves <hi>to</hi> its ordinary ſtate. We cannot ſtem the torrent of folly and vanity; but we can ſtep aſide and ſee it roll on, without ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering ourſelves to be borne down by the ſtream.</p>
               <p>Empty converſation muſt be diſguſting to ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery rational and thinking mind; yet, when it partakes not of malignity, it is harmleſs in its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, as the vapour which floats over the mead in
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:033748_0149_0FF92D2F9F5C1F38"/>
a ſummer's <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But, when malice and envy join to give ſcope to detraction, we ought to avoid their contagion, and decidedly condemn the effuſions of the ill-natured merriment which they inſpire.</p>
               <p>Our ſex have been taxed as defamers. I am convinced, however, that they are not excluſively guilty; yet, for want of more ſubſtantial matter of converſation, I fear they too often give occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the accuſation! A mind properly culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, and ſtored with uſeful knowledge, will deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe a paſtime which muſt be ſupported at the expenſe of others. Hence only the ſuperficial and the giddy are reduced to the neceſſity of filling the time in which they aſſociate together, with the degrading and injurious ſubjects of ſlander. But I truſt that our improved country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women are riſing far ſuperior to this neceſſity, and are able to convince the world, that the American fair are enlightened, generous, and liberal. The falſe notions of ſexual diſparity, in point of underſtanding and capacity, are juſtly exploded; and each branch of ſociety is uniting to raiſe the virtues and poliſh the manners of the whole.</p>

               <p>FROM your recommendation of Mrs. Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone's letters; and, what is ſtill more, from the character given them by Mrs. Williams, I was anxious to poſſeſs the book; but, not being able to procure it here, my clerical brother, who was fortunately going to Boſton, bought and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to me.</p>
               <p>I am much gratified by the peruſal, and flatter myſelf that I ſhall derive laſting benefit from it.</p>
               <p>So intricate is the path of youth, and ſo many temptations lurk around to beguile our feet aſtray, that we really need ſome ſkilful pilot to guide us through the deluſive maze. To an attentive and docile mind, publications of this ſort may afford much inſtruction and aid. They ought, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to be carefully collected, and diligently pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſed.</p>
               <p>Anxious to make my brother ſome acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edgment for his preſent, I wrought and ſent him a purſe, accompanied with a dedication which I thought might amuſe ſome of his ſolitary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and which, for that purpoſe, I here tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe and convey to you.</p>

Many, however, think life inſupportable, except in the buſtle and diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of a city. Of this number is the volatile Amelia Parr, whom you know as well as I. So extreme is her gaiety, that the good qualities of her mind are ſuffered to lie dormant; while the moſt reſtleſs paſſions are indulged without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint. I have juſt received a letter from her, which you will ſee to be characteriſtic of her diſpoſition. I encloſe that, and my anſwer to it for your peruſal.

               <p>But this boarding ſchool; this Harmony-Grove, where you formerly reſided, has given you ſtrange ideas of the world.

               <p>YOUR letter—your rattle, rather, came to hand yeſterday. I could not avoid ſmiling at your erroneous opinions; and, in my turn, beg leave to expreſs my wonder at your entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in town. True, we have no plays. We are not obliged by faſhion to ſit, half ſuffocated in a crowd, for the greater part of the night, to hear the rantings, and ſee the extravagant actions of the buſkin heroes, (and thoſe not always
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:033748_0156_0FF92D8883D527C8"/>
conſiſtent with female modeſty to witneſs!) We have no card-parties, avowedly formed for the purpoſe of <hi>killing time!</hi> But we have an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able neighbourhood; among which we can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily collect a ſocial circle; and perſons of taſte, politeneſs and information compoſe it. Here we enjoy a rational and enlivening converſation, which is at once refined and improving. We have no aſſemblies, compoſed of a promiſcuous crowd of gaudy belles and beaux; many of whom we ſhould deſpiſe in a private company, and deem unworthy our notice. But we have genteel balls, the company of which is ſelect, none being admitted but ſuch as do honor to themſelves and each other. The amuſement is not protracted till the yawning liſtleſſneſs of the company proclaims their incapacity for enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but we retire at a ſeaſonable hour, and add to the pleaſure of the evening that of undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed reſt through the night. Of courſe, we can riſe with the fun, and ſip the nectarious dews, waſted in the aromatic gale. We break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt before the heat of the day has brought on a languor, and deprived us of appetite; after which, we amuſe ourſelves with our needles, books, or muſic; recline on the ſofa, or ramble in the grove, as fancy or convenience directs. In the ſhady bower we enjoy either the luxury of ſolitude, or the pleaſures of ſociety; while you are, the whole time, in the midſt of hurry
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:033748_0157_0FF8C7AEE5645F58"/>
and buſtle. Eager in the chaſe, <hi>you</hi> fly from one ſcene of diſſipation to another; but the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue of this ceaſeleſs round, and the exertion of ſpirits neceſſary to ſupport it, render the objects of purſuit taſteleſs and inſipid.</p>
               <p>Which mode of life, yours or mine, do you now think the moſt rational, and productive of the greateſt happineſs? The boarding ſchool, which you affect to deſpiſe, has, it is true, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my taſte; and I flatter myſelf that I ſhall never wiſh it altered.</p>
               <p>I ſhall ſoon return to town; but not for pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure. It is not in crowds that I ſeek it. Adieu.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>HAVING been with my aunt Burchel for a fortnight paſt, I have indulged myſelf in reading novels; with which her library is well ſupplied.</p>
               <p>Richardſon's works have occupied a large por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the time. What a ſurpriſing command has this great maſter of the paſſions over our feelings! It is happy for his own and ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ages, that he embarked in the cauſe of virtue. For his influence on the affections of his readers is ſo great, that it muſt have proved very perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, had he enliſted on the ſide of vice. Though am not much of a novel reader, yet his pen has operated like magic on my fancy; and ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely was I intereſted, that I could have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with ſleep or food for the pleaſure I found in reading him.</p>
               <p>By this circumſtance I am more than ever convinced of the great caution which ought to be uſed in peruſing writings of the kind. How ſecretly, and how inſidiouſly may they undermine the fabric of virtue, by painting vice and folly in the alluring colours, and with the lively ſtyle of
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:033748_0159_0FF92D9A31AA7A40"/>
this ingenious author. The mind ſhould be well informed, and the judgment properly matured, before young people indulge themſelves in the unreſtrained peruſal of them.</p>
               <p>The examples of virtue and noble qualities, exhibited by the author I have mentioned, are truly uſeful; but every writer of novels is not a Richardſon: and what dreadful effects might the ſpecious manners of a Lovelace have on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced mind, were they not detected by a juſt exhibition of his vices!</p>
               <p>The noble conduct of Clementina and Miſs Byron are worthy of imitation; while the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of Clariſſa, in putting herſelf under the protection of a libertine, is a warning to every fair. But both examples are often overlooked. While the ear is charmed with the ſtyle, and the fancy riots on the luxuriance of deſcription, which ſo intimately blend the charms of virtue and the faſcinations of vice; they are not read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily diſtinguiſhed by all.</p>
               <p>I am not equally pleaſed with all Richardſon's writings; yet ſo multifarious are his excellencies, that his faults appear but ſpecks, which ſerve as foils to diſplay his beauties to better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
               <p>Before I went from home I was engaged in reading a courſe of hiſtory; but I fear I ſhall
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:033748_0160_0FF92D9F1CF64A98"/>
not return from this flowery field to the dry and leſs pleaſing path of more laborious ſtudies. This is one diſadvantage of novel reading. It diſſipates the ideas, relaxes the mind, and renders it inattentive to the more ſolid and uſeful branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of literature. Adieu.</p>

               <p>INDEED, my dear Harriot, you are making an important change of ſituation; a change in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting to you and your friends; a change which involves, not only your own happineſs, but the happineſs of the worthy man whom you have choſen, of the family, over which you are to preſide, and perhaps, too, of that with which you are to be connected.</p>
               <p>I rejoice to hear that this connexion, on which ſo much depends, is not haſtily formed; but that it is the reſult of long acquaintance, is founded on merit, and conſolidated by eſteem. From characters like yours, mutually deſerving and excellent, brilliant examples of conjugal vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and felicity may be expected. Yet as hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature is imperfect, liable to errors, and apt to deviate from the line of rectitude and propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, a monitorial guide may be expedient and uſeful. Your partiality has led you to requeſt this <hi>boon</hi> of me; but diffidence of my own abil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities compels me to decline the arduous taſk. Nevertheleſs, I have it happily in my power to recommend an abler inſtructor, who has written profeſſedly upon the ſubject. The AMERICAN SPECTATOR, or MATRIMONIAL PRECEPTOR, late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly publiſhed by Mr. David Weſt, of Boſton,
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:033748_0164_0FF8C7C50B70C988"/>
contains all you can wiſh. The judicious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piler has collected and arranged his materials with admirable ſkill and addreſs. Peruſe this book, and you will be at no loſs for counſels to direct, and cautions to guard you through the intricate cares and duties of the connubial life. The eſſays are, chiefly, extracted from the moſt approved Engliſh writers. The productions of ſo many able pens, properly diſpoſed, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in a new and agreeable light, muſt not only be entertaining, but uſeful to every reader of taſte and judgment. I wiſh this publication to be conſidered as a neceſſary piece of furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by every houſekeeper. The editor has cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly deſerved well of his country; and Hymen ſhould crown him with unfading garlands.</p>
               <p>I ſhall viſit you, my dear Harriot, after the happy knot (for ſuch I flatter myſelf it will prove) is tied. In the mean time, I ſubſcribe myſelf, with the moſt ardent wiſhes for your proſperity and happineſs, your ſincere friend,</p>

               <p>WHAT think you of wit, Cleora? If you eſtimate it by the worth of your own, you think it an invaluable jewel. But this jewel is vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſet. Yours is in the pure ſterling gold of good ſenſe: yet, as diſplayed by ſome, it gliſtens on the mere tinſel of gaiety, which will not bear the ſcrutinizing eye of judgment.</p>
               <p>Yeſterday I received a viſit from a young lady, lately moved into this neighbourhood, who is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted a wit. Her converſation reminded me of Pope's ſatirical remark:</p>
               <l>"There are, whom Heaven has bleſs'd with ſtore of wit;</l>
               <l>But want as much again to manage it."</l>
               <p>I found her's to conſiſt in ſmart ſayings, lively repartees, and ludicrous alluſions.</p>
               <p>So ſtrong was her propenſity to diſplay this talent, that ſhe could not reſiſt any temptation which offered, though it led her to offend againſt the rules of politeneſs and generoſity. As ſome perſons of real genius were preſent, topics of literature and morality were diſcuſſed. Upon theſe ſhe was mute as a ſtatue; but whenever the playfulneſs of her fancy could find a ſubject, ſhe was extremely loquacious. This induced me to ſuſpect that the brilliance of her imagination
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:033748_0166_0FF92E214BFD0010"/>
had dazzled her underſtanding, and rendered her negligent of the more ſolid and uſeful acquiſitions of the mind.</p>
               <p>Is it not often the caſe, that thoſe who are diſtinguiſhed by any ſuperior endowment, wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er perſonal or mental, are too much elated by the conſciouſneſs of their pre-eminence, and think it ſufficient to counterbalance every deficiency?</p>
               <p>This, Mrs. Williams uſed to ſay, is owing to the want of ſelf-knowledge; which, if once poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, will enable us properly to eſtimate our own characters, and to aſcertain with preciſion wherein we are defective, as well as wherein we excel. But it is the misfortune of <hi>us,</hi> young people, that we ſeldom attain this valuable ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, till we have experienced many of the ills which reſult from the want of it. Ambition, vanity, flattery, or ſome ſuch dazzling meteor, engroſſes our attention, and renders us blind to more important qualifications.</p>
               <p>But to return to this ſame wit, of which I was ſpeaking. It is certainly a very dangerous talent, when imprudently managed. None that we can poſſeſs tends ſo directly to excite enmity, or deſtroy friendſhip.</p>
               <p>An ill-natured wit is of all characters the moſt univerſally dreaded. People of this deſcription are always feared, but rarely loved. Humanity and benevolence are eſſentially neceſſary to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:033748_0167_0FF92E3F74F432B8"/>
wit agreeable. Accompanied by theſe, it cannot fail to pleaſe and entertain.</p>
               <l>"Wit, how delicious to man's dainty taſte!</l>
               <l>'Tis precious as the vehicle of ſenſe;</l>
               <l>But as its ſubſtitute, a dire diſeaſe!</l>
               <l>Pernicious talent! flatter'd by mankind,</l>
               <l>Yet hated too.—</l>
               <l>Senſe is the diamond, weighty, ſolid, ſound:</l>
               <l>When cut by wit, it caſts a brighter beam;</l>
               <l>Yet, wit apart, it is a diamond ſtill.</l>
               <l>Wit, widow'd of good ſenſe, is worſe than nought;</l>
               <l>It hoiſts more ſail to run againſt a rock."</l>
               <p>But I believe I cannot give a better proof of my own wit, than to conclude this ſcribble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your patience is quite exhauſted by the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſal. Adieu.</p>

and ſituation contribute to the happineſs of life?

I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that no pleaſures make ſo deep an impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on the memory, as thoſe of the firſt and moſt innocent period of our lives. With what apparent delight do perſons; advanced in years, re-trace their puerile feats and diverſions!

               </p>
               <p>The pleaſures of childhood and youth, when regulated by parental wiſdom, and ſweetened by filial affection and obedience, muſt be grateful to the recollection at any age: and for this plain reaſon, becauſe innocence and ſimplicity are their leading traits. How ſoothing, how animating, then, muſt be reflection, at the evening of a life, wholly ſpent in virtue and rectitude!</p>
               <p>Pope obſerves that "Every year is a critique on the laſt. The man deſpiſes the boy, the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher the man, and the Chriſtian all."

For this purpoſe, I muſt inſiſt on the performance of your promiſe to ſpend the winter in town. It is true that I cannot contribute to your amuſement in kind. Yet, according to the generally received opinion, that variety is neceſſary to the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life, we may find <hi>our's</hi> mutually height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by the exchange. Delightful rambles, and hours of contemplative ſolitude, free from the interruptions of formality and faſhion, I cannot inſure; but you may depend on all that friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and aſſiduity can ſubſtitute; and while the bleak winds are howling abroad, a cheerful fire-ſide, and a ſocial circle, may diſpel the gloom of the ſeaſon. The pleaſures of our family are very local. Few are ſought, in which the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and affections can have no ſhare. For this reaſon, a ſelect, not a promiſcuous acquaintance is cultivated. And however unfaſhionable our practice may be deemed, we can find entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, even in the dull hours of winter, without recourſe to cards. Almoſt every other recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:033748_0171_0FF92E6A893B72F8"/>
affords ſome exerciſe and improvement to the body or mind, or both; but from this nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can reſult. The whole attention is abſorbed by the game. Reaſon lies dormant, and the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions only are awake. However little is depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the parties are frequently as much agitated by hope and fear, as if their all were at ſtake. It is difficult for the vanquiſhed not to feel cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grin; while the victors are gratified at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe of their friends. But the principal objection with me, is the utter excluſion of converſation; a ſource of pleaſure, and of profit too, for which I can admit nothing as an equivalent. Winter evenings are peculiarly adapted to this rational and refined entertainment. Deprived of that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of ſcenery, and thoſe beauties of nature, which the vernal and autumnal ſeaſons exhibit, we are obliged to have recourſe to the fire-ſide for comfort. Here we have leiſure to collect our ſcattered ideas, and to improve, by ſocial intercourſe, and the exertion of our mental powers.</p>
               <p>Our ſex are often rallied on their volubility: and, for myſelf, I frankly confeſs, that I am ſo averſe to taciturnity, and ſo highly prize the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of ſociety and friendſhip, that I had rather plead guilty to the charge than relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh them.</p>

               <p>YOUR's of the 9th ult. has juſt come to hand. It gave me renewed experience of the truth of the obſervation, that next to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal preſence and converſation, is the epiſtolary correſpondence of a friend. I am preparing, with the moſt lively ſenſations of pleaſure, to gratify my own wiſhes, and comply with your polite invitation. The romantic beauty of the rural ſcenes has forſaken me; and what can ſo amply compenſate for their abſence, as the charms you offer?</p>
               <p>I envy you nothing which the town affords, but the advantages you derive from the choice of ſociety adapted to your own taſte. Your ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the faſhionable diverſion of card-play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are, in my view, perfectly juſt. I believe that many people join in it, becauſe it is the <hi>ton,</hi> rather than from any other motive. And as ſuch perſons generally pay the greateſt deference to Lord Cheſterfield's opinions and maxims, I have often wondered how they happened to overlook, or diſregard his animadverſions upon this ſubject; and have felt a ſtrong inclination to tell them, that this <hi>all-accompliſhed</hi> maſter of politeneſs, and oracle of pleaſure, expreſsly ſay,
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:033748_0174_0FF92EA92DBDAFB0"/>
"All amuſements, where neither the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding nor the ſenſes can have the leaſt ſhare, I look upon as frivolous, and the reſources of little minds, who either do not think, or do not love to think."</p>
               <p>We had a pretty party here, laſt evening; and a party it literally was; for it conſiſted entirely of ladies. This ſingular circumſtance was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked by one of the company, who, at leaſt, pretended to think it agreeable, becauſe, ſaid ſhe, we can now ſpeak without reſtraint, or the fear of criticiſm. I confeſs that I was not prude enough to acquieſce in her opinion.</p>
               <p>Ladies of delicacy and refinement will not countenance or ſupport a converſation, which gentlemen of ſenſe and ſentiment can diſapprove. As each were formed for ſocial beings, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the other for ſocial happineſs, I imagine that ſociety receives its greateſt charm from a mutual interchange of ſentiment and knowledge.</p>
               <p>"Both ſexes are reciprocal inſtruments of each other's improvement. The rough ſpirit of the one is tempered by the gentleneſs of the other, which has likewiſe its obligations to that ſpirit. Men's ſentiments contract a milder turn in the company of women, who, on the other hand, find their volatility abated in that of the men. Their different qualities, intermingling, form a happy ſymphony. From their intimate conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, their real advantages muſt be common and

inſeparable; and as for thoſe ridiculous wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings about ſuperiority, they may be reckoned inſults to nature, and betray a want of a due ſenſe of its wiſe and gracious diſpenſations."<note n="*" place="bottom">The Ladies' Friend.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Many ladies affect to think it inconſiſtent with female reſerve, to acknowledge themſelves pleaſed with the company of the other ſex; but while ſuch are the objects and advantages of a mixed ſociety, I bluſh not to own myſelf deſirous of its cultivation. Adieu.</p>

                  <salute>DEAR CAROLINE,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I TAKE the liberty to ſend you Bennet's Letters. When my mamma put them into my hand, Sophia, ſaid ſhe, I recommend this book to your attentive peruſal. It highly deſerves it, and will richly reward your labour. You have, indeed, completed your ſchool education; but you have much yet to learn. Improvements in knowledge are neceſſarily progreſſive. The human mind is naturally active and eager in purſuit of information; which we have various and continual means of accumulating: but never will <hi>you</hi> have a more favourable opportunity for the cultivation of your mind, than you now enjoy. You are now free from thoſe domeſtic cares and avocations, which may hereafter fall to your lot, and occupy moſt of your time. Speculation muſt then give place to practice. Be aſſiduous, therefore, to increaſe the fund, that it may yield you a competent intereſt, and afford you a conſtant reſource of ſupport and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>With theſe words ſhe withdrew, while I was ſtill liſtening to the ſweet accents of maternal tenderneſs and diſcretion, which vibrated on my ear, even after her departure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="unknown:033748_0177_0FF92EE9D0706B78"/>I find it worthy the recommendation of ſo good a judge. As a moral writer, the precepts and obſervations of its author are excellent; as a religious one, his piety is exemplary, and his inſtructions improving. His ſelection of books, which he deems moſt proper for our ſex, though too numerous, perhaps, may, notwithſtanding, aſſiſt and direct the young, in their courſe of reading.</p>
               <p>Who would not imitate his Louiſa? In her he has forcibly diſplayed the beauties of an amiable diſpoſition, and the advantages which even <hi>that</hi> may derive from a virtuous and religious education.</p>
               <p>Theſe letters are not ſcholaſtic and elaborate diſſertations; they are addreſſed to the heart; they are the native language of affection: and they can hardly fail to inſtil the love of virtue into every mind ſuſceptible of its charms.</p>
               <p>If you have not read them, I will venture to predict that they will afford you entertainment, as well as inſtruction; and if you <hi>have,</hi> they will bear a ſecond peruſal. Indeed, every valuable book ſhould be re-peruſed. On a firſt reading, our curioſity to know ſomething of all it contains, hurries us forward with a rapidity which out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrips both the memory and judgment.</p>
               <p>When this predominant paſſion is gratified, an attentive review will commonly furniſh many
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:033748_0178_0FF92F12536E2EA0"/>
uſeful and important leſſons, which had nearly or quite eſcaped our notice before.</p>
               <p>This, by ſome, is deemed too laborious a taſk. They prefer company and converſation to read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any kind; and allege, in defence of their opinion, that a knowledge of the world, and of human nature, together with that eaſe and grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of manners, which are of the utmoſt conſequence to all who would make a reſpectable figure in life, are much better obtained in this way, than by the cold and unimpaſſioned peruſal of books.</p>
               <p>But is not every acquiſition of this ſort merely ſuperficial? Need we not a guide, ſuperior to our own judgment and experience, to point out the line of duty and propriety, in the various conditions and relations of our exiſtence?</p>
               <p>Our acquaintance with living characters and manners can afford us but a very limited view of mankind, in the different periods and ſtages of ſociety. The inquiſitive mind labours to extend its knowledge to the moſt diſtant climes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote antiquity; and craves other materials for the exerciſe of its reflecting powers, than can be derived from occaſional and deſultory converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now, by what means can this laudable curioſity be ſo effectually ſatisfied, as by the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſal of judicious and well choſen books? Not that I would depreciate the value of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany (for I eſteem it highly;) but add its many
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:033748_0179_0FF92F3C56685400"/>
advantages to thoſe which reading affords. This combination muſt have a happy tendency to give us poſſeſſion, both of the virtues and graces; and to render our attainments at once ſolid and ornamental.</p>
               <p>What think you, Caroline? Do you agree with me in opinion? Let me hear from you by the firſt opportunity; and believe me your's moſt ſincerely.</p>

               <p>I THANK you, my dear friend, for the book you were ſo obliging as to ſend me; and for the letter which accompanied it. The book I had read; but, as you juſtly obſerve, I muſt be a gainer by a ſecond peruſal.</p>
               <p>Upon the ſubject of reading, I perfectly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with you in ſentiment. It is an amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of which I was always enthuſiaſtically fond. Mrs. Williams regulated my taſte; and, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting and maturing my judgment, taught me to make it a ſource of refined and ſubſtantial pleaſure. I do not wiſh to purſue ſtudy as a profeſſion, nor to become a learned lady; but I would pay ſo much attention to it, as to taſte the delights of literature, and be qualified to bear a part in rational and improving converſation. Indeed, I would treaſure up ſuch a fund of uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful knowledge, as may properly direct my courſe through life, and prove an antidote againſt the vexations and diſappointments of the world. I think, Sophia, that our ſex ſtand in ſpecial need of ſuch a reſource to beguile the ſolitary hours which a domeſtic ſtation commonly impoſes. Is it not for want of this that ſome females furniſh a pretext for the accuſation (which is illiberally brought againſt all) of having recourſe to ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:033748_0181_0FF92FAA50034DE0"/>

               <p>I received a letter, yeſterday, from our lively and lovely friend, Anna Williams. How delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully blended in this charming girl, are vivacity and ſentiment, eaſe and propriety. Adieu.</p>

               <p>SO often, my dear Maria, has the pen of the divine, the moraliſt, and the noveliſt been employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the ſubject of female frailty and ſeduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and ſo pathetically has each deſcribed the folly and miſery of the fatal deluſion which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves many in diſgrace, that I am aſtoniſhed when I ſee thoſe, who have the beſt means of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, heedleſsly ſacrificing their reputation, peace and happineſs, to the ſpecious arts of the libertine! In this caſe, it is common for our ſex to rail againſt the other, and endeavour to excite the pity of the world by painting the advantage which has been taken of their credulity and weakneſs. But are we not ſufficiently appriſed of the enemies we have to encounter? And have we not adequate motives to circumſpection and firmneſs?</p>
               <p>I am generally an advocate for my own ſex; but when they ſuffer themſelves to fall a prey to ſeducers, their puſillanimity admits no excuſe. I am bold to affirm that every woman, by behaving with propriety on all occaſions, may not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt temptation, but repel the firſt attempts upon her honor and virtue.</p>
               <p>That levity of deportment, which invites and encourages deſigners, ought ſtudiouſly to be
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:033748_0183_0FF93002010546B8"/>
avoided. Flattery and vanity are two of the moſt dangerous foes to the ſex. A fondneſs for admiration inſenſibly throws them off their guard, and leads them to liſten and give credit to the profeſſions of thoſe who lie in wait to deceive.</p>
               <p>The following remarks, though ſevere, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, can hardly be deemed inconſiſtent with the character which their author aſſumes.<note n="*" place="bottom">The Ladies' Friend.</note> "Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men would do well to forbear their declamations againſt the falſity and wickedneſs of men; the fault is theirs, to fall into ſuch coarſe-ſpun ſnares as are laid for them.</p>
               <p>"That ſervile obſequiouſneſs which women ſhould immediately look upon as the mark of fraud, and which ſhould make them apprehend a ſurpriſe, is the very thing which allures them, and renders them ſoon the victims of perjury and inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; the juſt puniſhment of a diſpoſition which fixes their inclinations on ſuperficial qualities. It is this diſpoſition which draws after them a crowd of empty ſops, who, if they have any meaning at all, it is only to deceive. Something pleaſing in a man's perſon, a giddy air, a perpetual levity, ſupply the place of valuable endowments."</p>
               <p>A recent, and ſingular adventure has rendered obſervations of this ſort peculiarly ſtriking to my mind; which may account for the ſubject and the length of this letter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="unknown:033748_0184_0FF9302E0104D570"/>I will give you a detail of it, though I muſt conceal the real names of the parties concerned.</p>
               <p>Yeſterday, the weather being very fine, and the ſleighing excellent, ſeveral of our family, with two or three friends, were induced to make an excurſion a few miles into the country. We ſtopped at a houſe which had formerly been a tavern, and in which we had often been well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained on ſimilar occaſions. As we were in haſte to receive the benefit of a good fire, we did not notice the removal of the ſign, nor advert to the poſſibility of its being converted to a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate manſion. Being very cold, I ſtepped firſt out of the ſleigh, and ran haſtily in; leaving the gentlemen to exerciſe their gallantry with the other ladies. The room I entered had no fire. I therefore opened the door which led to the next apartment, when I beheld the beautiful and admired Clarinda ſitting in an eaſy chair, pale and wan, with an infant in her arms! I ſtood mute and motionleſs, till the woman of the houſe appeared to conduct me to another room. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and ſhame were viſibly depicted in Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda's countenance; and, unable to meet my eye, ſhe threw her handkerchief over her face, and fell back in her chair.</p>
               <p>I followed the good woman, and, apologizing for my intruſion, told her the cauſe. She rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ollected my having been there before, and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily excuſed my freedom.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="unknown:033748_0185_0FF930586801B6E8"/>By this time the reſt of the company, who had been ſhown into a decent parlour, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring for me; and I could ſcarcely find oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to requeſt my conductreſs to aſk Clarinda's forgiveneſs in my name, and to aſſure her of my ſilence, before I had joined them. I aſſumed an appearance of cheerfulneſs very foreign to the feelings of my heart, and related my miſtake without any mention of the melancholy diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery I had made. We prevailed on the woman to accommodate us with tea and coffee, as we wiſhed to ride no further. While preparations were making, ſhe came in to lay the table, and as ſhe withdrew gave me a token to follow her; when ſhe informed me that Clarinda had been extremely overcome by my detecting her ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but being ſomewhat recovered, deſired a private interview. I accordingly repaired to her apartment, where I found her bathed in tears. Pity operated in my breaſt, and with an air of tenderneſs I offered her my hand; but ſhe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held her's, exclaiming in broken accents, O no! I am polluted—I have forfeited your friendſhip —I am unworthy even of your compaſſion!</p>
               <p>I begged her to be calm, and promiſed her that ſhe ſhould ſuffer no inconvenience from my knowledge of her condition.</p>
               <p>She thanked me for my aſſurances, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined that, ſince ſhe knew the candour and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eroſity of my diſpoſition, ſhe would entruſt me
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:033748_0186_0FF9305F19AEBCD0"/>
with every circumſtance relative to her ſhameful fall; when, after a conſiderable pauſe, ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded nearly in the following words.</p>
               <p>"Though our acquaintance has been for ſome time ſuſpended, and though we have lived in different parts of the town, yet common fame has doubtleſs informed you that I was addreſſed by the gay, and to me, too charming Florimel! To the moſt captivating form, he ſuperadded the winning graces of politeneſs, and all thoſe inſinuating arts which imperceptibly engage the female heart.</p>
               <p>"His flattering attentions, and apparent ardour of affection were to my inexperienced and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible mind proofs of his ſincerity; and the effuſions of the moſt lively paſſion were returned with unſuſpecting confidence.</p>
               <p>"My father, ſtrict in his principles, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for my real welfare, diſapproved his ſuit; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leging that although Florimel was calculated to pleaſe in the gayer moments of life, he was nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertheleſs deſtitute of thoſe ſentiments of religion and virtue, which are eſſentially requiſite to du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable felicity. But I could not be perſuaded that he lacked any perfection which maturer years would not give him; and therefore finding my attachment unconquerable, my father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctantly acquieſced in the propoſed connexion. My ill-judged partiality for this ungenerous man abſorbed every other paſſion and purſuit; while
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:033748_0187_0FF93068D5B163F8"/>
he took advantage of my yielding fondneſs, and aſſumed liberties which I knew to be inconſiſtent with delicacy, but had not reſolution to repel. One encroachment ſuccceded another, and every conceſſion was claimed and granted as a proof of love, till at length he became abſolute maſter of my will and my perſon! Shame and remorſe ſoon rouſed me to a ſenſe of my guilt, and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded an immediate performance of his prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſe of marriage. This, under one pretext or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, he conſtantly evaded. His viſits daily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came leſs frequent, and his attentions leſs aſſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous; while the moſt poignant anguiſh of mind deprived me of every comfort. I found myſelf reduced to the humiliating alternative of entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſeducer to ſcreen me from infamy by the name of wife, though he ſhould never conſider or treat me as ſuch. To this he inſultingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that my ſituation muſt neceſſarily detect our illicit commerce; and his pride could never brook the reputation of having a wife whoſe chaſtity had been ſacrificed. As ſoon as rage and reſentment, which at firſt took from me the power of utterance, would permit, Wretch! ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed I, is it not to you the ſacrifice has been made? Who but you has triumphed over my virtue, and ſubjected me to the diſgrace and wretchedneſs I now ſuffer? Was it not in token of my regard for you that I yielded to your ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations? And is this the requital I am to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive?
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:033748_0188_0FF9309279D51D60"/>
Baſe, ungrateful man! I deſpiſe your meanneſs! I deteſt the ungenerous diſpoſition you betray, and henceforth reject all intercourſe and ſociety with you! I will throw myſelf on the mercy of my injured parents, and renounce you forever.</p>
               <p>"Seeing me almoſt frantic, he endeavoured to ſoothe and appeaſe me. He apologized for the harſhneſs of his language, and even made profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of unabated affection; but gave as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for deferring the conjugal union, at preſent, that commercial affairs obliged him to ſail im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately for <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> would not fail to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new and conſummate the connexion. To this I gave no credit, and therefore made no reply. He then requeſted me to accept a purſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray my expenſes, during his abſence, which I rejected with diſdain; and he departed. The diſtreſs and deſpair of my mind were inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. For ſome days, I reſigned myſelf entirely to the agonizing pangs of grief. My parents imputed my dejection to Florimel's departure, and ſtrove to conſole me. It was not long, however, before my mother diſcovered the real cauſe. In her, reſentment gave place to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion; but the anger of my father could not be appeaſed. He abſolutely forbad me his preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for ſome time; but my mother at length prevailed on him to ſee, and aſſure me of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs

and reſtoration to favour, if I would conſent to renounce and diſown my child; to which, not then knowing the force of maternal affection, I readily conſented. This place was privately procured for me, and hither, under pretence of ſpending a month or two with a friend in the country, I retired. To-morrow my dear babe is to be taken from me! It is to be put to nurſe, I know not where! All I am told is, that it ſhall be well taken care of! Conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will its moans haunt my imagination, while I am deprived even of the hope of miniſtering to its wants; but muſt leave it to execrate the hour which gave it birth, and deprived it of a parent's attention and kindneſs.</p>

               <p>By this time I was ſummoned to tea; when, giving all the conſolation in my power to the unhappy Clarinda, I rejoined my company; and to prevent their inquiſitiveneſs about my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, told them I had been with a ſick woman, upon whom I accidentally intruded when I firſt came in; and that ſhe had detained me, all this time, by a recital of her complaints and misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. This account ſatisfied their curioſity; but the melancholy into which my mind had been thrown was not eaſily diſſipated; nor could I, without doing violence to my feelings, put on the appearance of my uſual cheerfulneſs and eaſe.</p>

                  <salute>MY DEAR FRIEND,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I WAS much affected by the woe-fraught tale which you gave me in your laſt. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not too much regret that ſuch inſtances of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and folly are ever exhibited. They are alike diſgraceful to both ſexes, and demonſtrate the debaſing and fatal tendency of the paſſions, when ſuffered to predominate.</p>
               <p>Your obſervations upon our ſex I believe to be juſt, though many would probably deem them ſevere. However, I think it not much to the honor of the maſculine character, which the God of nature deſigned for a defence and ſafeguard to female virtue and happineſs, to take advantage of the tender affection of the unſuſpecting and too credulous fair; and, in return for her love and confidence, perfidiouſly to deſtroy her peace of mind, and deprive her of that reputation, which might have rendered her a uſeful and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namental member of ſociety. True, we ought to take warning by ſuch examples of treachery and deceit; yet, how much more conducive to the honor and happineſs of our ſpecies, were there no occaſion to apprehend ſuch ungenerous requitals of our ſincerity and frankneſs!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="unknown:033748_0192_0FF9313A8C695A58"/>Yeſterday, my mamma took the liberty to read that part of your letter, which contains the ſtory of Clarinda, to her pupils, and to make ſuch comments upon it as the ſubject ſuggeſted; dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which we could not but obſerve the extreme emotion of one of the miſſes, a moſt amiable girl of about ſixteen. When the paragraph re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting Clarinda's diſowning her child was read, ſhe haſtily roſe, and in broken accents begged leave to withdraw. This was granted, without any inquiry into the cauſe; though our curioſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, as you may well ſuppoſe, was much excited. After we were diſmiſſed, my mamma prevailed on her to tell the reaſon of her agitation.</p>
               <p>"I am," ſaid ſhe, "the illegitimate offspring of parents, whom I am told are people of fortune and faſhion. The fear of diſgrace overcame the dictates of natural affection, and induced my mother to abandon me in my infancy. She accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly gave me away, with a large ſum of money, which ſhe vainly imagined would procure me kind and good treatment. But, unhappily for me, the people to whom I was conſigned, avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves of their ſecurity from inſpection and inquiry, abuſed the truſt repoſed in them, and expoſed me to the greateſt hardſhips. As they were perſons of vulgar minds and unfeeling hearts, they did not commiſerate my friendleſs condition. My quick ſenſibility incurred their diſpleaſure or deriſion. I was often inſultingly
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:033748_0193_0FF931416ADD2CD0"/>
reproached with the misfortune of my birth; while the tears which theſe ungenerous reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions extorted from me, were either mocked or puniſhed. I had a thirſt for knowledge; but they allowed me no time for acquiring it, alleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they could not ſupport me in idleneſs, but that I muſt earn my living, as they did their's, by hard labour. Oppreſſed by theſe inſults, I bore the galling yoke of their authority with the utmoſt impatience. When ſcreened from obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, my tears flowed without reſtraint; and the idea of my parents' cruelty, in thus ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to infamy and wretchedneſs, continually haunted my imagination. Sometimes I fancied my mother in view, and, expoſing my tattered raiment, expoſtulated with her concerning the indignities I ſuffered, and the unreaſonable hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of leaving me to bear all the puniſhment of my guilty birth! At other times I painted to myſelf a father, in ſome gentleman of pleaſing aſpect; and fondly indulged the momentary tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of throwing myſelf at the feet of one, whom I could call by that venerable and endearing name! Too ſoon, however, did the reverſe of parental tenderneſs awake me from my deluſive reveries.</p>
               <p>"In this manner I lingered away my exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, till I was twelve years old; when going, one day, to the houſe of a gentleman in the neighbourhood, to which I was often ſent to ſell
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:033748_0194_0FF93170E9D5F218"/>
herbs, and other trifles, I was directed into the parlour, where the moſt beautiful ſight in nature opened to my view; while the contraſt between my own ſituation, and that of children bleſſed with affectionate parents, gave me the moſt pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſenſations. The lady of the houſe was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by her four ſons, the eldeſt of whom was reading leſſons, which ſhe moſt pathetically inculcated upon all. As the door was open, I ſtood ſome minutes unobſerved; and was ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the tender accents in which her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions were imparted, and the cheerful obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience with which they were received, that I had no diſpoſition to interrupt them.</p>
               <p>"At length I was ſeen, and bid to come in. But, when queſtioned about my errand, I was ſo abſorbed in the contemplation of maternal and filial love, exhibited in this happy group, that my tongue refuſed utterance, and I burſt into tears. The children gathered around, and inquired what ailed the poor little girl? But when the lady took me by the hand, and kindly aſked what was the matter, I could not reſtrain or conceal my feelings. When my tears had relieved me, I related the cauſe of my grief; deſcribing my own ſituation, and the effect which its contraſt had produced on my mind.</p>
               <p>"She was affected by my ſtory, and ſeemed pleaſed with my ſenſibility; while the children lamented my misfortunes, and artleſsly requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:033748_0195_0FF931950F125278"/>
their mamma to let me come and live with them.</p>
               <p>"Little did I then expect ſo great a favour; but to my ſurpriſe, as well as joy, Mrs.—, the lady of whom I have been ſpeaking, and by whom I am put under your care, came, a few days after, and aſked the people where I lived, if they were willing to part with me. By their conſent ſhe took me home, and has ever ſince treated me like a child.</p>
               <p>"I am now happy beyond expreſſion. My gratitude to my benefactreſs, who, guided by a wife and good Providence, has ſnatched me from obſcurity and miſery, and given me ſo many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages for improvement, is unbounded.</p>
               <p>"But the idea that any helpleſs innocent ſhould be unnaturally expoſed to the ſufferings which I have experienced, is inſupportably diſtreſſing to my imagination.</p>
               <p>"Let my ſtory, if poſſible, be told to Clarinda, that ſhe may be induced to have compaſſion upon her defenceleſs offspring."</p>
               <p>You are at liberty, therefore, my dear Julia, to make what uſe you pleaſe of this letter. I ſhall make no comments upon the ſubject of it, nor add any thing more to its length, but that I am affectionately your's.</p>

                  <salute>DEAR ANNA,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>MY contemplated viſit to Harmony-Grove muſt be deferred. A ſevere illneſs has lately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined my mamma to her chamber. This claimed all my time and attention, and called me to a new ſcene of care; that of a family, which I was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſuperintend during her indiſpoſition. Her recovery has, at length, reſtored tranquillity and joy to our abode; but ſhe has not yet reſumed the direction of her houſehold affairs. To this, ſhe tells me, ſhe is reconciled by the hope, that expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience may render me an adept in domeſtic econ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omy. Indeed, Anna, I think this an eſſential branch of female education; and I queſtion whether it can be acquired by mere ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To me it is plain, that every lady ought to have ſome practice in the management of a family, before ſhe takes upon herſelf the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant truſt.</p>
               <p>Do not many of the miſtakes and infelicities of life ariſe from a deficiency in this point?</p>
               <p>Young ladies of faſhion are not obliged to the taſk, and have too ſeldom any inclination to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form duties which require ſo much time and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; and with which, perhaps, they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciouſly
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:033748_0197_0FF931D12C3FDD98"/>
been taught to connect the idea of ſervility. Hence it is, that when called to preſide over families, they commit many errors, during their novitiate, at leaſt, which are alike detrimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to their intereſt and happineſs. How neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary is it, then, to avoid this complication of evils by a ſeaſonable application to thoſe offices of houſewifery, which may one day become our province.</p>
               <p>Early riſing, I find a great aſſiſtance in my preſent occupation. It is almoſt incredible how much may be gained by a diligent improvement of thoſe hours which are but too commonly loſt in ſleep. I aroſe this morning with the dawn. The ſerenity of the ſky and the fragrance of the air invited me abroad. The calmneſs which uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally prevailed ſerved to tranquillize my mind, while the receding ſhades of night, and the riſing beams of day formed a contraſted aſſemblage of the beautiful, the ſplendid, the ſolemn, and the ſublime. The ſilence which pervaded the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding ſcenery was interrupted only by the melody of the feathered ſongſters, who ſeemed to rejoice in this undiſturbed opportunity of praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Maker. My heart expanded with grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude and love to the all-bountiful Author of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and ſo abſorbed was I in the moſt delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful meditations, that I ſaw with regret the hour approaching which muſt again call me to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

               </opener>
               <p>I SINCERELY thank you for your affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate letter, by the laſt poſt, and for the book with which it was accompanied. The very title is ſufficient to rouſe the feelings and attract the attention of the patriotic mind. Beacon-Hill claims a conſpicuous place in the hiſtory of our country. The ſubject of this poem muſt be highly intereſting to every true American; while the genius it diſplays cannot fail to gratify every poetical taſte. Philenia's talents juſtly entitle her to a rank among the literary ornaments of Columbia.</p>
               <p>I have been reviewing Millot's Elements of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Modern Hiſtory; and recommend it to your re-peruſal. It is undoubtedly the moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full compendium extant. The tedious minute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and prolix details of ſieges and battles, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociations and treaties, which fatigue the reader and oppreſs the memory, in moſt works of the kind, are happily avoided in this; while the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, ſimplicity, conciſeneſs and perſpicuity of the ſtyle, render it intelligible to every capacity, and pleaſing to every taſte. To thoſe who have a reliſh for hiſtory, but want leiſure to give it full ſcope, Millot is well calculated to afford both
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:033748_0200_0FF9329106E3AC00"/>
information and entertainment. It is an objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, commonly made by our ſex to ſtudies of this nature, that they are dry and elaborate; that they yield little or no exerciſe to the more ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faculties of the mind; that the attention is confined to an unintereſting and barren detail of facts, while the imagination pants in vain for the flowery wreaths of decoration.</p>
               <p>This is a plauſible excuſe for thoſe who read only for amuſement, and are willing to ſacrifice reaſon, and the enlargement of their minds, to the gaudy phantom of a day; but it can never be ſatisfactory to the perſon, who wiſhes to combine utility with pleaſure, and dignity with relaxation. Hiſtory improves the underſtanding, and furniſhes a knowledge of human nature and human events, which may be uſeful, as well as ornamental, through life. "Hiſtory," ſays the late celebrated Ganganelli, "brings together all ages and all mankind into one point of view. Preſenting a charming landſcape to the mental eye, it gives colour to the thoughts, ſoul to the actions, and life to the dead; and brings them again upon the ſtage of the world, as if they were again living; but with this difference, that it is not to flatter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to judge them."</p>
               <p>The duties and avocations of our ſex will not often admit of a cloſe and connected courſe of reading. Yet a general knowledge of the moſt neceſſary ſubjects may undoubtedly be gained,
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:033748_0201_0FF8C8F0E12ACC88"/>
even in our leiſure hours; provided we beſtow them not on works of mere taſte and fancy, but on the peruſal of books calculated to enrich the underſtanding with durable acquiſitions.</p>

               <p>SINCE I wrote you laſt, I have made an agreeable viſit to my good friend, Sylvia Star. After rambling in the fields and gardens till we were fatigued, we went into her brother's library. He was in a ſtudious attitude, but gave us a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite reception. We are come to ſolicit a portion of your repaſt, Amintor, ſaid I. Be ſo kind as to furniſh us with ſome inſtructive page, which combines entertainment and utility; and while it informs the mind, delights the imagination. I am not happy enough to know your taſte reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing books, ſaid he; and, therefore, may not make a proper ſelection. Here, however, is an author highly ſpoken of by a lady, who has lately added to the number of literary publications; handing me Sterne's Sentimental Journey. I cloſed and returned the book. You have indeed miſtaken my taſte, ſaid I. Wit, blended with indelicacy, never meets my approbation. While the fancy is allured, and the paſſions awakened, by this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic humouriſt, the foundations of virtue are inſidiouſly undermined, and modeſt dignity inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly betrayed. Well, ſaid he, ſmiling, perhaps you are ſeriouſly inclined. If ſo, this volume of ſermons may poſſibly pleaſe you. Still leſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined

I. The ſerious mind muſt turn with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt from the levity which pervades theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, and from the indecent flow of mirth and humour, which converts even the ſacred wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and the moſt ſolemn ſubjects of religion, into frolic and buffoonery. Since ſuch is your opinion of this celebrated writer, ſaid he, I will not inſult your feelings by offering you his Triſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram Shandy. But here is another wit, famous for his "<hi>purity.</hi>" Yes, ſaid <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

As far as grammat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical correctneſs and ſimplicity of language can deſerve the epithet, his advocates may enjoy their ſentiments unmoleſted; but, in any other ſenſe of the word, he has certainly no claim to "<hi>purity.</hi>" I conceive his works, notwithſtanding, to be much leſs pernicious in their tendency, than thoſe of Sterne. They are not ſo enchanting in their nature, nor ſo ſubtle in their effects. In the one, the noxious inſinuations of licentious wit are concealed under the artful blandiſhments of ſympathetic ſenſibility; while we at once recoil from the rude aſſault which is made upon our delicacy, by the roughneſs and vulgarity of the other.</p>

                  <salute>DEAR ANNA,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I RETIRED, after breakfaſt this morning, determined to indulge myſelf in my favourite amuſement, and write you a long letter. I had juſt mended my pen and folded my paper, when I was informed that three ladies waited for me in the parlour. I ſtepped down and found Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinda P—, Fulvia F—, and Delia S—. They were gaily dreſſed, and ſtill more gaily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. "We called," ſaid they, "to invite you, Miſs Maria, to join our party for a ſhopping tour." Loath to have the ideas diſſipated, which I had collected in my pericranium, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of tranſmitting to a beloved ſiſter, I decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned accepting their invitation; alleging that I had no occaſion to purchaſe any thing to-day; and therefore begged to be excuſed from accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying them. They laughed at my reaſon for not engaging in the expedition. "Buying," ſaid their principal ſpeaker, "is no conſiderable part of our plan, I aſſure you. Amuſement is what we are after. We frankly acknowledge it a delightful gratification of our vanity, to traverſe Cornhill, to receive the obſequious congees, and to call forth the gallantry and activity of the beaux be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the counter; who, you muſt know, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:033748_0207_0FF932F51ACC90B0"/>
alert when we belles appear. The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of our feathers, and the attractive airs we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, command the profoundeſt attention, both of maſter and apprentices; who, duped by our appearance, ſuffer leſs brilliant cuſtomers to wait, or even to depart without notice, till we have tumbled over and refuſed half the goods in the ſhop. We then bid a very civil adieu; expreſs our regret at having given ſo much trouble; are aſſured, in return, that it has been rather a pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure; and leave them their labour for their pains."</p>
               <p>A moſt inſignificant amuſement this, ſaid I to myſelf! How little can it redound to the honor and happineſs of theſe unthinking girls, thus to ſquander their time in folly's giddy maze! They undoubtedly wiſh to attract eclat; but they would do well to remember thoſe words of the ſatiriſt, which, with the alteration of a ſingle term, may be applied to them:</p>
               <l>"<hi>Columbia's</hi> daughters, much more fair than nice,</l>
               <l>Too fond of admiration, loſe their price;</l>
               <l>Worn in the public eye, give cheap delight</l>
               <l>To <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and tarniſh to the ſated ſight."</l>
               <p>Viewing their conduct in this light, I with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood their ſolicitations, though I palliated my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal in ſuch a manner as to give no umbrage.</p>
               <p>Of all expedients to kill time, this appears to me, as I know it will to you, the moſt ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and abſurd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="210" facs="unknown:033748_0208_0FF932FAF74E2848"/>What poſſible ſatisfaction can reſult from ſuch a practice? It certainly fatigues the body; and is it any advantage to the mind? Does it enlarge the underſtanding, inſpire uſeful ideas, or furniſh a ſource of pleaſing reflection? True, it may gratify a vitiated imagination, and exhilarate a light and trifling mind. But theſe ought to be reſtrained and regulated by reaſon and judgment, rather than indulged.</p>
               <p>I wiſh thoſe ladies, who make pleaſure the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme object of their purſuit, and argue in vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of their conduct, that
<q>
                     <l>Pleaſure is good, and <hi>they</hi> for pleaſure made,</l>
                  </q>
would confine, themſelves to that ſpecies which
<q>
                     <l>Neither bluſhes, nor expires.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The domeſtic virtues, if duly cultivated, might certainly occupy thoſe hours, which they are now ſolicitous to diſſipate, both with profit and delight. "But it is time enough to be domeſticated," ſay they, "when we are placed at the head of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and neceſſarily confined to care and labour."</p>
               <p>Should not the mind, however, be ſeaſonably inured to the ſphere of life which Providence aſſigns us?</p>
               <l>"To guide the pencil, turn th' inſtructive page;</l>
               <l>To lend new flavour to the fruitful year,</l>
               <l>And heighten nature's dainties; in their race</l>
               <l>To rear their graces into ſecond life;</l>
               <l>To give ſociety its higheſt taſte;</l>
               <l>

               <l>And, by ſubmiſſive wiſdom, modeſt ſkill,</l>
               <l>With every gentle care-eluding art,</l>
               <l>To raiſe the virtues, animate the bliſs,</l>
               <l>And ſweeten all the toils of human life.</l>
               <l>This be the female dignity and praiſe."</l>
               <p>A proper attention to theſe neceſſary duties and embelliſhments would not only correct this rambling diſpoſition, but happily leave neither leiſure nor temptation for its indulgence.</p>
               <p>I intended to have given you ſome account of my agreeable viſit here; but the <hi>chit-chat</hi> of the ladies I have mentioned, has occupied a large portion of my time this morning, and an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to dine abroad claims the reſt.</p>
               <p>I hope ſoon to embrace you in our beloved re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, and again to enjoy the ſweets of my native home.</p>

               <p>THE extracts which you tranſmitted to me in your laſt kind letter, my dear Sophia, from your favourite author, Doctor Young, correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponded exactly with the ſolemnity infuſed into my mind by the funeral of a neighbour, from which I had juſt returned.</p>
               <p>I agree with you, that the Night-Thoughts are good devotional exerciſes. It is impoſſible to read them with that degree of attention which they merit, without being affected by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant and awful ſubjects on which they treat. But Young, after all, is always too abſtruſe, and in many inſtances, too gloomy for me. The moſt elaborate application is neceſſary to the comprehenſion of his meaning and deſign; which, when diſcovered, often tend rather to depreſs than to elevate the ſpirits.</p>
               <p>Thompſon is much better adapted to my taſte. Sentiment, elegance, perſpicuity, and ſublimity are all combined in his Seaſons. What an inimitable painter! How admirably he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the infinitely variegated beauties and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erations of nature! To the feeling and ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible heart they are preſented in the ſtrongeſt light. Nor is the energy of his language leſs perceivable, when he deſcribes the Deity riding
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:033748_0211_0FF9331097396B58"/>
on the wings of the wind, and directing the ſtormy tempeſt.</p>
               <l>"How chang'd the ſcene! In blazing height of noon,</l>
               <l>The ſun, oppreſs'd, is plung'd in thickeſt gloom;</l>
               <l>Still horror reigns, a diſmal twilight round,</l>
               <l>Of ſtruggling night and day malignant mix'd.</l>
               <l>Far to the hot equator crowding faſt,</l>
               <l>Where, highly rarefy'd, the yielding air</l>
               <l>Admits their ſtream, inceſſant vapours roll,</l>
               <l>Amazing clouds on clouds continual heap'd;</l>
               <l>Or whirl'd tempeſtuous by the guſty wind,</l>
               <l>Or ſilent, borne along, heavy and ſlow,</l>
               <l>With the big ſtores of ſtreaming oceans charg'd.</l>
               <l>Meantime, amid theſe upper ſeas, condenſ'd</l>
               <l>Around the cold aerial mountain's brow,</l>
               <l>And by conflicting winds together daſh'd,</l>
               <l>The thunder holds his black tremendous throne.</l>
               <l>From cloud to cloud the rending lightnings rage;</l>
               <l>Till, in the furious elemental war</l>
               <l>Diſſolv'd, the whole precipitated maſs</l>
               <l>Unbroken floods and torrents pours."</l>
               <p>Conſcious of our own weakneſs and depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, we can hardly fail to adore and to fear that Divine Power, whoſe agency this imagery exhibits to our minds. Nor are the devout af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of our hearts leſs excited, when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the ſame glorious Being arrayed in love, and accommodating the regular ſucceſſion of ſummer and winter, ſeed-time and harveſt to our convenience and comfort.

world, and diffuſes alacrity and joy throughout the animal, and even rational creation, we invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untarily exclaim with the poet,</p>

               <p>BY <hi>her</hi> deſire, in conjunction with my own inclination, I inform you that Harriot Henly is no more—Yeſterday ſhe gave her hand, and renounced her name together; threw aſide the ſprightly girl we have been ſo long accuſtomed to admire, and ſubſtituted in her place the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified and reſpectable head of a family, in Mrs. Farmington.</p>
               <p>Have I not loſt my amiable friend and aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate? Will not her change of ſituatiton tend to leſſen our intercourſe, and to alienate our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections?</p>
               <p>When I contemplate the ſocial circle, ſo firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cemented in the bands of friendſhip, at the boarding ſchool, where the moſt perfect har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, eaſe and ſatisfaction preſided, I recoil at the idea of becoming leſs dear, leſs intereſting, and leſs neceſſary to each other. It is with the utmoſt reluctance that I admit the idea of rivals to that affection and benevolence which we have, ſo long, and ſo ſincerely interchanged.</p>
               <p>The charm however is broken. Harriot is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready married; and my friends are extremely ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous that I ſhould follow her example. But in a connexion which requires ſo many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions

before it is formed, and ſuch uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted circumſpection and prudence afterwards; the great uncertainty of the event inſpires me with timidity and apprehenſion.</p>
               <p>Harriot put into my hands, and I read with pleaſure, the book which you recommended to her on the ſubject. But ſtill we wiſhed for your inſtruction and advice. The ſentiments of a perſon ſo dear and intereſting to us, are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly calculated to engage our attention, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence our conduct. Relying, too, on your judgment and experience, your forming pen may render us more worthy objects of attachment.</p>

               <p>Diſparity of tempers, among other things which were then ſuggeſted, and which you will doubtleſs recollect, was repreſented, as tending to render life uncomfortable. But there are other diſpari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which may be equally hoſtile to your peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="unknown:033748_0217_0FF9334E6E9BF220"/>Diſparity of years is very apt to occaſion the indulgence of paſſions deſtructive of conjugal fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity. The great difference between the ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fancy, vivacity, and enterprize of youth, and the deliberate caution, phlegmatic coldneſs, and ſententious wiſdom of age, render them very unpleaſant companions to each other. Marriage between perſons of theſe oppoſite deſcriptions is commonly the reſult of pecuniary motives, with one party, at leaſt: the ſuſpicion of this, in the other, muſt neceſſarily produce diſcontent, uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and diſaffection.</p>
               <p>Age is naturally jealous of reſpect, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of being ſlighted. The moſt trifling and unmeaning inattentions will therefore be conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amiſs. For an exceſſive deſire of being objects of ſupreme regard is almoſt invariably accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a ſtrong perſuaſion of being the reverſe. Hence accuſations, reproaches, and reſtraints, on the one ſide, produce diſguſt, reſentment and ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enation on the other, till mutual and unceaſing wretchedneſs enſue. Indeed, where intereſt alone, without this inequality of years, is the principal inducement, marriage is ſeldom happy. Eſteem and love are independent of wealth and its appendages. They are not to be ſold or bought. The conjugal relation is ſo near and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting; the mind, as well as the perſon, is ſo intimately concerned in it, that ſomething more
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:033748_0218_0FF9336B2012B180"/>
ſubſtantial and engaging than gold is requiſite to make it a bleſſing.</p>
               <p>Marriage, being the commencement of a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic life, beſide the many agreeable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances attending it, has its peculiar cares and troubles, which require the ſolace of a compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion actuated by better principles, and poſſeſſed of more amiable endowments than outward ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and magnificence can afford. In the hour of ſickneſs and diſtreſs, riches, it is true, can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow bodily comforts and cordials; but can they be made an equivalent for the tender ſympathy, the endearing kindneſs, and the alleviating atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a boſom friend, kindly aſſiduous to eaſe our pains, animate our proſpects, and beguile the languid moments which elude all other conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? The ſorrows as well as the joys of a family ſtate, are often ſuch as none but a boſom friend can participate. The heart muſt be enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged before it can repoſe with eaſe and confidence. To a lady of ſenſibility, the confinement of the body, without the conſent and union of accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing minds, muſt be a ſtate of inexpreſſible wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.</p>
               <p>Another ſituation, not leſs to be deplored, is a connexion with the immoral and profane.</p>
               <p>How ſhocking muſt it be, to hear that ſacred NAME, which you revere and love, conſtantly treated with levity and irreverence! And how painful the neceſſity of being conſtrained, for the
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:033748_0219_0FF933891FFF8B28"/>
ſake of peace, to witneſs in ſilence; and without even the appearance of diſapprobation, the moſt ſhameful outrages upon religion and virtue! May you never taſte the bitterneſs of this evil!</p>
               <p>Intemperance is a vice, which one would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine no lady would overlook in a ſuitor. But, ſtrange to tell! there are thoſe, even among our own ſex, who think and ſpeak of inebriation in the other, at the jovial and well-furniſhed board, as a mark of conviviality and good fellowſhip!</p>
               <p>What, then, is the diſtinguiſhing badge of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity? Can that reaſon, which alone raiſes us ſuperior to the brute creation, be wantonly ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rificed with impunity; yea, with reputation?</p>
               <p>How degrading and how dreadful muſt this enormity appear to an intereſted, affectionate, and virtuous wife! What agonizing pangs of mortification and anguiſh muſt ſhe endure, when ſhe meets him, in whoſe ſociety ſhe delights, whoſe return ſhe has anticipated with impatience, and whoſe happineſs and honor are the moving ſprings of her life, intoxicated with wine; the powers of his mind ſuſpended by the poiſonous cup, and every faculty abſorbed in the deadly draught! What a perpetual ſource of dread and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion muſt hence ariſe; and how often muſt the bluſh of indignant virtue and wounded delicacy be called forth!</p>
               <p>The gameſter is an equally dangerous compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion. His family is robbed, not only of his company
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:033748_0220_0FF932494DC03BB0"/>
and his talents, but of that property, to the ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efit of which they have an indiſputable claim. His earnings are ſquandered among worthleſs and profligate aſſociates abroad; while the faithful partner of his life, and perhaps, too, a riſing off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, languiſh at home for want of bread!</p>
               <p>How fatal is the tendency of ſuch examples! How can that father inculcate the duties of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, virtue and decency, who exhibits the reverſe of each in his own conduct? And under what an unſpeakable diſadvantage muſt that mother labour, in the inſtruction and education of her children, whoſe admonitions, counſels, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections are practically counteracted by him who ought to bear an equal ſhare of the burden! The government and ſuperintendence of a fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily are objects of ſuch magnitude and import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that the union and co-operation of its heads are indiſpenſably neceſſary. It is a little commonwealth; and if internal feuds and diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ariſe, anarchy and confuſion muſt enſue.</p>
               <p>Domeſtic happineſs is the foundation of every other ſpecies. At times, indeed, we may enjoy ourſelves abroad, among our friends; but a good heart will return home, as to the ſeat of felicity.</p>
               <l>"—Home is the reſort</l>
               <l>Of love, of joy, of peace and plenty, where,</l>
               <l>Supporting and ſupported, poliſh'd friends</l>
               <l>And dear relations mingle into bliſs."</l>
               <p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="unknown:033748_0221_0FF933BCD8471680"/>Since ſo much, then, depends upon a judicious choice, how important is it, that you examine well before you decide; and that you diſpenſe with no quality in the man to whom you ſhall give your hand, which is eſſential to the virtue and happineſs of your life. For this purpoſe, conſult your judgment, rather than your fancy; and ſuffer not ſuperficial accompliſhments, but ſolid merit to preponderate.</p>
               <p>I have now endeavoured to point out the moſt apparent and threatening dangers to which you may be expoſed. But though theſe are avoided, many unforeſeen accidents will doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs occur to cloud your ſanguine hopes. Theſe, when there are no vices to produce them, may ariſe from follies, and from the indulgence of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous expectations. Little miſunderſtandings ſometimes occaſion diſagreements which termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in coldneſs and diſaffection, and plant a root of bitterneſs which can hardly be eradicated.</p>
               <p>Let prudence, therefore, be your pole-ſtar, when you enter the married ſtate. Watch with the greateſt circumſpection over yourſelf; and always exerciſe the tendereſt affection, the moſt unwearied patience, and the moſt cheerful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcence in the treatment of your companion. Guard eſpecially againſt being affected by thoſe little inattentions and foibles, which too often give pain and umbrage without deſign; and produce thoſe remonſtrances, criminations, and
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:033748_0222_0FF933E2EA836C40"/>
retorts, which are the great inlets of ſtrife, and bane of love.</p>
               <p>You muſt bear, with calmneſs, every thing that the ſincereſt deſire of peace can dictate; and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly avoid every expreſſion, and even look, which may irritate and offend. Your own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, you will conſider ſo intimately connected with that of your huſband, as to be inſeparable; and conſequently, that all your hopes of comfort in this life, and perhaps, too, in the next, depend upon your conducting with propriety and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom towards him.</p>
               <p>I take the liberty, through you, to convey my congratulations to Mrs. Farmington. May her change of condition be happy, to the full extent of our moſt ſanguine expectations, and benev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent wiſhes. I fully intended writing her on the ſubject, but have unwarily beſtowed ſo much time upon you, that for the preſent, I muſt fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the pleaſure. Some things in this letter, which you will doubtleſs communicate, are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to her caſe. Theſe ſhe will receive as friendly hints from me; and I am confident that her known diſcretion will continue to ſhed a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign and engaging influence upon her whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, and render her uniformly reſpected and beloved.</p>
               <p>The bearer is waiting, and I can only add, that I remain your ſincere and affectionate friend.</p>

               <p>THE pleaſing hope with which you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired me, when we parted laſt, of receiving a viſit from you in town, has been conſtantly cheriſhed. I have anticipated your arrival with the utmoſt impatience; but have endeavoured, notwithſtanding, to beguile the ſlow-paced hours by a uſeful and pleaſing occupation; the revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of my geographical ſtudies.</p>
               <p>My papa has kindly procured me Doctor Morſe's laſt, and much improved edition of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Geography, which, with the aſſiſtance of a pair of globes he poſſeſſed, has afforded me the moſt delightful entertainment. When at ſchool, I thought this the moſt agreeable ſtudy allotted me; never deeming it a taſk, but an amuſement.</p>
               <p>It affords me, as it muſt every true American, the ſincereſt pleaſure to be furniſhed with the means of acquiring this favourite ſcience, by my own countryman; and the ſpirit of Columbian independence exults in my boſom, at the idea of being able to gain an accurate acquaintance with my own and other countries, without recourſe to the labours of foreigners.</p>
               <p>I think the preſent generation under ſpecial obligations to the active induſtry of Dr. Morſe,
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:033748_0224_0FF9342D956FEA40"/>
in providing us with that neceſſary and rich fund of information, which his Geography and Gaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etteer contain. From theſe ſources we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive a ſufficient knowledge of the world we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit, without departing from our domeſtic ſphere.</p>
               <p>Come, then, my dear Cleora, and without fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue or expenſe, we will make the tour of the globe together. After inveſtigating the local ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of different and diſtant climes, we will turn to the hiſtoric page, and examine the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, government, character, and improvements of their inhabitants. We will traverſe the frozen waſtes of the frigid zones, and the burning ſands of the equatorial region; then return and bleſs the temperate and happy medium in which we are placed; and, caſting an eye around, exult in our peculiar advantages of ſoil and ſituation, peace and good government, virtue and religion.</p>
               <p>The fine mornings of this ſeaſon afford many delightful hours, before the heat of the day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxes the mind and enervates the body. Come, then, enjoy and improve theſe, in concert with your faithful and affectionate friend,</p>

                  <salute>DEAR MATILDA,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>LAST Thurſday, after having concluded the uſual occupations and ſedentary amuſements of the day, I walked out, towards evening, to enjoy the benefit of a cool and fragrant air, and the ſerenity and beauty of thoſe rural ſcenes which have a powerful tendency to ſoothe and tranquillize the mind. When I had rambled in the fields, to a conſiderable diſtance, I croſſed into the road, to return home free from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience of the dew, which had begun to fall.</p>
               <p>I had not proceeded far, when I obſerved a female, who had the appearance of youth and misfortune, ſitting by the wall in a penſive atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, with an infant in her lap. When I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached her, ſhe aroſe, and in the moſt humble and pathetic accents, beſought me to direct her to ſome ſhelter, where ſhe might repoſe her weary limbs for the night. The aſpect and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of diſtreſs awakened my compaſſion. To know ſhe really needed charity, was a ſufficient inducement with me to beſtow it, without ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulouſly inquiring whether ſhe deſerved it or not. I therefore told her to follow me, and I would conduct her to a lodging.</p>
               <p>As we walked on, I queſtioned her reſpecting the place of her nativity, her parentage, and the
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:033748_0226_0FF93472267FD1D8"/>
reaſon of her being reduced to the ſituation in which I had found her. She informed me that ſhe was born in Ireland; that her parents brought her into this country, before her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance; that while ſhe was very young, they both died, and left her to the protection and mercy of ſtrangers; that ſhe was bandied from one to another, in the village where Providence had caſt her lot, till ſhe was able to earn her own living: "and ſince that time," ſaid ſhe, "I believe the character of an honeſt and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous girl will not be refuſed me." How then, ſaid I, came you by this incumbrance? pointing to the child. "In that," replied ſhe, "I am verily guilty. Brought up in ignorance of thoſe principles of decency, virtue and religion, which have kept <hi>you</hi> innocent, Madam, I was ruined by a deceitful man, who, under the maſk of love, and with the moſt ſolemn promiſes of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, betrayed my confidence, and left me to reap the bitter fruits of my credulity. The woman where I lived, when ſhe diſcovered my ſituation, ordered me to leave her houſe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately. It was no matter, ſaid ſhe, how much I ſuffered, or what became of me. On my own head, ſhe told me, my iniquity ſhould fall; ſhe would not lighten the burden, if it were in her power.</p>
               <p>"Some of the neighbours informed me, that ſhe had reaſon to be ſevere upon my fault, being once in the ſame condemnation herſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="229" facs="unknown:033748_0227_0FF934958B7AB0B0"/>"Having no friend who could aſſiſt me, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the ſelectmen of the town, who provided for me till I was able to work, and then told me I muſt ſhift for myſelf; offering, however, to keep the child, which I refuſed, being determined it ſhould never ſuffer for want of a mother's care, while I had life.</p>
               <p>"I am now wandering in purſuit of employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the labour of my hands may ſupport myſelf and little one. This has been often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied me, either for fear my child ſhould be troubleſome, or becauſe my character was ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. I have ſometimes ſuffered ſo much from fatigue and want, that I have deſpaired of relief, and heartily wiſhed both myſelf and my babe in the grave."</p>
               <p>On examination, I found her knowledge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined entirely to domeſtic drudgery; that ſhe had never been taught either to read or write. She appears, notwithſtanding, to have good natural ſenſe; and a quickneſs of apprehenſion, and readineſs of expreſſion, ſeldom equalled in her ſphere of life.</p>
               <p>I conducted her into the kitchen, and deſired ſhe might have ſupper, and a bed provided for her. My mamma, whoſe benevolent heart and liberal hand are always ready to relieve the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitous, was pleaſed to approve my conduct; and having kept her through the next day, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved her diſpoſition and behaviour, hired her as
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:033748_0228_0FF934BBCBBC0740"/>
a ſervant; and we have reaſon to believe, from her apparent fidelity and grateful exertions, that our kindneſs will be well repaid. I have even extended my charity further, and undertaken to teach her to read. She is very tractable; and I expect to be amply rewarded for my labour, by her improvements.</p>
               <p>Indeed, Matilda, it is melancholy to ſee our fellow-creatures reared up, like the brute crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; neither inſtructed how to live above their animal appetites, nor how to die as Chriſtians, when they have finiſhed their toilſome career!</p>
               <p>This girl is only ſeventeen. Her age, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as well as her docility and ſubmiſſiveneſs, encourage the pleaſing hope of reſtoring her to the paths of rectitude and peace. I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, as opportunity offers, to inſtil into her ſuſceptible mind, the principles of virtue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and, perhaps, I may lead her to the love and practice of both, and render her a uſeful member of ſociety. Her fate impreſſes, more forcibly than ever, on my mind, the importance of a good education, and the obligations it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers. Had you or I been ſubjected to the ſame ignorance, and the ſame temptations, who can ſay that we ſhould have conducted better? How many fall for want of the directing hand of that parental love and friendſhip, with which we are bleſſed! Contraſting our ſituation with her's, how much have <hi>we</hi> to account for, and how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:033748_0229_0FF934D6EBC56608"/>
ſhall <hi>we</hi> be, if we violate our duty, and forfeit our dignity, as reaſonable creatures!</p>
               <p>That extreme bitterneſs and acrimony, which is ſometimes indulged, againſt perſons who are unhappily ſeduced from the way of virtue, may operate as a diſcouragement to all deſigns and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to regain it: whereas, the ſoothing voice of forgiveneſs, and the conſequent proſpect of being reſtored to reputation and uſefulneſs, might rouſe the attention, and call forth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions of ſome, at leaſt, who, through deſpair of retrieving their characters, abandon themſelves to vice, and adopt a courſe, alike diſgraceful to their ſex, and to human nature.</p>
               <p>But, though I advocate the principles of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthropy and Chriſtian charity, as extending to ſome very ſpecial caſes, I am far from ſuppoſing this fault generally capable of the leaſt extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Whatever allowance may be made for thoſe, whoſe ignorance occaſions their ruin, no excuſe can be offered for others, whoſe education, and opportunities for knowing the world and themſelves, have taught them a better leſſon.</p>
               <p>I need not, however, be at the pains to enforce this truth upon you: and, as my head is ſo full of the ſubject, that I have no diſpoſition to write upon any thing elſe, I will put an end to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherent ſcroll, by annexing the name of your ſincere and faithful friend,</p>

               </opener>
               <p>HAPPENING to be in my chamber, this morning, the maid came running up ſtairs in ſuch violent haſte, as to put herſelf fairly out of breath. Will you be ſo kind, Miſs Sophia, ſaid ſhe, as to lend me a quarter of a dollar? I put my hand into my pocket, and found I had no ſmall change. I have nothing leſs than a dollar, Suſan, ſaid I; but, if it is a matter of conſequence to you, I will go to my mamma, and procure it for you. She was loath to give me that trouble; but, if I would, it would really oblige her very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. Her ſolicitude excited my curioſity. Will you inform me what you want it for? ſaid I. O yes; ſhe believed it was no harm—But there was a woman in the wood-houſe, who told for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes; and ſhe wiſhed to know her's, but could not without the money. A woman who tells fortunes! ſaid I. What fortunes? the paſt, or the future? The future, to be ſure, Ma'am, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined ſhe. Ay, how does ſhe know them? ſaid I. Has ſhe been let into the ſecret deſigns of Providence? or can ſhe divine the myſteries of fate? She tells fortunes by cards, Ma'am, ſaid ſhe; and I really believe ſhe tells true. Can you imagine, ſaid I, that a knowledge of your deſtiny in life, is to be gained from any poſſible arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:033748_0231_0FF935050445C7D0"/>
of a pack of cards? Why not, Ma'am? Many people have been told exactly what was to happen. You may depend on it, Suſan, ſaid I, you are deceived. The Almighty, who diſpoſes all events according to his ſovereign pleaſure, does not unveil futurity to mortals, eſpecially to <hi>ſuch</hi> mortals, who, by an idle vicious courſe of life, counteract his laws, and diſregard his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. I would willingly give you the money, twice told, if you needed it; but I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to your being impoſed on, by this worthleſs vagrant, who has no other deſign than to pick your pocket.</p>
               <p>The girl departed at theſe words; and, though I felt an emotion of regret at refuſing to gratify her, yet my reaſon and conſcience forbad my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acceſſary to the fraud.</p>
               <p>This curioſity to explore the hidden counſels of the Moſt High, prevails not only among ſervants, but even many, from whom better things might be expected, are under its infatuating influence.</p>
               <p>The Supreme Being has, for wiſe and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent reaſons, concealed from us the future inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of our lives. A humble reliance on his power and goodneſs, accompanied with a cheerful ſubmiſſion to the diſpenſations of his providence, is what the Lord our God requireth of us.</p>
               <p>I have heard my mamma relate an anecdote of a particular friend of her's, who was impoſed on very ſeriouſly in this way.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="234" facs="unknown:033748_0232_0FF9351F2F053B40"/>A gentleman, whom I ſhall call Sylvander, was very deeply in love with her; but his perſon, and, much more, his diſpoſition and manners, were extremely diſguſting to her. Averſe to the very idea of a connexion with him, ſhe accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly refuſed his addreſſes. Yet he had art ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to intereſt her friends in his behalf; who, pitying his ſituation, endeavoured to ſoften the heart of the obdurate fair. But in vain they ſtrove to conciliate her affections.</p>
               <p>In defiance of all oppoſition, however, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly obtruded his viſits, till ſhe reluctantly admitted them; and being ſomewhat coquettiſh, ſhe at times received him more benignly; which flattered his hopes of ultimately accompliſhing his wiſhes. Finding his ardent ſuit of but little avail, and perceiving that he made but ſmall progreſs towards gaining her favour, he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to art. Surpriſing her, one day; in cloſe confabulation with a fortune-teller, the idea im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſtruck him, that he might effect, through this mean, what all his aſſiduity and ſolicitations could never inſure. He communicated his plan to a female friend, who was equally the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of both parties. Directed by him, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with Sylvia on the ſubject; profeſſed her belief in the ſkill of theſe jugglers; and appeared deſirous of taking this meaſure to learn her fate. Sylvia joined in her opinion and wiſhes; and away they tripped together on the important er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand.
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:033748_0233_0FF9353B068C21D8"/>
Meanwhile, Sylvander had been to the fellow who was to reveal their deſtinies; and, bribing him to favour the deſign, left him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed what anſwers to make to their interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.</p>
               <p>They arrived, and propoſed their buſineſs. The mediums of information, a pack of cards, were brought forth, and myſteriouſly arranged. Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via's curioſity was on tip-toe. She liſtened with profound attention to his oracular wiſdom; and believed him really inſpired, when he told her, that her former lover, for whom ſhe had a great regard, was gone to a foreign country. This ſhe knew to be true, and therefore gave him full cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, when he added, that he would never live to return; and when he proceeded ſtill further to obſerve, that another gentleman of great merit now courted her; that ſhe was not fond of his addreſſes, but would ſoon ſee his worth and her own error; give him her hand, and be happy.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, he ſo artfully blended the paſt and preſent, which ſhe knew, with the future which Sylvander wiſhed, and had therefore dictated, that ſhe was firmly perſuaded he dealt with ſome inviſible power, and that fate had, indeed, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtined her to the arms of Sylvander. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of this, ſhe attended to his overtures more placidly, contemplated his perſon and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with leſs averſion, and endeavoured to reconcile herſelf to the unavoidable event.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="unknown:033748_0234_0FF935512BAA0250"/>This ſhe effected; and not long after, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained her in marriage, and triumphed in the ſucceſs of his duplicity.</p>
               <p>In proceſs of time, her other lover returned. Diſappointment and deſpair preſided in his breaſt. He ſaw Sylvia, upbraided her with her inconſtancy, and declared himſelf utterly ruined. Pity and returning love operated in her mind, and rendered her completely wretched. She moſt ſeverely condemned her own folly, in liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening to the dictates of a miſguided curioſity; and acknowledged herſelf juſtly puniſhed, for preſuming to pry into the ſecret deſigns of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſtrolling pretenders to foreknowledge are peculiarly dangerous to the weak-minded and credulous part of the community; and how it happens that they are ever encouraged, is to me inconceivable. Did they actually give the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation they promiſe, how much reaſon ſhould we have to avoid them! How many ſources of grief would be opened, by the anticipation of future evils, of which, now, we have no appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion! and how often ſhould we be deprived of the conſolatory hope of a ſpeedy deliverance from preſent ſufferings!</p>
               <p>With every ſentiment of reſpect and affection, I am moſt ſincerely your's.</p>

               <p>A MOST melancholy and diſtreſſing event has ſpread a gloom over the face of the metrop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olis. Every heart heaves the ſympathetic ſigh, and every eye drops the tear of regret. The very ſudden death of Doctor Clarke, who was ſeized with an apoplectic fit, in the midſt of his ſermon, yeſterday afternoon, and expired this morning, is a ſubject of univerſal lamentation.</p>
               <p>Not only we, who had the happineſs to ſit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his miniſtry, and to enjoy his particular friendſhip and attention, but the whole town; and, indeed, the public at large have ſuſtained a great loſs in his departure. Amiable in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, engaging in his manners, and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in his whole deportment, he conciliated the affections of every claſs. His talents as a ſcholar, philoſopher, and divine, commanded the reſpect of the moſt judicious and learned; while the elegance, perſpicuity and delicacy of his ſtyle, joined with the undiſſembled ſeriouſneſs of his manner, rendered him uniformly acceptable to the devout. In every condition and relation of life, he was exemplary as a Chriſtian; and as a preacher, an air of perſuaſion invariably accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him, which arreſted the attention of the moſt heedleſs auditors.</p>

               <p>A ſtriking example of this occurred ſome years ago, which I will take the liberty to relate. He preached in a neighbouring church on theſe words, "She that liveth in pleaſure is dead while ſhe liveth."<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Timothy, v.6.</note> In this diſcourſe he painted thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements of pleaſure which ſurround the young and gay; more eſpecially of our ſex, in the moſt juſt and lively colours. He repreſented, in pathetic, engaging and refined language, the ſnares to which they are expoſed, and the moſt probable means of eſcaping them. He exhibited, with all their attractions, the native charms of virtue, and pourtrayed vice in its true deformity. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, in the moſt animating terms, the reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability, uſefulneſs, and happineſs of thoſe who undeviatingly adhere to the path of rectitude

and innocence; and, with tbe moſt energetic and affectionate tenderneſs, warned the youth to avoid the devious walks of vice and diſſipation.</p>
               <p>A number of young ladies, who had been his hearers, happening to be together in the evening, united in the wiſh to expreſs their gratitude to him; but not having a perſonal acquaintance with him, could deviſe no better method than wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. The following anonymous letter was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly penned by one of the company, and private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conveyed to the Doctor, at the requeſt of all.</p>

                        <salute>REVEREND SIR,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>THE well known candour of your diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and your apparent zeal for the promotion of religion and virtue, embolden us to flatter ourſelves, that you will pardon this method of conveying to you our ſincere and united thanks for your very ſeaſonable, judicious, and uſeful diſcourſe, delivered laſt Sunday morning, at our meeting.</p>
                     <p>It is much to be lamented, that the depravity of the age is ſuch, as to render ſermons of this nature juſt and neceſſary; and it is almoſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of equal regret, that we have ſo ſeldom op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of being benefited by them.</p>
                     <p>That we oftener hear than receive inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is a truth which can neither be denied, nor evaded; and can only be accounted for, by that
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:033748_0238_0FF8C97946117B68"/>
paſſionate fondneſs for pleaſure, which prevails to ſuch a degree of enthuſiaſm, as to precipitate its votaries into whatever presents itſelf under this deluding aſpect, without conſidering whether it be durable, or fleeting.</p>
                     <p>It is certainly a moſt humiliating reflection, that our ſex (which is the female) ſhould ever take more pains to gain the qualifications of agreeable triflers than of rational friends; or be more anxious to become <hi>amuſing,</hi> than uſeful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. But, Sir, does not ſuch conduct in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies too often receive the moſt flattering en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement from the gentlemen? How ſeldom is intrinſic merit diſtinguiſhed; and the ſerious, prudent female preferred, even by thoſe who ſtyle themſelves men of ſenſe and penetration, to the airy flaunting coquette!</p>
                     <p>The conſtant attention which is paid to thoſe who make the gayeſt appearance, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe which is laviſhed upon her who has the largeſt portion of external graces and faſhionable embelliſhments, induce many who entertain the good-natured deſire of pleaſing, to beſtow more of their time and care on the cultivation of thoſe ſuperficial accompliſhments, which they find neceſſary to render them acceptable to moſt circles into which they fall, than upon the acquiſition of thoſe ſubſtantial virtues, which they daily ſee neglected and ridiculed; though, at the ſame time, perhaps, they are convinced of the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior ſatisfaction which the latter would afford.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="241" facs="unknown:033748_0239_0FF935F15B33C690"/>But it is needleſs for one ſex to criminate the other. We allow, that, generally ſpeaking, they are equally to blame. In this inſtance, however, as the male aſſume the prerogative of ſuperior judgment and intellectual abilities, they ought to prove the juſtice of their claim by ſetting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler examples, and by endeavouring to reform whatever tends to vitiate the taſte and corrupt the morals of ſociety.</p>
                     <p>Yet, after all, the evil cannot be effectually remedied, but by the concurrent exertions of both: and we are humbly of opinion, that if this refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation were more frequently inculcated from the pulpit, in the delicate, engaging, and pious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the diſcourſe which now excites our grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude to you, and our reſolutions to conduct ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, it would be efficacious in bringing about ſo deſirable an event.</p>
                     <p>We entreat your pardon, Reverend Sir, for the freedom, prolixity, and errors of this epiſtle.</p>
                     <p>Though perſonally unknown to you, we doubt not you will readily grant it, when we aſſure you, that we are actuated by a ſincere regard to the intereſts of religion and morality, and by a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſenſe of your exertions in the glorious cauſe.</p>

               <p>The univerſal approbation beſtowed upon thoſe, which he ſuffered to ſee the light, is an unequivocal evidence of his merit, as an author. His "Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to a Student in the Univerſity of Cambridge," are written in a moſt pleaſing ſtyle, and contain inſtruction and advice, of which no perſon in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of a public education ought to be ignorant. His "Anſwer to the queſtion, Why are you a Chriſtian?" which has already had three editions in Boſton, and three in England, is one of the beſt compendiums of the external and internal evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of our holy religion, extant. It is plain and intelligible to the loweſt capacity, and may enable every one without much ſtudy, to give a reaſon for the hope that is in him.</p>
               <p>From theſe ſpecimens we may form an opinion of what the world has loſt by his early exit.</p>
               <p>I ſhall make no other apology for the length of this letter, than the intereſt which I feel in the ſubject; and this, I am perſuaded, you will deem ſufficient.</p>

Unwilling, however, to be thought a ſimple country-girl, totally unacquainted with the world, I ſought no explanation from her; but repaired to a particular friend for inſtruction. From whom I learned that the chief value of theſe ſame memorandum-books conſiſts in their containing imported cuts of ladies' head-dreſſes, hats, and other habiliments, which are always ſure to be admired and imitated, as the perfection of taſte and propriety!</p>
               <p>This diſcovery mortified me exceedingly. It juſtified, beyond any thing which I had ever ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to exiſt as a fact, what I once heard a Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:033748_0245_0FF9367B289F5E48"/>
aſſert, "that Americans had neither char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter nor opinion of their own."</p>
               <p>With due deference to thoſe better judges, who deſpiſe the ſimplicity of our anceſtors, and labour to introduce the corrupt manners and cuſtoms of the old world into our country, I cannot but think it extremely ridiculous for an independent nation, which diſcards all foreign influence, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in its freedom, and boaſts of its genius and taſte, ſervilely to ape exotic faſhions, even in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of dreſs and fanciful ornaments.</p>
               <p>Have not the daughters of Columbia ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient powers of invention to decorate themſelves? Muſt we depend upon the winds and waves for the form, as well as the materials of our garb? Why may we not follow our own inclination; and not be deemed finical or prudiſh in our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, merely becauſe our habit is not exactly correſpondent with the pretty pictures in the memorandum-books, laſt imported?</p>
               <p>It is ſincerely to be regretted that this ſubject is viewed in ſo important a light. It occupies too much of the time, and engroſſes too much of the converſation of our ſex. For one, I have ſerious thoughts of declaring independence.</p>

               <head>To Miſs <hi>CAROLINE LITTLETON.</hi> [On the Death of her Mother.]</head>
               <opener>
                  <dateline>HARMONY-GROVE.</dateline>
                  <salute>MY DEAR CAROLINE,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>TO tell you that I am ſorry for your loſs, or that I ſympathize with you in your affliction, would be but the language you daily hear; and often, perhaps, from the unfeeling and indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. But you will do me the juſtice to believe, that I take a particular intereſt in your concerns, and really ſhare your grief. A holy Providence has wounded you by a ſtroke, which is extremely painful and ſevere. Your beſt friend is ſhrouded in the grave. In the maternal breaſt, your fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt affections, and moſt unſuſpecting confidence have hitherto concentred; and who can provide you with an equivalent ſubſtitute? To the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Father and Friend of creation, it becomes you to repair for comfort and ſupport.</p>
               <p>The dying advice and counſel of your dear mamma, which, you inform me, were pathetic, inſtructive and conſolatory, will be a guide to your feet. Often realize the ſolemn ſcene, and remember, that, "though dead, ſhe yet ſpeaketh."</p>
               <p>You have great cauſe of thankfulneſs, that ſhe was ſpared to direct you ſo far through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate and dangerous path of youth; to complete
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:033748_0247_0FF936A3A2606270"/>
your education; to teach you, by her example, how to acquit yourſelf with uſefulneſs and honor; and, above all, to furniſh you with that important knowledge, to which every thing elſe ſhould be made ſubſervient—how to die!</p>
               <p>An era of your life has now commenced, which is no leſs important than affecting. That aſſiſting hand, which formerly led you, is now cold and lifeleſs! Thoſe lips, from which you have been accuſtomed to receive information and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, are ſealed in perpetual, ſilence! And that heart, which always glowed with the warmeſt ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude for your happineſs, has ceaſed to palpitate!</p>
               <p>You muſt now think and act for yourſelf. As the eldeſt daughter, you will be placed at the head of your father's family. You muſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, adopt a plan of conduct, conducive to its harmony, regularity, and intereſt.</p>
               <p>Filial duty to your ſurviving parent, more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly inculcated by your participation of his heavy bereavement, will lead you to conſult his inclination, and ſedulouſly contribute all in your power to lighten the burden of domeſtic arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments devolved upon him. While he laments the death of a prudent, affectionate, and beloved wife, give him reaſon to rejoice, that he is bleſſed with a daughter, capable of ſoothing the pains, alleviating the cares, and heightening the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his life.</p>
               <p>Your brothers and ſiſters will look up to you as the guide of their tender years. While their
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:033748_0248_0FF936C058E0AAE8"/>
weeping eyes and pathetic accents are directed towards you, let kindneſs, diſcretion, and patience, characterize your deportment, and engage their confidence and love.</p>
               <p>Having mentioned your duty to others, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſmiſs the ſubject without dropping a few hints for your direction, in regard to your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal behaviour.</p>
               <p>A very important charge is committed to you, as well in the duties which you owe to yourſelf, as in the ſuperintendence of your father's family.</p>
               <p>The ſovereign Diſpoſer of all things has, at an early age, made you, in a meaſure, your own guardian. Your father's buſineſs calls him much abroad. With you, therefore, he is obliged to entruſt, not only his domeſtic concerns; but, what is ſtill more dear to his heart, the care of your own perſon and mind; of your own reputation and happineſs.</p>
               <p>Circumſtanced as you are, company has the moſt powerful charms. Your's is now the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of receiving and returning viſits in your own name. At home, you are ſole miſtreſs of ceremonies. This is extremely alluring to the ſprightly fancy of youth. But time, you will remember, is too important a bleſſing to be ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rificed to a promiſcuous crowd of unimproving companions. Beſides, the character of a young lady will neceſſarily be ſullied by the imputation of being conſtantly engaged in parties of pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure,
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:033748_0249_0FF936C48F4CD6F0"/>
and exhilarating amuſement. Flattery often avails itſelf of the unguarded moments of gaiety; and, inſinuating its inſidious charms into the heedleſs and ſuſceptible mind, inflates it with pride and vanity, and produces an affectation and air of ſelf-importance, which are peculiarly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſting, becauſe eaſily diſtinguiſhed from that true dignity of manners, which reſults from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious rectitude. Genuine merit is always modeſt and unaſſuming; diſſident of itſelf, and reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to others.</p>
               <p>Your father has a right to your unlimited con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. You will, therefore, make him your chief friend and counſellor. Though he may not poſſeſs all the winning ſoftneſs of a mother, he doubtleſs has as ardent an affection for you, and as ſincere a deſire to promote your welfare. Hence you may ſafely repoſe your deareſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns in his paternal breaſt, and receive, with the utmoſt deference, his kind inſtruction and advice. Let his judgment have an entire aſcendency over your mind and actions, eſpecially in your inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and ſociety with the other ſex. Conſider him as better acquainted with their merit, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and views, than you can be; and, ſhould you contemplate a connexion for life, let his opinion determine your choice.</p>
               <p>Watch over your dear little ſiſters, with all the tenderneſs of fraternal affection; be their protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and friend; inſtil into their minds the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:033748_0250_0FF936E32C182988"/>
of virtue and religion; arm them againſt the ſnares and temptations by which they will be ſurrounded; and lead them, by your own conduct, in the way of truth and peace.</p>
               <p>When you have leiſure and inclination to write, the effuſions of your pen will always be acceptable to your ſincere and faithful friend,</p>
