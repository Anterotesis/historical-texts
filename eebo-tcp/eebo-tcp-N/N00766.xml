            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>When You were a few years ago, becoming like the Primitive Believers for Your <hi>One Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,</hi> and Embracing each other, with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Name of, UNITED BRETHREN; the <hi>Tidings were as cold waters to our thirſty Souls,</hi> in this far Countrey, and the <hi>Tidings</hi> were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamed, and Received with <hi>Joy,</hi> throughout the Churches, in theſe <hi>American</hi> Colonies. But I will take the Leave to Tranſcribe and Report unto you, ſome words, of the Diſcourſe here publiſhed Eight years ago, on that memorable Occaſion.
<q>
                  <hi>Satan</hi> will doubtleſs endeavour to undermine this UNION: A certain King of <hi>England,</hi> holding a Treaty of Peace, with a <hi>French</hi> King, in an old Chappel that lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their two Armies, both came to a good Agreement; but as they were coming out of the Chappel, a <hi>Snake</hi> ſuddenly crept out of the old Wall, which they ſeeing, Drew their Swords, and their Servants at the Door Drew likewiſe: Upon this, the whole Armies no leſs furiouſly than ignorantly advanced upon one another, and Commenced a Battel, wherein a moſt horrid Slaughter was made, before the miſtake was Rectified. Alas, it often thus comes to paſs;<note place="margin">[<hi>Bleſsed <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nions page</hi> 85, 86. <hi>Printed</hi> 1692.</note> when the Servants of God have been juſt Finiſhing a <hi>Reconciliation</hi> the <hi>Old Serpent</hi> will interpoſe, &amp; interrupt it all.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Your Friends on this Side of the <hi>Atlantick,</hi> are with <hi>Grief</hi> making <hi>Jobs</hi> Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>The thing which I greatly Feared is come!</hi>

With a very condolent <hi>Sympathy,</hi> we feel the Blowes, which the Two <hi>Sticks,</hi> that we thought <hi>made One,</hi> are giving to one another.

It is the <hi>Criſis,</hi> the chief indication of the Churches ſtate, which will <hi>Stand</hi> or <hi>Fall</hi> with <hi>this Truth.</hi> The Churches in <hi>Galatia</hi> Embraced <hi>another Goſpel,</hi> when they let go this principle, <hi>That we are Juſtified by the alone Righteouſneſs of Chriſt apprehended by Faith.</hi> The parting with <hi>this Truth</hi> has alſo proved fatal to the <hi>Romiſh Synagogue</hi>: Without doubt <hi>Paul</hi> was acted by a <hi>Prophetick Spirit,</hi> when in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> he did ſo largely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt on this Subject.</p>
            <p>We eſteem the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches to be in ſeveral points <hi>Heterodox:</hi> And in ſome things (eſpecially in the Doctrine of <hi>Free-Will</hi>) in which <hi>Luther</hi> himſelf (who was a great Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion) did ſtrenuouſly aſſert the Truth, they have deſerted him.

            <p>THE <hi>Juſtification of a Sinner,</hi> in the Sight of God, being a matter of greateſt Importance, and Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Souls of men; it hath been the Practice of the Miniſters of <hi>New-England,</hi> (according to my Obſervation) from the Beginning, frequently to acquaint their People with, or to inſiſt upon the true Doctrine of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> according to the word of GOD; and the <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of our Faith, and concurrence of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Divines and Churches in other parts of the World: and for divers of the moſt Eminent of the firſt Miniſters to leave upon record the ſame Doctrine in their Printed works for the benefit of Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; Such as Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Hooker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Richard Mather,</hi> Mr. <hi>Chaney,</hi> Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> and Mr. <hi>Norton</hi>: in which Practiſe they have been followed by the Miniſter who have ſucceeded them: As there was a very uſeful Diſcourſe of Mr. <hi>Willard</hi> on Juſtification, Publiſhed ſome few years ago; So here is now preſented to the Readers view, another little Treatiſe on the ſame Subject<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> containing <hi>no other Doctrine of Justification, then
<pb facs="unknown:000923_0021_0FACA326F1FDF940"/>
what hath been Preached and Received in</hi> New-England <hi>from the beginning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true indeed that in our firſt times and for ſome few years, the <hi>Peace</hi> of theſe Churches was diſturbed by a Company of real <hi>Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who zealouſly crying up the <hi>free Grace</hi> of God, and the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of Chriſt for <hi>Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>; but groſsly neglecting, ſlighting and vilifying the Graces and Duties of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> they made their folly appear unto all men, and their Religion quickly came to an end. For by their general removal out of this Colony to <hi>Road-Iſland</hi> (a place where they might every one <hi>do what was right in their own eyes</hi>) they ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves to be meer <hi>Libertines,</hi> and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right <hi>Worldlings:</hi> contenting themſelves with the accommodations of a fruitful Iſland, they caſt off the very <hi>Form of Religion</hi>; they and their Poſterity (for the generality of them) living about theſe threeſcore years paſt, without any <hi>Churches, Miniſters, Ordinances,</hi> or keeping of the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> only profeſſing <hi>Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> at large, that men might there be of <hi>any Religion</hi> or <hi>no Religion,</hi> as they would them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: this is notoriouſly known to all <hi>New-England.</hi> So dreadfully dangerous it is to <hi>turn the Grace of God into Wantonneſs,</hi> and to pervert the Doctrine of <hi>Juſtification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After that Storm was over, and ever ſince (in my Obſervation) the Miniſters and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>New-England</hi> have retained and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="unknown:000923_0022_0FACA327A89E3D38"/>
the true Doctrine of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> with an equal care of the true Doctrine &amp; Practice of <hi>Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to be forever joyned with it; profeſſing alſo and proclaiming to all men, that we take the <hi>Law</hi> of God in his <hi>Ten Commandments</hi> to be the <hi>Rule of Life</hi>; and yet ſo, as to Fence againſt the other Extream of Eſtabliſhing any <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of our own,</hi> which is equally dangerous to the Souls of men, and which we all naturally and habitually are enclined to, ſeeking to be Juſtified, either by works without Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſt, or ſome way or other joyning them with Chriſt. Hence they have conſtantly affirmed &amp; maintained, that the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of Chriſt alone, (<hi>viz.</hi> Chriſts O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the <hi>Law</hi> in <hi>our Stead</hi>) is the only <hi>Material</hi> and <hi>Meritorious</hi> cauſe, and Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Imputation</hi> thereof unto Believers, is the only formal cauſe of our <hi>Juſtification</hi>; whence it is that our Sins are pardoned, and perſons are accepted as righteous unto Eternal Life.</p>
            <p>As for the Reverend and Worthy <hi>Author</hi> of this enſuing work; after he had publiſhed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fruitful Treatiſes on other Subj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>'Tis true; We ſometimes read, <hi>That Faith is Imputed for,</hi> [or, To] <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi> 'Tis not unlikely that one Thing intended in it, may be This; That though <hi>Faith</hi> be the <hi>Gift</hi> of God unto us, yet God <hi>Reckons</hi> this <hi>Faith</hi> our <hi>own</hi>; for except the <hi>Faith</hi> be <hi>Reckoned</hi> our <hi>own,</hi> how ſhould it be ſubſervient at all, to bring unto us the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.

There is nothing more uſual, than to ſpeak that of the <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> which is meant of the <hi>Object,</hi> that is by that <hi>Instrument</hi> applied unto. Doth any man Scruple to ſay, <hi>The Hand feeds the Body</hi>? why ſo? Becauſe the <hi>Hand</hi> is that which takes the <hi>Meat,</hi> that <hi>Feeds</hi> the <hi>Body.

               </p>
               <p>Now, as the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> is <hi>Ordered in all things,</hi> there is an <hi>Order</hi> of things here fixed by God. If we are <hi>Juſtified by Faith,</hi> ſure we are not Juſtified <hi>Before</hi> it, or, <hi>Without</hi> it. There is this <hi>Orderly Connexion,</hi> in the <hi>Golden Chain of Salvation.</hi> Rom. 8.30.

While a man is an <hi>
