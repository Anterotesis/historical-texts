            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>in Holineſs, fearful in Praiſes, doing Wonders,</hi> has lately manifeſted his Power and ſtretched-out Arm, in Defence of this Nation; his Munificence has ſhowered down upon us all the Bleſſings of Peace, whilſt his Juſtice makes other Nations feel all the Calamities of War; he has crowned our Arms with ſignal Succeſſes both by Sea and Land; the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:008702_0005_102FBA259D77CAF0"/>Haughtineſs of our inveterate Foes has been co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by him with Shame and Confuſion; and if, regardleſs of his Chaſtiſements, they perſiſt in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Deſigns, in perfidious Dealings, in violent Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, he will ſurely level all their aſpiring Thoughts with the Duſt, and cruſh into Abortion their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive Machinations.</p>
            <p>WE have always, and now more eſpecially, juſt Reaſon to let Praiſes and Thankſgivings dwell on our Lips, and in our Minds, for the ſingular Mercies it has pleaſed God to ſhew us. Let us therefore raiſe the Voice of Exultation, let us ſound the Trumpet of Praiſe, let us pay the Tribute of Thanks to the Moſt High. This our Felicity, next to, and under the Direction of his all-gracious providential Care, we are indebted for to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's wiſe Councils, which the Event has proved to have been planned with a judicious Forecaſt, and executed with a no leſs noble than vigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Spirit. It was theſe wiſe Councils that made Choice of General JAMES WOLFE for the Conqueſt of <hi>Quebec,</hi> the Capital of the <hi>French</hi> Empire in <hi>North-America.</hi> He did not heſitate to obey his Orders, or cavil with his Inſtructions; his Country called him forth; he went, fought the Enemy, and died crowned with Victory.</p>
            <p>HERE, what a Scene, mingled with Glory and Pity, Joy and Sorrow, Triumph and Mourning, preſents itſelf to View!</p>
            <p>How glorious was it for a ſmall Body of Troops, amidſt a Multiplicity of Obſtacles, almoſt unſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountable, to defeat ſo numerous an Enemy; and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:008702_0006_102FBA27278DC738"/>yet we pity that Bravery, that Ardour, that Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to Honour, that Senſe of Duty, that Love of the Country in the noble Commander; becauſe, as the moving Spring to animate others with Motion, as the powerful Example begun and ſhewn in himſelf to lead on to Conqueſt, he was thereby prompted to hazard and loſe a Life ſo precious to his Country!</p>
            <p>HARK! what Shouts of Joy rend the Sky whilſt <hi>Britons</hi> cry VICTORY! The neighbouring Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ſend back the Sound! <hi>Quebec</hi> hears it, chilled with Horrors; the <hi>Indian</hi> Nations ſtand aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But alas! this Joy, ſo full of Confuſion for the Enemy; ſo ſweet a Source of Pleaſure for <hi>Britons,</hi> is ſoon marred with Bitterneſs. <hi>Britons</hi> ſee, with Sorrow painted on their down-caſt Faces, their General breathing his laſt; they count over, with Regret, his honourable Wounds; and while they bathe them with their Tears, they cannot help thinking, that, that Victory muſt be ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which required for its Purchaſe the Blood of ſo great and ſo good a General.</p>
            <p>Lo! Triumphs were not wanting, to declare the Importance of our Conqueſt. They were not, indeed, thoſe Triumphs that dazzle the Sight, by the Splendor of an external ſolemn Pomp; but they were Triumphs in the Heart of every true <hi>Briton,</hi> and every ſincere Wiſher to the Welfare of his Country. Our <hi>North-American</hi> Colonies had long experienced all the Inconveniences of a more than troubleſome Neighbourhood; they were delivered up, by an encroaching and rapacious Enemy, to the Incurſions and Depredations of the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:008702_0007_102FBA2E77584A08"/>moſt barbarous Savages: Let us draw a Veil over the Treatment they received, over the uncommon Cruelties exerciſed upon them; Humanity cannot ſtand the Shock of a bare Repreſentation! What muſt be their Thoughts when the welcome News came to them of the Conqueſt of <hi>Quebec?</hi> All their Fears were diſſipated; the certain Hopes of future Peace and Security ſmiled upon them; every Breaſt glowed with Triumph. <hi>Britain,</hi> a fond Parent, felt the warm Emotions of the dear Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhe had nurtured and educated with ſo much Care. How deeply was ſhe, ſome Time ago, afflicted to learn their Diſtreſs? She rode on the rapid Wings of Tenderneſs to their Relief; her potent Arm raiſed them up; it bade them follow to the Revenge of Battle; and now ſhe exults with them in Triumph. O great and glorious Triumph, how magnificent wouldſt thou have been, were the Triumphs of mortal Man, pure, unſullied, and unmixed! Thy Brightneſs is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured, thy Beauties fade, they Gaiety grows ſullen, when the Reflection ſtarts upon us, diſmal and doleful Reflection! proclaiming aloud, that WOLFE is dead; WOLFE! that valiant Captain, whoſe auſpicious Conduct is the Cauſe of all our Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph. Then, O then, the Eye is ſeen to mourn; the Countenance in vain recals its Sprightlineſs; nay, the whole Body, to ſhew it ſympathizes with the ſincere Regret of the Mind, would willingly clothe itſelf with a Garb expreſſive of Sorrow!</p>
            <p>BUT ceaſe, ye unavailing Tears! Ceaſe to flow! Ye flow without Reaſon! WOLFE is not dead. He now enjoys a Life of Immortality. His Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory will be for ever dear to <hi>Britons.</hi> Heaven,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008702_0008_102FBA3006146580"/>ſumming up his heroic Virtues, judged them to be ripe for the Fruition of eternal Happineſs. Yes, O Divine Being, Author of all good Gifts! <hi>He</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Pſal. xxi. ver. 4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>aſked Life of thee, and thou gaveſt it him, even Length of Days for ever and ever: His Glory is great in thy Salvation, Honour and Majeſty haſt thou laid upon him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SUCH are the ineffable Rewards that await Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; ſuch General JAMES WOLFE is now in the quiet and undiſturbed Poſſeſſion of; he now ſits exalted above the Reach of impotent Envy, which cannot detract from his Merit; and this his Merit will appear in the moſt conſpicuous and amiable Light, after paſſing in Review the principal Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Life.</p>
            <p>JAMES WOLFE has a juſt Claim to very honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Progenitors. He was the Son of Colonel EDWARD WOLFE, and was born at <hi>Weſterham,</hi> in the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> where he was baptiſed <hi>January</hi> the 11th, 1726. It is ſaid of him, that, even in his earlieſt Youth, he had by Words and Actions exhibited ſeveral Specimens of what he was one Day likely to be: So true it is, that the natural Diſpoſition will work its Way, and ſhew itſelf in the Diſplay of ingenious Contrivances, when the Application of Art and Precepts, where it is wanting, will have little or no Effect. His illuſtrious Parents, who could eaſily diſcern in him the Dawn of great Hopes, were aſſiduous to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it into the Maturity of ſtrong, bright, and vivid Rays. Every Thing in young WOLFE con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to ſecond their Intentions; he not only
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:008702_0009_102FBA338EB2FC38"/>performed whatever he was enjoined with all the Alacrity of Inclination, but even his Performance was admirable; and the more ſo, as it far exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Years. Happy Genius! deſtined by ſuch evident Marks to be the Support and Ornament of your Country.</p>
            <p>THESE were only the Rudiments and Eſſays of tender Childhood: The Flower was ſtill in the Bud; it only gliſtened bedecked with the Pearls of Morning Dew. But, when once its native ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Warmth began to tranſmit the generous Sap, it opened, it blowed, into all the Charms of Adoleſcency. Now we behold young WOLFE, not inſenſibly, but, by a briſk and lively Progreſs, learning and practiſing all the Duties, and all the Virtues, that ſpread their Luſtre on a well-inſtituted Life. His Apprehenſion was exceeding quick and clear, penetrating almoſt in a Moment into the deepeſt Receſſes of whatever was neceſſary for him to know: His Judgment, acute and ſolid, readily determined him in the Choice of what was beſt; and his Memory, eaſy and retentive, laid up for his Uſe, as in a faithful Repoſitory, all his precious Acquiſitions. Society, as in a Mirrour, could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template in him all the Perfections that tend to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance its Benefit. His Friendſhips were the more ſincere and conſtant, as being cemented on the Groundwork of Reaſon; yet not ſo reſtrained to the Sweets of particular Attachments, as ever to exclude a more extenſive Spirit of Benevolence, which glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him, to promote the univerſal Good of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Hence he was polite, affable, gentle, free, and unreſerved in his Converſation; no ſtiff, ſullen, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding, haughty, boiſterous Airs ruffled the Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:008702_0010_102FBA3513C20B60"/>of his Countenance; and, as his Graces were truly engaging, actuated by Honour, replete with Candour, devoid of Affectation, ſo none ever refuſed him the kindeſt Wiſhes of their Hearts.</p>
            <p>BESIDES theſe ſocial Virtues, and many others which might be enumerated, he poſſeſſed, even in thoſe Years, that Purity and Integrity of Mind, which made him on all Occaſions adhere ſtrictly to the Dictates of Juſtice, and withal inſpired him with ſuch a deep Senſe of Religion, that the good Chriſtian did not ſeem ſo much added to, as to crown and complete the Uniformity of his Conduct. And, indeed, it was this Senſe of Religion that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted Spirit and Motion; nay, I may ſay, covered with the Shield of Intrepidity, and fitted the Wings of Impetuoſity to, the Courage which afterwards appeared in his military Character. He was tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly convinced within himſelf, that he who is regardleſs of his Duty to God, will be but a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Obſerver of his Duty to his Country and Prince. The Officer whoſe Vigour of Mind and Body is emaſculated by Voluptuouſneſs, whoſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites reliſh nothing but Immoralities, cannot look at an Enemy in the Face: He either flies, betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the daſtardly Spirit of a Coward; or, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed by all the Horrors of conſcious Guilt, kneels, deprecating the Vengeance of the uplift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Arm ready to ſtrike the fatal Blow: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Chriſtian Soldier, who complies with his Duty, not by Neceſſity, but by Choice; not through the ſervile Fear of Reproach, but for the Welfare and Glory of his Country, is not abaſhed to meet his Foe; he is ſeized with no Horrors of Conſcience to make him grovel in Timidity; his Mind is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:008702_0011_102FBA3697E87008"/>ſteady, and active; no Difficulties can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct his victorious Sword, nor no Dangers deter him from executing the Purpoſe of his Soul.</p>
            <p>ALL the Actions of WOLFE expreſſed this Pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait of the Chriſtian Soldier, from the very Time he embraced the Profeſſion of Arms, which was ſo early as when he was but juſt able to bear them. Eager to receive Inſtruction, punctual to obey Command, aſſiduous to form himſelf and others to all the Exactneſs of military Diſcipline, he ſoon merited the Eſteem of his Equals, and was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with the Commendations of his Superiors. How wonderfully does Praiſe operate on an ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous Mind! It is its Sting, its Spur, its Fire; it rouſes, it puſhes on, it inflames the whole Man to atchieve the moſt gallant Exploits: Yet WOLFE, though ſenſible of it, was far from being puffed up with vain Pride: Praiſe may flatter others with the Thoughts of Self-ſufficiency, with an over Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in their Abilities; but in him its Effects were only predominant to the Out-doing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in ſtill greater and more ſpirited Acts.</p>
            <p>DURING the laſt War he was preſent at almoſt every Engagement, in which he bore no inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Part, ſignaliſing his Courage by vigorous Attacks upon the Enemy, and frequently his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, in a very maſterly Manner, amidſt Dangers and Difficulties. No Wonder, then, if his military Genius was ſingled out, as one that promiſed to appear eminently diſtinguiſhed in the firſt Rank. But, whilſt it was thus riſing apace, admired and applauded by all, Peace lulled to Reſt the Horrors of War, and cut ſhort his fond Hopes of gathering freſh Laurels.</p>
            <p>

IT happens but too often, upon the Declaration of a Peace, that both the Officer and Soldier, to wear down the diſagreeable Impreſſion of the many Fatigues and Hardſhips they underwent in the Service of the War, greedily catch at the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement of every Relaxation, or rather the Bait of every Pleaſure that preſents itſelf. This In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment, ſo ſweet and raviſhing in the Taſte it affords, is fraught with a ſure though ſlow Poiſon. The Deſires are ſtimulated to a further Indulgence, and at length Habit ſo rivets the Chains of ſoft Dalliance, that the martial Hero, encompaſſed by them, is ſurprized, when called upon to exert his former Valour, that he cannot poſſibly find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Not ſo with WOLFE. Recreation and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure never ſo prevailed over him as to make him forget what he owed to himſelf and to his Country. All the Nerves of his warlike Diſpoſition were kept firmly braced; and, ſtudious to improve the important Leſſons he had already learned into a laſting Advantage, he wiſely made the Eaſe and Leiſure of Peace inſtrumental to the cultivating of the Arts of War.</p>
            <p>AND who but he could ſo properly make War his Study? Who but he diſcovered the mighty Genius for it? The more we take a View of this Genius, the more we ſhall be enamoured of it: No Quality was wanting to it, which ſeemed requiſite to form and magnify the Hero. Ancient and modern Diſcipline were equally known to him: He united the moſt ſhining Talents of the beſt Maſters in the Science of War in his own Perſon; fully perſuaded, that it is not Speculation, which may be vain and idle, but Contrivance, Induſtry, and Application that complete the Warrior.</p>

OF this I call you to be the Witneſſes, ye ſix Battalions, that fought ſo gloriouſly in the Plains of <hi>Minden!</hi> All the <hi>French</hi> Cavalry felt your Shock, ſtriking down and ravaging like a Thunder-bolt. It was not a wild Force, ruſhing forth with preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate Raſhneſs, and often ſpending itſelf in the Impetuoſity of its Efforts, that broke and routed the Enemy's Squadrons; it was the Regularity and Exactneſs of Diſcipline WOLFE himſelf infuſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one of theſe Battalions, when he governed it as Lieutenant-Colonel. By the Inſtinct of his Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city it leads the Way in that Field of Fame; the reſt ſpeed after the great Example: Inclination calls them to it, and Death is dealt from every Blow of the invincible Legion!</p>
            <p>THIS is thy Victory, here are thy Trophies, O WOLFE! I ſay again it was the Inſtinct of thy Capacity that conquered in the Plains of <hi>Minden:</hi> Thy Spirit, thy Elevation, Preſence of Mind, and Judgment were preſent at the Battle: They guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Work thy Hands had faſhioned; and this Work overthrew the Enemy, with great Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. All <hi>Europe</hi> heard of it and was amazed! <hi>Britain</hi> knew thee, her Son, to be the Author of it, and therefore ſhe now records the Glory of this Day in her Annals to thy immortal Honour!</p>
            <p>WHEN, at the Breaking-out of the preſent War, the great Miniſter, who now ſits at the Helm of Affairs, was making ſtrenuous Efforts to cut off the Hydra-Head of Faction, and to awake the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Spirit from the ungrateful Slumbers it was laid in, WOLFE, freſh with manly Life, appeared upon the Stage of Action, to put in Practice, for
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:008702_0014_102FBA4535B41BA0"/>his Country's Service, the profound Study we have ſeen him make in Peace of the Arts of War. The Miniſter's diſcerning Eye pointed him out to be a powerful Aid to thoſe, who, in Right of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niority, claimed the Command, for executing his Deſigns againſt <hi>Rochfort;</hi> though the ill Succeſs of that Affair gave us afterwards Reaſon to wiſh the Claim had been founded on the Right of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputed Merit, influenced and biaſſed by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned Love of the Country. However pure and upright the Patriot Miniſter's Intentions were, it may be ſaid, that, his Adminiſtration being then in its Infancy, and not ſo thoroughly eſtabliſhed, Feuds, Animoſities, and Jealouſies had not yet ſubſided; and that there remained a Deal of the old Leaven, to corrupt the Maſs of the new, yet true Syſtem of Policy, if it was not purged off by due Circumſpection. Time alone, and a true Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate of our real Intereſt, can produce theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable Effects; and it is therefore we ſhall leave the well-projected Attack of <hi>Rochfort</hi> in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity it has been involved in, obſerving only, to the
<note n="†" place="bottom">What is here aſſerted may be ſeen authenticated by our beſt Accounts.</note> Honour of our young Hero, who was Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Maſter-General upon this Expedition, that he, with other Officers, whilſt our Fleet remained in the Bay of <hi>Baſque,</hi> the Weather being at the ſame Time very favourable for a Deſcent, went on Shore one Night, and walked two Miles up the Country without Interruption. Every Part of the Beach was found by him and his Company to be firm and dry; no Encampment, no Troops, no Batteries upon it. All, upon their Return to the Fleet, preſſed the landing of the Troops with great
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:008702_0015_102FBA4CF93D6588"/>Warmth; and, to the very laſt, there did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be any great Body of Men near the Shore, though ſomething looked like an Encampment.</p>
            <p>As it was practicable to land; as no ſufficient Body of the Enemy's Troops or Batteries were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to prevent it; as there was no Difference in the Situation of <hi>Rochfort,</hi> contrary to the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence given at Court; the Failure of the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſeemed to be chiefly grounded on not taking or attacking Fort <hi>Fouras.</hi> This was certified by the brave WOLFE; who took the Liberty, as he ſays himſelf, of ſuggeſting his Opinion to Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Hawke,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Mordaunt,</hi> That he did not doubt but a Ship of War might batter Fort <hi>Fouras,</hi> and that a Body of Troops might be land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the ſame Time, and attack it with Succeſs: He took the Liberty alſo to mention, as he only had ſeen the Fort, that, if Sir <hi>Edward Hawke</hi> thought proper to make a Diverſion near <hi>Rochelle</hi> at the ſame Time, it might engage the Attention of the <hi>French,</hi> and give an Opportunity of making a Deſcent between: He further hinted his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as to ſending the Bomb-Ketches out, not knowing but Bombs might be thrown into <hi>Rochelle;</hi> and he mentioned another Circumſtance, in regard to ſending for the Pilot of the <hi>Magnanime,</hi> who would inform Sir <hi>Edward</hi> if there was Depth of Water ſufficient to carry a Ship up to <hi>Fouras;</hi> adding, from the indifferent Opinion he had of the Fort, a forty or fifty Gun Ship might at leaſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy the Fort, ſo as to give an Opportunity of landing.</p>
            <p>HERE were Diſpoſitions worthy the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced General; Diſpoſitions which in all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>would
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:008702_0016_102FBA50A31D6910"/>have been attended with Succeſs in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, if they had been hearkened unto with a real Intention of doing effectual Service. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Heart of WOLFE could not help teſtifying its Regret for ſuch a Stagnation in Reſolution, which appeared but too ſenſibly: And, as he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely wiſhed well to his Country, what indignant Emotions muſt have filled his Breaſt, to ſee an expenſive and formidable Armament ſerve only the Purpoſes of a vain Parade!

            </p>
            <p>ON
<note n="§" place="bottom">See the <hi>London Gazette</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 18, 1758.</note> the 2d of <hi>June,</hi> 1758, when our Fleet, with about a Third of their Complement of Troops, anchored in <hi>Gabarus</hi> Bay, the gallant WOLFE, then a Brigadier-General, in Conjunction with General <hi>Amherſt,</hi> the Commander in Chief, and Brigadier-General <hi>Lawrence,</hi> reconnoitred the Shore as near as they could; and made a Diſpoſition for landing in three Places the next Morning, in Caſe the reſt of the Troops arrived. The Weather continuing very bad, and the Swell of the Sea high, the Landing could not poſſibly take Place till the 8th; at which Time Brigadier-General WOLFE was the firſt that rowed into the Shore with his Detachment. The Enemy did not throw away a Shot, till his Boats were near in Shore,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:008702_0017_102FBA545FF65B98"/>and then directed the whole Fire of their Cannon and Muſquetry upon them. Notwithſtanding their Fire, and the Violence of the Surf, which made it almoſt impracticable to find a Place for getting a Boat on Shore, Brigadier WOLFE purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Point; and, landing juſt at the Left of the Cove, took Poſt, attacked the Enemy, and forced them to retreat. Several Boats overſet, ſeveral were ſhattered to Pieces, and all the Men jumped into the Water, to follow their intrepid Leader.</p>
            <p>MANY were the Services whereby he afterwards ſignaliſed himſelf during this Siege; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, when, on Intelligence received that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had deſtroyed the grand Battery, and called in their Out-poſts, he was detached with 1200 Men, four Companies of Grenadiers, three Companies of Rangers, and ſome light Infantry, round the north-eaſt Harbour to the Light-Houſe Point, to ſilence the Iſland Battery, and at the ſame Time to attempt to deſtroy the Ships in the Harbour. He took Poſſeſſion of the Light-Houſe Point, with all the Poſts on that Side the Harbour, which the Enemy had abandoned, with ſeveral Cannon; and, when a large Party of them had crept out one Morning, to get ſome old Paliſades and Wood, he puſhed them in with a briſk Fire; and, taking Poſts on the Hills, from whence it was intended to try to demoliſh the Shipping, he marched forward on the Right, and forced the Enemy back to <hi>Cape Noire,</hi> with a ſmart Fire. After this, a great Cannonading continuing from the Town and Shipping on our Batteries, he was making an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced Work on the Right, thrown up at 650
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:008702_0018_102FBA579F57F8B8"/>Yards from the Covered-Way, with an Intention of erecting a Battery to deſtroy the Defences of the Place. The next Thing he did, was to puſh on a Corps, and take Poſſeſſion of the Hills in the Front of the Baraſoy, where he made a Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And, laſtly, a few Days before the Town capitulated, his Batteries contributed greatly to burn three of the Enemy's Ships. In ſhort, it is incredible what extraordinary Feats he performed in this Siege; and all of them the genuine Effects of his diſtinguiſhed Abilities, his Conduct and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepidity; which rendered him a Terror to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, and not without juſt Reaſon the Safeguard and Ornament of his Country.</p>
            <p>ON his Return home, what Encomiums were paſſed upon him by all Degrees of Men! But he, modeſt and diſcreet, aſcribed all the Glory to the prudent Management of him under whom he fought. It was a ſufficient Satisfaction to himſelf that his Country had been faithfully ſerved, and that he had done what he thought only his Duty. Unparalleled Moderation in the Manner of accepting the Tribute of Praiſe! Yet it is by theſe and the like humble Sentiments that exalted Merit appears in the Bloom of never-fading Beauty. Pride, and Arrogance, and Self-conceit will make but a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Figure; and, notwithſtanding all En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to impoſe by a glaring Outſide, cannot help ſhewing the ridiculous Deformity.</p>
            <p>WOLFE then deſerved, as the Reſtorer of the Reputation of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Arms; as the Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of <hi>Cape Breton</hi> with the noble <hi>Amherſt;</hi> to ride with him in the triumphal Car of Fame.
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:008702_0019_102FBA592363EBD8"/>
               <hi>Amherſt</hi> does not refuſe to acknowledge him the Partner of his Glory: Even without Jealouſy he felicitates him that others think as well of him as of himſelf; and, to declare how eminently he ſtands in his Eſteem, he generouſly recommends him to his Country, as worthy of the higheſt military Command. This Recommendation, tho' powerful, and highly valued by the grateful WOLFE, did not however carry that Force and Energy with it as his own Actions. They ſpoke aloud what he was and what he would be; and, though ſilent himſelf, uninfluenced by Ambition, which he was never known to court through the Mediation of the Great; intirely paſſive in the Diſpoſal that might be made of his Abilities, he was called upon, as the uſeful Man in the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of the State, to command the important Expedition againſt <hi>Quebec.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THERE is ſomething ſecret in Nature, not to be defined or expreſſed by Words, which, on conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering certain Objects, rouſes the Paſſions from the Indolency of Indifference, to make them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibe the Delicacies of Refinement, and elates the Soul with a full Proſpect of Grandeur, Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, Excellence, and Delight. Such is the Coſideration of WOLFE's Spirit in the conducting of this Enterpriſe; it is an Object that quickens the dull Lethargy of the Paſſions into the livelieſt Tranſports; we cannot withold our Admiration of it; the Soul ſometimes quietly and joyfully reſts in its Contemplation; ſometimes ſhe is winged into Extaſies; for ſhe finds in it both Grandeur and Delight: Not Grandeur and Delight contracted within a narrow Compaſs, as in a
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:008702_0020_102FBA5F9540CFA8"/>Meadow variegated with Flowers, and receiving an additional Beauty from a purling Brook, taught to water the tender Graſs; but Grandeur and Delight, vaſt and extenſive, as in the unbounded Proſpect of Hills and Vales, inumbrated with tall Cedars, and watered by an expanded River.</p>
            <p>FEW or none ever before roſe to WOLFE's great Reputation in War, till they had firſt obtained and firmly eſtabliſhed it by repeated Victories and Commands. He, in ſome Meaſure, as an unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedented Example, building upon the Foundation of ſcarce any other Advantages than the Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he had raiſed of himſelf, at once gained ſuch an Aſcendant in the Love of his Fellow-ſubjects, the Confidence of the Soldiery, the Eſteem of the Officers, the Reſpect of the Government, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Court, that all, with undiſguiſed u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous Suffrages, placed him in the Summit of this Command. We ſhall now ſee how he behav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf in it, how he proved himſelf worthy of it; as otherwiſe a General muſt have little Reaſon to value himſelf upon the moſt ſhining Succeſs.</p>
            <p>WHEN
<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Gazette of <hi>October</hi> 16, 1759.</note> General WOLFE appeared before <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bec,</hi> in the River of <hi>St. Lawrence,</hi> with his Troops, he found the Obſtacles to his intended Operations much greater than he had Reaſon to expect, or could foreſee, and chiefly from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Strength of the Country, which the Enemy ſeemed wiſely to depend upon. To complete their Security, Succours of all Kinds had been thrown into <hi>Quebec,</hi> and a numerous Body of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:008702_0021_102FBA62B31CE660"/>Troops, joined to the Troops of the Colony, filled up with every <hi>Canadian</hi> that was able to bear Arms, beſides ſeveral Nations of Savages, had taken the Field in a very advantageous Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
            <p>WHAT was the Proſpect of reducing a Place which was every Way ſo well prepared for a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Defence? General WOLFE could not flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter himſelf that he was able to effect it; yet, with his little Army, whoſe Courage and Reſolution he could depend upon, he hoped, if an Opportunity offered of attacking that of the Enemy, however ſuperior and formidable, he ſhould diſconcert their Meaſures by diſperſing them, and ſo as to facilitate with Succeſs an Attack upon the Town.</p>
            <p>THE Enemy were encamped along the Shore, and intrenched in every acceſſible Part. On his Landing upon the Iſle of <hi>Orleans,</hi> he found it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary both to poſſeſs himſelf of, and to fortify, the Point of <hi>Levi,</hi> and the Weſtermoſt Point of the Iſle; becauſe, from either the one or the other, the Enemy might make it impoſſible for any Ship to lie in the Baſon of <hi>Quebec,</hi> or even within two Miles of it. This Service being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with little Loſs, he ordered Batteries of Cannon and Mortars to be erected with great Diſpatch on the Point of <hi>Levi,</hi> to bombard the Town and Magazines, and to injure the Works and Batteries. The Enemy, perceiving theſe Works in great Forwardneſs, paſſed the River to attack and deſtroy them; but, falling into Confuſion, they fired upon one another, and went back; and the Effect of this Artillery was ſo great though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:008702_0022_102FBA6631134738"/>the River, that the Upper Town was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably damaged, and the Lower intirely deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>THE Variety of his other Diſpoſitions, Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems, and maſterly Strokes of Generalſhip, are ſtill ſo recent in every one's Memory, that a Detail of them is unneceſſary; and it will be ſufficient to ſay, that, to draw the Enemy from their Situation, and bring them to an Action, he at laſt formed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted that great Plan of conveying his Troops a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Town, after leaving the Points of <hi>Levi</hi> and <hi>Orleans</hi> in a proper State of Defence. He was but juſt then recovered from a dangerous Fit of Illneſs, yet his bodily Strength, as if not in the leaſt impaired, was ſo refreſhed by the Vigour of his Mind, that he was preſent in Perſon, active, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and indefatigable, wherever any Thing was to be done or ordered for taking an Advantage of the Enemy. Thus fulfilling, in his whole Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Character of <hi>Caeſar;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nil actum reputans ſi quid ſupreſſet agendum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND now the Enemy being obliged to quit their Poſt, collected the whole of their Forces, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to give Battle, which they could not avoid. General WOLFE, in the mean Time, put his little Army in extreme good Order, and diſplayed his Ranks ſo as to ſtrike a Terror into the Enemy by the Appearance of a far greater Number than he really had. Cool, provident, and prepared in this Manner for all Events, his Troops ſhewing, at the ſame Time, a Countenance mixed with Alacrity and Steadineſs, he received the Enemy's firſt Shcok,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:008702_0023_102FBA6C8242ACA0"/>which, as it is cuſtomary with them, was very briſk and animated. But this their Vivacity, from a little Check, is ſoon relaxed into the Debility of unreſiſting Languor; the Man degenerates into Woman, and can only exert a like impotent Strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle. WOLFE prudently reſerved his Fire till he was within forty Yards, and then it was ſo well continued, and with ſo good Effect, that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my every where gave Way. In this Onſet, a Muſquet-Ball pierced through, and ſhattered the Bone of his Wriſt; but, regardleſs of ſuch a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and deſperate Wound, he immediately wrapped it up, and, quite unconcerned, followed the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Blow he had juſt ſtruck, giving the Enemy no Time to recover from the Conſternation and Confuſion he had thrown them into. Then it was, in the Midſt of the Havock he was making, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and mowing down their Ranks, that, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Ball paſſing through his Body, he fell at the Head of his brave Grenadiers, as they were darting, like Lightning, to aſſail with their Bayonets.</p>
            <p>OH! WOLFE; what a melancholly Fall was this for thy Country, yet, glorious and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to thee, and ſtill more glorious and honourable by the Circumſtances that attended it! When faint and breathleſs, through the Effuſion of thy Blood, thou waſt, by the Mournful Miniſtry of a few Soldiers, carried off from that Scene of Victory, ready to proclaim thee the Conqueror of <hi>Canada,</hi> thou didſt, ſtill intent upon the Event, raiſe thy drooping Head, and check the mighty Conflicts of thy Soul, haſtening to ſever herſelf from thy Body: This thou didſt with new Life and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when the Shout of, <hi>They run,</hi> ſounded in
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:008702_0024_102FBA6ED545D4D0"/>thy Ears. Thou didſt aſk, with all the Eagerneſs of ſtrong Perturbation, <hi>Who run?</hi> and receiving the joyous Anſwer, that the Enemy were routed, with a complete and deciſive Overthrow, thou didſt reply, in tender Emotions for thy Country's Succeſs, <hi>Then, I thank God, I die contented.</hi> Peace and Compoſure, with theſe Words, ſealed thy Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids, and thy Head gently reclining, willingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned thy mortal Life.</p>
            <p>IF we ſearch the Records of Hiſtory for a Death like that of WOLFE, ſhall we find one, in all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, ſo Noble? Many have fought for their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and died in its Defence, perhaps with Sentiments of Magnanimity equal to his, and with as undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Reſolution to ſubmit to the Laws of Fatality; but how few, under his Circumſtances, have gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Death with ſuch attractive Charms, that what commonly is abhorred as an Evil, ſeems pleaſing, welcome, and deſirable? We praiſe then, we mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify ſuch a Death; we exult within ourſelves, that we can produce ſuch an Example to awake Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon a like Occaſion; and we even ſay, that ſo to die, is not to die in Effect, is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct and forgotten, but to live in the Memory of future Ages, till that Duration comes when Time ſhall be no more.</p>
            <p>WOLFE has acquired that Life of laſting Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; none envy it him; <hi>He flouriſhes like the Balm-tree, and ſhall be exalted as the Cedar of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon;</hi> every grateful <hi>Briton</hi> has already raiſed a Monument to him in his Breaſt; and Marble ſhall be taught, under the Hands of the Artiſt, to pay him its Homage, by all the emblematical Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrations of Heroiſm it is capable of expreſſing:
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:008702_0025_102FBA705A2CCA58"/>But what ſhall we further ſay, and what ſhall we feel, whilſt, with admiring Eyes, we ſurvey the Apparatus of this condign Pomp, whilſt the magnificent Objects convey to us an Idea of the Excellence they repreſent? We ſhall ſay, <hi>It is</hi> WOLFE <hi>that has deſerved all this:</hi> We can ſay no more; we feel the reſt; we feel the bright Effigies of his Glory making our Boſoms to pant, but its Beauties are not to be told; neither can we deſcribe its Height and Depth; the Imagination wanders in a Maze, and cannot figure out the exact Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurement.</p>
            <p>IF we place this Death of WOLFE in another Point of View, looking back to the Cauſe for which he died, a Cauſe no other than the Love of ſerving his Country; we ſhall have Reaſon to lament that Ardour which expoſed him ſo much to the Perils of War, and ſet open againſt him the greedy Jaws of Mortality before his Time; we ſhall imbibe a little Tincture of Jealouſy againſt the Monuments and Trophies, deſtined as if too ſoon to perpetuate his Memory; we ſhall accuſe as a little too haſty the putting him in Poſſeſſion of ſuch an Accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Glory. Juſt Regret! juſt Jealouſy; juſt Complaint! His Country has ſuffered by his Loſs; ſhe now is thoroughly ſenſible of it; ſhe wiſhes his Life had been protracted into a full Length of Days; and ſhe ſighs, apprehenſive of not finding a Man like him to fight her Battles.</p>
            <p>HENCE is the Source of Tears for WOLFE's Death, which refuſes to be intirely dried up; and hence the plaintive Voice of Grief, which has been beard from all Parts of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Realms. It
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:008702_0026_102FBA760A843708"/>will ſtill be renewed with the deepeſt Concern, whenever we approach that hallowed Ground where his precious Remains are depoſited, or viſit the Monuments conſecrated to his Memory. Thither we ſhall come inſpired with a reverential Awe for the Place! for the Virtues that guard its Precincts, with Frowns and ſtern Looks, bid the Prophane ſtand aloof. The pure in Heart and Well-wiſhers to their Country will come, and mourning in the Silence of their Hearts, will ſometimes ſtart with Surpriſe, and ſpeak within themſelves; "Then WOLFE is dead?—Surely he is gone too ſoon!— Propitious Heaven lent him only for a Day!— Death found him too fine a Victim!—And is he then dead? He who was the Author of ſo much Happineſs to us! He who was the Son of Honour, truly brave, truly noble, friendly and candid, gentle and beneficent, great and glorious!"</p>
            <p>BEHOLD, the Soldier comes! He whoſe Hands WOLFE had taught and fitted to battle, and whoſe Soul he had filled with Courage and Perſeverance: He mourns his Loſs in him, the beſt of Officers, becauſe with him his chief Happineſs is vaniſhed. WOLFE had always a Fellow-feeling for him; his Treatment of him was always humane; and he never let his Services paſs unrewarded. What Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, what Gratitude, what Willingneſs, what Confidence, what Ardour, muſt not Manners ſo conciliating in the General, excite and cheriſh in the Soldier!</p>
            <p>AND thou, lovely
<note n="*" place="bottom">Miſs <hi>L—th—r.</hi>
               </note> Maid! will come: Thou, to whom Choice, guided by Reaſon pointed out WOLFE as the deſerving Object of thy Affections. The innate Worth of his manly Soul kindled in
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:008702_0027_102FBA79547A89D8"/>thee the tendereſt Sentiments. He gave and thou didſt catch the Flame: Conſcious Love cannot ſinother its Fires; the Glow burſts out, and each Heart burns alike, and each Heart collects its Heat into the warmeſt Wiſhes for completing a laſting Union. The Decorum of Life and Virgin-Modeſty poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone the happy Day. In the mean Time, his Country's Cauſe calls WOLFE away. Love may bid him decline its Support; may paint with Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors to him the Aſpect of War; but he, mindful of the Dictates of Honour, and, above all, of the Duty he owes to his Country, removes, without Reluctance, from his Sight the Blandiſhments of Love, and all the alluring Sweets of domeſtic Eaſe and Felicity; and, though he fondly may deſire to embrace and enjoy them, for the Sake of her, and with her, who generouſly makes a Tender of them; yet they ought not, in his Opinion, to take Place of the Pleaſure that will ariſe from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of having done well in the Service and for the Love of our Country. The Way to theſe Pleaſures is beſet with Hardſhips, Difficulties, and Dangers; to the other ſmooth, eaſy, and ſecure: Yet it ſeemed not ſo eligible to WOLFE, who knew the ineſtimable Value of the pure Satisfaction of the Mind, and, at the ſame Time, did not ſlight the Gratification of Senſe, if it was in his Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces immediately conſiſtent with his Honour. Thou alſo, illuſtrious Maid, Mirrour of thy Sex! thou couldeſt not delight in the Man in whoſe Honour thy diſcerning Eye did perceive the leaſt Stain. Thou waſt as tender of WOLFE's Honour as he could be himſelf: He flew with thy Approbation and good Wiſhes to the Field of Glory, and fanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf ſufficiently happy, if he could at his
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:008702_0028_102F7547876E38C0"/>Return lay at thy Feet his Harveſt of Laurels. Alas! thou art too ſenſible how he was prevented; thy Sorrows need not be renewed; for the dear Image of his Virtues is ſo often preſent to thy Mind, that every Time thou wouldeſt gladly drop a Tear into his Urn.</p>
            <p>EVEN ſo, as <hi>Britons</hi> now their WOLFE, the <hi>Jews</hi> formerly lamented their <hi>Judas Maccabeus. They</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Maccab. c. ix. ver. 20, 21.</note> 
               <hi>bewailed him, and all</hi> Iſrael <hi>made great Lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for him, and mourned many Days, ſaying, how is the valiant Man fallen that delivered</hi> Iſrael! Juſt was the Cauſe of their Lamentation; for the <hi>fought</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. c. iii. ver. 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>with Chearfulneſs the Battle of</hi> Iſrael. <hi>He got his People great Honour, and put on a Breaſt-plate as a Giant, and girt his war like Harneſs about him, and he made Battles, protecting the Hoſt with his Sword. In his Acts he was like a Lion, and like a Lion's Whelp roaring for his Prey: For he purſued the Wicked, and burnt up thoſe that vexed his People. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Wicked ſhrunk for Fear of him, and all the Workers of Iniquity were troubled, becauſe Salvation proſpered in his Hand. His Memorial is bleſſed for ever.</hi> Cannot we ſay, after a cloſe Examination of the Features of this Pourtrait, but that WOLFE ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits a very ſtriking Reſemblance of them? His moral Character ſhewed the <hi>Judas Maccabeus</hi> in him; his military Character is only clouded by the Number of <hi>Judas</hi>'s ſignal Victories; but his Exit was as glorious.</p>
            <p>EPAMINONDAS, the great <hi>Theban</hi> Captain, (whom WOLFE alſo reſembles, as dying, like him, victorious over his Enemy) being aſked, which of his Friends he loved beſt; anſwered, that they
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:008702_0029_102FBA7F6A4482C8"/>muſt all die before he could be poſitive in deciding the Degree they held in his Eſteem. The ſame Thought has been adopted and improved by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but by all with the Intention of inculcating, that none can be deemed truly good and happy before they die, Death alone being the Teſt of their Actions, ſo far as it points out, by a juſt Meaſure, the Depravity and Rectitude diſcoverable in them. If <hi>Britons</hi> were now aſked the Queſtion, which of their Generals they love beſt; they would anſwer, without Heſitation, WOLFE; becauſe the Conduct of his whole Life was invariably the ſame, great and good, and Death authenticated and ratified this Greatneſs and Goodneſs, by affixing her Seal to it with an indelible Impreſſion. Other Generals, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned in Hiſtory for being great Maſters in the Art of War, appear in a very contemptible Light, when diveſted of the external Pageantry that obſcures the Deformity of their Actions in private Life: They are then the mere Man, and not the Hero. The Succeſs of their Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes, however obtruſive of the Ideas of Pomp and Grandeur on weak Minds, cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate the pernicious Effects of their Ambition, or Avarice, or Luſt, or Cruelties, or Oppreſſion. To gratify theſe inordinate Paſſions, they waded through a Sea of Blood; they led Armies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Field of Slaughter; they taught them the Way and Manner of butchering one another; and, in the End, inſtead of fighting the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of their Country in Support of its own Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency, or the Rights and Liberties of Mankind, they proved the mercileſs Deſtroyers of God's Creatures, and the Violaters of the moſt ſacred Laws of human Society. Death often ſeized upon them
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:008702_0030_102FBA820B7BE548"/>in the Midſt of their Havock and Outrages, and tranſmitted them, as they deſerved, deeply branded with the Ignominy of their enormous Guilt, to the Horror and Deteſtation of Poſterity. Not ſo with WOLFE: Without Ambition, Avarice, or any other Vice, his Talents were employed in Defence of the Independence of his Country, with which the Rights and Liberties of <hi>Europe</hi> are intimately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected: As another <hi>Judas Maccabeus, be fought with Chearfulneſs its Battle; his People by it got great Honour; be burnt up thoſe that vexed his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; Salvation proſpered in his Hand, and his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial is bleſſed for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GREAT GOD! juſt and terrible in thy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with what an humbling Blow to Humanity haſt thou ſtruck us, by the Death of our beloved General JAMES WOLFE! But, Lord, if thou doſt unſheath thy Sword, it is not to deſtroy, but to mend; it is not to blaſt our Hopes, but to make them ſpring with a fuller Bloom; it is not to cruſh us under the Weight of thy Vengeance, but to teach us to riſe ſuperior to all Diſaſters. Thou haſt in JAMES WOLFE ſet an Example to our Generals and Officers, that, by faithfully copying after it, they may learn to relinquiſh voluptuous Eaſe, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe Dangers and Difficulties, and, when neceſſary, fall gloriouſly, like him, for their Country. Stung and quickened by noble Emulation, behold they make ready to run for the Prize in the ſame Courſe of Glory. It is PITT, who, with thy divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, was appointed the tutely Genius of this Nation, that leads the Way with Precept. Thy Wiſdom has repleniſhed him with the good Gifts of deliberating maturely, judging ſoundly, counſelling ſecurely,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:008702_0031_102FBA850B3EF3B8"/>ordaining exactly, and executing effectually. He has introduced the Bleſſings of Harmony and good Underſtanding between our Commanders both by Sea and Land; they now no longer obſtruct the Nation's Welfare by Contradictions, Diſſenſions, and Diſobedience. Oh! may the Bleſſing conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue! And may we never want a PITT, under the auſpicious Influence of his Majeſty, to find for us another WOLFE; whoſe Loſs, though we are ſincerely afflicted for it, thy all-gracious Care, O God, has abundantly compenſated, by preſerving to us his Like in <hi>Amherſt, Monckton, Townſhend, Hawke,</hi> and <hi>Saunders!</hi>
